B004ZMWUCU|2.0|Like a good Irish scone...this book is loaded with sugar and low on fiber.  Entertaining enough and I finished it, but found it altogether uninspired.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it, nothing beats the first book but this comes pretty close. I've read it 3x now and (all books in order) I'm sure I'll read it again :-)
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A book to be read by all.  Really fascinating, shocking and so very insightful.  Far from taking this read lightly, I have a new perspective not only on North Korea, but on my own life.  When having a 'bad day' - I think of life in North Korea.  Wow - how tragic.

B00DZPVS9O|5.0|There are few bands that evoke a genre.. and there are more bands than not who lack the relevance and exceptionality that is the cornerstone of New Jersey’s own Monster Magnet.<br />Commercial success, battles to keep artistic identity intact and ten albums later you have a band that for  20+ years has successfully  fused garage rock, progressive rock, heavy metal, punk and psychedelia in a cinematic way that begs the listener to sonically arrive at a drive-in , attach the speakers and travel to a place that is both alien and familiar…a spot where Troma films play on heavy rotation, the snacks are dubious but you’re eating them anyway.<br />“Last Patrol” comes at a time when fans are clamoring to hear from their toxic avenger and lead singer Wyndorf is more than happy to lead you through and then back again..<br /> Wyndorf notes, “It’s a weird trip through the back alleys of a dark, retro-future, which not by coincidence very much resembles my own life. The lyrics aren’t fantasy really, rather a recounting of my musings on, observations of and general emotional reaction to my life and environment during a 1 week writing period in February of 2013. But I tend to use the vernacular and imagery of science fiction and surrealism to express myself and that’s where these lyrics get trippy.”<br />“Last Patrol” is Monster Magnet’s tenth studio album (Napalm Records) and a testament to everything they and Dave Wyndorf.. the mesmeric, magnetic, mastermind behind Monster Magnet are about.<br />The mood is set with track one “I Live Behind the Clouds” which is a slow, purposeful trip into a moonlit night..stripped down and glorifying in its musical bare bones , it gives a pedestal to Wyndorf’s deep gravel vocals…and before you know it  moves into the title track “Last Patrol”. Clocking in at over 9 minutes  -it gives Wyndorf the room he needs to explore lyrically-- knotty and full of twist and turns it exemplifies  the kind of poetic prowess that Wyndorf has given Monster Magnet for over two decades.<br /> “Paradise” and “Hallelujah”  demonstrate the yin and yang…smooth and velvety vocals and a primal scream of thrusting guitars and a steady back beat . “ The Duke (of Supernature)”  is Wyndorf at his sleazy, seedy , greasy best..think Alex Mitchell or Tom Englund but unprocessed and organic.<br />Produced by  MM member Phil Caivano , it’s clear that Caivano tapped into the atmosphere that swirls around and lifts Monster Magnet above the rest.<br />“Last Patrol” is rock-solid pure aural ecstasy..Wyndorf states he wanted to make a “midnight record”..and if “Last Patrol” is that, you won’t want daylight to break the mood.<br />-Kim Thore<br />All Access Magazine, LA<br />Uber Rock, UK<br />Maximum Metals that Wyndorf has given Monster Magnet for over two decades.<br /> “Paradise” and “Hallelujah”  demonstrate the yin and yang…smooth and velvety vocals and a primal scream of thrusting guitars and a steady back beat . “ The Duke (of Supernature)”  is Wyndorf at his sleazy, seedy , greasy best..think Alex Mitchell or Tom Englund but unprocessed and organic.<br />Produced by  MM member Phil Caivano , it’s clear that Caivano tapped into the atmosphere that swirls around and lifts Monster Magnet above the rest.<br />“Last Patrol” is rock-solid pure aural ecstasy..Wyndorf states he wanted to make a “midnight record”..and if “Last Patrol” is that, you won’t want daylight to break the mood.<br />-Kim Thore<br />All Access Magazine, LA<br />Uber Rock, UK<br />Maximum Metal

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't but into any of the hype when everyone was ranting and raving about the trilogy and just shrugged it off.  Then one of my co-workers was glued to it during her lunch break and kept telling me I HAD to read it but still, my interest wasn't piqued.  Then I got my Kindle and it showed up on one of the top seller lists and I figured, what the heck, plus it didn't hurt that I could now make this purchase anonymously on my kindle instead of having to go to the local bookstore (I have to admit I was a little ashamed).  However, I am so glad that I did.  I have to agree that the writing is a bit childish and definitely repetitive (try doing a search on your kindle for the word \\"murmur\\") but if you can get past that, the story really does pull you in.  I found myself up until 4am some nights because I just couldn't put the book down and HAD to know what happened next.  I completed the trilogy in a week.  At the core of the story you have a messed up guy with issues and a naive girl who thinks she can fix him...this basic premise has been applied in many other story lines (both written and film) and I'm certain has been the case in many lives as well.  I'm not a teenager by any means and like I said, I will admit the book has some faults but the story was captivating.  If you have a hard time letting go of reality and you want everything to be realistic and make perfect sense, this is not the book for you.  But if you just want a good, fun read and to get lost in the romance you might want to try it out.

Halfway through my mouth dropped open and I thought WTF?? and that was just the beginning.  I enjoyed this book so much I've recommended it to everyone and anyone that will listen.  If you enjoy mystery/suspense then this is a must read for you!

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great read, you really felt for the characters as you got to know them more.  As is usually the case, the book was way better than the movie.  If you plan on reading the book I would suggest skipping the movie, all it did was annoy me how much they changed stuff.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Tried too many times on my kindle. Keeps saying the same so i dont Like it  as much as i use to. Please fix this soon

B00027JYLC|5.0|Great movie and entertaining to say the least. I remember watching this a long time ago once and then never saw it again. Had a great story line of difference in life.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|this book included a lot of useful lessons and thoughts about what marriage and commitment really means (not the Hollywood version).  as someone who is 68 years old, divorced twice after 43 years of marriage, I sure wish I would have understood more of what she said, so very eloquently.  I sent copies of the book to two young women, one 24 and contemplating marriage, and one 37 with one failed marriage.  I think there are great lessons for both of them.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book offers a new look at a new topic within the IT management world.  I found that as a story it had some issues with dialogue and plot, but not so much that I wasn't able to enjoy the read. I am definitely going to continue my research and investigation of the tenets of DevOps and all that it can now offer in this rapidly changing IT business landscape.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I only made it about 50 pages, but it seemed like it was using generic fantasy tropes and very thin characters.  Maybe it got better after that, but there was nothing encouraging for me to take the time to try.

0545265355|5.0|both my husband and myself LOVE the hunger games trilogy. it was great to get them in hardcover in a box - and it was cheaper than buying them individually
1401917232|2.0|I gave this book a poor rating, which I will let stand for now, but I am reading the book a second time, more slowly, as A&P advise Gary to read.  I gobbled it all in one day the first time, so that in itself may account for my tummyache.  I spent a whole day on the internet investigating the 'conspiracy theory' that I and others have objected to in the book.  To my dismay, I am convinced.  And I see that this has an exact parallel with my progress in the Course in Miracles.  We believe a total illusion!  We believe an interpretation of everything we see that is provided to us by a voice (whether you want to call it the media, or the government, or the ego) that lies.  This is a huge lesson for me - to see how easily I can be duped.  Now I understand why Gary's book included something that on the surface appears to be just sensational and have nothing to do with A Course in Miracles.  Well-written or not, I'm thinking that maybe everything that is in the book is in there for a good reason.<br /><br />************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />REVIEW AFTER FIRST READING STARTS HERE:  This book is about the Lessons of Gary, as one of the chapters is titled.  The book itself is one of his lessons, both the writing of it, and now the receiving of criticism about it.  Like quite a few other reviewers, I am a long time student of the Course, a huge fan of Gary's first book, and less enthusiastic about the second book.  Personally, I thought this third one was pretty bad.  I won't go into detail, because other critics have already expressed much of what I found disappointing about the book.  I will note that I had heard all the jokes from Gary before.  New jokes next time, G!  Or no, even better, no formal jokes.  They may be helpful in a talk, but are not necessary in a book.  The viagra thing was very funny, as was the zipper story.  Just let the humor come spontaneously.<br /><br />Since Gary and I are One (no, I have never met him), then this book is about the Lessons of Me.  I like to write.  Sometimes I write stuff that isn't so good.  That's really ok, Gary/Me.  Because you know what?  The Course in Miracles is about practice.  Practice, practice, practice.  A&P told Gary he had to write the book himself this time instead of relying on taped conversations.  That's one reason I think it might not be as good as the first two.  Gary is learning.  We are allowed to learn.  I am allowed to be less than perfect as an ego.  In fact, I can't help it.  Trying to perfect my ego was a doomed project that absorbed the first 25 years of my study of ACIM.  \\"I will stand back and let Him lead the way,\\" is a lesson I am focusing on right now.  Mostly I don't do it - I opinionate instead of listening.  Right now I am opinionating on purpose, but maybe HS will slip a few things in while I'm not looking.<br /><br />If I were going through a divorce, adjusting to a new wife and a new address, being audited by the IRS, traveling all over the world, and dealing with increasing pressure to get a book done, I am quite sure I'd have written a less than perfect book.  In fact, I'm am quite sure that I'd have written no book at all.  So my hat is off to Gary for finishing a difficult project.  All authors write some better and some less better stuff.  Just keep practicing Gary, for all of our sakes.  You never claimed to be a great writer, so just let the chips fall on this one.  I will read everything you write because I am interested in the whole process, the trajectory of a life, the Life of Gary.  Thanks for making a spectacle of yourself for the benefit of all.  ;-)<br /><br />Don't take our criticisms too hard.  Your book may be less than I had hoped for, but your whole life story is what teaches, and is interesting to me  --- and I am grateful that you make it so public.  Remember that line about limitations?  \\"Do not despair, then, because of limitations.  It is your function to escape from them, but not to be without them.  If you would be heard by those who suffer, you must speak their language.  If you would be a savior, you must understand what needs to be escaped.\\"  You are putting yourself out there Gary, as a perfect example of this.  Because I learn so much from you, I learn that my limitations will not stop others from learning from me, but will actually help them identify with me.<br /><br />I did get two important and helpful insights from this book.  One is the importance of seeing each other as everything - the mistake of seeing another as an illusion.  The other was the explanation for why I find it difficult to stay in the Now, to stay in a really peaceful state of mind.<br /><br />I believe that every teacher and every teaching has certain people who will be attracted to and helped most by him/her/it.  The Course helps me the most, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying and learning from Abraham-Hicks, Eckhart Tolle, Sanaya Roman, among others.  When the Jehovah's Witness ladies used to call on me, I learned from them too.  I think when Gary and Arten and Pursah make comments about other teachings, it is to distinguish them from the Course, not to put the others down.  OK - enough opinions for one review.<br /><br />Sarita
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Great plot with a fantastic ending, lots of twists and turns. I love Harry Hole, he is unique, quirky, flawed and brilliant. I think this is a must read book.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|After a difficult start (I found it hard to get into this book at first) I was soon swept away and could not stop. Gone Girl is such a clever mix of love, deceit and cunning that you can't help but keep reading. I couldn't put this book down in he end. Can't wait for the movie...Ben Affleck as Nick is simply Perfect!

B0036R92V2|3.0|Inspired by Sergio Leone's \\"Man With No Name\\" trilogy, another Italian Sergio (Corbucci) keeps the genre popular worldwide with this violent but fun film.  Starring a young (23) blue-eyed stud with a shortened name of Franco Nero, the movie is pretty simple and follows the Leone formula.<br /><br />Django (Nero) walks throughout the film dragging a coffin behind him using an attached rope.  We don't know what happened to his normal transportation.  Filmed in Italy and Spain, the setting is the U. S. /Mexican border just after the Civil War.  Django is a former Union soldier (still wears the yellow striped pants) headed for a small town on the Mexican side.  Along the way he finds a woman who is being beaten by a handful of Mexicans.  After dispatching them quickly with his six-shooter, another group of horsemen arrive.  These are Americans but wear red scarves or hoods, suggesting an element of the Klan.  They suffer a fate similar to the Mexicans.<br /><br />Django takes Maria (Loredana Nusciak) with him into town.  Django's goal is to avenge his wife who died at the hand of one of the equally evil group of bad guys.  Either the Mexican revolutionaries led by Gen. Rodriguez (Jose Bodalo) or more likely, the red KKK dudes and their leader Maj. Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo).  Jackson is so evil that he dispatches young Mexicans one at a time to run up a hill, before shooting them with his rifle as target practice.  While Django is adept with his handgun, he only has one and it only has six bullets.  So to everyone's surprise he invites Jackson to bring his 40 member gang into town for a final shootout.  Naturally Django has a surprise waiting.<br /><br />Corbucci who wrote the story as well as directed the film, is brutal with his confrontations.  Kids are killed, ears are severed and hands are crushed along with the unusually severe beatings.  Keeping with the times of 1966, it's not overly gory, but would surely earn an \\"R\\" rating, even today.  The film has plenty of logic-distancing scenes as well as some continuity issues.  And there are some noticeable blunders that might leaving one shaking their head.  Still, considering the budget and the scope, \\"Django\\" is a film worth seeing if you are a Western film aficionado.  \\"Django\\" continued on with several sequels and was fondly remembered by filmmaker Quinton Tarantino as evidenced by his 2012 film \\"Django Unchained\\" which featured a brief cameo by Nero.<br /><br />The Blu ray adaptation has some problems but is overall well done.  The film begins with an optional introduction by Nero and the following disclaimer: The print used was \\"transferred from its original camera negative, which contained some intermittent age-related damage.\\"  And yes, it's pretty evident.  There are a couple incidents of a pause between scenes.  In other cases, the picture fluctuates from scene to scene.  There is some unusually heavy grain in evidence in some frames.  Having said all that, at least they told us.  And in reality, most of the film looks very good.  Excellent color, good detail and contrast.<br /><br />I wasn't exactly thrilled with the audio either.  We get two DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (1.0) tracks.  One is in the original Italian with English subtitles.  The other is an English dubbed version.  I watched the dubbed version for a few minutes but didn't like Nero's voice actor.  It also seemed like the translation didn't always make sense.  This was verified when I went over to the Italian and the subtitles were in fact different.  Neither audio version is all that strong in either case.  The film begs for a more immersive track.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />Extras include an interview with Nero and asst. director Ruggero Deodato, a 10 minute film starring Nero called  'The Last Pistolero.'  There is also a 1968 documentary featuring several filmmakers about the \\"Spaghetti Western Phenomenon.\\"ogic-distancing scenes as well as some continuity issues.

B000OVLINI|4.0|The Shadow of the Wind is an intriguing and beautiful novel that did end up a little more &#34;fluffy&#34; than I would have expected, but I enjoyed it very much nonetheless. If you want a mystery romance novel in an interesting setting, as opposed to a deep and serious war novel, you will like this book.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Loved this movie in the theaters; lots of action from the very beginning to the end. Moved from one action sequence to another quickly. Wasn't a huge Brad Pitt fan, but this movie made me one. I thought he did a great job.<br /><br />Love getting the DVD and Blu-Ray together; Digital Copy may come in handy but don't really care about that now.<br /><br />Good price at Amazon; beat all other prices whether online or in-store.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is not a pleasant book to read, but a must for anyone who wants to get even a tiny understanding of the impact of combat.  What these men endured is hard to imagine yet they did.  It clearly shows the depravity of man.  What good men do in unthinkable situations is chilling.

B004LROUW2|5.0|Murakami's themes of loss and great longing come through this work, weaving older works through this novel. His fantastic application of alternate universes and the fact that time is not linear is profound and a great relief to those of us who want to believe there is more that just what we perceive.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I saw this on a tech website and decided to give it a go since it was 35 bucks and I was tired of hooking my laptop up to my TV via HDMI when I wanted to watch a movie on a bigger screen.  I've got to say that 35 dollars was quite well spent.  It works perfectly with the Amazon prime movies when I cast it from Chrome on my laptop, and Youtube from my Galaxy S3 casts effortlessly. I love how you can queue the TV on the phone, and how easy it is for other smartphones to use the device as well (my family essentially has three remotes!) I've used Google Music from my phone a couple times, and that worked great, but definitely not as useful as the other two ways I mainly use it for.  I know Google is working on other apps for the casting to work, but for me, this was already worth the money for the convenience it provided.
B002RXTWWA|5.0|This is one of the greatest monster films to what Universal could do. If a Frankenstein lover would love this classic film, this is definitely the greatest monster film to every Halloween lover. I recommend to every monster lover!
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a bit boring.  Maybe it is just not my taste.  I go like watermelon but that is another story.  Okay, the game is okay if you have absolutely nothing on this earth else to do.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Excellent complete movie collection! The blu-ray quality is unsurpassed and adds to the perfection! Bonus features are great and if you loved &#34;Rocky&#34; from it's inception, this is the ultimate collector's dream come true! Own this in your collection and it will not disappoint!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|what can I say...I just love angry birds of any kind. This is fun especially when I am bored or angry myself.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Finally a book written for us by one of us. This us not a self help book on how to get better but a book on how to use your best - You!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Fun game with nice graphics. My son seems to enjoy it. It does a good job of keeping pop ups to a minimum.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Puts the dynamics of law of attraction in attainable practice. Combines understanding of the power of the spirit and the power within.
0985557834|3.0|I saw this book at a book store and was entranced by it.  I stood there looking through it for probably 20 minutes.  Then I looked at the price and was like whoa.  That's like half the price of the Ashley book of knots and only maybe 30 knots.  Not a good knot per dollar ratio there.  I went home and kept on thinking about how nice those knots looked so I eventually bought it here on amazon for a somewhat better knot/dollar ratio.<br /><br />I started tying some of the knots and was a little disappointed.  The knots are ok.  A lot of them I've done before just by playing around with rope, I just never saw them look so good.  All of the knots in the pictures are like super models, I wouldn't be surprised if some of these pictures were airbrushed.  I got a little disappointed when I tried to tie the Royal Crown Sinnet.  My knot just didn't look quite the same as in the picture.  I thought ok maybe I just didn't tighten it right.  Then I went on to the Surreal Solomon bar and that's when I knew I had reason to be disappointed.  When I tied that one it had a really strong twist, but the picture showed it nice and flat and straight.  Looking at the mechanics of the knot it's very clear that it should be twisting, even in the picture.  It must have been straightened out just for the photoshoot.  That's when I started to feel like I'd been cheated.<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't be complaining.  It seems like this book is more about how to get knots to look really pretty which is certainly a reasonable objective for many people buying this book.  Just keep in mind some of these knots don't naturally look that way and some of them don't keep their shape very well.  If you wiggle them or shake them or pull on them the wrong way they will change or start to go back to their natural state, and that's only some of them, not all.<br /><br />That's pretty much the end of my review but if you're asking \\"what would this guy want other than a book on how to get knots to look pretty?\\"then read on.  This is just my feelings though, more like a blog.<br /><br />I got into knots when I noticed how perfect a basic knot was in it's natural state.  To me a knot's natural state is the position that all of the parts just want to be in naturally because that's mechanics.  Questioning why a knot is the way it is is like questioning why there are three dimensions to space, or why six pennies fit perfectly around a single penny.  It just is what it is.  That's the rules of the world we live in.  A knot is one of those basic constructs of reality and there's an endless number of knots that can be tied (but only a few of them are useful or look nice to us).  Some of the knots in this book seemed manipulated and unnatural to me and that put me off.  Sounds kinda lofty but I guess I give three stars because I wasn't able to see the beauty of the universe by looking at these knots.  It's like knots are my drug and this was the cheap stuff haha.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|It was a long wait, but this is an excellent follow up to the Shining. I love the characers, the story, the evil that needs to be crushed. Scared, but still kept reading it late in to the night. Classic Stephen King,
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|Parts were entertaining.  Chemistry wasnt really there between Reynolds and Bridges - compare with MIB.  Individually actors were good.  Ending was bleh...do not want a sequel.  Not in MIB league.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow is of course gorgeous and Tim McGraw is well cast in his &#34;non singing&#34; role (he does sing a duet with Paltrow in the trailer and extras footage). The plot is heart rending despite being relatively simplistic. The glue that holds this movie together and makes it worth watching, perhaps more than once, are the Songs and the supporting actors who sing them.  I'm surprised that these songs haven't received airtime on mainstream radio.  There's little doubt that the television series NASHVILLE got it's inspiration from this.  If you like movies heavily oriented towards the music, in this case Progressive Country, you'll love this.
B001HBWY8M|4.0|Good family movie, it is will made. I would watch I with my grandkids. Down load the preview and see for yourself.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Good book. I got to know the characters and like them. Just when you think that you have figured it out it takes a left turn. Can't wait for further books from this guy.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This was a fun movie. I liked it way better than the second Iron Man. The monologue between him and the boy was great.
0345803485|5.0|starts out a little off but the more you read the less you want to put it down. great romantic story. wish i would have bought the set of 3 and not only this one!
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I loved the first one and was disappointed by this one. I thought some of the scenes were great. It was very well made. It lacked something, but did buy it as I like to watch it.
0374533571|5.0|much better than the movie. if you enjoyed the movie, read the book-goes into more detail than movie did. i 'd recommend it
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|We loved the croods! My 5 year old picked it out and it was a great movie for the whole family. Great family movie!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|this is a get app you can take video and lots other i love it you can change the theme and it is really clear and easy to use it is a must have
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|With so many apps to choose from, this is a good one to use.  I find that old school hands on calculator is used much more.  It is nice to have though when I need it.
0590259385|5.0|I am so in LOVE with this book! Too cute, and who doesn't love llamas? Shipped just in time to send as a gift for a baby shower.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I thought it would be great to schedule alarms but I am still using my phone as an alarm clock.  If you don't have another source for an alarm though this does work and you can set multiple alarms.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|As a Barbra Streisand fan for me a must have in my collection but also a beautifully filmed movie, one of my absolute favourites
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well written, drew me in. The history of American slave times are complex. The author did a masterful job of taking us through the heads of all sides. As a black American, I was touched and appreciated how well she served compassion to each character. Great read. If you liked the Help, you'll like the Kitchen House. As an author myself, I can appreciate the exhaustive effort she went through to share this story that surely is not far from a searing truth of someone's life.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Our family (ages 5 - 45) really enjoyed this movie on family movie night.  There's a great lesson built into a fun movie.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I go way back with Star Trek. It was a stroke of genius to change this series of movies to an alternate time line. The one thing you don't want to do is mess with what has been, because we remember.<br /><br />This installment is fast paced and packed full of action and drama. The story line is wonderfully woven in and out of the original time line so those of us who are Trekers don't feel left out or that they are changing what has been.<br /><br />This was our first time watching a 3D movie at home and this blew us away. I sometimes feel that 3D takes away from the movie. You spend so much time looking at the effects you miss the story. This movie balance everything very well. The 3D effects completely complimented and enhance the movie experience.<br /><br />Next... Ironman 3D
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was good and I probably would have rated it higher had I not read the book.  The book was awesome and I cannot say enough good about it.  The movie was not as good as the book, and of course it couldn't be without being at least 6 hours long!<br />:-). That being said, I would recommend this movie, but if you have read the book, it will be disappointing.
B0078N2T8I|3.0|A friend of mine kept telling me how great this movie is -- So, I finally gave in and paid to see it. Perhaps, after listening to my friend go on and on, I expected too much. It wasn't a bad movie -- however, I expected more.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game so much. I can not wait to get the second one. This game is worth the price.
B0040I09RM|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Charlie would have been the best Christopher Grey ever but would not want to miss a second of him on SOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Love, love love this show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Excellent family movie! My kids loved it! I was hesitant to rent it after some of the reviews but I'm so glad I watched it. Great movie!
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|The Lego Minecraft was purchased as a gift, and the product arrived prior to the expected arrival date and the toy was in excellent condition.  It was well represented in the description on the Amazon site,  The price was less than advertised in the local stores carrying this toy.  I would recommend Amazon for all your shopping at home needs.
B005HEE60E|5.0|Many episodes in this season had a theme behind it.  It is nice to think about when this show was aired and see what points they were making.  The also explored the relationships of Kirk, Bones and Spock as expected.
1439102813|5.0|We bought this book because a friend recommended it since our mother has Alzhiemers.  This book is true to life
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Required review for everyone interested in History, Economics, Politics and the reasons of nations´ success or failure. Very well written, easy to follow, a book to read with increasing interest every single page.
1568363850|5.0|It came EXACTLY as I ordered and I'm really happy with this book. It came with the CD and the book looks like new because it came almost empty and clean. I highly recommend to buy it if your are going to study this interesting language!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a very good book and a real page turner. I can't wait to read another one of his books.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Always fails at signing in says sorry taking to long poo never worked on any network even after a restart on kindle fire hd
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Ok love this completely....keeps my mind occupied while.on bed rest. Keeps my haands busy too. Love that I am getting better and better at it
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory has a more modern style of writing, and I enjoy the historical accounts of unusual women, which Jean Plaidy has  not written about. Philippa will certainly bring us more wonderful books, treating women who lived at the sidelines of history, but certainly as important, if not more so as the queens and princesses.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME surprisingly it's still free I think they should do a daily thing were you can get bananas but I really like the game it's fun and so I addicting  hope you liked my review
B0087EVHTE|4.0|Very fast, came on time, quite pleased with the intel hd graphics 2500. I didn't plan on overclocking so I didn't bother getting the 3570k
B00915G6MG|5.0|It's amazing that this production has managed to not just maintain, but improve year after year for 10 years...I can't wait to see how season 11 turns out.  One incredible show.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Have enjoyed playing this game. Fairly lengthy play, not over burdened with hidden object searches, fairly good graphics and the mini games aren't so hard that you want to pull your hair out. Must admit that I did purchase this on sale and that I wouldn't have paid $4.99 for this game though. Seems a bit pricey if not caught on sale. Overall it is a good game.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|I bought my first book from amazon back in 1996. It was Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintainence and it took about 6 weeks to deliver to me in New Zealand. So I've enjoyed racing through this very readable book about amazon and bezos, getting a good peak behind the scenes, recalling much of the history (but from a customer and techy point of view).  Bezos thinks about the world differently than most and it's nice to get a glimpse of that.<br /><br />This book is like a cross between Howard Shultz's first book and the recent Steve Jobs book by Isaacson, though I didn't feel like I got to know Bezos, the man, rather than the business man, as well as the other two. It is a good book.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The writers continue to parody current political events with striking yet fictionalized accounts of celebrity politicians, businessmen and old legal cases.  Can you find Klaus von Bulow?  Rahm Emanuel?  Mark Zuckerberg? Or can you? The parodies are striking yet lovable - giving entr&eacute;e to a world none of us may ever know.  Certainly we are behind the doors and behind the minds and teeth of high-powered big city legal council.  It's a feast.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It's silly and pointless and full of the same new age garbage we've all heard for years.  I was hoping for more from a neurologist but no luck.  I guess there isn't any 'more' there.
1589946901|4.0|Have not played it enough to give it a over the top understanding of the game review, but It pretty cool.  I got it because I grew up liking Blood bowl as a kid, but don't really want to own miniatures.  And the PC game doesn't work for me because I don't have a pc, and I don't really like the graphics to the PC game.  This game lets me have the funny cool background of Blood bowl with out needing to spend a lot.<br /><br />In terms to getting people to play this initially can be a challenge. If you know anyone that knows and Likes Blood bowl it won't be a problem.  But If you know people that Love Fantasy but not football it can be a hard sell.....And if they like football they probably don't car to much about playing a fantasy game.  But if you do get them to play this game and that they like thinking about strategy they well probably like to play this a lot.....its just getting the first time to play being a problem.  But hopefully you have the ultimate and rare fan nerd that like Football and fantasy! I know there out there.<br /><br />I do think the game play is awesome, and have all the different cards to fight over and passing the ball around is great.  I have heard it being called a little bit of a deck builder, but it really isn't, because you don't go through the deck half as much as you should for something like a deck builder to be useful....It is more like a Deck Evolving game, were there well just get a handful of extra cards added to the deck to make it better, but your deck doesn't change to a point that you wouldn't recognize it  from the beginning of the game to the end of the game.  There are a lot of pieces to the game, and help make it seem complicated.  There  a couple of different tokens, normal sized cards  and little cards, I feel like the small cards should just be normal cards, (its my preference, they could have easily been bigger, but i guess its to not confuse them? If i had baby hands they would work for me)  I even think some of the tokens could have been cards to.) the tokens just spread the game out on the table)  The only thing i question is the cheat tokens really take your strategies and make it really random if you win or lose a match..But hey, its BLOOD BOWL, your suppose to cheat!( I have a love hate with he cheat tokens, but I'm more on the Liking them than hating them, cheating is fun...but random) and you can always play a team that doesn't cheat as much as another.<br /><br />I do think the art work is really Great! but i think its probably taken from other places.....but those places had awesome art so who cares!<br /><br />The box that it comes in is probably the worst thing.  The inside is useless and probably well get thrown out when your sick of it.  The storage of the box is pretty cheaply done and your on your own on how to organize it.  Everything comes in zip lock backs so there is that! and you can keep them in there and its fine, but there isn't a molded plastic or anywhere tight to put the cards so they won't move around.. there is a cardboard flap that helps them from moving, but you need to keep them in the ziplock bag because its to short the cards well slide away.<br /><br />All and all its a great game, and all my complaints are there just to let people know whats up, there really not a turn off to me, there small complaints.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This show continues to meld humor with science with award winning writing. A must-have for today's \\"nerds\\"<br />Season 1-5 need to be seen to appreciate even more this brilliant Season 6.<br />[...]
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|After reading &#34;Cutting Right to the Chase&#34;, I was super excited to see the release of this new e-book featuring the charming and mysterious detective Chase Williams. Though, to be honest, I was expecting to get to know a bit more about his past life... Maybe in the next book!<br /><br />This time it was nice to see Stefania Mattana challenging herself with a longer and more complex text. It was also nice to find again all of the characters from her older short stories.<br /><br />The story is very well-written and the plot is incredibly clever. I couldn't understand who the murderer was till the very last bit of the book (that is - when it's actually revealed!), even if I tried to pay attention to the smallest details. I won't say anything to avoid any possible spoiler.<br /><br />I love Mattana's writing style because it's smooth but polished at the same time. Now I'll patiently wait for her next book and for more glimpses of Chase's life in Italy.<br /><br />I suggest you get this e-book - if you like crime stories it won't disappoint you, and the price is ridiculous for such good quality.

B005OYHPPA|5.0|Excellent, usually rather easy to prepare, recipes. A wonderful cookbook to offer as a gift:  always appreciated.<br />Beautiful photographs that draw one in, yearning to re-create and to present at one's own table.<br />I especially enjoy using spices that I have probably enjoyed at  restaurants  but have never used in my own cooking.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I am always captivated be Sanderson's ability to weave a great tale full of action, suspense and surprising turns.  And, in the midst of all the action develop characters you love and relate to.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Once in a blue moon a book comes along that I feel should be mandatory! It isn't usually a text book.Quiet: is for everyone raising children..in a relationship..working in a cubicle, a private office or a taxi cab!!! Every occupation that deals with children..every person in the stock market...politicians...mental health professionals...athletes...lovers...warriors and that quiet person reading alone at home.!!.The research about Introvert vs Extrovert is eye popping and mind blowing..Susan Cain will go down in history. Sometimes we desperately need facts not fiction!! If you want to understand your spouse,children,friends,co-workers,and yourself it's all here in one book!! I can't urge you enough to read this important masterpiece!!!
B0019I6WDG|1.0|On a second viewing, this movie is overly written, glib, unrealistic and obnoxious.  Don't know how I ever thought it was charming!  Ugh.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I wanted to go to a live show, have watched a few times love to watch.<br /><br />Plan to watch today.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I have a Nexus 7 tablet, an iphone 5c and an iMac book pro and it works with all of them! Great sound, absolutely no loss of sound quality! You will not be sorry you bought this! I can now use my  ihome docking station no matter what the device.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great actors and plot.  Keep me interested from start to finish.  Love the new Captain Kirk and Spock. Highly Recommend!
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is a very fun, addivtive game.  Sure, you match 3 or 4 vertically or horizontially but all the little critters are the exact same length and width.  It's timed which just adds to the excitement and after playing for a while, I finally got above the 8th level!  But I've yet to get there twice!  Try this game!  You'll love playing it!<br />Judy W
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Was fun. Great graphics.  Hidden object games are my favorite and this one is really good. Will probably purchase full game..
B000I55YV2|5.0|I must say that this movie was very impressive. The plot was very interesting and easy to follow, and the characters played their parts well. I have absolutely no complaints about the movie.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|The car moves too fast. It's very hard to control the direction of the car, that the car always runs on the grass. I'm unable to complete any challenge within allocated time.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Victor Frankl's story is an incredible one. Far be it for me to attempt to describe his life story and convictions, but I will say my take home message is that we have choices. Those choices, linked to others at many levels, give us a unique opportunity to do miracles. Be and do your best, love, helping others, and count your days not as if they shall end, but as if have each day accrues that much more.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It's a nice appeal to caring for others.I would recommend it to others. It really holds your attention though out the film.
B008AT71WI|5.0|if you like science fiction and musicals it is old but still funny and the music is some thing that u will hum
B005MMZ63C|3.0|Okay, I watched this because it is a cultural icon... you hear people refer to it all the time as the greatest movie of all time and I figured I should watch it.  It wasn't bad, by any means.  I haven't watched a black and white film in some time and I was struck by how crisp it appeared.  I love the contrast and clarity of this film.  I thought the story line was merely okay.  I imagine it had much more significance when it was originally made.  As I understand it, Kane was loosely based upon a real newspaper magnate of the time.  It is always nice to watch older cinematography, showing things that were new back then that we take for granted today.  Orson Wells did a fine job, and I enjoyed seeing how they aged the actors.  All in all, not a bad movie, but with less of an impact on me from my modern perspective than I was hoping for.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Martin is a master of fantasy and suspense.  These books are some of the best I've read!  The mix of political intrigue and light fantasy is a brilliant combination that keeps you on the edge of your seat
B00003CXIP|5.0|I enjoy &#34;Stand By Me&#34; a lot, it takes me back to when I was a kid growing in late 1950's in Nebraska. It's  great story telling of young kids growing up in a time now long gone, also some good young actors in this film. Love music in film also. Just a great little gem of a film for all ages to see.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's awesome, good guns, good graphics, good game and it's FREE!!! It's well worth it. Go get it, like now.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Was glad to get the 6th Season so I now have all of them.  Intelligent and funny!  Hope you get hooked on it, too.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|A wonderful tribute to the man and the legend that is George Martin. The video, the pictures from behind the scenes make this well worth purchasing. I enjoyed the intimate conversations he illicits from the famous artists he made better. Wished it was longer. Divulging his secrets to a first rate Martini, priceless. To all fans of quality music: &#34;Buy this DVD.&#34;
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|The quality of the picture and sound is excellent! Love how well the new FX shots look. Will buy the entire season as it comes out!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was an outstanding book. I could relate many things with the events that took place. From the begging to end, it kept my interests up. I said good bye to Mill with tears eyes.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Again, always respect Robert Downey's work. Nevertheless, felt like the story line, the script, was weak on this film. However, it is watchable and entertaining...one full bowl of popcorn.
B003DZX3US|5.0|This movie only gets better with time!! It's a classic that I could watch over and over again. Now I don't have to wait for Disney to release it from the vault again.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I purchased this season so that my mother, who recently moved in with us, could watch the show and join us for our Sunday night ritual of watching new run episodes.  I do not like horror movies and I especially do not like Zombies.  However, there is much more to this series than the Zombie fright.  The charachters are well developed and empathy is easily developed for them.  Give it a try!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I gave this five stars because this story kept me glued to my kindle until I finished.  The villains are the bullies you've grown up hating, the action is steady, and the is a surprise around every corner.  I think rothfus May be the Steven King of fantasy someday.<br />I'm
0307476073|5.0|I have read several memoirs of hiking the AT and other longer trails, and this one is beautiful. A critical reader, I was truly amazed at Strayed's ability to draw me so far into the emotional landscape of her life. At times, I cried. Other times, I felt incredibly squeamish. Many times, I laughed. It is one of those books that I never wanted to end and for me, book like those are a rarity. I would use sections of this book in my creative writing classes, for certain
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Like a sophisticated world wide Forrest Gump. Pleasant unlikely characters. There are many great lines here so get your highlighter out.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. The scenery and the music complement this epic tale on the early American frontier.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I always anticipate a new book from Frederick Forsyth. This was no exception. The book was technically well written  ,fast paced and enjoyable reading.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is a true American Hero.  This book is a great look into the dedication, skill and true professionalism and patriotism of our special forces.  They give it all every day to keep us safe. Freedom is not free.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Luttrell for your service, you are a true American hero.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A powerful read that captured my attention immediately. Characters came to life through their own personality, and the world Howey imagines feels real. This novel is worthy of its stellar reviews. A television series spin off will one day become popular culture. Thank you Hugh.  You're shaping the future, and deepening the awareness of hope.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book was outstanding! I went to high school with Chris and wish I would have kept in better touch with him. He is a great man and patriot and will be missed.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Because it's an awesome premise with unlimited variations and possibilities.  With the exception of SG Universe, this franchise was one of the best enjoyed in the history of my life!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great way to past time and very responsive on the kindle fire hd.  Easy to use and great graphics.  Get it you won't be disappointed,
0793518326|4.0|. . . but some proofreading is warranted if there is a next edition---- there are some incorrect lyrics and some rhythmic errors (the intro riff to &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; is wrong, for example) here and there, a C major chord is written when it's clearly a C minor (&#34;Girl&#34;) to name a couple of instances.  But, give the mammoth scope of the project, it's not bad.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|This version is as good as the new version with DiCapri.  It follows the book line and a little closer.  Loved it.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love the Withings Pulse! It is an unobtrusive little tracker, I just clip it to my bra or the inside of my jeans pocket to keep it out of the way & continue with my day. I love seeing my stats at the end of the day, and the seamless syncing with my Withings app is another plus. Does exactly what it is supposed to; it is helping me with my weight loss & healthy lifestyle goals.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I know I can rely on this book for anything that I may need to remember how to do while building my book.  Simple to understand as well.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Both my 1 year old and 4 year old play with this toy a lot. It is one of my favorites.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought a Kindle which I wanted to offer as a gift. So I needed the EU power adapter and the USB cable. I received the adapter twice, but the cable was always missing! So finally I received the cable too and could offer the Kindle in due time.<br />With Amazon, customer satisfaction is not just a simple word! Thank you efficiency.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this series. I would recommend this to anyone. The books are amazing and they keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time
B00DW1WR14|4.0|For me, Pearl Jam have redeemed themselves with this album.  Now right away I should say that I consider Binaural to be Pearl Jam's best album - which puts me in a very small minority of PJ fans.  For that reason, I hear this album differently than another Pearl Jam fan who would regard Yield as their best album.<br /><br />Sirens and Mind Your Manners worried me a bit.  Sirens seemed very pop to me, although it's a beautiful song.  And Mind Your Manners seemed too derivative of riffs they've written before.<br /><br />But as it turns out, Lightning Bolt falls into the more experimental collection of Pj's works, along with Vitalogy, No Code, Riot Act, and Binaural, as opposed to their more commercial works such as Ten, Vs, Yield, Avocado, and Backspacer.  I'm someone who thought PJ were always better when they were experimenting, especially with dark textures and haunting melodies and lyrics.  Lightning Bolt delivers with this.<br /><br />I'm not a \\"review\\" guy, I don't want to do a break down of every song.  But I do think Lightning Bolt is Pearl Jam's best album in 13 years.... I'm impressed and pleased by it.  There will always be PJ fans who want to give 5 stars to everything this band does, but I think it's healthy to maintain objective viewpoints when reviewing music.  I definitely don't think it's a \\"masterpiece\\", or a 5 star album, but I do think it's a great album... Full of GREAT songs such as Yellow Moon, Future Days, Sirens, Pendulum (For fun, listen to the drum beat on the PJ song \\"Education\\", then listen to Pendulum), Sleeping By Myself, Infallible, and Getaway (which is a WAY better song than Mind Your Manners, and it should've been the first single).  I think some of these songs rank amongst PJ's best songs ever.<br /><br />I wish Pearl Jam would increase the frequency at which they release albums.  Waiting 4 years for every new PJ album is a little disheartening, and I would like to see them more focused on creating new albums faster... I realize they have families and other hobbies, as well as other side projects, but Lightning Bolt has got me excited again... It's made me think that it's still possible Pearl Jam's best album may be waiting ahead.  At the very least it confirms to me Pearl Jam still know how to write great songs.  Backspacer worried me, because I thought 'Force of Nature' was the only really good/great song on it...<br /> I thought Backspacer was PJ's worst album.  For Pearl Jam to come back with their best album in 13 years, has put a big smile on my face.<br /><br />Overall, Lightning Bolt absolutely proves that Pearl Jam is still one of the very best bands of our time.
0744014956|5.0|Well worth buying. I feel like I have a piece of history. it helps you out with each mission and shows you where everything is.
B00FKE3H0G|4.0|Miley has an awesome voice and she's a beautiful young woman.  She can be certain that nobody will ever see her as a Disney kid again.  That's a shame, because the Disney kid was very sweet.  I think that Miley is still probably very sweet, but definitely rebelling.  So all of that business detracts from the quality of the music, which is amazing.  Miley's voice is quite spellbinding.  I gave it four stars not because of the negative hype surrounding Miley, but because some of the songs just didn't impress me.  One last thought, no matter how well you sing it, you shouldn't sing about kids using drugs.  It does influence them.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|Keeps your interest but that is all. They kill everyone off at the drop of a hat but not our hero. Plot too unbelievable and not plausible.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Epic book.  I've read it so many times and still love it. The ending never gets old. Ever. Go percy!
B007CMD420|1.0|Kind of a hassle. They sent the wrong cd and I had to send it back. Bought it for my bf for his birthday and was bothersome that I had to send it back. Sure they pay for shipping but I dont have a printer so had to go to someone elses house to print off the return shipping label.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I am an big kindle reader.  This is my favorite book in sooo long!!!!  Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!<br /><br />Fell in love with Drew and the book kept me interested from page one to the last page.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Dr Perlmutter has clearly and convincingly explained why grains and sugars are damaging to the brain and to the body.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie and what a great story line and plot. I would recommend reading the book before the movie comes out Nov. 1st.
193700788X|5.0|love it love it loooooove it !!!<br />Such a shame  this is the last book of Sookie Stackhouse novels....... =/<br /><br />We want more Charlaine Harris!!! =] =] =]
B000FA5STS|4.0|This book's plot was the usual Baldacci twister, but its dependence on technology that is now a bit dated detracted from its development.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Love this app very fun and entertaining. But can get very hard. And you have to spend money on coins but other than that it's a good app.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I really like the legendary AEROSMITH...Some albums like PUMP, ROCKS, TOYS IN THE ATTIC and GET A GRIP are among the best HEAVY ROCK EVER!!!! But, since the JUST PUSH PLAY album, they totally lost their way.....Ok, there´s some good songs here like LEGENDARY CHILD, but ALL the songs got a POP feeling that´s not really the AEROSMITH i love.... I will always like AEROSMITH´s AMAZING past albums, but for me they ended at the great album NINE LIVES, from the distant year of 1997....Some good songs here, but A LOT of radio ballads and POP rock songs that´s not so cool!!!!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app has been such a great app for me and for my Kindle Fire HD!!! It's been a lifesaver, when my KINDLE started to act up and rebooting it wasn't working great and I found this app AND it was free too, SOLD!!! And I've been a very happy girl ever since I got it:) LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!
B00DW39B2K|1.0|one of the worst - GORY, BORING AND WITHOUT MERIT<br /><br />can't believe they made this movie. don't waste your time
B008XG1X18|5.0|i can look up anything and learn how to do it and i can learn new things all the time! im so addicted!
0470424656|4.0|This is a must-have book for wannabe bankers and it is a great supplement for a valuation course. The chapters are very organized and detailed. The book would be even better if there were more examples and perhaps a sample model. Nonetheless, the content is very good and the book is a keeper.
0143038095|5.0|The book even  though i bought it used it looked like a brand new book it had no bent pages or the corners it looked as if you bought it in a book store
B00ALGW286|5.0|For many years, the Soviet Union and Russia was a mystery hidden from the West behind the Iron Curtain. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, we got a glimpse of what life was like in Russia. Of course, most of the information came through the media, the politicians, and other filtered sources. What makes the book Moscow Dreams by Julia Gousseva so fascinating is that it offers an insider’s view of events that created the new Russia, starting with the attempted coup of 1991.<br /><br />Told from the point of view of Marina, the novel’s young protagonist, the story takes the readers through the events that shaped today’s Russia: from the opening of the first McDonald’s in Moscow to the rumbling of tanks down Moscow’s quiet streets. The story’s atmosphere is real and authentic: the author lived in Moscow at the time and experienced these events first-hand.<br /><br />This novel is an interesting take on the coming-of-age theme: as Marina is changing and maturing, so is her country. Change is a major theme of this unique novel.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Got this as I had read the Tuf stories included in the two Dreamsongs volumes.  Each of the stories in this book are self-contained, though they build on the previous stories.  Tuf's manner of speaking and occasional droll sense of humor add to the enjoyment and, though Tuf's physical description doesn't exactly match, I kept picturing Conleth Hill, who plays Lord Varys on Game of Thrones, as Tuf (the bald look with the droll delivery) with Kathy Bates as Tolly Mune.  I could see this as a cable series, with enough time to develop the characters of each story.  Also, lots of morality lessons about man's arrogance, overpopulation, religion, and, of course, 'be careful what you wish for'.  Another excellent body of work by Mr. Martin.
B009RH9FR6|1.0|When it first arrived I thought it was great.  High quality and held my Fire securely.  3 month in the case transfers it's black leather dye onto the screen and will NOT come off.  If you use a screensaver you will be replacing it every month or so.  This case seems to double the weight of the Fire. Look for an alternativecase, perhaps a case with a microfiber lining instead of the leather.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This season is too funny. The producers of this program really know how to humor the audience. I truly enjoyed it.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This case fits snugly on my Kindle Fire HD, it's nice and padded.  Well-made, as I expect from Belkin.  I use it to toss my kindle into my laptop bag, and I'm not worried about scratching or bashing it whatsoever.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Funny episodes..Truly a joy to watch with family and friends.  These guys are different and the plot is always fun. Highly recommend this.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|If you like the shorter virgin you'll love this one even better. Once I start this I couldn't stop playing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent movie, very true to the book. We really enjoyed watching it and am looking forward to the next two in the series.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|Classic 70's Peace; Love; and Rock n Roll  biker movie. Freedom of expression along with police corruption, & hippie haters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really fun to read , edge of my seat.  Love hate the main characters. HATED the ending it was a lame cop out.<br /><br />However, this was well written and true to its genre.  Pretty sure it will make a really fun movie if the wonderful surprises can remain in tact.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I remember reading this in elementary school. It was a great book then and is still just as go as ever.
0307887448|5.0|After totally enjoying this book, I bought one for my 50ish son who lived the gamer life in his teens.  And then I realized it would be appropriate for grandson currently in that stage.  And then a granddaugher's boy friend.  And then .....
B00FVS4EUI|3.0|This forum is for reviewing the show. Comments otherwise should be directed to customer service. Comments regarding opinions about The Walking Dead belong here.<br />The Walking Dead is my favorite show but I was really disappointed in the season opener. Something seems OFF....soap oper-ish or something. I mean, the opener for season 3 was THE scariest, edge-of-my-seat program ever but I didn't feel scared or thrilled during this new one...it was kind of, well, Blah. I thought after 6 months that Judith should be a LOT bigger than that baby they were holding. Oh well--'nuff said. I still love my WD but only give this episode 3 stars.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for an Eagle enthusiast and he was very impressed.  There was footage and interviews that after 30 years he had not seen before.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Clock is great. Keeps me on time. Love the feature that allows it to stay on if plugged in. Also that you can change the wake up sound.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really loved the movie and could not wait for each book that was published in this series.  Loved it!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is pure joy. I found myself laughing out loud over and over again. It is so well written in an understated way that the humor just bubbles out at unexpected times. Wish there were far more books like this. Bravo Jonas Jonasson!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an excellent product and it works very well.  It assisted a family member without access to a kindle.
B000VEA38E|5.0|Great music.  I put all the cd's into my Itunes and press play while I play The Old Republic.  One great symphony.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved the movie and could not wait to read each book that was published, which did not take long to read once I started.  Excellent!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I knew the ending of this horribad movie in the first 5 minutes. The Inception/Tron music didn't even help this movie to pretend to be a blockbuster. I didn't care about the characters whether they lived and died.  Moon is a much better movie.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I love how Stanton is able to capture each person's essence while still creating a beautifully photograph. The stories are funny and heartfelt but honest. I want to see more of his work for sure
B00007GZQZ|5.0|My wife make references to this movie in our home and we still laugh at those scenes we reference to.<br />1. The Tom Hanks laugh as he stares at the tub.<br />2. Yelling at his wife when he is stuck in the floor.<br />3. You! Wh***! is a definite classic.<br />This is by far one of the best comedies ever.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I have been a long time trekker fan from the original series to star trek enterprise. Now i did not go to the theaters to watch this because it costs too much when you factor in the popcorn and the drinks. I could not wait for this to come out on dvd so when i saw that it was available in the instant digital section i purchased that one too. It was well worth the extra money. I have watched it four times and will watch it many more times in the years to come.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The best review I can give it is, my wife who dislikes violence in movies and shows is actually a fan.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I was initially hesitant to give Mud a chance, for a variety of reasons. Matthew McConaughey on the cover, coming of age movie, this sounds lame.<br /><br />However, Mud ended up exceeding my expectations. Mud is a curious character, but not as curious or relatable as the two protagonists, Ellis and Neckbone. This movie is an adventure in storytelling, about experiencing truth in multiple ways.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|it was a good book for this reason why I love it and I loved it. It made me think like a giant.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am the first person to question the validity of books like this, but with Dr. Alexander's medical explanation of what happened to him, I have a new respect for NDEs.
1400082773|5.0|This DVD will give you answers to questions that you will not find no where else; you will understand why things are happening.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have read both books in this series and will certainly look forward to the next book of this trilogy.  I enjoy a good love story that doesn't have pages of love scenes.  A few surprises in this book held my interest and made it hard to put down.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome it's like call of duty on the kindle good graphics and fun multiplayer and guns worth $7
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Not bad for $3.99. Great album and they do deserve all the accolades they're receiving. I suggest as a must have and great &#34;kicking back&#34; music
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Into darkness takes us into a roller coaster of a ride. Amazing story telling, fantastic acting. This movie will make you a Star Trek fan. I cannot recommend this movie enough!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent product in every way.  Does all of what an app of this purpose should do and more flawlessly &amp; looks great doing it!  Well worth the small price and more.
B001VU1NJ0|4.0|This movie was a dramatic, suspenseful, and had a great twist at the end. Sean Penn was great in this movie!

B004J4WL50|5.0|Loved every word, sentence, chapter of this book. Extremely inspiring. A MUST read. It came to my life in just about the right time.
0783225482|5.0|I have been searching for this movie in stores for years. I finally purchased online and i couldnt be happier!
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I really hated this book. It was such a disappointment. I'm still not even positive what the plot was? I do agree with other readers that the imagery created through author's writing was great, but it's a book. If all I wanted to do was see a pretty picture, I'd go to a museum and stare at one for a few minutes and then move on with my life. Unfortunately, this book is like standing in front of the Mona Lisa for a week straight. Yeah, it's pretty, but you can only take in the beauty for so long before you want to rip your hair out! I just really really hated this book!
B009WUBERW|1.0|some movies are bad, but fun anyway. this one is trying to be that bad movie, so cliché it's it's OK. But it doesn't work, so it's sad bad.
0439023513|1.0|First off, I enjoyed the first two books. The second was my favorite. However the third book was horrible. I wont give away the details in case you read it, but don't keep your hopes high. It has its moments, but overall it just feels like the author became resentful of her characters and sick of writing for this last book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I could not put this book down! The energy and anticipation was similar to Gone Girl. The author moves the story along nicely with flash backs and internal monologue. The epilogue presents some tough, thought provoking questions that leave you wanting your next book club meeting asap!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have been a fan of Tesla for years. I learned much about this great man that I didn't know before. He was robbed and cheated throughout his life but he never let it stop him.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|So I put a ring on it.  Metaphorically.  Really thought it was good enough that I ended up buying it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|TFIOS is a great book to read. I was hesitant to read it at first cause of all the hype but the hype was right and well worth it. he is a great author, writes great books, so its a definite must read. the book has romance, some humor in a way, and a lot of feeling. read this book when u have the time. its an easy read as well.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond and anyone who says otherwise didn't watch these movies with an open mind (or an open heart).  I would venture to say that he is the greatest Bond in the history of the character, but everyone who agrees with me is entitled to their own opinion.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Very entertaining and informative.  I learned a lot and have already recommended this book to some friends who also run
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This mighty little gem is a cinematic masterpiece that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire 182 minutes.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|What can I say, it's Bon Jovi.... the greatest of all time... a review of mine wouldn't do it much justice... the songs are amazing. All my favourite BJ songs are on this album.. its an awesome collection of their hits.. it's a must have....
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I love the game on the phone but are you joking I cant install it because I'm out of storage? I have 3 gbs left
B001EBWITA|5.0|This was another good movie. I think Keanu did a good job. The film was suspenseful and very entertaining. Good.
B002R88G5E|5.0|A fictional story that I am sure is one that is a reflection for many afghan families that have lived through these times and lost loved ones.
1400069289|5.0|I have many deeply ingrained habits, as we all do, and this book gives great insight into why those exist and how to change them. It offers real stories of people who changed their habits to change their lives. I found this information very helpful and would recommend it to anyone who feels stuck in a habit and wants to change or at least understand why that habit exists.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|honestly a fun movie though I would be careful of who I let watch this since you see the one girls butt and everything at one point.
B007FH9GA6|1.0|Can't say why. I use a MacBook. I'm not very tech savvy but not tech stupid either. I clicked on the link and simply, nothing happened. What a shame and waste of money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ones you start reading it you can't stop<br />Now I need to read the third book right away<br />These books are meant for teenagers but at my forties I am hooked up<br />Enjoy it
B005DD7H50|5.0|One the best movies I ever seen! I recommended to watch it but at the end is really up to you if you want to fallow the message of the movie.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|How great this NEW album is! Reminds me of \\"Flaming Pie\\", but even tops that one.  And because of Amazon's Auto-Rip feature, I was able to listen to and download the entire album with digital booklet at 11:00pm last night, half a day before it hits retail stores!<br />Listened to all through headphones, and there are just some amazing tracks here. \\"On My Way To Work\\" and \\"Looking At Her\\" are first favorites, I'm sure to have more on second listen. Hear the Mark Ronson sound on a couple of tracks, big fan (check out his \\"Here Comes The Fuzz\\" cd..). NEW is genius songwriting, recording and performance that is nostalgic and completely fresh at the same time. He could play every song on the album live and they would fit right into his set. Thank you, Paul!
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Better than I expected. And my expectations were very high. Brings back memories of simpler times. Kinda sorta. It's good to be where I am now and watch this stuff on video.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Very thoughful and user friendly. Very good educational spiritual tool to help you understand the Bible. This is an excellent app.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Being the pioneers of the nu-metal genre, KORN hasn't topped themselves since 1994 when they released their iconic self-titled debut. We have, however, seen great overall albums from KORN, such as LIFE IS PEACHY and UNTOUCHABLES, and even attempts to recapture their former sound such as REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE and TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR, but none of these were as good as the self titled album. THE PARADIGM SHIFT, though, might be that album. While it's not as good as the self-titled (of course), this is the best KORN album since their debut, and it's not just because of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch's return. Nearly everything about this album is a wealthy improvement over their previous four albums, from the album production, to the guitar work (which in some tracks is reminiscent of Head's side project Love and Death, which I also recommend), to the layered electronic noises (which are actually layered, unlike on albums such as SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE and especially PATH OF TOTALITY). So far, my favorite tracks have to be LOVE AND METH (get the play on words?), PUNISHMENT TIME, PARANOID AND AROUSED, and IT'S ALL WRONG. For a definite contender of one of the best albums of 2013, I highly insist you at least take a listen.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|The author is a good writer, and I was drawn into her story, but I can't really say why. I think it was her brutal honesty. I also couldn't tell you how she &#34;found&#34; herself exactly. There wasn't a giant epiphany out there on the trail--maybe there were lots of small ones. For me there was a minor irritation that her trek took place so long ago.<br /><br />But, all that said, I would have given it 4 stars were it not for the gut-wrenching animal-cruelty shared at the book's halfway mark. In this her brutal honesty wasn't wanted. I had to put the book down, and I didn't think I was ever going to pick it back up again. After that scene, I really didn't like the author. I was mad at her. Not just for the cruelty but for her having shared it. However, I'm one of those people who can't leave things unfinished--particularly books--so I went back to it, and nothing of that nature ever came up again.<br /><br />After I learned about the animal cruelty, it occurred to me that perhaps THIS event, this horrid and cruel mistake, was the real reason the author reached out to drugs, and not the death of her mother. (The drug use and her mother's death aren't spoilers; she deals with those early on in the story.)
B00BP0OL1S|5.0|What a great book!  A very nice look into the personalities and leadership skills of our Presidents and their special relationships due to an incredible unique something in common.  A must for American history buffs!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy watching period pieces and Downton Abbey is quite interesting. A friend turned me on to it after the first season. I was able to catch up on the seasons on Netflix. Then, I couldn't find seasons three. Finally signed up for Amazon Prime and was able to see the entire season three. Now just waiting for season four!
0979019710|5.0|This book is a MUST read! Out of all the personal development books out there, The Miracle Morning ranks among my top 5 favorites. Hal Elrod's style of writing is such that its almost as if you're receiving sage advice from a  personal friend. Every action you need to take to achieve success is clearly laid out with options to customize if you so choose. For anyone looking to take their business, their relationships, their health, or their life in general to the next level, The Miracle Morning is the book that will get you there.
0446310786|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Read it in high school but really didn't know how great it was until I read it again. I recommend reading this at least once in your life.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|So happy it came out for kindle. A friend played it on his phone and got me hooked I loved reloaded and I love this game.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This was just a delightful book.  I finished it in two sittings and could have read all night.  The protagonist was so aware of not fitting in, one felt a little guilty having so much fun reading his story.  This is what he learned (and I learned):  &#34;I need not be visibly odd.  I could engage in the protocols that others followed and move undetected among them.  And how could I be sure that other people were not doing the same - playing the game to be accepted but suspecting all the time that they were different?&#34;  Very wise man, Don Tillman!  This is Simsion's first book.  Hopefully, he is busy working on the second!
B00000G3PA|5.0|It's a great movie that has made some of those best selling list of movies. When the time comes it will become a classic too.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you have the latest equipment, it might be easy to set up. I had to hire a tech to set up mine and he did not have an easy time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wanted to watch all episodes at once  captivating awesome I love it and would watch again.  The best ever
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Another great adventure with Professor Robert Langdon!  Dan Brown throws Robert and his protagonists into one pit of snakes after another and the action doesn't stop or give you a chance to breathe.  I'm hooked on Mr. Brown's brand of suspenseful adventure and his intriguing subjects.  The villain is a worthy antagonist, diabolical, driven, and vengeful.  I learn a lot from reading his books.  In this tale, I learned things about our country's capitol that I never knew, rather clandestine information, but more general as well.  After reading about the capitol, I want to visit and see for myself, although I checked a fair number of subjects presented in the book on the Internet.  The only thing I'd add to his book is a map of Washington, D.C.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Our family loves this movie! Our kids are 4, 8, and 10. I definitely recommend this selection for family movie night!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|awesome book lots of twists. can't wait to star the next one.<br />Marissa Meyer did an awesome job with the characters and her descriptions
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Sometimes we glamorize US History.  This book showed the reality that our country was built on slave labor.  It showed the male dominated society as women had so very limited options too.  Also explored the complicated relationship between master and owner with the result of many mixed families who didn't share the same opportunities.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and character development.  I liked the interaction of characters and how they evolved and became friends.
1476727910|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much because the premise was unusual - a basically well-meaning alien coming to earth to assisinate a scientist - but eventually falling in love with a human and embracing human culture - all seen through the eyes of the alien.
B00321GTJU|5.0|Used it to show the jungle biome to my class. They were thoroughly engrossed which is really impressive for them.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Wonderful script and strong acting throughout. Jennifer Lawrence, of course, won an Oscar for the role, but Bradley Cooper, Riobert De Niro and Jacki Weaver all did outstanding jwork. Jacki Weaver's portrayal of the mother was very nuanced - I felt that she should have won for Best Supporting Actress.<br /><br />It is unusual to have a romatic comedy with such strong underlying dramatic themes - emotional/mental illness, letting go, redemptive relationships - but this movie embraces all of that with a strong sense of humor and empathy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!!  I've got the whole family playing!!! It's a BINGO hall in your very own home...fun fun fun!
B008JFUO72|2.0|I really thought this would be exciting especially since everyone is into superhero movies now, but this way lame. I'm so glad I did not pay movie theater prices for my family to go see this. I would have flipped out and asked for my money back. My kids who LOVE Iron Man were so bored with this DVD and completely bummed.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Really happy with the whole process here. It arrive quickly and was just what I ordered. I was really anxious to watch this movie and now have it available any time I wish.
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|This book is a life changer! I will be reading it again and again!! I am so joyful that I have read this book!!
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Simply Wonderful !!! Really simple and intuitive , perfect for daily using ; coulb be more awesome only if they will  release new filters .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This thing is always improving its self and is the new temple run! Every month or so it goes to a different part of the world, and it is always so awesome! Please get!
1936891026|1.0|I kept trying to push through this book, hoping to find some nugget of wisdom, but I was terribly disappointed. I finally had to stop because I couldn't stand another minute of his ridiculous metaphors and anecdotes. I can appreciate passionate writing, but he sounds as if he doesn't have a clue where he's going with this book, and just yells and fusses in hopes that you won't notice. He all but shrugs away the legitimate mental health issues such as depression and ADHD as a product of an unfulfilled creative spirit, which is a ridiculous and flat-out wrong \\"diagnosis\\".  He also suggests that Hitler started World War II because he didn't get into art school, which is a gross and disturbing oversimplification of a complex world event. Overall, a ridiculous, pointless, and inane read.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|it has some really good guns  the guns realistic the effects seem real i love it it has really great wepons like the stenmark or thompson.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i downloaded this app when i got kindle.  The pics look great! Reading on Kindle is also great. Facebook is great app.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik worked perfectly fine untill about two days ago I logged out and  now, it won't let me log back in! I read the other comments and I tremendously agree. This problem is VERY annoying, PLEASE FIX IT  AMAZON!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|i completed this app on my phone but on the kindle really enjoying it.  Great way to pass time! You will enjoy it on moblie or tablet.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Cool! And, it's free! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A must have One! Tons of features and lots of fun! O La La
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of their absolute best and is a must have for anyone who follows their music. All time favorite!
B00AR5BR8C|4.0|It was a cute movie.  From my understanding, it's based on true events.  It's just nice to be able to sit down with the family and watch a movie together that has substance.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|I was very impressed by the visual effects of this movie, and would recommend it for anyone who likes action comedy movies.  I'd also recommend seeing it on blue ray 1080 @ 120hz cause it will blow your mind!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Lag from browser to TV stream (obv except netflix and youtube). Not an internet connection problem<br /><br />BUT, its only 35 bucks
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Most of my favorites are in this album. I love it and listen daily. Try it, you'll like it too. .
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Giving the original \\"Star Trek\\" a rating with one to five stars is sort of like reviewing Shakespeare. The television series changed science fiction forever, made a pop culture impact worldwide, predicted the future, and kicked off a franchise that is still making billions of dollars today. Yes, the show is schlocky, yes the effects are bad, yes the acting is overwrought, yes some of the plots are cliche (and probably were 40 years ago). But we love it anyhow.<br /><br />The only reason I'm subtracting one star from what would otherwise be a perfect five out of five is this: In this set of recordings, someone felt the need to go back and redo many of the visual effects with mediocre CGI. The original bad effects are part of the appeal of the series. The new bad effects look just as dated, but dated to 2006 instead of 1966. Today, in 2013, they already look bad and out of place. I guess some executive figured if George Lucas can do it to \\"Star Wars\\" then they might as well do the same to \\"Star Trek.\\" Personally, I'd rather have the original bad effects. Nobody's \\"updating\\" the dialogue or hokey costumes, so why update the shots of the Enterprise circling the planet below?<br /><br />(By the way, unlike in the JJ Abrams \\"reboots\\" any lens flares you see in these episodes are real authentic non-simulated happy accidents.)
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Over all good for a free game. Some of the puzzles are a little small on my Kindle screen but so far that's my only complaint.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for the kindle! If you are reading any book you should be reading the Good Book. So it makes perfect sense that this app is available on the Kindle.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It is okay but also it is kinda hard to understand if when you are only ten!!! My favorite quote was :<br />&#34;Oh no, oh no, I'm gonna die! Ender squished a caterpillar and now he's gonna squish me!&#34;
1594744769|5.0|A mesmerizing engrossing story.  Enter a world full of wonderful characters possessing strange gifts, never growing older, protected and cared for by special guardians.  Abe shared the adventures of his youth with his grandson, Jacob.  Jacob came to disbelieve his grandfather's stories as well as the amazing photographs of the children who were Abe's friends.  However, when Abe is brutally murdered, Jacob cannot doubt the creature he saw with his very own eyes.  Join Jacob on his mission to uncover the truth about the \\"island\\" and its strange inhabitants.  The journey will be an unforgettable one.[[ASIN:1594746036 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|implausiblely ridiculous, but linked to reality enough to keep watching.  Plot threads draw you in for more. Visually sensational and never a dull moment.  Love the &#34;latiny&#34; dialogue
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has found a way to put music back into episode television. The formula is simple, take great songs and let talented people sing them.
B005PK56TA|5.0|All it took was one episode of season 1 and I was hooked. Very scary and very entertaining! Must watch!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|My kindle fire is a good one, but it handled the basic facebook app much better than the full face book. I can be typing something & suddenly I'm back to the home screen. I'm continuing to use the basic facebook app until I see or hear this has improved.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I had been wanting to watch this show since I saw info about it at last years ComicCon. When I saw that I could order it on Amazon streaming I did, I think I watched season 1 3 times back to back. This is my new standard for TV shows. It's so good i can't believe it's not on SyFy. Whoever did the casting for this show should win an award! Stephen Amell is a brilliant actor! He does not just read a script he acts with his whole body, his facial and eye expressions are remarkable, as are Emily Bett Richards!!
B005MIPC4O|5.0|If you are a fan of Beethoven's symphonies in their natural orchestral settings, then you will be amazed at the interpretations and performances by Cyprien Katsaris of the Franz Liszt versions.  That the complexities of the Beethoven orchestral works can be expressed by two hands at a piano is simply amazing.  The beauty is still there, when it calls for it, like in the 6th and 7th symphonies, and the virtuosity needed for the 9th symphony will leave you breathless.  And to have it all recorded by a single performer gives it a cohesion that makes it all work.  This may not only become your favorite way to hear the Beethoven symphonies, this may also become your favorite piano works.  And Cyprien Katsaris is as close as we're going to come to the reincarnation of the performing Franz Liszt as we're likely to see.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is Fun and flirty. This is the perfect light read!! Although the story progresses slowly at first, you will find yourself captivated with the lives of Megan and Connor. Their witty banter and his smooth sexy way of dealing with everything brings you in and makes you want more. Despite the obvious direction of the story the connection between Connor and Megan will have you at the edge of your seat and keep you wanting more. You will see them both grow and sympathize with Megan throughout the book while inevitably falling in love with all things Connor. Whether its a road trip, a book to read at the pool, or just something light to cozy up and read Waking Up Married is the book for you!
B00867HDTA|5.0|Its a great time killer and keeps you into it. I play it whenever i get bored. full marks to the developer
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A lil kid like but still fun. It is cute, silly, colorful, and some of the levels can be challenging.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|This album has a really nice sound to it. The are a great group, I would reccomend it highly also.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the whole series.  What a cliffhanger of an ending!  don't know what's going to happen this season... lokking forward to it.
0987300911|5.0|It's really wunderful book for the ilets test, help me in listening,reading,writing,speaking I hope everyone who have ilets test get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun and I would wish everyone can play I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|it wont download for me but I loved deer hunter reloaded so I'm sure its good but 2 stars for me because of that reason of what I said
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game tons of fun and sure can't beat the price!!! These little guys really crack me up can't help but giggle along with them.
B0062NAX1U|2.0|I loved the movie.  It is a must see for all.  I shared it with my women's ministry and it was enjoyed by all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|No words to describe the feeling when I use it. I just love it so very much!!!!!! Lots of ideas from crafting to bucket lists to fave spaces and places. Just so much fun!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not WIRELESS HDMI, you can only stream apps, which limits the use. Everything is also still in beta including most importantly Chrome browser.<br />Rumors say soon we should be able to stream our whole screen instead of just an app.<br /><br />Speed is okay, slightly lag input as expected. Uses Router's Wifi network to connect and issue commands. Big problem is it only accepts 2.4GHz, no 5GHz. Fortunately my Asus AC66U dual band lets me sign onto 5GHz on phone, and control the Chromecast on the 2.4GHz signal.<br /><br />P.S. You still have to switch your TV's input every time so you can't ditch the remote completely, not quite a Smart TV alike, but neither the price.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|I chose it not just because I love Johnny depp but because it was really good. The characters were chosen really well
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not as good as the original.  Not as shocking or sometimes disturbing as the sequel.  I miss not seeing Mike Tyson in this episode.  Fitting ending for the trilogy, but three of the Wolf pack members seem to be going through the motions to get through the story .  The ending after the credits left it open for a part 4.  Hopefully they will leave it as is and retire the Wolf pack.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I have ordered products for almost every week since my first purchace. I must admit I am very pleased with Amazon. I will continue to spread the great news.
1476733953|5.0|This is a long overdue review for a book that I think is excellent in all respects, from the well-rounded character development to the original story line. I had a hard time putting it down when I was reading it, often reading way past my &#34;bedtime&#34;! I am a huge fan of science fiction and this is probably one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It instantly drew me in and there were constant twists and turns in the plot that kept me engaged. I really enjoy being &#34;thrown in&#34; to a story and discovering and exploring new things with the characters instead of having a more omniscient view of the story. It adds mystery and interest since you never know what might be revealed next.<br /><br />I have read all the books in the Wool series (including Shift and Dust) and I have to say that I cannot wait to read more of Howey's work.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|nice alarm click. easy to read. love the weather feature and the display look to it.  easy to set up.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Great album from a great band. Glad that Brian Welch is back and the album couldn't be any better. Perfect!
140006922X|5.0|You could write a book about what I did not know about the world Jesus grew up in - and this is the book. The first chapter or two was a little slow for me - didn't care much about the other messiahs of the day - but the chapters running parallel to the Gospels were fascinating.
1589949811|5.0|Let me start by saying, the art to this game is completely phenomenal. Simply put, the art is some of the best in all of gaming... bar none! Also, the cards are of nice stock and have a nice texture to them.<br /><br />The game play is solid. Although most people complain about how hard the rules are, my house rules give me a chance to win. Yeah, the rules are THAT difficult, so beware, the core rules could frustrate you.<br /><br />LotR-CCG is not a deck building game or a collectible card game either, instead it uses cards like a Dungeon Master and events and enemies pop up and how your heroes deal with... that is up to you. It feels like a dungeon crawler to me sometimes or a 1-2 man massively simplified D&D game (without the character customization). I have now owned this game almost two years now, and it is a bit stale for me. Not because it's a bad game, simply I have played it to death. I can now say after solid multiple plays, there are a few things missing (or should I say, some things that could be better).<br /><br />1. It needs more character customization. There needs to be more getting rings, new swords or \\"loot\\" (like in the World of Warcraft video game). Also every kill, successful action or successful mission should give your character(s) benefits. There really aren't any significant rewards for success (other than the \\"end game\\" win) and no \\"in-game-development\\".<br /><br />2. I would like a actual board to put the cards on as well, and with this game being a bit more expensive than it needs to be, (especially with the majority of components being cards) they should of included other components like a board.<br /><br />3. I don't always feel like I am \\"in a location\\" as the cards suggest, and characters do odd things sometimes. Keep in mind, the Lord of the Rings world is a very real one to many of it's literary audiences, and I don't FEEL that often in the game. Like so many games, you sometimes ask yourself, \\"would Frodo do this?\\" or... \\"Legolas is doing what?\\"<br /><br />4. The eye timer component is meant to speed up the game so the scenario doesn't last all day, but this is a bit frustrating and you can lose a scenario due to that component. I would of preferred the scenario telling the player, \\"you have to hurry and in two rounds you must free the Hobbits before they die\\"... some other way of speeding things up and limiting you that make more sense. I simply do not care for the game's \\"Threat level\\".<br /><br />5. Some scenarios like \\"The Lurker in the Water\\" is too short (and like two pages in the LotR novels). These scenarios need to be double the length much like Pathfinder's Adventure Card Game. The scenarios don't seem to have as much depth, richness or flavor as there should be. For example, when you get to a location, why could you not \\"get information from a town's farmer\\"? (or other NPC's that would give more depth and theme). With the rich and deep world that Tolkien has created, you'd think the creators of this game would of delved into it a bit more.<br /><br />6. Like other reviewers have eluded to, the very nature of Fantasy Flight's Living Card System is different than a collectible card game. It is NOT like Magic the Gathering, but you can sink lots of money into it's many many expansion packs. But it does feel like they are milking your pocket book dry. So buyer beware of the many dollars you can and probably will sink into this game (even though the base game is very playable \\"as-is\\"... and without expansions).<br /><br />With all these criticisms, Lord of the Rings Living Card game is fun and it's a solid game with amazing illustrations and quality components. Just keep in mind, like any game, it has short-comings and ultimately you'll probably be buying more than the base game and much poorer than you expected to be.<br /><br />Have a great day and happy gaming!is doing what?\\"<br /><br />4.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did not think I would enjoy this series as much as I am.  Some of the dry British humor is very funny!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. Even more so than we thought we would. It was tense and exciting and very overall enjoyable.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I've received this item, yet I still do not have my iPhone 5S -- it's being shipped. I tried this on my friends phone that is a 5 and it fits like a glove!  Awesome product!!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|If you're a casual Star Trek watcher, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you're a die hard fan who feels that altering any previously told story within Star Trek lore is strictly taboo, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Besides that, the quality of this blu-ray presentation is simply outstanding.  The signature Abrams lens flare notwithstanding, I found the video transfer to be near flawless. The audio is spectacular and I had none of the audio troubles you may have read about elsewhere on the internet.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I probably would not watch this a second time, but it was cheap and a good 3-d flick.  Very artistic presentation reminiscent of a Target ad  under psychedelic drugs.  Story equally absurd, but fun.  This is an experience and do not take your brain to this movie,
B003G4W49C|5.0|If only one person reads this I'm truly touched by what I have read to think that one person, a child, could have such empathy for an enemy. I can't stop crying and bemoaning the beautiful ending, because it was tragic and sad yet oh so beautiful. The story touches you in many ways and I can only hope that someone could be as touched as I am...<br /><br />Who is to say what any one would have done if place in Enders situation. Forced from what he knows and loathes, to be placed in a situation where most normal people would break. As I was reading I sympathized to a degree with such a young child to place in such a situation and I still feel that sympathy because, never to the degree that Ender, want to left alone. To be without constraints free of society's needs. But that could also be me being self important.<br /><br />Bitter and beautiful as the tale is of Ender it tells of human empathy, apathy, and our need to survive no matter the cost. Even morals stand to matter little when placed in a situation of life in death.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Excellent documentation of the cave, the art and the background history.  I did not fully appreciate this movie till I saw and payed for my extended family to go see a special exhibit about another nearby cave at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois for a hefty fee.  This film cost less than the price of the museum ticket and every aspect of the exhibit was vastly overshadowed in quality, information and beauty of the film.<br /><br />i am a caver and my four daughters, all now grown, were all artists to one degree or another, so this film has special interest for me.  As a cave film it is a bit slow, but my artists rave about the art.<br /><br />The 3-D is very effective for the cave scenes, but is hit and mis for the outside scenes.  Color and sound is excellent,
0744014956|5.0|The product is exactaly what I have expected! I strongly recommend this product for everybody that likes GTA V! good!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|As a sci-fi  fan, one of the best shows to watch. It's often paranormal or urban legend meets science, and it entertains with each bizarre episode.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I was introduced to DT through \\"That Metal Show\\" a few years ago (very late to the party). I absolutely love, this album! It rocks me; slows down; takes me on long journeys, much like other music I prefer (King Crimson, Rush, Queensryche, ELP, Pink Floyd, etc..), and allows me to enjoy some speedy riffs, and keyboards, without taking me into Genres that I don't care for (Thrash).<br /><br />Hard to believe that a kid that grew up on Kiss, REO, Styx, and other Midwestern-fare, would be loving and appreciating Dream Theater, MORE THAN ALL BANDS. PERIOD!<br /><br />Buy the album. Enjoy!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I absolutely love this app but it won't let me be  on it I've had it for a while and this happened yesterday please fix
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely a page turner, in more ways than one ;) ....once I picked up this book it was hard to put down..I ended up reading the whole series in a week and still found myself wanting more :)
B007PS0DTI|4.0|Entertaining, action filled movie! I loved the first one, and this one came close in quality. Wonder if they'll do anymore?
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Quality sci fi. We love the unique rugged individuals and their teamwork. You can watch these over and over. Wish there were more.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I like the idea of hidden or alternate historical stories.  Rollins stories get a little carried away with extreme action, characters getting killed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a device!  Seamlessly casting from all of my device at home and in HD too... Love it wouldn't go back to apple tv for sur
B000002LAC|2.0|I would not recommend this CD. Trio II was far superior in every way.  A purchased it without listening to it for a friend's birthday based on my love of Trio II and was so disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Its like having your own trainer. I hate working out , but was able to dedicate the small amount of time required. She really works you out
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This CD is her best - it is so poignant and easy to listen to [over and over].  ALL I INTENDED TO BE says it all. I have given this CD to friends because it is so well engineered and such a perfect reflection of Ms. Harris and her talent.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|In one word, Masterpiece. Martin Scorsese hit a bulls-eye on every point in this film. This is no mere movie, this enters onto film status. Fantastic story, every character is well developed as humans and psychos. Perfect at every scene. One of my all time favorites, behind Inherit the Wind, Tombstone, Field of Dreams, African Queen, and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.
B001VFTYWI|3.0|did not like the language and nasty details, why be so explicit.  found I was skipping pages.  I am not a writer hard to write reviews.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|This movie was very cute- thanks to Mila Kunis. I wasn't a fan of Justin Timberlake's acting (but then, I've never been so my opinion is biased). It was cute and quirky. I enjoyed it and it's something I will watch every once a while, but it's not added to my favorite movie pile.
0307949508|5.0|These are excellent stories. Totally got into the characters and the technical aspects of the story. Book is not only entertaining but educational. I guarantee that once you read the first book you will want to read the trilogy.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Another zombie movie, we need a new genre.  Brad Pitt was good, plot was so so, action was predictable.  Somehow it ends up being about family rather than saving the world!
1250038820|5.0|But, then, I didn't expect that I would have any other reaction. I ordered four, as a matter of fact. One for a friend who is planning to move here, one for my 14-year old goddaughter in Germany, one for my dad, who is sad I like it here (with the comment ... and this is why I like living here) and one for myself. I actually think I will order another for the reception area of the company I work at. So overdue, this look at NY that embraces all its humans in all their individuality. And it's a truly aesthetically beautiful book, too!
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I purchased this mic to use with my DSLR, we shoot videos and this mic will pick up everything. It is good for outdoor recording of nature or parties where you want to pick up on the audience also.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|I bought this as a present for my grandaughter. The doll is in great shape and the price was right. I would recommend this doll.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I love will and his whole family. But this movie was very low budget. Most things seemed way too fake.
B006Y9BULE|4.0|Seiko has combined two of their most popular styles in a 200 meter rated quartz scuba diver/chronograph. This is a hefty watch at 43 mm. My only complaints are minor. The date window is small and hard to read and the oyster bracelet uses collars and pins.  Removing links and adjusting the size of the bracelet can be tricky if you never done it before. Overall it is a good value and a nice looker.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|While I bought this app for my children, I find I play it more than they do. I love making over the characters. So fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I do not reccomend this unless you are fine with glitches so you cant use turbo and cant jump on the beach
B008JFUOVI|5.0|The Hangover Part III (Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack) is a funny/ great movie to have in your collection. this one is funny.
B003O86MY8|5.0|David Garrett is the most fabulous musician, violinist, ever! And he is the most enjoyable &#34;eye candy&#34; to watch as he strokes the strings of his violin. No matter if he plays rock symphonies or classical pieces, they are beautiful to hear. Rock symphonies is a great collection of familiar songs given a new upbeat twist on the violin. If you like a rock beat, you will not be disappointed!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Been a fan of Korn since their debut and when I saw them at the 9:30 Club in Washington DC during that tour in the early 90s. This is another great release from Korn. Glad 'Head' is back. Just a great album nothing more I can say. If you're a Korn fan, buy it. You'll love it.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I found this version to be a bit overdone and kinda hard to watch. I kinda wanted to turn it of 10 mins into the film but I stuck to it and finished it. It was also hard to watch due to the fact that I already knew how it was going to end, =(
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I will always remember this lovely and sensitive book about a horrific time in our world's history.  Highly recommend. I will look forward to more books by this author.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|Very good movie and storyline kinda wished I imaged it up myself. Can't say it was that scary, but their were a few things in the movie that kinda sent a shiver down my spine.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Kept you wondering about the character connections. Enjoyed the challenge of trying to figure this out. Loved the mind games.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great continuation of Eva and Gideon. Will be looking forward to finding out what things are to come for all in the story.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Torn by my moral compass -<br />I really enjoyed book 3 and was pleasantly suprised at the end to learn there will be a book 4. Necessary? Perhaps not, but exciting to see their story continue.<br />I struggled in the first few chapters, when realisation is brought to light. The way the heroin comes to terms woth the twist is not how I would personally conclude. However, I still really enjoyed the read and look am now waiting impatiently for the next installment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the entire trilogy a number of times. Exquisitely written. Captivating, page after page. I recommend this book to all who have not read it.
B00FHNBDC4|3.0|It is always good to hear a new album by Amos. I tend to like a lot of his stuff, but he went back to some of the twangy western folk stuff. There are some good songs but all in all, better off just downloading a few songs.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book had me entertained from page one. I loved the old pictures, although I found that they did not add to the story. The fantasy world that is created by the author is believable.<br />I used a tablet to read this book which enabled me to read the messages, although it did not help much with the story, the photographs and messages, just added little quirks to the book. I got the impression that the story was written after seeing the photographs.<br />I loved the book but I was disappointed with the ending.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Have been playing this game since August and have not had to pay a thing. Wish there was a way to purchase more time with the money earned in the game, like you purchase talismans.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a movie any fan of anime/Kaiju or all things fun would enjoy. Great action, good acting and a decent story all mix to make Pacific Rim. Grew up watching Godzilla/Anime and this is everything I wanted in a Man vs Kaiju movie. It may not have done great at the U.S Box Office (but that's because we like the same old crap every year) but it did great in areas where people were sick of superhero romantic comedies. This movie gives me faith in next years Godzilla 2014.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best quote from the book &#34;It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but don't give it the power to do its killing.&#34;<br /> - Augustus Waters

B008YW5RH2|5.0|Sweet and simple. Kind of fast paced, but you'll get the hang of it. Its cool if you kind of like tennis.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works just like it says. Easy to set up. I would recommend this product to anyone that has kids. It is also a great gift for someone that is an electronics fanatic.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is hilarious. The music is perfect for this game as well, kind of laid back and casual. And once you unlike the video you'll<br />&#34;set fire to your hair, and poke a stick at a grizzly bear&#34;.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|best iron man movie of the three that were made. the first movie was good. the second was average, but the third was the best. great storyline, great plot.

0321637739|5.0|Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (APUE) has long been a standard reference for those seeking to learn about systems programming in the UNIX environment.  I was recently provided a review copy of the latest edition, but I have long been familiar with the book.<br /><br />Don't let the &#34;UNIX&#34; in the title fool you, the examples provided are applicable to the following covered platforms: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and Apple Mac OS X.  The concepts taught are going to be useful for many (if not all) modern operating systems.  The fact that this is now in its third edition is a testament to the quality of the material and the authors' writing style.  Whether you are learning these concepts for the first time, or just want a trustworthy reference, APUE 3rd Edition will be very useful.  Look at other reviews and you will see words like &#34;classic&#34;, &#34;bible&#34;, and &#34;indispensable&#34;.  There is a well earned reason for this, and this book deserves your consideration if you have any interest at all in the subject matter.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like it a lot but the fact that it takes too long to restart/ try again mode makes me not like the game.  it's very cute but should be easier to start over.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is phenomenal.  It's a fitting continuation of the Shining.  I'm already thinking of what the movie will be like.  too bad Kubrick isn't around .....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is one of those little gadgets that are super easy to setup, does just one thing and does it well. And on top of it, it's cheap.<br /><br />The only problem is that the number of applications supporting the still-in-beta Cast SDK is VERY lacking (blame Google!), you have YouTube, you have Netflix, Hulu, Google Play, and that's it. And you should consider that the only &#34;universal&#34; service among those is YouTube. All the others have their own restrictions in terms of geographic availability.<br /><br />Also, the platform is restricted to Android, iOS and the Chrome browser (with some issues).<br /><br />As my HDTV doesn't support YouTube nor Netflix natively, and I already owned a couple of Android devices, the Chromecast turned to be the best alternative, considering size, price and features.<br /><br />The &#34;Cast Tab&#34; in the Chrome browser feels extremely &#34;beta&#34; (if not &#34;alpha&#34;) quality, and you really need a powerful PC or laptop and a very good wifi network if you want to make anything mildly useful with it.<br /><br />So, if considering its many restrictions it fits your bill, then it's almost perfect. If not, you'll be wasting your money.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I was having battery problems with the battery status not showing and assuming it was LOW. I replaced the battery and had the same problem. I discovered on my ASUS when I used a USB '2.0' hub everything worked fine including all the headphone buttons such as volume, next song, etc,' When On a USB '3.0' hub the phones 'audio' worked both wired and wireless but NOT the battery indicator or the volume roller or next song.<br /><br />I never tried it on a USB 3.0 jack on the computer as everything I have is run through two hubs, one a USB 2.0 connected to USB 2.0 on the computer and the other a USB 3.0 connected to a USB 3.0 port on the computer.  The erratic behavior was me for various switching the headphones USB hubs. Now that is running on a USB 2.0 hub everything works including all the buttons switches, charging and battery status.  Would it work on 3.o on the computer? I don't know but moving back to the 2.0 fixed my problems.<br /><br />Too bad I threw away the original battery as it was dated this year and just wasn't registering properly. I can't take credit, I read that keyboards, headsets, mouse, pointers, etc 'MAY NOT' work on a USB hub if they were were designed for 2.0.<br /><br />Live and learn.<br /><br />Been using this for several Months now. I still love the headset as it provides a deep richness to music and videos and the voice changer is cute on Skype. Now I have all my buttons back.<br /><br />I highly recommend it but if it only 'partially' works on USB 3.0 switch over to USB 2.0. As I said I did NOT try USB 3.0 directly on the computer (no hub), it may work tat way for you.<br /><br />Bottom line works fine on a USB 2.0 hub.<br />Only the sound works on a USB 3.0 hub<br /><br />Live and learn. So much for backward compatibility.<br />Hope you find my 'adventure' of help.

B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Fascinating story.  I looked it up and these people are based on real characters.  There isn't a written record of this era, so much like &#34;Braveheart&#34;, much of this &#34;history&#34; is oral and passed down through generations, so not sure how much is accurate.  Some of the information is NOT accurate, however it is entertaining.  The intelligent watcher just gets curious about the reality of these times and do some research.  I love it!

So, to Elizabeth: thank you for such a delightful story. I couldn't stop until I finished the book... it just bothered me that she didn't \\"LEAN IN\\" and published her theory :) How many more women in science would be by now... but that was another fact...
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book inspired me for starting a new business, no matter if this remains small or grows in the future, the important thing is you can do what you love and what you want, also it shows good tips and recomendations for this process.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|It was really great! I think the best part is when the giant is slayed by Jack. I think it adds a lot of excitement to an old story.<br />Bea
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|Shot on 70mm, this is one to watch on blu-ray if possible. Incredible scenes from all over the world shot from a unique perspective. It has no words, but it says a lot.
B002APU580|5.0|The cinematography, the dialogue, the plot - as a Pride and Prejudice fan, this is the movie I watch when I need a quick fix.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|It gives a certain number of tokens to start off with, but requires you to buy more to continue playing? The ads are terrible too, clunky and laggy. Not worth it, really.<br /><br />A shame, really because the game itself is fun.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|If you are reading the reviews then that tells me you aren't really sure about this purchase. Do yourself a favor and just buy this. Worse case you end up not liking the movie (highly unlikely) and then you can sell it to your local Browncoat. Oh... but watch the series first.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|Low replay value, not really challenging, and just not all the much fun.  Doing the same 5 tasks just slightly faster isnt entertaining to me.

B00ADQPB50|3.0|This season was disappointing because there wasn't really a connecting thread to all of the madness.  It felt like disconnected episodes of b-horror rated scripts without follow-up to an overall connection.  Each episode could have been scripted as a short horror movie with lots of gore and slasher scenarios.  Slasher movies are rarely smart; someone in the shadows hacking away, lots of blood and how many times have we seen that repeat in lieu of something quite more intelligent.  What made the first season incredibly attractive was the lack of gore but the suggestion of something quite unsettling about the visual or the dialogue occurring.  This season was highly exaggerated and I felt disgusted more times than horrified which makes for a disappointing aspect of the horror genre.  So the only saving grace for me and hence why I gave it 3 stars was Jessica Lange whose performance  did not waver from delivering a first class act no matter what the circumstances.  She basically grounded the season because otherwise it would have been simply annoying.  I don't feel optimistic now about Season 3.
076535618X|5.0|Great book. Very imaginative. I also had a chance to meet the author a few months ago and he is awesome! Very laid back and entertaining.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|So this title is the caption of a photo of a lovely woman sketching in the park.  Being self conscious on occasion, as one is, I had sort of planned my review as I was reading this book.  I would choose my favorite two or three and do a vignette.  Now this is impossible, because when I leaf through the pages, I find ten more favorites.  And retrieving the very best one snarls me in twenty more.<br /><br />This photographer set out to define the city in pictures of its occupants in all their diversity and through the changing urban landscape of New York City.  He has succeeded.  I think he has.  It has changed that last bit of my perception of a cruel soulless city into a montage of people.<br /><br />When I was a child I had a book of pictures, not published for children, but portraying a family as it understood itself, and I looked it over often.  Not since then have I been moved by photography to that degree.  The neat thing Isis that it is on my phone and my kindle.  I can thumb one over during the day when I forget to see people and not crowds or annoyances.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very fun game. I started playing and was hooked. The story is good and it is challenging enough but not too hard. My children like to play as well.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|I just do not like this book short listed for the Booker prize.  I found the astrological device to be precious, and I do not enjoy precious.  The beautiful prose felt pretentious. I hated each chapter being half the length if the one before.  I hate the idea of the author counting her words.  The chapter introductions were nerve wracking.  The intricate character word portraits dragged horribly.<br /><br />BUT the plot is luscious in its intricate folding and re-folding.  The nesting views of varying dominant characters serve as a fascinating way to advance the plot.  The setting in a gold mining town in New Zealand in the days of messenger ships and days in transit could not be more fascinating.<br /><br />Still and all, I do not like the literary rave of the year.  It is ok, but not good.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this is a simple and entertaining game (note to developers.... that is what a game should be: FUN)<br />I particularly like how the dev decided to handle transactions. When you go to the store you can buy with in game coins. or go to the end of the menu, and when you get there a message pops saying you are about to enter the paid portion of the store and any purchase will be charged.<br />See: transparency on transactions, fun game, light content... this is how you develop an app

B000LXQVA4|5.0|I carefully considered the options. I went back and forth between brands. Will I choose the right one?Will she like it? Will it sit unused?? I narrowed it down to Fisher-Price. Then the choice was which one. I went back and forth, back and forth...oh, you don't know. THIS was a BIG deal. I read the reviews. I re-read the reviews.  I finally decided on the Rainforest Jumperoo.  It arrived.  Her mom unpacked it. She watched intently.  She was placed in it. Not sure what to think. She looked left. Then right. Then left. The bouncing began. It continued for 20 minutes! The butterfly was mauled and drooled on. Nothing was safe! YES....SWOOSH....SCORED!!  Nothing but net!!  I did great.  She loves it.  The sounds, the spins, the adventures.  Gramme gets an A+.  Two days ago, she played for 45 minutes bouncing up and down. When she finished.....she stopped and tilted her head to one side and fell asleep. Now, that is a great toy!
B006CHML4I|4.0|The watch is on the small side but  have narrow wrist so it's no problem. It's not too thick so it fits well under sport shirt sleeve. Needs to be worn daily otherwise the power runs out.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Captivating book. Needless to say, masterfully written storyline with well fleshed out charactertsaiions that seem familiar, like people you know, or alternately hope you never meet. I was struck by King's sensitivity regarding the True Knot - the antagonists of the story. Whereas it would be impossible for anyone, except a sociopath, to accept preying upon children as acceptable, King tries to associate their need to kill with survival, which includes the necessity of 'consuming' the essence of children with the shining. He gave the antagonists a culture and closeness that was caring of each other - something most authors would be nervous to try for fear it would diminish their roles as the bad guys. King allowed them their tribal cohesiveness, but managed to keep the line firmly drawn between good vs. evil.  The book was not as frightening as The Shining, which is no bad thing as far as I'm concerned as horror stories tend to leave me feeling uneasy and unsure if I have really enjoyed the read. It was nice learning how Danny and his mother fared after the horrors they'd faced in The Shining. I also felt King's sensitive handling of the AA program was very good and highlighted the multifaceted issues of families caught in the cycle of substance abuse. Overall the book was enjoyable and I found myself wishing I had more, which is a personal indication that the book flowed effortlessly providing hours of captivating entertainment. Thanks, Mr. King for yet another few days escaping into your fine mind.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book and think it has been the best novel I have read in a long time!  I have recomended this book to many great readers!!!It kept my interest from start to finish.  I hated to see it end!
B000I55YV2|5.0|Every crime thriller has flaws that the film aficionado can call out, EXCEPT this one.  Is it the greatest Crime thriller ever made, no (that's an emotional choice).  But is it so well thought out, scripted, and cast, that you can not for the life of you spot one single flaw in the execution, absolutely, a resounding YES!  Here's a metaphor which might explain what I mean:  A subpar gymnast might perform an amazing routine and against all odds at the last minute pull off something wonderful which literally changes the game forever!, that's not this film.  This film is the superstar coach and the superstar gymnast getting together and performing a perfect routine that gets a perfect score and everyone claps happily because nothing less was expected.  If you can appreciate that, then you're going to add this film to your personal library as an example of how a film in this specific genre should be done.<br />Five stars for effort and execution.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Very interesting window of life in prison from the perspective of a seemingly &#34;typical&#34; citizen. The reader is always aware that Piper can never feel the hopelessness felt by her fellow inmates, but her vulnerability certainly came through. Be prepared for the commentary and statistics woven through the narrative. While informative can feel a bit preachy. I thought this was a riveting topic. I recommend this book.
B0035OC7OU|5.0|I love the character of Death.A skeleton who yields a scythe and likes curries and cats is just really funny. My mom thinks the whole thing is just mad. T he idea of being an apprentice to Death seems the kind of position that would be filled by a demon or a ghost but oh no. Pratchett instead chooses Mort a knock-kneed 26 year old boy. I just love the Discworld series and everyone should read them
B0045XGRQE|3.0|Love Robert Downey, Jr, but the movie lacked a strong story line. The end of the movie didn't feel like the end of anything, it just felt like the movie stopped.
B00338QENI|4.0|The book raises questions about the moral and ethical behavior of researchers and scientists.  It explores the scientific achievements and human consequences of medical research. There are some graphic descriptions of cancer treatments that left this reader thankful for the medical progress made since the 1950's. Leaving the question, &#34; Does the end always justify the means?&#34; still open to debate.

B00BCCEBRI|5.0|There was once before on offer a “complete” set of the RCA Julian Bream recordings: the 1993 release of a 28 CD set by BMG Classics. But it wasn’t really complete, as aficionados of Bream’s discography found to their chagrin. Additionally, the price was high and the set was soon discontinued. After Sony bought out BMG, we had to put up with Sony’s penchant for reissuing Bream recordings chopped up piecemeal. Some performances were released in compilations that made a dog’s breakfast of Bream’s thoughtfully programmed original releases. Other classic performances languished unreleased. If ever one wanted evidence that the music industry is overrun by soulless bean counters who care nothing about artistry, Sony’s treatment of the Bream discography was a good example.<br /><br />But with this new boxed set, released to coincide with Bream’s 80th birthday, Sony finally gets it right. All the RCA recordings are here, issued as they were in their original releases. Well, not quite—Sony omits some spoken comments originally on the Bream and John Williams 1979 live album. But all the music is here. Included with the 40 CDs is a hardbound book with a brief bio and detailed program listings of all the recordings. Longtime observers of Bream’s career will find little new information here, but it’s nice to have. Also included are two DVD disks that contain concert footage of Bream in his prime, a BBC documentary about Bream, and a 1972 television interview. Watching these vintage broadcasts gives a sense of the man behind the music. It’s easy to see why he was such a compelling player. One senses that the man was incapable of being bored, such is the passion he brought to everything he did.<br /><br />Bream’s career suggests that excellence is its own justification. Much of what he did had little to do with guessing what his audiences wanted and then giving it to them. Rather, he followed his own interests and did it so well that we were lured into his eclectic world. For example, mainstream audiences of the time weren’t clamoring to hear Bream play the renaissance lute. Bream did it for the simple reason that he loved the music. While it’s wrong to say he single-handedly launched an early music movement, he did bring a virtuoso’s flair to music that often suffered from amateurish performances. Bream showed that, in the right hands, lute music is more than an antiquated curiosity.<br /><br />Time has taken a toll on some of the original recordings. For example, in the 1965 recording of Bream and Peter Pears, one can hear occasional bits of distortion in the recorded sound. But these bits are mercifully short and don’t detract from the overall performances.<br /><br />Younger guitar enthusiasts weened on the homogenized sound of today’s players may at first be put off by Bream’s electric musicianship. He had his quirks. His articulation could be incisive or brittle, depending on your taste. His tone, particularly after the mid 1970s, could be thin and overly bright. To those unfamiliar with Bream and coming to this set with fresh ears, I suggest a chronological approach. Start with the earliest recordings in this set. If you’ve the perception to hear a keen mind and heart at work, you’ll be richly rewarded.<br /><br />Because of a recent injury—he was knocked to the ground by an over-enthusiastic dog—Bream has given up playing the guitar. Of this, he’s philosophical. Interviewed near his 80th birthday, he had this to say: “I’ve had a great life. I’m letting go, yes, but in a controlled way. Now it’s time to let go, to enjoy what’s left.”<br /><br />A great life, indeed, Mr. Bream. Yours is a vivid legacy for which I and many others sincerely thank you.or example, mainstream audiences of the time weren’t clamoring to hear Bream play the renaissance lute.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Down loaded this app, it was very easy to do.  Also had my daughters do it as well.  Nice idea!
140006922X|5.0|I found it interesting as well as informative. For those who believe the author is trying to \\"discredit\\" Jesus- many have not actually read the book and surely have not read the last paragraph. I found that it did nothing to lessen my faith. But rather, it helped support my longtime disdain for those who believe that every word of the Bible is pure truth, pick it apart, analyze it, and preach it as if so. This book provided me, finally, an intellectually honest view of the Bible and Jesus. I didn't want to put it down.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It's not Shakespeare, but this is an action packed movie on the level of mad max. And surprisingly, a very gorgeous movie to look at
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am not a techie, but I managed to get this to work right out of the box..... One of the FEW things that has gone well with Windows 8!<br /><br />I love using this for my Netflix. Now we need to get it to work with Amazon streaming as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game. If u have children or a niece or nephew, get this game. It's way better than temple run and games like tht. Im addicted to it. My cousins and sis is too. Im 12 so I don't have children but I know they will like it
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Connected it with a Nikon D3200 for capturing some video for our products.  REALLY like the length of the cord as there was plenty of length so I could capture the video speaker using our Pettibon products without cutting off his feet. Allow while narrating and capturing video, the quality is crisp and clear.  Only thing awkward about this one is where to hide the cord so that the speaker doesn't trip on it if standing, or the cord become an obnoxious focal point in the video.  We got creative with our CEO and HE drop the wire down a pant leg in the back... Good thing we're friends.<br /><br />If you are concerned about the cord, search on a wireless microphone option.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|this is a movie that your can watch over and over again.... superb action, dram and special effects for the time.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I loved this movie because it was so awesome. My favorite part was the cannon from the neighbor's boat-shaped house. (This is written by a 7-year old :)
0761174192|5.0|The Workman Publishing annual cat calendar is the most feline-loving calendar I have ever encountered.  They never make fun of cats as so many other calendars do.  They don't treat cats as anti-social beasties that everyone can make cheap jokes about.<br /><br />Instead they treat cats as they are.  A complicated, intelligent - and yes, social - fellow mammal.  Not human, but certainly having emotions and concerns that we humans share in common with them.  And also it's about just everyday cat concerns, such as \\"Do I want to stay in or got out?\\"<br /><br />The daily captions are a great complement to the beautiful cat photos.<br /><br />Two of my favorites:<br /><br />- A young lithe kitty reaches high off the ground to catch a ball.  The caption:  \\"The right fielder reaches for the fly!!!.  And... the Black Persian is,,,, OUT!<br /><br />- A book is opened halfway on a library shelf.  A kitten has taken a catnap atop of it.  The caption:  \\"A young literatus falls asleep mid-read.\\"<br /><br />This is respectful of our kitties, and it's wonderfully literate.<br /><br />Thank you so much, Workman Publishing.  What fun 365/6 days of the year.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|I bought this game for my  6 year old granddaughter, and started with the free version.  Even though at $10 the paid version was a little pricey, after a few minutes of play, it was clear that the ads and offers to unlock this or that feature were going to be annoying.  I decided to get the full paid version, and she has really enjoyed playing with this game.
144476490X|5.0|Again James Bowen has written another delightful cat book about his ginger (orange tabby) friend Bob.  The book is well written, which made my reading more enjoyable.  My feeling the Bowen is going to continue writing stories about his life even after Bob has left this world where cats might dream of mice and other good things.  I highly recommend this wonderful book, about love between a cat and his adopted friend, James,who also came from the &#34;cold&#34; of the streets of London.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun gAme bolt is worth the buck game is great  can have fun without spending money but you should get bolt if u hAve the means
B00915G6R6|3.0|Thanks to Amazon, I became a Good Wife fan a few months ago and binge-watched the first 3 seasons.  The actors are appealing and the script is frequently delicious, especially when Peter runs for office or has to do a deal with a devil (Wendy Scott-Carr?) in order to buy credibility.  The relationship between Alicia and Peter seems real and complex and just as fraught as you might expect.  As a lawyer, the legal bits of this show are almost unwatchable.  From the very first season it was ridiculous, but it gets ever more so as time goes on and in this 4th season it's downright laughable.  It's like a pointillist version of the law -- if you stay very far away it looks plausible, but as you get closer it looks more and more like nothing.  The basics of the cases are interesting, but the timeframes and behavior of lawyers are just insane and unrealistic.  Kalinda the magical \\"law firm investigator\\" does not have a job found at most law firms and since she transgresses the law regularly, LG would constantly be in trouble.  Honestly, no big firm is doing that much criminal work, and especially it's not doing blood and guts criminal work. Still, I watch because although the courtroom drama is terrible, the relationships between and among people do feel real.  Law firms do have partners like David Lee, and Diane, and (to a lesser extent) Will and they react in more or less real ways. The personalities of the various judges feel right also. All in all, it's an entertaining show.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I would be hard-pressed to choose whether this exceptional piece is due to the outstanding cast (some of whom are not professional actors), the sensitive direction of Dustin Hoffman, the story (loosely based on such a &#34;retirement&#34; home in Italy), the representation of people come to retirement homes and the sensitive depiction of someone dealing with Alzheimers...  None of this is ever far removed from the wonderful music selections which linger long after the movie has finished.  And speaking of a finish, be sure to watch all of the credits as in the credits are pictures of the real-life people who have parts in the movie.  The pictures alongside their credits reveal a brief bio of their &#34;real life&#34; occupations and contribution to the world of music while they were in their prime.  I could go on and on and on.  You must see for yourselves!
B008Y768XO|4.0|Family friendly. It is a well thought plot that describes how a dog can remain loyal to its owner long past the owner's death.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm totally hooked!  Can't say enough about the nuanced glimpse into the lives of titled gentry and the not-so-subtle changes they encountered from the turn of the century onward.  The attention to detail as it relates to history, culture, societal structure is thoroughly captivating and appreciated.  What many have considered a kinder, gentler time was not always so...depended a great deal upon where one fits into the picture...
0345803485|5.0|I love the book!!! When you start reading the book you cant put it down. It was really worth reading.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Thought I was getting the game and ended up with this.  Oh well live and learn to read before submitting.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I am a fan of Tina Fey but after reading the first chapter, I quickly closed it and thought what a childish immature  piece of fluff. It is as mature as a episode of Brady Bunch. Avoid!
B005DNPJKU|5.0|A real-life story of a man who was dehumanized his entire life due to his &#34;deformity&#34;. The beauty in the story is the process of his true self being revealed and the humanization that occurs. The brilliant acting and unfolding of the story highlight the bravery and resilience of Joseph Merrick (&#34;The Elephant Man&#34;), as well as the kindness and dedication of somebody who cared enough to help turn his life around through educating others and confronting the institutional structures that marginalized Joseph. I first saw this movie at the age of 10 and had never forgotten it. I recently watched it with my 9 and 12 year-olds, and it was powerful and transformative for them as well.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show!  Loved it from the first episode. I'm sorry I'm getting into it so late. Loved Michael J. Fox's guest appearance! Same legal setting as Damages and Suits, but I like these characters more.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I was terribly dissapointed by World War Z... It had nothing to do with Max Brooks World War Z book, other than of course zombies - which were not fast like in the movie.  Basically the premise of the book was to write in the style of a historical series of vignettes written after World War II that were comissioned by the United Nations.  As such, it is a captivating set of short stories, not an entire story designed to glorify Brad Pitt.  Ironically, the book on tape abridged version of the book has far more talent in it - Alan Alda's voice acting alone trumps Brad's lame acting and there are many other famous voice actors.  At best this was a movie inspired by World War Z, or maybe 28 Days (which was a WAY better 'fast' zombie movie).
B006LSZECO|5.0|Surprising - all the way to the end. I really thought I knew what was happening until I got midway through, then that was that. What a uniquely written book with a cast of characters that intrigued me, frustrated me, and shocked me. Just when you think you know someone...I now see why it was on hold at my library for months and months. Great read!
B00DURHYWC|5.0|This cd makes me cheer up instantly....my grandchildren also love it.  I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed Pink Martini in the past.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|This is set is tiny!  I feel like it is way overpriced for the amount of legos you get, and legos are NORMALLY expensive enough.  The box is about a 6&#34; cube.  A set of this size in any other genre would normally sell at WalMart for around $10 and this one was $30.  I will not be buying any more Minecraft lego sets unless they go down to the regularly priced legos.  Which is a shame because Minecrafts pixelated view is PERFECT for legos and every boy loves legos so it seems like it would be a great marketing idea.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This season introduces you to the plot and also the main characters in the show.  They are likeable and we found ourselves on the edge of our seats often, watching how they fight the aliens and encounter all the obstacles in their new lives.  It is a good show and the aliens are created so well it makes it a bit too realistic at times.  But, all in all, a good way to enjoy the evening.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Please do not let the word war or zombie scare you. Brad Pitt delivers a riveting performance. Trust me when he kneels down to comfort his daughter during an asthma attack, he will melt the heart of every father. From the beginning to the end I was captivated by the entire cast! Two thumbs up for WORLD WAR.
B000I55YV2|5.0|This was a flawless movie all the way around and definitely a flawless script! Great group of actors, nice amount of emotion. Nothing was overdone or underdone in this action adventure. This is one of my favorite action movie. Everyone played their role in such a sexy way. The story line, plots, characters, action and even the smarts were right on. One of the best of Mark Wahlberg.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|it was a good book just not as good as the first loved the series loved the book, loved it!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is a great CD if you enjoyed the movie, you will also enjoy this ! Try it out soon!!!!
B00E8JZILA|4.0|To put it simply:<br /><br />This is not an action title. It is, however, more like a which-way book. It has a solid story and the vita controls are a great thing. The story changes based on your dialog tree decisions (The which-way book aspect). More in depth reviews can be garnered from this site or Meta-critic. But as an Amazon buyer I am giving this a thumbs up if you are interested in the walking dead and are looking for story to trump gameplay (not that the gameplay is bad.... it just plays second fiddle to story).
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Each season has it's own plastic box, very decorative and looks awesome!! Also has collectors cards in a sleeve within each season box, they show all of the episodes and a crew member!! I can't say enough!! The first time I'm at a loss as to what to say other than WOWOWOWOW!!!! Really great buy!! Would recommend to any fan or anyone at all that would be interested!!!
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|Great album from Mule. Hard rockers, deep, powerful ballads.This record has a ton of soul, fire, and passion.Just saw them at<br />Fillmore Detroit in Sept., and they sounded excellent live as well! A lot of these tunes take really creative,adventurous and<br />interesting directions, as per usual with this band. Personally, disc 2 with the different vocals didn't do much for me, but, hey,<br />it's &#34;free&#34;, so no harm, no foul. Great to see bands like this still putting out hard & heavy rock & blues amidst today's cheesy &#34;American Idle game show music industry&#34; .......
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Thank you RAP team!! If only I didn't have to reach the end of the book...!!! Humour and timeless wisdom all rolled into one.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|I am hooked on this series. As soon as I finish one I'm straight into the next book. I like how you see the bad side of the police, unlike the cops shows where they are all good looking and all do the right thing.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I Like the plot, the interaction with the Kid and the girlfried got to be extraordinary, if only for a short duration.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I taped this movie years ago from the telly and felt it was time to upgrade to a disc. Highly recommend this movie
B00DHRLK84|5.0|FAN BLOODY TASTIC<br />GREAT SOUND & VISUAL EFFECTS<br /><br />POSTED ALL THE WAY TO AUSSIE VERY QUICK<br />LOOKING FOR MORE TO BUY
B00756GRUE|5.0|I got this at a steal on amazon.  its recently become my favorite watch i wear.  only minor problem i have with the watch is the rotating bezel should be under more tension.  when sleeping i usually wake up with it spun CCW 10-15 minutes.  its not a big deal to me but non of my other watches do this
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEXT MOVIE<br /><br />GREAT EFFECTS & ACTION<br /><br />RECCOMMEND TO EVERYONE DEFINATELY WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS AGAIN
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I have to say I was really surprised at how good this film is after hearing all the bad reviews. I found this film to be a very high quality, intelligent sci fi film. The film wasn't cheap, and you could tell a lot of work went into the production. And I must say the special effects were excellent.<br /><br />I really liked the more serious role for Will Smith, and the film was particularly good because Jaden Smith played his son. The authenticity of the father-son relationship really came through.<br /><br />This is definitely a hard core sci fi film though, so if you are not one who enjoys reading sci fi novels, like the kind written by Greg Bear and Gordon Dickson, then this probably isn't a good choice for you. A sci fi buff would definitely appreciate this film.
B0091REZMW|3.0|THE game is fun but it seems all you can do is keep using real money to buy more gems to do things you need....
B000065V42|5.0|So... I'm no scientist but even I now know that being shrunk to the size of an inch would render you incapable of breath oxygen molecules... having said that.... the movie is still a lot of fun. &#34;take that adulthood&#34;<br /><br />I love the set work they did for the movie, the tall blades of grass, the large cookie and the indoor floor set. The rain drops sequence was pretty awesome as well. The child actors weren't too terribly annoying but the forced love thing in any youth/teen movie always irritated me... still does.<br /><br />Enjoy it... or I'll shrink ya! J/K :D
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|This is a true drama; one that kept you interested all the way through the movie.  It is a movie about humanity and the choices we make.  I enjoyed it.  And, the acting was superb!
B005CM1INE|5.0|Another Stephen King classic.<br />Great performances by Ms. Bates and Mr. Caan.<br />There is a hilarious moment during their final battle... the dummy that stunt works for Ms. Bates can be seen during the trip down to the type writer. Hit A & B repeat for a few spasms of laughter... :D
B0045HCJ94|4.0|This movie is about the images we live, the lies our lives become from living an image rather than facing reality.  It was disturbing, but thought provoking.  At the end, it forced you to take a good look at your own life.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I fell asleep on two seperate attempts to watch this movie. I forgot that I had already purchased the movie once before and figured I would still enjoy it but did not. As an avid fan of everything &#34;Zombie&#34;, I think this movie was a horrible attempt at reinventing zombie characteres and behaviors.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|This was a good movie, thrilling and filled with surprises along the way.  An edge of the seat kind of movie.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game if fun to play.  It is challenging and still easy to play.  It's a very colorful game to play.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Enjoyable, yet challenging acting makes a great storyline tough to follow.  A remake of this movie would be great. Would recommend
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|You just have to remember that this series is in young adult section.after that your like oh yeah this is good. So much better then the movies made of this series with the shortcuts that ruin the flow.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Rose is beautiful :-) There is action around every corner, and more twist and turns. I would defiantly recommend it is a must for Who fan's
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|I bought this thinking that 80 5 star reviews a good app but it stunk I can't shoot jthe enemies because of the tilt
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Every time the guys get into a very tight fix, they always come up with an unexpected solution.  There are several subplots all developing at once to keep the story entertaining.  As soon as one problem is solved, another crops up to keep you always guessing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really fuin games try it you will like it. I like playing it alot, not hard at all, really nice tips
B0090SI582|1.0|What the heck is going on in Hollywood? I am sick and tired of these people who get millions to butcher different comic book canon so they can sale a movie to the masses. Let me count them off here...<br /><br />1. Star Trek Into Darkness - The Khan character period. Magic blood? Single handidly kill dozens of Klingons and oh yeah, several Birds of Prey? Uhura and Spock?<br /><br />2. Iron Man 3 - What the creators of this movie did to the Mandarin is a travesty. Hey, I have an idea, instead of making Tony battle alchoholism, lets give him PTSD and create some inner demons so he can battle with insignificance and mortality. Panic attacks caused by a little kid? Pepper potts is braver than Tony Stark.<br /><br />3. Wolverine - The Silver Samurai is an adamantium robot? Wolverine loses his ability to heal and has to remember of find out what he is really made of? I thought this was stupid in Spider Man 2, I thought it was stupid in Iron Man 3, and it is stupid in Wolverine. Why strip a hero of his abilities to make him seem more human so we can relate better? We aren't supposed to relate, we are supposed to be amazed at what this mutant can do. NOT how he can overcome adversity because he has an inner struggle with humanity going on. Virus cause or whatever, it freaking does not matter.<br /><br />I am tired of these writers taking liberties with all this canon and saying, well, the movie will sale better if we change this. Its ok if we completly change or erase a major villain from that hero's canon.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Just blah. I wanted so much more from it.  I was expecting great things and was left disappointed.  Don't waste your time.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Bones is a favorite of mine and it was easy to give it a top rating. The quality of the discs is excellant.  I am happy with my purchase.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just when you thought you had seen it all on American Horror Story, Asylum proves that was only the beginning,  I was on the edge of my seat during every episode! Loved it,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game, it's just the right mix of easy and challenging for light to moderate gamers.  Enjoy!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I kept seeing reviews for Broadchurch Season 1 on line and really wanted to see it. I don't have BBC America, so I purchased it from Amazon. I spent my first available week end watching it... and am so glad I could watch it all at once. I can't imagine the frustration of having to wait to see the whole thing, but that might also have its own rewards in anticipation.<br /><br />It had great music, great writing, great photography, and great casting. It had everything. I would definitely recommend the series to everyone.
B0090SI56Y|1.0|It was a bad take on fast and furious Tokyo Drift. Horrendous... I hated every min of it. hated it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that  the game is a great game for minion lovers big and small!!!! I love this app yay !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cannot put in words the excellence of this  book.  Moving and intelligently put together. I have never read a book this good and I have read many many books. It's hard to find a writer that can actually make you feel every word of the book. The happiness and the pain. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's simply a beautiful story.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|Very slow in parts and thought it could have had better actresses in some parts.  Will not watch again and sorry I bought it
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|One of my favorite albums of the year. I love when an artist can master their own sound, but not sound the same on every song. This album crosses a couple of genres as well. Great artist and album.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Netflix videos constantly freeze, especially when casting from iPad. Before anyone tries to blame the wifi or internet connection. I run speedtest from iPad and other devices with results of atleast 15 Mbps up and 10 Mbps down. Hopefully Google will work out the bugs in their software and get this device working correctly.

B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi just gets better and better as she gets older! Every song on this CD is fabulous! I listen to this CD in my car over and over and over, and never get bored with it. She has more than the X- Factor, and I put her right up there with my other favorites, Kelly Clarkson, and the Great Christina Aguilera! I would recommend this CD to anyone, no matter their age!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Another WiFi tool that is very good at showing the strength, names and whether the signal is secured. I recently used this to identify the available WiFi networks available for my Brother-in-law for his new garage.
B00004SZWD|5.0|this is one of my husband's favorite albums from Stevie Wonder. it shipped as per the order. i received it in perfect condition and when i ordered the actual cd, i also received the entire album on my Cloud music list...like getting two for the price of one!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I just don't get it. I know everyone uses it but to me I prefer facebook. There is more interaction on other sites

B003JSSPSY|1.0|The makers of this series tried to blend 6 books together... this is the result.. imagine someone take a spoon of sugar... a spoon of salt.. a spoon of chocolate.. a spoon of pizza and a spoon of sphagetti... all of these represent one book each, and they are all really good per se... BUT WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER IT BECOMES UTTER CRAP!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Finally another game as fun as Lost City.  Took me less than 6 hrs total but I used hints a few times. Really fun! I will enjoy playing this one many times. I appreciate a game without dark themes that my 5yr old can play too.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love the game, but i wish i could actually get the dragon I was looking for like the moon and seasonal. I also would love to get gems faster.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|This film surprised me, I was on the fence as I have read the book first. Although this deviates from the book in many ways it is a truly entertaining film.<br /><br />If you are concerned rent it first, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005JLEU|4.0|SPIRITED AWAY is one of Studio Ghibili's most recognized films, having won Academy Awards in both America and Japan, as well as winning the German Golden Bear. SPIRITED AWAY may receive additional recognition now that its director (and Studio Ghibili's co-founder) Hayao Miyazaki has announced his last film. Many critics consider SPIRITED AWAY to be scrumtrulescent--the zenith of animated cinematography and story telling.<br /><br />SPIRITED AWAY is suited mainly to the younger and more imaginative viewing crowd. Those more advanced in years who have become accustomed to more traditional film may be put off. Or, in the words of my parents, \\"this is the weirdest thing I have ever seen\\".<br /><br />Writer and director Miyazaki ties in rich and deep meaning throughout the film; much of that meaning is full of symbolism more easily recognized in Japanese culture. Even so, most creative-minded audience members will still appreciate the various spirits: wind, river, and even turnip. Some of these elements lend themselves to a more scary nature and may frighten a younger audience. Parents be warned, just because Walk Disney Pictures brought this film into the States and dubbed English speaking actors into the film does not mean it's not scary--much of it is.<br /><br />Personally, much of this film was lost on me--until I sought out articles that defined the hidden meanings. Yes, this film is beautiful and irresistible to watch, but the story is incomplete without fully understanding all of its underlying connotations. If I knew the full meaning going into the movie, I would easily give this over five stars, but because I had to do after-viewing research, this film drops down to four stars.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Try cross me color for true nonogram.  I didn't like the game over style.  Typically it should accept any block and make you search for corrections
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So...I wasn't going to read the book, because I had already seen the movie and was afraid knowing the ending would spoil it. But then I thought, \\"Hey, the book is always better than the movie.\\" I am so glad I talked myself into reading it.  Katniss is such an endearing character. The author is an excellent writer. She sets you right there beside Katniss, feeling what she is feeling and seeing what she's seeing. From the intensity of the reaping to survival in the arena. The writing flows and moves you along.<br /><br />I have read some silly novels lately that are ridiculously inconsistent, don't line up or make any sense. Reading Suzanne's novel reminded me what good writing is all about. I just finished the 2nd book of the trilogy (Catching Fire) and realized I had not reviewed the 1st.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book.  I lose interest in books unless they grab me and this definitely grabbed me.  I can hardly wait for the next one in this series.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|BEST MOVIE  EVER this is one of the best classics every one should see this wonderful touching film I promise you will love it !!
B001ILFUDC|3.0|When I received the movie I instantly popped it into the dvd player. I was so excited because I watched this movie a lot as a child. The movie was described to be New/Great Condition and it was not. It was scratched and skipped a lot towards the middle of the movie.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show has a deserved following, me included.  Its v. sad it was cancelled after a single season -- it has cheek, panache and good hearted  writing and acting.  I'll see the follow-up film Serenity soon, and then just let it all go.
B00A5IXYR8|4.0|It was as brilliant as it was when I first saw in 1979. Although my girlfriend did not like it at all, therefore the 4 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you have to get it the grafics are way better and its just awesome al my friends are playing it and ya so.......

1427221936|5.0|Down to earth and who can beat a British accent?  I've tried for years to learn meditation but this time I got it right away.  Mr. Puddicome has no airs or high falutin' superiority stuff going on.  Just wonderful stories and techniques.  He's the real deal for this old girl.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Ally -it is very educational. I really do not like educational<br />books, but it is good. It is a very educational book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy Coin Dozer ;I just wish we got more coins. But it is a Great Game.  Keep up the Good Work!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The games has been wonder. Until 2days ago. I am having trouble getting back on it keeps saying , having trouble with the network. Can you tell me if this is true, or is the game gone. I am 65 and this game is great for your brain.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very easy to keep track of the battery right from the home screen. When I added a new battery it was adjusted to the new capacity within a few days. I do not use most of the advanced features, but as a simple battery status display, I love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves it. He plays along nwith the neighbor for hours<br />its great learning app and keeps him busy
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love and enjoy music and singing so this is my kind of movie!  I watched it so many times and still am not tired of watching it!  The story line is pretty good as well. But the acapella is awesome!
B0090SI56Y|3.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" (2013) is the sixth \\"X-Men\\" film since Bryan Singer directed the first one in 2000, and the second film featuring Hugh Jackman's popular hero without the rest of the \\"X-Men\\" characters. (Actually, some of them return to the series, but about that, later.) What distinguishes the new installment from others is the exotic location of Japan, against which our reluctant hero has to have his own adventure.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Logan / Wolverine's new adventure - written by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, and directed by James Mangold - is not that exciting. Wolverine is summoned by an old acquaintance, Japanese soldier Mr. Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) he once saved in Nagasaki during WWII. Yashida, now head of a big company, knows he is dying, and offers something unusual to Wolverine, who is \\"cursed\\" by immortality.<br /><br />James Mangold did an acceptable job as director, though action scenes lack the style.  As a drama \\"The Wolverine\\" is unfocused because of its convoluted story and unconvincing motives of some characters. Some locations are effectively used, including the beautiful seaside district of Tomonoura, Fukuyama city, which stands in for Nagasaki, though the \\"Japan\\" here is a highly exaggerated one, something you will find only in Hollywood movies.<br /><br />And that is fine with me, as long as characters are interesting. Some of the Marvel Comics characters (re-)appear in the film - Yashida's son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, wasted), his daughter and Wolverine's love interest Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a female ninja Yukio (Rila Fukushima), Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and Silver Samurai, as well as Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising the role) and two other familiar faces who should remain unnamed here - but none of them is really interesting with an exception of agile Yukio.<br /><br />Thanks to Hugh Jackman (and his on-screen charisma and evident acting skills), \\"The Wolverine\\" is not boring. Action is entertaining but not inspired, and thefilm needs better characters and story.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|This blu ray movie is good and funny. I enjoyed the second one better but overall ends with a good story line and point.
B005FQE2E4|1.0|I saw this book in a store the other day and it stopped me in my tracks.  I was, frankly, horrified.  There is nothing funny about suicide.  It's clear to me that most of the people who wrote reviews here have not lost a loved one to suicide, as I have.  I would not normally write about a book I haven't read cover to cover, but I felt like I needed to say that it's really a good idea for people to be cautious handing this book around as if it's hilarious.  One million people commit suicide every year and those numbers are growing.  There's a very good chance that even if you're lucky enough not to have lost someone close to you in this horrible way, SOMEONE you know has, even if they don't talk about it.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|We've enjoyed this season just as much as the other 4.  Love the characters interaction plus we enjoy trying to solve the case, too.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Good ballads and thoughtful music. Some are with US country sound that can double for<br />English country ballads. My wife and I were already Justin Hayward/ Moody Blues fans but<br />everything Justin does always has some new melodies and guitar work and this is what makes<br />him special.  Of course with Justin doing a CD of his own he gets to experiment with the<br />music and he does that too.The melodies stay with you long after you are done listening to them.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Really digging the show. I love mike and the whole shows comedic genius. A lot of interesting ideas. Can't wait for more!
B00A85EMVK|1.0|Loved the original! On the 3-D version, once we got to the halfway point on the DVD, the audio began to freeze. The only remedy was to continually pause-and-play the DVD. Gave up after 20-30 freezes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app (: good for kids. Some glitching but still very fun. I definitely recommend for basically anyone. And its free!
0316228532|3.0|It certainly isn't a cheerful read, and none of the characters were love able or redeemed themselves by the end. Too much like real life to offer an escape.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie like I enjoy any My Little Pony episode any day so I thought it was good.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Love this movie. Fun that our 19 yr. old can appreciate what's now considered an &#34;old&#34; movie. Looking forward to watching with our 15 yr. old in a year or 2.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's hard to believe such a complex subject was so interesting and easy to read.  I loved it so much.
B001NI9X42|4.0|This is a pirate edition of Off the Ground from former pirate label CD Maximum in Russia.  Since a later album is too long to fit on the same CD with another like older ones, the label have bonus tracks that were left behind for 2 in 1 releases fill up space here though B-sides like \\"Down to the River\\" and \\"Style Style\\" would've made more sense here as \\"Mamas Little Girl\\" was from the early Wings days.  The original album wasn't a huge seller as it's not uncommon for older artists to only sell newer material to hardcore fans and grunge was around at this time which affected the charts in one way or another as its cousin punk had less than a generation before.  McCartney has later classics like \\"C'mon People\\" and \\"Looking for Changes\\" (animal rights anthem).  I got to catch this tour (chronicled on Paul is Live).
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very good movie, didn't think I would care for it, got it cause my son wanted it. But this was a good movie.<br />The ending I thought was very bad..... I won't say anything else but the scene at the end in the park.... Come on guys.<br />Magic was good, great job by Morgan freeman, walking you through, showing you and the detective how it was done.<br />Worth the watch
0070511136|4.0|In my company we have based our strategies in concepts like these and we have had interesting results. The most important is to put in practice the concepts of books like this.<br />In particular, I think Spin Selling has a  good redaction, good examples, and the concepts are very easy to understand
B00ESY77LO|3.0|OK adaptation of the celebrated F. Scott Fitzgerald novel has great production design, is lovely to look at, but somehow rings hollow.<br />The key role of Nick Carraway is wasted on Tobey Maguire, who brings nothing at all, besides some rather terse narration.<br /><br />The music is totally anachronistic and completely out of place. It makes you think you're watching some commercial for liquor or something.<br /> One thing's for sure: you can't have it both ways in a period film like this. Music by Jay-Z might sell some tickets, but will date this thing terribly in a few years. They should have taken a cue from HBO's Boardwalk Empire by having modern theme music at the beginning and end, and having all source music within the film be true to the period.<br /><br />Di Caprio is very good, but the girl who plays Daisy is utterly forgettable. I can't even remember the actress' name.<br />Hollywood may never get this one right, but the film is watchable to a degree. The 70's version with Redford has it's flaws, but it's better than this one.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The sublime message is gripping in this movie. I showed it to my mental health students and they were fascinated to see how a brilliant person can easily become illusionary. However, with reality orientation and the love of a spouse this man was able to reclaim some element of normalcy.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Everyone should understand some of the the implications of this discovery, (Higgs bosun) and this is written with everyone in mind.
0312997221|5.0|Brilliant writing. For Adult audiences. Forsythe is a master at creating characters and at weaving recent history into his novels.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I'm glad they decided to say the hell with the crummy 90's version of this movie and make it closer to the Philip K Dick story. This one has the mind blowing &#34;who am I?&#34;  of the original story much better. And the effects are totally 21 century! Watch and then buy this one because you will get more out of it each time you watch it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had to ration this book it was so good. And some more words so I can fill the word requirement.
B00AAZSH0U|1.0|A very mediocre book it is, the drawing is hideous and nothing creative or fun. Cannot imagine how a book like this can get all these brilliant reviews. I wish I haven't been misled by all these reviews and I hope people do not get misled further!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This series just draws you in. There are so many twists that that it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Fun, interesting game that is easy enough to play but holds your interest until the very end. It was nice to play a game that didn't require you to purchase more credit to continue playing. Thinking about getting this game? Do it. You won't be sorry!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The cast gets more developed, the scripts are stronger and the series really starts living up to it's potential! Patrick Stewart is such a strong lead, but the rest of the cast catches up to his talent level this season.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This is the worst app ever it always tells me that it's taking too long please please please fix this in very disappointed
0316069884|2.0|As someone who has read Foer's fictional works before, I was hoping that this non-fiction book would be informative and novel, without making the mistakes of his actual novels. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This book traces Foer's journey into the meat industrial complex, much like Sinclair's The Jungle (which was actually intended to illuminate the inhumane experience of the American worker, but people only really cared about what it said about what they were eating, completely missing the point, but I digress), and the horrors and pitfalls thereof. There is very little new information here for those who have already done any kind of reading on the subject, but I appreciate that it serves as a compendium and introduces the concept of humane eating to those who either (a) don't know about it already and/or (b) those who see Foer's name and want to read everything he writes.<br /><br />I wish I could give this a higher review, but I can't; Foer's OBSESSION with fatherhood is omnipresent in all of his novels, and somehow manages to be even more obnoxious and confrontational here. I really would love to read a book by Foer that completely omits fatherhood as a theme, but it's as if Foer can't breathe unless he talks about the wonders of fatherhood, to such a degree that it boggles the mind and makes you want to throw the book across the room.
B007PFD90G|2.0|Starts off great but soon becomes repetitive and over detailed with names of people who helped out rushdie during his grueling period of captivity. He's such a good writer and I love his novels but I found myself scanning pages of tedious narrative involving his friends and enemies. I'd just seen him speak in Paris and looked forward to this memoir but was disappointed.
B00FVS4EUI|4.0|I am relatively new to the Zombie genre.  Last year was the first time I watched The Walking Dead.  I'm not sure why I resisted for so long, because when I started I was hooked.  I spent most of the first season wondering if I had missed the cause of the outbreak.  What was it that turned people into Zombies?  Then I got to the second season, and found I didn't care anymore.  I got caught up in the various stories of this band of survivors.<br /><br />I'll not rehash the plots of the first two seasons, because you can read those for yourself.  Personally, I felt that Seasons 1 and 2 were the strongest; Season 3 left me with a \\"meh\\" feeling, but I was excited for the start of Season 4.  One thing The Walking Dead does well, is special effects.  30 Days Without an Accident didn't disappoint.  Blood and gore abound, BUT, dare I say, we've got some new material here.<br /><br />When we left Rick and his group bringing the Woodbury survivors into the prison, I was curious to see what sort of community they would develop.  It looks like they've done well in the intervening months.  The Ricktatorship era seems to have evolved into a more democratic system, and Carol and Daryl, along with Hershel have much more prominent positions - the bit where Patrick asks to shake Daryl's hand is hysterical.  So we have this idyllic (as much as anything can be idyllic) little community in the midst of the roaming hoards of Walkers.<br /><br />SPOILERS...maybe...Cut to a pig.  Good choice here as pigs tend to mimic certain aspects of human anatomy...cut to a Walker's eyes...cut to a sick kid...and cut to a rat.  Lots and lots of clues as to what's to come.  I, for one am intrigued to see where this is going.  I'm ready for Rick to \\"get over it already,\\" ready for the issue of the Governor to be dealt with, and I would LOVE to see what's beyond the Georgia state lines.  WIll we get there in Season 4?  Who knows, but I'll be watching.  Thanks to Amazon Prime for giving us the opportunity!

B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|This book went absolutely nowhere and had as bad an ending as I could imagine.  Clearly, clearly, should not have been published.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A complex murder mystery with many plot twists. Excellent character development makes the characters seem real. The novel is so well written that it's hard to put down, and the reader will actually feel as though he or she is part of the story. The s
B00F35BV64|5.0|What does a movie that has amazing actors, well produced and well written look like?!? Give up? That movie is Star Trek! I will admit I'm a scifi junkie, I love a good science fiction movie filled with drama, comdey and plenty of ACTION!! JJ Abrams and the list of people that helped in creating this movie get two thumbs up for me! Gene Roddenberry would be proud that his Star Trek legacy is once again reborn. Anyway, if you are not a scifi person and have no idea who Gene Roddenberry or never watched an episode of any of the Star Trek franchise shows or movies, you will not be totally lost.<br /><br />2nd installment of Abrams Star Trek, the same crew is back again on their second adventure to capture Khan who has attacked the Federation. Kirk and his crew are released in a dangerous mission to hunt down Kahn ...
B002M9WW30|5.0|I've always been a fan of the &#34;Rocky&#34; movies, and when I found I could get the whole series on Blu-ray I went for it!
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|How did Russell Crowe not win an Oscar for this? His performance was brilliant and so was Jennifer Connelly's (she won Best Supporting Actress for this). The movie was very enthralling and I was captivated the whole time. If you're looking for a great quality movie with a little bit of everything (action, romance, comedy, drama, mystery) then look no further. I will not spoil any parts of the movie, but the plot twists are just great, I never saw them coming. The performances are so genuine and the plot is just brilliant. I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love love it it is amazing I can do it all my life.<br /><br />go subway surfers woop woop.

0778328821|5.0|As a knitter, I especially loved the series. I attend a knitting  club/class also and enjoy the comraderie.  I had already read these 2  from the library and bought the rest of the series .  I wanted to share the series with my aunt, but needed the first two.  You know you must read them in order to really appreciate the series.  Can't wait til the next blossom Street book comes out. I hope there will be a next.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Funniest movie so far this year! Really enjoyed the entire movie! It made me laugh out loud,and even cry, don't want to spoil it for anyone. Don't miss this one! Especially if you like Ryan Reynolds, Kevin bacon and Jeff Bridges! Action packed and full of surprises! You won't regret watching this one! Unless you're brain dead!Lol

B007FG9LIE|3.0|Started interesting but then became jumbled. Hopefully the 2nd book in the series will get the story back on track.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|To our surprise, this movie was one our best. We thought to expect the usual adult humor<br />(not for kids) and the usual vulgar toilet humor, yet the entire movie went without the pre-mentioned disgust points.<br />The whole movie was very family friendly, and ends with excellent value. We will be purchasing it to hold in our vault.<br />I don't like the hype, but everyone should see this movie, and decide whether you buy or not.<br />Thank God for the director and writer, many thumbs up. we wish more movies were made in this fashion.<br />Good luck.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So intriguing that I can't wait until the next season comes out! A must watch, starting with season one, so you understand the entire story line.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|What a great product:  Easy setup, does exactly what it says.<br /><br />The only negative of this is it does not work on splash page protected wifi networks (like those in hotel rooms). This is because those networks require you to open a browser and enter credentials or accept the Terms and since Chromecast doesn't have a true browsers it won't work on these networks.
6304244304|1.0|This is absolutely the worst movie ever made. Brando must have been suffering from a serious mental disorder to partake in this farce of all farces.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I really liked Dumb Ways to Die because of all the creativity involved in the ways to die, but I also like it because it teaches you not to do foolish things your friends dare you to. I don't really get why it's all about TRAIN safety, but it's still a really fun game and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to see things you never saw coming before like &#34;eating expired medicine&#34; or &#34;using your private parts as piranha bait&#34;! Very fun game for all ages!
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|Very inspirational.  It is a narrative of how strong our survival instinct is and what the body can endure and recover from.
B008JFUOVI|2.0|The best and the only scenes worthwhile were in trailers.  The part 3 should have been like the end of part 3 and not a drama.  One rents hangover to see over the top funny, and not watch a drama that wants to be comedy.  The end of part 3 is what part 3 should have been.<br />Not worth watching if you want to laugh.  If you want a drama version of part 2 and 3 flash backs then go ahead and rent part 3.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book to read.  It is hard to believe , in this day and age, that young women are denied the basic right of education.  Malala is a very courageous  young woman.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My kids (13 and 8) have read the books and love this movie and the sequel, and have added it to their Christmas wish list to add to their permanent DVD collection.  My husband and I skeptically agreed to sit through this movie with them but have to admit we were pleasantly surprised to enjoy it as well.  Of course as an adult I found it predictable and to drag at times, otherwise i would rate it a 5 star for family night in!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have found that I can use this case for my Galaxy Tab 2 as well.  The top band actually lays on top of the &#34;on/off&#34; button without putting pressin on that button.  It is true to it's color that is displayed.  Very study feel and look!
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Ok so my friend was so obsessed with this album i just had to buy it to see what was so amazing and i was shocked by how much i fell in love!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great season and can't wait to watch each espisode and especially the next season to see what is to come.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After falling in love with Wicked, which was my first ever Broadway show, iv seen it 4 more times since and it will always be a favorite! It has such a great story line that fits so well with the story of the wizard of oz. While including stories of friendship, drama, comedy, abandonment, and pretty much summing up what high school can be like for an \\"outcast\\", this show will never fail to amaze me
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|By far her best album (with In the Zone coming in second), and her only album to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Dance track after dance track, without a single slow song, this harsh and vibrant album speaks for itself.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We are still doing a lot of experimenting, but so far we are very pleased with it. I would recommend it.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the Femme Fatale Tour live and I LOVED IT! With a setlist to die for, even Britney haters will be caught tapping their foot to these killer beats. That being said, the show itself does not film well. Maybe it's the way it was edited, the audio, the camera angles, who knows, but the Epix DVD version pales in comparison to the live concert experience. For better concert DVDs look up Live from Las Vegas (the Dream Within a Dream Tour) and Live from Miami (the Onyx Hotel Tour). While those are better DVDs, Femme Fatale was overall her best tour, combining remixed old songs with addictive new ones from her 2011 album of the same name.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very interesting book. Hard to put down. I definitely recommend it. Can't wait to read the others in the series.
B000002NJS|5.0|By far her best work (many argue over which is her second best, I personally think it's True Blue) Ray of Light is her most spiritual and possibly her strangest album, which is saying something. Every track is gold, with not a filler track in sight, allowing this 1998 album stand the test of time. My only complaint is that she didn't sing a single song from it during her MDNA tour (the only tour I've seen live) which was a crime. Sure, she sang the song \\"Ray of Light\\" to death on her other tours, but that's because it's a GREAT SONG. After being nominated for five Grammys (and winning three of them), Ray of Light continues to be one of the best pop albums in the history of the world.
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|plenty of filters to choose from, still a little common, nothing original, cannot say anything bad about it, either.<br />it just does the job, and moving quite decent, too. only 3* because seen the same effects in other apps, too.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|An unconventional love story, written beautifully. I could not stop reading and almost praying for the life of Hazel and Augustus.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I know lots of people loving it, but this is not for me. I prefer old fashion tapping than swiping, but this is just me. I used it a while but I had to return to stock keyboard. also, the shift obtainable symbols are extremely small and I wear glasses, they were useless..<br />the app seems to be great by all means, but is not for me, thats all.
B00BFV1JZI|4.0|Didn't guess the ending.  not sure what I expected.  Still enjoyed the read though.  Although this trilogy is aimed at young adults, as an older adult (parent) I really enjoyed all three books
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|After hearing all the negative reviews my family and I were surprised to find that it was actually a really good movie. Hope they make another.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|As a second book in a series it was not disappointing at all.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll like the second
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Heartwarming...Timeless...Humbling...  You can't help but love this movie!  One of the best ever!  I have to watch it now and then to remind myself of how lucky I really am.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|My daughter plans to watch the movie with friends for her birthday so I thought I'd read the book to see what it was about.  I found the story so different to anything else I'd read I could not put it down.
055358894X|5.0|Okay, I'm not a very eloquent reviewer when I love something-- is that weird? If you hate something you can provide full blown diagrams and bar graphs on why you hate it, but when you love it every intelligible thought just kinda turns into gobbly guck mush.<br /><br />Someone on goodreads said it best in my opinion,<br />\\"[...] you just can't stop reading even to put out house fires for the last couple hundred pages. And then, when somehow the Gentlemen Bastards emerge on the other side, coated in their own blood and the blood of others, triumphant, you put the book down and say \\"Wow.\\" \\"<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />That is the only intelligible word I can manage after reading the last 300 pages of this book in one single sitting, some of that sitting being done right in the middle of two of my classes for the day because I just could not stop.<br /><br />Full of biting, vulgar and down right hysterical wit, this book spoke to my inner smartass way way too much. Yes, it has a lot of cussing, but I am not one to god damn well care (can I say damn on Amazon?). These characters have set up a nice hideout in my heart and nestled their way in. The relationship between the family of Gentlemen Bastards is tightnit and believable and the heists are intricately planned. I for one still enjoy the imagery of the gladiator like ring where combatants face beats of the sea paired up with Locke drawing in his targets and getting them hook line and sinker.<br /><br />The book exists in two planes, the chapters and the \\"interludes\\" which turn back and reveal slowly the story of Locke as a child and how he got to where he is as well as Jean and the other gentleman bastards. This device worked perfectly to build suspense between chapters when suddenly after a super intense moment---!!! INTERLUDE. It was so hard at those points not to flip through to find out just what the hell is going to happen, but isn't that a good sign that you are hooked?<br /><br />As far as action goes it is wonderfully written and easy to visualize. The extra bits of lore surrounding the city that Lynch explains never is without a purpose and always finds its way to tie back into the story leaving you going \\"Oh oh! That is why that was important!!\\" by the end. It was immensely satisfying to read and immensely fun and I would tell you all to stop listening to me ramble and to read it as soon as possible. Fans of GRRM will be at home here for sure, maybe even more so!
B00DW39B2K|3.0|it reminded me of the Canadian Mountie and his nemesis:<br />i'm going to catch you and *threaten* you with certain death so you can escape and &#34;turn the tables&#34; on me.  duh<br /><br />but i still thought it was okay because how can you knock De Niro?
B000W8HC8I|2.0|I bought the book because it started off pretty well in the sample--a humble young guy on the bottom of the totem poll in a trading office.  I thought we would read how he rose to become a multimillionaire in just a few years.  But instead we skip to him on his personal helicopter, high on a drug cocktail, having just one of countless encounters with prostitutes.  This sums up the book in my view.  Way too much about his sex life, drugs, too many dialogue cliches (including phoneticized regional accents).  Only about 10% of the book interested me and it still left open questions about his business dealings.  I supposed these would be answered in the follow-up book, which I will NOT put myself through.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It's Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie - what would you expect?<br />We don't watch these things for Academy Award performances.
B008MM9630|3.0|I really like this game but as you progress in it, I had lots of issues. I recommend you not buy anything with real money. The game stopped working once I hit level 34 and ended up starting over. I lost everything including the things I purchased. I am going to give it a try again without investing any money to see what happens. Hope it's a glitch they will fix.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Break break break break break break break too50 min to watch 10 min worth of movie. junk internet you tube movies work for me.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|It would be so easy for Paul McCartney to just phone it in - but thankfully - that is not the case. Sir Paul keeps up his amazing legacy with another great solo album that doesn't really break any boundaries, but takes a refreshing spin on his classic sound. It's very difficult for any artist to cultivate a sound, and then keep it fresh for this long, but Paul McCartney achieved it. If you're a Beatles fan, or just a sucker for toe-tapping and endlessly catchy songs, this might just be your favorite album of 2013.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Again, not disappointed with this book. This book moves on from book 1 & the story continues to develop nicely. Moving on to book 3, a great series to read.
B00E688KA4|5.0|The evolution of this band is fantastic. They have create another masterpice for the viking culture. Thanks a lot men.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Great reading, couldn't wait to start on book 2. A fabulous series for anyone who likes this type of series.

B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Seems to work better then most weather apps...hey i haven't deleted it yet so that has to be a good thing.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|This movie - to most people who asked me about it - is downright frightening. I am en epidemiologist so I was very intrigued by the virus more than the actors. There were several moments when I thought to myself, &#34;wow, that would totally happen.&#34; I thought some of the acting was a bit wooden and the story jumped around enough to confuse me at one point. Overall though, it was enjoyable to watch.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I thought the story was blended perfect with the story and the legend of the Magic Beans<br />The graphics were AWESOME .....Love those Giants, SCARY!!!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This was an enjoyable read, although I found the ending unsatisfactory. Parts of it were realistic and anti-Lifetime movie, but overall I thought the author didn't hold true to the strength of the character's feelings for each other.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The characters are phenomenal. I find myself rooting for characters I would never support in the real world, but the writers make them human.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I liked the series a lot, the actors, the plot and the spooky things. Only reason I didn't give it a five star is because of the way they had the ghosts interact, or not, with each other. For example, whenever the good ones were out you would very seldom see the bad ones as well when something big happened. There was really no major comfrontation between them, that was my mayor observation.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Once it is put on and it is not easy to get off.  The front cover does fold up so you can watch things on your kindle fire.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|Fruit Ninja is a fun game but after you buy all of the blades you can't buy any more. I don't know the qualitys of Fruit Ninga on a Kindle Fire because I only downloaded it on my iPhone 4 but all I know is what I just said.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|this is by far the best in the zombie series of movies although the book is a lot different, well worth the watch
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game for kids; I love it because you can ride in a mini cart during the game. l love Temple Run 2 a lot more than Temple Run 1 because you can do so much more! The only thing that sucks is that sometimes my Kindle Fire doesn't sense my finger so I end up dying but other than that this game totally rocks!!
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|Just started so other reviews may be knowable. It is beautiful fun.<br />Early upgrades help you advance without waiting forever. Go.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I find it very interesting and still fun to &quot;connect the dots&quot;  like I did as a child.  I enjoy the challenge.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|When I first started this game up, it took a while to load. I started the first round and found a lot of frames being skipped in certain spots, like right after you let go of the sling when you sling shot him. I find the game play to be very fun, especially because it is not like ordinary bowling. I did not get to play to the end because it crashed on me. This game has a lot of potential to become a very successfully, and a very entertaining game. But at the current state it is in, I have to give it an average score. I would suggest people to get it because... hey, it`s free.
1451648545|4.0|Steve Jobs changed the world through his leadership, charisma, focus, drive and energy. He was someone who could stab a person in the back and have them later thanking him for it. He was also immature, vindictive, bipolar, arrogant, and a manipulator of people sometimes in the cruelest of ways. It will be interesting to watch how history treats him. I am also anxious about how his widow and children will spend the rest of their lives having to deal with Jobs' legacy.<br />Even Mr. Isaacson fell under Jobs' spell. On page 564 he wrote about Jobs, &#34;This made him charismatic and inspiring, yet also, to use the technical term, an ass**** at times.&#34; What would have probably been a more objective statement is, &#34;This made him charismatic and inspiring and an ass****.&#34; Steve Jobs was all that.
B00FE5N09Y|5.0|This is a great box set with a great price. I will most definitely be buying this legen- wait for it, and I hope you're not lactose-intolerant because the second half of that word is -dary set.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love this app because now I can talk to people from my kindle. Most of my friends have kik. It's cool how you can send pictures :) it also sends the messages really fast. It can freeze sometimes, when my friends change their profile picture it takes a while for it to show up on my kindle, vise versa.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|This was a pathetic ripoff of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. Decent special effects. A sad propaganda movie for the UN and World Health Org, in that they could be the saviors of the world.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|I am a paranormal junkie which is why I rented this movie...Lorraine Warren.  I was not disappointed.  I thought it was suspenseful and spooky.  It made it all the better to know this was based on a true paranormal event.  I would definitely recommend as a great thriller.  Just what you need to put you in the mood for Halloween!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game. The only bad thing is , you lose energy really fast, and your people get sick a lot.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I don't know how the actors could make this movie and keep a straight face. Makes the US government look more ridiculous than they really are.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a great movie with lots of excitement.  Hard to figure out how they got so many horses on that hill with the cannon but my grandson said they did it by computer.  I would recommend this as a family movie.
B003AJKPL2|1.0|This device may work on cherries and very ripe olives, but they are terrible for green olives.  This thing broke on the sixth olive.
B008Y212PI|5.0|the game has 5 scenes and 3 different levels (5x5, 10x10, and 15x15) of grid puzzle that can be solved by using a series of logical elimination steps.<br /><br />pros - no adds. puzzles are challenging, but not impossibly hard to solve.<br /><br />cons - can be addictive
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great movie to watch with the family before Halloween! Lots of fun for all ages. This one is a hit.
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|This album is [junk]. All performances are marginal. The songwriting is boring. I loved BC&SL. I think ADTOE is their best album ever, after thinking IAW was their masterwork and then deciding SFAM was the real magnum opus. This album is a slap in my face. Mangini does nothing here. Nothing. After all the hype of their pre-production reports, where Petrucci kept gushing about how amazing Mangini's contributions were, I was disgusted (yes) at how terrible the drums sound and how little they actually contribute. Labrie - whose voice has been spectacular on the last 2 recordings - must've blown his range on side projects, because he's not even hitting the mid-range notes correctly. He keeps ending phrases just a little flat. We know the man can sing, but he isn't showing anything good here. And let's admit it: Myung is a non-presence here, as always. Live, he's pretty good, but he hasn't contributed any creative parts in years. Everyone always says how amazing he is on every recording, but he's not. Listen for him, all the way through. Listen again. Where is he? Where's that amazing playing we keep believing he's adding to each album? It's like Mangini's &#34;contributions&#34; - non-existent. Of course, with Petrucci producing and Rudess constantly aping the guitar parts, who could distinguish the bass? And I swear to god, if Rudess doesn't get some decent sounds out of all his keyboard rigs, I'm going to contact the companies he endorses and beg them to find someone else. I am so sick of the bad 70s synth patches. At least he isn't Sherinian with the constant Hammond sound, but his leads have actually become nauseating. Yes, let's glissando in a ragtime piano sound one more time. Blech. At least Petrucci sounds good. His parts are arranged decently and he can play anything, but the songs just don't live up to his skill. I do, however, *hate* the middle (slow) section of &#34;Illumination Theory&#34;. I didn't buy this album to hear Pink Floyd yet again. I like orchestral work, I just wish all these talented guys could get their [act] together when they're writing the mega-songs and it's time for the &#34;slow&#34; part.<br /><br />&#34;Enigma Theory&#34; is their first instrumental in a long time, and it is completely pointless. No melody, so no harmony or counterpoint or anything remotely memorable. If they add this to their live instrumedley, I will be quite irritated. This sounds like the middle section of a larger song that lost the other ends in the studio. With all the great arranging they've done over the years, I can't believe anyone could get excited about something so... disjointed.<br /><br />I am not a troll. I am not looking for reactions and comments. I am deeply disappointed with this release. The songs are all filler. The overall sound is amateurish at best, destructive at worst. And who the hell engineered and mixed the drums? Dreadful.<br /><br />It saddens me to listen to this album so many times and have nothing good to say about any part of it. I doubt anyone will be influenced by this review. After the last 2 releases, though, I can't believe this is what we got. This album makes FII more palatable - it even makes Octavarium and SC seem a little better. And I *never* thought I'd believe that.<br /><br />Maybe Portnoy was right after all. Maybe these guys need some time off. I know I do, if only to wash out my ears.tral work, I just wish all these talented guys could get their [act] together when they're writing the mega-songs and it's time for the &#34;slow&#34; part.<br /><br />&#34;Enigma Theory&#34; is their first instrumental in a long time, and it is completely pointless.

B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Well done entirely.<br />This is as close as it gets to a historical reality.<br /><br />Cinematography, script, scores, effects, cast, direction, and all are great.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I couldn't find anything with this app. No search and you can't view the videos of people in a list like on youtube.com.
B002M9WW30|3.0|This is the perfect Rocky collection set but the &#34;pack set&#34; and the discs case, all the contents in the box is very poor. No have any book or photography sets about the 6 movies. This should not be called &#34;The Undisputed Collection&#34; in my opinion.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I have NO IDEA how this actually became a movie because of the book it came from, but I am certainly glad it was made, no matter the difficulty.
B008469DGY|4.0|While this is like home run derby for golf it's really engaging.  The physics are cool and you can do things like change ball direction in flight... but it's a game not real golf.  I'm finding that advancing is challenging and am enjoying the app quite a bit.  .99 well spent.
B000002KHI|5.0|I love the strong beat.  The instrumentals are fantastic.  I can't understand most of the words but the beat makes the sound.
B0093QE37S|5.0|It is a classic ...one of my favorites.<br />The actors make a really good movie into a GREAT movie.<br />CLASSIC
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone set has incredible sound. They fit comfortable and sound as cool as the other side of the pillow. These are the standard. These really sound great. It has been getting harder and harder to get a pair of quality headphones that really sound good. The Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone set has achieved that recognition.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love Rocky`s movie, and this Blu Ray is all that a Rocky fan would be like. Really i love it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I have enjoyed this game. Most of the puzzles are easy to solve although once in<br /> a while the solution does not match the pictures that closely.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|While the length of time waiting for the series to complete was crazy, A Memory of Light delivers the wrap up that satisfies that wait. I reread the entire series in anticipation of getting the final installment. An incredible series in breathe and depth with a sometimes over reliance on miniscule detail that could be frustrating but a great read! A Memory of Light wraps up the series with the final curtain in a satsfying process. Flipping among the different scenes allowed me to experience the wrap up of the many different character story lines ~ a great read!!!!
B002UEW31I|4.0|I liked it but didn't love it.  Several pretty bloodthirsty scenes.  Don't know if there is any truth in the movie or just plain war-time propaganda but the movie depicted the clever S.S. Gestapo officer cleverly putting 2 and 2 together in his &#34;detective&#34; work, also the German officer who turned up at the bar &#34;meeting&#34; scene and discovered something was wrong with the masquerading identities of several of the allied soldiers wearing German uniforms, all quite interesting.  Things didn't work out too well for him and the whole scene turned into a disaster for many and the female celebrity actress later was exposed by the S.S. officer's &#34;detective&#34; work, linking her to the bar scenario.  I felt Brad Pitt was playing a part that was beneath his typical role-playing character.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  It is very addictive.  The first of it's kind that I have ever played.  Love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first! It was amazing!! Never expected to love it so much!! One of my new favorite books :)
B001IBIQU6|5.0|this is the only album I somehow missed from the bend been listening to it in the car for days now - great as always from DM
B001ACH4DS|4.0|there is so much more depth to this singer and I cannot wait to hear him stretch. He has a soulful voice that grabs your attention even if you are not crazy about the lyrics or subject matter. I will admit, I first saw him on American Idol and knew he had true talent. &#34;lie to me&#34; is a very descriptive story of the end of a relationship and he performs it in such a way that you feel the pain and desperation.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|it's fun to see the music change as the DM matures<br />just went to their concert - they never disappoint!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack does not disappoint. His upbeat melodies and interesting lyrics keep you coming back for more! &#34;rodeo clowns&#34; has such and infectious beat- I defy you not to dance a little each time it comes on!
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Justin Timberlake never disappoints. NEVER....This album is fun, sophisticated, SEXY, creative, classy, inventive...I could go on... but...well.. you get the point. This is how music should be done!!! Justin and Timbaland are a perfect match! The music that they create together is pure magic! The 20/20 experience part 1 & 2 are both incredibly well made albums.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Decent sci_fi movie and special effects. Somewhat predictable and a little slow. Jayden is definitely moving into his daddy's shoes!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased the Chromecast recently after reading all the reviews that raved about how this was a &#34;life changing&#34; device.  I can see where it has the potential to make things much more convenient, but I have yet to really have a positive experience.<br /><br />I have used the Chromecast to interface with both my iPhone and my laptop and it seems to work better with my iPhone.  Buffering is the main problem with video.  If I attempt to stream netflix to the Chromecast device from either my laptop or iPhone, the buffering will downright drive you crazy.  Streaming from a browser? Forget it.  The Chromecast will eventually time out and just stop casting.<br /><br />Admittedly, some of this may be due to my lower-tier internet connection.  I do understand that this may be a bandwidth-heavy device to use, but I do stream netflix through my Xbox 360 with very satisfactory results on a regular basis.  In addition to that, there are much more streaming options readily available through my Xbox that the Chromecast doesn't support as of this review (Vudu, Hulu, etc...)<br /><br />To sum up, this device could be promising but falls short to replace my normal streaming strategies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy reading my bible.  However, I am going on a long trip, limit on luggage and its weight.  Therefore, the Kindle Holy Bible is the perfect solution.<br />I have been using it daily to be sure I can get to the scripture I want to read.  Very pleased with the ease of finding what I am searching for.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|At times the story line drags, but compells the reader to keep turning the pages. In the beginning, it is hard to get to know each character.  The secret is what keeps the story going. All in all, it was a fun read.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Chris Hemsworth can act but also he is great to look at.  The story was well written and all the actors did a great job.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Well,...  I read it, because so many of my friends,.... and,.. the media was buzzing about it.  Thought I would see what the<br />flap was about.  It turned out to be one of those &#34; can't put it down books&#34;.  Not just the sex parts (of which there are many).<br />I was curious to see how the relationship between these two people was going to work.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Generally underrated by critics.  Imagine a virus that spreads like lightening through an infected human population. Imagine the virus is able to overwhelm its hosts, ramp up the adrenal response and get the hosts up and moving with one goal in mind - propagating itself as fast as possible by taking bites out of other people. The idea that zombies can run and hurl themselves at their victims is a frightening one, demonstrated large scale with great CGI and small scale in the narrow alleys of a Jerusalem whose last defenses fail.  Brad Pitt who is generally always very good is quite credible as a W.H.O. operative who is drafted to drop into the middle of this to find anything that will help a rapidly shrinking uninfected populace find a way to survive. The helplessness and hopelessness of the situation is matched by the sheer terror of roilng masses of infected humans coming at you non-stop. A really good sci-fi B movie for the 21st century. Looks like it was made for a sequel which could have been quite interesting as the ending defies the usual conventions.
0345495004|4.0|It is a great read and an interesting take on Frank Lloyd Wright.  I enjoyed the story even though I really didn't fall in love with any of the characters.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I don't like to have games for me on my phone because I do not have time to play them.  Good game, but not at this time
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was unique and original in many ways. The plot, effects, acting, everything was good. I would have liked an extra 15-30 minutes added to the length for a little more character development. I think we didn't have as much of a connection to the characters as we get into the thick of the movie as we could have to be truly invested in their growth after overcoming the obstacles we were about to watch. Overall, I would definitely recommend watching it. Maybe the special features will have some interesting stuff, and some deleted scenes that will add to the experience.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is something I added for my great grandson and he loves it.  Guess that is all that matters, right??
B00FN8FCO8|5.0|Korn is a band that was once one top of the world.] Korn's downfall is the are not a band that is willing to stay stagnant and produce clone after clone of their hits just to make a buck. Love them or hate them they follow their own path by experimenting and growing. They gave us a hint of that old Korn style in KORN III, but this album is genius. Head's return to their 11th studio album gave The Paradigm Shift, that old feel in a new sound. I would recommended this to anyone who loved Korn's first, second or third album. If there were 6 stars I would rate it 6 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|5 stars for this game.  The children love it.  It keeps them occupied and alert.  I'm not sure it should take the place of &#34;kick the can&#34;, or &#34;hide and seek&#34;, but it's a whold new world out there today.
B008Y76VW2|5.0|This is one of the best kind of movies, just capturing a summer in someone's life. If you haven't wanted to like Kristen Stewart before, you'll like her in this film.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love the game! The graphics are splendid and off the charts! Hope they hurry and finish the second part :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A situation a person could find themselves in and wonder how would I handle it. Another good book by Moriarty.
B00594XOZU|1.0|When I try to log in it won't go it has a message that pops up saying that it's taking too long!!!!!!!!!&gt;:(
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is an amazing author, all of his historical fiction novels are fantastic.  This trilogy is intricate without bogging the reader down.  Approachable characters, great detail, can't wait for the final installment.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read. The ups and downs were very life-like. No matter the financial status, jealousy, heart ache, anger and love are a part of everyone life.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Absolutely loved it!!  I wanted to see it from the time I saw the previews and it was sooo not a disappointment!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Watched it with my 10 year old son. We both enjoyed it tremendously! I highly recommend that you watch this movie!
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you like the Rocky movies -- you'll like this set.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks so clear and you can't beat the price for getting 6 movies -- that's close to a 1/2 day of moive watching
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have an old 1080i 50 inch hitachi. I did a lot of reading before I purchased this product. Its does everything it says very well. I use Netflix and YouTube and they both stream very well on the tv. I'm in Canada so I don't have access to google play music so that feature doesn't work nor did I expect it to. So if you're in Canada and you want to stream YouTube and Netflix videos. This product and price point is amazing.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|American Horror Story Season 2 was very good. I preferred Murder House, but many others prefer Asylum, and there are good reasons for this. Season 1, to me, is only a little better than Season 2.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Awesome anime! Come on with an even greater second season and a full length OVA. Classic anime by every standard.
140053271X|4.0|While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|The story moves along nicely and there is generally something interesting going on. I am sure Reacher fans will be pleased.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|LOVE THIS!!!!! A classic!  LOVE JIM CARREY! !!!!! FUNNY! FUNNY! Never get tired of watching it! A must for your DVD Collection!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This a wonderful functional app. It works well with my kindle HD. I recommend it wholeheartedly. It really does what it states.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like the game. Just wish there was a way to get bingo chips like the treasure chest and keys.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book has a most intriguing story to tell. At first I thought, usual small town  crazy family story, how wrong was I!! the twists and turns throughout the entire book kept me captivated right to the end, to the point I purchased the next book before I finished this one so I could keep reading. Well written Blake Crouch, thank you and I can't wait for the next book!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The run up to the end of the season was typical Downton Abbey; which is to say interesting characters and ebb and flow between serious and light. However, the season finale was a bit too much like a bad soap opera (or are they all bad?). I won't give out the spoiler, but I saw it coming and was hoping, hoping, hoping the writers wouldn't take the road they took, but they did. Disappointing.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I've listened to EWF since early '70's as a tween, and this album did not disappoint me. Right out the gate with Sign on with its funky beat, to Love is Law of course Philip's vocals are just as strong and smooth as ever, of course sliding into Guiding Lights, which teased us for over a year and gave us a taste of good things to come. Then God to be Love followed more than once I thought several tunes made me think of a familiar voice the one and only Maurice White which made me smile, because his vocals are so distinct and very noticeable. Also while listening to the instrumental took me back to a place that only Larry Dunn could fill only discovering when I checked out the songs I saw his name, this too made me smile because he brought so much to the group and always hoped they could reconcile and do other projects. When first hearing about the album coming out, as a EWF fan knew that it would find it's way with the rest of albums, cd's, posters etc already knowing it would fit like an old comfortable shoe. SO for EWF fans they will not be disappointed and I will play this for my Grandkids, who even when they are around 4-5 years old knew Can't hide love, September, and Shining Star so the legacy continues, my kids are already on board and know that they are one of the greatest band is Ever.  Fan 4 life
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game so are the graphics . In other words great game and im young . Awesome! Kinda like grand theft auto. Dude ,just get the game
B004KBSQBA|4.0|I saw the video clip when Paul Simon went to Africa and met the different musicians and I liked the idea and the collaboration very much.  But the CD is a little too folky for me.  My taste is more of light rock.
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|This game I found too hard.  Even the hints did not work. I always try games out but this one I did not like.  It has a nice them but not for kids.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great movie, kept me interested at all times. It's not a scary movie, but it does keep you in suspense and you are always glued to your sit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I personally love this game sooooooo much. I play non-stop for hours and hours. It's so much fun everyone needs to play this game
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A fantastic follow-up to the lingering question of &#34;what happened to Danny...?&#34; I always enjoy the references to other stories too-can you spot them?
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this app! It's easy to use, tells you when you can move or clean files.  It's a snap to backup apps or uninstall them. I highly recommend this one!
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Loved this classic. Robert Redford at his best! Mia Farrow was great as well. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B0015442YU|1.0|It was boring and the acting was histrionic when it wasn't leaden. Sequels are never a great idea, and this is exhibit &#34;A&#34;.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I don't understand how to unlock the screens for more games or find the hidden maps , I am also not sure of all the different moves the characters have
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought it just because the price, but when I had it in my hands, in front of me, I say wow, this is a great backpack at great price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome compareed to subway I love this game so much I wish it was on my phone well I love this game bye
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Grandkids love this game. I can not keep up but they have no problem. Kept them fully occupied for a three hour car trip today.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a great read. The writer weaves a patriotic tale of leadership and adversity as an active duty special forces soldier.
B008Y212PI|3.0|The best thing is that the interface identifies errors immediately. The worst thing is that a fat finger can immediately end the game. The graphics are OK. The puzzles are not that hard, but even the hard ones can be solved through guessing, which the game is tolerant of (up to a point).
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|they tend too stick together no matter what, even if they are mad at each other sometimes true friends to end
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I did not see the wrath of Khan so take my 4stars with a grain of salt. Also thought taking advantage of a certain cameo was over doing it...
140006922X|3.0|I did not enjoy reading this, as it did not seem to &#34;flow&#34; in any way.  I fought my way through it.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|I was in high school in 1986 when this came out.  I was more of a Marvel guy then, but one of my neighbors lent me the comic books and I was blown away then.  I put these on my wish list and received them for my birthday.  I watched parts 1 and 2 about a week apart.  I continue to be blown away.  Yes, the internal monologue / narrative that Batman/Bruce Wayne delivers is absent, but doesn't detract from the story.  You can sense and fill in the gaps along the way, not unlike the way the theatrical and directorial releases handled the same issue in 'Blade Runner'.  The voice acting is superb.  The pacing is proper and builds to the double conclusion at the ends of part 1 and part 2.  I felt at times I was watching the comic brought to life as if I was actually rereading it.  Anything can always be better, but this hits the mark better than 95% of the time.  True fans will see this for a great transfer.  New fans should see this as foundational to all that has been introduced to the Batman mythos and truly in fact all other comic mythos.  Frank Miller's work broke the mold and ceiling regarding treatment of hero/villain.  This treatment does proper justice and testament to his nearly 30 year old vision of Batman as was built from all that Bob Kane had created for his 'Dark Detective.'  Enjoy!
0811879542|5.0|I love the idea behind this book! It is so much fun. My two younger kids, 2 and 6, loved this book. They read it over and over again as soon as my son opened it on his birthday. They loved performing the actions, and turning the page to see the 'results'. I could definitely see this being a huge hit at story time, too.
B00ESNE696|4.0|Amazon Prime is not worth the money. There isn't one show that you can watch for free like Hulu Plus. Even though I really like this show it is not worth $2 a show. Watch it on CBS instead don't pay extra for it.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love this show. So inventive & witty, love the characters (Walter's my fave), the story line keeps you wanting more. Too bad it's over. :(
B00881VLCE|2.0|I loved this app but now it constantly freezes and/or won't even open. Please fix this!! This WAS the best puzzle app I've played.
0547884591|5.0|Excellent. Good book for learning how to cook using the proper meathods. Tons of useful information that doesn't relate to cooking as well
B00EY8ARYS|4.0|new show has promise, but has not found its path after three episodes. it has just been three separate episodes with now flowing narrative, and the world view has not been developed to satisfaction yet, i.e., it has been written like a comic book. i also do not like the writing (or acting?) for the pack leader yet. probably will not survive for more than 1/2 to one season.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Best show on television, sorry to see it end. Acting was superb .  Loved Mr. White and Jessie most of all.  Gus was awesome see him on Revolution,  Skylar was a jerk.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game every one should get it, it does not have every thing yet but more updates are going to come out
0060935464|5.0|I'm grateful for place like this, I don't have to search every bookstore in town to get a classic book. One click and got it in about 2 days!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a fun game, but too many 'disasters ' and game will take your hard earned cash for an option you don't want if you aren't SUPER careful! But overall, it is a fun town building game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the creative ideas it gives me and its simple! especially because Im not really a do it yourself kind of girl
B00006LI4S|5.0|This show brings together the elements that truly capture David Gilmours musical gifts.  The acoustic versions of Shine On along with Fat Old Sun are inspired.  He pays tribute to Syd Barrett with performances of Terrapin and Dominoes and then brings on Richard Wright for a beautiful rendition of Breakthrough.  This DVD is for any Pink Floyd fan who wants to see the other side of Gilmour's on stage magic.  Buy it, you'll like it.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|I have purchased all 3 of his studio albums, his first EP, had his first mixtape and originally heard him in early 2008 on a Weezy track. To be honest, I never joined the bandwagon of all the people who praised him so much until recently. Every mainstream artist besides I say 6 others are not worth listening to, but at least Drake makes good sounding music. It is not better than Take Care, and no where near as good Thank Me Later. I hate when people say, he is maturing, he was at his deepest intellectually between So Far Gone and Thank Me Later. Tuscan Leather is decent, the beat just takes too long to get going. Too Much is a very good song if you enjoy the hook. The Language is in my opinion, the most clever song on the whole album. Pound Cake featuring Jay-Z gave us one of Hov's worst and laziest verses ever, I am now rethinking me being a fan of his. Wu-Tang Forever is a very good song, Own It plays the sample over again from the previous track, and Connect is a very good song.The singles are singles, so if you like them you love them and vice versa. There is no maturity when you hear Worst Behavior, and even though I like the song, his fake southern accent is embarrassing. Aside from that, the only other really good song is All Me featuring 2 Chainz and Big Sean.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Easy to set and has several options for the alarm sound.  Works quietly in the background without taking valuable battery life.  Great little app to have while traveling.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|For me it is hard to review McCartney albums, I was ten years old with John Lennon was killed and it was the first I'd heard the Beatles and really the first time I was excited by music.  My parents had all of the albums so I pretty much listened to the Beatles non-stop from the ages of 10-13.  Each and every song imprinted on me and solidly putting McCartney and Lennon as the greatest songwriters in the world in my mind.<br /><br />I have followed Paul throughout the years and I have to admit there are hits and misses in his catalog, mainly because he is not afraid to take chances and push his music into new territories.  I loved his last album of standards \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" but was also ready for a new album of McCartney songs.<br /><br />Here on \\"New\\" McCartney does not disappoint.  There are some flashes and homages to previous work but there are also strides into new territory.  McCartney worked with four young producers on this album and that may be one of the reasons that things do seem fresh on most of the tracks.<br /><br />\\"SAVE US\\" - The album kicks off with a bang with \\"Save Us\\" a song that rocks pretty damn hard with distorted guitars and heavy drum beat.  Not bad for a guy now over 70 years old!  The track features McCartney doing everything himself except playing the drums and he is in fine form vocally and on the guitar and bass.<br /><br />\\"ALLIGATOR\\" - You can't tell it from the name, but this mid-tempo song is about wanting a companion to be there for all facets of life, someone to share everything with.  There's no doubt Paul's new wife is having an effect on his songs and in a good way.  Some very cool guitar work here and a bit of a psychadelic synthesizer make this one memorable.<br /><br />\\"ON MY WAY TO WORK\\" - A ballad that is vintage McCartney telling a story about a guy longing for the girl of his dreams.  Nice acoustic guitar and Paul's voice is showcased nicely here.  Some heavier guitar in the instrumental break moves the song along.<br /><br />\\"QUEENIE EYE\\" - A \\"life's a game song\\" written about a game Paul used to play as a kid.  From an interview: \\"Now this song, 'Queenie Eye,' is based on a game we used to play when I was a kid. You got to remember that's a long time ago and basically in kind of a poor area I was from. What you did you entertain yourself was go out in the street and play street games. There wasn't that much traffic, so you were pretty safe. And one of the games was called 'Queenie Eye.'\\"  Repetetition and lyrical rhyming will have to getting this song stuck in your head for days.<br /><br />\\"EARLY DAYS\\" - One of my favorite tracks on the album.  As the title would lead you to believe this is a song about Paul's early days in music, viewing it all as a grand adventure that nobody can ever take away from him.  His vocals very up front over an acoustic guitar make you feel like you're just sitting in a room and listening to Sir Paul on the guitar.  Somewhere John Lennon is smiling.<br /><br />\\"NEW\\" - The first single from the record that announced to us all that Paul was ready to get back to rocking after the last album of standards that he recorded.  \\"New\\" is a happy, bouncy song that does not seem to get old no matter how many times you've heard it.  It is a song that stands up there with some of Paul's best pop songs.  Here we are so many years and albums into an amazing career and Paul is still doing what he can to keep things \\"new\\" and succeeding pretty well indeed!  There's a great little vocal play at the end that reminds me of Bobby McFerrin's work.<br /><br />\\"APPRECIATE\\" - This song starts with a dark, but killer groove that just broods through the song.  McCartney's vocals are distorted a bit and run through a flanger at times giving the vocals a cool vibe as he tells us to \\"appreciate the day.\\"  Great guitar work and some powerful percussion make this a song that can, pun intented, be very much appreciated.<br /><br />\\"EVERYBODY OUT THERE\\" - This one is probablyincluded just to be able to play it live.  A fun song with some call and response lyrics that will surely be a hit with concert audiences.  This one features an 11-piece string section and what is billed as the \\"McCartney Family Chorus.\\"  The song also carries a great message from Paul for us to \\"do some good before you say good-bye.\\"<br /><br />\\"HOSANNA\\" - An acoustic ballad that features the lyrics \\"I want to hold you in my arms, I want to take you to my heart again.\\"  Not a bad song, but one that seems to be missing a little something.  There are some \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" type guitars at the end, but they don't really save the song.<br /><br />\\"I CAN BET\\" - This one is a rocker!  It is an \\"I'm going to get the girl\\" track with a bit of sass from Sir Paul who says that after looking her straight in the eye and pulling her closely \\"what I'm going to do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination.\\"  Paul has more game at his age than most rockers half his age, deal with it!<br /><br />\\"LOOKING AT HER\\" - A sweet love song with a bit of an edge.  Pure genius how the vibe of the vocals and music changes when the topic moves from Paul describing the woman and then when Paul describes what she does to him.  \\"I'm losing my mind\\" Paul repeats as the guitars get distored and the music stops.  Truly excellent songwriting.<br /><br />\\"ROAD\\" - A song that could be about a romantic relationship but could also be a song about his old pal John Lennon with lyrics like \\"We came from nowhere\\" and \\"Two crazy partners\\" who are looking for a spark.  An interesting piece that slows down and speeds up and ends on a high note.<br /><br />\\"TURNED OUT\\" - This is way too good of a song to be a bonus track.  The song is classic McCartney with ringing guitars and catchy lyrics.  \\"I took a chance and what good thing, it turned out to be,\\" Paul sings about finding love.  I think everyone has turned down a chance or two along the way and Paul's advice here is clear, take a chance!<br /><br />\\"GET ME OUT OF HERE\\" - A bluesy track that is also way too good to be just on the \\"deluxe\\" versions of the album.  Paul singing with an acoustic guitar and drum beat that really does feel like an old-time blues song.  \\"I'm a celebrity, someone get me out of here,\\" Paul sings with tongue firmly in cheek.  This one makes me with McCartney and Clapton would sit down and just jam out some acoustic blues numbers.<br /><br />\\"SCARED\\" - This one is another bonus track, but truly one of the best the album has to offer.  It's one of the most stark, emotional songs on the album about trying to express deep feeling to someone.  \\"The beautiful birds won't fly out of their cage though I'm trying to set them free,\\" Paul sings over a piano background.<br /><br />The perfect way to end the US version of the record, and I am sure McCartney's fans will have no problem letting Sir Paul know just how they feel about him.<br /><br />\\"STRUGGLE\\" - Only available on the Japanese editions of \\"New.\\"  \\"Struggle\\" is the most electronic sounding of anything on \\"New,\\" it sounds more like something that would have been more at home on one of McCartney's \\"Fireman\\" albums.  Lots of echo around the vocals here as Paul talks about \\"life's eternal stuggles\\" and the song ends in just a mishmash of noises.  Experimental, but still kind of cool.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that McCartney can still write a hit song and this album proves it.<br /><br />How does it stack up against the Beatles' catalog and McCartney's past works?  That is up for you to decide, but I think it is a very good record that I will be playing for a long time.  There are already some songs that have grown on me more with just two or three listens, to me that is certainly a good sign that this album is something special.<br /><br />The bottom line here is \\"New\\" is highly recommended.included just to be able to play it live.  A fun song with some call and response lyrics that will surely be a hit with concert audiences.  This one features an 11-piece string section and what is billed as the \\"McCartney Family Chorus.\\"  The song also carries a great message from Paul for us to \\"do some good before you say good-bye.\\"<br /><br />\\"HOSANNA\\" - An acoustic ballad that features the lyrics \\"I want to hold you in my arms, I want to take you to my heart again.\\"  Not a bad song, but one that seems to be missing a little something.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book, I got my whole department at work to read it. I can read it over and over and not be tired of it. I haven't enjoyed  book this much since Harry Potter.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Bought this for a friend who uses a caller-id system at his restaurant.  The old machine needed a RS-232 port to function, something most new machines don't have.  That's there this comes in, it gives you a RS-232 port by simply plugging this adapter into an open USB port.  Worked right out of the box, highly recommended.
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This movie is so heartwarming, and I love the fact that I frequently see Oher on the football field live when I watch the Ravens play. I think my favorite part of the movie is the real footage at the end of the movie of the NFL draft. If you like sports/uplifting/based-on-real-life stories, this is a good one to watch.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|Lot's of twists and turns that keep you guessing.  However it is one of those movies where at the end you are going, &#34;What?!?&#34;
B002NALPCM|5.0|The perfect mellow jams with upbeat tempo and sorrowful melody that just keeps you wanting more. A new favorite band.
B00FEN000S|1.0|Terrible movie and uninteresting plot.  We rented this for our youngest to watch during an older brother's football game and he didn't even finish it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is okay. It is a fun game but takes too long to load, which can be annoying to have to sit and wait for its to come up or switch rooms.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game.. Good for killing time and pure fun the challenges get better and better. I've been playing for about a year now and love that they made new updates and people.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|There are three basic reviews of this film.<br /><br />THE BELIEVER: Best movie ever, especially when you consider that it's BASED ON A TRUE STORY! So scary to think that there's that kind of evil in the world, but also so reaffirming that there are God-fearing people like the Warren's doing the Lord's good work. Oh, also the movie was well-done.<br /><br />THE NON-BELIEVER: Stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't believe these con artists are getting another movie made about their hucksterism. Wake up, people. The Warrens were awful people who preyed on the hopes of the ignorant and desperate. Oh, also the movie was pretty much like every other horror movie.<br /><br />THE HORROR LOVER: Horror movies are my guilty pleasure. I don't care what the story or budget was, I'll watch it. There are a lot of reasons for this, the primary one being that -- as rare as they are to find -- truly great horror movies can have an effect that lasts much longer than many dramas, comedies or shoot-em-ups. There's a vicarious thrill of survival that comes with an amazing horror film that makes you feel alive and appreciate the fragility of your own mortality. Because of this, I'll watch them all. Every single one.<br /><br />Of course, you can't watch that many horror movies without admitting that 95% of them are just plain awful. Laughable, usually. Maybe 0.09% of them are really great and memorable. The remaining 4.01% are somewhere in the middle, and that's where THE CONJURING falls on the scale.<br /><br />Is the movie well-done? Absolutely. There are strong performances (especially by some of the daughters), great cinematography and camera work, and fairly seamless special effects.<br /><br />Is the movie derivative? You bet. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a single part of the film that is unique. You've got invisible spirits flinging people around. Pictures falling from walls. Creepy kids' voices. Ghosts appearing in flashes in mirrors. Strange bruises. Dogs that refuse to go in the house. A spooky basement. Witches. Corpses floating under water. There's even a creepy doll. For this, I'm afraid it loses major points. If you aren't the horror lover that I am and don't often watch scary films, you'll be suitably scared, I think. But seasoned viewers won't be seeing anything that they won't be able to predict pretty much every step of the way.<br /><br />Even this would warrant 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if it weren't for a few annoying plot contrivances that really took me out of the film. For instance, the Warrens constantly refer to God (Mrs. Warren is fond of explaining how God brought her and her husband together), but their religious beliefs feel tacked on, shallow, and meaningless. My favorite part? Mr. Warren, fearing for his wife's sanity and safety, suggests that he and her skip this particular spookfest and concentrate their energies on writing a book. Mrs. Warren's response? She scoffs and says with great disdain, \\"I don't think God brought us together just to write a book.\\" Ha ha! Yeah. Since when has God ever wanted people to write a stupid book for Him?<br /><br />This kind of smugness in the characters is sporadic, but when it shows up, it is very distracting. Another example would be the fact that, for some reason, they keep totems from every exorcism and de-haunting in glass cases in their home. You'd think people this religious would, I don't know, swallow their pride and NOT keep previously possessed dolls in the same house they share with their young daughter. I'm no exorcist, though, so maybe that's a thing they do.<br /><br />Finally, I was bothered by the fact that the title of the film really has nothing to do with the story, as well as the fact that the credits show us actual photos of the Warrens and the family from the film, really trying to hammer home that all of this was (based on) REALITY. Considering the subject matter, it's a little unfortunate that they try to Blair-Witch it with the hazy line that exists between truth and fiction, and even more so that -- if this story IS true and the Warrens WERE doing God's work -- I really doubt God brought them together just to make a scary movie. Right, Mrs. Warren?<br /><br />Ha ha. Just kidding. I don't really care.een truth and fiction, and even more so that -- if this story IS true and the Warrens WERE doing God's work -- I really doubt God brought them together just to make a scary movie.

034580404X|1.0|This is NOT a healthy book for young people to read. Controlling relationships are NOT healthy no matter how great the sex is. Role play, games or whatever your preference, are okay for consenting adults, but mind control and mental games, just not a health fan of these attitudes. Do women in this day and age like this crap? What is with the juvenile (and VERY annoying) `smirking'? Is that how adults communicate now?  As others have commented, these three books should be consolidated into one.  They don't even break into 3 books in good way.<br />The overrated hype sold this book and many people who don't usually read have gotten caught up in it.  How does this happen while many great works of literature don't get the recognition they deserve.  Myself, I like good but healthy smut vs. the unhealthy, controlling, mental games kind.  Calling Dr. Flynn.
B003QP2TW8|5.0|For whatever reason I really like this adaptation of Persuasion.  I was a little unsettled with the actor looking directly into the camera (into the viewer) as she &#34;thinks&#34; out loud, which is seldom done in filming.  But after a while I felt like the actor was &#34;talking&#34; to me directly and it creates the illusion of a friend telling you her regrets, fears, and desires.  Very interesting direction.<br /><br />I am also very happy with the seller who was very fast and asked for a very reasonable price for a Blu-ray disc only available from England.  Very, very happy with the purchase.

B0058UXHHK|2.0|The writers style is great,it flows well and seems professional.the story base is pretty good,interesting,exciting, and here comes the big but....the way the main character ignores crucial details is sloppily frustrating. I HATED this book. I gave it 2 stars only because it didn't seem like a 5 year old wrote it. The girl is so dumb and the way she acts and all the information coming in and she reacts so stupidly it is disgusting. I only finished it so I could warn future readers. If you have any common sense or thinking power at all you will hate this dumb rambling mess of a story. Grrrrrrrrr
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down! I have read it twice so far because I thought it was so great.  It is now a go to read on my  Kindle when I have free time.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love puzzle games and have over played so many. And with my not unnoticeable love of buttons, I would have them everywhere, combined with a fun puzzle gave that has actually made me think I rate this a 20 out of ten. It helps to make my brain slow down and not think of all those things needed tomorrow making me freak out when I should be sleeping., I play this game. My mind works out a teeny bit making me relax which is hard lol but I can just zone out and play for a bit and fall asleep, I have wicket bad insomnia and the pills only help me stay asleep. This game gets me to relax my brain so I can. Love it, love it, love it. Mush! =}
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book was a joy to read! I have read every Mitch Rapp Adventure and long for more. Alas, author Vince Flynn passed away within the past year and I will sorely miss his very creative writing. Search for Mitch Rapp/Vince Flynn on Amazon. It is a terrific series of books. You won't want to put them down!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I wanted a way to show pictures and movies I took while on vacation.  As well, I wanted to show movies I stored on my tablet.  I was disappointed to discover how limited this product is.  If you are on a wifi with access to netflixs, amazon or such service it works.  If you have your own stuff or find yourself without internet access, oh well, watch some other time.  OK for home use but not for presentations or remote use.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|A decade ago, it would have been unimaginable that Pearl Jam would release anything like Lightning Bolt. The notion that the same band that once released three multi-platinum albums in four years could leave their fans hanging for as long before a new release--the mere suggestion that the same band that so adamantly shunned mainstream sensibilities could later promote an album with a music video, promotional live video, several teasers, and months of hype on social media--this entire situation would have seemed absurd if proposed in the 90s. Yet here we are, with a piece of work that is at once untraditionally traditional for Pearl Jam, breaking barriers even by the standards of a band that built a career upon its consistently unpredictable productions.<br /><br />The elements that make this release uncharacteristically traditional--by mainstream standards, that is--have been well-documented on several forums and grammatically questionable YouTube comments, but for the uninformed they can be summed up by examining the second single of LB: Sirens. Already dubbed the most divisive Pearl Jam song by fans, Sirens has been heralded as everything from Pearl Jam's best shot at matching the commercial success of Last Kiss to embodying the death throes of a band supposedly washed up. In my opinion, the truth lies somewhere in the middle (perhaps closer to the former). Sirens is definitely not the generic power ballad that many people described it as upon its release. Clocking in at almost 6 minutes and lacking a predictable hook that is requisite for a radio hit, it isn't really a pop song either. What it is is one of the most powerful songs Pearl Jam has written. The lyrics deal with loss in a way that no band would dare attempt on a commercial single, and its composition lends it to a slow-burn approach, where the power is not immediate but creeps up on the listener gradually. Many people seem to have forgotten that PJ music is rarely immediate, but for every naysayer uponrelease was the story of a tear-struck listener who felt the lyrics personally. Also important: the solo at the end is some of Mike's most understated and salient work, reminding us of the influence David Gilmour of Pink Floyd has had on McCready, with his ability to cap a song off powerfully without ruining the dynamics with an all-out shred.<br /><br />Despite the pop sensibilities, this is not Backspacer. The sound is darker and much more experimental: whereas I felt Backspacer was intended as a celebration of the band's evolution and newfound peace with themselves, Lightning Bolt feels like a reminder that PJ is still capable of pushing themselves and their fans. My Father's Son comes to mind as an embodiment of PJ's willingness to write music that won't just listen to, but that you are forced to really hear. Its obstinately amelodic rhythm part will frustrate you on the first listen as you fruitlessly attempt to predict where the song is destined for next, and I almost feel like Eddie purposely writes the first two lines to sound like they will rhyme until you hear the word the second line ends on, which is like a shock through your system as you try to reconcile the nonrhyming couplet with your conceptions of music so far. With each listen you'll feel like you \\"get\\" it a bit more, and soon it feels familiar enough that you're rocking out and waiting for the next PJ song that will push you to explore what turns your ears on. Honestly, our ears don't really know what they like, we don't know what we like, and bands certainly don't know what we like. Trial and error is all we have, and songs like MFS are explorations into what you can do before the song is too far-fetched to be a song, and in this case it pushes the boundary without bursting it, leaving the listener very satisfied.<br /><br />Perhaps I should take a step back now and touch on the flow of this album, song-to-song. The opening track, Getaway, has a fantastic melody that really comes together thanks to Jeff Ament's fantastic bass line. This is definitely one of PJ's better opening tracks, but it also feels more familiar than the rest of the album. The song gives way to Mind Your Manners, a punk-inspired song that served as our first taste of PJ in the studio after so many years. I remember hating the song on the first listen, and I think it's due to the mixing of the guitars, which feel too weak to serve the opening of the song well. However, I've since realized that the opening of the song only exists to lead to the second half of the song, where it really ties together with a messy and fantastic McCready solo and a very fun chorus.<br /><br />Next up is MFS, a great follow-up to MYM that I've already touched on, followed by Sirens. This is where the album loses its cohesiveness and you suspect that something went wrong (more on that later). Next is the title track, and then a great one-two punch that is Infallible (incredible verse but unexpectedly generic chorus, I feel that the band didn't know what to do with what might have been their most interesting opening riff) and Pendulum (perfection and completely unlike anything PJ has written thus far). Next is Swallowed Whole, another awkward transition that breaks the feel of the album as a whole. This track works well with the follow-up, Let the Records Play (very bluesy with another chorus that I feel doesn't stand up to the rest of the song), and then the most offensive transition comes with the next track, Sleeping by Myself.<br /><br />SBM is a largely criticized effort already but, in my opinion, it is actually a very worthwhile rearrangement of one of Eddie's solo ukulele songs (and the ukulele part in this song sounds SO MUCH BETTER than in the original recording. I also love how for a moment the song is just Eddie and his uke, a nod to the original song). However, it has NO PLACE after the build-up of Swallowed Whole. At this point two issues are apparent. One: LB is not intended to be a cohesive album. There are certainly central themes to the songs, but it does not flow at all. This brings me back to a theory of mine, that the reason Ten is considered PJ's best album outside of their fanbase is because it is by far their most cohesive album, even if their later albums have plenty of better composed and more interesting songs. The second issue is that this album was recorded between two sessions, and by Brendan O'Brien, who has lately been more interested in channeling PJ's pop-side than producing an album. His piano playing is perhaps his worst offense, sounding like a Casio keyboard and sticking its nose where it certainly does not belong. Indeed, the closing track sounds irredeemably cheesy until you learn to ignore the piano intro and outro, after which it is a great piece, like a more fleshed out acoustic song compared to similar efforts on Backspacer. Anyway, BoB's mission is in many ways resisting the natural direction that Pearl Jam has undertaken, which is that of experimentation. It really does feel like they need to look to a new producer. One who is not comfortable enough with the band to allow his personal preferences pervade the album, and one who the band is not comfortable with, paving the way for more effortless experimentation .<br /><br />Overall, two things stick out to me about this album: it is a crime that we had to wait four years, but it also feels like the band should have waited a bit longer, that they were not quite ready and BoB's push for them to reenter the studio was a bad move. Certain songs sounded like they had potential to redefine the band for a new generation, but they are disserviced by choruses that feel like an afterthought (granted, an afterthought by the folks at PJ is a thought that us plebeians could never hope to conceive on our own). Looking at this album, I'm reminded of The Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. That was an incredible album, easily worth five stars (whatever that means), but it was a rushed effort that began when S&G's producer meddled with the title track and added an electric guitar part. Sure, the song was very successful, despite the fact that the guitar is grating to the ears and overdubbed poorly, but listening to the album it doesn't quite feel right. Similarly, taken individually, the songs on LB are great despite some poor producer moves, but as an album I almost feel like I'm hearing a compilation of the bands' work over the last four years rather than a cohesive studio effort.<br /><br />But at the same time, when the album is playing and my hunger for PJ is finally being satiated, I can't bring myself to care that much. Sometimes art isn't satisfactory in the strictest, most complete sense, but I think, just like the voice-cracks in Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Wild, The Innocent...\\", the shortcomings can eventually define the album as much as the excellent portions, and at that point it's all the same really. So in closing, let me reaffirm my love for this album and optimism for where the band is headed. I'm already eager for another album, but I'm also hoping that they take the time they need. And to cap off this review, I'd like to say thank you to Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Matt, Mike, and even Brendan (heck, throw Boom in there too) for giving me something to care enough about to write this entire review.
B005LAIII0|5.0|The Life of PI is really about dealing with grief.  It was slow moving at first building a required foundation, once the action started you cannot turn from the screen.  It has a twist at the end that might be a surprise.  It leaves you to ponder, what survival skills do you have, how do you deal with loss and trauma, is rigid religion preferable with death or can you find ways to manage during the crisis. Above all, we discover that no matter what happens, life goes on and each of us finds strength from deep within and from our roots.
B00992CF6W|4.0|You should add more stuff to craft. All I can craft is pretty much wool. And it shows pictures of items when you craft, but I do not know how to get those items. I hope you add more stuff to craft, and villagers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this based on a friend's recommendation. I could not put this book down. It is a very engrossing story and the characters are very complex.
B003V5CFV8|3.0|The drama was not any thing special, or at least nothing to remember, but the acting was done very well. A sad story from the south with a little humor.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I am so excited for such a wonderful translation of God's word the Bible, what a loving way of helping us appreciate our heavenly father even better. The best part is its FREE!!! how amazing...:)
B00F52YOPA|3.0|It was fun until the room was decorated. Then there was not much to do except try to collect a set number of certain objects.  It would be more interesting if there were more rooms to work on or different types of challenges.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|I bought this as a gift and it was well appreciated.  Good product.....good price.....good reaction from the recipient.  Well done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought this mainly for my grandkids to play but I have also played it.  It is challenging  and fun and the children are much better at it than I am.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great update from the DVDs. A/V differences don't really show up until Rocky 4 but the last movie is worth the price alone.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|Even though the season just started and I just finished watching the first episode, I have to say I was very impressed with the season starter.  Just as with prior seasons the unexpected happens and the gore is just as impressive as in the best, but better because of the prior seasons of working on the models, sculptures, etc. that make the unbelievable, believable.  One thing always amazes me, and that is it is always summer in the series, never winter. Georgia is not hot and humid all year round, but that is just a minor issue.<br /><br />I started watching \\"The Walking Dead\\" since the very beginning and I hope the rest of this season compliments and connects well with the past seasons.  BTW, great title for the first episode of the season.<br /><br />Cheers!
B0035HKWLW|5.0|I enjoy this film very much. It is just like the cartoon version. The dog with the mask is really cute.
B0013FSXT6|2.0|This is one of the most tedious and pretentious films ever made, which is an amazing thing to say because the film is filled with some of the most beautiful naked women ever seen in the history of film.  Unfortunately, the visuals are accompanied by the most obnoxious music score ever.  This film is an absolute piece of crap and it is amazing not only that Stanley Kubrick made it but that he took two years for him to do so.  But if you want to see a naked Nicole Kidman, this is the film to see!
B005LAIIGM|5.0|The performances in this movie were superb, and the special effects extremely interesting.  I interpreted the movie as something of a depiction of an avatar experience for the woman astronaut, since the circumstances presented were so obviously impossible to survive.  It is interesting to think that the ability to realistically depict physics and make magical extrapolations seamlessly that introduce fantasy point to great improvements that have been made in movie-making in recent years, and the possibility that it will not be long before, at least for wealthy individuals able to afford it, such exciting avatar experiences may be open not just as movie depictions, but seamlessly woven into individual lives to experience fantasy-worlds in a realistic way.  This film points in a new direction for imagination, from books, to movies, to actual immersion in a \\"fantasy experience\\".
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|After I got the CD of Ms. Peytoux I found out I don't really like her choice of material.  The singing is good but the songs are uninspired to say the least.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read ALL three of these books, and must say that this is writing at it's best!!! A must read by all!!!
B00DJZR46G|2.0|There are 2 great songs on this CD.  That's not enough of course but it is all listenable.  The only problem is that other than the 2 fine selections the rest of the songs are all &#34;B sides.&#34;
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good hidden objects game.  It does get tough when all the objects move to different locations each time you play a room, but that's what makes it challenging.  Good graphics, and there is a story line to it, which other free hidden object games I've tried did not have.<br /><br />I don't like that it takes a lot of energy to play a room.  That makes it so you can only play a couple times and then have to quit for a while and come back.  There's too many &#34;special quests&#34; that go on art the same time.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this game.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This voice isn't what it used to be and the material is old time for sure. But you can tell Paul is trying to be good here and do justice to some fine standards from the Great American Songbook.  He has respect for the material and that's commendable but the CD is a little boring and sad to actually listen to.  He ain't 28 anymore...
0634049011|4.0|I find that this book presents a sound method of learning the entire fretboard. It takes consentration and self discipline to stick with it.
B00004XMV6|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago and I do have the sequel to it. I just wanted to see mickey rourke whenhe was a gandsome dude again.  Good movie.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Every attempt to download the game after purchase results in a screen-freeze.  I give up.  Seeking a refund from the folks at Amazon...
B004LWZW24|5.0|I bought this movie becsuse the second one came out in the theaters and I wanted to get the background of it. Yes it was scary so get it first. It arrived in a timely manner.  Good movie.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|My grand-daughter was so used to the animated version of Peter Pan. Well, she absolutely loves this with the actors!!! She has watched it over and over....can't get enough of it.  She is 6 years old, and she said it was the &#34;best&#34; Peter Pan she has ever seen.
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|Last we saw Alex & Katie they were lost in an enchanted world. Now. they are back and onto their second adventure. This time around, they are off to save a young man, but they get a bit sidetracked and meet some colorful characters along the way.<br /><br />5 stars to a fairy tale where characters truly create the ending.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I don't normally review books because they are more subjective than an article you may buy.  That said: I am a Christian that doesn't practice, nor do I go to church.  I saw this book on a TV interview and something struck me that I had to read it.  I found it very profound and enlightening.  I am sure there are people who won't like it, but the BACKGROUND to the Christian religion is absolutely fascinating and because there isn't much real information on the actual life of Jesus, this book approaches his life story by the history of the actual times he lived. I found it a little confusing at times and having a map of the region of the time would have been really helpful. I will probably read this again, and will make a chart of the people and places while I do it so I can keep the timeline straight. I would definitely recommend!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Really gives an excellent insight into introversion. Being older, it was eye-opening to look back and realized the labels that were put on me is not the way it was. I just wish people realized that years ago. Maybe....just maybe I may have a different, more outgoing person. Thank you Susan Cain for making sense of the life I lived.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This one is awesome if you keep the volume all the way up and that is why I like this alarm<br /><br />!
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|Excellent manner of showing the thinking of those in power while pursuing the actions of U.S. foreign policy. A bit frightening.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down.  The description of the country and lives of the people were at times poetic and beautifull written. I never felt that any words written were wasted.<br /><br />I was very impressed and touched by Malala's young life.  What she has accomplished and shared about herself, her family and desire for education for girls has been an education for me!  This book has made me reflect upon my own life and made me aware there is so much more to be done in so many areas of all our lives.  I have gotten complacent and comfortable. It is time once again to look beyond myself.<br /><br />I look forward to following Malala as her life continues as she follows her dreams and am amazed and pleased of the support that she has.
B009AMANH4|5.0|My wife is a huge fan of Lincoln. We saw this movie at the theater so I wanted to get this for her as a gift. To me it was a good movie very entertaining. As far as historical accuracy goes well I'll leave that up to the real history buffs to critic. I really liked the debates in the House of Representatives and Tommy Lee Jones was great as always. Bottom line, if you like American History and the Civil War then see this movie. Let me emphasis that this isn't a war picture but does show some battle scenes and aftermaths.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|A great movie to watch with my grandson. It took me back to the days of Godzilla only the special effects were far superior.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|if you enjoyed the early 90s dance and pop music you will enjoy this cd and it will make you smile, laugh, and cry. Unlike most new dance music today which is generic and provokes no emotion at all just to top charts and be catchy..<br /><br />My favorites are \\"my love\\" \\"red\\", \\"sirens\\", \\"favorites scars, \\"i hope u find it, \\"Take it like a man\\", and \\"Pride\\"<br /><br />My most fav is \\"Red\\" though i hope its her next single.. Plus Cher is how old? whoa, go Cher!!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This game is fun to play and easy for my mind that is getting old to keep up with. They have lots of levels that are more difficult for those young people with guicker minds to be challenged with.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I cannot say too much because this could really happen one day...<br />set in a post-apocalyptic America, he heads west walking on the<br />highway of death with a book in his backpack that everybody wants....<br />He has only one purpose of getting to his destination and no one<br />or nobody can stop him...not even a bullet....action packed,<br />violence, some disturbing scenes, but will he make it ???<br />You have to watch and see for yourself....it has additional scenes<br />that are not in the t.v./ movie version....
B002VPE1WK|5.0|compact backpack with adjustable dividers. dividers and backpack has fairly good thickness (padding). there are ample side and interior pockets for storage and separate compartments.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|This is a pretty good movie.  I really liked the original Star Trek movies, and was glad when a new one came out.  This one has a rather inane plot.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Not only can I understand the language and its meaning but is awesome to be able to compare the scripture to other Holy scriptures versions within the same application.  Unfortunately is not in Spanish language yet. Hope to see it soon...
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I believe it is an pretty easy fun intellectual game for everybody if you are looking for a great picture play game then I recommend emonji
B000ICRKLM|4.0|More of it! Again a big hit with me. The 3 stargate series are the best in sci - fi. The five seasons were the best!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Intriguing story, well written. The pace of the story was very well done and the storytelling kept me coming back for more.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|It will be interesting to see how they top the end of season 3 . The governor, will he return? Or who will be the new threat?
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love the book so much. It is so interesting and is cool that he added in the Greek gods.
B00459GJUM|4.0|This was one of the best stargate series. I only wish they could have ended it with another season or a full length movie, so that they make it to the end of their quest.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Nice ideal but missing some much needed functionality and 3rd party app support. Only really works with the select products listed.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|At first my 6 year old granddaughter and I thought this was not a very friendly use game.  However I noted it had a likeness to angry birds in how to make granny to run and obtain the goal.  The cane use cracked me up.  After a couple or runs with us playing together she kept saying one more.  Fun choice.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Stupid boy becomes man plot<br />Will Smith just sat in a chair the whole movie<br />Would not recommend this movie
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Good acting; wish it was longer.  Have always loved this story and thought it was as good as the BBC mini series that was made later
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a wonderful way to share ideas with other people!  I'm a pre school teacher and I love to see others creative crafts and fun plans for their classroom...
B005EHILV4|5.0|Very well constructed and and works as well as much higher costing mixers.  Just fine for limited audio recording (has only one mic input). Fairly low noise and versatile connection possibilities.  Recommended for a simple recording setup.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Hi I'm mario. I really like the dear Hunter series. I've got DH reloaded, and the original. And I found this game, witch looks awesome!!! I'm still in download( 7% I have slow net)I can't wait to play it! It seams fun and all of that. I've read some other reviews saying`I can't download` and `prices are too high` well I think prices are good. If you want a awesome gun, work for it! Thanks for reading my review, bye!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|It took a while to get here and the packaging was hard to open but was well worth the effort but was well worth the effort and the wait.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Outstanding!!! Very realistic and very easy to use with little or no instructions needed. I highly recommend this game A++
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is very convenient to have on the Kindle. No need to scramble for a calculator now that I have it so readily available.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game includes everything that a person enjoys. It is fun, simple, and most of all addicting because you just want to get all the next few things
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. Just wow. From the title of this novel you know there will not be a traditionally happy ending but the way Mr Green takes you there is poetic and gentle.<br />This story made me cry but in the best way possible. He writes in a way that makes you understand the characters but apply them to yourself, so it comes out as a greater understanding of life than a story about a specific character.<br />I know that I will be thinking of this for days. Definitely something you should read.
B005LAJ212|5.0|When I first heard of Revenge, I thought it was another ABC failed attempt to rise back to the top.  But when I watched the first episode, I was hooked and I bought the whole season on DVD.  The result: it is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched.<br /><br />The whole story is about a woman, who comes back to her family-home in the Hamptons and is looking to lay her past to rest.... literally.  The woman's name is Emily Thorne, but her real name is Amanda Clarke, and has returned to get revenge (title reference) on those who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit.  While searching to gain vengeance, Emily (or Amanda, whatever she likes to be called) runs into people from her past and also sets a series of events that will affect everything and everyone.<br /><br />The summary sounds like it lays everything out in front of you and you think that you have the whole thing figured out.  Well, if you do think that, you are wrong.  This story is planned out way bigger than the summary lets you believe.  Yes, it is about revenge, but it way more than that.  I'll review a little bit more and I promise to try to keep my spoilers to minimum.<br /><br />I really do love this first season of the series.  It was well-paced, well-written, fun to watch, exciting, and even sexy as hell.  The whole storyline starts off fresh (in its own way) and starts to build up towards a lot of things.  We are introduced to a lot of characters (who I will talk about in a little bit) and we also are given explanations to a ton of stuff.  We learn to what really happened to Amanda's father, David Clarke, and why he was imprisoned.  We also learn some really exciting secrets along the way.  One of which you will not see coming and will definitely leave you speechless and shocked (foreshadowing episode 12, \\"Infamy\\").<br /><br />As for the characters, they are done really well.  The main protagonist, Emily Thorne (real name, Amanda Clarke) is not exactly the type of girl who you would call \\"nice\\" or \\"thoughtful\\", at least when you are the one being targeted by her.  Emily is a troubled woman, who is out of revenge and doesn't care about anything or anyone (which we see change over the course of the season).  While it looks like she happy on the outside, you can quickly tell that she completely the opposite on the inside.  We also have Victoria Grayson (the main villain of the story), a woman who has a more troubled past than Emily.  Victory is portrayed as a deadly woman, who knows how to make threats with a single smile.  Unlike Emily, Victoria is filled with regret for the things she has done (a small reference to certain betrayal).  We also have the great Nolan Ross, who Emily's closest and most loyal friend.  Nolan is more of the comic relief of the story and also the backup for Emily's plan for revenge.  Trust me, Nolan will bring out a few laughs out of you.  There is Jack Porter, who is a certain person from Emily's past and (sort of) a love interest to her as well.  We also meet Jack's little brother, Declan (who I swear looks like a more younger version of Orlando Bloom), who plays the love interest to a girl named Charlotte Grayson, who is the daughter of Victoria.  Keep in mind that Charlotte plays a big role for the season.  We also have Daniel Grayson, who is the son of Victoria and also Emily's second love interest in the season.  Daniel is more of the \\"innocent\\" boy who is looking to do something with his life and not have to be part of the Grayson family business.  And finally, we have Conrad Grayson, the husband to Victoria and father to both Daniel and Charlotte.  Conrad is the secondary villain of the series and plays a great role as well.  If there is one thing funnier than Nolan himself, it is the conversations between him and Victoria (trust me).  There are tons of other characters who play big roles in this story as well, but I think the series does a better job at introducing and explaining them.<br /><br />Sense we are talking about revenge, this series really does live up to the title and the expectations that comes with it.  \\"Everything\\" is almost about revenge.  Emily's motives are for revenge and so is her commitment to it.  Her everyday life and thoughts is pretty much revenge.  Not only that, but some other characters get revenge as well.  Somewhere along the way, we see someone getting back at someone who did wrong to them.  People may be think that this series goes to far, but if you actually watch the series, you will understand why Emily and others do what they have to do.  Especially Emily.  Out of all of the people in this series, Emily has the right to do what she has to do.  Her perfect life and father was taken away from her and she spent the rest of her life in a living hell.  The little girl who smiled and loved everything was killed when her father was framed and put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  Heck, even after he was arrest Emily was going through a living hell of her own.  The nightmare was everlasting for Emily.  It left a huge impact on her and it looks like it will never go away.  If you truly want to understand why she wants revenge, just watch the freaking series and find out.  With me, I agree with Emily and say that she needs to do it.  I know I couldn't live on or have peace, knowing that the people who did evil are living like there is no tomorrow.  I believe that if justice can't be served, then revenge has to be.<br /><br />As for the ending, I won't say much about it.  I can't go heavily into it without revealing a few spoilers (if not all of them).  But I can say this, it ends on a high note and also reveals one more secret that leaves you wanting more.  In fact, this secret that comes with it is not even seen coming.  The ending was satisfying and leaves a lot of room for season two.  If you want to find out, you have to watch it, that is all I'm going to say.<br /><br />If you do think about it, Revenge feels more like a Count of MonteCristo story.  It has the revenge story feeling and also that dark atmosphere that the novel had.  Not to mention that Amanda comes back with a new name and a lot of money, which she uses to get revenge on the rich (or those who framed her father).  That sounds a whole lot like Edmond Dantes to me.  If you read the story, then you can see the connection.  Also, some of the small time villains fit the description of a few villains from the novel too.  I do consider this series to be inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo and believe that it almost lives up to it as well.<br /><br />Is this a tv series that you would be interested in?  Well, if you like revenge stories and twists and turns, then I would say \\"yes\\".  But if you are the forgiving type and aren't really interested in vengeance, then I would say \\"maybe not\\".  Truth is, this is not a story about forgiveness.  Even Emily herself says this in the beginning and end of the first episode.  There is no forgiveness and no salvation, just revenge and darkness.  My personal opinion, I love revenge storylines and dark stories.  They always seem to make better stories and they seem to have something for everyone.<br /><br />I really do love this series and I highly recommend it for anyone.  It will shock you from beginning to end and will never once let you go to sleep without wondering happens next.  I say buy it and watch it with friends or family.  Heck, watch it with both!  Enjoy it and just have a great time!<br /><br />Revenge Season One is the best!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|dragonville used to be a really fun game. but after I spent countless hours and my entire entertainment budget every month on this game Backflip Studios upgraded their game making drastic changes to the breeding rules. the new rules make no sense and have made all the time and money and effort I put into this game worthless. Before the upgrade this was truly a five Star Game. now it isn't even worth one star. very disappointing I wish they'd give me back the game I loved so much
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A very flexible app that allows the various translations of the Bible to be in the palm of your hand - I love it!
B003I55BIA|4.0|This was a really sweet book and I really enjoyed it! I was worried the author would sort of glaze over the gang membership to make everything easy for Alex in the end but was pleasantly surprised by how she ended it. It really fleshed the story out more and made it seem more realistic.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good item search game.  Wish having friends and energy weren't required.  Most games require this now, so it's expected, but still fun to play to kill some time.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Caught this with my wife in South Carolina this summer.  After the movie concluded, my first thought was \\"this is like the Big Mac I had on 95 South for lunch.\\"  Not bad because I was hungry, but totally forgettable.  Once again, it looks like far to many Hollywood suits got involved in this movies production and created yet another low bar, kind of acceptable to everyone yet non-offensive, Big Mac.<br /><br />P.S.  Kind of like \\"Terminator Salvation.\\"  Great core material to work with but.....they needed to add a robot with a heart of gold and such.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I don't know why people complain about this, especially when they get it for their kids. I don't see anything in there that should be objectionable for children, and if you think your kids can be sheltered from &#34;real cussing&#34; you're fighting a losing battle anyway. The animation is amazing, the characters and voicing pitch-perfect, and the story engaging. If it's not exactly like the book it was taken from, so what? Not much is.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|Works bit is far too expensive. Other manufacturers are going to build their own versions of this and undercut your price dramatically.

B004G606K8|5.0|I love the Dragonlance series and have read many of the books more than once, this one being no exception. Being that my work requires travel for extended periods of time, it's impossible to bring my book collection with me hence why I've started buying the kindle versions of all my favorites. It's not quite the same as holding a physical copy of a great book in your hands, but it's better than not having one to read at all.
B0035S996U|5.0|I saw this movie in Downtown Los Angeles back in the 70's. Joe Walsh sings &#34;in the City&#34; at the end of the movie. Watch &#34;Streets of Fire&#34; or &#34;Rumble Fish&#34; as well for a 70&#34;s- 80's youthploitation teenage angst flashback.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a remarkable paean to the leaders of the Indian Independence Movement whose spirit lives on in Malala's words and deeds. It is remarkable because so much time has passed and so many things have changed. Yet, her ideas and philosophy embody the broad vision, the compassion, the universalism of leaders like Gandhi and Nehru. I was enthralled by her attitude. She is never bitter or hateful. Always a positive attitude in the face of both human and natural catastrophe. It's what the Sikh's call \\"chardi-kala\\". Looking at snippets of interviews some have criticised her as a \\"stooge\\" of the CIA or American interests. But the book reveals that she has an intimate and in depth knowledge of all the players. She is nobody's fool. She is a keen observer of events and doesn't hesitate to share her views on various people and political policies. It was at times surreal, inspirational, sort of like seeing Katniss Everdeen, the fictional hero of The Hunger Games, come to life. Malala is young still and must finally get back and complete her cycle of being a \\"student\\" (in the relative safety of England) before seriously embarking on her chosen career path as \\"political leader\\" if that's the future she genuinely wishes to pursue.

1250038820|5.0|Brandon's work is something really special. I've only been following his blog for a handful of months, and his photos and stories are incredible on their own, but that's not even the most surprisingly special part about this project. Read the comments on his Facebook and blog, the positive to negative ratio is unlike anything I've ever witnessed on the Internet, a place I thought only ever brought out the negative and judgmental side of people. People relate to these individuals in ways that each one of us, on our own, might never have imagined. This book, to me, represents more than just a fabulous addition to the \\"art world\\", it represents a movement of humanity and all of the positive qualities it possesses.
1885167776|3.0|Can't wait to read this. Highly rated book and Gary Keller will be speaking in Boston soon, so I want an advanced read.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the book arrived VERY dusty (like it was in an old warehouse). I cleaned it up, but I'd just prefer to receive something NEW and not dusty.<br />Arrived early if not on-time, and well packed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun and very addicting. It's fun to play along with so many others from the comfort of your home.

0143122916|4.0|Remember Maslow's Hierarchy of Need? This is a story not about escaping from a mere camp, but escaping a preordained existence as a stock animal in human form, and the difficult struggle to become a fully-realized human being. Before love and empathy can be attained, hunger must be satiated; safety must be secured. To a human being bred, born and raised as a slave in a prison camp, concepts of love and family are meaningless. The guards are your family.<br /><br />Aldous Huxley once proposed that his concept of a kinder, gentler oligarchical police state outlined in Brave New World was more likely to retain its power and sustain the underpinnings of its society than the repressive, brutal regime outlined in Orwell's 1984.<br /><br />Yet here, in North Korea for over 50 years and continuing to this day, over 200,000 human beings are born, bred, live, die and make babies in just that kind of ruthless, Orwellian police state where children spy on and rat out each other and their parents. It is a state that utterly deprives human beings of their humanity, and denies them even the merest glimpse of the outside world. The irony of the title is that however unlikely, Shin's physical escape from Camp 14 (the only person known to have escaped from there), he will never fully escape the guilt and the psychological damage that rendered him an \\"animal\\" for the first 23 years if his life.(less) [edit]
B007SVPZMW|2.0|If you can't move it to your SD card, then it is just taking up valuable space on the device. 26M for  simple game. I uninstalled. I'll give it a higher rating once you're able to move it to the SD card.
B008YE9226|1.0|This rambling, incoherent tale of depressingly human, modern gods would have worked much better packaged as a series of unrelated vignettes with sometimes recurring characters intended for young adults.<br /><br />Gaiman loses narrative focus by trying to squeeze every bit of research he compiled on americana and mythology into this titanic novel.<br /><br />There are sparks of genius in these writings, and I view this behemoth work more as a failure of editing than a failure of writing.<br /><br />The plot of the book centers around an epic battle between Old World and New World gods. A storm--readers are told--is coming, only to evaporate into nothing with more than 100 pages to go. The central character bears a likeness to Dante's pilgrim being given a behind-the-scenes tour of what lies beyond the veil. Unfortunately, he is such a passive, emotionless figure that his trials and hero's journey are not engaging enough for the reader to care much about his fate one way or the other.<br /><br />The simplified characters and situations in this book made me realize why Gaiman's writing seems to work better for me when it is specifically targeted at the young adult audience--indeed, he seems to click best with that genre. Unfortunately, American Gods went all over the place and nowhere simultaneously. Gaiman's characters' dialogue is rife with aphorism, platitude, tall-tale-telling, and fable--all solid building blocks of young adult writing.<br /><br />Here is another book, much like Tender Morsels, where a brilliant author put too many ingredients in a half-baked cake with the timer not set while the editor was gingerly sniffing at--but never bothering to really taste--the final product.
B003BOUKRU|4.0|It´s a good gift for friends in this Christmas. Good songs, nice show. I recomend to everyone. My Family loves Celine.

B00CHVIPP2|2.0|If I would have gotten the Bluray/DVD+Digital Copy+Toy. Shipping was fast, like always, but I was super disappointed to find that the product was only the DVD+Toy. My son already saw it and ripped into it, and since my Bluray player also plays DVDs, it isn't worth the time or effort to return. Great price, had it actually been for the Blu-ray and all. Pretty disappointed as this is the first time I have ever had to write a negative review on here. The only positive is that my son doesn't know the difference, and this is a really cute movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works great and I use it all the time. I would that no most people would have this app.

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is a fun game to play based off of the Advetisment from Metro promoting Train safety.When i first played,I was thinking definitely five stars...because they have variety in the mini games and the animations are just adorable (Not the death but you know what i mean.) But then i got to a mini game where you had to blow to keep the plane up (a feature of some Ipod touches and ipads.) I searched for a setting to turn certain games off,and found the setting for the plane game.But as I continued playing,i finally got a round of a mini game where you must plug bullet holes in a charcter being shot by moose hunters.Now,the first round i had,there was only two holes to plug,so i was fine.(because kindles only let 2 fingers interact at a time)But soon enough i came across a round where i had to plug more than two holes,and couldnt do it.Please update and tweak the game for Kindle Fire users,to make it more compatible.It is a five star once it gets tweaked if it does.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I felt the book was very well written and look forward to the next one. Every once in a while I might roll my eyes at some of the dialog, but it didn't take away from the story. The author really brings you into this world and the character development was top notch. I highly recommend it.

B002P79KAC|5.0|The humor in the sitcom is off the wall funny. Anybody with a strange sense of humor will love it.
B00EVPSJOE|2.0|This is quite baffling. The performance was remastered, and it's not much better than it was. In fact some things were moved to the centre speaker and were better where they were in the original 5.1 mix. Sound is now available in DTS -- improvement, no doubt, but why no higher quality available?<br /><br />And then there's the rehearsal. Why on earth wouldn't they include the whole performance, including outtakes, in surround sound? The rehearsal's sound isn't good, it's stereo only. Interesting maybe, but not something you'd watch more than once, not to mention listen to. The outtakes CD contains tracks that should have been included in the new DVD release.<br /><br />This performance deserves five stars, but the new 2013 release is simply half-assed. Pretty ridiculous, if you're already making an effort, why not go all the way?

B00EQUP3Q6|4.0|I was a solid fan of NiN through The Fragile, which I still blast to this day (although in a luxury sedan, versus a crappy car with awesome 6x9s and a 12 inch box). There have been some small flashes of brilliance on Year Zero and The Slip, but those were pretty spotty albums. This is the first NiN album that I can listen cover to cover since Broken - and no, the genres are barely comparable, it's just this album is that good. Gotta wonder if the track &#34;Satellites&#34; was produced before or after the NSA scandle broke? T. Reznor, I like your healthy sense of paranoia!

B009IHED0E|5.0|This is a very beautiful album; what is especially nice about is the rich production and the eclecticism of it all.  I hope word gets around about it; and I hope it will prove to be very successful for Rob Reid.  Some of the songs were very personal to me, in fact the whole story resonated deeply in me because it was so allegorical.  I am biased anyway because I love the music of Magenta and the way this fine band readily admits to being inspired by the progressive rock bands of the 1970s.  My only regret here is that there is not a score higher than five stars.  Sure, it's not everyone's cup of tea but it is certainly mine.  I love the entire opus but I simply adore the song, &#34;Lilly&#34;. I give thanks to the New Musical Discoveries website, and especially to Russ Elliot for recommending it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Read the first two chapters and was hooked. The characters, the setting and the narration is sharp and get you by the throat right till the very end.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Admitted fan boy. With that said, I can't keep this album off of repeat. The strong start is both moving and nostalgic, reminding me of the band PJ was and what they continue to be capable of. Then it's a journey; an audible exploration of their evolution over the past 20 years. Age, family, faith, mortality, uncertainty, all of it is bundled in the lyrics and bundled in the strongly played emotions of the band. Yeah, the album ends lightly and ballady, but man, the songs are powerful and they reflect their current POV. I love it so much. I hope it isn't another 4 years, but if it is, this album will sustain me. Thank you!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I've always hated when people review a film that is not even out on DVD let alone Blu Ray so here I am being a hypocrite.  However, this review will be on the tech side of things to create anticipation for the Blu Ray DVD.  Since I can't establish what the video transfer will be like I can only say that, in the theater, the film looked gorgeous without a hint of the great amount of CGI green-screen work that went into  this film.  That said, I will focus upon the 3D aspects of the movie, the audio and some of the not quite realistic occurrences while trying to avoid the actual scene description.<br /><br />AUDIO....<br />  I sure hope that when this film comes to Blu Ray it will have the choice between a 5.1 and 7.1 lossless audio.  In the theater there was a great amount of discreet directionality coming from the rear, the sides and the front channels.  This is where a 7.1 audio system would really pay off.  Great use of audio foley effects throughout the entire film and plenty of sound to put your LFE channel to good use.  I realize that most Blu Rays come with a 5.1 audio and that is fine but Gravity really deserves the option for a 7.1 mix.<br /><br />3D.....<br />  I was spellbound by the 3D effects when seeing Avitar for the first time.  3D came a long way from the old blue and red cardboard 3D glasses of my youth watching Vincent Price in The Pit and the Pendulum.  Avatar's 3D brought depth beyond anything I had hoped to see.  Unfortunately, there then came  a slew of converted 2D to 3D films that fell horribly flat or a bunch of cartoon animated 3D films that just don't cut it for me.  Gravity was shot with 3D in mind and it does pay off.  As I watched the film the 3D did not stand out as an epiphany of new vision for me but, in many ways, it was far more realistic in its presentation.  There were many scenes where droplets floated towards you or the director used a static foreground to further help the sense of depth.  Overall, the 3D was really very good and not used to titillate you into ducking a flying sword.  It had better be good as $27.00 for a matinee for my wife and I is more costly than I expected.<br /><br />REALISM...but possible<br />Spoiler Alerts as well....you decide.<br />  Gravity is probably the most realistic Sci-Fi film to come along in many years.  However, there were some things that were done that simply could not be.<br /> 1)You can not use a fire extinguisher  as a jet pack.  It would send you a rollin and tumbling without any directional control<br />2) If you are tethered to something or someone in outer space, you could not float away pulling them with you.  All they would need to do is to pull you back.<br />3)  You can not use a jet pack to bring you from one orbit into another orbit.  It doesn't have the necessary fuel and the orbits are on different angles like one hula hoop inside another at different degrees.  It just wouldn't work.<br /><br />  Since I am not reviewing the actual Blu Ray disc here I can venture off my usual 'disc quality only' standards and voice my opinion on the performances.  Not quite sure why George Cloony picked this film as his role is really only to add a touch of humor and confidence to Sandra Bullock's role.  She played the character lost and on her own brilliantly and if she does win an Oscar I would cheer her on.<br /><br />  As I cannot make a Blu Ray purchase recommendation let me finish by saying that due to the great quality of the visual and audio standards that Gravity adhered to, I anxiously await its release on Blu Ray and pray the audio comes as a lossless 7.1 soundtrack.  I hope this review has been of some help to you .<br />Thank you for reading.nd not used to titillate you into ducking a flying sword.

0375869026|5.0|This book to me was very good. I always wanted to read more and more. This book is a great starter chapter book, if you are looking for a challenge. Overall, I loved this book! It is my favorite book! You should definitely read it!
B007EECSFA|2.0|Took me 400 pages to get into this novel and even though the ending was creative I still was not impressed with the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It keeps me involved I like coming back to see completed tasks and getting to compete. I thoroughly enjoy this game
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I love this new album from Paul McCartney.  My favorite song is the title track \\"New\\".  It puts me a great mood.  This song motivates me to explore different options in life.  This tune gives me a sense of confidence that I can succeed in these new endeavors.  My other favorite song is entitled \\"On My Way To Work\\".  I relate to this song because I ride the bus to work every day.  I often have a magazine to read.  I often feel bothered by smokers just like Paul sings in the song.  \\"Alligator\\" is a song about longing for companionship.  I can relate to the lyrics about trying to find that special person.  I think that alligator is a cute song title.  \\"Early Days\\" is a song about Paul's early days as a musician just struggling to get his music heard.  This is another song that reminds me that my dreams can come true if I work hard.  \\"Everybody Out There\\" is an up tempo song that implores me to try to make a difference in the world.  Some of these songs I love just for the beat and the energy it provides me.  \\"Turned Out\\" is a song that reminds me that I can do things to recharge and center my life when things gets chaotic.  \\"I Can Bet\\" is a song with a great beat.  This song is about the trust and unpredictable nature of relationships. \\"Hosanna\\" is a sweet love song\\".  \\"Appreciate\\" is a good love song about expressing love for a special someone.  The lyrics are harder to make out because of the musical arrangement, but I enjoy the song any way.\\"Save Us\\", \\"Queenie Eye\\" and \\"The Road\\" are three groovy rock songs.  I could enjoy the rhythm and tone of these three songs without trying to analyze the words. \\"New\\" is a truly entertaining new album from Paul McCartney.

1451695195|5.0|profound and uplifting<br />good read for Christians and non believers alike<br />I highly recommend this book<br />I purchased it because I heard our Pastor mention he had read it, but religion is not the basis for the story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious because of the hype over the movie, so I read a few of the \\"steamy\\" chapters that people have posted on various websites. Then I decided to read the two chapters posted here. I made it about halfway through the second chapter before giving up. The writing is sophomoric...literally. It reads like it was concocted by fifteen years old girls. The sex scenes are hilarious and kind of anti-erotic. I'm not wasting my time or money on this. Charlie Hunnam is smart to have backed out of the movie. I'm assuming he read the book and realized that he'd be making a terrible mistake to go forward with the project.
B007THA4FI|1.0|i stopped reading this book almost halfway, i found it so depressing. such a bummer, i just read cuckoo's calling and loved it!
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|This book is guaranteed to make you smile and to lift your spirits. A wonderful story for all dog lovers or anyone who needs reminding of the joy in this world.
140006922X|5.0|I read this book with only minimal knowledge of the historical context of the time that Jesus lived and died. The author has provided quite a thorough view of the history, before, during and after the life of Jesus in this region. It is clear that a lot of scholarly work has gone into finding out the historical facts from this time, a task that is difficult based on numerous conflicting documents. Based on this the author conducts an argument that frames the role of Jesus as a righteous revolutionary that was trying to fight for the independence and self determination of the Jewish peoples that were under Roman rule. The 'zeal' (from which comes 'zealot') is the purpose and drive for his vision. There appears to be a conflict between the historical Jesus and the Biblical accounts of Jesus. The author implies that the life of Jesus was utilized by his followers in decades later to form an organized religion that separated from the Jewish faith. This understandably can offend some readers but not those that are open to ideas that can explore the life of Jesus as he walked on this earth. Overall I found it to be a good read that shed a lot of interesting facts about the life of Jesus.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The author took us through a brilliantly woven history of two women. I learned a lot about what it was like for orphan children in the Midwest coming from all kinds of backgrounds. Beautifully written.
1616550414|5.0|Very we'll put together. Does a good job of explaining a lot of what can be missed even by hardcore or long term fans. Beautiful art. Half the book is dedicate to Skyward Sword, which didn't make top three for a lot of gamers, but the rest is a well done canon of Hyrule legend and mythos, plus plenty of concept art.  Well worth the buy.
B00E9PVFHE|2.0|Poorly written.  Sad Rachel McAdams was a part of this catastrophie.<br />Save your torn and money.  Not worth anyone's time
0345803507|5.0|love it as the first one! like the first one i couldn't wait to get the last one of three... the story is amazing...a little to tired with the sex parts... but loving story.
0399165274|5.0|Forsyth has delivered another winner. I took a chance in buying this book based upon the author. I was not disappointed. The book centers around a hunt for terrorists using all available technical, human and friendly intelligence service techniques. If nothing else, he points out the difficulty in penetrating a terrorist network which uses family, religious and language connections to remain hidden. You don't have to be male to read and enjoy it. The action is riveting and believable. The story is so real it could have been taken right out of the world-wide news. I highly recommend it.
0345803493|5.0|just great!!! this one was awesome too. I think from all the three the first one was the best from 1-10 i gave the first one a 10 and the second and third one a 9.... i'm sad i had finished the story. Now i feel like i want more of Christian and Anastasia...
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this show. I wish it would have never been cancelled after just one season. In my opinion it is the number one show cancelled early. I'll leave it short and sweet, if you enjoy scifi then this should be in your collection.
0345803485|5.0|i love it! it was soooo explicit! entertaining...i fell in love with the characters....it trapped me all the way to the end.... i couldn't wait to read the second one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw a movie preview and thought I would like to read this book before I see the movie.  WOW!  I'm so glad I did.  A Third son is born in a world that allows 2 children per family.  Of course, this is no ordinary family.  Three children who are all genius. The youngest one is selected to train to become the commander of IF and defeat the alien enemy (Buggers). The story is so well written.  Enders is a young boy brought into a situation he didn't ask to be in. He struggles with loneliness and isolation from his family and friends.  With this emotional baggage, Ender must train and learn to be a commander. I can't wait for the movie now.  This was a 5 star read.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This is a really cute movie.  It's funny in its own way.  Very unique.  It tells a story about our past.  There are many points to take away.  The relationship of the protective father.  The rebellious daughter who is dying to get away from the same old thing, the survivor who meets the family and tries to change their lives.  It was great.
B0060CRM6M|4.0|Cute movie, nice story line....had a few laughs and my 8 year old loved it!  Hope they make a sequel!
B00AOCXBUU|5.0|Excellent movie.  I can watch it over and over.  The story line, the action, the idea is genuine.  I loved this movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Asians book Zealot is  well written and very readable. I would recommend it for every thinking Christian. He has a good grasp of history and the violent times in which Jesus resided.  While his history is well documented he stretches theologically to force Jesus and his mission to fit into his premise that Jesus had a political agenda equal to his spiritual mission.  Asian boldly asserts  that writers such as the apostle Mark were not as interested in the resurrection as they were with the political movement of the times.  However a reading of the last two chapters of Mark clearly undermines his assertion. He argues that the gospels were written after the Judean uuprising and meant to apease the Romans. The dates of the writing of the snynoptic gospels have never been definitively established but Luke clearly basis his Gospel and the Book of Acts on the &#34;many writings&#34; which preceeded his and Matthews writings, allowing for the real possibility that much in the gospels could easily be based on events prior to 68 a.d.  Asian's history predating the birth of Jesus es excellent as is his assessment of Roman problems and attitudes in 34 a.d  This is an excellent book.  I read it twice and highly recommend it.

B0012GMXSS|1.0|I bought this mostly because I was interested in this band and the reviews on here made it seem pretty good. I probably should have actually listened to this band first, because this album is pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend this, it's pretty tasteless and depressing.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I wish they would let Duke live instead of killing him off... ( oh yeah spoiler alert !!!) sorry about that
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Deeply felt situations of love addiction, devotion and misconceptions of love and the struggles to overcome and let go.  Great plot!  McConaughey was fabulous as was Sam Shepard as his...mentor/confidant.  The young boy who co-starts was also excellent in his struggles with the realities of a family falling apart, love and dedication to those he loves and wants to help.  Really a gripping excellent movie.
B003F29D44|5.0|I have not watched this since it first came out but my daughter needed to watch it for an economics class.  I forgot how good it was.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|They couldn't dig down deep enough for this one.  Horrible plot...and got more ridiculous in this anti-climatic dud.  Not half as funny as any of it's predecessors. The dialogues was hard pressed for laughs even the obvious immature ones that have made the first two movies a hit missed the mark.
B00F91H666|4.0|I liked it. Brad Pitt was cute The zombies were fast and more challenging. It was engaging and kept your attention the whole time.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Some movies cater to the lowest common denominator. This one found something underneath that. If that was their goal, they did a good job of it.

B00DC8O6T8|4.0|Album: 4 stars; Live show: 5 stars<br /><br />I recently saw Capital Cities in concert (more on that later). I bought this album when it just came out in June as it was on one of the CD listening stations at my local independent record store here in Cincinnati. I had never heard of them, but a quick sample of the songs was enough to convince me I just had to have this. It hasn't left my CD player at home much since then.<br /><br />\\"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery\\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the now all-too familiar \\"Safe and Sound\\" single, which of course is a great tune. I must say I was quite surprised when that tune broke massively on mainstream commercial radio and made it into a Billboard top 10 hit. (So much the better for the band.) But this album is so much more that the radio single. \\"Kangaroo Court\\" seems like another radio-ready tune. \\"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\\" is as much fun for the lyrics as it is for the tune. \\"Center Stage\\" is one of the songs that so vividly recalls the 1980s. The good tracks keep coming one after another. \\"Tell Me How To Live\\" is another massive sing-along. The album falters a bit at the very end (I could've done without the closer \\"Love Away\\").<br /><br />Just this past weekend I saw Capital Cities in concert for the first time at the Corona Capital music festival in Mexico City (the Mexican equivalent of Coachella). The band played a mid-afternoon set in the blazing sunshine, but it didn't stop them from bringing the beat, and the heat, and the fun. The massive crowd ate it up and it became one ginormous dance party. The guys played mostly from this album, and live it sounded better and more massive than on the album. Interestingly the band included 3 choice covers in their set: the Bee Gees' \\"Staying Alive\\", and Madonna's \\"Holiday\\", which are rather obvious choices. But the band opened their set with a cover of... Pink Floyd's \\"Breathe\\"! I couldn't believe it and couldn't have been more charmed and impressed. Capital Cities brought the best set of the festival for me. Meanwhile \\"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and it surely won't be long before the US is under a tidal wave of Capital Cities fever.l Cities brought the best set of the festival for me.

B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Iron Man 3 was an exciting movie with plot twists and very cool technology.  I enjoy the tech toys that Tony Stark has and what they can do.  I was glad to see the relationship take off with Pepper and Tony.  The movie is not all happiness though with some of the violence especially toward the end.  I would think a 10 year old or younger may think it is too violent.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|From the first page, I was thoroughly engrossed and felt as though I was living in the pages rather than my own reality. In many ways, it is similar to &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; in drama and scope except I found the well drawn characters more lovable and believable than that old favorite. I tore through the book to find out what would happen to these characters that I was so attached to, but am now feeling the ache of loss because I have reached the end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm a huge historical romance fan - and this  isn't even my favourite era! - but the characters are so well drawn, the sense of history and class struggle, everything was very well done.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|The story line was captivating. If you know or are learning french, you will enjoy the frequent use of french phrases.  If you don't know french, their use will not affect your understanding of the story. The only part I didn't like was the ending relationship with Laurent which was too unbelievable.

B003VANOFY|3.0|UPDATE: After having the headset for over a year the crackling was being caused by the WiFi signals in the area I was using them. When relocating away from the WiFi transmitter the crackling noise went away.    However, a new issue started to occur. Every 15 minutes the headset would turn off. The battery was fine and it would turn back on straight away. Heading to the Logitech forums, there is a help post on how to disable to auto-turn off which resolved the problem but isn't ideal as it didn't used to happen - [...]  The headset is great when it works but it has niggling issues that just mean it is occasionally more of a problem than a solution of not having a cable running to your PC.    Original Review:  Like some of the other reviews on here I have ongoing crackling and popping audio problems. You can Google G930 Crackling to understand just how wide spread the problem is.    I have tried numerous \\"fixes\\" from Steam forums, Logitech forums and even other more obscure sites with no luck. Uninstalling the software and running Windows default settings is actually more stable and reduces the distortion but it is still there. I'm surprised Logitech has allowed this issue to continue as it appears others have been reporting it since the headset went on sale.    On the plus side, the headset is very comfortable and well built, now if they could just fix the audio it would be an instant 5 star review.

The character development was great and I felt like I knew someone just like every person in the book. JK Rowling wrote their lives so well that you couldn't help but be affected by each and every one of them.<br /><br />This book is definitely not funny. I mean, it's got a few lines that are funny, yes, but the material is not. It's a little heart-breaking and so true to real life.<br /><br />I can't wait to see how BBC turns it into a tv show.

B0060D0H54|5.0|Not well known but terrific movie with Bruce Willis and beautiful actresses Radha Mitchell and Rosemund Pike.  One of my favorite dystopian movies, accurately portrays where this generation is headed with all the video-based distractions we have at every turn in every room, restaurant, bar, and our pockets.  No one will feel the need to live a real life anymore at this rate.  I say we have the Bruce Willis national holiday where no video stimulation is allowed for one week.  A must see for all kids born after 1995 who haven't left the house in weeks.  Should be mandatory in schools..  Nevermind &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; or &#34;Animal Farm&#34;.

B005MMY534|3.0|There is profound drama in this series and that would be the one positive feedback I can provide. However, it does not measure up to the intense story plot, fantasy, magic, special effects and pageantry that surrounded the Merlin series. Where is the magic...where is the pageantry?...where is the integrated fantasy and fiction?...where is the beauty of the filming location, i.e., castle, panorama, etc.?

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is absolutely beautiful. It's somewhat like the PC version and the Mojang developers are become a little bit quicker with their updates as we have 0.8.0. around the first week of November. My only problem is that Amazon takes too long to approve updates from Mojang. I wish that this process would speed up a little more. But other than that, beautiful job Mojang~
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I did return mine which I bought hoping to be wire free and able to mirror iPad on my TV. That's what it looked like on product page/advertisement/on all gadget review blogs I read).<br /><br />I didn't realize that<br /><br />1. it needed brick adapter plugged into power outlet.<br />2. it can only cast certain apps (only two Netflix and Youtube at that time)<br />  2a. Netflix using Chromecast won't auto play next episode. I had to exit from current episode, select the next one from the list to watch next.<br /><br />BTW, it is not plug and play like it is still written on product page. (It's very easy setup but not plug and play).<br /><br />If someone asks me what one feature Chromecast perform better than any other device is or feature only Chromecast have? I don't have an answer. I mean if it is same wire clutter and have Netflix with less feature, why would I need it? I already have ps3/tivo/pc connected to my TV. It does not perform better than any other product I have, worse it took up the USB slot on my tv. I give 2 start for stream image quality which is great.<br />(Bought from Best Buy).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is bright and colorful, fast moving and fun.  I do not usually play games, and I think I will ask my grandson to help me increase my score!
0743270754|5.0|Wonderful book. Much better than a very good movie was.  Getting to know the character in greater depth add to the<br />Pleasure
B00594XOZU|3.0|I used to use kik fine and now it won't let me log in anymore. Kik was made for mobile devices and they haven't been focusing on Kindles. Maybe the app will be fixed one day. (3 stars because it's an amazing app but I can't use it on the Kindle Fire)
B0020BUWX2|5.0|It was a really good book, I'd read it again for sure. I love the flashbacks in it, it made me feel like I was a part of the book.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|I didn't have high expectations when I went to see this film. The newspaper reviews were indifferent- a quick &#34;Cars&#34; knockoff to keep Disney's cashflow up.<br /><br />But I was very pleasantly surprised. The story was a bit predictable - &#34;local boy makes good&#34;, the crusty old codger who eventually warms up and helps the kid and finds personal redemption for the errors of his past, etc- but I'd say it worked pretty well.<br /><br />I know enough about historical aircraft- and aircraft in general- that I appreciated the different planes that were shown in the movie. Thought there were some really interesting choices- the DH88 for example, voiced by John Cleese, the Corsair, by Stacy Keach, and of course a Gee Bee racer, by Carlos Alazraqui. There were enough 'in-jokes' that I was laughing out loud (but according to the kids, I was the only adult laughing...)<br /><br />I also remember Dusty and Ishani, flying near the Taj Mahal and observing graceful glider- like birds.... lovely image, clever replacement of animals from the &#34;Planes&#34; world to replicate nature.<br /><br />Had this film come out BEFORE &#34;Cars&#34;, I can't help but think it would have got a lot of praise for its animation, technical references, and possibly even its plot. Is it a bit too derivative of &#34;Cars&#34;? Maybe, but &#34;Cars&#34; was a difficult film to top- look at the reviews its sequel got.<br /><br />As a film for kids- and adults with an interest- I'd give it 4 stars.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a really fun game and you can't stop thinking about it... nice way to spend your free time! :-)
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. I have always enjoyed this movie from childhood until adulthood. Highly Recomended!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I was required to read this book for my English class, but I am so glad I did. It was a great read, beautifully written, and my jaw dropped more than once. I have recommended this book to just about everyone that I have come across. Definitely added to my list of favorites.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Totally absorbing from the first page.  Extraordinary characters, enchanting, absorbing.  I hated that it ended.  I found myself unusually moved by Alma's generosity to Prudence and again when she met with Wallace.  Don't know exactly why, just overwhelmed.  I didn't skip a page.  So well written so wonderfully researched.  I loved Alma Whittaker.  I love Elizabeth Gilbert's mind.
B002VWNIEA|4.0|First of all, the DVD itself was fine and in good condition and was able to play without any issues.  The subtitles weren't quite a verbatim match, but I watched without them and it wasn't too big a problem.<br /><br />The movie was great.  Denzel Washington's performance was top-notch, and Ethan Hawke held his own as well.  The plot itself was a bit over-the-top at times, but was definitely a fun ride.  It got a bit formulaic in the interactions between Hawke's and Washington's character, but some unexpected twists kept it going.<br /><br />Overall, a good buy.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The came is colorful, & fun. No real challenge, but entertaining anyway. Does have it's share of glitches, though. Can be a bit frustrating when trying to interact with &#34;neighbors&#34;, & staying connected. The best part is not being hounded to buy something to continue playing, as with many of the games available for the kindle fire.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Nice character development with some surprises.  Very different than his &#34;usual&#34; roles.  Enjoyed the movie and found it thought-provoking.  Recommend.
B001ET5X8K|5.0|The Band at it's peak recording one of the best albums of the 20th century. This is a very nice vinyl edition that gives these great songs an added warmth and sound.  Beautiful harmonies floating above a funky rhythm section anchored by Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. It is hard to imagine a more collaborative effort in spite of every song being credited to Robbie Robertson.
B00BIPMGD0|5.0|I'm adicted to the show.  I guess it is both the characters that are being developed and the legal cases they have to deal with.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Makes you focus to find objects, I like that, yet not irritatingly difficult. Very nice game, no frustrations. The touch screen works on one tap...no beating the screen to make it work.  I would recommend this game.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|tried to install several times deleted all of my others apps will not install don't waste your time. total junk. stinks
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is more fun than expected!  I keep coming back to it!  It's a simple search and find game, but has an interesting story.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Well I was really looking forward to this one. I enjoyed it and it was an easy read.  But it is not what I call up to King's level.  I usually LOVE everything he writes.  This was good, but not great.  If you want to know what happens to the little boy in The Shining, it's worth it.  Also, I think some of it is King stuff - the alcoholics anonymous seems gratuitous in many places.
B00DWAFB2C|3.0|The album is nothing special. A couple of pretty good songs and the rest is forgettable B-side material. I can see that most of the positive 5 star reviews will be coming from die hard Pearl Jam fans. I like the band but trying to be objective I can not justify anything higher than 3 stars.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well, I'd read this when my son was in middle school - to make sure he was reading it, and he picked it up again 4 years later and read it.  It is the ONLY book he has willingly ever read.  I must say I didn't remember how good it was. Some plot holes of course as it is sci fi, but still very good insights from a kid POV.  It made me read Ender's Shadow which I think is even better, a companion book about another character in this one.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|It was funny mysterious and always kept you wondering what kind of trouble she would get  into near future is
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love it. It's angry birds, it's Star Wars, what's not to love. We play all day and night. So fun!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|Couldnt even watch the whole thing. it kept glitching and froze up the entire time. toi bad it seemed ik till then
