B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is an old fantasy movie any age can watch.  David Bowie plays the goblin prince and his songs are great.

B008PZZV8S|5.0|The lead actors are so young and so terrifically accomplished in this well directed tale (overwrought in a way that's probably true to the original novel) of psychological suspense.
B006517W3G|5.0|Love Amy Winehouse, her music and this album is superb. The original songs, and new covers are absolutely awesome. Thumbs up!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater and liked it so much that I decided to add it to my collection.  Can't beat the visual effects and it has a great plot.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I downloaded this app so I could get songs on my kindle without purchasing them. This is exactly what it does. You can also download videos which is great. Overall great quality.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I love this movie, Johnny Depp is awesome, and this is classic tim burton. you do see some familier faces from their other movies but it's to be expected at this point. The movie is dark, but funny. If your looking for a remake of the old tv series, look elsewhere, but this is a great movie all the same.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This was a great movie.  There are some very sad scenes with another horse dying and battles so you might not want to watch it with very young children.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I would never have found the program without Amazon Prime, but am really enjoying watching it from the beginning!  Thanks, Amazon.
B003B17YZE|5.0|Jimi Hendrix lives up to every inch of hype. Particularly, the 15 min jam session on Voodoo Chile, which takes the listener through a quick tour of the previous 50 years of blues music. Add in a solo session or two for each of the highly talented back up artists (particularly Steve Winwood on the Organ) and the song becomes, (for me), worth the cost of the entire album. Add in the more famous Voodoo Chile (slight return) and All Along the Watch Tower, and the album becomes his most famous. And there are tons of more tracks to explore.<br /><br />Not that I needed to tell anyone about Jimi and the quality of his work. I just want Amazon to stop sending me notifications.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is a great story about finding and believing in yourself, as well as friendship. And while i do admit I was first attracted to this movie because of Hugh Jackman's line, &#34;I'm a bunny.&#34; The movie and it's cast were wonderful, and not quite what you would expect from the &#34;classic&#34; set of characters. I loved it and would recommend it to families and adults alike.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|This is a great movie.  There are some violent scenes in it though and I would not recommend it for children under 13.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was already on with this, but needed it for my iPod and iPad. It is one of the better ones to use.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|You need to have an open sense of humor to appreciate this move. Very scatological and dark. But hilarious. It's my kind of movie. They must have had fun making this flick.
B00026ZG10|5.0|This movie is an action classic with plenty of comedy as well. I have always loved it, and you can't beat the price.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|really enjoying the action you get just going place to place<br />and the fighting along with the skills &amp; weapons,  etc.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Beware of weird people. You may pick someone thinking they are safe but they might not be. Otherwise , tweeting is fun.
B000003GBN|5.0|Agree with all of the 5 star ratings, to which I add my own.  These are robust, dramatic but not overwrought performances that stand the test of time.  Brilliant interpretations, expertly played and recorded almost to the standard of Mercury Living Presence. I would urge those other reviewers gushing over Carlos Kleiber's and Herbert von Nazi's performances to have a listen to Osmo Vanska's well received recent Beethoven cycle with the Minnesota Orchestra.  I think you will be amazed, and add it to the short list of greats.

B00005K9LN|5.0|One of the first of the NWOBHM bands, the Priest deliver raw, straight ahead power riffs with equally pounding lyrics. A great album, if not the Priest's best, starts off with the classic singles &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; and &#34;Living After Midnight. The album sealed Judas Priest's status as genre icons, and kick-started heavy metal's glory days of the 1980s. It combines uptempo slices of metallic mayhem throughout the album but it also does not deviate from its past.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie was great for all ages. This was great because it's new and original. Many movies now are just remakes of an Older movie. But this was cute, some kid action with a good meaning. Kids say &#34; everyone should see this movie because it is funny with a good amount of action!&#34; kids give it two thumbs up each child.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great start to a large series. Sometimes sanderson's writing bothers me, I do not think he is as mature as some writers, but that did not detract from the thoroughly engaging and complex world he has created in way of kings. Parts of this book were very exciting and I found myself saying &#34;one more chapter&#34; quite often.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Okay I know a lot of people have doubts about High School Romance books, but this was something else. It's set in the 80's AND the main guy is a hot Korean. That's cool, right? Okay, just the hot Korean guy then. This book... This book was EPIC.<br /><br />I really really really really loved this book. The writing was so good. Funny, clever, romantic, exciting,... I really felt what the characters felt and I loved with them, cried with them, laughed with them... I loved the fact what holding hands for the first time did to Eleanor and Park. They were so cute together and by the time I was halfway through the book, I was just waiting for them to kiss and when they did, I just melted and was trembling the whole time for the rest of the book. And then I cried and cried and cried... And then I was confused. Seriously. I have no clue how this book ends, the last chapter was just soooo confusing.<br /><br />I love how the relationship between Eleanor & Park grows. You can practically see them falling in love and you just can't not love them. You just have to love them. Just have to. I loved Park. For some reason when I first imagined how he would look, Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender, came to my mind. Without scar that is. Don't know why. He just did. And Eleanor is so cool and different and not the stereotype perfect-looking skinny girl. I like a girl with a little meat on her bones. YEAH! Go Eleanor! You rock! Plus, red hair... Duh, that's just awesome. I love this. But still, confused about the end.<br /><br />So that's what I think of this. I want to thank TT for recommending this awesome book. Just another book for my best-books-ever shelf. For those who haven't read it yet, I highly recommend you do.

B0067EKYS6|2.0|This has to be the worst movie I've seen in years. I am well aware of the dangers of making films from classic novels; however, some directors pull it off. (I'm thinking now of \\"The Dead,\\" \\"The Remains of the Day\\" and \\"The Day of the Locust,\\" to name three.)  Mr. Luhrmann's efforts--  sadly--  do not capture the essence of the novel while standing on its own as a successful work of art. I am amazed that the director of \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" one of my favorite movies, is responsible in large part for this disaster.<br /><br />Where to begin? The three main characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) and Carey Mulligan (Daisy) are hopelessly miscast. (That doesn't leave much to save the movie.)  To be asked to believe that Gatsby would pine for five years for the character played by Mulligan is simply absurd. Maguire, on the other hand, may be the most miscast. He, in a word, plays himself. At times,  furthermore, I thought the director was trying to produce an epic with all those crowd and party scenes a la \\"Doctor Zhivago.\\" And the scenes shot around the service station look like a war zone. What on earth was that all about I ask. And did fashionable men from this period wear skinny-legged suits? Does anyone remember the wardrobe from the 1970's version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow? At least that movie got that much right.<br /><br />I kept hoping this interminable film (over two hours long) would get better. It did not. Maybe (I thought) the appearance of Gatsby's father would add a tad of pathos to this runny West Egg, but he did not show. (Since surely every high school graduate in this country has been required to read the novel, I do not believe I am offering much of a \\"spoiler,\\" as they say.)<br /><br />I kept looking for something to like about this movie as I checked  my watch often. The opening and closing credits are rather good, and occasional lines from Fitzgerald's novel reminded me of the reason it has become a classic, not enough, however, to justify spending money and, more importantly, two and a half hours of my precious life watching this Titanic. A Merchant Ivory production back in the day or Ang Lee perhaps could have made a fine movie from one of the great American novels but not this director.<br /><br />I hear that Messers Luhrmann and DiCaprio are thinking of making yet another movie of \\"Hamlet.\\" Surely they are not serious.a classic, not enough, however, to justify spending money and, more importantly, two and a half hours of my precious life watching this Titanic.

Its a great game, I personally highly recommend it and its definitely wprth the $0.99 no doubt!

0743487583|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />(Note: this review is for publisher Simon & Schuster's \\"enriched classic\\" edition of this book)<br /><br />\\"Published [anonymously] in 1818, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's \\"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus\\" is a model for Gothic fiction, science fiction, and all the horror novels that followed it.  Weaving the Gothic elements of the supernatural, terror, anguish, and love with the Romantic values of nature and individualism, Shelley delivers a chilling tale about unchecked ambition and the consequences of disturbing the order of nature.  Generations of scientists, ethicists, psychologists, feminists, and artists have been inspired and riveted by Mary Shelley's dark story.\\"<br /><br />The above comes from the supplementary (or \\"enriched\\") materials found in this book that contains the \\"complete and unabridged\\" enduring classic novel by Mary Shelley (1797 to 1851).<br /><br />The structure of this book has front supplementary material (a superb introduction, chronology of Shelley's life and works, and an important historical context of the novel) and back supplementary material (very important notes or glossary, interpretive notes which includes an overview of key themes in the novel, excerpts from critics of the novel, discussion questions, and a suggested book and film list).  Sandwiched between this front and back supplementary material is the unforgettable novel itself.<br /><br />This is not mentioned in the table of contents but the novel in this book is flanked by a preface (written by Shelley's husband who drowned in 1822) and an introduction to the edited third edition of this novel (written by Shelley herself in 1831).<br /><br />Thus, the structure of this book with no detail is as follows:<br /><br />Front supplementary material, preface, the novel proper, introduction, back supplementary material.<br /><br />On the back cover of this book it has the phrase \\"enduring literature illuminated by practical scholarship.\\"  You'll have to read the novel to find out exactly why it has endured since 1818.  What I can say is that the novel is \\"a timeless, terrifying tale of one man's obsession to create life--and the monster that became his legacy.\\"  (By the way, the Frankenstein movies that you may have seen bear little resemblance to the actual novel.)  It is the concise supplementary material that is the practical scholarship which illuminates this novel.<br /><br />This book is part of the \\"Enriched Classics\\" series which has good, helpful supplementary material.  This series includes such titles as \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" \\"Great Expectations,\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there were only two things that irritated me with respect to this particular book:<br /><br />(1) On the cover page it states that the \\"supplemental material [is] written by Margaret Brantley.\\"  Who's Margaret Brantley?  We're never told.<br /><br />(2) We're not explicitly told the edition of the novel that's in this book.  (Through doing my own research, it seems it is the original 1818 edition.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this is truly a great work of literature that, as a bonus, is enhanced with helpful notes and insightful commentary.  I guarantee that after reading this book, you will know the REAL story of \\"Frankenstein!\\"<br /><br />(published 2009; supplementary materials published 2004;  novel first published 1818;  introduction;  chronology of Mary Shelly's life and work;  historical context of the novel; preface;  the novel \\"Frankenstein;\\"  Mary Shelley on her novel;  notes;  interpretive notes;  critical excepts;  questions for discussion;  suggestions for the interested reader;  350 pages)<br /><br />(novel \\"Frankenstein\\" in 4 letters and 3 parts or 23 chapters; 270 pages)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXd the novel to find out exactly why it has endured since 1818.

B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Canada, according to the critics, is the long-awaited novel by Richard Ford.  Personally, I wish he had waited a bit longer.<br />I have always loved coming-of-age stories, the author dropping clues along the way as to how things will play out in adulthood, making the hero the man he will become. But in this rather stodgy, overwritten book, the end result just doesn't seem worth it.<br /><br />We follow the story of Dell Parson and his family in Montana - ex-Army father, frustrated mother and twin sister - as the parents plan to rob a bank, are caught and sent to jail.  Berner, the sister, takes off never to be seen again and the boy is sent north, hence the title.  Exciting plot?  Not so much.<br /><br />I like a book I can't put down but this was one I simply felt obliged to finish.  Dell is such a worthy boy I felt I owed it to him. He examined people so carefully, worked so hard and was so alone that I couldn't ignore him, though I really wanted to.  I reccommended this to my book club and expect to apologize at the next meeting.
B00CATSONE|5.0|In this age when we are consumed with mere survival and the present, it's refreshing to the spirit to think of creativity,imagination and nonconformity as valued concepts.<br />This book should be required reading in every high school.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|If you're not a horror buff then you'll probably rate it more like 2 stars.  There are are a few points when the action is over dramatized and the acting is even corny but like I said.. cheesy yet a little frightening.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|A great story with lots of twists and turns.  It has a soul. I highly recommend it and can't wait for the next book.
193700788X|5.0|I have read the book twice through since I bought it on tuesday and have to say I loved it! Having followed the adventures of Sookie I have to say the story ( while it did have some nit pick issues) ended it the only way it could. It was also great to see several characters reappear for Team Sookie and offer their help and support. Thank you Ms. Harris for 13 wonderfully diverting books to make my day better. On a side note: for the \\"fans\\" that are making death threats to the Author, Get a life, this is a work of fiction,enjoyable yes, but still fiction. These characters are Ms. Harris' and if you don't like how it ended, write a fan fiction for yourself. We would not have Sookie, Eric, Bill, Sam, Jason, Alcide, ect without Ms. Harris. These are her stories that she shared with us and I for one am very grateful!

006114665X|3.0|I generally enjoyed Mr Clark's voluminous attempt to answer the questions regarding the origins of WWI that have remained partially controversial for a century. However, on a topic I am somewhat familiar with, I found some of his conclusions fallacious, and based on false premises that result from looking at the \\"Young Bosnia\\" movement thru a biased point of view, hardly different from that of the imperial Austro-Hungarian official position at the time.<br /><br />Mr. Clark compares the \\"Young Bosnia\\" resistance movement to contemporary Al-qaeda...a bizarre analogy at best, considering the facts that \\"Young Bosnia\\" membership included members of Serbian-Orthodox as well as Croatian Catholic and Muslim faiths, whose common interest at the time assented in liberating their native lands from the Austro-Hungarian occupation; Ivo Andric, a Bosnian Croat and later Nobel Laureate held membership in the organization as a youth; furthermore, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand died while conducting imperial policy in a foreign occupied territory - he was not assassinated in Vienna.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the validity of Mr Clark' interpretation of other events analyzed in the book, though having the above in mind, I remain open to hearing discordant critique of his work.

030758836X|3.0|OK, who hasn't thought of getting back at your spouse?  Two thirds of the way through this novel the story became too wearisome, tired.  Who cares about the missing wife----and who cares about the husband, just get it over with.  Hard to believe this novel maintains a best seller spot week in and week out.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|I have not read the book.  It wasn't required reading in my small Texas Panhandle high school.  The reviews were bad, so I  went not expecting much of the Baz Luhrmann production.  At two hours and twenty-some minutes it looked to be too long by half.  Also, neither Leonardo DiCaprio nor Tobey Maguire are favorites of mine.  So I was pleasantly surprised to be totally intrigued, entertained, and even touched by the film and its story of two deeply flawed characters and their tragic tale.  I found DiCaprio (Gatsby) and Maguire (Gatsby's friend Nick) to be quite satisfying in their roles as was Joel Edgerton (Daisy's husband Tom) who was new to me.  I was already sold on Carey Mulligan (Daisy) from her role in Drive.  The big party scenes at Gatsby's reminded me of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge but it didn't distract from the overall flow of the film.  The dramatic scene in the hotel room with Daisy, Gatsby, Tom, Nick, and Jordan was the high point of the film and Nick as narrator worked splendidly.  Definitely worth seeing.

B0034G4P80|5.0|The movie was a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it :) The price was great and worth the condition of the product.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I think delerium is a fantastic book it has a great storyline, characters and description. I really love it and I would definitely recommend it to others
B007REV4T8|5.0|James Bond is misogynist and heteronormative.<br />Layered with racial and class stereotypes.<br />Skyfall is neither cleverer nor more sophisticated than its predecessors.<br /><br />And so on and so forth!<br /><br />Q: Age is no guarantee of efficiency.<br />Bond: And youth is no guarantee of innovation.<br />Q: Well, I'll hazard, I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.<br />Bond: Oh, so why do you need me?<br />Q: Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.<br />Bond: Or not pulled. It's hard to know which in your pajamas.<br /><br />I can recommend Roger Ebert's review  “... I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating...”<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />Skyfall is an exhilarating combination of new and old which remakes the franchise while somehow coming full circle and putting Bond back where he began proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the way Bond and M had to battle suggestions of both people and institutions being &#34;too old&#34; and &#34;outdated.&#34; M's speech quoting Tennyson is nothing short of genius and it captures exactly the uncertainties of our age.<br /><br />“Though much is taken, much abides; and though<br />We are not now that strength which in old days<br />Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br />One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br />Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br />To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”<br /><br />The movie is unashamedly positive about the necessity of defending and loving Britain. This is a Bond movie you should see if you have the slightest interest in the franchise. And if you do not, perhaps you will enjoy the soundtrack.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|This movie contains what seems to be two standard components of most movies today:  1) flawed characters who display immature, even aberrant, behavior, even at 40+ years old and whom we're supposed to sympathize with and/or smile at; 2) glorifying characters who act on every emotion they have, particularly if it contributes to their happiness.  This is probably a case of art imitating life, and of course, Hollywood will put a romantic spin on it.  However, I'm so sick of this propaganda and lack of originality that I've stopped going to the movies and pretty soon, I'll be forced to just stop watching new movies altogether. In that this movie was nominated for an academy award (and Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for portraying a less-than-challenging part), I think I'm making the right decision.<br /><br />I could tear this movie apart, but I don't want to take the time. I'll just point out two annoyances:<br /><br />1) Why is Nicki's affair shrugged off as if it is nothing?  Why is the movie presenting Pat as the nutty one for beating the crap out of a man he finds in the shower with his wife?? Sorry, but I don't find that reaction strange. I think many men would react similarly at finding some man boffing his wife in their own shower! Pat is certainly portrayed as unstable, but that act is not what makes him so.  The movies seems to be trying to portray Nicki as the victim to Pat, when it's just the opposite. Why is her affair treated as of no consequence?<br /><br />2) What's the deal with Pat whispering something in Nicki's ear at the end that the audience cannot hear and never finds out about?  Ever since Lost In Translation (which was a far superior movie), this whispering something the audience cannot hear has caught on, and now when it's used, it's just contrived.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I had been eyeing this book for quite some time but to be honest I was a little creeped out by it. When I finally picked it up I was pleasently surprised by the fun and exciting story!!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|While the kids today seem to like this game (my granddaughter is very good), it is not the type of game I like to play. I like games that challenge my mind, not my dexterity.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This digitally remastered House of Cards trilogy, adapted by Andrew Davies from Michael Dobbs' best-selling novel, centers on the machinations of Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson), a politician who, after being denied a Cabinet post by the newly installed Prime Minister, ruthlessly schemes his way to power, pulling the strings of British politics while destroying the many players around him one-by-one.<br />Richardson is perfect in his icy, urbane portrayal of the Machiavellian Urquhart, as is the entire cast, and the miniseries should be embraced as one of the enduring classics of British television.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Decided to make this Saturday movie with friends. Everyone loved it. I had my reservations,as I have read the books. After the first five minutes, forgot about any differences. I am a Tom Cruise fan and was not disappointed. Other watchers had not read the books and loved it. All of us hoped there will be more of this franchise.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The controls are so easy. The best part it is free .I wold download it because you will have so much fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This particular version of Spider is challenging enough for the experienced player.....yet easy enough for a beginning player. It is a fun game for all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A book is written that finds a part of you that you went aware existed. It's hard to believe that someone you've never met can have the ability to extrapolate these feelings out of you with the simple written word. However John Green seems to have such an ability in A Fault in Our Stars, as I have never felt so happy to be quite so sad.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was a solid ending, with plenty of cameos. I enjoyed the series {even when it seemed to falter} and will likely begin the series over again over the summer!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a good movie for all ages.  Watched this with my daughter and we both found it to be really good.
0972169504|5.0|If you are in college or starting grad school, you will love this book! It's easy to relate to it.<br /><br />Aaaand prepare for ironic jokes like you've never seen before!
B009NH9IMM|5.0|Best version of the Nightmare on Elm Street films to date.  Excellent transfer and top notch sound.  Highly recommended by me.
B00C3V5TTQ|4.0|i came for helen of troy and i stayed for the album. such a cute album. future album for lovers of the 80s.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I liked it because I can get better upgrades more easily than previous versions. That is all I have to say about the product.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I  LUV the birds and the Friends version is my favorite each week I have participated in the tourneys and I can't wait for new ones every week!!!!!! sometime winning sometime loosing yet it keeps me challenged keep on keeping the birds in their quest to keep the pigs in their place!!!  BLOWN AWAY  I also engage in the other games and I think I have all of them on my Kindle so where I  go The BIRDS are with me!!!!!! THANX for the distraction on some days!!! one last thing my playmates are old friends and even my niece and my cousin who always seem to pull ahead of me on some levels!!  LUV THE CHALLANGE  GEMMA R  xoxoxo
B009CVELHG|5.0|This is a marvelous movie with such incredible actors who render magnificent ensemble performances together!  Greta Garbo looks stunning-so does Joan Crawford.  This is one of the best film EVER made!
B000PMLFRA|3.0|The rights to the original trilogy are, interestingly enough, not owned by George Lucas or Disney (now that they have acquired Lucasfilm). The original trilogy is actually owned by 20th Century Fox. They are the ones who can determine whether or not the original, unaltered trilogy should see the light of day on Blu-Ray.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs does Memphis blues the way they need to be done!!!  Awesome and will recruit any listener to a diehard Boz fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS APP IS SO GOOD GET IT GET IT GET IT. there is also some epic cheats that work too, the most recent one is MCPE launcher. get that too. warning, this app is super addicting
B0040Y7EME|5.0|The  La Scala ballet company renders a magnificent interpretation of Swan Lake.<br />THIS VERSION IS ONE ANY LOVER OF SWAN LAKE SHOULD OWN!  It has a happy end!  I loved it!.  The  principal ballerina in this version is CONSISDERED THE BEST INTERPRETER OF THIS ROLE.  SHE INTERPRETATIVELY BEATS THE MARINSKY RUSSIAN  PREMIER BALLERINA LOPATKINA the roleby a notch or two!!!!!  Also, the principal violinist of La Scala  opens the beginning stanzas so beautifully. He is magnificently expressive in his playing.<br /><br />BUY THIS VERSION-YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  .
B002RT85RW|4.0|I purchased these and they took some time to be delivered because they were shipping from Japan. They came all intact even after the box was not in great shape. I also notice they were not packaged that well and should of been. But so far so good they have worked while backing up different types of media. But BEWARE of Blu-Ray disc being shipped from over sea's? The Chinese have made blank disc that are counterfeited and they DON\\"T WORK. I learned this the hard way with a set on Blu-ray DL's. They will ship from Japan as well so read the reviews..
0143122916|5.0|I heard about this book on the radio and bought it for an avid reader she said that she loved it that it was very informative, and that it was the type of book that once she started reading it she couldn't put it down.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It is very good for taking notes in class or for grocery shopping. It is the best app on the kindle for taking notes. I highly recommend it!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|i love maiden. i listen to at least one maiden song every day. i have done this for more than three years now. this is a great DVD. the concert footage looks very clear for being recorded in 1988.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|This movie was thoroughly enjoyable. Tremendous acting, marvellous story and sufficient quirkiness to make it so watchable.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is excellent and Brad Cooper can be viewed as an actor with an ability to deliver serious roles. Great support cast that helped demonstrate the quirkiness and messiness of family life.<br /><br />Great cinema and one so worth watching again and again.
0062101897|5.0|Any harry potter fan will love this book.  Amazing content with beautiful photos and illustrations. The cover is very nice as well but binding could be stronger.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Once again, the ability to see a full musical on video is great.  So many can not get to the West End (of London) or Broadway, and are missing a part of musical history.  If more could watch these wonderful shows, maybe the norm of what they call &#34;good music today&#34; would not be rap, but something requiring more talent.
B002RI97KC|2.0|The book is well written, but is misleading. I was among the Jews that were rescued to Sweden from Denmark in 1943, Arendt writes half of the Jews stayed hidden in Denmark, this is absolutely not true. This is just one fact, that I know about for sure. 20 members of my family did not come back from the holocaust, I have their last letters, I have read hundreds of accounts, Arendt does not know what she talks aboutm she accuses the victims and excuses Eichmann. Arendt is clever, arrogant, she was a zionist, but stopped being one. I saw the movie Hannah Arenst twice to try to understand her, read this book twice to understand her point -<br />If you read the book, it has to be with a critical eye, there is much information, but also much misinformation, disinformation, and misinterpretation.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Anthony and Helen  was great. Anthony made you think he was Hitchcock will have to add it to my dvd colletion.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|I have been anxiously waiting the release of Season 2 of American Horror Story, my only reservation was that they could not compete with [[ASIN:B005SZADQS Murder House: Pilot [HD]]] fantastic character selection.<br /><br />I am glad to say that Asylum had met and bypassed Murder House in character quality and depth. [[ASIN:B009SJ47XA Welcome to Briarcliff [HD]]] introduced a huge selection of characters that I am eager to learn more about. This episode alone convinced me to buy the whole season.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|this game is the best if you do not have it it right now so don't waste your time get it
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book for its entertainment purpose. The movie was interesting as well, but didn't follow some important storylines, which I thought was odd.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this one better because this game has different levels to play and it is more challenging to play! Keeps me alert and sharp!
B006FE83UE|5.0|I'm honestly super surprised by how cheap this is. I bought my copy and love it. My dad and I enjoy watching this movie together so I definitely looked into buying a copy. This was one of the first items I spotted and instantly got it. Very good condition and quality.
B009MO57H6|5.0|This is a great action packed movie. There is a lot of action in this movie enough for any action junkie.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Especially if you're from the Boston area, this is pretty funny. I think most people will find it amusing though. Some crude humor though, so be warned. There is a happy ending.
B000002KHF|5.0|Wonderful.  Only drawback is several tracks were hard to hear.  Had to turn up volume for these and lower volume for others.
B000SKNIWE|5.0|Picture quality was great!! Really showed off my new HD tv. DEF will recommend it to friends. This is the best!!
B000002KHH|4.0|This was cheaper than downloading songs. CD came in new condition in plastic CD case. Nothing else to say except if you are a Black Sabbath fan this is a great CD.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Well written and completely absorbing. Wish there were more than just these three. Sorry author is gone,
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|What can you say about the BEST rock and roll band of our lifetime? BRAVO, Baby...Bravo!!! This documentary is wonderful, with interviews and live concert footage. If you liked Farewell Tour 1 (?)ha-ha!, you'll love The History of The Eagles.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|It came early and I love it,haven't seen it but ppl say its the scariest movie of all time,so had to buy it
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|Within the first couple of episodes, Hannibal had become one of my favorite TV shows ever. Everything about this show is as beautiful as it is creepy and disturbing. The acting is a all fantastic, the writing superb and the design (set, costume, effects) is magnificent!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Silence of the Lambs, or crime shows like Dexter, CSI or Breaking Bad.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you love Tina Fey, you'll love Bossypants. It's funny as well as giving the reader a glimpse into her life.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|The best novel about Scarpetta that I've read in years.  I felt like I was in Kay's mind, seeing the myriad of paths that lead to her decisions.  Those brilliant thought processes were what made Scarpetta stand alone, from my view. Well done, Patricia Cornwell!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it is really fun but its can also be very challenging. this fame is very addicting, once you start a level u have to finish it.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I had a hard time choosing from all the cases from what people have posted as reviews. I have not taken my kindle outside the house yet but I like the color and the elastic band that holds it closed. It was really easy to put the Kindle in the case and it stays in place. So far I am glad I purchased this case. If I was a traveler I would probably pick a more durable case but for what I use it for, it is great. Very glad I chose this case.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down. I was gripped right from the beginning. Absolutely recommend this for an exciting read
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|A game that makes you think. Great pictures to make you have to think. Not too hard not too easy, just right
B005HSL626|5.0|it so much fun. i mean what could be more fun than choping FRUIT. the game is awsome. if i were you i would get it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Masterpiece Classic program Downton Abbey allows the viewer to travel back in time. I love watching as the characters develope. I also enjoy learning about different historical events and how people survived those times. If you long for simpler times this show will take you there. AMAZING!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|This Conan looks like the one Frazetta drew on the covers of the books, great casting.<br />I love the barbarian brutishness of Conan, the look in his eye is fearsome, and playfull at the same time
034580404X|5.0|Product arrived on time, it is the soft copy, good price! it is cheaper to buy the trilogy ....I can't wait to start reading it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love it!!!!! it is like the first one but there is alot more coins and there is only one ape chasing u. the characters that you can buy r alot cheaper. It is so fun once i start playing it i cant stop. :)
B009O2XY12|4.0|I really like this game!  However, I want a game like this where I do not run out of lives, energy, etc!
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|In my daily life I do lots of reading and having something that will translate all those books and documents into audio files is a big help. This app lets me enjoy listening to my work related papers as I travel.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Christina A surprised me. I knew she could sing, but she also did a believable job as a novice in L.A. The story had is slow moments, but I enjoyed it. Dancing was definitely different, but held your attention. As for Cher, I'm a big &#34;Moonstruck&#34; fan so anything she does is great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is soo much fun. once i start to play it i cant stop. it is soooo addictve. get the app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|VERY ENTERTAINING,HELD MY INTEREST CANNOT WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK AND SEE THE NEW MOVIE. SPELLBINDING AND THOUGH PROVOKING
B008NW67E0|3.0|I had high expectations for this album, but the recoding isn't very good. It would be nice to see mainstream recording artists put some care into their product.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I mixed up my reviews sorry. The one I wrote on the &#34;sound track&#34; should be here, for the movie. So here is one for the CD.<br />Love the music, Christina and Cher are fabulous.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|it is soo much like super mario brothers. some of the levels are super easy but others are hard i died like 10 times on the same level. lol. get the app.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app and use it all the time...I dont have a cell phone so this app is perfect for me if Im gonna fall asleep on the couch.  Plus I can use any music I have downloaded as the alarm which is also a big plus
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|I am a huge Woody Allen fan and have seen almost every movie he made (more than once). I believe that while not all his movies are equal in their quality, humor or sadness and pace, all of them are worthwhile. With that said there are amazing movies like Annie Hall, Love and Death, Vicky Christina Barcelona, Hanna and Her Sisters, Match point and very good ones like Whatever Works, You will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Midnight in Paris, Play It Again  Sam. In this movie, while its a very cute and enjoyable movie the typical flashback to his childhood, scenes of Woodies cute clumsiness and great one liners are slightly uneven and the character development and plot are slightly thin. However the use of Humphrey Bogarts character, coaching Woody Allen and his challenges in dating and his ultimate decision in his relationship with Diane Keaton's character (and she is terrific as always) is creative and fun and there are some very funny moments. this movie left  me with a smile at the end of this movie, which is always a nice feeling. To quote the late Rger Ebert: i give this movie a thumbs up.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I really like this movie, good scary. Ending could have been a little better, not what I expected.  Would recommend.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Sounded interesting for search.  Web sites are just way too slow on my tablet.  I can't see using it unless I get a faster tablet.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Not only did I get a great film with all the features I wanted, but I also got it at a great price!!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|title says it all. it deserves 0 stars because its a price of road trash. the increasing spawn time is ridiculous and its just a money pit.
1577314808|5.0|I don't know how my words can do this book justice. In just a short amount of time, applying the lessons in this book has utterly transformed my life for the better. I've significantly reduced the anxiety and depression that has plagued me all of my life, embraced the present, and gained more life satisfaction than I ever thought possible. And it all comes from within.<br /><br />This book will help you realize that you can do anything, that you don't need material items or even ideas to make you happy. I've been so much closer with friends, family, and loved ones since reading this book, and have actually been a lot more attractive to women, too.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|The movie followed the book about 60% but having recently read the book the details on the Detective husband was missing. The story line did vary a lot at the end. If I had not read the book I might have given it a 5 star for a love story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I.......uhhhh.......don't know what to say about this game because its the best app game you can get because instead of like the other games where you just sit there..mine craft helps you be creative and think so your mind never gets bored. whoever is reading this MUST GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW!!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|You know, I don't know how much of this is hype or true, but I could not stop watching.<br />Whatever side of the issues your on this is a great movie just for the movie's sake and I would watch it again.
0743490304|2.0|Story is very complicated and the author, apparently to confound the reader, keeps bringing in new information to throw you off the track.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This little alimport adapter does what it was meant to do and does so with ease.<br /><br />Setup is as follows: Connect it to your phone and plug in and HDMI cable from it to the TV. THAT'S IT!<br /><br />The phones screen is projected onto the tv in stunningly high definition and with virtually no lag!<br /><br />The slimport also had a micro usb charging port so you can charge your phone while using the slimport.<br /><br />It is very well-built and extremely useful- I highly recommend!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|the game was amazing, it was so good that I bought some extra gold coins to make the game more enjoyable, and right when I got to the final level the entire game and my kindle froze and it took me a week to be able to turn it back on again. I do not recommend this game
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Fans of a rough and tough McQueen know that the Thomas Crown Affair is his venture into playing a character totally opposite of what is expected. Great cars, interesting plot, and a beautiful Faye Dunaway lend this original the high ratings it deserves.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so amazing I always loved alpha minecraft  and now I can enjoy alpha once more. THIS GAME IS THE BEST THING EVER! I love it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I now have read all the Gillian Flynn books and would have a really hard time deciding which one I liked best..  The author does and superior job of creating characters and adding unexpected twists and turns thoughout the books that keep the reader enthralled until the last page.
B0024FAG5I|3.0|This movie had a lot of big names, it tried to be a classic, I love Hackman, Crowe is less than stellar, Stone isn't to great, etc.
1451629192|5.0|This young mother, without more than a 6th grade education ,wrote ythis book without a ghost writer, andf did a fabulous job from the heart. I grew up in the same town were this girl was being heald captive, mere miles away, and remember her name and picture on posters everywere. She is more than just a survivor, she thrives!
031603441X|1.0|The is the worst autobiography I have ever read. After reading half of it, I finally said enough. The main reason why this book is so horrible is that Keith offers insight into nothing. It is simply a book of name-dropping and I did this with this person in this place. Even in this capacity, he fails to make what he did interesting in any way, shape, or form. For example, he tells us that he partied with John Lennon and Yoko Ono. They must have had some interesting conversations, and Keith is in a position to offer us some insight into two interesting people. The best Keith can do is tell us that he found John lying on his bathroom floor because he had been vomiting and got sick. The purpose of this illustration of showing John at his worst is to show us what a man Keith is and that he could hold his drugs and outdo John as a party master - pretty juvenile. The whole book reeks of shallowness and juvenile boasting. It really made me think quite less of Keith as he shows himself to be just another shallow, egotistical, celebrity - such a shame. With age comes wisdom, they say. Apparently not for everyone.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I've enjoyed some of the other movies that Zooey has been in, so was interested in this show when it first came out.  I must say, I almost gave up on it after the first 1-2 episodes, as it was just a bit too cutesy for me.  However, I'm very glad I stuck through it, because after 3-4 episodes I was completely hooked!  I don't know if the main character got toned down a little or if I just got used to her, but that combined with the excellent supporting characters makes me look forward to every episode.  This is definitely one of my top three sitcoms of all time now, and I rarely get through an episode without laughing out loud several times.  Highly recommended.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|If you want to get the photo sync to work this is a must have i have no complaints at all.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Boring,  boring, boring! There is no real story line and the writing is not the best. Not sure why everyone was raving about it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old great grandaughter who loves anything with a princess. All I had was the Sleeping Beauty classic edition VHS tape & she has played it till she has wore it out. We  have to watch it at least 5 times a day. She is totally captivated by it & Snow White which will no longer play . Anything thats makes my baby so captavatingly happy I Love It.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|In general I guess I found the book to be OK.<br /><br />It was rather slow going at the start then picked up and really became a page turner for me...then slowed down again. For me there were too many technical issues in Wool which stretched the &#34;believability&#34; of the story too far. I really never got over the issue of a society able to engineer massive electrical generators, mining operations, hydroponics farms, plus all the ventilation and sanitation systems required to sustain a &#34;silo city&#34; bored hundreds of stories into the earth...and nobody every thought, or bothered to put in a freight elevator.<br /><br />I won't detail other technical issues that intruded on my embracing the premise of the book for fear of giving away too much information to those who haven't read the book yet, Perhaps I was just too picky about them to begin with, but they really did make the difference between Wool being an &#34;OK&#34; and &#34;fantastic&#34; book.<br /><br />Ron
B00006FDCD|3.0|...when I was a kid, it actually gave me anxiety about clowns in general, but being older I realize it's not about clowns or serial killers, but about facing your fears.<br /><br />I always have a problem though about how it seems 9/10 they take a great story from Stephen King and turn it into a crappy made for TV low budget movie.  There are some exceptions, but this was not it.  Being older and having a more refined view of films, this is not the way I would have handled shooting this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love the game, love puzzles and this is fun to do while waiting for an appoinment or just sitting around taking a break.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Wonderful book. Touching story. Love that the heroines of the novel found the love and bond of family with each other.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Got the BD to complete my collection.  At $12, this was a terrific price to pay to have the movie.
B000JLSM00|5.0|In film classes we would watch this over and over, it is a film to be studied for many many reasons and I wont get into it here.  A must see, they just don't make them like this anymore...
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Realistic and feasable, plenty of action and suspense.Couldn,'t put it down. Only one disagreement of strategy, why didn't we send in the Stealth fighters on the strike? Good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this was the best book because it had so much action. I couldn't stop reading it. I wish there were more books I could read like maybe a book about Katniss' s kids.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a good read. The ending seemed to try and wrap up things quickly. Thankfully I didn't have to wait to read the second book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So, I almost didn't read this book because there were a couple of reviews that I read that were not in favor of the book. Well, when I noticed that the book was on sale I figured why not give it a try! I am SOOOOO glad I did. I would have to say that this is possibly one of the best books that I have read. It gets to you right from the start. I mean you have Sky who is this sheltered girl that is home schooled and has only one friend that she met just 4 years ago, and then you have Holder (Swoon) who is SOOOO intense and passionate that he makes you heart melt (well, mine did anyway)! This book will put you through a plethora of emotions; anger, sadness, love, passion, happiness, and that is just to name a few. One minute you are laughing, the next you are crying, and then you want to throw you book across the room because you are angry. But, all of that is what makes this book so great. The way that she can pull out all of the emotions in you in just a few short hours from reading this book is incredible. This is the first book that I have read by Colleen Hoover and I can't wait to read the others. If the others are just as fabulous as this one then I know that I will not be disappointed. PLEASE DO NOT let any bad reviews about a book make you look at it differently. If I did I would not of read this one and now I am just wishing that I would have read this one sooner. I could not put it down! I have read over 100 books in since last summer and this one is definitely on my top 10 list!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app os fun. Kids teens and adults would like this app. Take this from an almost 13 year old. This app is great.
B0072OFM28|3.0|I am not sure about this one-  I don't know if it is the new Spartacus or this story line or both<br />I miss Andy Whitfield - he had passion - his face just exuded emotion while I find that Liam McIntyre just doesn't have it<br />and I am not sure of the story line - I realize that it has to move on but seriously Crixus - all that for one woman that you barely knew - only in fairytales -  anyways  lots of violence - sex,  some disturbing sadistic violence , more nudity and sex to the point that it is getting a bit tawdry - but that only takes me to the end of episode 4  -  as I said I am really not getting into this as much as the prequel and the first season -  however I will persevere and see it to the end -maybe it will grow on me -  more when I finish this 2nd season

B000FC11A6|1.0|I've read 45 pages and have encountered three separate groups that seem in no way connected.  The story is bouncing all over the place in apparently different time periods. A book is supposed to leave you enthralled in the first few chapters, but this one has just confused the hell out of me and I read it three times just to try to make sense of it. For the first time in my life I cannot finish a book I started. There is no apparent story.  Please if you've read this book, does a story ever develop?
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have a kindle fire and it downloaded and plays fine. The concept is amazing, you can never run out of things to choose from. I bought a world pass, but once I wasn't connected to WiFi I lost all the levels, but when I got home they were there. That just means they're WiFi only levels which I don't have a problem with. Great game.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a great game. I have to play it at least twice a day, because it is so fun. But, the only thing that I don't like are the commercials popping up when I'm not playing my game it is very annoying. Also can you please go back to subway surfers New York I wanna get the character, \\"Tony.\\" But other than that I love Subway Surfers and I hope you guys continue the world tour.

0061692034|2.0|Well, I know why I read it...it was for book club.  The writing style is unremarkable.  (This was my first Richard Ford book, and it'll be my last.) The main character/narrator is amazingly complacent and uninteresting.  He tells the story seemingly in a monotone.  I gave it two stars: one for the setting, and one because I finished it (although I don't really know why...oh, right, for book club).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have missed out on the end of many auctions because I was away from a computer where i could access EBay.  This ends that quandary!  I'm no 'ninja' but I've had much more success in winning the items I want thanks to this App!

B000YJ6736|2.0|He is a good writer, but this book is not a worthy example ofMcEwan's abilities.<br />The story is stunted and I found it rather depressing to witness such a total lack of communication, even in the Britain of the time.<br />The novel needed some further work.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Beautiful story, very well executed and lushly described.  A book that you won't be loaning to people, you'll just buy them their own copy.

B004TTHLBE|5.0|I can't believe that until about 6 years ago I had never heard if Neil Gaiman.  I saw the BBC version of Neverwhere and went to the library to get the book.  I've been reading him off and on and sharing with my great niece ever since.  AMERICAN GODS IS such s good read that I have recommended to people everywhere I went while I was reading it.  He is s wonderful writer.  You won't be able to put it down.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Mrs. McKenna gifted us with a truly poignant, heartwarming story. Her wonderful prose will make you laugh out loud , cringe in horror and cry, and make you feel warm and fuzzy all over as you read along. The main characteristics really come to life. iI found myself visualizing the various scenes as if I was watching them on a tv  or movie screen. There was lots of sadness, but an abundant dose of love and kindness, and down to earth ,genuine, uncomplicated, unconditional friendship. I will definitely be looking into more of this wonderful author's work. Thank you for a wonderful read!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love my kindle! Use it every day to read and check weather, Etc. the only drawback I see is cant hardly read it in the car its hard to see, this is when my hubby is driving. and cant get online in car.
193700788X|4.0|After reading the reviews I read before I got to the book myself, I was expecting to hate it - really hate it. It is a bit of a mad dash to bring many pieces together and perhaps tried to close too many things that had been sufficiently closed before, like Quinn, Alcide, Barry, Sam's mom, Newlin, Claude.<br />I was a True Blood fan before I read any of the books. I started reading the books when the 7th or 8th book was about to print and maybe the 2nd or 3rd season of the show had aired. I got hung up in my love for the books and the differences in the show before deciding to treat them like totally different things so I could enjoy both again. I still find myself seeing the characters from the show when I read the books and I have felt many times Ms. Harris wrote the later books with the tv versions of the characters in her head too - like Pam.<br />I do like Eric (and Alcide) and as much as I enjoyed their story they weren't going to make it long term. Regardless of all the other drama, Sookie loves her life and the sun too much to have stayed with Eric. Eric, just like Sookie realized herself, knew he would have lost her by turning her and as much as he loved her (he didn't turn her!) he knew the practical thing to do was to cut his losses, take the deal and make it as good as he could make it. Pam, Karin and Sookie were all right about him, I think. He knew Sookie would never be his in the way he wanted and he had a pretty appealing plan b plopped in his lap to soften the loss. Why else would he agree to leave all his people behind - so he could make forgetting easier.<br />I didn't feel there were crazy inconsistencies. Shifter minds were often explained as snarled with general emotional state getting through, though she often remarked she made a point to stay out of Sam's head. So I'm on the fence there. Did she and Quin have full intercourse? I thought I remembered they got real close but never got all the way there so I was confused about the condoms from Quinn in her drawer. I am a little surprised Nial would be so careless with Claude and that he'd take a chance with Sookie in that regard.<br />I'm also not surprised at Sam. I would have liked to see Alcide myself (because of my love for the character on the show) but that would have pulled Sookie into more drama where she could be exploited as the pack shaman and I just don't see book Sookie as pack master's wife. Sam is a logical choice. Wouldn't it be nice if every girl suddenly discovered her one solid best guy friend could also be her crazy exciting lover? Sam doesn't have a pack, he has a normal family who live far enough away not to be too much drama and they share some good history and live compatible lives. She could do much worse. I'd also thought about Remy and was less excited about him than Sam. Someone was very upset that she was so easy with Bill after he raped her in the car thanks to Debbie. However she dealt with that, it did seem that she had put that behind her and that she had interacted with Bill, even helped him since that time.<br />So, in the end I have to thank Ms. Harris for many enjoyable reading hours across the series and I can't wait to see what kind of crazy things happen on the show this summer.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I read this book years ago and also saw the movie. Yet, it drew me back again and I was SO glad I revisited it. A masterful story that made for a breathless conclusion.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wow word of Ang Lee.. truly amazes me.<br />This is one movie that I wish I had watched in the theater.
0843178140|5.0|I got this for my 4 yr. old granddaughter's birthday and she loved it.  Also got her Mr. Bump, and she already had Little Miss Oops.<br />They are such fun to read and she never tires of them.  Will be buying others for her.
B001FA0H3E|4.0|As usual...a surprise and abrupt ending. You can see it coming, but somehow the author makes it grab you nevertheless.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Awesome trilogy (yes all 3). Well worth what I paid. Looks great, and was fantastic to enjoy it with my kids.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game if you like bingo! Different boards keep it interesting and there is slots too. It does sometimes freeze though.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I love the new season of American horror story asylum. The characters are beyond incredible. Once you watch this fantastic show you will be forever hooked!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Celtic Woman... always great.  After seeing the Believe Live concert on PBS two years ago, I wanted this on DVD.  It was well worth buying!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The movie neither grabbed nor repulsed me, though it was difficult to enjoy with the ridiculous 'feats of reasoning' the Jack Reacher character accomplished.  As an action flick it lacked the fast pace I like.  There was one car chase that went unnecessarily long.  The fight scenes were good and the camera work was good as well.<br />  Overall it seemed like the script was custom made to stroke Cruise's ego.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not your standard &#34;who dun it?&#34;.  I enjoyed the different perspective.  Reminded me of the movie &#34;The Bad Seed&#34; made a long time ago.
1557420580|5.0|I adore it however I didn't expect it to be a large size (not thick) book. But I'm not complaining
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|We need more like this! Visually beautiful. Challenging but not frustrating. If you like puzzle boxes this game is for you.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I read the book before I saw the movie and there were a lot of things that were changed. The army does not use semiautomatic rifles for sniper rifles or at least they didn,t use to. My biggest fault with the movie was with Tom Cruse as Reacher. Reacher is suppose to be 6 foot 5. Most of the guys in the bar fight were taller then Reacher.
B0007TKNII|5.0|It is like watching it at a theatre. I just love the phantom of the opera in general. Cheers everyone!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't mind the ending, I just wish it was better executed.  There are a few plot devises that don't name sense, but this was a book I didn't put down until I finished it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I READ BOOK ONE SO I WANTED TO CONTINE TO READ THE COLLECTION.  VERY INTERESTING.  READING BOOK THREE RIGHT NOW.
B003WE9WRI|5.0|I loved the book.<br /><br />As someone who likes the idea of zombie games and movies it's simply fun to read the detail of how much needs to be done to survive in reality.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Cannot play it unless you are on facebook, how very social of the antisocial birds!!! insisting that you make friends
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really like Suzanne Collins' writing style. The book is adventurous, descriptive and addictive while quick to the point. She keeps you reading with end of chapter cliff hangers, to the point that it's made me late for work. The hunger games trilogy has so far been a phenomenal story. Katniss is one awesome character.
B008M87GJK|4.0|it is always good to see the news from other that American networks perspective plus better coverage of international news which get little or no attention in the network news.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|The trailer was the funniest part of this movie.  Sometimes I will get an R type movie if I think it is good, but the trailer is deceiving.
B000002VMD|5.0|I will always miss her beautiful voice and her beautiful face.  I will watch the movie again soon....Love her............forever and always............
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife was sick when we purchased this.  After watching Seasons 1&2 we had to see 3.  It was well worth.  Can't wait for season 4.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|The parallels of the advanced stage of progressive confiscation of individual liberty in favor of collective conformance between this depiction in 1949 and the culture and society of 2013 are eerie.  But just perhaps, it will awaken the human spirit to stand in resolve against this afront.  Well worth watching and considering.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Many twists and turns in this story until you finally out the story of Maggie's sister and niece and the \\"who done it.\\"
B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved the Sookie Stackhouse series when it started. The last 3 books have been odd. I hated this book. It just didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />(spoiler)<br /><br />It makes no sense that Sookie would want to date Sam at this point. Saving his life was a stretch. This was one of the most disappointing endings to a series that I've ever read. The characters in this book all acted outside of their expected personalities, especially Sookie.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie rocks as does the rest of the new batman series. I am a big fan and this is a must have if you are too.
B009NY43NY|4.0|All the favorites return for one last appearance.  Maybe now Sookie can have her own happily ever after.  Defiantly potential for spin offs.
B008602KQI|3.0|Never got to watch it. For some reason having 75 Mbp is too fast forAmazon. Amazon said my speeds were much too slow so I checked several speed tests, not one under 88 Mbp. Had an email saying call but I won't bother, it either works or it doesn't and by changing settings one of the other three services will likely stop working.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I am sorry, I just could not get into this book, nothing and no one seemed right.  I see that the author had to tie up all the ends to end this series, but way too bland.  Maybe it is better not to string a series too long.  It might have turned out better.
1419705849|5.0|All of these books are great for my son, who is not as interested in reading as his sisters were at age 9. They are light and have Lots of drawings in them.  It has been difficult to find things that he enjoys reading and I think these books are great for a non reader!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it. I have had it for a long. time.I can breed stuff.everyone should love it.I think it is worth 99 cents. Wait till I get to level 100. I can get all the dragons I want. But why is the air dragon worth 500 gems.
1419702238|5.0|My nine year old is not a reader like his sisters.  He does love these books so I get them as they come out. I like the fact that this one is a hard back and not paperback as I do not let him use an e reader. Great books for the non (not yet) reader!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Just like cut the rope, great for killing time and exercising the mind. Waiting for more levels and ad ons
B009GQ57ES|4.0|like almost all of the songs....like most of the lyrics though some not as creative as others...would be interested in more of their music
0307476073|1.0|wow. did all the postive reviewers actually read this book???? what a complete waste of money. i had absolutely no compassion for this character and her stupid irresponsible choices. mom is dying, she thinking about nurses penis? one sentence admission of abortion after sex with a heroin addict? a gross of condoms on a trecherous hike?  and the incessant whining.... please!  not surprising its an oprah pick...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really great game because it changes place and u can get cool people or great boards
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great story!  August Pullman is an inspiration!  The power of kindness is overwhelming.  I recommend this book for everyone, young and old.  It is a favorite of mine and my nine year old!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Liked the fact that a DVD was included with the Blueray, so the car player can play it for the kids.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Riveting, spellbinding, and ends with finality. These three books were difficult to put down and make you realize what a waste war is. Life should be cherished and we need to find a way to accept people for who they are. I am sad I am done as these were great stories to be immersed in.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Holy crow. Spare yourself. Who is this woman's editor and continuity expert? CH needed to pull an E.T. & phone home to get a much needed reality check instead of phoning it in.    First off, what a boring and trite send off to a once great series not that it surprises, the majority of people saw it coming. Who Sookie ends up being as a person at the end of this series actually makes this series utterly pointless.    However, my main gripe, the thing that REALLY sticks in my craw daddy is the fact that CH is crying about her fans and saying she won't tour because she received death threats? Are you kidding me??? What a beyond low blow for her cowardice.    I've heard she's accusing of being bullied. What are we 12? Bullying my behind. She has been caving to the pressure since selling out to Ball and the s**** show that was book 9.    I am astonished by her lack or respect and personal accountability for careless, sloppy and writing. She's been writing poorly and with little effort, she knows it & that's why she's in hiding. Period. Most of her fans are too astute to let it slide & that's why she's not touring.    CH wrote an overall piss poor end to the series (& when I say the end I mean the overall END not the WHO she ends up with). I think a lot of people are confusing that readers are disappointed about the end because she doesn't end up with Eric. That's not at all what most people are disappointed about when they say the end sucks.    Sure, they bring up Eric but that's because CH gave Sam ZERO context to warrant being the HEA. However, when readers say that this steaming pile of pooh is a disappointing ending, it's because for this final installment of the series to be the last book in Sookie's experience in misadventures is crazy.    Sookie starts worse than when she was at square one (at least at square one, in DUD, she's open to all of life's possibilities & extremities) so what has been the point? She is ineffectual, lobotomized, seems as if she is settling and more importantly, she came across as marginalized by her own creator. What a bad mommy. CH....bad, bad mommy.    The whole concept of this series has been entirely POINTLESS. That is what people mean by it being a disappointing end. It's like Sookie learned nothing and was a shell of herself....of all the potential she once held wasted. Where was the poignant learning? Under rug swept.    I mean for Sookie to say she always liked Sam & wanted to be with him but didn't want to ruin the friendship? Oh flipping hell.....what cop out. We're supposed to just buy that? That's like the really insecure girl (you may know the one) who dates anyone whose interested because she is fickle & desperate for attention but doesn't really believe she can hold onto the man she really wants. The one who stokes her passion, so she ends up with the safe 'best friend' who was always into her (probably her friends brother). Down deep, she knows he's not for her but to prove everyone wrong, she'll stick it out with him. It's lame, unbelievable & everyone knows it.    The book was a beyond ineffectual write off with ALL characters assassinated and lobotomized. I could give a pooh who Sookie ended up with because they all sucked, esp. Sookie. She sucked since book 9, got marginally better in book 10 & 11 but in book 12, she was awful. CH didn't nothing to redeem her main heroine. Instead she eviscerated the plucky, authenticity she once had and THAT is why the series resonated with readers.    I said it a million times before to friends, it didn't matter if Sookie ended up with a purple people eater as long as it made sense in the end and was well written with genuine effort instead of phoning it it in order to just get it over with.    It is SO, so clear CH forced that ending upon her readers because she tried sticking to her guns, not taking any accountability for what she created & wrote all throughout the trajectory. She created the monster (which she deems her fans & the characterof Eric) and because she was pressured not to kill Bill (& her fans sniffed that falsity out in a heartbeat), she decided she was going to stick to her guns for the HEA regardless if it flowed or if she gave it the proper context.    And THAT is the other real issue here in legitimizing the end of this series. Zero authentic context. That's just bad writing. Period.    She just wrote with amazingly sloppy broad brush strokes in order to rush us to the end because she couldn't handle the fame or pressure. She turned her disappointment with Ball & her lack of conviction in book 9 outward & thumbed her nose & chose to blame her readers instead of just putting her head down & giving something truly genuine.    I am really staggered how she threw out there numerous times now in interviews that she received death threats which is why she insinuated not touring. That comment has detoured the reviewers or interviewers to focus on the wrong thing...the fans instead of the inept writing.    It's obvious CH wants to go back to her little world of writing, no pressure and near anonymity. It's unfortunate she couldn't figure out a more graceful and dignified way of doing that.    Instead we have yet another author taking pot shots at her fan base as a deflection tactic because she knows she phoned that crap in.    I know she doesn't care & is relieved when her more vocal \\"fans\\" say this but never again....she's not worthy of my time or hard earned money.    All of this negative attention is 100% due to her and the fervor she willing perpetuated in order to sell(out), not her \\"crazy\\" fans. She needs to get a grip. I can't stand people who can't be honest enough with themselves in order to take personal accountability for their words, deeds & actions. Which not so coincidentally, is who Sookie ended up being. A person who deflects and sweeps it all under the rug as if it all never happened or mattered.    We're all better off taking a page from Stoopie's book and making a casserole.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|This book looked promising, but apparently, it wasn't edited, which made for an awkward read. I abandoned it a quarter-way through.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I downloaded this app to see if I can find a way to make my Kindle fire last longer than it does. I've only had it installed a short time and really haven't seen how it makes my kindle work any better. there are some good ideas in the program on how to extend the battery life most of them I am already using.
B002R88G5E|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of those books that draws you in completely. You'll emerge thoroughly outraged and emotional, but it's a journey worth taking.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I downloaded this product so that when I'm out and do not have a piece of paper handy I can open this app and make a short note. Usually the name of a book, author, telephone number or directions. So far it seems to do just what I need.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the different scenes and places. I think that the game should have been more original instead of mimicking temple run. For example the new implementation of the key is strongly related to the diamond redemption in temple run 2. I love the graphics and the game runs smoothly on kindle fire HD. I look forward to the growth of this game.if a suggestion would permissible, maybe adding more levels to increase the multiplier.<br />.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Different strokes for different folks .  Romance is fine but, is it not true real life is better. In my words the stoey happens everyday and not such a good ending
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Awesome Movie.  its one twist after another after another.  kept me on the edge of my seat.  its a buy and watch once a month kinda movie.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|If they this game or the best free roam on a kindle I've ever seen only a extremely long download but if u like spider get it graphic as if it playing a ps3 or Xbox get the game it's worth the price
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read. I finished it in 2 days an amazing ending to an amazing story I wish it could have gone on longer
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is super fun there is constant missions and cool movies I can do on this game u : have to buy it it it is good gadgets you can use my friend and I played the game I really like it it is not bad buy it
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Great thrill ride. I just hated the ending.  Very corny! The movie delivers when it comes to scares but went from a crazy scary movie to this fantastical butterfly ending.  REALLY!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Fun game. Easy to play. Great game for entire family. Recommend this for everyone whether you are young or old.  Enjoy
B0015XHP3G|4.0|The second movie opens with everyone's favorite tortured war hero in prison due to the rampage he went on last time. At the onset he is visited by Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who offers him a job in exchange for a possible pardon. Upon learning he will be sent into Vietnam to search for POWs still being held prisoner by the Viet Cong, Rambo readily agrees to the mission. From there he is flown to a base near the Vietnamese border and meets with Murdoch (the ever-surly Charles Napier), the man in charge of the operation. After a harrowing plane ride, he drops into enemy territory to make contact with Co (Julia Nickson), and as you probably know, the rest is history. Rambo proceeds to butcher every enemy in sight in his relentless war on oppression and becomes an iconic action hero.<br /><br />If First Blood created Rambo, than Part II unleashed him. This movie, along with Rambo III, is what people usually think of when they think of Rambo. From here on out he is an unstoppable killing machine--shooting, stabbing and exploding America's enemies. Beneath it all, the tortured soul from First Blood is alive and well, though less apparent since he once again has a purpose. I like the part where he explains to Co what it means to be expendable, and later she declares to him, \\"You are not expendable.\\" This is the only Rambo movie to feature a love interest.<br /><br />This movie ties with Rambo III for my second favorite of the series behind First Blood. I prefer the first one since it has such a strong focus on character development. Still, these movies are all enjoyable since in each one you get to see a different side of John Rambo. And, of course, each one delivers on his immortal promise: \\"I'll give you a war you won't believe.\\"
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is one of the best  and funnest waist of time. I give this a 4 star rating. Awesome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game worked well lots of cool settings and things to do its like you really own your own horse stables you can compete in competitions and everything
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Cut the Rope: Time Travel is great! Now you get to feed two &quot;Om Nom's&quot;, which is a lot of fun. The levels are challenging so that you don't blow through the whole game in one day, but not too hard to the point where you want to quit, so it's great. Definitely get this game, it's a great time killer and a lot of fun.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|The title says it all. The movies are great. I got this because I really wanted the first three movies on blu-ray.  And it was a great deal. The quality of the picture is pretty good.  The only complaint I have about this set is the box itself.  It has this terrible sleeve system that is a pain to get the movies out, and you have to grab the flat side of the disc to get them out, which is stupid design to say the least.  I give the movies a 5/5 and the case a 1/5.  I haven't watched the bonus features yet so I can't talk about those.  I would say only consider buying this if you can get it for a good deal. I'm considering pulling all the movies out and putting them in a different case.
B005HSL626|5.0|Who doesn't love this simple but fun game, Play a lot when I don't want to think to hard on other games. Plus was my first free game loaded to my new Kindle Fire HD that Santa brought
B0054N73EY|5.0|didn't love it at first but after listening to it more it grooves. josh brings a new element to the band which nobody was rerady for but is welcome. just saw the chillis live it was the best ever if you even kind of like them go and see them it bleeeew my mind!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  A lot of drama and with some insight into the struggles with mental illness in our society.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Every one should at least listen to it. Im sure you will love it too
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|This movie is just bad. Paint by the numbers. You've seen dozens other movies just like that one. Don't spend your money. Tom Cruise is playing Tom Cruise and it just doesn't work in this movie.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Since i first heard them on Saturday Night Live, these guys have been moving my spirit - the album is FANTASTIC, and i look forward to more!
B00CM96A60|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CM96A60 Intense]]<br /><br />Intense is Armin's Best. Every track has something special - loving the entire album. The first one is based off of classical violin -- and then Trevor's \\"what is feels like\\" is phenomenal.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Too FUEGO! I love this hot album. Just amazing. I will always be a fan. Good job. FUEGO. Love it
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I bought this game, knowing the Rusk if it sucking and the storyline would be terrible. Well, I started playing it, and here us what I am going to say... THUS GAME  IS SO ADDICTING AND AWESOME!!!!!!! I love roaming the city!!!!! Great action in it. Definitely 5 out of 5!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This is basically Temple Run With Iron Man. The game looks great and is fun to play. It can be a bit laggy on the Kindle Fire HD but for the most part plays well. As with most Gameloft games there is an opportunity for micro-payments but they can be avoided if you are willing to put the time in to it. My only other complaint is the size of the game, it's a huge download so only get this game if you are willing to dedicate the space on your device.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I saw this although not through amazon rentals, but this movie was very good-- nearly excellent, if Tom Cruise stays along the lines of this character or the one he plays in the mission impossilble sequels then he is very good....These type of movies could go along ways in bolstering his sometimes dwindling desireability at the box office.<br />I want to mention my favorite parts of this movie, first of all the car chase scene was top notch and somewhat realistic, then there was the fight scene in the rain at the mining site-- it had a very eerie realistic quality and I was drawn into the scene<br />as if I was there witnessing it, very wonderful cinematographic effect....
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Heart wrenching, but with a happy ending. It doesn't get much better than that! One of my favorite books ever.
B007A2O3FO|2.0|Having enjoyed the 1995 Jack Finney book, &#34;From Time To Time&#34; I figured that the movie might be a nice interesting time travel story. I was wrong. It could've been made that way... instead the director had the main character revert back to the past not by traveling through time, but through ghosts there in the house. I learned a long time ago that there was one eventuality as regards humans.... Ecclesiastes 3:19 puts it: &#34;as the one dies, so dies the other (animals and man); they all have but one spirit... all go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.&#34; Needless to say, I was disappointed. Time travel would've worked. To my estimation, this didn't.
1400069807|5.0|Such a great well researched book. Extremely informative and held my attention the entire time. Everyone should read this book
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I have so much fun with it.  it works great with my kindle.  only advice don't start playing if you don't want to become addicted to it.  :)
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|Wow I never thought I would buy a Bon Jovi cd and fall asleep. Boring Boring Boring and oh yeah boring.
B007QSNMS6|4.0|This book attempts to set out 7 laws of velocity that the authors feel describe the new ways we should work today. Grounded very much in the commercial world, there is much to reflect on in what they say. Some, if not much, may strike the reader as common sense, but it is often expressed in an easy going conversational style which perhaps facilitates its reception. Each chapter is presented as a conversation between the authors - this was refreshing in the beginning but for me, the novelty wore off towards the end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Started reading this series on a recommendation from a friend. After around book 3, I couldn't put it down. Really makes you think about where we're headed. The pages flow very smoothly, making it an easy read. Looking forward to the next 3 installments.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've long been a Sheryl Sandberg fan and this book only furthered my respect for her. Five stars because:<br />1. The message is important and something everyone should consider. Sheryl doesn't preach, she shares her experience, observations of others, and simply states facts based on studies and research. The result is really incontestable.<br />2. The book is an extremely fast and enjoyable read and there's a take-away for everyone.
B0013FBS20|1.0|I think this movie should have been called Omega Man since they seem to base more on that Heston version of the story than the actual book. Oh and btw they are VAMPIRES  how hard is that to say?!?! This book is incredible and really takes the vampire myth and deconstructs it, the movie however is a turd. He is Legend which in the book means THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, but of course in this terrible film much like in Omega Man there are other survivors or \\"legends\\"  just Read the book or watch the Vincent Price flick which actually sticks to the story
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play this game.  It is very addictive.  I play it at least once a day.  I also have 3 other versions of bingo, but enjoy this one the most.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|This movie wasn't nearly as funny as it was hyped to be. The humor was mild but mostly just bland sex jokes over and over. No real wit or clever jokes to be found, nothing even that original.<br /><br />The characters were all pretty unlikable and annoying but the plot was decent and the action sequences were fun. The cast are all talented sure but that doesn't make it a good movie. The poor dialogue mixed with failing shock humor puts these normally skilled actors at their lowest.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was mildly entertaining but not one I'd rush out to buy or tell others about. It had a couple of light chuckle moments and a few scenes that were pretty cool but mostly it was just forgettable. Definitely get this one from the library or somewhere you can see it for free first.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book. I think its a smooth read. Watch out Fifty Shades Bared to You is just as good if not better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a must read. It made me not want to put it down. It was absolutely amazing. Wanting more!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Boring at some parts.  Good storyline, some of the time.  The characters were described very well and interesting as well.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was just as shocking as the first book! I still can't believe that Simon is a vampire and that Clary knows how to wake her mother. This book was written perfectly and it had even more twists and turns in it than the first one! I loved all the surprises and eye openers! I can't wait for THIS movie to come out! Excellent job Cassandra Clare!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome<br />There is some obstacles but u get the hang of it.<br /><br />If u don't like it it's a good thing that's it's free<br /><br />Again AWESOME GAME<br />I play it 24.7
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It was one of the better games I've played. I like being able to search different areas on my own. I also liked that that you could touch an item in the inventory and it would tell you what it was. I forget sometimes what I have in my inventory so that is especially helpful to me throughout the game. I also enjoyed that the Actors spoke, I don't mind reading when they don't it is just a bonus that I think adds character t o they game. The puzzles weren't extremely difficult but I did seek help a few times. And the length of the game was perfect. I don't have time to finish a game in one setting, I am a mom so I only get a few minutes here and there, so it took me almost a week they o finish and I love having a game to look forward to playing when I get some extra time. Five stars from me, it had everything I enjoy in a hidden object adventure game!
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|aLREADY HAVE VERSION WITH Toby  Stephens and Ruth Wilson, which is my favorite.  Have seen Orson Wells version and wanted to see this new one.  Enjoyed it but , the one I named first is my favorite.  Saw mia and have alice in wonderland movie.  Think she is one to look out for.  Thoroughly enjoyed her in both movies.  Thanks, Virginia McGlasson
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|Why would this series ever get bad reviews? It's magnificent! I am never going to forget it. It will stay in my mind forever!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|one of the most inspirational books i have ever read....everyone should read this book!  One of the people I hope to meet in Heaven!
0385536828|2.0|In the first pages of this book, main character Serena Frome, summed up her reading preferences beautifully (I've edited to the present tense): \\"My needs are simple. I don't bother much with theme or felicitous phrases and skip fine descriptions of weather, landscapes and interiors. I want characters I can believe in, and I want to be made curious about what is to happen to them.\\" I thought, wow, that's exactly the kind of book I like - I can't wait to see what comes next! Unfortunately, McEwan then went on to bore me to tears with Serena's milquetoast personality and the dullest covert operation ever planned. Such a promising set up. Such a great disappointment.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|IT WAS JUST DONE FABULOUSLY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. THE BLUE-RAY CONCEPT MAKES IT LOOK JUST FABULOUS.<br />THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IT COULD TAKE ME AT LEAST 6-12 MONTHS TO VIEW IT ALL AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, WILL THIS TIME FRAME WILL THEY DO THE RIGHT THING BY ME?<br /><br />IT JUST LOOKS SO MUCH MORE BETTER WITH THE BLUE RAY BOTTOM LINE!
B008DK3QBY|4.0|It seems when I first became interested in classical music in the early 80s, Barenboim's Beethoven sonatas and Mozart piano concerti were the ones everyone owned.  So with a bit of nostalgia at play in my heart I bought this set, having now listened to Beethoven's sonatas for many years and having listened a lot to the sets of Brendel, Kovacevich, Kempff, Goode, Ashkenazy, Arrau and,just of late, Frank.  Single issue discs that I also like are Pollini, Gilels, Perahia, Alfredo Perl and Angela Hewitt.  I'm unsure whether to give this a 3 or a 4. I think quite highly of this set because, like all great interpreters of Beethoven, Barenboim has a unique and enlightening perspective on the sonatas and he maintains this vision throughout the cycle.  This set stands as an incredible achievement for a pianist who was in his mid-late 20s when he recorded it.  Barenboim's take on Beethoven is highly romantic, comming out at a time when the more lean and refined style of say Kempff and Brendel was beginning to cast the dominant shadow over the interpretive landscape; correspondingly there's a passion, a lushness and a lyricism about Barenboim's playing that shape both the high points and low points of the set.<br /><br />First the high points.  I think his take on the well known minor-key, name sonatas is incredible.  By that I mean the Pathetique, the Moonlight, the Apassionata and the Tempest.  The drama and sheer beauty Barenboim conjures forth in these 4 blockbuster sonatas is alone worth the price of admission.  Given the many skittish takes on the Appassionata of late that confuse speed with passion and purpose (I'm thinking of the 90s Brendel, Hewitt and Goode), its refreshing to hear an unabashedly epic Appassionata that starts with all the mystery and grandeur the opening requires and then flies off at the end into madness.  In all four, Barenbboim mixes power with intensity and lyricism, and after hearing so many Moonlights it's miraculous how Barenboim makes it come alive as an extended fantasy that passes through sorrow, yearning and rage.  Also, his playing of the Tempest's adagio is one of those moments of indescribable magic that I won't say anything more about, because it's indescribable.  Perhaps because Barenboim scores so definitively with his interpretations of the most popular of Beethoven's sonatas, his name is always in the mix of premier interpreters of Beethoven.  Other high points include the other opus 31's, the Les Adieux, op. 90 and op. 101.<br /><br />Now for the drawbacks.  If one's interpretive framework is unabashedly romantic, as the young Barenboim's is here, then the stunningly successful risks you take on the one hand can sometimes translate into affectation and self-indulgence on the other.  The tempi are often slow and there are times when it just doesn't come off.  For instance, there's a reason no other major pianist--or none I've heard anyway--plays the finale of the Waldstein at the tempo Barenboim chooses: it doesn't work, is alien to the structure and spirit of the piece, and sounds plain awful.  To make such an interpretive faux pas on such a major work is a huge shortcoming of this set.  Other instances where Barenboim, in search of profundity, ends up wallowing and dying like a beached whale are the slow movements of the op. 2/3, the op.10/3, the op.22, and his not-dead-yet-but-it's-bound-to-happen-soon op. 26.  Many listeners fault Claudio Arrau for his slow tempi, but while Arrau's choices seems hard won from decades of playing and meditating on Beethoven, Barenboim at times sounds shallow and precocious.<br /><br />One would think that Barenboim's relative youth and tendency to ambitiously overreach would be ruthlessly exposed by the Hammerklavier and the final three sonatas.  Surprisingly though, he comports himself with dignity--if not distinction--here.  However, depending on your perspective on the op. 111 concluding variations, you might find yourself silently willing Barenboim to get on with it.<br /><br />So overall, when Barenboim is good, he's brilliant and definitive.  However, when he's off, you might be so irritated that your opinion of him will veer wildly into frustration and annoyance.  Like Brendel, Kempff, Kovacevich and even Arrau, there are moments when you won't buy into what Barenboim's doing, and you'll want to look and listen elsewhere.  Still, there's no question that this set captures a brilliant, ambitious young pianist who was prepared to take great risks with Beethoven, and you have to admire him for it.  At the price, I think you should buy it if you're into having more than one set of Beethoven.  If you want one set that is consistent and without eccentricity, but correspondingly might be missing those flashes of original genius, I think Ashkenazy or Perl might be the way to go. I'll end here with a list of my favorite interpreters at this time of Beethoven's sonatas, for what its worth:<br /><br />Opus 2s Goode Brendel Arrau(for extended epic treatments of these 3 sonatas)<br />Opus 7 Hewitt Goode Brendel<br />Opus 10s Goode Ashkenazy Brendel (Arrau's is a great 10/3)<br />Opus 13 Barenboim Kovacevich Arrau<br />Opus 14s Kovacevich Richter Goode<br />Opus 22 Richter Kovacevich<br />Opus 26 Brendel Kempff<br />Opus 27s Barenboim Arrau Brendel (Moonlight). Arrau Kempff Brendel (opus 27/1)<br />Opus 28 Arrau Kempff Perl<br />Opus 31s Kovacevich Barenboim Ashkenazy (Goode & Brendel are both great for 31/3)<br />Opus 49s Richter Brendel Goode<br />Opus 53 Ashkenazy Brendel Kempff Perl Arrau<br />Opus 54 Arrau Brendel Richter<br />Opus 57 Arrau Richter Barenboim Kovacevich Ashkenazy<br />Opus 78 Kempff Arrau Goode<br />Opus 79 Goode Gilels Kempff<br />Opus 81a Kovacevich Gilels Ashkenazy<br />Opus 90 Gilels Annie Fischer Kempff<br />Opus 101 Pollini Brendel Annie Fischer<br />Opus 106 Pollini Eschenbach Arrau Ashkenazy<br />Opus 109 Pollini Perl Ashkenazy<br />Opus 110 Kovacevich Arrau Perl<br />Opus 111 Pollini Arrau Perlet on with it.<br /><br />So overall, when Barenboim is good, he's brilliant and definitive.  However, when he's off, you might be so irritated that your opinion of him will veer wildly into frustration and annoyance.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|FRIGGIN AWESOME GAME AND IS VERY NOOB FRIENDLY. I don't even usually play FPS games, and I would recommend this to anyone.
B000V6AEM2|5.0|I had been listening to this CD for free on spotify for months and I finally decided to buy it.  I'm not a harp expert, so I can't give a very informed opinion but wow!
1609611543|5.0|This is a very fasinating book.  I am reading it now and have scanned the pages to be sure of the condition.  This is a really great book and everyone should have a copy.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Well developed characters. While there were some pretty graphic sex sections, they didn't detract from the plot. The book held my interest from beginning to end.
B000FC146C|5.0|I cannot believe this novel was written over 30 years ago. It is so easy to become part of the magic of \\"The Thornbirds\\"
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. Wish it was easier to get energy. Please fix this if you can when any new updates come out. Thank you G5.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Most of the books in the Sookie Stackhouse-series has evolved around Sookie and Eric's complicated relationship. It deserved a prober closure. This book didn't provide that at all, and because of that, this is one of the most disappointing endings of a book series that I have ever read. It doesn't feel complete at all.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love this app. it is one of my favorite apps I ever got on my kindle. it addicting at first but then it isn't but is still fun.
B00C1S945G|5.0|its Star Trek, enough said. If you were on this page to begin with you are probably going to watch it, or have already watched it and know that it is the greatest.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish there were more games like this out there. I completely enjoyed it and look forward to more. I get so tired of hidden object games. This was great.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Personally, I thought the series would end exactly how it did - what shocks me is the mean, almost personal attacks on the author.  Reminds me of how readers started attacking Laurel when the Anita Blake series didn't make them happy.  In my opinion the authors own the characters and can do with them what they want.  No one forced us to purchase these books, if you were doubtful if you wanted it we have a wonderful public library system.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|It only seems like forever since the last Dead Can Dance release, but Anastasis feels like a natural extension of their past work. Brendan Perry still has the voice of a haunting dark angel, perfectly complimented by Lisa Gerrard's chill-to-the-bone alto and accompanied by a soundtrack that hints at goth, new age, ambient, and Middle Eastern while still being clearly a sound that is of its own.<br /><br />If you know and love Dead Can Dance, this album will be comfort food to your ears. If you do not know them, this album is reflective of their sound in all its grandeur.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Great movie!  Everyone who loves Nicholas Sparks needs to see this movie!  Watched it twice the first day it came.
0762777931|5.0|I highly recommend this book! Can't wait to start the 21 day detox! If your interested in changing your whole life read this book!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Love this DVD but what else could you expect from Lady A!  They are still the greatest! Recommend it highly!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I loved this when it first came out and now my 5 year old Grand daughter and I are enjoying it again!
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Ray lends his soulful voice to these Country classics, giving them a distinctive interpretation that only Ray Charles could do. If you like the late Ray Charles you should love this album.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Another game that wants you to pay to advance, and to complete quests.  It's fun in the beginning, but wears on you as you attempt to advance.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Finally I found a book worth reading! I loved how the author intertwined both past and present to tell this story- kept my interest and peaked my curiosity until the very end.

Would you give it two, three, four or five Stars.<br /><br />A :  Four and half stars.<br /><br />Q:  What did you like most about the movie.<br /><br />A:  Jack<br /><br />Q:  Did you enjoy the story as well.<br /><br />A:  Yes<br /><br />Q:  Would you watch it again? If so how many times?<br /><br />A:  Yes many times.<br /><br />So there you have it. She liked the movie but Loves Jack, he's hot according to her and she likes to watch him the most but she thinks the story is cool.
B000001FT2|5.0|This is a very good addition to my collection  I had to get this recording because I remembered &#34;Walking in the Rain&#34; from many years ago.  I am so happy to have it now in my collection.  The other songs have a very nice Jamaican sound.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is much much better than dh3. it actually has a story!!! just like before, you've got all four classes but they've balanced em out a little better. sadly though, my precious archer isn't as tough and you cant keep buying health potions but that's all the bad. good news: they've got awesome dialogue and badguys wont follow u around ( basically if u leave their fight area, they'll leave u alone) and bosses are freaking intense. best of all, ITS FREEEEEEE
B003H3IOLE|5.0|More character sketches than plot-driven, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn transports readers to a wonderfully detailed Brooklyn at the turn of the century. I have read this book at least 8 times and each is better than the last. Smith does a fabulous job of making you feel as though you really do know Francie as you watch her grow up.
B00AEFYSEA|2.0|Slow moving, long tedious scenes with actors staring into each others eyes hands ready to reach for their guns.<br />leading lady come's out with the clanger suggesting the cowboy throw her over the table and get pleasure from her and tell his mates to come and join in too saying &#34;No woman ever died from dong that&#34;.BORING,with senseless violence.
B000000ORX|5.0|Combines all the facets that make Joni a true master. Seeming simplicity combined with dense musicality and interesting and meaningful lyrics. Larry Kline's bass playing is unique and propels the music around Joni's very interesting percussion and dense, but somehow simple-sounding chords. Can't quite explain that, but that's Joni Mitchell for you.<br />Personally, this is my favorite Joni Mitchell album. For those who like Turbulent Indigo, or her early folk type works, and the jazz work, there's something for everyone here. From Night ride home, to Two Grey Rooms, it is a wonderful thing to listen to.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I was snagged into watching by the same urge that make you pop into a strip club....just to see what's going on in there.  Wow, was I ever surprised to find this feel good movie that moved me to tears twice.  It won an Oscar for a reason; the cast is excellent, and you find yourself rooting for all the character's and truly empathizing with them.  It was awesome to watch by myself, but might be weird in a group setting.  Do yourself a favor and allow yourself to be open to the message, and you might walk away with a new perspective on the human spirit.
0307744434|5.0|This book was a suggestion from our book club. I don't know that I would have picked it up ordinarily but I found it very enchanting. I started the book as an Audible download, purchased an e-version so that I could read it when I wasn't in the car. Then bought a copy to share...that I cannot keep on the shelf.<br /><br />I know not everyone thought it was as enchanting as I did, but they found it to be an interesting read nonetheless. I would suggest reading it in the winter when the Holiday season offers an air of magic as well.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Good story but a lame slogan motivating Reacher's team.  Not crazy about the ending, but there's sure plenty of action.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie is excellent! Classic Tarantino, with all star cast. A must own for any Tarantino collector and for any cinimatography buff!
0205313426|3.0|I was disappointed with this book. The book gives some good advice about what to do and what not to do in writing, and I appreciate that. But I find the book too short and does not contain enough materials. It does not illustrate enough elements of style.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I thought I had this story figured out but this book has so many twist it keep you on the edge of your seat.  I can't wait to see what will come of the recent events.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Entertaining and fun. The game was worth the money. Miles the monkey was a cute helper. I only wish it was a little bit longer.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It presented  what I think is a very<br />interesting and insightful story of how the Nazi and Communist programs were able to happen.  So many of the people, trying to make positive change, really didn't understand what they were doing -- some really regretted the changes and others just became horribly trapped by them and they affected the whole world for many decades.

B009G78EE2|5.0|Such a great album!!! I bought it for his other songs besides Thrift Shop.  Its one of the best hip hop albums I have heard in yrs. It has pop songs like thrift shop & introspective tracks like Same Love. The production is top shelf & with no filler skits or interludes. I only wish I had bought the extended album for those extra songs.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Fun series with some unexpected twists and surprises. A series that both my wife and I like and watch together.

B003L77GGK|5.0|Back in the day, when it was the &#34;WB&#34;, I seen the promo's for this show. Little did I know that when I watched the &#34;Premiere&#34; it would pull me in, mezmerize me and make me a, what my friends call me, fanatic.  If you are into the &#34;Supernatural&#34;, with Vampires, Werewolves and all other creatures of the night, if you are not watching this show, I can only say...Why?...Jensen and Jared may not be brothers in real life, but their chemestry, their ability to &#34;know&#34; what each other is thinking is incredible. They are the only ones who could ever, ever be Sam and Dean Winchester. The underlying story of &#34;Hell&#34; vs. &#34;Heaven&#34; and their unrelenting quest to take care of the &#34;Family Business&#34; drives this show to a &#34;edge of your seat&#34;, white knuckle thrill ride. It pains me to say that the show did lose it's momentum, the last several years, but this season, it's back to it's classic first years. Giving its loyal fans what we look for in the show.<br /><br />The only other show that did this for me was the &#34;X-files.&#34; I have the Collectors edition box set.<br /><br />&#34;Supernatural.&#34; I have every Season.<br />Then I got a Blue ray player and Hi-def Television.<br /><br />In one trip, I bought every season on Blu-ray. (I Buy both regular and Blue ray sets.) Fanatic. Yes..and proud of it.<br /><br />If you've never seen it....watch the 1st episode. You will be hooked.<br /><br />To Jared and Jensen...Thank you!<br />To the CW, treat this show like Gold. Because that's what you have!

B000EWBKM6|5.0|There will never be another show to match the &#34;One-liners&#34;, the prat falls...the chemestry, and being gutsy enough to say that &#34;There is nothing wrong with being Gay.&#34;  Yes, there was knee slapping humour, guest stars galore, acting genious...and the chemestry of four amazing actors. But the show also was not afraid to address the senseless ridicule that we, as Gay's have to face everyday of our life. The only other show that came close was &#34;Queer as Folk.&#34; I miss both shows, dearly.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have read all the books, and seen all the movies, and this one fits right in.<br />the only surprise - guess I didnt read up on it - didnt know there will be a part 2  hahahaha<br />even have the animated versions.  all well done. at least as well as you can translate books to movies - there will be times that some information just would make the movie too long to fit it all in.. take it with a grain of salt and enjoy the entertainment !

B000005RQT|5.0|4th studio album by Deep Purple, \\"In Rock\\", (1970), classic!  This is the first album by the Mark II line-up, Gillan, Paice, Blackmore, Glover and Lord.  The album begins with the have mercy on our souls electric guitar power of Ritchie Blackmore followed by Jon Lord and his churchy organ riff \\"Speed King\\", just a great track, followed by other souped up rockers in, \\"Living Wreck\\",  \\"Bloodsucker\\", Blackmore brings it on \\"Flight Of The Rat\\", Gillan gives it his all in \\"Into The Fire\\" and the band gives us the 10 plus minute classic anthem \\"Child In Time\\", which It's a Beautiful Day copied the riff on their song \\" Bombay Calling \\",  Lord and the female vocalist Patti Santos were dating at the time.  On the bonus tracks we get, \\"Black Night\\",  a single that charted in England, along with \\"Cry Free\\" and 5 studio chats, fun to here this interplay.  Deep Purple was now a hard rocking outfit.  \\"Fireball\\", would come next.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|\\"CLoud Nine\\", (1987), is my favorite George Harrison album. (Could George look any happier on the cover).  Produced by Jeff Lynne of ELO fame, this album doesn't fool around, great from start to finish.  Lynne is my favorite musician of all-time and when he teamed upped with ex-Beatle George Harrison, i knew this would be special.<br />On the opening track we get the title track, just a classic with some nice sax work by Jim Horn.  \\"That's What It Takes\\", written by Harrison, Lynne and Wright.  Another dynamic track, very ELO , Gary Wright on keyboards.  Harrison's humor comes through on the bouncy track \\"Fish On The Sand\\".  The ballad \\"Just For Today\\", nice piano on this tune.  Harrison Lynne tune, the playful \\"This Is Love\\", the 3rd single from the album.  Harrison and Lynne also wrote the classic Beatle days \\"When Was Fab\\", the 2nd single, nice cello work by Bobby Kok.  Eric Clapton helps out on the rockin' \\"Devil's Radio\\".  The Harrison wordplay and good pop-rocker \\"Wreck Of The Hesperus\\".  The Asian sound of \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\".  And the 1st single from the album, also #1 the Rudy Clark, George Harrison tune \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\", Jim Horn again on sax.  George brought it home here!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I found this movie to be super cute and fun, definitely one of my favorites since Brother Bear. I found the characters to be entertaining and there was a depth of personality that you don't see often in cartoons these days. Also there was great family dynamics and a loving family behind the story that made me enjoy the movie right from the git go. My son who is almost a year loves this movie and wants to watch it nearly daily.
B00003INJ6|5.0|1968 gave us Deep Purple's first album, \\"Shades Of Deep Purple\\".  Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Nick Simper and Rod Evans the first line-up.  The album begins with the instrumental \\"And The Address\\", which gives us Blackmore's smokin'  guitar and Lord's great keyboard work.  Everyone should know by now the classic #4 hit \\"Hush\\" written by Joe South.  The swirling keyboards of Lord on, \\"One More Rainy Day\\", very late 60's pop-rock, Rod Evans vocals resemble the pop vocalist of the era.  \\"Prelude-I'm So Glade\\", Lord's organ flourishes on \\"Prelude\\", with some good bass feels from Simper.  \\"I'm So Glade\\", written by Skip James, done the year before by Cream, on this version Ritchie smokes it out of the park.  \\"Mandrake Root\\", has that feel of Hendrix's \\"Foxy Lady\\", nice organ break by Lord in the middle of this song.  The cover of The Beatles \\"Help\\", is way different, very emotional depth here, Evans and the band do good.  \\"Love Help Me\\", with Blackmore's strong guitar and the rhythm section of Simper and Paice, help out this pop-psychedlic number.  Their version of \\"Hey Joe\\", is just beyond belief, you get Lord's organ and Ritchie's guitar like there in Mexican desert somewhere.  the instrumentation on this 7 1/2 minute track is great,  this song was covered a bunch by many bands in the late 60's, \\"Hendrix, The Byrds,  Love and The Leaves to name a few.  The bonus tracks gave us \\"Shadows\\", a nice add on to this album.  \\"Book Of Taliesyn\\", would be next.
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|Ubik is, well, a Philip K. Dick novel. By that, I mean it has just what one would expect from PKD. Characters, and readers, lost as to what is real and what is not?  Check. Sense of world and time out of joint?  Check. Characters who feel something is after them, some malevolent force?  Check. Drugs. Psi-powers. Attacks on consumerism. And ending that leaves you even more confused. Check. Check. Check. And oh yes, check.<br /><br />Summarizing a Dick novel can be an exercise in futility. Without experiencing it in its entirety, it can sound wholly absurd (not that Dick shies away from the absurd, mind you). But here goes anyway. Glen Runciter runs the best anti-psi business going in 1992, with an especially worried focus on his arch-nemesis Hollis, who seems to run the best psi (telepath, pre-cog) organization going. At the start of the novel, many of Hollis' top telepaths have disappeared, leaving Runciter extremely anxious as to what Hollis is planning. After a quick visit to talk with his dead wife . . .. [Um, see what I mean about summaries? OK, the dead aren't wholly dead, they can be put on \\"coldpac\\" in moratoriums as \\"half-lifers\\" who can still communicate with people, though each communication accelerates their inevitable movement toward full death. It also turns out that communication can get muddy, as happens when his wife was stored too close to this annoying half-lifer kid named Jory who kind of horned in on her frequency and co-opted her conversation with Runciter. Still with me?  Moving on . . . ] After talking to his dead wife, Runciter is handed what appears to be a great job on the moon, which is where he believes Hollis' psis have gone. Collecting a dozen or so of his best anti-psis, including Joe Chip, his chosen heir, and a strange new anti-psi named Pat, he heads off to the moon. Things, however, take a turn for the worse and when the group returns to Earth, they find that time seems to be \\"regressing,\\"--sleek futuristic cars begin turning intosubsequently older versions of themselves until by the end they're puttering around in late Model-T type cars. Worse, an accelerated regression effect begins to strike them personally, and as they begin dying off one at a time, they start a frantic search for Ubik, a mysterious substance that allegedly holds the key to stopping the time regression.<br /><br />Now, people have differing views on Dick's style. Personally, I tend to enjoy him more for his ideas than his writing craft, and the same holds in Ubik. Exposition can be clunky, dialogue more so. The first 50 pages or so are hard to get into thanks to said clunkiness, but also due to a lot of unfamiliar terms being tossed the readers way and many abrupt shifts between scenes. The terms start to become more familiar or better integrated, though the scene shifts never really get handled smoothly, nor does the exposition/dialogue improve much. There are certainly some plot holes, or at least, some possible plot holes (when reality itself is questioned it's hard to be sure). And there is also the potential problem, always the case with older science fiction/fantasy, that experienced readers may come away thinking \\"I've seen this sort of thing before; it's not so original.\\" At which point I can only say, \\"yes, you probably have. But that's because Dick did it first and so yes, it actually was original. Oh, and get off my lawn you kids.\\"<br /><br />So Ubik is not the most fluid or sophisticated of literary works from a craftsman point of view. But I enjoyed it all the way through nonetheless for its ideas and the world (s) being presented. As is almost always the case with Dick, the characters struggle with identity, with just who they are in this world, as well as struggling with just what world this is. Or even if this is a world. Reality is continually being questioned and I like that both as a game between reader and author and also as a more metaphysical question to explore.  Sometimes you just want to take poor Joe Chip and shake him up, but you also feel for him as he is assaulted by all these questions. What is reality? Who am I? Does the \\"me\\" I am change if the world around me does? What forces make me who I am? Are they malevolent?  Benign?  Wholly, coldly indifferent to my existence?  Am I, in the end, truly and solely alone?  Or can my existential isolation be broken through?  And so on.<br /><br />The fact that such questions are wedded to an interesting narrative, a murder mystery, some neat physical effects such as artifacts regressing, and that they are also surrounded by some classic Dick humor surrounding where modern society is going (one running gag is how everything in this society is coin-operated--including the door of one's apartment, which won't let you out of your own home unless you scarf up that money). In addition to the big questions, Dick wonders about all this modern \\"improvement,\\" having Joe Chip react positively to some of the regression changes in objects--the nicer feel of a cowhide wallet versus the plastic one it had been, the purr of an old gasoline engine.<br /><br />Ubik can be a rough read in terms of writing style, but it's mostly a quick one: fast-paced, relatively focused, driven by urgency. Though not my favorite by him, it does get at many of the foundational questions in his work and so I think it's an important one by him. But a better reason to read it beyond its \\"importance\\" in a major author's output is that it is both enjoyable and makes the reader think. Sure, the writing is rough, but two out of three ain't bad.
B00B8WXEXO|4.0|Good solid rock album following the same formula as the last outing. Highly enjoyable for fans of retro style rock.

B005FVNIW6|5.0|Magnificent! It has the feel of a first novel, it is a little dated in its technology, but has a depth of meaning and moral fabric that is timeless. A masterpiece, written in a simple, uncomplicated fashion. It leaves us with dilemmas which do not have have easy or any real answers. I'm glad that I took the time to read it.

Tame Impala outdone themselves once again. If you loved their first record, you're gonna die for this once. Every track is perfectly lined up to be an amazing journey into Kevin Parker's (singer) head. Go get it now!

0375851569|5.0|I bought this book set for my friends boy. He loves Dr. Seuss and loved this set. He reads the books everyday. I definitely recommend this.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|The key to this book is to notice the change in dates and years at the beginning of each chapter, (I didn't notice this for the first 3 chapters and couldn't quite understand why the main character kept changing personalities).  Once I got that, I just couldn't put this book down.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have to say that this app was really worked on for a while. It has a lot of features and interesting modes. It is incredibly realistic and u need to know a bit about geography to succeed. As I already said, miniclip has really worked hard on this app. I love how so much is included. I completely recommend this app. If you ask me,this app should be worth more. It is a great experience an  I definitely recommend it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I stopped short of giving the book 5 stars because of my heading. All in all a well done mystery/crime novel but Larson wrote on about somethings that just needed cursory mentions! I will read the next book and I look forward to it!

B009ZE27US|4.0|I actually fell for it....... feel kinda stupid actually.  I thought this would read my thumb print - as I was sitting there with my thumb pressed up against the screen it finally hit me, this is just a screen with no scanning functionality.  LOL

B00338QENI|5.0|I was never a \\"science person\\" in school, instead gravitating towards the humanities. This book made the scientific language and history accessible, and Skloot gracefully vascillated between history, analysis and personal reflection. I highly recommend this book!
B00AG51V8E|4.0|Run of the mill spy movie. Has some good twists. Bruce Willis isn't in this very long witch i think is too bad.
B00BI6SVCE|5.0|Like all of Sam Beam's (Iron &Wine) efforts, Ghost on Ghost is a beautiful collection of amazing lyrics set to equally amazing musical arrangements.  While some will say Ghost on Ghost doesn't sound anything like Beam's earlier records....they're simply not paying attention to the journey Sam has taken musically.  I'm happy to be along for the ride, wherever it goes.
B00BB67UNW|4.0|This is pretty good. It does have its slow points but they aren't awlful. Mark Walhberg is good in this.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|Great concept for the series overall, but this book gets lost on the siege of Luthadel. Plus, all the characters are constantly pessimistic about everything.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game has potential and was entertaining, but I hope further games will be offered as an update and not another game to purchase. Might be worth it for a less experienced player, who would find it more challenging.
B00CQWA4LU|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is the key to this show's entertainment. Every scene she is in keeps you engaged with high tension, crazy plot lines and a super hot supporting cast.lt amazes how many characters she plays and how effortless it appears. Look forward to each and every episode. So glad it was renewed for a second season.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this. I'm going to school online and this very helpful especially since it is<br /> right there on my Kindle with my books.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I rented this movie the other day from my local library because I didn't get to finish watching the entire movie when it was shown on the Syfy channel. I am glad I did. I bought a copy of this movie through Amazon. You will not be disappointed with this movie. You will be glad that you watched it. It is an enjoyable and special movie because all the characters in the movie learn to work with one another and they become quick friends afterwards. Everyone works toward a common goal and there is a strong sense and feeling of community. You do not see this bigotry of class or races because everyone is the same underneath regardless of where you are from.<br />I recommend this movie wholeheartedly and you will want to see it many more times; especially when you want to watch something with substance and true meaning.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|A must for any Kurt Vile fan, he has really hit his stride on wakin on a pretty daze.  This is music.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you've read all the Sookie novels from the start of the series as I have, and couldn't put down the first eight or so...don't bother reading this piece of garbage.  Read the spoilers instead and save yourself the trouble.  This book reads like it was written by Alan Ball, and  isn't worth the $12.95.  As early as chapter three it became painfully obvious what boring character she would end up (out of the blue) settling for.  Predictable and dull, inconsistencies in character development and the \\"Sookieverse\\" abound. Perhaps the author thinks this garbage will entice us to read the final book (so she can squeeze a little more money out of this series) to see what happens to Sookie.  I'm confident that Sookie will be living in a trailer with her \\"best friend\\" and collie, giving birth to puppies while she spends the rest of her life waiting tables.  Harris might think that's a fitting ending to the Southern VAMPIRE Mysteries, but I do not. Having to give this book even one star is painful.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you're a fan of True Blood, where the characters are flat, unappealing and whiny, and where Sookie is nothing more than a simpering fool--you might enjoy this book.  In fact, when you search Dead Ever After in Amazon it lists it as a \\"True Blood Novel\\" and I couldn't agree more.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like that I can listen to the proper pronunciation of the word.<br />And of course the proper use of the word.<br />I especially like the origin of the word being listed whenever possible.
B007IK44CK|4.0|great action and story with the usual &#34;a bit hard to believe&#34; resources for the team that are always cool.
B004UHL9EK|2.0|Although the free version has ads, this version is less reliable. It constantly crashes, while the free one doesn't. Got this since I was so satisfied with the free one, but this one is nowhere as good, even though it's paid. The constant crashing is sooo annoying. It's not worth the price.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|I've read some of the reviews lambasting this reissue. I'm glad I ignored them! I always loved this album, but the CD that I've owned for years sounded awful to me. I would get listener fatigue with it.  It was bright, yet dull sounding. This release is a VAST improvement over that. It sounds full, yet not overly compressed. My only complaint is there are several dropouts from the master tape - particularly in Night in the City.<br />The music still stands!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first two books were very quick to read. This one took a little while to read it wasn't as catchy but very good indeed.
1118109791|3.0|I already owned a copy of the 12th Edition Review. I was hoping the 13th Edition comes with new questions but I was very wrong. The questions were mostly identical, I was very disappointed that I basically bought the 12th Edition again with very minimal new materials. The Integrated Reasoning questions are online and you need to register with the code provided with the book.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but parts of it were difficult to handle, the movie was spectacular and was able to put the rest in context.
B0057EYACI|4.0|Great colletion, nice packaging and notes, this artist hat a lot of great songs that were not played on radio, bonus cd had a couple of nice songs as well.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It's an interesting story with good plot shifts, but I don't know any people who act like this in real life.
B00005RFAI|5.0|i love this artist, is one of my favourites, so this disc is perfect for me, i know this disc is kind of old but i love the songs
B000P7V45S|5.0|The people who told you that Genesis sucked after Peter Gabriel left are wrong.  In fact, while A Trick of the Tail doesn't match the distinctive, intentional quirkiness of the PG-era albums, it may be the most even, well-rounded album the band ever made.  There aren't any weak spots. The 8 pieces here - mostly composed by Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks - cover a pretty wide range of styles: frenetic rock (\\"Dance on a Volcano\\"), beautiful balladry (\\"Ripples\\"), quirky pop (\\"A Trick of the Tail\\", \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\"), keyboard showcases (\\"Mad Man Moon\\"), and even Santana-esque instrumental rock (\\"Los Endos\\").  Phil Collins, while not as dominant at this point as he would be in the 80s or as Gabriel was, does an outstanding job as a vocalist.<br /><br />A must-hear for prog rock fans.
B009NY43NY|2.0|As I write this there are 933 opinions/ratings and it hasn't gotten 3 solid stars, is at 2 and a half. I need say no more.
B000002J29|3.0|This album is pretty much what you'd expect from a mid-to-late 70s rock live album, nothing more, nothing less.  At least until the late 90s, for many fans this was the only opportunity to hear some of the key Gabriel-era pieces performed live by the band (more recent archival releases, as well as greater circulation of unofficial recordings, have filled in this gap).  There's some controversy about Phil Collins's vocals here - some view them as great, others as blasphemy - but I think he does a fine job.  (And given how silly the lyrics to \\"Firth of Fifth\\" are, can you really blame him for hamming them up a little?)<br /><br />That said, eh.  If you've heard the original studio recordings, this double album won't add much value.  Most of the pieces get professional, competent, inoffensive interpretations with any initial rough edges shaved off. The second disc is stronger than the first - good performances of \\"Supper's Ready\\" and \\"The Cinema Show\\" as well as an intense medley of \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Los Endos\\".  I also have a soft spot for the closing section of \\"The Musical Box\\", which was my first encounter with this classic (I picked up Seconds Out before Nursery Cryme).  For some reason, the band chose to mostly ignore Wind & Wuthering material, and the sole exception (\\"Afterglow\\") gets a very anemic, almost pathetic, reading.<br /><br />I'm guessing that most fans will reach for the studio albums and rarely dig this one out.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|A wonderful historical fiction! This 4th in the series is one of my favorites. Can't wait to read it, don't want it to end am already looking forward to the next book!
B000002J2B|4.0|Genesis didn't stop making \\"prog rock\\" after Wind & Wuthering, for people who care about such things, but it's the last of their albums to be dominated by that style.  There's stuff here that's among the best music that Genesis ever made - \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\", \\"One for the Vine\\", \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\", \\"Unquiet Slumbers for that Unquiet Earth\\", and \\"Afterglow\\".  Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford were cranking out some great songwriting around this period, and Steve Hackett provides some of his strongest work with the group as a composer and guitarist.  The music in the middle of the album isn't quite as strong - \\"In Your Own Special Way\\" is not terrible, but kind of cheesy, and to most haters of 80s Genesis the first sign of the forthcoming popocalypse.  \\"All In a Mouse's Night\\" is not a very interesting tune and suffers from severe keyboard overload, something that would also drag on the album after this one (And Then There Were Three).  Still, those are pretty minor blemishes on what is a very good album.

1401907725|5.0|I use them daily to see something positive to focus on throughout the day- cards are beautiful but the messages on them and the book gives hope as you read them to yourself- In troubled negative times such as this, the readings filll you with hope begining in your own life
1449410243|5.0|Not 100% what I was expecting but worth the money.  If you enjoy the oatmeal you will enjoy the book.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|I thought I was going to be able to watch this off line on my tablet.  I thought buying it meant that it was downloaded for watching anywhere anytime.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|a great way to spend ones time.  game requires skill and tactics a lot of fun for all ages.  I have spent a lot of time playing and love the mission side of the game.
B002O2THRO|4.0|Had never seen the movie or read the book.  The picture with Redford and Farrow was really good; can't see how the 2013 version will improve on it but will see it to be sure.  To me Sam Waterston was the real star.  He was superb.  The costumes and scenery was perfect to depict the '20's.  I was surprised at the ending.  Won't tell for those who don't know.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I absolutely hated the first half of this book. I even considered not finishing it.  It was terribly boring.  The last half was suspenseful, psychotic and just downright strange.
B009R659L8|5.0|A fast paced book that will keep you guessing until the very end. Must read for a Clark followers who will enjoy tremendously the same plot and sub plot. Once I read page one, I was hooked and couldn't lay it down,
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Whoa! DH4 is so much better than DH3! Graphics are the same but, you can only go so far with that on tablet games. There are less glitches and more storyline that punches you in the gut with dialogue. THIS GAME ROCKS!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I hate it's not compatable with the le pan II tablet.  I love the game. After downloading and installing the app successfully, it crashes when attempting to open and play the game. I had to uninstall it since it didn't work.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very detailed description of settings and moods were set to places. I felt as if I would want to be a demigod myself, wishing there was something like that! Action well described, I LOVE this book always and forever, the only problem is that there aren't enough Percy Jackson books I need more to read!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought my first gaming console ever, a PS3, as it just seemed like something that would be fun at this point in my life (a pre-mid-life crisis)? The dualshock is the only controller I've tried but it works pretty great.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|My daughter loves Mario, so of course she liked this game too. However, she started getting annoyed by the time she reached world 5. I tried it and lost at the beginning of level 3.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|For a fan of the harry potter movies, this collection is great. All of the movies in blu-ray high quality.  My family has watched them all through a couple times and they're great.
0345803485|1.0|I loved all three books, i am hoplng that she writes more to this & keeps it  going, at first i was not sure adout it but as i went on i couldnt put it down, i even took it to work to read, if u didnt read them u should.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|The game was fun to start with.  Then of course it wants you to pay for it.  Why advertise that it is a free game???
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I couldn't get into this movie, so I stopped watching it half way through.  Maybe die hard Robert Downy, Jr. fans would like it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A wonderfully horrible book.  Just imagine what it would be like to have tapes detailing all the people and reasons why someone you knew committed suicide.  Now imagine that you are one of the people on the tapes and if you don't listen to them and pass them on that the truth about what you did will become public knowledge.  Imagine the agony of listening to tape after tape waiting to hear how your responsible for her death.  There's no one to try to talk out of making it public because the one person that could is dead.<br />This book is a great read for a health class.  It covers topics of drugs, drinking, sex, rape, and suicide.  This is an example of a book that presents adolescence with real life mistakes that can be lived out in a book and avoided in real life.  Also a great read for parents to open discussion with their kids about these topics.
B005J2V74C|2.0|The premise seemed very exciting.  I like to be scared, but not grossed out so I figured this movie would be tense but not gory.  I never thought about the language...eeesh!!  F-Bombs just about every other word and I found it highly offensive.  I stopped watching it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The writing was on the wall from the beginning. Charlaine Harris began the final novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series by preemptively apologizing to us.<br /><br />Not an auspicious start.<br /><br />If you read Dead in the Family, then you already know how Dead Ever After Ends. So my advice, then, is this: save your money. There is no reason to spend nearly $15 to find out what you already know.<br /><br />It's not that this book is written badly, necessarily, it's that nothing's a surprise. You know from reading the book-teaser that someone is trying to frame Sookie for murder, but surely you can guess that she is able to clear her name. Other than that, you can guess what happens with Bill, Eric and Sam. No huge shockers there.<br /><br />What did put me off a little bit was that all of the sudden, after 11 books, Sookie finds God. I mean, he was always kind of there in the background, but never so overtly mentioned as in Dead Ever After, and I've got to wonder why this became important here at the end. The only thing that can possibly come to mind is that the author is somehow trying to make it up to her diety, but for what, I don't know. Letting Alan Ball turn her series into an abortion? Phoning it in the last 3 books? I think, perhaps, that if somehow God did exist and he did read these books, he would've appreciated a quality end to the series far more than a dozen shout-outs.<br /><br />I'm glad Sookie ended up with who she ended up with and I'm glad the town showed her some support there in the end. Sookie got her justice. I just think it was about 3 books too long in coming.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I down loaded the game on a whim. It has challenges and requires a dexterous thumb. I find myself looking forward to the daily missions so I am able increase the multiplier and get a higher score.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought I'd be silly but it truly was a page turner. Once I got reading it couldn't put it down. I always wanted to know what came next. The characters were very well described and story was very detailed. This not only for kids but a good adult read as well. I loved them hated that they ended.
B008602KQI|4.0|Seen it a couple of times now, and it's overall a decent movie. I'm not familiar with the books, but I'm told it's a series.
B006YC74E8|4.0|This could potentially be one of the easiest to use photo editors for Android. The interface is simple to use and I like that it allows you to re-size by relative bit depth with a slider, or to do it manually. I haven't used many of the features yet so this review is a minimal 1st look. As an avid Photoshop user since its inception and Aldus Photo Styler before, I am anxious to find the perfect Android photo manipulation. The filters I tried seemed to work adequately and I was able to take a photo from within the app with no problem.<br /><br />That said,  I tried to use the Batch feature and had a problem accessing files, The customer support wrote back quickly and advised how to choose files. This will be a handy feature for resizing photos for the web. I would give it 5 stars if there were layer and transparency abilities. I will use this for the tasks it is strong in.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have always loved British TV.  Historical fiction at it's best! The characters engage, the landscape is breathtaking.  Brings back memories of living in England.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|This is just one of those CDs that you like to listen to when you want to relax.  It's good for so many occasions, like dinner, friends over for wine, or just to have on in the background.  If you like Brickman or Lanz - you'll like this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is way better then the first one in my opinion. I really really really like it because  of the zip lines and mining carts. The best of all their one big huge skull monkey:)
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is my most trusted author.  I can always count on her to keep be interested and entertained until the very last page.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I happened to watch the third season and couldn't wait each week to see what happened next ... I can't wait for the new season to start and for the addiction to start... Great acting to all....I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good acting masterpiece adventure.
193700788X|1.0|Ms. Harris, I really hope you are enjoying the massive amounts of money you sold your credibility and passion as a writer for. Thanks for taking a giant ****on the series  that brought you notoriety and tons of readers. I will use this as a reminder to never pick up one of your books.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|This is the movie I was looking for on this particular day at that paticular time! I was very pleased.
B0067EKYS6|3.0|My thoughts are all over the place on this version of \\"The Great Gatsby\\".<br /><br />Overall, this movie was only \\"OK\\" for me.  It felt exactly like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" except with a different storyline squished between the scenes of Nick Carraway writing/telling the story.<br /><br />The movie was narrated by Nick Carraway, just as the novel was told in his perspective, however, in this movie version, Nick has gone mad and is using the experience of writing the story as a means of dealing with his internal struggles.  If you have seen [[ASIN:B00005QZ7U Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], this premise will sound familiar, because it is exactly the same.<br /><br />In fact, the entire movie felt exactly the same as Moulin Rouge. The style was exactly the same which leads me to believe Baz is a One Trick Pony.  I felt that sort of style worked for a story like Moulin Rouge, but it didn't work as well in this version of The Great Gatsby.  There were even points where I felt Baz tried making this story comical and goofy.  It isn't a funny story, nor should it be.<br /><br />I didn't like how this movie spoonfed information to the audience.  There is no tension, no nothing.  For example, in this movie, Gatsby tells Nick towards the end that he really didn't come from money, that actually his parents were poor.  If I remember correctly, Nick actually doesn't know that until after Gatsby died and Gatsby's father comes to the mansion and is the lone guest at the funeral.<br /><br />I also didn't like that this movie seemed to try really hard to make Daisy a likable character.  Daisy shouldn't be a likable character.  She's a snooty-patoony rich girl who cares nothing about anyone other than herself and the things that she has.<br /><br />Furthermore, they made Nick's character weak by turning him into a drunk/crazy person in the loony bin.  Nick was stronger than that.  Baz was just recycling this framing device from Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />The only thing I really liked about this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby MacGuire.  The casting of these 2 characters was superb.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was only \\"ok\\" for me.  It was alright to see once, but I won't bother with the DVD or ever watching it again.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have really enjoyed these books for many years. But this one was so abrupt of a change from the rest of the series. Of course the last one was kinda off too but It's clear the author was just done. She probably had the &#34;end&#34; in her mind and that was what is was going to be either way. But to have been done well there would have had to be a book or two in between. It's almost like it was written by someone else.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What a great show! Great to watch with older children. Love this time period and setting! So glad to finally be able to download it straight from my own living room!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like that it is so clorful and entertains my daughter a lot. The different levels of it are amazing. Thanks for providing quality games.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It is a very enjoyable movie. It has great visual effects, and the story is very intriguing also. It gets you involved in the story, and it takes you along on the journey. Different is the word that sticks in my mind. Watch it and enjoy.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|alright game control is a little touchy suppose ill get the hang of it.wish it was a little easier to buy things. daily missions could be a little better
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|it was enjoyable-one bothersome fact i think i noticed-at the climax, the injurd and aging Agent is given a Task when parade is attacked but when the event unfolds it is Ding not Clark who takes that role-have i misunderstood? if correct, writing is good but editing questionable
B0091REZMW|3.0|hard to see very small asked to rate before I. really had a chance to play very much so I didn't rate it very highly
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Started playing cause I was bored with my other games, and I'm hooked, I think it's fun and my kids if I ever let them play will to. It's educational and fun!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a good easy read. I bought this due the low price and needed something light that I could read on the airplane.<br />It is definitely targeted at the female reader, but as a guy I still found it entertaining.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|Great productivity art program for android. The pressure sensitivity could use a bit of tweaking, fine to thick and thick to fine lines look a bit like sperm, hopefully this will improve in the future.
B00004Y87O|1.0|The movie was what I remembered<br /> (great action and classic Kurt Russel)<br /><br />but the video was so bad that I wonder if it was transfered from a 2 head vhs recorder to dvd??  It is really that bad!  Fuzzy, specs, and lines.  I would not recommend this DVD addition of the film as VHS would be a much better Quality option.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|At first I was a little hesitant about this game After starting though I was hooked. The graphics are well done. Glad for the hints though. You are going to need them.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Pretty good movie. I've never read the books but overall this movie was well scripted and put together. Love Jennifer Lawrence, she's so sexy
B0094BB4TW|5.0|All the other reviews are wrong, the news feed is fixed and working properly. You can do the same things in this app as the regular Facebook. I totally recommend this app if you have a Facebook.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Surprisingly true to the books (if a bit jumbled around), this TV series captures all the grit, violence, sex and intrigue that make Martin a Master of Fantasy.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was very entertaining, me and my wife enjoyed it immensely. Action, comedy, and love story all rolled into one
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Really enjoyed!  It took a while for me to get started on this book, but once I did I could not put it away.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you want a solid, probably unbreakable knife that takes an edge like a razor and holds it this is the survival knife for you.  I' amazed that Schrade could make it for so little money.  The only shortcoming is the sheath which seems downright cheap in comparison to the knife it holds.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the way it made me stop and think about my religion.  There are really no words that truly express how much I loved this book.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I haven't read a novel for a very, very long time but this book was about running and I love running so I decided to give it a try. And I found that for the first time in an even longer time, I had a hard time putting a book down. While the story involves ultra marathoners and even includes a chapter about running shoes and thus might seem to be about running to some readers, the real story is about how to live. And it really made me think more potently about that question than any other book that I've read. And I think it may change my life because its helped me realize that it's possible to enjoy whatever I'm doing, and to live, not for the outcomes of my labor but to live by finding the joy in all that I do. This story revealed to me a different way of living. I'd read about the importance of enjoying life before but it never made quite as much sense as it seems to now. For some reason this book reached me like no other. Maybe that's because it was speaking in a language I understand, in a context that makes sense to me-the endurance athlete. But I think it may also speak to others and I'd like to know if it does.  As I read what I've written I'm not sure it will make sense to anyone else. But then I'm not a poet or a novelist. And maybe this book won't have the same effect on you that it had on me. But if you are at all interested in running, or endurance, or finding your personal limits or learning how to live well I suggest you give it a try.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Really enjoyed!  Another great book that drags you in kicking and screaming before you know it.  Takes you be surprise.
B0045ODPKY|5.0|This movie is full of action that keeps you going, but without the nasty language that permeates everything today, and without the graphic gory bloodspurting.  Salt as an agent plows her way through opposition by knocking everyone out of the way.  Even when she blows them all up on the barge, they just fall over without body parts going everywhere.  Might sound odd, but this is a relatively peaceful piece of high-end action.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Not the greatest but good.  He is a remarkable writer and drags you in before you know it.  Please more.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Very illuminating look into one of rock's great creative talents. If you thought The Who were only a guitar-smashing band, think again!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love anything Hobbit and Tolkin was a great writer and had a great immigration.  Too bad there were not more.  He created a whole world.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Several have complained with issues/errors when trying to update. I got an error about signature not matching. My tip: uninstall the app then reinstall. That worked on my Asus Transformer. Love this app for listening to radio stations. Enjoy the shake feature to find new stations. So even though the app update process was flawed, the app still works. No need to give only one star.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I love the comedy mixed with zombie. I can't tell you how many time's I've watched this movie.

B000FC2PKG|4.0|An excellent crime thriller by a very good writer.<br /><br />This is my first Lisa Gardner novel, but won't be my last. I rather enjoyed this psychological crime thriller with its many twists and turns and a cast of highly interesting characters. A real page turner that kept me reading to find out how it ends.<br /><br />Bobby Dodge is a Boston SWAT team sniper who shoots and kills a husband holding his wife and son hostage with a gun. But is everything as it seems? Was Bobby manipulated by the wife, Catharine, into killing her abusive husband? His actions face police investigation. She was kidnapped and sexually abused as a child and to complicate matters, her abductor is out on parole and after her and her child, hired by Benefacor X.<br /><br />Here's where the novel fails a bit because Benefactor X is so obvious you know the culprit almost from the start and Gardner's suspense is lacking here. The end however is very exciting and offers a few surprises.<br /><br />The book is listed as a D.D. Warren mystery. She is a Boston female detective but is only a secondary character. Bobby Dodge plays a much more prominent part in this novel. I would have liked to have seen D.D. Warren play a larger role in the story. I think she was underused and underplayed by the author.<br /><br />It is for the above reasons I have given this book 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Still, overall it was a very good and exciting read and I'd read others by this author.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's very easy and I don't know how I started playing. I downloaded it for my little girl but ended up taking over when she's not interested.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Was excited to watch this movie and then had great disappointment. Mostly due to the bad video quality, and I paid for HD. I have good Internet, +/- 12 MB and still choppy. I won't be purchasing again ...
B0054SMID0|1.0|As a former legal assistant for many years, I met too many characters like this. He is arrogant and a shyster (as my Daddy used to say). Not interesting enough to bother watching. I would have hung in longer if the office-vehicle had been an old Lincoln Towncar used by an honest young attorney trying to establish himself. That could have been a good story!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It is a great time passer and interesting as well.....am looking forward to second one as well. Is really well thought out and makes you think.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|This is my favorite movie and musical. I love it. Price was right. I would recommend this to anyone. I love it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I honestly don't know that I have ever been so disappointed in a final installment. Whatever ending you had imagined to this series is better than what was written. It's as if the author of the series just gave up. If you were looking for a conclusion to the Eric and Sookie saga don't bother reading this book....Eric is barely in it. Every time she started to write in an Eric Sookie scene she stopped mid story.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I've always know England did away with slavery before America and without a war, but never knew details.  This is an inspiring story, and shows the efforts of a few can change the lives of many for good.
B008J34466|5.0|I can't believe Pink keeps putting out great albums. Every song is well written & Pink's vocals shine. I purchased this album the same time I got Taylor Swift's Red. This is so much better. Nothing against Taylor. Well worth buying this album.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This series is full of imagination and unexpected twists and turns.  After seeing it I bought the books and am now awaiting the next book and season 3!
B00C4U9U4Q|4.0|Just wanted to listen to somebody I didn't know about. Not a bad voice. Maybe 2 ok songs. I could take it or leave it. Nothing special.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was the best $7 I have spent so far. That's how good it is. Mojang has created the best app in my library. If you are considering buying, BUY !!! ITS GREAT !!!
B002QFYJF4|5.0|Please do NOT read this review if you have not seen the movie yet!  I would hate ruining someone's experience of a film, especially one I love this much.<br /><br />What I'm going to say will be obvious to many fans of the movie; my intended audience is those for whom the \\"frog sequence\\" was confusing or who thought it was some kind of pretentious cop-out.<br /><br />The rain of frogs--like the plagues God unleashed upon Egypt--represents divine judgement. You'll note that the only character who dies is the game show host, Claudia's father, the only one of the many \\"sinners\\" in the movie who is irredeemable. He isn't irredeemable because of his particular sin, but because of his refusal to admit what he did. (The closest he comes, when confronted by his wife, is in saying, \\"I don't know. I don't know what I've done.\\") It is true that he confesses his infidelity to Rose, but I'd argue this is because of his selfish need to unburden himself; Rose definitely does not profit from this knowledge.  His most serious sin he keeps to himself.  There can be no divine forgiveness without repentance. Thus, when he stands in his kitchen with the pistol to his head, preparing to take his life, a frog falls through the skylight and causes his death...death by God's hand rather than his own.<br /><br />Contrast his story with that of his \\"parallel character\\", the old man, Earl Partridge: as he lays dying, he confesses to his nurse how he wronged his wife and son. He seems to be confessing his worst sins, and he expresses true remorse for his actions. He is given a peaceful death with his long-lost son at his side. True, the son expresses his rage during this visit, but I would argue that this may have been the main reason Earl wanted him there: not just to apologize, but to give his son the opportunity to confront him, the hope being that this will allow him to put his bitterness in the past and make a new start.<br /><br />I don't mean to imply that Anderson is endorsing Christianity or any religion, only that a divine hand is present within this story. Why else would there be such skepticism in the voice-over at the beginning and end of the movie about coincidences that are not really only that, and chance events that are not merely a matter of chance?<br /><br />The rain accompanying the frogs sybolizes cleansing, \\"washing away sins\\", like baptism. The survivors are given another chance and a clean slate. Thus, Tom Cruise's character sees his stepmother, who he hated, in the hospital. Quiz Kid Donnie Smith is afforded the mercy of the cop, who allows him to replace the money he stole without being arrest. Claudia's mother is there to nurture her, and the cop loves her unconditionally. He wants only to be with her, help her to heal, and listen to her without judgement. He finally seems to understand how to put his Christian morality to use, and you get the idea he will be a much better, more discerning police officer for it. The young quiz kid, who we desperately don't want to end up a bitter loser like Donnie Smith, confronts his jerk of a dad: \\"You have to be nicer to me.\\" This gives the dad a second chance.<br /><br />A few reviews and comments I read on others' reviews stated that they would have preferred a rain of hailstones on a sunny day (or something similar) over the frogs, saying that it would have made the same point.  I think people object to something clearly supernatural being injected into an otherwise realistic story because it makes the movie hokey (in a different movie, I would probably feel the same way).  I would argue that hailstones, in and of themselves, are a natural phenomenon, and Anderson probably felt that whatever he used needed to be clearly supernatural in order to make his point.  He wanted no doubt in the minds of the characters or the audience that this occurrence was divine in nature.  This was more important to him than shying away from the eye-rolling it would inevitably cause for many viewers.<br /><br/>I love, love, love this film. I could write about it for hours.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|It can be my problem, but i just couldn't see the movie because of region restriction. Yes i did not check each technical specification af this disk. I was buying it at Amazon in Europe and it was shiped to EU country, probably somebody could remind me that there is some region issue because it is not in every disk from amazon and when i buy a disc in europe that could be played only in US, something could go wrong as it just happened to me. Thumb down amazon!
0679805273|5.0|great story for kids.  I bought this to get signed by all my kids teachers for every grade level and I will give it to them when they graduate. a must have!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it worked out perfect, the item arrived on time without any complications. Also, the movie is adorable and you can't go wrong with it.
0375714669|1.0|A rather whiney account of the authors tumultuous growing up years away from her home and parents. Liked #1 better.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I picked this book because it took place in Ireland, and I recently started learning Irish set dancing.  As it ends up, it's really a sweet book.  It will never be a classic, but has like able characters, and held my interest.
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|Movie felt like you were there with the character,great music background by Eddie Vedder, felt like you experienced surviviving in Alaskan wilderness.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is fun although very easy can't wait for new levels.thank you for creating a new game. I would like to see one done in maybe Greece or some other foreign country
B0024F08UG|5.0|Those of you out there ,who have seen this film on it original run, will love this blu ray transfer , well I do , I have the original double DVD SE release , which is good on any display under 1080p , sadly the audio was to my ears liking , stereo maybe. Now the &#34; Towering Inferno &#34; transfered to blu ray with some tweaking is &#34; Amazing &#34; The Video now true 1080p is so easy on the eyes and audio with your choice of &#34;DTS HD&#34; or stereo . what ever your ears or system<br />prefer ,<br />Thank You , For Oportunity .
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I loved the musical score and the acting was superb. Don't miss this movie.
1409136612|2.0|Very simplistic and brief....not her finest, but I believe it was her last.<br />Our Book Club thought it wasn't worth the effort.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This CD is great for a guy looking to please his better half. I would buy it again , You don't get tired of it, full of nuance.
0316078913|3.0|First let me admit, I find Sedaris very uneven. Some of his pieces go whizzing by me, and I fail to see the humor. Others are so perfect that I can't believe it's the same guy. (For instant he had a recent completely hilarious and brilliant piece on NPR about being forced to take guitar lessons. What's that from?) I got this collection after I heard that piece and the one about being a Macy's elf felt like the same genius. It's the jewel in the cvrowd here. Others, though, I couldn't finish reading. So take your chances here and take your pick. My guess is there is SOMEthing for almost anyone.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I totally love this show!!!  So awesome!!!  I would recomend this show to anyone that loves Action TV and Movies!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I know this game is intended for children but it's so relaxing I have yet to let my nephew play. The graphics are vivid and the colors are bright, I love it.
B006FE83UE|5.0|What a wonderful movie...  It has always been one of my favorites...  I bought this because I wanted to watch it with my 11 year old daughter...  She loved it too - it opened up some very good dialogue about a lot of things...
0307352153|4.0|An excellent book based on solid research. Well written and organized and thought provoking. I know that in the future I will certainly be paying more attention to my own quiet side, suppressed though it may be, as there much to offer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great. game app I was thrilled. when I saw games I played. as a young kid and always loved to play
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I've been an intensely passionate fan of Van Morrison's music for more than 40 years. I first discovered Van when he was fronting Them back in the late 60s and I was singing in a garage band and ripping off his songs (unfortunately, not his talent). Van is, I believe, the greatest singer/songwriter/performer of our generation.<br /><br />This album is not what I would call his greatest by any means (I'd have to go with \\"The Healing Game,\\" \\"Poetic Champions Compose\\" or \\"Hymns to the Silence\\" for that.) But this is still a great album that shows Van at the height of his vocal skills and at the pinnacle of his producing skills--this is a beautiful sounding album. Van remains one of the greatest producers of all time.<br /><br />\\"Open the Door to Your Heart\\" is a great opening song and it really fit my life when I first heard it (and it still does). We have a tendency as we get older to shut down parts of our emotions, to focus on the safe and easy, and this is Van's plea to keep the windows to your heart and soul open. A terrific song. \\"Going Down to Monte Carlo\\" is a wonderful song about Van tossing off the constraints of fame and just drifting into anonymity for a few days hanging out in Monte Carlo. You can picture him doing this, easily. And \\"End of the Rainbow\\" is as good as anything has ever recorded--it's in the Van Hall of Fame of great songs as far as I'm concerned. The lyrics blow me away, as do the sincerity of the vocals and that fine, fine, piano line just playing in and out of his vocals. This is a wondrous song. This is the genius of Van Morrison.<br /><br />There are a few songs on the album that I don't really crave to hear over and over, kind of blues-oriented songs, but who cares. When you have a genius like Van putting out great albums for nearly 50 years and he can still come up with this magic, you just say, \\"Thank you\\" and sit back and dig the music.<br /><br />Van is it, Van is i. Van is it. As Georgie Fame said on stage so many nights: \\"God Bless Van Morrison.\\"ss Van Morrison.\\"
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best season of the walking dead!! So bad  that merle and andrea wont be anymore on the serie.. Can wait for the season 4!
B000ID37RM|4.0|A movie that I hadn't seen in years.  Very much a classic.  Streamed through the WII with excellent quality.  The price couldn't be beat.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Saw it in the theaters at a midnight showing the night/day it was released, great job Peter Jackson, you're the best
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The characters were brought to life. The suspense was nice. The story line toward the end was a little predictable but still worth reading to the finish. The one thing I had a problem with was the endless detailed sex scenes. The sexual desire was necessary for the characters, however, the author went into so much detail every time, and there were numerous times to say the least, that the description of every sex scene became tiresome .
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you need (another) reason to love Tina Fey, read this book. It is a biography of sorts, told in short vignettes that are easily read. Definitely a book that will have you stifling your giggles as you read it at night, staying up way past your bedtime b/c you just want to read a few more pages. It does frankly (but not gratuitously) discuss sex and homosexuality. Besides adults I think it would be a good book for older teens, especially those that have had a hard time fitting in with the popular crowd. Enjoy!
0385349947|5.0|I was seeking advice and insight on building a rewarding career.  I thought about going to a professional coach but that was somewhat costly.  A colleague read and recommended this book so I thought I would see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed.  Sandberg shares her trials and tribulations of being a mother, wife and a successful executive with Facebook.  She delves into the challenges professional women encounter while pursuing their career e.g. failure to negotiate salary; making the &#34;right&#34; decision; believing in their ability to negotiate; etc.  The books is an interesting read as it is filled with humor, personal anecdotes, empowerment, and how to build a satisfying career.
1250006341|5.0|My wife has found this book to be the perfect gift for her close friends. All have enjoyed as much as the TV series.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole thing in about 4 days. It really gives you the perspective of someone who is struggling with life.
1400069807|5.0|Moss is a terrific writer and tells this story compellingly.  It provides insight into how the processed food industry makes its money while making us sick.  Knowing what they do can help release the reader from their grip.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was not wanting this series to end and now that it has so suddenly I am sad.  Made me cry.
0060507772|5.0|No matter what Terry Pratchett writes, it is excellent! Extremely imaginative, funny and yet seriously thought-provoking. Soul Music  was the first Pratchett book I read and I was hooked! Unfortunately my local library no longer carried his books! Can you believe it? So I went on line and bought every book he wrote and will read them over and over... and over.
B0076NAW48|3.0|Was hoping for some hot licks and good songs. There's a couple but in general quality is low and production is poor with overmodulation and undermix prevalent. Can't enjoy the music for the technical faults. Would not recommend.

B0095P31L6|5.0|I saw that this had a floundering score, so I wanted to include my two cents about it.<br /><br />This movie is about two things:  Figuring out who you are, and about old school Clint Eastwood movies.  It happens to be animated, but that's really not the point.<br /><br />I think that superficially, kids would be okay with it.  But on the deeper level, where you start getting the jokes and whatnot, it's great for adults.<br /><br />It really is very well done.
0316098515|5.0|The layout of the recipes seem intuitive enough given the complexity of the food.  I would only recommend this book to someone who enjoys cooking enough to spend several hours preparing a meal.  My girlfriend and I bought it as a souvenir of our trip to NYC and of course dining at Eleven Madison Avenue itself which was phenomenal.  I can't wait to try some of the recipes.
B007SUW24W|5.0|^That was meant to be a compliment. Ed Sheeran is one of the most persistent and talented singer/song-writers to come out of any country - and having a British accent is a bonus. His songs resonate of pure emotion and passion that you can hear through his angelic singing. He mixes up different paces and genres successfully (from the slow and passionate &#34;Kiss Me&#34; to a pride-driven rap &#34;You Need Me, I Don't Need You&#34;) and his lyrics are pure genius that could make any girl (or guy for that matter) turn into a puddle (&#34;I could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle&#34;). His songs touch the hearts of many that can relate to the wondrous feeling of young love and sadly, heartache, and because of that - plus his charm and sweet tenor voice - his album is definitely an A+.
0345803485|5.0|50 shades of greys  is my first english novel, and i realy loved it. I cant stop to read it.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|At first it as great, then it just stopped working, it wouldn't turn or respond.  I believe if I'm not mistaken it was trying to get me to purchase additional upgrades for it.  I actually need to delete it. Too bad it was very cute for my grandson to play.
B008D28HYS|4.0|love this game. reminds me of picross from nintendo. lots of fun. would be nice if it separated the color levels so u can place x's and they wont interfere with the pic.
B0049U4NQO|1.0|No spoilers here, but this is a horrible end to the series. These are books for KIDS.....can't it have an intriguing and interesting ending? A motivating series, especially for boys, I think that the last book forgot its mission....excuse the pun. I think that the author started taking the stories too seriously and forgot who his audience was.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great it is way better then Tempel run and its free what's not to like about this game
B000IHSKSY|4.0|Replaced these shoes after two years with the exact same pair. They were a little tight at first, but now they are broken in. I love them.
1439192812|5.0|This is a vary well written book almost text book. I find this a good book for my children and it helps so they can better defined themselves so they can enjoy their freedom from religion.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Richard Farnsworth, the main character in this story is an excellent actor who plays the role of a quiet, thoughtful man who is aware that his life, plagued by cancer, is limited.  Wanting to finish up any business before he leaves the earth, he recalls the argument that separated his brother from his close company.  The argument isn't discussed, but whatever it was isn't as important to him as the reality that he hasn't seen his brother, once his close companion, in many years.  Eventually, after many plans, he decides to travel to his brother who lives in another state to reconcile with him.  Cissy Spacek is the &#34;slow&#34; daughter who takes care of his home.  She isn't pleased that he will journey on his own a great distance to see his brother.  The last scene is priceless and worth seeing the movie.  A story about forgiveness.  Anna M. Seidler
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An amazing serious. Unpredictable at every turn. A surprise at every turn. Not even sure what to read now that will be able to hold my interest as well as The Hunger Games did. A must read!
0345803507|5.0|This was the best book of the series.  I would recommend this book to adult readers. Get it read it, draw your own conclusions
B009NY43NY|3.0|Ending disappointing. But overall a lot of stuff for a book to end. And it was pretty good. Like it not loved. But enjoyed the read. U
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I think it a bit disturbing that the film industry is using more and more teen-aged and younger people to portray such violent characters/roles in the movies these days. Frankly, I am tire of seeing young people in almost every movie now. Yes, I am an older person (mid-40s), but it seems that it is hard to find good movies with people who are not teen-agers starring in roles. Just sayin'  ;). But all in all, it was an okay movie. I wouldn't watch it again, though...
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Love it good movie will watch again.<br />Good family movie<br />wish they would make a second movie like this one
B002QEXN2K|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME!!!! ABSOLUTELY AWSOME. RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES JOHN MAYER.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|I love jeremy renner so much~ he is so amazing in the town. I think this new ending is better than theater version
B005RJ6DUK|4.0|The tale was interesting,  the QUALITY OF THE RECORDING IS SUBSTANDARD, the color faded in and out throughout the viewing, distracting and minimized enjoyment.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had already seen the movie before reading the book as a free loan on my Kindle, but the book filled in the details that I realized were lacking in the movie plot.  Definitely an entertaining and engaging read, and I've already borrowed the next book in the series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating because the book was exciting to read and with each turn of a page, you figured out something new and was introduced to an New adventure. What I like the most is when the 7 chosen demigod came together, it just was amazing. The worst part of the book might have been when they go to Atlanta. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading adventurous and mysterious books.
0307460444|5.0|Great cupcake book for cupcake lovers. There are many different possibilitiies: chocolate, low fat and a wide variety of these small cakes. I highly reccommend it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|One if not the best modern western i have ever seen . I almost fell off the couch ! More blood than I expected .
B000WNQCG6|4.0|This is perhaps the movie that put Federico on the worldwide map, many knew about him before but La Dolce Vita made him a master of the silver screen. Later when he acquired fame and fortune he became sloppy-to my taste. E La Nave Va is a good example that Fellini did not care much for his audience nor the critics at this point. I cannot find a real meaning or message in La Nave other than his own philosophy of  'E tuto escrementi'. Nothing is worth anything, I guess once you achieve his level of popularity and wealth you can afford the luxury of making such statement. Yet, most of his films reach the status of a genius film director. We miss you Federico.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I've always loved lego, but this would have to be one of the best Lego sets I've ever seen, great design and a very stable structure when it's fully built, I certainly recommend this lego set to anyone, great collectors item.
B001GJ3BPU|5.0|If you are a fan of the comic this movie is five stars. If you're not, well you may not agree. If you want to see Elektra shine - follow this up with the Marvel version of Elektra - Jennifer Garner's acting matured for the better since the Dare Devil film.
B00AA0RZZI|5.0|It felt good to listen to these CD's in the privacy of my car during long rides. Excellent story. I loved each and every tape.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I discovered this book at the bookstore when the cover caught my eye, but it wasn't until a few months later that I decided to give this book a try. And right from the beginning I was hooked. This book was so captivating, and the photos made the book feel like historical fiction, which is my favorite kind of book. I definitely would recommend this book, and can't wait to see what happens next.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I love it when movies pass late 20-somethings and early 30-somethings off as college students. Once you get past that in this movie, you're fine. I was expecting a laugh riot, but it didn't quite deliver that. Still, it was plenty funny and held my attention nicely.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I can never get enough of Terry Pratchett and his characters. It is hard not to laugh  out loud while reading this.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I expected this book to be a little better. At times the book seemed to flow and at other times it seemed to just drag on.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I feel that this is the best album by any female rapper thus far. people should know that it has two discs of music and includes a dvd all for one amazing price. she has some of her best work in this re release.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVE JUST BECAUSE IF THE TITS LOL SORRY TO TELL THE TRUTH, BUT YES IT WAS A GOOD ONE HAVE TO SEE!!
B00CHILW64|5.0|The movie was very good. Too bad Naomi Watts did not win the Academy Award for her performance. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The Merriam-Webster dictionary app is really good. It is current and very easy to use. I definitely recommend this app.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does a good job very well for a basic app. Most applications only need simple or rudimentary functions and this app fills the need very well.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Buble is tops of his generation when he goes to the \\"Great American Songbook\\"--sadly, when he steps away from it, he is reduced to the mediocre--at best.  His compositional contributions here are, frankly, bland to wretched, but then again, when he hits the GAS--he is at \\"full tilt.\\"  Nobody should feel forced into stasis--that he chooses to go somewhat mainstream with--well, too much frequency for my taste--is no sin.  He wants to develop, and this is only right.  However, I hear regress and not progress.  He is young, so this not a sign of devolution--it is just a messy side-street escapade.  For serious listeners, let's see where he ambles nest.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I have recently viewed several documentaries on food and how our food comes to market.  It makes me sick.  I am doing everything possible to get off the manufactured food grid.  It is slow suicide to eat the majority of food products that our traditional grocery business model provides.  So few options.  Options are hard to find.  More of us need to demand food produced right and grown organically.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|This is, of course, the kind of horror story in music Luhrman wanted to create to generate the kind of relationship that existed between the bourgeois of the twenties and \\"black\\" jazz and....while interesting on paper, it is distancing and even nauseating on film.  As a cd, certainly the appeal will be to the undeveloped ear--which is to say the infantile head, irrespective of age.  As this is not the place for a review of the film, just know this, listener, if you have a penchant for Fitzgerald and the historicity of HIS vision, then this will not be the cd for you.  If you just want a soundtrack of \\"crap\\" from a remarkable set of unversed, untalented, and probably very wealthy performers (that is the best they will ever be), then this is the cd for you.
B004X0Y5GI|3.0|I love Stevie Nicks voice no matter what she sings.  This cd was good but lacked the tortured soul type songs that defined her through the 70's.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I'm not a huge game player. And when I am in the mood to play one, it's hard to find one I like.  This game has kept me entranced for two days.  I even stayed up into the wee hours playing because I didn't want to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter love's this game. She likes how it changes places and the graphics.  She says it's a must have!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book,also saw the movie. Very much holds your interest. Great author. Read some of his other books. Wonderful.
B008MM9630|4.0|Fun and adorable great for young and easy to play anyone can learn to play and have fun while playing. It's not just for girls either boys can play too!
B003R0LBVW|5.0|I hesitated to buy this book because several reviews described it as wordy and over-described.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my love for relationship problems forced me to read it, and boy were my hesitations unfounded. Yes there is a lot of detail, but all of it brought me closer to the relationships in play. The main relationship involves a marriage whose husband loves his wife more than she loves him. Offshoots include the wife's less than perfectly reciprocated interest in the husband's best friend and the loyal husband's quandary over whether to return affections from his much younger (and much more interested) assistant. If that's not enough, the husband and wife have one-sided relationships with their two kids, who turn around and start up one-sided relationships with others.<br /><br />And this didn't only have the relationship oriented, slice-of-life premise I look for. It also had plot, rising action, climax and resolution. I stayed interested in what would happen next through all five hundred and seventy-two densely worded pages.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|If you have just got yourself a GoPro Hero 3 and mainly use it for scuba diving, I would STRONGLY recommend this purchase. This filter made a huge difference on my video with/without filter. But of course, if you are planning to use it in &#34;deeper&#34; water (20m+) and also expecting your footage to be great, then I would get a dive video/photo light instead. This works great at an amateur level.
B00AO7HQ06|4.0|I found some of the early material not to be as good as I thought it might be.  But the Allman Brothers' songs, together with Duane's session work, was very nice.  The booklet is good, and the perspective of Duane's daughter Galadrielle was interesting, also.<br />  The container for the CD, which is a simulation of a guitar case, is very novel, and I do not know of another CD box like it.<br />  Of course, the CD makes me wish we had Duane Allman for a longer time, and I wonder what he would have sounded in another ten, twenty or more years.<br />  A friend told me about the Ronnie Hawkins material in the 70's, and I think it is still tops! R.I.P. harmonica player Richard Newell (the King Biscuit Boy).
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I have taken my GoPro to two of my recent dive trips and I wish I had a screen. Finally after finishing editing the second video I have decided this purchase. I have yet to test it out for my next dive trip but playing with it so far I know that I have made a good choice especially the GoPro is a point and shoot camera so sometimes you need to know what you pointing and shooting, plus making sure your footage are in focus! But if you are using the GoPro as a mount camera I guess this would not be much help.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thought this was a compelling & well written novel & brings light to a terrible truth.  I highly recommend it.

B005ERIRZE|5.0|If you seek the answer to willpower challenges, you'll find them here. There is no quick cure-all, but we are all endowed with the hopeful attributes of an evolved brain and a shiny new morning every day. They keys lie in the repeated focus on self-awareness. But I think the author misses one point related to the ironic rebound; it is often easiest to forget our bad behaviors when we not only give ourselves permission to feel our anxiousness, cravings, and other foibles, but also when we focus on the condition of others, not just our own inner and outer reality. Volunteerism, caring for others, meaningful work, and community building all can have the effect of giving one alternative mental focal points. So self-awareness is required; self-absorption is not. The bottom line is telling, and similar to the conclusion of Jonah Lehrer's book, How We Decide, also a riveting book on brain activity. &#34;Thinking about thinking matters.&#34; There is hope for all seekers. And modern science can now confirm what many of our wise grandmothers were trying to tell us.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Love this movie.  I  had let some one borrow it, never to see it again, so I had to repurchase

B005SLS3VY|3.0|Good general legal thriller with interesting role reversal subplot. I am sure his other books are smarter and with more substance.
0060987464|5.0|An enjoyable read about one of the biggest shock rockers out there.  Of course, there needed to be a twisted and dark story behind Marilyn Manson, and Manson does a good job of describing one that fits him.  Some of my favorite parts of the book include where he describes the extreme frustration surrounding the creation of Antichrist Superstar.  In my opinion, this comes out as the most honest part of the book.  Manson shows that successful creative works don't always grow out of inspired times, but indeed sometimes grow out of very dark periods in one's life.  Being a former resident of New Orleans, it was especially cool to hear him describe NOLAs effect on him.<br /><br />The story about how the band formed is interesting because it highlights that Manson and his friends were just a bunch of street punks (petty theft, drug use, etc.).  It sometimes surprised me how little MUSIC was actually involved with the formation of MM.  Even more surprising that Manson didn't even play an instrument when he formed the band.<br /><br />Despite Manson's awesomely cool story, I've always found his whole \\"worm turned into angel (or whatever)\\" thing as a bit cheesy and thin.  Luckily, he doesn't go into too much depth about that.<br /><br />All in all, FIVE stars because the book is an immensely entertaining read written by one of the most extreme entertainers of our time.  It accomplishes its mission of being a fun read.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The sonic screwdriver is awesome! I am a huge whovian and when I found this I knew it would be perfect! I love the pen and invisible ink part the most! This is a very durable product and it's super fun too! I would completely give this product 5 stars!

B001EOQWFI|5.0|After my other copy decided it didn't want to work I bought this. So glad I did. Was well worth it
B0071XO8RA|3.0|OK, I had heard sosososososo much about how awesome and amazing this book series is. And I probably would have agreed with that while reading the first part. Part two knocked my opinion down a little, then a bit more with each part after that, until I hit the last 20% where I was literally skimming the pages just to get it over with.<br /><br />I'm fine with Howey's unconventional shift in characters in the beginning, because I was impressed with how quickly he made me care about the characters. Until Juliette came along and even though she was a good, strong character, I just never connected with her. And Lukas was completely flat for me.<br /><br />There were also too many issues for me, things that didn't line up for me. I don't believe for a second no one ever refused the cleaning--the reason given for them to follow through makes no sense to me. Not going to detail out my reasons here, but I promise I understood what was happening. The reasoning behind a lot of characters' reactions and some of the society's systems didn't make sense to me either--they just weren't logical. And the ending just made me insane. Pages and pages and pages of Juliette and the damn suit and swimming and crossing back to Silo 18...and the whole climax of the novel takes place without her and is just summed up in a few paragraphs?<br /><br />Lastly, I only read a few of other reviews, including one negative one that called Wool a knock-off of The City of Ember. I have to admit, that is exactly what I kept thinking the whole time I read it: \\"City of Ember for grown-ups.\\"<br /><br />I gave it three stars because that's what it'd average out over the whole novel. The shorter beginning parts were more like 4-5 stars, but the longer later parts dragged on and had sloppier writing, so my rating would have plummeted down to 2 stars by about 3/4 of the way through.<br /><br />Anyway props to Mr. Howey for the sensation he's created, but I'm done with the series.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|5 rating is too small it should be 10<br />The set's were wonderful!<br />Everyone will enjoy this love story indeed.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|In 1991, audiences around the country were stunned by Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-winning performance of caged cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the movie adaptation of Thomas Harris' thriller &#34;The Silence of the Lambs.&#34;  The 2002 movie prequel &#34;Red Dragon&#34; gave viewers a glimpse of the caging of Dr. Lecter by FBI profiler Will Graham.<br /><br />The new NBC series &#34;Hannibal&#34; turns the clock back ever further and asks the provocative question, &#34;What if Dr. Lecter, prior to his caging, was actually assisting the FBI -- assisting *Will Graham*, in fact -- in catching serial killers?&#34;<br /><br />Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) is a troubled man. He's borderline autistic, but this gives him an ability to see into the dark reaches of serial killers' minds.  FBI Behavioral Unit Chief Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) wants to exploit Graham's ability to catch these killers before they kill again. But Graham needs a psychological anchor, a source of stability who will keep him from going as insane as the killers he chases. Enter psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), whose knowledge of the mind is perhaps surpassed only by his devotion to the culinary arts and his willingness to personally procure the type of meat he enjoys most....<br /><br />Viewers be warned: This series is NOT for the faint of heart (or stomach). I've been an off-and-on viewer of &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; and a reader of serial killer fiction (including Thomas Harris' &#34;Red Dragon&#34;, &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;, and &#34;Hannibal&#34;, all of which I highly recommend) for years, but the second episode of the series nearly grossed ME out. The series spares no expense on blood, flesh, gore, and surrealistic combinations of all three in nightmarish sequences that might give you nightmares yourself. But if you can stomach it, &#34;Hannibal&#34; is an AMAZING series filled with vibrant performances -- a superior &#34;killer of the week&#34; show with a rich mythology and visceral (sometimes literally) undertones. And the biggest treat is knowing that if the show lasts long enough, faithful fans may get to see a new version of &#34;Red Dragon&#34; performed by the current cast! So have a barf bag ready if you must, but WATCH THIS SHOW!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun. It's better than - dare I say it? - temple run! Even temple run get boring after a while. But, this game is different. It's just a lot of fun. You get to go to different places, such as Rio, Sydney, and Tokyo. It's great. You also can collect different characters, and a special bonus one for whatever city you are in in the game. Highly recommended.

B009NY43NY|1.0|This was a terrible ending to a series that I loved. The characters are not at all true to the characters we have seen throughout the series. It was like someone read a few notes on the characters and tried to write a bare bones book that tied up all of the issues of the previous books with a pretty red bow.As an avid reader and fan of Harris I feel like we all deserve a letter of apology for the extreme let down of this book. This book should be thrown out and rewritten in the true nature of a Sookie novel.
0345803485|1.0|Fifty shades of Grey was originally developed as a \\"Fan-fiction\\" of the Twilight series called \\"Masters of the Universe\\". It was reworked and retitled as \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". So all of the complaints about it being imature fantasy garbage. WELL DUH that's exactly what this woman is selling. The main character (Grey) much like Edward Cullen is every woman's dream boat, while the female character (Anastasia Steele) is as much of a bafoon as Bella Swan.<br /><br />They are going to make this into a movie and rank in tons of cash from immature female viewers, just like they did with Twilight. Well good for them. Both the authors of Twilight & Fifty Shades of Grey have excellent talent. The talent of separating fools from their money.<br /><br />As a black man I think I am going to write an \\"Urban Version\\" of these books called \\"Real Love\\".

B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I really did not know what to expect from Lady Antebellum's fourth studio album \\"Golden\\" after they released their hit single \\"Downtown\\" as this song established a different root for the group. Hillary Scott does a great job bringing out the sassy side of her, but it's a song that one would probably find on a modern pop than a country radio station. However, Lady A does the song justice through talented vocals and various instruments.<br /><br />Although the group approached this album differently, \\"Golden\\" did \\"Get to Me.\\" Yes, there are less duets and harmonization, but the album still has the Lady A roots that their fans fell in love with. It is a lighter-heartfelt album compared to their previous releases, but that's what they were aiming for, and they did a great job. There is not one song that I don't love. A few standout songs are \\"Get to Me,\\" \\"Can't Stand the Rain,\\" \\"All for Love,\\" and \\"Generation Away.\\" This album may not be as strong as \\"Need You Now,\\" but \\"Need You Now\\" will always be their strongest work, and fans need to stop comparing every release to that one. Every good musician matures and experiments with new sounds and approaches and sometimes those new approaches can burn their careers, but I do not see that with Lady Antebellum. \\"Golden\\" is polished and well thought out. I am very impressed with this release.

193700788X|1.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Honestly, I've never felt inclined to write a book review until now. I truly have loved this series and have read every book within a day of getting it- The last few have gone significantly downhill, but nevertheless I held out hope for the conclusion of my favorite series.  What a travesty.  I knew Charlaine has always said Sookie would not become a vampire, but with the steady development of her and Eric's relationship I couldn't figure out how she could keep them together for the end game.  In the same respect, I could not imagine them separating in the final book of the series because it would just be so out of no where.  Apparently, Charlaine did not feel the same way.  She really mutilated all of her characters and left them beyond recognition.  After reading this book, I feel like I need to start reading fan-fiction just to get out of this state of utter disappointment and serious disbelief.  How could an author make such incredible characters only to completely change themselves in the finale?  I just don't get it...  I realize she has always wanted Sookie with a human and to have babies etc. and I could even live with that, but it needed to be built up to, not just forced down our throats.  If she wanted Eric gone, do it with more than three weak scenes- Resolve the hurt and confused feelings.  How can you pretend that he's just going to be ordered off to Oklahoma and take it like a... Well, you know.  And Bill.  Even he barely resembled himself in the few chapters he showed up in.  Pathetic.  As soon as I finish writing this I am cancelling the follow-up garbage book that comes out in October.  Ms. Harris doesn't deserve another dollar of my money.  I truly thank her for creating the characters and for writing with the passion she did in the beginning of the series, but it is evident that ended when the money started pouring in and the pressure for more books piled up.  What a shame and a waste.  Dedicated readers of this series deserved a proper ending to Sookie's story, and evidently the only place they will find one now is in fan-ficition.ved a proper ending to Sookie's story, and evidently the only place they will find one now is in fan-ficition.

193700788X|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />It was just very blah for me. While I expected Sookie to end up with Sam at some point, it happened too quickly. There was no build up. Just BAM together. The drama was a bit of a reach too. I gave it 3 stars because I love the series, and I don't want new readers to be discouraged by one book.

B005LAIIJY|4.0|Typically bizarre Quentin Tarantino movie! I hated to see the German character get whacked even if he was standing up for principle but the movie was otherwise 'satisfying' in a strange way. the Samuel Jackson character was particularly disturbing but likely an historically accurate characterization. De Caprio is likely a good representation of the era- funny how he likes the title 'monsieur' but can't speak French... sadly, not a bizarre characteristic limited to the 19th century.

193700788X|1.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />All these years of giving Charlaine the benefit of doubt when she told fans she \\"doesn't use an outline, she's a 'pantser', she cares little for continuity, and that she's 'ready to move on'\\" - it was never more evident than in this book.<br />The writing is lazy, and tired, and it lacks anything even remotely exciting. Charlaine forgot her own world rules, and the continuity issues were abundant. Just like Sookie's tomatoes. *groan*<br />The third person omniscient POV was jarring and took me right out of the story.<br />A devil but not THE devil. Wut? Why do I care? I don't.<br />Sookie has lost her joie de vivre, her essential spark, her quirkiness. She went from Sookie Stackhouse to Sookie Crocker. The effort to show \\"normalcy\\"  was overkill.

She could have even done it after the BB was broken.  Sigh. She didn't. She waited until the very last book to pull the rug out and slip the collie in. It didn't work. It. Does. Not. Work. It felt like a 'bait and switch' tactic.You can't thrive on the shipper feelings of your readers for years and then pull the plug and run off with the money and expect people to be okay with it. Sam gets the girl by default.

B0098460O4|5.0|I won't add to what everyone else has said--I've also been following them since 'discovering' them on BGT only about a month ago.  The power, sympathy, and pure pitch perfection (to my 'amateur' ear) of their voices is just incredible--and incredibly moving.  I'm a 57 year-old career military officer and my only contribution is this--there needs to be a safety warning on this CD that you shouldn't play it while driving.<br /><br />At least, I can't, but I've only listened to them about 100 times or so.  Maybe when I get up to 5,000 it'll be ok.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I do not have much to add, except that it was a very disappointing book! slow and poorly executed, as someone pointed out in reviews with a villain would sell his soul to the devil to get a desire to acquire a magical object to get a wish? wtf? this was a serious error and ridiculous. if I wanted to read about shopping, tomatoes, gardening, etc, I would read my list of tasks, dull and unworthy of the last installment of a series of 13 years! I expect to go out with a bang (even though I was not happy about everything), but not with a hiss. I'm sad but I'll move on about it eventually, but I'll never buy books that author again.

Blink is the same story written about 10 times throughout the book and i gotta say it doesn't go into depth on how to become a subconscious thinker even though all of us at heart are subconscious thinkers in the first place, just depends on what degree. plz don't waste your time with the rest of this book if u didn't like the museum, statue story in the first 15 pages.

0385349947|3.0|Though Sandburg acknowledges and speaks gratitude for her life's opportunities, her one-size-fits-all prescription for women to lean into opportunities, work hard, and be themselves for &#34;success,&#34; is massively undercut by her own lack of self-awareness about both: how very limited her privileged perceptions of others's lives and opportunities are; and of how much &#34;leaning in,&#34;working hard, and willingness to lead most  women without even a toe on a first rung of ladder of success/leadership are already putting forth, all to no avail, or even to their harm.<br />Her intentions may be good, but the book is immature, and extremely thin gruel when compared to a much more substantive, meaningful and helpful Steinem, Abzug, etc.<br />She has, however, learned to write in short, simple sentences when attempting to beckon her masses to follow her lead.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Love it!  From the comical video scenes to the hard rocking, classic progressive rock tunes, you won't be disappointed!  I've been a Rush fan since I was a wee lad and my then teenage son was following in my footsteps.  I took him to this concert several years back and he was thrilled with the live performance!  This collection embodies everything from that live performance in stunning blu-ray picture quality and crystal clear and lifelike dts-HD surround sound.  It includes some of the old classics like &#34;2112&#34; to more recent cuts like &#34;Workin' Them Angels.&#34;  If you're already a Rush fan, I'm sure you'll love it!  If you're not a Rush fan, you might just become one after seeing this concert!  For some strange reason, I'm craving broasted chicken right now!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I expected this to be only 'popular fiction'.  It's so much more!  So well written, so many surprises.  I kept reacting with audible gasps.  Enjoy it!
B0002VF5VG|5.0|A wonderful YES performance!  I was trying to find this on Blu-Ray but to no avail... Nevertheless, the  DVD picture quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie was really good. It was very funny too! I really enjoyed it. I will recommend this movie to all of my friends!!!!
B00000DQWT|3.0|Pat Metheny has composed soundtracks for several movies, this is one of them.  The soundtrack was composed for John Schlesinger's film of the same name, not a too impressive film for me.  The nine songs in the album are performed by Pat Metheny Group, the highlight being  &#34;This is not America&#34; which is sung by British rock star David Bowie.  All songs in the album were composed by Pat Methney and his long time partner Lyle Mays, and of course there is a touch of Pat Metheny Group sound which you would recognize at once when the first note floats in the air.  Still a very listenable album, though not at their best.
B007IK44CK|4.0|The makers of this film did not try to hide the complete ridiculousness of this movie, which I can respect. The plot is unbelievable, the gadgets are silly, and the scenarios are far fetched. Still I enjoyed it. A pretty good action flick.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love these old fashioned novels that tell such an intriguing story.  Can't wait for the next 2 and to go back and read some others.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Flynn's characters are often flawed individuals and reading their thoughts can be disturbing.  At times you can have empathy for a character, but then he or she does something that can change your mind. Dark Places was a mystery until the very end of the book, but it had a satisfying ending.
0385523912|5.0|This is a well written book, and the personal stories I am afraid are true. One must understand that under such dire conditions the normal rules of society no longer apply. I have read an anthropological survey of 500 societies across the globe and it believe me, the stories in Barbara's book are well within the realm human experience. From this book I found that North Koreans are human beings just like everyone else. Also, if you could please make a donation to one of the North Korean refugee organizations. They need our help.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was a great read!  The details were amazing and since I live in West Virginia it made it much more interesting.  Now I'm reading &#34;The Forgotten&#34; which is the sequel to this book.  I highly recommend &#34;Zero Day&#34;  you won&#34;t be disappointed.
B008I34YYY|1.0|Julia Dietze was cute.  Everything else pretty much sucked. Now that the CIA can not water-board, perhaps they can use this film as a new form of torture.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I have nothing to add to all the review other then I concur that this is one of the best bond movies.
B000002KIT|4.0|During the great live album glut of the 70's, it seemed every band had a double live set in their back pocket. Thanks to Peter Frampton and Kiss proving that not only could you break a not quite successful band to commercial success, but you could sell these records in tonnage, everyone from Lynyrd Skynyrd to The Tubes were putting their act on disc for all the world to listen to. For the really good ones, it could help define the band. \\"Live and Dangerous\\" did just that for Thin Lizzy.<br /><br />Having broken in the states thanks to \\"Jailbreak,\\" there was a lot of talk that Lizzy's studio work just didn't measure up to the band's, and especially the late, charismatic frontman Phil Lynott's stage presence. Recorded in London (1976) and Toronto (1977) for the tours supporting \\"Johnny The Fox\\" and \\"Bad Reputation\\" respectively (and like many other 70's live acts, heavily touched up in the studio), the band was at their creative peak. That means you get stunning versions of \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"Don't Believe a Word,\\" you also get songs like Bob Seger's \\"Rosalie\\" and some should have been hits like \\"Dancing In The Moonlight\\" and the lighter \\"Still In Love With You,\\" where Lynott's presence shines through.<br /><br />This was also the prime Lizzy lineup: Lynott, Brian Downey, Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham. Thin Lizzy knocks these songs out with the kind of energy fanatics knew was missing from the regular albums. The twin guitars are set for stun, and Lynott's underrated bass playing pins it all together. Interband troubles would start after this release in 1978, so this marks the close of a chapter in the band's history, covering many of the major songs from the band's catalog. If all you know of Thin Lizzy is \\"The Boys Are Back In Town,\\" then \\"Live and Dangerous\\" is a great introduction to a great rock band whose career was ultimately cut short too soon.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|There seems to be a little too much emphasis on nudity and sex. I am not a prude and don't mind explicit scenes at all, but the sheer amount of it makes it seem borderline pornography at times.  That makes the selection of people I would watch it with shrink, which is a shame because I would love to invite more people over for Game of Thrones marathons.  They are doing a really good job with it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|however, I found the portrayal of the characters to be repulsive. The writing is excellent, but the vulgarities were too excessive for my taste.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Good basic fun. I didn't think I would enjoy Elementary since I get my fix with BBC's Sherlock, but it is pleasantly different and beats most stuff on tv.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It has beautiful graphics, changing scenery, and can be played for extended periods of time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite reads so far this year. Then when I saw the movie and how it completely butchered this book, I think I loved it even more.<br />Pat Peoples has been in a rehab for people with some sort of mental health issues.Well, not really but that is how it seems at first. But he isn't showing any progress, so his mother gets him released and brings him home. We don't really know at the time why and Pat doesn't either. He has no memories of why he was there, so the reader doesn't know either. We only know what Pat knows and a bit more as we are able to pick up on clues that he doesn't. All Pat knows is that he is separated from his wife, Nicki and that their \\"time apart\\" will end when he is good enough for her. Pat embarks on a training regimen that could put an Olympic athlete to shame. He is also reading books from Nicki's high school teaching syllabus in order to be able to discuss this with him. Pat also sees a doctor, Cliff, who doesn't judge Pat. Pat's father won't talk to him except during Eagles games. Pat begins to realize that he was locked up for longer than he thought as he learns that the Eagles went to the Superbowl and that his younger brother, Jake is married and Pat missed all of it, has no memory of any of it.<br />Pat is invited to dinner by one of his old high school friend's and his wife and her sister, Tiffany. Tiffany is recently widowed and angry and a very interesting character. She starts following Pat when he goes on his daily marathon runs. Pat is annoyed as he is married and not interested. His mom tells him if he stops ignoring Tiffany, she might leave him alone. But she doesn't. Pat desperately wants to speak with Nicki but doesn't know where she is and has been told he is not allowed contact with her. Tiffany agrees to help him if she will be his dance partner in a local competition.<br /><br />This story is quirky and brilliant. I love how it is told through Pat's eyes and while the reader will pick up on things faster than Pat does, we still don't know and that makes the book even more compelling. You might guess parts but you won't guess it all. That is unless you see the movie first which tells the ending right at the beginning and Pat knows it. Such a waste to turn a great novel into such a bad story. Even if you have unfortunately seen the movie, I still recommend reading this, it's just amazing!faster than Pat does, we still don't know and that makes the book even more compelling.

B00000FC5H|5.0|If you want to go back in time and &#34;Remember&#34;  when you were in Jr high or just have fun This is the CD.  Earth, Wind and Fire always brings a smile to anyone that listens!  All the Great songs are on this one!
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I'm glad that we didn't pay for this, I would have been really pissed if we had seen it in the theaters!  It was like one of those dumb reality shows.  Don't waste your time!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|You have to love Stevie to love this CD.  It's good and the songs are definately the Nicks style. Great!
B005HSL626|4.0|It's fun. Not a whole lot to it, but it helps to pass the time. I need to add 5 more words, so here's more than 5.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My two year old grandson loves to play it it is something we can play together.  The color is beautiful and the sound is cool.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow - I couldn't put this book down once I started getting pulled into asking why were the protagonists dying at the start. A great book I'd recommend to anyone!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|A few parts were good but towards the middle the whining just killed it.  Even my teenagers thought it was too stupid to watch.  Could not finish.  I had to get drunk and very very bored to finish it.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Best Christmas album to date!  I loved this album, loved the voices... very authentic sounds, and I love the &#34;background&#34; music!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|20 minutes into it the first time I thought &#34;boy did I waste my money on this - it jumps around and is so hard to follow.  But I stuck it through because I liked the ideas behind it.  By the end of the movie I was sold but then decided to watch it a second time (fortunately for me, I watch on my Kindle during commuting so it was quite an easy watch a second time), and I loved it!!!  Made a lot more sense after watching it the first time.  If you give this movie a chance, it's such a great movie!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I've been a fan of Mad Mikkelsen for quite a while now and when I heard he was in this, I checked it immediately. I do not regret a thing. I watched every single episode in a single night without any breaks and I go back to rewatch it all the time. This is great, please watch it and you won't regret a thing.
B00B5LJ5NG|5.0|I'm so sorry for being so late rating this book.  It arrived very fast and in very nice condition.  I have not read the book yet, but am looking forward to it.
B004XE0TDW|5.0|I was eager to hear what Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) had up his sleeve after the quiet and haunting For Emma album.  This is a more electronic heavier album with the same classic Bon Iver tone. Below are the more noteworthy songs for me.<br />1. &#34;Perth&#34;  4:22-This is the perfect intro to the album. The guitar is melodic and catchy and introduces the listener to what the rest of the album will be about.<br /><br />3. &#34;Holocene&#34;  5:37-&#34;And at once I knew, I was not invincible&#34; this line sticks out.  It's heavy.<br /><br />5. &#34;Michicant&#34;  3:45-&#34;I'm biased to this song just because it has my homestate in the title.  Originally, I wasn't a huge fan of this song, but the wonderful cover by Kina Granis brought out the nuances of the song that I hadn't noticed before.  Overall a very good song<br /><br />8. &#34;Calgary&#34;  - This was the first single off the album, it's a strong more melodic song that is a good demonstration of the rest of the albums feel<br /><br />10. &#34;Beth/Rest&#34;  Justin ends the album taking a complete 180.  At first I hated this song. A lot.  It is a throwback to the 80's and I've just never been a fan of that style of music.  After listening to it several times however, it grew on me.  I began to hear other aspects of the song and appreciate what Vernon is doing with his voice.
0060191325|5.0|We need to understand each other...and going into a new relationship I found this book tre&#34;men&#34;dously helpful!  I definitely learned a lot, and recommend it highly!
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is the first book from this author that I read. I enjoyed and certainly would read more. However, he is very slow at times which made me jump some passages. Overall the story was captivating and very human.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|i really like this cover, it makes me feel safer when i take my kindle out. i just ordered another cover for my other kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Stayed up all night to finish it. Such a good book. Thank you Jesse for the recommendation.  Very thought provoking.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Sure I own high graphic games on my PC.  However, since the days of loading a game into DOS using a tape player.  What made it worth it?  It has always been about the game not the graphics.  If the initial learning curve is steep, that is a good sign of game depth.  The Help button on the first screen, will give you the basics.  The trese forum is very active.  You won't find big corp developers working hand in hand with customers.  These guys do listen, fix bugs and keep adding new content (Star Traders Elite), without charging you for an expansion pack.<br /><br />The Game looks really good on my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD, and one or two controls give you a short cut from a main game screen.  There are multiple difficulty settings so you can learn the basics on \\"Basic\\" difficulty seting.  In fact my first game on basic I ended in total failure, no money, stranded on a planet with no hope.  I quickly learned just how much information the game is providing you with during play, you may not understand all of it right away, but as more becomes clear, it gets you playing, \\"Just One More Turn then I gotta go to bed\\", at 2:00 in the morning.<br /><br />By the way if you are running on a Kindle or tablet, be sure to go into the Options screen and set \\"Aggressive Memory\\" to ON.  This gives your processor the ability to run the software at full tilt.  I would also recommend setting some of the \\"Toast\\" messages to long duration so you don't miss when they pop up during play.<br /><br />I usually ignore 5 star products when evaluating a purchase.  I figure the 4 or 3 star people ususally have more balanced reviews. Whenever I see the words like \\"Awesome! or Fantastic!\\"  I just stop reading the review.<br /><br />Ok all said and done;  I do rate this 5 Stars, and will purchase the other two games from the this developer.<br />At three bucks your car payment won't be late, what have you got to lose for a good time.<br /><br />Update July 14.  I have been playing this game since April20.  Still getting to bed late playing.  Don't let the<br /><br />games original release date fool you.  The game gets new content added almost every week sometimes more.  The game<br /><br />keeps growing in content.  The customer wish lists on the forum often result in these changes to content.  The<br /><br />Trese brothers also come up with their own creative designs.  Anyone visiting or joining the form will quickly be<br /><br />able to play the game on even the most difficult levels.  Joining the forum is secure, and has it's own benefits.<br /><br />Logon to [...]  to see what I'm talking about.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />My 5 star review still stands.
1856697061|5.0|I love the designs,  I am going to try them first on Large Barbie dolls (3ft. tall) then on adult size.<br /><br />Wonderful way to learn new and one of a kind designs.<br />Love to see the creativity in the book.<br /><br />Arrived on time and in great condition.  Juditz
0425252868|5.0|I cannot say enough about how good this book is.  I want to give credit to the author for presenting it so well.  Makos did an excellent job.  The dual threads about the pilots lives leading up to that incredible day was fascinating and the event itself, gripping.  Makos' skill an author is obvious, but he also had an amazing story to work with and that credit goes entirely to two main players, Franz Stiegler and Charlie Brown.  A person can never really know how they will react to extraordinary circumstances until they occur. I'm am sure both men replayed that day in their minds over and over again for the rest of their lives.  What a wonderful thing that they men were able to meet finally and share a rare kind of friendship that would last until their deaths.<br /><br />You do not need to be a history or war buff to enjoy this book, and frankly I think it is valuable reading if for no other reason but to get a perspective on World War II that you might never have considered.
B001KTATIS|5.0|I thought I was going to have to put English subtitles on, but that was not the case. Better than expected, its in English!!! Great product and great service, thank you.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|I really liked the story and the special effects. There was even an alternate ending on the DVD I enjoyed. I actually liked the alternate better than the real ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good this is the best solitary app you can buy on the planet for real. Why try anything else?
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward is one of the singer/songwriters of the Moody Blues. Great to hear him 'back' with a new offering of his uniquely styled songs. Wonderful voice and superb songs. A joy.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|As someone who had never heard of this movie or really had any idea what it would be about, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I won't go over the plot, as there are probably other reviews that do a much better and succinct summary, but I really came away with how they managed to turn acapella into such an interesting story.  The songs are modern, the transitions between them are seamless and very well done, and best of all, they are catchy!  I found myself singing or humming the various performances they did and even re-watched a few of the scenes on Youtube the next few days.  It is - THAT - good.<br /><br />The performances from the individual actors themselves were also top notch, with a special shout out to Rebel Wilson.  I'm not sure if her lines were scripted or if she just improvised a few of the parts, but a kudos to her for making an already enjoyable movie that much more!<br /><br />In short, I could not recommend this movie enough!  It's funny, smart, and so damn catchy.  A must watch for everyone and definitely an addition to my blu-ray collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love  this game buy it it will never get old trust me and the BEST part is its FREE!
B005YPJ62E|5.0|I have probably given out three dozen copies of this - it's the perfect gift for anyone and I believe everyone should be required to listen to it!
B009NY43NY|4.0|As usual a wonderful read. All the people we love and hate. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5,  is because it was a very short story at  full price.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another great movie in the Lord of the Rings adventure. This movie prequels The Lord of the Rings Trilogy & it shows how Bilbo Baggins gets involved in the adventure. It is another good movie whick I highly recommend. If you haven't seen the Lord of the rings movies then start with this one. I think once you see this one, you'll be hooked & want to see the rest.<br />I give five stars because it's totally worth it. I can't wait for the next one!! Happy watching & Enjoy!!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I downloaded Angry Bird Friends,on my tablet. It works great.<br /><br />It was free from Amazon.<br /><br />MY grandson sent me a request to play the game. It was very easy to download.<br /> I will download it now on my desk top.<br /><br />Thank you, I am an 81 year old person.
0316019984|5.0|We gave this book to our grandson for his birthday. He was blown away and loved it. He is a great fan of the super heroes.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Another one from the past I enjoyed tremendously watching again. Daryl Hannah is adorable as the Mermaid and Tom Hanks and John Candy wonderful in their early roles. Also, 5 stars for Ron Howard as a first time director. This movie is just a lot of fun and laughs. If you love comedy and never seen it - get it. If you remember it from the past - watch it again. Either way, you won't regret it, especially at the price that Amazon offers it. Have fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is awsome, and i dont really get know what the difference between it and minecraft honestly, except this one is cheaper GET IT NOW!!!
0316019984|5.0|The book arrived on time, and in new condition. It was just as described.  Amazing pop-ups, really well done.  I bought it for a Great-grandson who has quite a collection of Pop-up books that I have given him over the years, and he still seems to enjoy adding another one or two to his collection.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Good movies seem so few & far between anymore. So I am thrilled that &#34;Red&#34; has delivered on so many levels:<br /><br />It's a great action flick<br />The cast is perfect<br />The storyline is actually cohesive<br />It is absolutely hilarious<br />And it has Helen Mirren in it - it's perfect!<br /><br />I've nearly worn out my copy since it is now my go=to movie when there isn't anything good on tv. Which means I'm watching it most nights.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|A bargain and a reminder that great singing and Wagner ARE possible. The conductors don't let down either. Now where's the Verdi at the Met to complement this fine release?
B000002GOZ|5.0|Before MTV gave up the ghost on Music completely they did come up with a few programs that were truly inspired. MTV's Unplugged being one of them. This show encouraged musicians to really showcase their talents by stripping down to the basics. Just them and instruments, no mixing, no enhancers just their vocals. It was a personal challenge really as it was truly exposing themselves to the public. Interestingly for every musician that arose to the challenge there was three or four that ran and hid. For those that took the chance there were the expected mixed results. However a few came thru not only unscathed but the diversity and truth of their talent was enhanced and even brought up a notch.<br /><br />Bryan Adams is one of those that came thru with flying colors as his vocals are true to form and he even shows his creativity in instrumentation by re-imaging several pieces here most noteably melding \\"If ya wanna be bad - ya gotta be good\\" with \\"Let's make a night to remember\\" turning a ballad into a rousing rocker and the now well played \\"I'm Ready\\". Originally a hard rocker from his second album he has added an orchestra and slowed the tempo creating a truly ethereal piece. Adams really shows his range and caliber here.<br /><br />For me this album aptly illustrates why a musician like Bryan Adams will always be relevant.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Love this series. George Martin is an engrossing story writer, who not only presents a detailed picture of his world but takes us into the minds of a diverse range of characters with his masterful handling of the technique of switching view points. The story should stall and founder, but it never does, sweeping along with astounding pace and grandeur.  Being of a tender hearted nature, I baulk at the level of violence and sheer nastyness of some events, but never enough to stop me reading.<br />My only gripe is, that having read the whole series to date, end to end, I now have to wait with the rest of Martin's readership, for the next book.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I enjoyed Book One. Although it took me quite awhile to get the names, kingdoms, and families straight, once I was clear, the story became much more interesting. I am hooked.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I am nearing the end of this book and loving the direction in which the story line is heading. Wonderfully descriptive book. I am recommending it to all my friends.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|The detail of the war strategy was interesting, but I was disappointed in the omission of characters from Book One. Adding many new characters and story lines created a disconnect between Book One and Book Two for me.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone. This movie shows the life of a neo-Nazi and the consequences of believing a big lie. I'm surprised that Edward Norton didn't receive an Oscar for this. The movie was entertaining and the acting couldn't get better. This movie has a lot of racial slurs and explicit language but it's essential to the story build up and the development of the characters. This movie will make you think, \\"Do people really believe in this white supremacy BS?\\" Also, this movie shows the effect of little brother following big brother even if it's this white supremacy BS. It will truly show the effect that big brothers and fathers have on the younger siblings: that they will follow and believe in what they believe no matter what. I will just say one thing, the ending is unexpected, you won't see it coming.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|This is probably one of the best (if not THE best), book I've ever read on how to appreciate the truly important things in life, all of which are simple and all of which are abundant. We have completely derailed from the values of life and this book brings us back to the fundamentals of a successful living. But \\"success\\" as it should be know, not as we define it today. A truly moving story, wrote with simplicity and maturity. Makes you rearrange your priorities and look at life, the way is was meant to be. I hope we can put it in practice.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Never gets boring and great for keeping yourself occupied for short periods of time.  Great graphics as well.  Worth downloading for sure.
B0082S3FA4|4.0|The fact that EVERY number and some words were turned into nothing but symbols!!!!! Now I still was able to read and enjoy it, but it perturbed me to not know what the numbers were. Many times it was talking about money. The amount of words this happened on was very minimal and barely noticeable. So don't worry about getting nothing but symbols, words being turned into symbols didn't even happen in every story.<br /><br />Now, the stories themselves were amazing! I know I'm late to the party, but I've never read Sherlock Holmes. I knew plenty about it, but just never picked up any of the books. Well a blogger I follow linked me to this version, which was FREE! So I thought \\"What the heck?\\" and downloaded it. I'm always reading so I can never get my hands on enough books. And being a broke college kid the \\"free\\" price tag very much appealed to me. Once I started reading I found I really loved these tales! And I learned a few new words as well (thank you Kindle for having a free dictionary that will tell me any word without having to leave the book). Many of the words added to my vocabulary are very much from the time period and not used much today in conversation. But it never hurts to expand your mind. However, don't worry about the stories being hard to read. The new words weren't many, and the stories flowed on without effort on the readers part. All in all it was wonderful!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is worthless I will stick to otter box 70 dollars on case and can't use it because cant text the plastic is so loose that it don't let you hit space junk in my opinion.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I really enjoyed it - well written interesting kept me wanting to read until the end  the end had a twist
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The heroes of Olympus is a wonderful book full of adventure, drama, suspension, and amazing adventure. The heroes of Olympus series are amazing.

B0031RS4UM|3.0|Not such an interesting read as the other Jack Reacher books, It is a ok read, the main thing thing that bothers me about Jack Reacher is that he doesn't change his underwear for about 3 days!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the characters and the intense grappling with emotions. Worthwhile time spent on a very unique topic.  Unconditional love renewed.
B007L24T52|5.0|David Baldacci at his best.  A real page tapper which I didn't want to put down until the last page. Read it before reading &#34;The Hit&#34;. It will appeal to readers of both sexes that like stories with a lot of action.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was disappointed with the quality of the writing in this book.  Every character Sookie ever encountered appears in this book, but there is no depth to any of them - even the other main characters. It relied very heavily on the storyline of the previous book, Deadlocked. I had to reread Deadlocked before continuing with Dead Ever After because I was so confused.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book all of it yeah it took me some time to read it but I have kids that task  my time, I would tell everyone I talk to about the book an  how good it and a lot of my friends said they would read it
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Great book. Enjoyed it. The characters came together nicely. I always in enjoy Ken Follett's style of writing. Looking forward the third book
B00COMLLX2|4.0|So first, before anything else, I'd like to note that I'm a huge fan of Zen Pinball on PS3, and its subsequent release on PS VITA in the form of Zen Pinball 2. As such, I'm mildly disappointed by the fact that the older legacy tables aren't available for purchase, as the tables available to buy piece meal are all from either latter day DLC or are from the Marvel comics licensing partnership. I mean, if you're a fan of anything Marvel or Star Wars pinball related, this is definitely the game for you, but if you happen to be a fan of, say, that awesome Ninja Gaiden Sigma or the Street Fighter II table, you're out of luck.<br /><br />All that said, I'm pretty disappointed with the performance issues I've seen while playing the one free table that comes with the download. At times it runs great, while at others it chugs and gets hiccups of choppiness. I would like to note that I was downloading another game (and noticed it installed too) and an HD movie in the background, so who knows if that affected it or not.<br /><br />Even though I adore being able to play pinball on a beautiful vertical screen, I think I'm going to have to keep my Zen Pinball purchases strictly to PS3 and VITA. That framerate inconsistency is not assuring. mean, I'm under no delusions of the Kindle Fire HD's performance speeds in general, but for a game like Zen Pinball, it's kind of a killer.<br /><br />I'm rating it 4/5 only because I know these are quality tables and a fun game, but honestly if I were to rate it on my brief impression of the port, I'd give it something less. Try the free table in the download yourself and see whether or not my issues appear for you.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is a master of character and narrative. And he puts that all together in one of the most compelling reads. I can't believe I have to wait for more...
B003FXCSNQ|3.0|I read the reviews before I purchased it. I'm a fan of the movie, so I was prepared for the 'disappointments' other reviewers spoke about. I WAS disappointed, but more by the clunky and somewhat amateurish writing style. I detected none of the subtle explorations of human nature or character development, except in the most superficial way, that has been hinted at in other reviews. As a 'philosophical novel', it fails miserably (IMHO). It may be that I am an Android, because I certainly felt no empathy with any of the characters in this story. I'm not sure why this is classed as a 'SF Masterwork' . . . perhaps I should read some other titles by the same author to see if I've missed something that warrants Dick's iconic status in this genre.
0451197968|5.0|Although I must have read \\"The Running Man\\" back in the 1980s I will say I enjoyed it better the second time thirty years later; the book has aged better than me! ;)  Unlike so many Stephen King novels this book is short, frighteningly believable, and clever/insightful as opposed to be a bit bizarre.  The story about a futuristic reality television star (/ victim) literally running for his life feels much in tune to the reality TV craze nowadays.  The main character is entirely believable and the plot moves along at a rapid clip.  And the ending ... OMG!!  Simply superb.<br /><br />Bottom line: a true classic that FAR eclipses the (decent but different) film adaptation.  Strongly recommended.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|I have read this book over 2-3 weeks now. For a book to grab me to the point of not putting it down, it has to grab me from the start and unfortunately this book just does not deliver that. I would read a chapter or two, then not touch it for a few days as we follow the character through the pages of her journal that she has been writing for two weeks. The book is repetitive, but without giving too much away, that is the point! She is recapping her previous life everyday as when she goes to sleep at night, her memories she has learned have been erased. She can only learn her predicament by re-reading the journal that she adds to daily, trying to piece together her life. As it is repetitive, it became boring for me. However, I stuck it out and I can only say the last 40% of this book was gripping enough to keep me reading night after night; the last 10-20% had me not putting it down at all. A wonderful, well written twist to the tale, but a disappointing ending for me. The book seemed to just 'stop dead' and kind of left you hankering for a little bit more to see if it had a happy ending.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. It is very fun and I am very siproeed that it could even have 1 or 2 stars.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|My daughter spent the last of her birthday money to buy this.  She was excited to get it and it did not disappoint her.  I was surprised at how much extra stuff came with it for the money.  Very durable and lots of fun.  She keeps the set in a separate plastic container in order to not lose all of the extra little things that come with the set.
0780626494|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Christopher Walken as the scientist created a bomb shelter to protect his family (Sissy Spacek and Brendan Fraser) for 35 years in case the big one happened.  When they were finally able to &#34;resurface&#34;<br />they were in for a shock by all the changes.

0451205766|4.0|If you have seen \\"The Godfather\\" the movie, then you have, essentially, read the book.  Characters, scenes, dialogue- it's all here, taken from the pages of Mario Puzo's Mafia defining novel and expertly put on film.  Because the movie is such a classic and iconic piece of cinema, it is hard to ignore its presence when reading the book; and when all is said and done, \\"The Godfather\\" the movie casts too great a shadow and leaves \\"The Godfather\\" the book as a lesser creation.<br />  That does not mean that this is not an incredible read.  Mario Puzo has created a classic.  Don Corleone and Michael Corleone are fictional beasts, such phenomenal creations that one cannot consider the real Mafia without instilling a little bit of each of them into the picture.  The first half of the book is near perfect, unraveling at a breakneck pace as the picture of Don Corleone and his web of power is masterfully described.<br />  Where Puzo stumbles, however, is when he starts to fill in the back story and wastes too many pages adding details that do not needed to be added.  Back stories of ultimately minor characters- Johnny Fontane the singer, Carlo the abusive husband, Jules Segal the doctor, and more- slow the momentum to a near halt and take the reader away from the action, which is the Corleones.  Puzo's strength is not his descriptive writing, and when he spends pages talking about plastic surgery or life in Hollywood, he does not possess the magic he shows off when writing about gangsters.  Puzo knows how to write about gangsters; when he strays into other fields, he sounds lost and a little naive.<br />  Yet even with the unnecessary literary detours, \\"The Godfather\\" is a must read.  If you have seen the movie, it is thrilling to revisit the genre defining action; and if you have not seen the movie, then you need to read the book now and understand what all the deserved hype is about.  Edit out fifty pages and it becomes a Five Star book; as is, it is still an undeniable classic.assic.
193700788X|4.0|I think all of us Sookie fans have been waiting to find out how everything ends of in the land of Bon Temps. Well, in a way, Harris does wrap things up for the readers, but not quite in the way I think we were all expecting. I guess we'll all have to wait for the follow up.

This was a wonderfully written story of the sacrifices of a mother and the mistakes that we make while trying to love our children. From beginning to end, I enjoyed the read! Excellent read!!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW, Its been a few days since I read this now. Still I don't know even how to write a review that would do this book Hopeless justice. Amazing, for the the emotional ride it will take you on causing year hear to stop and break many times. Beautiful,for the relationship of Sky and Holder he really is quite the man I would say and any man that would be there for a girl and stay right by her side through horrible things and be SO patient is worth it. Sad but Strength filled, due to the things Sky has to been through and the things she has to learn that are both good and bad. Love I loved that their was lovemaking not just sex and what sweetness it was. I am excited to see the cover for the next book. HOT and ADORABLE. I loved Holder and his directness. I think what he has to say will be interesting and funny. I also look forward to the Slammed series which I haven't read yet but hear good things about.
B0058YPLA2|4.0|I was, admittedly, dubious at first. But the show is utterly amazing, at least to me, and I really enjoyed it. I only bought the first season because I can vouch for it's awesome. The character development is pretty clever and there isn't a single character I actually hate. I have a B.A. in English so I can be a real stickler about character development, writing, and consistency. But, all in all, I've gotta say they were really on the ball with this one----at least for first season. I haven't seen second yet!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I don't know what to say. This is a great interpretation of the Sherlock Holmes story. I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries, thrillers, dramas or .. well, stories?  The actors are very riveting, Benedict does a fantastic job, and martin is well, just fantastic as well. The story lines are not as obvious as you would think and each episode has you guessing as to the finish.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Loved this. Best album I've purchased in a long time. I was so surprised with how much I enjoy this album.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I read somewhere once that, at the very best, a reader can be devastated that a novel has ended. This is that kind of novel.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|great game for kids of all ages a lot better than the first one I hope septic lab does more cut the ropes
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I didn't think I would get pulled into this show, but one time watching a rerun and I am hooked. It is a great update to the original and it adds in fresh new flair that keeps you wanting to watch it again and again. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action, adventure and a little mystery.
193700788X|5.0|This is not a \\"Oh noes, I think I own this series and Sookie didn't end up with who she was supposed to!\\" review. Those seem to be the majority floating around, and they're kind of ridiculous.<br /><br />I think that, overall, this is a very well-written book, with lots of nuance, action, and an ending that doesn't make everyone happy. Which is exactly how books should be. I also believe this one was an improvement on the last couple, with more detail and a more consistent plot.<br /><br />Ms. Harris is an exceptional writer, and, in Sookie, she created a strong character. If people didn't like the ending, they can write some fanfic. Ms. Harris, who is a lovely person, ended the series the way she wanted to, because they're her books. And this one was a delight to read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have come to just love these characters and I can't wait to read the third book in this series--I already know I will be very sorry to read that last page!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The Frys' were just everyday people with everyday problems and the unknown tragedy of losing touch with their only child.  Ignorance of mental health and its control over all the people who love the afflicted person and tried to rationalize the behavior in order to accept the flaw in a run-of-the-mill daily life setting, was the most upsetting.  The novel also showed the extreme to almost nonexistent symptoms and how they &#34;work on the minds&#34; of everyone involved.  We need earlier understanding, treatment and renewed hope to continue pecking away at the illness to find a cure.  Thank you.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I have always loved the Sherlock Holmes' stories and having a movie of a Sherlock Holmes' story with Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. starring is simply amazing!  I loved this movie and its sequel.  There aren't an enormous number of movies that I will watch over and over again but this, and the sequel, are definitely in that number.

B00BCV3HGU|2.0|Will.i.am has been responsible for some quality work in music and his last album \\"Songs About Girls\\" was probably equally successful along the likes of Black Eyed Peas material.  However, \\"Songs About Girls\\" was a release from 2007 and Will.i.am has been a little busy since then. Two Black Eyed Peas albums have been released, plus numerous guest projects he's been working on.<br />It's legit to question why his newest solo album \\"Will Power\\" lacks just that. His effort to bring glam cameos to the roster of the tracks is definitely there- with Brit Spears standing out amongst the others.  But that could be the only stand-out effort here.<br />The album starts out soft and promising, as if an intro into a large circus.  But the following songs are soft as well... and no promise of hope. Too many tracks with lost identity will hurt any album. We find the sound of Black Eyed Peas hard to find. Even \\"Songs About Girls\\" was somewhat different from Black Eyed Peas sound- slightly. But his first solo attempt was good as the album was surrounded with good vibes, catchy choruses and solid production. The only song that didn't fit was \\"The Donque Song\\".... And that particular song is what \\"Willpower\\" is. Nothing but songs that sound like the questionable \\"Donque Song.\\"<br />Besides every song trying to have a David Guetta blessing, this album may have lost focus simply because its been some time since his last \\"Songs About Girls.\\" It may be a long time before Mr. Am tries again. But perhaps that's what hurts. Too much time. Only a better, quicker follow up will impact the Pea that has gone sour.

B0036T31YY|4.0|Compared to a lot of recent horror / thriller movies I've seen lately, I was pleasantly surprised. Also, the amazing acting ability of Melissa George definitely adds to the entertainment of the movie.  Prepare for an emotional roller coaster ride.  It kind of reminded me of \\"Memento\\".  Definitely worth the $3.99 I paid to watch this movie.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a bit of a challenge to make the right moves, which is good for the brain.  It's good to take up time when you don't want to expand a lot of energy on something more complicated.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|The beginning definitely captures the audience and helps to set the stage for the rest of the movie.  I would agree with several other critics, that the CGI is over done, and takes away from the scariness of the movie.  However, the children are very creepy and makes up for the poor use of CGI.  I would recommend watching this movie on DVD or Amazon Instant Video.  I would not want to spend $10.00 to watch it in a movie theater though.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|Easy to clean.  Protects, and holds the Kindle in a good position without tiring your hands.  I wish it held the Kindle in a vertical position differently, but I can't give a suggestion as how to accomplish that.  Cost is ridicules.  If I had the time I'd have made my own!!!
1451695195|5.0|This was very interesting. I liked the scientific approach ...but got bogged down in some of the more technical chapters. It shows that miracles are still very much a part of our world. If this nearly atheistic doctor can make it to heaven .... There is hope for all of us. This book drives home that God is love and prayers have real power. Thank you.

And the part in my subject line, about \\"conclusions tbd\\", that is a compliment too. He comes out with some conclusive summation, but leaves much of it open to the reader and to future research.<br /><br />(I purchased this book, in is Kindle edition, as part of a 3-part bundle available on Amazon during Ariely's Coursera class in 2013.)

193700788X|5.0|***SPOILER-ish WARNING***<br /><br />Dead Ever After was a fitting ending to a series of books written about Sookie Stackhouse.  The emphasis, of course is that these books were about Sookie. They were not about vampires (although there were plenty in this series) and they weren't about which lover was best for Sookie (and she had a plethora of lovers to choose from).  This was about Sookie's journey and the story that Charlaine Harris chose to write for her.<br /><br />I'm puzzled by all of the negative reviews of this book because I thought it was a brilliant ending to the series. Charlaine masterfully took each thread (some of which had been open ended for years) and tied them all into neat little bows. She addressed Sookie's Fae heritage.  She addressed Sam and Sookie's long standing friendship (but always, since book 1 there has been something more there - if you were reading and paying attention this was not a surprise!). She created a healing between she and her best friend, Tara. She got rid of toxic Arlene (praise the Lord and pass the bourbon, that B is dead!). She brought Quinn back and allowed us to see that he really was a nice guy who wanted what was best for Sookie. And she established quite clearly that while Sookie and Eric loved each other, they truly wanted very different things in life.  They tried to make things work and it was an impossible relationship.<br /><br />Sookie wanted Eric to be what he could not be.  Eric wanted Sookie to be what she could not be.<br /><br />Sookie wanted a \\"happily ever after\\" (doesn't every girl?) that involved remaining human (ish).  She wanted babies. She wanted to hear grandkids running in her home.  Her core values cried out for that.<br /><br />Eric wanted his vampire bride. He wanted a warrior by his side. And he wanted Sookie to be his mistress (after dissolving their vampire marriage and previously scoffing at Sookie's human version of marriage) and eventually turn her.  Both options were repellant to Sookie.  Eric loved Sookie, but he didn't respect Sookie's wishes.  Pam and Karin confirmed he'd planned to turn her - which I believe was the \\"nail in the coffin\\" - pun intended - for Sookie.  I realize that there were many out there who viewed Eric as the ultimate guy, but Eric's view of their things was NOT what Sookie wanted for her \\"happily ever after\\".  And while readers may not AGREE with Sookie's desires, Charlaine Harris wrote this book and stayed true to all the characters.  Many readers put themselves in the main characters shoes and many would have chosen to be with Eric. However Charlaine wrote Sookie with a strong voice, a strong sense of self, and a beautiful perspective on life.  This was Sookie's choice, dear reader. Not yours.<br /><br />I laughed at the banter between the characters. I cried when Sookie had her heart broken by Eric in Fangtasia. I ached for her when she realized what many readers had realized - this wasn't meant to be.  I was overjoyed when Sam had his epiphany and decided that he was going to create his own \\"happily ever after\\".  Sookie chose a life in Bon Temps. Sookie chose herself.<br /><br />This was the Sookie Stackhouse Series, and it was a lovely adventure.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I love these books but was so disappointed at the end.  I felt completely unsatisfied and it just didn't ring true to me.  I'm just going to pretend there's another book coming after this one to fix all the problems!

B0055MBQOM|3.0|I wish I would have invested the funds into something a little better. The ColorMunki took quite a bit of playing with to get the results I was hoping for. Initially the calibration was always brown. I ended up using the advanced mode, tweaking the options, to finally get descent results. I have 2 Dell 24&#34; monitors, one IPS and one non IPS. Sending images to various printers I finally found a pro printer that works. It took a few months prior to me getting what I was looking for with this device.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|It had a good storyline but I had to read it in my reading class and there were so many complicated words. Sometimes you couldn't understand what he was saying because he used different words.
0812993845|2.0|I pre-ordered this book way in advance hoping for the usual Sophie Kinsella, lovable, vulnerable, charming women.  It wasn't.  I didn't care for Lottie.  I liked the sister, Fliss more!  Each chapter changes from Lottie to Fliss.  The entire book was based on Fliss stopping Lottie's wedding night from happening.  Lottie never developed any depth.  The book just dragged on.  There was nothing funny in this book.  It was flat and boring.
0226264211|2.0|Very interesting.<br />But I wasn't able to agree all his theories.<br />For example, he refers to a sewer system, he asserts unless you like a current sewer system offered by municipal government, he recommends that you should move anywhere else, such as other counties, states.<br />This argument is a little bit extreme, too American for me.<br />The published date of this book is 1962. This doesn't seem to be universal for Japanese such as me.<br />Some regulation must be needed today especially in Japan.<br />But I think this is a very good book for those people who opposes to TPP.<br />Business persons all over the world should read this book!

B00B2166BS|3.0|One of the claims that was made for this cable was that it would re-charge the Nexus 10 faster than the Micro USB cable.  In some subjective tests, it does not seem to re-charge the N10 any faster than the standard cable (which typically costs A LOT less than this cable).
B001TH16DI|5.0|A great collection for Trekkies, almost-Trekkies, wanabe-Trekkies, or just sci-fi fans. Vivid picture and great sound. As close to big screen experience as you can get on the small screen.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was a great read, I enjoyed it soo much.  The storyline was so interesting and I loved how Ms. Harris brought in all the characters from the series to rally around Sookie in her time of need.  Sookie got what she wanted at the end, what she said she always wanted throughout the whole series if I read her correctly all these years. I don't want to spoil anything, but for me, when i closed the book, i gave a great big happy sigh knowing that all was going to be well in Bon Temps and all will be okay for Sookie, finally!
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Won't win picture of the year, but definitely entertaining and fun to watch. I will watch it again at some point.
0786956291|3.0|I had fond memories of playing D&D with a friend back in the 80s so when my girlfriend and I got on this recent board game kick I decided to look at it again almost 30 years later. This set is great for getting started but the only problem I have with it is that it doesn't give you quick step by step character creation instructions. Instead it takes you on a short mini-adventure and instructs you to fill in your character traits as you go, but it feels very arbitrary and doesn't explain where these numbers are coming from. For example, on my first run through I chose a Rogue and the instructions would say things like \\"put the numbers 14, 12, 11, and 10\\" as your traits in whatever you want your character to have (Charisma, Wisdom, etc.) While this is fine for a run-through, I don't know where these numbers came from, so I'm left just as knowledge-less as before as to how to create a new character. And I definitely can't show anyone else how to; I'd have to hand them the Player book and have them go through the adventure themselves. The adventure approach would have been fine, IF they also had a Quick Character Creation section (just a c ouple of pages) to show me how to do it...I shouldn't have to go through the mini-adventure every time I want to make a new character. I also bought the Pathfinder Beginner Box and they do a great job of this (too early to compare the rest of the two packs, but Pathfinder got a lot of points here). I searched the web to discover there are a couple of ways to create new characters, but since the whole point of this was to get a noob like me up and running, I think this was an important thing to skip and wish Wizards of the Coast didn't omit such a huge aspect in this box. Other than that, it does include a good amount of tokens and the mat, and the DM book seems pretty good for the early stages at least.
B002TVQ4H6|5.0|Great movie if you like a great story with lots of suspense ! The small cast did a great acting job as well !!
B000RPCK1U|3.0|The pace of this movie is slower than it's superior predecessor Goldeneye, the action scenes are less realistic and many scenes make it easy to tell you are watching a film set rather than make it look like the real thing. Pierce Brosnan has also aged tremendously since his last role.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I not only enjoyed the simple telling of this story, I enjoyed the message it delivered. Many question the existence of God and question which religion is \\"right\\". Dr. Alexander's experience is quite enlightening. It is well worth the time to read his message. May God bless and keep you all.
B00C7GZ19U|5.0|This delightful CD is as beautiful, charming and seductive as the lady herself.  Treat yourself to this irresistible confection and imagine that you have taken a trip to Paris.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This movie just plain sucked. The story sucked. The plot was terrible. It wasn't scary at all. Made me almost jump once. ALMOST. This movie is a definite skip. waste of money.

B007ME5BUG|5.0|Anthony Beevor is a marvelous war historian, who puts together  a fascinating overview of the various theaters of war at the different stages  in the war and of the widely differing leadership styles in the conduct of the war.  The author has provided a most interesting<br />account of the  political background to most of the strategically  important decisions taken during the war by the various leaders and has also highlighted  the strengths and weaknesses of many of the generals involved and in all theaters.  What makes this book such a tour de force is the author's  ability to describe in detail the experiences of the front line soldiers and the horrors of war, no matter where.

1402775458|4.0|My 10 yr old daughter's review: This is a good book, but the fault in it is that there is a lot of violence. The good part is that is suspenseful, and you want to keep reading. Long John Silver, Captain Smollett, Dr.Livesey, and Squire Trelawney, and of course, the main character Jim Hawkins, make this book very interesting. So, I would give this book five stars if there wasn't so much violence.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|This album is fantastic. Amazing harmonies, fun, energetic, uplifting, high spirited music by amazingly talented people. I can listen to the entire album on my commute to work and do so every day. Guaranteed to keep your spirits high and your dancing shoes on.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|An absolutely fabulous read!! I learned so much from this book. I dislike the ending, only because it meant the death of possibly the greatest president in our country's history, but the beautiful writing made up for this
B003I55BIA|5.0|Awww modern romance at its best... l think besides the romance and connection of the characters, you can learn from it too
0425269205|3.0|I actually didn't have high expectations for this final installment because the last book pretty much hinted (okay, clobbered us over the head) with where Sookie would end up: all the baby talk, her regret over how violent her life has become, the cluviel dor, etc.  Therefore, I found this final adventure to be very predictable and subsequently, boring.<br /><br />The mystery of Arlene's death felt like a retread of previous books - it isn't the first time, or even the third time, Sookie became implicated in the death of someone.  Here, the death just became an excuse for everyone of any importance to pass back through and be wrapped up in a neat little bow.  Every thread was tied off so perfectly that it felt completely contrived.  I love a happy ending, I really do. And I wanted Sookie to have hers.  But, I want that ending to be EARNED and I didn't feel as though Harris gave us that.  Sookie comes full circle, with every problem and potential danger in her life resolved as though the supernatural events had never occurred. Without much action on her part to get there.<br /><br />This book wasn't bad, which is why I gave it three stars.  There is a plot, readers revisit familiar faces and Sookie gets her happily ever after.  But, it was anything but climactic. I wanted a resounding conclusion; I wanted a feeling of satisfaction.  Instead, this wasn't a \\"finale\\", it was just an ending. I think Harris became tired of Sookie several books ago and her publisher kept pushing for more. I can't help but wonder if she had been able to alternate among her series as she used to, that maybe she would have had the pizzazz to let Sookie go out in a blaze of glory. Overall, if you've come this far you'll want to read the conclusion - just don't expect anything spectacular.  Though I'm disappointed, I'm also excited that Harris can perhaps return to her other series. I liked Lily Bard more than Sookie anyway.<br /><br />A NOTE ABOUT THE SIGNED LIMITED EDITION: the signed edition is absolutely beautiful!  The book is bound in dark purple linen, with a matching slipcase.  Both the book and case are hot foil stamped, in color.  No dust jacket, as issued. The end papers are full color illustrations from Lisa Desimini, who has done all the book covers.  The book is limited to 2500 copies, but I was also excited to see that it was individually numbered (e.g. xx/2500). The retail price is a bit high, but on par with small press limited editions.  Definitely worth the investment, though I wish the story had been as good.is absolutely beautiful!  The book is bound in dark purple linen, with a matching slipcase.

B008220DGE|4.0|Not surprisingly given the quality of Anderson's work as a writer and director 'The Master' is superior film making from a 'master' craftsman. As a top drawer film-maker in the grand tradition of global film narrative, he has the ability to engage a viewer's attention and emotions at a fundamental human level. Casts and crews invariably  provide quality of the highest order in ensuring veracity (truth) within all important strands of the story-telling, and 'The Master' is no exception. Standouts are the performances of the three leads - Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams - the photography, editing and music.
B00C2VGAW2|2.0|i expected a lot from this STAR-STUBBED album and when the lead single released i thought the album is going to be a masterpiece. but this album is awful.<br />the only good songs in this album are from Lana Del Rey, Florence + the Machine, Sia, Gotye and The xx. and the cover of Back to Black; it was super super awful. Beyonce and Andre 3000 just ruined that awesome song!!!
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Best features and customization but both the home screen and widget could use a more modern redesign. The iPhone-esque timer needs to go and how about swipe gestures between tabs.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I liked Matthew McFadden very much as Mr. Darcy.  Though stiff and aloof, he seemed to almost quake with sublimated passion.  It made me think of the many times in personal relationships that you try to convey your feelings--only to end up completely misunderstood!  I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth Bennett's good-natured but concerned father.<br /><br />My favorite scene was the last--where Mr. Bennett speaks with Elizabeth in his study as he tries to understand how her feelings for Mr. Darcy were able to change so dramatically.  I was very moved but their interaction in this scene--and the joy that came with the understanding of how truly she now loved Mr. Darcy!

B00338QENI|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a wide variety of women of all ages and interests.  Why O why?  The survival of the cells is an accident of biology, and obviously the quality of the cells does not equate to the quality of the life of the donor.  I was appalled by the abuses in other experiments (some of which used HeLa cells), but I couldn't get exercised about the activities of the doctors and researchers who encountered Henrietta and cultured her cells.  Certainly her daughter who died in the institution had a sad life, but it was the sins of the parents that doomed her initially.  Syphilis kills and maims, and ironically, the HPV seems to be what made HeLa indestructible.  The patient had many chances to be treated for the venereal diseases that were repeatedly diagnosed but she failed to appear for follow-up care.  The ignorance and immorality of the family was both offensive and disturbing, although their stories did give me some insight into why so many of the kids in my school district (in California) are illiterate criminals despite the efforts of their teachers to offer education and opportunity. I didn't want to spend my reading time with the writer or with her sources.

B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I dont often write reviews, but because I am a fan of the series and all the reviews I read were so negative, I thought I would put a positive one out there. I bought this book when It was first released and there were only a few very harsh reviews with small rating.<br />I rated this book a 5, I still couldn't put it down.<br />I think the negative reviews are looking at each book individually and not the whole series.<br />I am a HUGE Eric fan! But he is so selfish and Sookie is good to be out of his life!<br />Yes there were bits of mundane in there, but there needed to be. We had to see how Sookies life had changed when Eric dumped her and how lonely she was. All Sookie wants is to be happy and safe and we can see that in these so called mundane grooming pieces of the book.<br />I really enjoyed the book, I can see why Sookie made the choices that she did. My questions have been answered and I have hopes that Sookie will be happy with Sam.<br />They were always meant to be together, right from book 1!!!<br />Its a perfect final novel to this fabulous series and I am really going to miss Sookie Stackhouse!

This book came in perfectly new condition, very timely, at a very reasonable price.  I haven't read it yet but expect that my ancestor Lord Kilmarnock will probably be in this book as he was beheaded in the Tower of London for treason at the Battle of Culloden in August 18,1746.  Prince Charles appointed him as one of his generals.  I was thrilled to find him in the second book, Dragonfly in Amber.

B000UZ4EVG|4.0|Felix Mendelssohn has long been one of my favorite composers and the very first symphony I really liked was his Italian Symphony.  Until recently, I did not know he wrote string quartets.  Since I also like sting quartets, I bought this set to listen.  I really enjoyed the listening and will listen often.  These cover a wide range of time and style, but I like them all.  I rate 4 of 5 stars, since even though I have no issues at all, there is nothing that stands out and captures me in the moment.  They are just simply fine performances.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Though this movie was a gift, we have watched it about 2-3 times and tossed it aside. not a movie that you really want to watch over and over. I recommend rental.

B001OSIV62|1.0|This is a well made movie about a donkey's posterior. Basically this guy does something amazing then forgets about all the people who helped him get there. I'd like to thank the director for making a movie that glorifies selfishness and poor moral judgement. Maybe he could direct a documentary chronicling Gaius Julius Caesar next. Do yourselves a favor and miss this film.

(lol) But on the real...great story, great characters, great meaning - it's got everything great!!
B0083SBJXS|3.0|Loved the movie, but was totally disappointed in the 'special' features. Two short docs? That's it?  IM and IM2 had docs on each aspect of the production. On a movie this big I expect nothing short of a full set, especially after grossing over a billion. Sad.<br /><br />Probably due to Disney. They LOVE short-changing the customer, like Tron. Cheapskates
B003V2HWP0|5.0|Beautiful movie, exquiste expressions and emotional richness. It has depth and a love that breaks through conditioning of society and norm.There is a rawness and realness that is refreshing. Enjoyed it.
1451629192|1.0|Flame me if you must. Just know that I'm rating the book, not her strength and her heart that got her through this 18 year hell. The events of those years are disturbing and just extremely unfortunate. I really admire her perseverance. I am happy to know she's back home, doing well, and (all things considered) is able to return and lead a more or less normal life. I want to be very clear about all of that.<br /><br />However, I am rating the quality of the book and her writing rather than her heart. As much as I'd like to be able to, I can't recommend A Stolen Life to anybody. It is highly disjointed and repetitive. Nearly all of it focuses on the incredibly mundane. She rarely goes into detail about anything. When she does, it is details of things that just don't matter much. Things like her dreams, playing with cats and dogs, watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, and things of that sort.<br /><br />While I understand and appreciate that to her, these things were very important at the time... it just doesn't make for an interesting read. It might be the most boring book I've ever read. I don't even think she did a proof-reading before sending it to the publisher, and frankly I am surprised that the publisher accepted it as-is. I suppose they just figured it would still make money because of her name. I also realize it wasn't really possible for her to develop proper high-level writing skills since she must have been in 5th or 6th grade when she was abducted, and that's another reason I feel almost guilty about having to rate it so low... but it does show through in her work. It really does read like something a 6th grader would have written.<br /><br />I really wish she reached out for a little bit of assistance in direction here. A bit of guidance would have made all the difference in the world. It is a deeply personal story, so I can understand how she wanted to do it all by herself. It was also a way for her to continue healing, but again... the result is a poorly structured, uninteresting, and almost random hodge-podge of thoughts. There was also surprisingly little about her mother both before abduction, and after being rescued. This really surprised me.<br /><br />All in all, it's just not an engaging read. I would suggest you do not waste your money on it. Sorry, Jaycee!oorly structured, uninteresting, and almost random hodge-podge of thoughts.

B00005N6KG|5.0|When these Sony headphones arrived, I happened to be listening to an audiobook using another brand's little ear buds (the kind with the loop that fits over each ear). When I took them out and used the Sony headphones instead, I was truly surprised. The increase in clarity was remarkable and this design is so much more comfortable for me and stays in place as I move around. Not sure how long they will last (based on other reviewer's comments), but they've been fine over a month's frequent use. I think they are a very good value.

I also didn't like the twist about her friend Joe. But this would be a fine summertime or vacation read. I guess I had heard good things about Nicholas sparks and expected more.

B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is not a  movie you watch for fun.  It can be heartbreakingly sad despite the good that Schindler does.  From a performance point of view it makes one wonder why Liam Neeson spends so much time doing formulaic action pictures and so little time actually working as an actor.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|In briefest summary, this book details the many ways women act or make decisions that sabotage or hinder their careers. Written by  the chief operating officer at Facebook, Sheryl Sanberg knows her stuff and has been in a position to both experience and observe the actions and behavior of women in the workplace.<br /><br />When this book was selected by our book club, I have to admit I wasn't all that enthusiastic.  I am a lawyer and I thought this book would pretty much just rehash the problems I knew already existed for women in the workplace. But I was really surprised how often the authors insights and experiences had me shaking my head in wonderment at how she got inside my head.<br /><br />For example, she shows how women can be just as good if not better at something than their male counterparts, yet women often suffer from insecurities that make them feel as if their competence is a trick that might be exposed and that  \\"the jig might  be up\\".  How true is that? And perhaps I am not explaining that as eloquently as the author does in this book, but trust me there is a lot of wisdom and  terrific practical  suggestions about the things we can do and change to excel and thrive.<br /><br />This book makes for a great book club because not only will you be able to share some of these insights and talk about how they apply to you or someone you know, but you will also be able to talk about your possible disagreements with the author - for example about her thoughts on parenting and combining your career path and having children.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I really learned a lot, and if I didn't mention it, she's very funny and I laughed out loud a lot too.<br /><br />*Just want to add that I read this book on my Kindle and I was surprised when the book ended at around the 68 or so percentile - the rest is footnotes. This is one of the reasons I would suggest getting this as an actual book instead of in eBook form. I don't like reading footnotes that way and there were so many times I would've rather been able to dog-ear the book pages for discussion.nd there were so many times I would've rather been able to dog-ear the book pages for discussion.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is one of my first downloads using Amazon prime.  I watched it flying cross-country.  The HD quality is amazing.  As for the show, brilliant casting.  I am a huge fan of this smartly written series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in less than 2 days because I just couldn't put it down! I would recommend this book to anyone!
B000002GBK|4.0|If you like classical music, you'll love this CD. Wakeman has created a very rich, complex blend of themes with operatic overtones. Each track blends smoothly into the next, with interludes reminiscent of Gregorian Chants. Each movement reflects the personality and characteristics of the principal players. The blend of symphony and modern instruments is well-mastered, each subtly shoring up the other. A must-have for the serious audiophile.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|wasn't what I expected but still worth seeing. the special effects from the movie were worth seeing alone...  (old mafia cars and car chases, old guns, and just raw action). given, at times, the action was corny as hell but who cares, it's 3 bucks.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|voice recognition is iffy but product works well is easy to mount on visor charges quickly easy to use now
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book, super easy read. Left me most definitely wanting to go and read the rest of the trilogy.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This Blu Ray is wonderfully transitioned over. The picture is great, but the sound quality is what really impressed me, its so clear sounding and crisp. Comes in a nice cardboard box, that flips like a book to hold all your discs. A great collection for any Indiana Jones fan
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Great! That's all there is to say about this movie.  It is just all around fun and entertaining!  If you haven't seen it, you should watch it!
0345525558|5.0|I'm the mother of the user! My son gave me this book for my birthday--he knows I love gardening. This is the kind of book you can lose yourself in, and experience real compassion for the characters. The main character is surrounded by those who love her but she is so scarred that she has trouble recognizing and trusting what she has. And the one who seems to love her unconditionally--I realized this morning--is named Grant. I'm rooting for them (no pun intended!)
B00932A4XE|4.0|This movie was very funny, also sad...I watched it while I was pregnant, not a good idea ha ha ha! I watched it afterwards too, its still was funny and yet sweet as well.  I didn't cry the second time :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great! Some graphics could be better. as the game gets faster it gets better. I think the mystery boxes should come up in the game more often but otherwise it's a really really fun game
B008I3RARW|2.0|This game is pretty poor.  Only one track and the racing is not challenging or even entertaining.  Not worth the download in my opinion.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Is a great game to keep  for the grandchildren them intretained, I like to play it also. and the price was right
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I bought this book because it was so cheap. Reading the book has definitely inspired me and now I see myself asking every time I want to buy something new or get something for free. Recently I turned down a gift (a bag) because &#34;I already have a bag&#34; and felt great about it. We all could do with less clutter in life. Less clutter means less consumption means less stress on the environment. Hurray!<br />However I have to admit that the author carries minimalism a bit too far. No couch in the house? Only one set of plates and silverware? No, thank you. We have several plates and silverware and we run the dishwasher only when it is full. And we love our couch. I would arge people to spend wisely - pay more for one item that will last rather than buy two items with limited shelf lives.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I missed Juliana M. When she left ER and was wondering when she would resurface. Cool sho. The only problem is that there is too much good TV on these days. But this is a good problem, right?
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book is definitely funny. She writes about her childhood, dating failures, her job at Second City, SNL and 30 Rock, her peers and finally the Sarah Palin acting in SNL. Several jokes throughout the book when you least expect them, just like her shows. But since this is a memoir, I wanted to understand her as a person. On that front the book disappointed. Reading the book was like watching another show where she is just an on-screen character. There are some bits and pieces of herself here and there but there wasn't any serious peek into her head.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Contrary to most of the other reviews posted here, I find \\"Dead Ever After\\" to be an excellent book, a perfect ending for the series. This is not a romance, or adventure, or monster story. It is a book about love and friendship, heartbreaks and sadness, hope and independence. Sookie is not a heroine, she is a woman true to herself. She doesn't surrender, she doesn't give up. She enjoys the simple things of life: she likes washing her hair, shopping at Wal-Mart, and being a waitress. This need for simplicity has been apparent in the last 3 novels of the series, both in their storylines and in Charlaine Harris' narrative style. It's Sookie becoming more mature, finding more satisfaction in simple daily tasks and ocurrences... And almost Jane Austen in the final choice of her love... Maybe that's what bothers so many readers, readers who prefer the gory, melodramatic and oversexed TV adaptation...<br /><br />\\"The Southern Vampire Mysteries\\" has been a most satisfactory series from beginning to end, and Sookie Stackhouse a most consistent and inspiring character. I have truly enjoyed it. Thanks to Charlaine Harris.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Wow, what a great installment to this series. Vampire Academy is just getting better for me, I like how Rose is growing up and the problems I had with her in the first book are being resolved because of that. All of the characters are growing and we're getting to see so many sides of them, it's always interesting to see your feelings for a character change as the story goes on. I really enjoyed all of the action in this one, it may have started out a bit slow but the build up to see exactly what was going on was great. The plot wasn't completely unpredictable but it was surprising to see everything that happened and the ending was absolutely insane. I was not expecting that at all and it broke my heart. Rose and Dimitri were so close to having a happy ending and then it just didn't happen, it was really bittersweet.<br /><br />I like how we got to see more of the actual couples, like I said before I liked this series because the love interests haven't been the main point of the story and too focused on but in Shadow Kiss I liked how we got to see more of Dimitri and Rose together and Christian and Lissa. I will always love Christian, he's such a cool guy. I have a crush on him, I won't even lie. (I didn't mean to rhyme, I promise.) Lissa was a bit annoying for me in this book, I feel as if she's gotten really ungrateful of Rose and all she does for her. I'm hoping she snaps out of it. Dimitri was definitely swoon worthy as ever, I just love him so much. I'm so anxious to see what's going to happen in the next installment in the VA Series!! Michelle has definitely thrown in some twists I wasn't expecting.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Well worth the money. The graphics are amazing. My 4 year old just loves this app. I recommend buying this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent you want to believe your child. This book showed both sides of the issue. What would you do in the situation?

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult writes with a flow of storytelling that keeps you reading through the night. She weaves a story of young love, Romeo and Juliette, or family passion, a trial hard to stop reading until the verdict. The story of two children who grew up from birth in each other's home, became best friends to a point where their hearts were one...... To love and to help.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This was a gift given to my son.  He has informed me that it has been a really good read and was very please to have gotten it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I very much liked reading this book. The parents agony and fear when they started to suspect that their only child was not normal and in fact dangerous is well written. The change in the household as the story onfolds and the fact that you cannot be certain what is the truth makes this novel almost uncanny.
B0043D2L9S|1.0|I needed a harness for my new camera and long lens. Lowepro has always had a good reputation so I ordered this harness and the tech belt. This comes with very strange clips to attach to the belt and absolutely NO instructions. It also said will fit most sizes. If you are short it will not fit. I returned it.
193700788X|1.0|I loved these books and was sad to hear it was ending but was ready to learn how she would wrap it all up, who Sookie would choose and was really excited to see one of my favorites again ( Quinn)!<br /><br />But from page one I was lost and confused. The book was in no way true to form. The characters were lost in a jumble of forgotten personalities and no one not even Sookie seemed to be themselves. Everyone was pushed to the side for a story line  ( if you could call it that) that was to say the least pointless. We all know Sookie has enemies and makes more every book, but the big bads of this book just seemed bland and nothing was a surprise cause we get to see everything in their POV before hand. WHY? Southern Vampire Mysteries key words MYSTERY and VAMPIRE.  A better storyline would have been Freyda after Sook, that kinda seemed like the logical way to go from her visit last book.<br /><br />****Spoilers****<br />As for Sookie's love life, I don't even know what to say. Honestly, does CH know anything about her characters. Eric and Sook were never my end game but they made more sense than Sam. Ugh, there was no lead up to that \\"relationship\\" seriously, \\"I always wanted this\\", what between every other guy she has been with and nearly been with. Why bring back old flames for a flat reunion. She has more chemistry with Pam. As for poor Bill he wasn't even a contender, she treated him like a distant cousin. How that works I'll never understand for the last hand full of books he's been there practically begging for a second chance and when she's finally free he just sits back and pushes her into Sam's open arms. Yeah, I'm not sure what CH was thinking when she threw this together, but it definitely wasn't to give her fans a cohesive end to a story that has battered us around, for years.<br />Sorely disappointed with a end to 12 great novels.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Great movie. Captured the many varieties of pregnancy. Had everything from no problem childbirth to the \\"nothing goes right for me\\".
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|What was Charlaine thinking?<br /><br />Very anti-climatic.  While I usually finish these books within a day of buying, I had to actually force myself to finish this one over a period of a week.<br /><br />The sex scene with Sookie and her 'chosen' beau was just awkward...<br /><br />Maybe people would be better off not reading this and coming up with their own conclusion to the series.  The characters lacked a lot of their original pizzazz, characters made appearances just for the hell of it.<br /><br />A line from Sookie in this book sums up what Charlaine must have been thinking while writing this 'I was ready to go'.<br />Obviously Charlaine just wanted it over and done with.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|The towering inferno is the greatest disaster movie of all time. I'm going 2 spend some time with this review because this movie deserves it . I have loved every thing irwin Allen has made because I grew up with irwin Allen show I won't name them because every one knows them but the towering inferno is the grand daddy of all disaster movies and this film should never ever be remade because it's perfect the way it is the towering inferno has every thing in this film that any film buff could want a cast bigger than benhurr with the greatest actor of all time Steve McQueen heading the line up of stars it's  action packed the greatest speacial effects that I have ever seen in a film and this is before cgi long before I find the speacial effects are more real than any thing that u see in any film made to day because what your seeing on screen is actualy happening the actors are reacting to what they are seeing not to what they are not seeing which makes it more real and the reations from the actors are real the towering inferno stands up 2 anything that's made today we certainly don't have actors with as good acting ability as we did during this period sure we have stars but very few of them can act the days of McQueen Newman Hackman and Heston are gone . Its great 2 see that the towering inferno has been more appreciated bye it's 2 film companies bye putting in some great speacial features with a back story and making of the towering inferno plus other great features which is more than what I can say for universal studios which have treated films such as earthquake with contempt the towering inferno is the greatest motion picture of it's kind and will remain so probably for all time because nothing has been since in terms of quality and acting and film making 2 even come close to matching the towering inferno
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It does actually charge faster than regular cables. I had to get this because my original Kindle Fire cable quit working and this was the solution!!! Very glad the old cable went out. When you are in the middle of a good book and the battery is about to go out, plugging in this cable is a life-saver...
B004KWVDWI|5.0|I have waited for years for papillon 2 come to blurry and now it's finally hear the picture quality is brilliant as is Steve McQueen whom is probably the greatest actor of all time McQueen never needed words to act with he used his face his reaction a that look across the camera and the camera loved McQueen . Papillon is a great film and why McQueen was never nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery to me
0321543726|5.0|When I bought this book I was not quite expecting a programming for beginners' book. I was expecting something that would talk about good idioms and techniques for c++ among other things. But I am not disappointed. I gave away my old Starting Out with C++ by Gaddis some time ago and I find this a great replacement. It gives a very thorough introduction to things and I have learned things a great deal from it. It is a good book for beginners and a good reference for the more experienced.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is well worth the time it takes to read it. I love it, my 6th grade son loves it, and so do my 8th grade students.
1594746168|4.0|Because I had read two intensely intimate novels in a row (intimate in sense that they were character studies driven by the relationship dynamics for the character with others), I figured that I should take a break and read something a little more fanciful. Like \\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr Spencer Black\\" because when I selected it, I was thinking that it would be a lot like \\"The Selected Work of T.S. Spivet.\\"<br /><br />Oh, how naive I was.<br /><br />\\"The Resurrectionist\\" does share \\"Spivet's\\" use of illustrations as part of the story but while \\"Spivet\\" falls more into a sort of Wes Anderson type of quirky story landscaping, \\"Resurrectionist\\" tips more to Poe and a bit of Lovecraft (except that Lovecraft didn't \\"show\\" so much as evoke terror).<br /><br />Anyway, it is two books really. The first part is about Dr. Black and his story. His experiments, the history of the time that he is in and his descent in what seems to be madness. I've read other reviewers note that it is not for the squeamish and I would say to heed that. As noted, this isn't Dinotopia even if the pictures are glossy. It is told from the point of view of a researcher so there is a bit of distance but still, it gets pretty detailed.<br /><br />The second part is the fun part in that it is mostly illustrations and such of wondrous creatures like mermaids and minotaurs etc.<br /><br />It is definitely an interesting mix of history and fantasy and that is always interesting and it was presented well so I give it a 4-stars. But again, I would take note that the subject matter can get dark at times.
0810996596|5.0|Awesome book!<br /><br />Such a refreshing change on the classic Novel Biography of someone famous.<br />This isn't even about Metallica, it focusses on Kirk's obssession with horror. So it's a great read and has soo much great artwork in it.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|I got a lot of insights from this book. Duhigg simplifies a very complex issue and makes it more interesting by focusing on case studies. I'm still thinking about this book and how it might affect the way I view my habits and those of the people around me.

This app has over 100 pictures so you'll be getting your monies worth for all the hours you'll have to play this game. The colors add a degree of difficulty while at the same time you'll learn new tricks that makes the game easier in some ways......so yes, it's both harder and easier, but with out a doubt a lot more enjoyable. Get out the colors and get going!  Update, this app receives new puzzles to solve at no cost to you. You receive a message that there are new levels installed so you really get a great deal on this app.

B005BC3MBQ|4.0|A fantastic journey through the tragic,  interdimensional story of a pop band who is abducted.  The attention to detail in visual story telling is superb and if you're like me,  you're left wondering whether or not the story was the motivation for the music or the music the motivation for the story; through a bit of research I come to the understanding that the story was written early in the conception of the music.<br /><br />The only downside is that,  at least for my copy,  the way the Blu-ray was authored causes it to do weird stuff and react slowly when starting up and selecting things to watch.<br /><br />Besides all of this, the daft punk album discovery is a masterpiece and if you can't dig the anime,  it still validates the whole purchase.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am sorry to be a downer but this book did not turn out as I expected. Katniss, my role model in the first 2 books is a mess. She was this strong, independent woman, now she can't get her thoughts straight. I know she has been through a lot, but she needs to get a hold of herself. This book was not HORRIBLY terrible, but definitely not what I expected Katniss to turn into.

B004R1Q0XY|5.0|I bought The Joy of Vegan Baking soon after it was released and I'm glad I did. I haven't tried everything in here yet, but I have tried a lot of the recipes, and they're great so far! My favorites are the Apple Cake and Chocolate Chip Cookies. I bake those the most often to bring to picnics and potlucks. The Apple Cake in particular is just amazing! I am asked often to make it for people, which I'm happy to do because it's easy and yummy. I usually cut down on the sugar a little because I typically like my desserts to be less sweet than most people do, but even tweaking the recipe like that doesn't affect the overall quality.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen for proving that vegan baking is enjoyable, delicious and worth every moment!

B009NY43NY|1.0|First off let me start off by saying that I never write reviews on anything.  I'm an avid reader and usually I'll keep my opinions to myself.  What's the saying?  Oh yea...\\"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.\\" Usually I'd abide by that rule, but I feel that this time it's necessary.<br /><br />I haven't been reading these books for years and years like most fans.  I started out watching True Blood, and at the insistence of one of my friends I gave the books a try.  I fell in love with the book series almost immediately.  The characters had so much more depth than in the television show, the story plots were better, and let's face it-- there was much more Eric time.  Honestly, I was quite irritated that the writers of True Blood didn't just stick with the material they were given.  After all, if it ain't broke why fix it?<br /><br />After reading this book, however, I'm left almost happy that True Blood didn't follow the same disappointing end.  I don't know yet what exactly the end game in True Blood will be but I doubt it could even come close to being as boring as the one in Dead Ever After.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />Charlaine Harris built up an amazing book series.  She developed her plot lines, and the relationships with Sookie throughout the entire series, and in the final book she decimated them.<br /><br />Case and point-- Eric.<br /><br />How in the world can an author spend that much time, and book space, developing a relationship that simply just falls to the wayside?!  Anyone who has read these books would know that Eric is not some pushover that would just agree to leave the job he loves, and the woman he loves, to go off and marry the Queen of Oklahoma.  Simply put, she made Eric into Bill.<br /><br />The entire time Eric has been portrayed as this brilliant and fearless Viking who bows to no one.  Well apparently there's someone he does bow to...Freyda.  Eric did secure Sookie's safety in the process but the vampire we've come to know never would've gone so easy!<br /><br />What makes the whole thing worse is that instead of letting Sookie have some time to reflect on the fact that man she loved was pretty much sold into marriage, she forced a Sookie and Sam relationship that was both unbelievable and impassionate.  It was honestly the most awkward pairing in the whole series.<br /><br />Sookie and Sam are friends.  They've always been friends, and Charlaine has done a good job at repetitively pointing that out.<br /><br />Now she wants the reader to believe that the magical intervention to save Sam's life at the end of Deadlocked somehow changed everything?  I call BS.  I would've rather seen Sookie alone.<br /><br />***<br />I could write and write for days about the inconsistencies in this book with the rest of the series, but in the interest of time I'm going to stop.  I have better things to do then rant about a book that was both disappointing and dull.  I will, however, plead with the readers to not read this if they want any fond memories of Sookie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, and don't waste your money.<br /><br />You're better off not knowing.<br /><br />Trust me.

B00BC24NT4|4.0|Le Carre's latest work is a fine example of how he continually reinvents his craft to keep his stories fresh and relevant.  The themes he explores in this excellent thriller are extraordinary rendition and corporate incursions into National Intelligence work and the implications for public responsibility and accountability.  As always the narrative and situations are diligently researched and plausibly laid out, his characters are solid and believable.  Another great contribution from Le Carre to the perennial debate as to who watches the Watchers?
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show was a total &#34;random&#34; choice, but I fell in love with the characters and I am 3 seasons in. One of those shows that your sad when the season ends!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|When you cannot hold it in your hand to see how it will work, you do not know how happy you will be.  I would like to see more versatility from the product.  They need to do more research for how the kindle operates with various apps. Then I would like to see a product that would be just as versatile.  Ultimately it does a great job for protecting the tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well-written, good plot. Chilling psychological thriller. Would recommend. I've bought two other books by the same author since and haven't been disappointed.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Slow to hook the reader but picks up speed.  Not one of his best books but still worth a read.
030746363X|4.0|I read the e-book version first and then bought the paper book version. Some of the advice is quite good. That's why I bought the hard cover paper book. Some of the other stuff is pure bull***t. Just pass by the crap and get second opinions on the rest.
