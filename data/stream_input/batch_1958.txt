B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I was so excited about this cd, bc I love(d) the song: someone that I used to know.  The rest of the songs are not at all like the song that I liked.  It is like some cheesy 70's 80's pop!  Very disappointed!  Do your homework and listen to the other songs before buying.

B000EULJLU|5.0|If you’re a Tool fan you know what you’re getting. Heavy thoughtful lyrics accompanied by equally heavy music. Tool’s music is not for the faint of heart nor the non-thinking.

B008MM9630|4.0|I have had this game going on a year...there is always something new to do...I would however give it 5 stars if there were more instruction on how to get certain items..like I don't know how to get a lucky clover and nowhere in the game does it tell me..but other than that its awesome.

B007BVMVDU|5.0|From the very first episode, the story captivates the viewer. With it's provocative content and beautiful sets and locations, this is well worth watching if you enjoy any kind of fantasy or simply appreciate a well crafted story brought to live on your television.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|The soundtrack is just as great as the DVD, it makes for a great listen and I recommand this to any and all fans of music.
B002GXECQW|5.0|If I ever write a novel like this, my life will be complete. Even if no one else ever reads it. I won't go into too much detail, I think the 1000+ reviews of this book here on Amazon slice and dice it in about every conceivable way. But one of the hallmarks of great art is that it brings about strong emotions. This book does that. So many emotions, so many responses to aesthetics are explored by this book. If you are an empathetic reader, you feel hunger, pain, sympathy, peace, fear, anger, loss, hunger, thirst, revulsion, revelation, awe... It's even, on occasion, funny in a deliciously ironic sort of way. You owe it to yourself to read this book even if, especially if, you have not yet seen the film.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love Captian America it was an amazing dvd and I would recommand this DVD to any and all comic book fans.

143911000X|4.0|Fun Read. Great little book. I was hoping that the book would be for a hard cover. It was not advertised as such, I was not able to find one other than this  paperback cover. Good to read over drinks with friends.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so much fun and it is harder to draw something on the Kindle from your head.  Helps kids learn how to spell too.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun way to pass time , if you can stop. Enjoy this game a little more than jewels original, a bit more addicting.

B0012NO316|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Great performances by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and a true classic of American cinema.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This movie was a good movie showing how 9-11-2001 affected this child when his dad was killed in the twin towers.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I didnt like the story line.  The fashions and actors were good.  I enjoyed Liza and the intrigue with Adian but the story itself was sort of corny
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A fascinating and intriguing read.  On a par with \\"Just Me Myself I\\" [[ASIN:B00AYLN9CG Just Me Myself I]].  Both really thought-provoking yet satisfying.
B00004RFCM|5.0|PERFECT BEGINNING. IT MAKES THE REST OF THE SERIES POP!  THE GIRLS AND GUYS MAKE IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY UP TO THE SIXTH SEASON.  BRAVO SARAH!!!!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I am a Batman fan and also a fan of DC animated films but this is not only the best DC animated movie but the best of the Batmans! I can't wait to get part two!!
B00008PW2D|5.0|THIS WAS A SHORTER SEASON THAN THE REST BUT IT WAS HELPFUL IN HELPING THE STORY MOVE ALONG.  FLEET WEEK HELPED IT SAIL SMOOTH
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave it a high rating because I couldn't put the book down. It kept you in suspense the entire time.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|It does what it needs to do. easy to replace. most people forget to change these and eventually the printers gets really dirty.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|It's all good, don't expect much more than a mild influx of the popular pirate theme into the movie you like best, and you don't be disappointed.  Definitely worth the watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|And I cried. I fell in love with this book. I have never loved to fall in love so much
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Somewhat unique, yet very much what you'd expect, I'm hardly a movie critic, but I enjoyed it.  The wife though the language was a bit much at times (and it was).  Still laughed plenty hard at points
0312323867|5.0|If you liked Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed\\" (the prequel to this book), then you will like Something Blue.  In Something Borrowed, you are introduced to Darcy Rhone, a spoiled, shallow woman who cheats on her husband and is cheated on by her husband.  I came to hate her in Something Borrowed, but was still interested in reading this novel to follow her journey.<br />In the beginning of this book, Darcy was still very much unlikable, but as her journey progresses, she gradually evolves, as she is now pregnant with twins and alone.  I really enjoyed this book and felt that Darcy's evolution was believable and genuine.  As with all Giffin's books, this was a quick read and became addicting.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This duck book doesn't even have the definition of boob ok PLEASE MAKE A BETTER BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!&&!!!!GO do it now ok
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My kids loved this film in the theater and was excited to watch it at home. We must have watched this film 5 times.
B000SGRONM|3.0|I mainly purchased this since it was a Kindle sale and I was in the Christmas mood. A few of the stories, particularly the first one, were funny and I enjoyed them. Others were kind of blah, and some I had to skim through as they weren't interesting at all. If you're a fan of David Sedaris then my guess is that you will enjoy these stories. I'd never read anything by him before, and found it okay but not something I'd purchase again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read from a fan of John Grisham and Jodi Picoult books!  Actually I would say this is the perfect mix of the two types of authors.
B009K0P10K|4.0|Watched first season on Netflix and really liked it. Wanted to catch up with season 2. Amazon instant worked great.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I think Tom Hardy is getting to be the next guy that can play any part thrown at him and make it absolutly beleivable. Shia and all the others did a good job also. Enjoyed it. How do you play a hillbilly and then play Bain on Batman ????? Good job.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Read some bad reviews, glad I didn't read to much into it, nice light durable case for my FIRE, good value.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|We watched this movie with our children when they were growing up and now with our grandsons! Our 3 year old grandson requests seeing it every time they come to our home! Highly recommend this wonderful family musical.
B005FVNJTS|4.0|Bit repetitive in the story and not as colorful as the &#34;Open&#34; book from Agassi was. Still a nice book from an excellent athlete. Worth to read.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I watch movies on Amazon video on a regular basis. For some reason Ted did not stream properly entire movie was consistently interrupted by the loading circle. Wasn't enjoyable for me at all
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game is fun, entertaining and I enjoy it very much. However, I find the cards are too small to be easily viewed by an older person on the Kindle screen.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend who loves Van Morrison as do I.She usually gets turned on and starts taking her clothes off when we listen to him. This was no exception. Thank you Amazon and Van. Plan A worked and there was no need to turn to plan B.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is cute and hard to put down.  I do wish there was no in game purchasing; I find that part irritating.<br />Otherwise this app is awesome.

B00877R85I|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is the explosive first book in Suzanne Collins' post-apocalyptic trilogy. Katniss Everdeen, the novel's sixteen-year-old heroine, has grown up in what was formerly North America but which is now referred to as Panem, a socialistic culture consisting of twelve districts run by the privileged residents of the Capitol. Because of a quelled uprising by the now-extinct thirteenth district, one boy and one girl tribute between the ages of 12 and 18 must be offered each year to compete in the eponymous tournament. Names are drawn in a lottery to determine who will become the designated contenders, and they must fight to the death as the event is publicly broadcast until only one of the twenty-four remains. When Katniss' younger sister Primrose is chosen for district twelve, Katniss volunteers to go in her place along with Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute. After preparation and training at the Capitol, the tributes are taken to a remote location and the Hunger Games begins. As each day passes, survival seems less likely amid threats by not only their opponents but also the overseers at the Capitol, who are able to control the contest's various elements. Relationships are formed and broken as the tributes dwindle, and the outcome is different and more consequential than anyone could have imagined.  Although intended for young adult audiences, this novel reads like adult literature and will appeal to a large reading public. Despite its dark and somber nature, \\"The Hunger Games\\" demonstrates that while adverse outcomes and seemingly impossible odds can bring out the worst in people, some human instincts never die. As for readers, odds are that if you choose to embark on this journey, you won't be able to resist the second and third books in the trilogy!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I started reading this book because the pictures intrigued me.  I think it is one of the most imaginative stories I've read.  One of the reviews said it is a children's chapter book.  If that is the case, then it is a children's book the same way HARRY POTTER is a children's book.  Adults who have forgotten being a child may not enjoy it, but those of us who still have an imagination will be enchanted.
0765325950|5.0|i have not read it yet but i do know that i will love the books as much as the others. i decided to review now because of the one star reviews i have seen. i read BOTH ebooks and hardcopy and find it amazing taht people who claim to be fans are reviewing this books so poorly because of the wait for an e copy. fyi the reviews are for the QUALITY of the item and not to moan about the lack of  e copy. writers work hard. so if you are not reviewing the item then DO NOT post. thank you. oh and when i do read this book ill add on my thoughts about it.
0062082353|3.0|American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S...<br />Chris Kyle  in U.S...<br />Chris Kyle was pretty good.  It's entertaining and somewhat informative
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This is a charming book, but I certainly wouldn't call it complex. It's almost as if the narrator is trying too hard?  Or perhaps I am just over teenage snark as a way to express intelligence. It was a cute read--even if it was about young people with cancer.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This movie was amazing and the transaction was smooth and simple.  By the time I got off of my laptop, turned on my xbox, and got to amazon prime movies, the movie was already there and ready to go.  Thank you so much for such an awesome job.
0307279189|5.0|Great book, exciting story and tons of running tips/research/experiences along the way.  It is hard to put down and leaves you with a desire to get out running when you finish it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am more than pleased with this app. I can create my own relaxing melodies accordingly to my mood and frame of mind and state. I was recommended this by my sister and now I have been referring this to others! Highly recommended, indeed!!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is a fast read and has a really touching story within.  I cant wait to read Pandemonium and the third book that follows!
B003YP7N9O|5.0|I'm certain the recipient, namely a brother, enjoyed it and found it a worthwhile gift and greatly to his satisfaction.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was such a good book that I finished it faster than I thought I would. Definitely need Kleenex at the end dog lover or not!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  Great story of survival and strength.  The characters are very real and the plot moves quickly and ends beautifully!  Highly recommend!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down! So sad when books are over! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a page turner!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Perhaps the inability to use actual names and situations would have made it a better read but I am not so sure.<br />I enjoyed the description of the team insertion into the compound, and have great respect for the planning and execution of this mission.  Having been a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War, I am certain this mission would not have been undertaken given the technology of that era.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on why I am less than enthused with this read.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I received this order in plenty of time for Christmas.  Was extremely satisfied with the product and will order future items.
B002HRE4DI|5.0|If I had to choose the best show on tv ever, west wing would have to be in the top three. Sorkin is a genius. The text is sheer brilliance. Sometimes I had to go back a few seconds just to hear the exact words of a speech. This series has not been dumbed down to suit the mass public, and rightly so. If the viewer is not focused, he will miss a few things. It ranges from great comedy to dramatic cataclysmic events, and at a furious pace. But don't worry if you've missed the meaning of a dialogue or the point of a scene, or what has CJ blurted out at supersonic speed, it is made for more than one viewing. The boxset is a must because it will last, every year, like the star wars, or godfather or lord of the rings trilogy, you will need to watch it again. The upside with this is, you might still be surprised every time you watch it again. Those who like good intelligent dialogues, this is the best you can get. Those who prefer good acting over anything else, every actor of the show has received an award every single year while the show was on air. If you like politics, what are you waiting for? Comedy you want? more than what you could expect.<br />There is only one flaw with this tv show. It has put the bar so high that I doubt that anything else can even aspire to reach the same heights.
B007V65R54|5.0|Do arrogant people ever learn from their mistakes?  Silver`s examples should encourage them to try.  This is quite thought-provoking and well worth reading.
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved this book. It started out a little slow but got a lot better the further you read. Good ending as well.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Outstanding movie and one that brings tears to your eyes at times. So have the kleenex handy. It is well worth watching and putting in your film library.
044654759X|3.0|This was a good read, as expected from Nicholas Sparks. Interesting story with a nice twist at the end. I was just disappointed by the character development; a little too predictable, and not very realistic.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Well documented for a section of the Army Air Corp during WWll - which alot of people didn't know existed. It pays alot of respect to them. And to their achievements during that period of time. I would recommend this to all to take the time to view this movie.
0765325950|1.0|This book is rated one star since it is still a partially unpublished manuscript until it becomes published as an ebook. Thanks for hosing us Tor and Harriet.  Go get this book from a library or buy a used copy, no point lining the pockets of a greedy publisher before the ebook version is here.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Chose this movie for my grandson who adores the Happy Feet series. It was a gift he wanted and the one he got. He totally loves it and can't stop thanking me for it. We saw it together and it is so cute. I would recommend it to people who have small children and want to entertain them for awhile.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not as good as most Tim Burton films but it was still a good movie to watch. Was a little slow in some scenes. Wouldn't watch again but glad I saw nonetheless.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult's writing is fantastic.  My only citicism would be Chris's testimony was not convincing enough.  I don't know how she would have made it better however.  This book is a lesson on not allowing too close a relationship between your child and anyone from another family no matter how close. Same goes for adults. I have thought about this a lot. Fusion according to the psychiatrist was what had happened.  It is definitely not a good thing.  Chris seemed fairly stable, able to handle a gun etc. Because he loved her so much he lost his perspective.  He couldn't deal with disappointing her.  I wondered why there wasn't something in her diary at some point about the creep in the men's room who had abused her.  I also wondered why she couldn't go through with the abortion. Maybe I missed something.
B001CTGQBK|3.0|We love the movie, but the downloadable version from Amazon isn't the hi-def remake we found at the big box store.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book start to finish. It is beautifully written and the characters are relatable...5 stars all the way
B000YABS8E|4.0|The casting of the characters was great and the movie is full of laughs. We need more movies like this out there.
0765325950|1.0|Nothing I can say here has not been already said in the other reviews....no eBook means no sale.  It boggles the mind that Tor is so short-sighted in this regard.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I find the idea very inventive,  A story built on how kingdoms worked in meadival times and yet the threat of winter is coming to the the north with creatures they haven't fought in a very long time.  I can't wait to be able to get the new season, in the meantime,  I have rewatched them a few times so that I will understand what is going on.
B00008DDXC|4.0|If you're a Harry Potter fan, then you'd probobly like this movie. If you haven't read the books it might not make much sense to you since they've cut so much. It's a fine movie, lots of action and excitment, but I prefer the book.
0765325950|5.0|I have been a Wheel of Time fan for about ten and a half years and a fatasy fan for much longer. The tale that both Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson have woven here is wonderful. The battles are amongst the most grand and well done I have ever read. In the Harry Potter series we recieved a taste of what happens when one battles true evil. In the Wheel of Time we see what happens when many stand against Chaos itself. For those who have fallen in love with the characters I will warn you all are on the choping block in this book. The deaths will not be easy to take, the battles will be heart wrenching, and at moments you will feel as you yourself are standing on the brink of hopelessness as you hold your breath ready to read the next scene that will unfold before you. It will be a ride unlike any you have had before. So sit back and enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Story of love, loss and rediscovering who you truly are. It was an amazing read. The story reels you in pretty quick and you are hooked. Times felt that I was clentching my sofa as I was reading.
1451695195|4.0|My mom passed a little over a year ago and I thought my dad may like this book. He said he loved it and gave him hope.
B009DH371K|5.0|As a lifelong fan of the band, I am bound to be biased in my review, but I was very excited to see a concert from the last tour in '86 (as a complete band) on Blu-Ray.<br />Whereas I liked Montreal, my favorite has always been the Wembley set - which is almost identical here.<br />The picture is as clear as I have ever seen footage of the band, and the sound was crisp.<br /><br />I wasn't particularly fond of the inter cutting scenes on each band member wondering around Budapest, having a \\"moment\\".<br />I would have rather this had been an optional feature on the disc, not played in the middle of a song, but that's just me.<br />With regard to the Wembley concert [[ASIN:B005EVVPUE Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium]] I live in hope that this will be given the restoration treatment and put onto Blu Ray - I'm sure it would certainly sell well.<br />Comparing that concert to this is not difficult, but for me the audience are flatter here, whether it's the camera work (which is great of the band) focusing on the band members more, and the crowd participation and reactions less I can't tell, but Wembley feels more immersive.<br /><br />Another minor gripe, I don't know why Another One Bites the dust was left off the Blu Ray, or why Crazy little thing called love was heavily trimmed in the edit??<br />The impromptu bits, Brian's solo, and the very touching Hungarian song Freddie sings, are going to change depending on the location, obviously - but as for the song set, can't we have it all and complete?<br /><br />Shelling out for this set will also give you two CD's of the gig, the less said about the crappy cardboard gate-fold sleeve the better.<br /><br />Obviously a must for fans, for people new to Queen's music, I would recommend Wembley over this.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Love it,so far. Will give a better review when I've actually finished it.<br />Tina Fey's observations & comparisons in &#34;Bossypants&#34; are hilarious.
078322947X|5.0|I usually dislike re-makes of great movies, but this one was gritty as THE WAGES OF FEAR and the acting was also fantastic.  Great suspense and very worth seeing.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I was so caught up in the &#34;magic&#34; of the wonderful Harry Potter books that I think I took J.K.Rowlings writing ability for granted.  &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; is full of intriguing characters & rich dialogue. I enjoyed this book very much.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have seen the Broadway Play of the Phantom 4 times and when I noticed that there was a sequel, I had to get it. It was very good also andI'm glad I purchased it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was quite nice to read it. Interesting...fresh, even.<br />It's not a master piece, but a good way to spend some spare time.
1611761565|5.0|Excellent book. This nbook gives you great insight into the worriors' mindset. It's not about tactics or secret weapons. This man should consider writing another book.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|nashville rocks and the music does too.  All the favourites are here.  I listen to it constantly. LOVE IT very much!
B002ZG99G8|1.0|The Losers was my friend's favorite movie, but I just thought it was a typical action movie meant for guys. Basically a male version of a chick-flick.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|A really well done movie, but a little anti climactic for such an awesome trilogy.  Great job from the cast.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Good game, Asus Transformer TF101, works great.  Wish I could just add stars and not have to type a review!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is super duper fun I love it. its so regular like the comp game or the real card game I cant get enough of it.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Diana Damrau is the most awesome, talented soprano opera singer , she does the part of Queen of the Night better than anyone else. The entire opera is great.

B005FISC52|5.0|It was a good summation all happy and fufilling in the end. All the things that you want to see happen happen. I'm just sad it's over.
B000HT3PPG|1.0|something is wrong with this DVD, not happy<br />the title is Miracle on 34th St , have I not done this correctly according to your rules?
B0030Y11XS|5.0|The movie is summed up by it's parting line: I refuse to live in a country like this and I'm not leaving. Love it. It's heartbreaking and frustrating and my favorite and least favorite of his.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great app on the kindle fire hd 7&quot; the news feed works fine for me but the chat is a little slow but considering its free its great:)

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! I've never taken the time to write a review for any other book and felt I had to for this one. The main girl is inspiring and captivating in her struggles and triumphs. The male lead is real and endearing while having his own set of problems. One thing that bugs me about books is spelling and grammatical errors and I usually notice them but I was so wrapped up I didn't notice a single problem even if there was any.

0375826742|1.0|I read Eragon and Eldest as a 13 and 15 year old boy respectively. I enjoyed both books and always intended to read the third in the series when it came out. As I grew up and went to university, I lost sight of the series.<br /><br />This year, as a 23 y.o graduate, I chanced upon a copy of Brisingr. Remembering I enjoyed the earlier books in the series as a child, I thought I would read Brisingr. And read it I did.<br /><br />Paolini's 'cycle' was originally intended as a trilogy. But Paolini wanted more money. He therefore stretched out a three book series into a four book series. Which brings us neatly back to what Brisingr is: a stretch mark.<br /><br />In all of Brisingr's 700-plus pages, a grand total of nothing happens. Well not quite nothing. Every now and then Eragon has a brain fart. For example, when Eragon takes us on his 20 page ethical disquisition regarding what he should do with Sloan.<br /><br />This book is empty. Completely empty and self-indulgent. This book (I refuse to call it a novel) was written because Paolini loves money, not literature.
0812993292|4.0|Language, humor (or humour), and tone all reminded me of the ten years I lived in England.  This book is at times humorous, poignant, and even shocking near the end.  It also plods at times as Harold plods along.  The final feeling was one of enjoyment with a bittersweet tinge.

B004H8GLXQ|2.0|I did not finish this book because, although the writing is good, the characters Isabelle and Charlie introduced early on are just so evil that I don't want to let them into my imagination.  Of course it is fiction, but for me, the things I read enter and inform my mind, and this is a dark direction I am not in the mood for.

1400067820|1.0|As a frugal grad student, it saddens me that I bought into the hype and pre-ordered this book. While there are a couple of useful speculative ideas to ruminate about in this book--which could have been condensed into a new york times opinion piece--most of the book reads like an angry unedited hubristic tirade, including personal beliefs and opinions packaged as infallible empirical fact based on the authors limited experience and selective examples.<br /><br />I am truly saddened to have spent about 19 dollars preordering this book instead of reading it in the library.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I would venture to say most American movie-goers have never had the opportunity to see a Broadway musical. Why? Opportunity, desire, you choose. And because musicals are a relative scarcity in the multiplex these days, people aren't used to live action musicals of any kind. Many are probably unaware there are different kinds of musicals. \\"Chicago\\", \\"The Producers\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" are the most common form of musicals. Actors speak dialogue and the story moves forward as most films do, but they frequently stop and break out into a song and dance, delivering a musical number that should help move the story forward. But there are also `operatic musicals', productions in which virtually every word is sung and the musical numbers are still there, but less defined. \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"Les Miserables\\" are examples of this type of musical.<br /><br />I know a lot of people who would rather have their toenails pulled out with pliers than to sit through a movie musical. These same people detest `operatic musicals' because they never get a break from the music and singing.<br /><br />If you are one of these people, you will not like \\"Les Mis\\". But if a musical is made well, it can really transport you, enveloping all of your senses. And \\"Les Mis\\" is made very well; a highly emotional, very satisfying adaptation of one of the most successful, longest running musicals in history.<br /><br />The story is very familiar. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman, calling on his Broadway skills) is imprisoned for stealing bread to feed a sick family member. Many years later, he is released on probation by Javert (Russell Crowe) who promises to keep an eye on the criminal, watching for any mistake, ready to jail him in an instant. Flash forward a few years and Valjean is now living under another identity as the owner of a factory making rosary beads. A successful man, he is surprised when Javert shows up in the small town. Javert seems to recognize Valjean, but can't place him. Nervous, Valjean ignores the pleas of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of the factory workers trying to evade the lecherous foreman. Fantine is fired and falls of hard times, very hard times. Eventually Valjean realizes what has happened and pledges to her that he will find her daughter and care for her. Javert also realizes who Valjean is and is hot on his heels. Valjean finds Fantine's daughter, Cosette in the care of the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), dubious inn-keepers constantly looking for more money. Flash forward a few years and Valjean and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) are back in Paris when Marius (Eddie Redmayne) spots the young lady and instantly falls in love. Marius is a very involved in the student movement and will soon help start the French Revolution. Valjean, Javert and Cosette will all become involved in the event that will change the history of France.<br /><br />Directed by Tom Hooper (\\"The King's Speech\\"), \\"Les Mis\\" is a passionate, rousing, extremely emotional and ultimately uneven experience. It is highly satisfying, but because so much of the film is so good, the parts that aren't are even more egregious and annoying.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman has been spending a lot of time performing on Broadway, shifting back and forth between stage and screen. He clearly has the chops to handle a musical and does a great job as Prisoner 24601. He goes through a lot, experiences a lot and changes a lot throughout the course of the story. This may be one of the biggest understatements ever, but to go into too much detail would spoil some of the surprise for people unfamiliar with the story. Let's just say he faces many obstacles and challenges.<br /><br />But as Valjean climbs each mountain and faces each challenge, you always get a feeling for his inner conscience. Jackman subtly shows us that even when Valjean is doing something wrong, he is at great pains when doing it. And he always tries to do something to compensate for the pasterror.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is another matter entirely. He doesn't have the skill or chops to carry the musical part of his role as Javert, the extremely tenacious gendarme. Everything he sings sounds the same which is problematic because he has to show us the emotions his character is living through. He pretty much glares at people throughout the film, rarely giving us insight into his character.<br /><br />Crowe deserves a lot of credit for going out of his comfort zone, but the filmmakers should have stayed away from the star's pull and sought out a performer who could do the role justice.<br /><br />Remember when Anne Hathaway and James Franco hosted the Oscars? There seemed to be two general thoughts about their work; 1. James Franco looked uncomfortable and uneasy throughout most of the show and 2. Surprise that Anne Hathaway could sing. Her performance as Fantine, the single mother working in a factory to earn money for her child, erases the question mark and any doubt. Anne Hathaway CAN sing.<br /><br />I have only seen the musical performed live once and didn't remember that her big moment came so early in the story, but the moment she appears on screen, get your hankies out. Her role is tragic and moving and as she is singing \\"I Dream a Dream\\", you can see the pain and emotion in her face and hear it in every word she utters. Her character's life ultimately steers Jean Valjean towards his destiny, so it makes sense and needs to happen pretty early to drive the rest of the story.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried (who was also in \\"Mamma Mia\\"), Eddie Redmayne, who plays her true love, Samantha Banks who plays Eponine and Aaron Tveit who plays Enjorlas are all good, but when you consider the power of Hathaway's performance and the bravado of Jackman's, these younger actors pale in comparison. They all play a part in sparking the French Revolution, which closes the film.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play the Thernadiers, shady inn-keepers who seem included to provide a bit of comic relief. Normally, this type of thing wouldn't work very well, but their big song \\"Master of the House\\" is one of the most memorable and helps to compensate for the obvious nature of their characters.<br /><br />Watching a film musical is a very different thing from watching the same musical performed on stage. It should be a different thing. When you are watching a play, you are looking at the entire stage and as characters move around, your attention is directed to them. As they move back and forth, your eye follows them. Sometimes, you may be watching a scene between two characters at opposite sides of the stage. But the stage is always there and your eye is always moving. When you watch a filmed version of the same play, the filmmakers direct your attention to the focused performer with camera movement, editing, transitions and more. Your eye will process less because the filmmakers have already done this for you. Naturally, watching a live play is to a movie what reading a book is to watching a film adaptation of that book. When you read a book, your mind processes a lot of information and paints pictures for you, guiding you through the story. Sometimes, reading a scary story is a lot more effective than watching a horror story because the images your mind conjures are a lot scarier (and real to you) than what the filmmakers can come up with. Watching a live play is a very different thing because you have to decide where to look, what to concentrate on. You can also look at the whole picture.<br /><br />In \\"Les Miserables\\", Tom Hooper gives us an intimate view of the story. \\"Les Mis\\" isn't known for great choreography anyway, so Hooper smartly concentrates on the actors as they perform.<br /><br />He has also gone one step further; the actors sing live throughout the film. In most musicals, the singers record the songs in a studio and then perform the roles to a playback of the song. Watching \\"Les Mis\\" is a very different experience. You can see the words coming out of the actor's mouths, feel their power, and it also makes the performances more intimate and meaningful.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is an emotional, moving experience. And a fitting adaptation of one of the longest running musicals in history.

0783225547|4.0|It was a typical disaster movie but there was a good cast that made it enjoyable and entertaining. Worth the watching
B0059XTU1S|3.0|I haven't read the book, so I am unable to comment on the specifics of the book to film adaptation of \\"The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey\\". But Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was based on three pretty substantial books. Initially, \\"The Hobbit\\" was designed as two films, but Warner Bros. persuaded Jackson to expand it to a trilogy. So, a recap: \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is based on three books. One film, per book, more or less. \\"The Hobbit\\" is based on one book. How do you take material for two films and make it three? \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was released on DVD at least three separate times, each with more footage added to the \\"Director's Cut\\". It would seem a safe bet to conclude the three films are being bulked up by this \\"Special Footage\\". But if the footage was deemed extra and cut out of the film in the first place, there was a reason for that. Generally, footage is cut because it slows down the story or is deemed superfluous. But in an effort to wring an extra $13 out of loyal fans, Warner Bros. will release one part of the trilogy each December for three years, guaranteeing a certain level of hype and income to their studio coffers. And the fan who watches \\"The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey\\" is treated to an almost leisurely look at Bilbo Baggins adventure with Gandalf the Grey and Thorin, the King of the Dwarves.<br /><br />If all three films have approximately the same running time, fans can expect a very leisurely journey indeed. Between eight and nine hours' worth of time in Middle Earth.<br /><br />The real trick is for Jackson to make three films, using footage that was cut and would have been included on the \\"Super Special Absolutely Final Director's Cut Special Edition\\" DVD and make the film seem like the original story was not changed at all. In \\"Journey\\" that isn't accomplished; it seems long. Would the initial dinner at Bilbo's house, when Gandalf introduces all of the dwarves, suffered from losing 15 minutes? I doubt it. This is just one example of a scene that is too long and there are others.<br /><br />If the original plans to present two films remained intact, I have no doubt this film would have benefited greatly. But Warner Bros. decision to capitalize on a name brand and eke out an extra film will mar the entire series. I picture some executive at the studio is in his cave, covered with gold coins, rearing his head only to protect the fortune from pillage.<br /><br />Jackson decided to shoot the film at a higher frame rate than normal. And the film is presented in the now obligatory 3-D (all the better to eke out $3 from each patron). The standard for film is 24 frames per second. For video, in this country, it is 30. This is why television looks so different from film and vice versa. I revel in the look of a beautifully photographed film. There is nothing quite like it and it helps to transport me to the fictional world the filmmaker is trying to create. And video has advanced considerably in the last few years.<br /><br />I really admire filmmakers who try to push the envelope and come up with new techniques for or methods of filmmaking. And these experimental efforts are necessary because they keep pushing the medium forward, but if you look back at the early attempts of a new technique you can usually see where a technique started because it looks so rudimentary, so different. The High Frame Rate used in \\"The Hobbit\\" looks good and bad. When the film centers on a computer generated character or landscape, the HFR (High Frame Rate) adds an amazing layer of depth and when viewed in 3-D, the results are stunning; you feel as though you are looking through a window. That barrier between you and the film is removed and you really experience a new way of watching film.<br /><br />But is this a good thing? Do you want to have that barrier removed? It is a bit strange and unsettling.<br /><br />When the film concentrates solely on characters played by human beings, the HFR makes the characters and landscapes look like an old video television show. Have you ever seen an old television show, from the 60s or 70s, using the relatively new medium of video? They look strange and oft-putting because the color is over-saturated and slightly off. Some of the footage in \\"The Hobbit\\" looks like this. Maybe over time, as we get acclimated to this new look, the technique will become better and more acceptable. But right now, because it works 50% of the time, it seems to be more of a distraction.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this new technique is that my eyes were less tired after watching this film in 3-D.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is a mixed bag. The excessive length and decision to make three films out of material already stretched to make two mar one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Jackson's attempts to use a new filming technique show some promise, but the effect is too jarring at this point. The actors are all good, the special effects are fun and well-made, the landscapes lush and gorgeous.<br /><br />But watching \\"Journey\\" feels like you are physically walking the journey with Bilbo and Gandalf. And this isn't a good thing., the HFR makes the characters and landscapes look like an old video television show.

B005OT2YVA|2.0|I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies.  This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars.  The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base.  After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it.  I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable.

You say tor is greedy well guess what they have employees to pay who families that need money for food....so all you haters are the ones thats selfish buy the damn book help support all the employees at tor who work there ass off to bring us fantasy books every year. Just sad!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book was awesome and I loved they funny parts it really cracked me up so bad I skirted milk out of my nose when I wasn't even drinking milk
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. The action was spot on and the drama wasn't too thick. What I enjoyed is the perspectives of the main characters. The first is a 3 tour Afghanistan Marine Veteran who is short tempered, violent, and extreme. The other is a peaceful, negotiating, calm, 'hippie' who thinks things through and talks things out. Make those two people inseparable brothers in love with the same woman and you have a hell of a film. Oh yeah Travolta is in it too
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am going to try my best to do this review without any spoiler because you know how much I hate a spoilery review!  I have had a couple of weeks to think about this book and initially I had thought that I liked it better than Slammed, but the more I think about it I am not sure that's the case.  It's definitely right up there though.  Sky is a teenager who actually has never attended high school.  She has always been home-schooled, but her mother has finally let her enroll in the local high school for the new year.  Her adoptive mother comes across as kind of a hippie.  She is opposed to all things electronic like TV's, phones, iPods, computers, etc...so Sky gets her fix through her best friend and next door neighbor Six, who's name is actually Seven!!  Six likes boys, a lot, and her bedroom window is a revolving \\"door\\" of boys and she likes to fix Sky up with her current flame's friends.  Sky feels nothing one way or another about any of the guys she makes out with.  She literally doesn't feel anything at all when she is kissing them so she isn't really into it, but she goes along with it for Six.  She is going into her first year at an actual school with a, somewhat deserved, bad reputation.<br /><br />Dean Holder is back at school after being gone for awhile and the rumors are circulating as to where he has spent his time away.  The most popular opinion is that he was in juvie for beating someone up.  Sky and Dean share a love for running and that's kind of initially how they meet.<br /><br />Sky and Holder each have secrets that they are either hiding or repressing.  There are so many things that bring them together and others that keep them together.  Holder is really one of the most \\"grown-up\\" male characters I have read in a YA romance in quite some time.  He has a really good grasp on how to help Sky deal with her issues and he is truly the best thing that happens to her.  I just love him!  Sky's story is so emotional and while you will see some things coming this doesn't lessen the impact of how heartbreaking it is for her.<br /><br />There are some pretty adult and very touchy issues that are dealt with in this book so be prepared.  I think that Ms. Hoover did an excellent job covering this sensitive subject without it being too weird.  There is also some sexual content, but I felt it was all done really tastefully.  This is not  your typical YA and I think that's why they are classifying it as New Adult.  It's like a step above YA.  It's not written with your \\"fade to black\\" typical YA sexual situations.  These are tastefully written scenes, but they are written and not glossed over.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I will buy when the print version comes out and I will read it over again.  It's a really great story and I think that's it's really well written.  I usually try to comment on the actual writing, but when the story is this good I tend not to get too caught up in the technical stuff.  I am too busy enjoying the story to worry about all that!  Ms. Hoover does a really great job with the story flow though, and her characters are the characters that I can't get out of my head.  I start to feel so strongly for them that I just can't stop thinking about them and to me that's something that makes a great story and why all 3 of her books were in my Top Picks for 2012.ng this doesn't lessen the impact of how heartbreaking it is for her.<br /><br />There are some pretty adult and very touchy issues that are dealt with in this book so be prepared.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I bought this for mom. What she wants, she gets so she got this on her Kindle. As an avid NON-READER she has been engrossed with this series. I am not going to beat this horse to death with an exhaustive review, me buying the entire series for her means it is great!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Well written and delivered! I bought this copy for the sole purpose of loaning to friends and relatives to watch. I can't stop bragging to them about it!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved the movies and love this set.  Also, my husband is from Pittsburg, and a big fan of Hines Ward, so it's really fun to watch  the third film.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wish there was more to the free game. but over all thegamewas.  fun. I liked that it mixed puzzle games. with. hidden object games
B00797MB0O|1.0|This movie was ridiculous! A complete waste of my time. I actually feel dumber for watching it. A completely worthless plot line, and it just drags on and on... Not a feel good movie at all. Don't waste your time.

B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Not for the faint of heart but definitely worth reading. I know I enjoyed it and I hope you do too!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is the most exciting series since X-files, but much better.  Each episode is highly entertaining and you just cannot wait to watch the next one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Yes I am hooked. This is very addictive and I love it.it really takes my mind off other things so really I can relax
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|there is no save button OR exit button. ive lost hours of gameplay with no way to recover any of it!!!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Absolutely TERRIBLE movie. i cant believe i even watched it almost to the end. When i saw the previews over the summer it was on my must see list. SOOOOO glad i did not waste 10 dollars to go see this crappy movie. The dancing (channing tatum's only because all the other \\"strippers\\" did where the 1,2 half step) was the ONLY good thing (well...and the fact that most of the men had bodies u can drool over) about this movie. And to think they have a sequel coming out. I ask FOR...WHY?? an hour or so out of my life wasted
0142501123|5.0|A kind old witch with a purry cat loses her hat, her bow and her wand to the wind.  As they both go in search of these items, various different animals find them first - a dog with brown spots, a very green bird and an extremely fastidious frog - all of whom want to know if there is room on the broom for an animal like them.  The amiable, though far from stereotypical, witch smiles and makes room for them one by one, until the broom bends beneath their weight.  Things begin to look bleak as the broom falls to the ground. At this point the animals are given the chance to be heroes.  As a reward for their actions, the witch `magics' up a spectacular new broom to accommodate all their individual needs.<br /><br />The illustrations are superb. The expressions on the animal's faces are priceless and the first-rate rhyming prose was such a pleasure to read aloud.  It is a really fun book about friendship and team work, and, although this is a story about a witch, I don't think it needs to be limited to Halloween only - it is more of an anytime-of-the-year book. I can highly recommend this for children aged 2 to 8. Without doubt, a five star treasure to keep for years to come!
0316228532|5.0|I've never read a single Harry Potter book but I know J.K. Rowling can write so I decided to give this a go. Amazing! The author really understands human behavior...so much so that it's almost uncanny. I laughed out loud at some parts and cried at others. The best thing is that there are no clear good guys and bad guys. Each character is capable of behaving well and also behaving very badly (though some more than others!) The end is absolutely shocking (don't read ahead) and heartbreaking so be prepared. Anything can happen to anyone in this book, just like real life, and the product makes for a very satisfying read. I want more grown up books from Ms. Rowling!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I really don't have much to say about this book. It was dreadful––badly written, sexist, boring, predictable, disgusting, and just ... horrible.<br /><br />Let's just say: I would've been spanked about five thousand times for rolling my eyes while reading this.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I tried to play this game and it said I had to be signed into Amazon.  I am having issues with Amazon logging me out on a regular basis which in and of itself is annoying let alone having a game that requires it.  Please fix.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Some things aren't like they seem. A psychological thriller in the enth degree, Flynn has her story and characters down pat. The dialogue is snappy and quick, and I was amazed at how it flowed. Very dissapointed with how the story ends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|See All My Review at 2Gliterarygirls<br /><br />THE GIST: Once in a while a book comes along and shines so bright, you know immediately that it a huge breakthrough hit. Publishers, publicists and agents smell chum in the water and rumors abound. Hopeless is definitely the new \\"it\\" book on the virtual shelves and deservedly so.<br /><br />This book had me laughing aloud, crying, screaming and cringing. If there was an emotion to draw from me, this book dragged it out, stomped on it, dragged it through the sludge, before cleaning it off and handing it back, broken. Hooked from start to finish, it never disappointed, although, there were aspects I found slightly tedious, it was nothing warranting a \\"star\\" reduction. If you love young adult and are over 17, beg, buy or borrow this title, it is worth every hopeless moment.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN: I love books that touch on real issues, especially when it pertains to teenagers. This book does that and more, while wrapping the message in a heart-wrenching read. The main protagonist Sky is a sheltered child, forced to abstain from all things social and techno and seeing her introduction into the modern world is interesting and refreshing. Reading Sky's reaction after receiving a text with the commonly used acronym \\"lol\\" is classic, but it displays the disconnect a kid really has from her peers when she doesn't have access to modern technology, but that isn't the only relevant issue Hopeless touches upon. Some of the peripheral themes deal with intolerance, LGBT, bullying, rumors, anger, suicide, premarital sex, abuse and young love. That being, this book might not for everyone (although it should be). But before you choose to ignore this story because of the content, be advised that the overarching story is about love and finding hope in a life that appears ugly and hopeless.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover understands kids and the issues that many deal with and it shines through in her book. A skill not all YA writers call upon easily. Her voice is strong, powerful, and boy does she have a lot to say. I connected with her and her writing in a way I didn't think I would. Her characters are so well written, each with a very distinct personality. I didn't get lost in any muddled descriptions, because there weren't any and although some parts were predictable, it didn't lesson the impact during the actual revelation.<br /><br />I know many women out there are asking the critical question...was the boy love interest crush worthy? Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. He was delicious, bad, good and smart all rolled into one super hot sensitive package. One of the few problems I had with the book was that he wasn't that flawed. He thought he was, but really...he was near perfect. On that note, the other minor flaw was the tone change toward the end. It became heavy and with this switch came some very preachy and very long diatribes given by 17 year olds (not that the teen population isn't long-winded, they just aren't usually profound). It wasn't enough to make me dislike the outcome, but it was a little heavy-handed. It made me miss the flawless sarcasm that Hoover executed with perfection during the first act.<br /><br />Overall, this is without a doubt, a great start to a new year. I have a laundry list of ARCs waiting for review, but instead of trudging through, I took a minor reprieve to enjoy a little personal reading...I am so thankful I did, because I am now, without a doubt, a  Colleen Hoover convert; a tried and true  fan that waits expectantly for her next addition to the literary world.easily.

B00966TN1Q|5.0|No one in the world does the crime detective novel better than Connelly's Harry Bosch series. Period. Enjoyed the book and read it in a day!
B00785P2QC|2.0|I loved the first two Virtual City products. They are challenging but possible. This one is enjoyable, but impossible without spending more and more money. I refuse to market your app by constantly posting to Facebook. I refuse to continue spending money just to make progress in a game. I would gladly buy the app if it was reasonably possible to acquire invest points within the game and make progress. I want a good game, not a money pit.
B00873GRU4|3.0|a bit slow on the uptake, this one although I do like the style so I hope the further in the better the storyline
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting. Saw the movie first. Started reading and just could not put the book down.<br />I did not like the occasional underlined paragraphs. Found it to be distracting.<br />Cannot wait to read the other two books of this this trilogy. i would recommend this book to anyone who loves mystery/ thriller with little romance. There is enough to make it interesting. A good young teen book.
B00004WPAE|1.0|i ordered this believing it was actual vinyl and when it came in it was a cd with a cracked case i payed fifteen dollars for. I wouldn't be so upset if i hadn't ordered it for my friends birthday
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I first saw this film in a special 4k projection of the restored 70mm negative, as i wasn't alive when this first came to theaters. But wow is this transfer great. the special features are ok, their is only one feature length doc that is worth watching and then the commentary tracks are good. Overall though this film is worth it to just buy for the film itself.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I really liked this movie it was original. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was excellent and Bruce Willis was good too. Check this flick out.
B00AODKSAA|3.0|It was interesting, albeit fantastical. I think it kind of went all over the place but we liked it. We laughed out loud at some of the lofty matrix style scenes which were distracting. I think if it could've stayed a little mire historic it would've been cooler. Overall it was entertaining.
B005LAII80|1.0|This movie sucked, total crap. Escape From New York, RoboCop, The Punisher, those were much better, more original films. This film had nothin but scummy, dirty, nasty, ugly people in it doin scummy, dirty, nasty, ugly things. It became tedious. Also tedious is the characterization (Urban doing his best Christian Bale voice, Heady as mama was trite and ridiculous, Thirlby as the psychic partner stretches suspension of disbelief and logic to the breaking point. She's tiny and helmutless  but manages to survive the whole ordeal unscathed.) Whatever! This film is completely forgettable, nothin new. The 3D was totally dissappointing, felt like I was watchin 2D the WHOLE time, pitiful. It was boring and totally lackluster. I see why it bombed at the box office. I bought this based on all these good reviews, what a mistake. I was gonna buy John Carter based on all the good reviews, but after this dreddful crap, I'm gonna pass on that bomb too and never buy a film based on reviews on amazon again. I suppose the people who give good reviews to Dredd and John Carter also love Cutthroat Island, The Last Action Hero, Showgirls and Exorcist: The Beginning.

0811879542|5.0|This is the best new toddler book I've seen in years. Every toddler I know is obsessed with pushing buttons, and this book does cool things when they push the buttons, without involving any moving parts or noise. It's a brilliant concept.
B008IJTFYW|2.0|If you are looking for an app for white noise to aid in sleep; this may be a great place to look. If you are looking for meditative melodies for yoga or meditation; this is not the app for you.<br />The name of this application is rather misleading. I am happy it was free as I already have a far superior white noise app.

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I make notes at the beginning of every day of tasks that need to be done, number to be in my phone, food recipes, you name it! I tote a heavy notebook in my extremely large purse for this reason.<br />I tried using \\"Notes\\" on my iPhone but was unhappy with the layout.<br />With this app, I can custom design my own notebook, keep daily tasks in a separate book and have creative ideas or \\"journal entry\\" type writing in another. Plus, no more handwriting!<br />You can choose the cover designs of your notebooks, if you want lined or unlined paper; even what you would like your notebook shelf to look like.<br />I also love that you can enable a password on this app. Especially if you would like to keep a diary or journal.<br />I did not give this app 5 starts simply because I would like to be able to sync my writing to email, PC, etc. that would make it the ultimate application in my opinion!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolute wonderful read, loved the story and couldn't put it down.  Especially loved the ending and couldn't see for my tears.Thank you ;D
0316227706|5.0|What an awesome combination!  I've gone through the book at least 30 times and in each instance I fall on the floor in hysterics!!! I ordered one copy and after I received it I order a dozen more.  They made the best Christmas gifts for my dog crazy friends.  And for under $12<br />Now I'm going to get copies for all my other friends -- the book is a SCREAM!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Interesting tidbits about former presidents.  Big egos for sure.  Interesting how they crossed party lines when working together.  Nixon was a foreign policy genius, but a crook from the beginning.  My most upsetting part of the book was discovering the Vietnam war could have ended in 1968 if it had not been for a treasonous act by Nixon.  Imagine how many young men died between 1968 and 1975.  Read it to learn more.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I downloaded this app in order to view youtube videos without an internet connection and it works great. I gave it four stars only because some of the videos downloaded at the highest quality don't play without another app. But other than that it worked like its supposed to.
0765325950|1.0|In other words, I had to buy the hardcover because there's no ebook version available.<br /><br />Horrible, horrible way to read such a large book.  It's very heavy, and the font is fairly small - not something<br />that bothered me 15 years ago when the series started, but my eyes are much worse now.<br /><br />As others have said, this is a stupid cash grab, and I recommend you stay away from this book.<br /><br />For that matter, consider staying away from other Tor books, since McMillan is prone to ridiculous ebook<br />pricing, see Imager's Batallion for an egregious example).
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I got this device after a bit of research in USB audio devices. I got a set of [[ASIN:B001RB24S2 Sony MDR-XB500 40mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass Headphones]] for Christmas. Problem: My headphone port on my iMac is occupied by [[ASIN:B0042F3K9W Harman Kardon Soundsticks III 2.1 Channel Multimedia Speaker System with Subwoofer]]. I needed something to add a second, separately controllable, headphone port to my iMac so I could leave both plugged in and use software switching to change the output device. This works perfect for that purpose. But I got a 2nd, unexpected, benefit. I was not expecting my audio quality to increase so much. I'm hearing details in songs I've listened to hundreds of times that I have never heard before. This is a really awesome device, and I highly recommend it. I will soon be getting the [[ASIN:B008J26ZL4 FiiO E9K High Output Desktop Headphone Amplifier and Dock for E17 (Not E7 Compatible)]] to go with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|HOPELESS is very well written. For the first half, I couldn't put the book down. However, the first twist is fairly predictable although the author may have made it somewhat obvious on purpose. Once you figure out the first twist it's not hard to figure out the second. I found myself bored with the last couple of chapters, skimming them because they are just long tangents that I feel are less than necessary. That aside, I loved the first 3/4 of this book. I'm giving it 3 STARS for its predictability and slow ending, however it is nearly impossible to not want to wish you had your own Holder.

B008MWBY6W|5.0|This is a small camera case for a large DSLR camera. It is 7 inches wide at the top and 8 inches deep. It closes with zipper that winds around 3 sides of the top. The inside of the bag is a soft, synthetic fiber that doesn't look like it will pill or shed. There are two support straps on either side inside the bag that are fully adjustable to hold the weight of the body of the camera off the lens. There are zippered pockets on both sides of the outside of the bag that measure about 4 x 4.5 inches. The pocket on the outside of the front of the bag is about the same size, but it has 2 small velcro closed pockets for camera cards and an elastic pocket for a spare battery or two. There is a padded handle on the top of the bag and attachments for the adjustable, padded shoulder strap on the sides. All zipper pulls are sturdy metal, although the zipper teeth are plastic. The bag has about ½ inch of stiff padding on all sides, and a hard plastic bottom in case you need to set it down on a wet surface. This is a minimalist bag that is designed to carry one camera, one attached lens, and a few select accessories, not a full kit of camera gear. Empty, without the shoulder strap, the bag weighs 11 ounces.<br /><br />Much of the time, I like to carry my camera in a regular backpack to make my gear less conspicuous. To protect the camera, I slip it in a small padded bag such as this one and carry the bag in my backpack. This case is ideal for such purposes--it's roomy enough to accommodate my Nikon DSLR with a 4 inch lens attached. My spare camera cards and batteries are easy to access and quite secure in the front pocket. The padding is excellent, and I really like the stiffness of the bag. I also find the handle on the top of the bag and the adjustable strap quite easy to use and comfortable. The only drawback that I've discovered so far is that the side pockets aren't quite big enough to hold my filters in their original cases. But my remote and other small accessories fit in the size pockets just fine. A belt loop attachment would also have been nice, but there isn't one on this bag.<br /><br />I got this bag to replace a similar bag by LowePro. The LowePro bag was quite worn after 20 years of use, and the top was ripping off. This bag looks and feels a lot sturdier from the outset. The stitching is firm and tight, and the materials look like they'll last a long, long time.n the size pockets just fine.

0425264351|3.0|Ok, I'm a Military Brat.  I grew up in the Air Force and am the son of a Military Brat. Like most military brats of my generation, I got to travel a lot and to see the world in a way most people do not.  I also had to move on a fairly frequent basis.<br /><br />As an adult, I did a fair amount of study into the affects of being a military brat.  I've read numerous books, articles, etc on the subject.  I can see myself in most of the studies I've encountered and many of the anecdotal stories that are reported either fit me or fit somebody I know.<br /><br />That being said, when Child talks about Reacher's youth and how being a military brat affected who he is, I don't know that person.  Very few of the characteristics of being a military brat as reflected in the research or in my life exist in the Reacher character.  I'm not saying that it is impossible for somebody to end up like Reacher, but just that Reacher would be an outlier and not your typical brat.<br /><br />In other words, the back story reads to me like the impressions somebody might have of how growing up in the military might impact somebody without doing any research on the subject.  The problem goes beyond just the long term psychological issues; but even to the plausibility of the events that occured in Reacher's life.  Reacher supposedly was lucky if he lived for more than 6 months in one location?  He was used to moving ever 3-4 months?  That just doesn't ring true.  As described, Reacher always attended public schools where people had known each other their entire lives (as compared to Department of Defense Dependent Schools where kids are used to moving every 2-4 years and are used to new students moving in every year.)  Are frequent moves part of the lifestyle?  Yes, but not to the degree described by Child.  Now some parents might have jobs that had them in the field or remote for months on end, but the military wouldn't move the family every 3-4 months for a short term stint.  Just implausible.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed the book so long as Child wasn't talking about Reacher's youth or justifying his actions by saying, \\"He's this way because he was a military brat.\\"  If he had stayed away from Reacher's youth or kept it to a minimal, I probably would have given this 4 or even 5 stars.
B0007ODLCS|4.0|This is a great set of disks by one of the best songwriters of the 20th Century, but it sure leaves me wanting more. There are many hours of incredible live shows, covers, early songs, and strays from Townes' career, and someone really ought to put them together into a box that showcases the guy's talent as a performer. The studio albums show off his songs well enough but they lack nearly all the flavor of his live shows, being far slicker and more produced than anything you would have heard from the man at the Old Quarter or the Cactus Cafe. Still, this is a good start and an easy way to hear a bunch of fine music.
0792843584|3.0|you can see what the guy was aiming for.  never one to even consider historicity, the director did manage some very authentic stuff here.  but when the climactic battle scene if 1.5 hours long, what can the movie really be about?
0765325950|1.0|Don't waste my time with this blatant money grab.  I would pay full price for a kindle version.  I'm not worried about this 1 star \\"ruining the reputation\\" of the series since no one in their right mind would start reading the last book in a 14 book series.  This is specifically against the publisher.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|not what i'd expect in a bluesman, but an honest (and successful) attempt to play the blues.  also shows some background on american blues history.show
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If you are a teenager or any age I highly recommend this book. I cried along with Charlie and knows how he feels as a teen just in the background. This book just honestly changed my look on life. In Favorite books all of time collection.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Such a beautiful love story!! Worth watching for sure but make sure you have tissues with you!  A great movie for all you romantics out there!
0547848412|4.0|I loved this book. A heart-breaking, philosophical and entertaining tale, combined with Martel's lyrical prose. Despite my reservations concerning Pi's ability to survive such an ordeal, I couldn't put this one down.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Great game for me and the kids. We have thoroughly enjoyed playing it and will continue to do so and have fun
B0058XBUAI|4.0|I was very saddened after Trivium's release of Crusade and again with their release of Shogun. I found most of the songs on these albums (Shogun and Crusade) to be very forced. Random bits of guitar solos that didn't blend with the rest of the song, lyric verses that were too long for the underlying music, and the indecision to go with clean or screaming vocals which lead to some horrible in between sound drove me away from this band. The bands first two albums had what I found to be very well thought out transitions, lyrics, and a good mixture of clean and screaming vocals (IMO Corey has one of the fiercest scream vocals I have ever heard and very decent clean voice as well; I prefer a mixture of the two.) and I feel that In Waves finally comes close to the bands original style. I hope that Trivium continues to produce music of comparable to or better than this album.
0374214913|4.0|Choosing books to read is a very personal decision, but if you like current technology, friendly characters and a bit of mystery, you might find this book enjoyable.
0399160450|5.0|After a couple that didn't quite do it for me, this one took me back to the Cold War books - great read.
1451673442|5.0|This book is already making positive changes in my life.  It makes me aware of how much I have to be thankful for.  I think it would be a great book for anyone, especially those who are depressed or have a negative attitude.
B00AHNTFTW|5.0|This is a very nice Blu-Ray transfer.  There are some indoor scenes early on that are a bit noisy, but everything else is visually stunning.  This is a blu-ray disc from Spain that is labeled as Region 2.  Menu items are in Spanish, but that really wasn't a problem.  It played without problems in my Region 1 player.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Bruno Mars` second album title is a bit misleading. There are not too many unorthodox practices going on here as the album title suggests, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. True, this is a genre bending album that does go a little all over the place during it's journey, but Bruno Mars has never really fit inside one specific genre in the first place.<br /><br />The album starts off in the same manner as Bruno`s debut with mid-tempo Young Girls but quickly changes the pace with lead single Locked Out Of Heaven, the current #1 song in America and rightfully so in my honest opinion. Locked Out Of Heaven has The Police written all over it. I'm sure I'm the millionth person to note the comparison, but that doesn't make it any less true and Bruno pulls it off well.<br /><br />The third track slows things down a bit. A track about animalistic sex and one of the more risque tracks on the album, Gorilla is a low point on the album in my opinion. There's nothing terribly wrong with the song, but there's nothing standout about the track either.<br /><br />Things pick back up with Treasure, a song that if you didn't know you were listening to a Bruno Mars album, you might confuse with a new Jackson 5 track. In my opinion, this is one of the better songs featured on Unorthodox Jukebox. I dare you to not at least tap your foot to this track. It would be a true shame if this song were not released as a single in the future. Afterwards we move on to Moonshine, which Bruno moves on from the Jackson 5 for MJ`s solo career and Mr. Mars channels the King of Pop quite nicely on this song. I consider this to be another standout track from the album and could also see this being a future single from the album as well.<br /><br />Track number six brings us back to a Bruno Mars original with When I Was Your Man. This could have fit nicely on [[ASIN:B003ZJ0ZX0 Doo - Wops & Hooligans]] and is a nice shake up to the previous two songs. Natalie follows afterwards and showcases another side to Bruno Mars. One that is a bit crazy and full of revenge. This is another low point on the album. Not because of the content of the song since I have heard and can tolerate way worse, but because it's a song about wanting to kill a gold digger set right after a track where he's lamenting a past relationship. Just kinda throws off the vibe he just set in place with the previous number.<br /><br />Show Me is the next song and is such a nice song that it redeems the misstep that is Natalie. This song is perfect for beach days and for those who like it when reggae is mixed with their pop music. Probably the most unorthodox practice follows next, with Bruno Mars doing a song with Diplo. Money Make Her Smile is the probably the only song on this album that I can't really compare to anything he's done in his solo career before, but it's not as out there as I'm making it out to be either. It's a nice little song, but being that I'm a fan of both Diplo and Bruno Mars this one was kind of a let down. I chalk that up to more of my expectations than anything though, I just thought the two of them together would have came up with something more wild and crazy than what Money Make Her Smile ended up being.<br /><br />The last track is rapidly becoming one of my favorite songs by Bruno Mars. It's an old throwback tune by the name of If I Knew that sounds like it took place 50 to 60 years ago. This was the perfect way to close the album in that it ends the album on a good note and if you're not pressed for time, even nudges you to listen to Unorthodox Jukebox again after it's over.<br /><br />While there are a few similarities I find with this album when put next to [[ASIN:B003ZJ0ZX0 Doo - Wops & Hooligans]], Unorthodox Jukebox seems to be more alive and adventurous than it's predecessor. If you've shrugged off Bruno Mars in the past, this is a great place to give him a second chance...or a fresh new start if you've never bothered to listen before.  Even with it's [minimal] faults, this is one of my favorite albums to be released in 2012.lts, this is one of my favorite albums to be released in 2012.
B005I548B4|2.0|In old times I'll never wait 10 years to try a best seller author, but I had this idea I wouldn't like Nicholar Sparks's girlly novels. It was as I expected: easy and fast reading, shallow and &#34;deja vu&#34; story. It seems it was written to produce a afternoon timelife movie. No surprises. Read it if you want to read without using your brain.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|loved everything about it - i have read every book that came out  - cant wait for the next one
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love thrillers and this is a good one. But it also deals with the marriage / relationship issues, which made me feel somehow depressed.
B009MO5G90|5.0|The price was fair and it arrived fast.  The movie was great. It looks awesome on my 3D TV!  I can't wait to get the other movies in 3D.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I'm definitely a fan of this series but this particular movie did not jump out at me like previous movies in the series... The action is always great but after those scenes, not much else to write home about...
B005I3PAUO|1.0|If you are a reader who likes cliches, you will LOVE this book.  It is wall-to-wall gung-ho all-American hulking hero cliches.  I could pretty accurately predict what would happen next.  At one point I was almost disappointed that Baldacci had not yet found a way to bring in just a hint of Al Qaeda but then, oh joy, he brought in a touch of those nasty Afghans.  Just a hint, mind you.<br />What are you playing at Baldacci?  I'm beginning to believe you were a one-hit wonder.  You started out with such promise, and have been going steadily downhill ever since.<br />But don't despair, you are not the only one.  Lee Child's Killing Floor was his best, and he's now also hit rock bottom.  Time to call it a day?
B004EK926K|5.0|A nice animated spin on a great story about the holiday season... My kids and I watched this and had a great time enjoying this movie... A+
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anyone that enjoys apocalyptic survival shows will love this!!  The blood and guts are minimal so no total gross-outs, thank goodness!
0765325950|5.0|I got the book Monday morning and I am about 1/3 of the way in and so far, it is everything I could have asked for. I'm giving it 5 stars for now (that may change when I finish it) mainly to counteract the spoiled babies crying for a Kindle version. Don't get me wrong, I love my Kindle and have a full set of WOT on it and will be purchasing the ebook when it comes out, but I have been reading WOT since I got an autographed copy of The Great Hunt in Charleston South Carolina, and I have always intended to collect the complete series in hardback.<br /><br />If you don't want to wait, buy the hardback; if you don't want to buy it, borrow it from your library.  But please, for the sanity of the adults in the room, please cease your whining and moaning!<br /><br />UPDATE: January 10th. Just finished the book and my five star review remains intact. What a great ending for the series. My only wish would have been to see the scene where one character meets one of the returning heroes. I'm absolutely certain that major changes in that character's worldview will result!<br /><br />There's really no point in a long detailed review because if you are interested in the book, then you've already read the previous 13. You know what you are looking for. You know what the questions are that need answering, and I can tell you that most of them are answered in a satisfying way. There are some lingering questions, but nothing like the god awful mess left at the end of 'Lost.'<br /><br />If you are determined to wait for the ebook before reading, that's your choice, and as I stated above, when the Kindle version comes out, I will buy it as well, just as I have all the previous books.<br /><br />It's worth it!
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I love suspense, I also enjoy scary movies this didn't have either for me. Maybe the next time. Thank you
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Well done movie with lots of action and a good plot line.  Only thing I did not like was the party/drunk scene...don't think it's appropriate for the younger audience.
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|Do not recommend. It seemed to be all over the place. Nothing like the Sherlock of old. Poor attempt to modernize.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Loved the plot...it's hard being a hero and behind the mask is a man...very applicable to everyday plus great new Bat toys!!
B005LAIH2W|2.0|It is hard to find something I liked about this movie and I won't be mean and state all the things I didn't like.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Had to down grade it for the lousy ending.  It was almost like the author got tired of it or had to make a deadline.  It was a bit predictable towards the end but it was a decent read.
B002VECM4A|3.0|It may have been based on the novel &#34;Push&#34; but it does not compare, in my opinion.  I read the book and there were some similarities but far from the book. Read the book.
B008N1V11U|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is by far the best game I have found for the Kindle Fire. It was up to date with the most recient movie and had a nice story progression. The graphics were very detailed and the game play very smooth. I would recommend this game for sure.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Glad I waited for the DVD. Not what I expected with the actors involved. I guess they all can't be hits
B00138CYD4|4.0|A couple of songs that aren't to my taste in music,but overall a great selection<br />of older santana songs and some good newer ones with Carlos Santana playing<br />with other bands.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It's great fun - a fantasy blending science, history and romance into an easy-to-read story.  This was an entertaining book.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|Great show that I have been watching for years!  I am sad to see it end, but enjoyed the way each character moved on in their own way.  The series as a whole had some slow episodes, but what show doesn't.  Great show & great casting.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It is great! It saved me when I was at a hottel and couldn't sleep. It helps alot when traveling and can't tote around a fan..  I have recommended it to several people!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this series, only draw back, I want more! It is kind of creepy because this is story of something that could really happen. It makes you think! I am letting my son read it now, I think he will enjoy it just as much as I did.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Excellent read! The storyline is well developed and delves into a plethora of diverse subjects from quantum physics to religious beliefs. The characters are developed enough for you to want to get to know them better. But as in life, sometimes are only allowed a glimpse. I wish I could have gotten to know John  and his friends longer.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Somewhat surprised by all the critics acclaim. The movie is not too bad, but often slow and sometimes plain boring.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I thought the book was a decent end to the trilogy but that it could have ended so much better.
0399160450|5.0|This is the latest installment in the series. It builds on where Lock On left off. As in all Clancy's books the drama builds the more you read. I would liken it to a roller coaster ride, as you move through the book there are ups and downs. As the excitement builds you can not tear yourself away from the action, then you get a chance to catch you breath then off again. Not wanting to Spoil any thing, one surprise is the retirement of Clark, but don't despair, he comes back.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|In my opinion all the good cartoons are in the free preview. The rest is a tasteless and not very funny. This purchase was a disappointment and a waste of money.
B007OUINLC|5.0|I am now in love with Kira Knightly.  I thought she did a great job and was very sexy.  It was pretty perverted but so am I!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|A solid action film, vastly superior to the original and very deserving of a sequel. However I must say that the central premise of being trapped in a tenement block with the inhabitants unleashed on the heroes is a total rip-off of The Raid: Redemption; which if you are a fan of action films is a must see as it is one of the best martial arts/action films ever. This being said the reincarnation of Judge Dredd is definitely worth watching, you will not regret it.
1586212222|5.0|I had not heard of David Sedaris until barrowing the NPR Christmas CD, which included a sample of this book. This was a gift for my husband, who loved the dry humor, and for myself who could not stop laughing out loud. I will be on the lookout for more of Sedaris's books. The audio books are best, I just love Sedaris' voice.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this was just okay. A little predictable. The writing wasn't spectacular. Didn't care for the ending at all.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I laughed out loud about every ten minutes, but the best part of this book wasn't how funny it was, it was her blunt message that being a feminist is perfectly normal. And now I've got the confidence to tell my boss to stop calling me \\"sweetheart\\".
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Very entertaining, with unique take on the classic SciFi pawns...I would recommend this book to anyone, but of course any SciFi fan will love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love the characters, love the clothes, love the romance!  Beautiful cinematography and an interesting glimpse into the past.  Even my husband likes it!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I loved this show as a child and now to have every show to watch over and over is wonderful and I get to share my memories from watching it with my mother and grandmother with my children.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Have never read any of JK Rowlings books so I had no preconceptions. I read the first 50 pages - my assessment level. I either keep reading or give up. I gave up - finding the descriptive element too graphic and sometimes inappropriate. I removed it from my Kindle and  stored it in my archives. Don't know if I will ever give it another chance. Unfortunately  I purchased it based on the rave reviews.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This was a great book but like really come on Teresa dies and then he kisses<br /> Brenda???????????????????? The book was good in the middle though a little confusing like we're the trials really ever over in The Death Cure????????
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely in love with this book. I couldn't put it down. Never thought I'd like the series but I can't wait to read the next 2 books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I believe everyone should have this app great for spending time with God now that you are spending too much time on your tablet so good idea to have it as an app:) It would really help those who don't know God a lot of people are making electronics their idols and not God good idea for this to be an app! Keep a good relationship with God Download this app! Take it from an 11 year old :)
B006RXQBUC|4.0|but then again, how can you go wring with Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio? It's been out a long time and with all the lousy films out there it would be a crime to pass it over.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I know this is a review of the APP. But I look at the APP as just a doorway to a great world of exotic information and a fun presentation.<br /><br />I have been watching TED for years on different media and now just one more reason to sleep with the kindle. Mine kindle HD7\\" and I was looking for a different app and found it on the Kindle in the APP store. It just said TED. I though can this be the real thing? There is an opportunity to do the beta thing. However my finger just said \\"YES\\" and on touch and it was there less than 5 seconds.<br /><br />You have to try this; just be aware that TED is addictive.
B004IAKU9O|4.0|I think that if you like Downton Abbey, Wings of a Dove, Room with a View, etc, you'll like this. It's not as grand as Downton Abbey but I found it entertaining enough and there are far worse movies out there everyday, many of which I seem to get suckered into....you could do much worse, especially if you like period pieces.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for this boxed set - especially for blu-ray. Makes a great gift for the guy in your life!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I find this game a fun way to wile away some spare time. It was worth my download of the game.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Dark Knight is visually and musically powerful and enormously entertaining.  You won’t be disappointed.  Taste may differ about the pace of the story and the coherency of the ending.  I thought the special effects were sometimes drowning the plot and that the ending could have bundled the loose ends better without compromising the prospect for a sequel.
B000002UQJ|5.0|PAUL is so versatile. Love all the songs. Of course I am a big fan of his. This one is really good.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Total Recall is more than a remake of the original film, it's an engaging new story based on the central premise of the original story: manufactured dreams and memories.  Moving the focus from Mars to a post-war Earth allows the writers to intertwine current day concerns about violence and war.  The story connects much better with the viewer.  The action scenes are excellent but tedious – they could be shorter or fewer without losing effect.  The ending is classic and enigmatic.
B000I186FW|5.0|Love this movie. Yes, a very obvious nod to our dysfunctional Right Wing Tea partiers in the USA, but still a well done movie that can hopefully open a few minds. We must remain vigilant!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was excellent. I can't believe I got to read it for $3.99 (on my kindle). Colleen Hoover is a First rate author, I will definitely be reading more of her books. Plot greatly exceeded my expectations. So many times you read a good book and like it (love it) even though you know where its going...this one is a total shocker many times. It was a moving book that kept you captivated. I Highly Recommend reading Hopeless, you will not be sorry.
B005KQVDH8|4.0|Don't think, just enjoy!! A very simple movie but one of my daughter's all time favs. Good guys win! Who can ask for more?
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another good one from Michael Connelly.  Great mixture of personal and professional life. His relationships within LAPD keeps things going.  Good action on all fronts.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|A surprisingly low key movie that flows nicely. Scary stuff if you think very much about this dystopian world, but a well acted and directed movie that is enjoyable to watch (if a bit disturbing in places).
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Whenever I need to find something, no matter what, I go to Google search and get the answer right away.  Love it and always find it so useful.
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|I bought this CD for my 69 year old mother and she literally listened to it until she wore it out. Must get another one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is absolutely amazing. Not one part of the book is slow, but every word keeps your mind in the book.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|What a classic!  What a great gift idea!  I loved reading the book that was included!  What a great family experience!
0140501711|5.0|My kids loved this book. They wanted it read over and over. They each wanted copies now that they are adults.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Interesting but a bit hard to control with fat fingers! Good mind exercise in spatial and stress point relationships. Good graphics for a small screen. I'm enjoying it.<br /><br />The people who think it's too slow should stick to their space raider games!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The discs were sent overnight, arrived in the middle of the day.  Even better to get started on Season two.  Great service.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There was so much hype about this book.....highly disappointed would not recommend this for purchase. If you most read it try to borrow it from someone.
0394401522|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Not only is it a part of history, but the recipes are divine. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys cooking.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I had never read the book before.  It's a lot different from the movie.  But a great read.  Will read again someday.  It's my favorite.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|Florence and the Machine make amazing music! It's like, pop, rock, orchestra, choral, blues, and magic. The music plays with so many dynamics, from a simple melody slowly growing and morphing into a full on choir-like vocal blend with massively intertwined instrumental backdrop. The lyrics are different and refreshing. Listen to just one song, any song, and you'll want to listen to the rest.
0810993139|5.0|I purchased the whole set minus one book.  She has two left to read since christmas.  My daughter loves this kid.

B000LGZHDS|5.0|Gary is so cute. I am not a big SpongeBob fan but my granddaughter Kali is.  She wanted a different gift but her parents were getting that for her. It was not a difficult choice choosing this item. I was surprised at the quality of Gary. Thanks.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|Not as good as his previous books, but a suspenseful ending.  Jack is a great character!  Time for the next one!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see a Pac-Man app. while searching for games for my daughter. Suffice to say, she got tired of waiting for me to hand over the tablet because I was too busy playing this game. Warning, can get frustrating because the thing doesn't seem to turn when directed sometimes.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of the only shows I can't wait for Netflix/DVD for.  If I miss it when it's on, I MUST buy it on Amazon Video.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good!<br />Can't wait to read the third one. I never read the first one just saw the movie but fell in love it the series with this book
0375812024|5.0|Love his stuff, great for vocabulary enhancement, we used this as a great primer before our child took her first flight
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Decent clock, worth the download. Not annoyingly bright, sits on your nightstand and does its job well enough to actually use it when you need one.
0385536828|5.0|this book is smart, fun, entertaining and surprising. I loved it! The characters are beautifully drawn, droll, funny, real, dimensional and not always likable which makes the book more interesting. McEwan is brilliant and he delivers his upper crust cast of misfits with equal parts of heartfelt humanity and pathos ... caught in the mire of bureaucratic idiocy.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have found this to be one of the apps I depend on to get through my day with my Kindle Fire.  If you are like me with your Kindle joined to you at your hip then this is a great accurate tool to help get you through.  GET IT!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|Excellent collection of Bryan Adams work. He is truly astonishing and this album is superb. You will not be disappointed.
B004YZ3MHK|5.0|My wife and I are completely happy with this dvd.  We had seen it on PBS and were thrilled to be able to acquire this dvd for a very nominal price.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|El Divo can do no wrong. Their voices magically blend together. When I play their music, it's &#34;volumes up&#34;. They are still my number 1.
6305320802|5.0|We were thankful to be able to find this film at a very nominal price.  We viewed it and it brought back the memory of viewing this movie at a theater about 30 years age.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The movie while being predictable throughout was well played music enjoyable and though the story has been told a million times ie rebellious teen gets turn around in right direction, it just never gets old for me
B000EXZI14|5.0|The product is perfect.  This just what we had hoped for.  The Beegees were a great singing group.  Makes us feel young to hear them again.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|it was a very fun my ness. love it. i would see it again hope you like to take care
B0063IH60K|4.0|while I don't \\"like\\" the ads, I didn't pay anything for the game so I can't really complain. good action, and the mindless time waster I had hoped for
0451457994|5.0|Now I understand what the movie was about. The book is a classic and must read for sci fi fans
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Keeps my 6 and 8 year olds entertained.  Game works well - no glitches or hangups! Cute graphics and sound effects.  Well made game.
1601252463|5.0|Tons of detail and optional changes to existing classes as well as several new classes. Cool ideas abound, it's totally awesome.
1611136849|5.0|Listened to the book on a solo car trip from Northern Michigan to Iowa.  Very entertaining and made the 10 hr trip much faster.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great spacial puzzle game, pleasing design. You will be surprised at how quickly you can complete the levels despite the number of flows. The tougher levels require you to zigzag to fill up empty space.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I personally didn't care for this movie. I thought they made the characters so brainless it was unbearable. I thought Noomi Rapace (Elizabeth Shaw) was a horrible addition to the film. I found her utterly annoying and unbearable to watch. I did however love her in Sherlock Holmes and Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. The plot was not the greatest and I am highly disappointed in Riley Scott. I think that we are so starved for a good alien/scifi movie that we think we like it. The footage was awesome and crystal clear, the way a Blu ray should look However, I did give it 3 stars because my husband said it is an awesome movie and demanded I give it 5 stars. I decided to be fair and go in the middle...3 stars.  We do not own a 3D TV so we cannot comment on 3D quality but the Blu ray 2D quality is great.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I almost put the book down halfway through; it dragged very badly through the first half.  The second half was beter, and was bearable, but could not make up for the first half of the book.
B006H5120E|3.0|I do not own a 3D TV but bought this set anyways because I probably will own one in the future. I cannot tell you how the 3D is but the Blu ray looks grainy. Not Blu ray quality at all! My husband said I got ripped off and that the quality of the movie should not even get 1 star. I gave it 3 star because the movie is great but the Blu ray quality need to be worked on.
B008220D5K|4.0|It was an unpretentious, funny, easy to watch movie and whoever doesn't find Paul Rudd funny, well, is nuts. This film was great for a comedy that focuses about this particular married couple and its family, with problems of their own and who deal with turning 40 years old. It doesn't mean this is the way people feel in their 40s, it's about them, \\"functional or dysfunctional\\". About the family who appeared once in the \\"Knocked Up\\" movie but now they're the protagonists. Don't take it seriously and you will get lots of laughs. I recommend it.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Anyone who loves Christmas movies must own this collection. I am in my 20's and I absolutely LOVE the Carpenters so this was a no brainer when it came to purchasing this.
B00860YICC|5.0|&#34;The Legend of 1900&#34; is one of the best movies you've never heard of. It was overlooked by many major awards ceremonies but should be in every video collectors' collection, as it's one of the best movies ever made, and I don't say that lightly. Tim Roth leads a stellar ensemble cast who bring this movie to life. Great cinematography, great story, great sound, great music, just a terrific movie all around that no matter how many times myself, or my friends watch it, we never tire of the movie. It's one of those classics that stay with you. After watching it, I immediately ordered the soundtrack and have never been dissatisfied. You'll be losing out if you do not purchase this movie and have it in your library. No one I've ever communicated with who has seen this movie has ever been dissatisfied and have always been surprised at the beauty and magnificence of this movie in its totality. There are no &#34;bad parts.&#34; Shut the phones off, pull the shades, don't be interrupted, grab your spouse, kids and or friends and treat yourself to one of the best movies of all times. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This movie is a treasure for the times and will never grow old. Two thumbs way up! God bless and make it a great day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome to get it is the best game ever! Be careful because it doesn't have a crafting  GET IT NOW! WORTH THE MONEY
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I bought &#34;Green Lantern&#34; on a whim, as I'd seen part of it at a hotel and was intrigued. When I got home and it arrived I was pleasantly surprised as it is a fun matinee movie. No it's not academy award quality, but it's a fun and enjoyable movie. I must caveat that with the explanation that I am a Ryan Reynolds fan, and this movie did not disappoint me. Very good special effects, good story line of good versus evil, and everyone starring in the movie looked like they were having a good time. A goodhearted fun movie for the whole family, and another one of those you find yourself watching over and over without getting bored with the movie. I'm sure some reviewers will find flaws, however I'm not a &#34;perfectionist,&#34; but a life long movie fan and have enjoyed this movie at all levels, and believe you will also. Do yourself a favor and sit back and just enjoy the movie like you would a good comic book, or other enjoyable avenue. Don't believe you'll be disappointed. God bless and make it a great day!
B004W25KKW|5.0|This book was a fascinating read, following the author's investigation and then application of memory techniques to successfully compete in the US memory championships. As well as the fascinating story there is enough information to successfully apply the memory techniques yourself, which I have done and will continue to do - so far I have used it to memorise the Periodic Table and am now working on card and memorising geographical facts.<br />Well worth the read

Charlie knows something but he's tried to un-know it.  When you try too hard to un-know it haunts you.  This book will haunt you.  Teenage years are hard.<br /><br />I know.<br /><br />Can't un-know that.
0765325950|1.0|This is my first review on this site, but I need to express my opinion. I couldn't express my bewilderment when I saw on Brandon's twitter that AMOL had been released, and I went to purchase the kindle version on Amzaon and it wasn't there.<br /><br />Not set to release until April? Really? The publisher and Jordan's widow are archaic, and their book will suffer for it. Are VHS released first, and then the DvD's after? MORE people read ebooks than hardcovers. Such a greedy money grab is simply insulting to both Jordan and Sanderson.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing the cinder block that is this book. I'd have been happy to pay the full $20, as I take my kindle everywhere I go and it is so much more convenient than dated wastes of space and paper. And if they really made this foolish move because of piracy, their idiocy is beyond words. A pdf version of this book will be out on Piratebay within days. And hell, I might download it and send Tor a check for $20.<br /><br />But the 1 star is a protest for the publishers screwing over the majority of their fanbase. I am so sorry Brandon. AMOL has 2.5 stars on the biggest book retailer, and sales will indeed suffer. But, sometimes the shortcomings of your colleagues can also hurt you. Maybe you should self publish from now on, and break ties with the money hungry bloodsuckers of the industry.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great read!! One of the best books I have read in a while! Definitely shows what true love really is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Anyone who like futuristic, bloodthirsty books should read it. Susan Collins really did it with this book. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B006QS0PF0|2.0|I am listening to the audio version so it maybe a different experience then reading the book. I like portia but this is hard to listen to her go on and on about what she eat her disdain for fat people comes thru on the audio version loud and clear by the middle of the book I started rooting for the eating disorder.

0374275637|2.0|Reading this book is like chewing on celery. It does provide some benefits but there are far less tiresome ways to receive intellectual nourishment. It looks as though Kahneman has not written many books, which might explain why he jams in every conceivable example to support the same point on how people appear to think. He never spends 3 pages explaining an idea that could be explained in 20 pages. Kahneman rightly cites Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" on numerous occasions but those of us who have read Taleb are likely to find Kahneman repetitive and dull in comparison. This waffly book should have been a punchy exposition of a few ideas like Gladwell's \\"Outliers\\", which made its key points in a very entertaining and fat-free manner. Read a synopsis somewhere or borrow from the library and skim it if you must but don't commit to reading the whole 418 pages unless you are hellbent on self-flagellation. The fact that I did make it to page 418 (admittedly with some skimming) probably reinforces Kahneman's point that we often don't know what's good for us!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think this is a really good book I love all of the books so far I recommend these books
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this, especially the memory. I Don't do a lot of calculating, but it's easy to use and I love the memory. Nice big display.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book.  Dawson and Amanda's story was amazingly sweet and sad.  The modern times Romeo and Juliet.  Loved it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Focusing on the personal side of World War II this book tells the story of a group of fascinating individuals and how the horror of war is overcome by the positive power of the human spirit and how continues well after the war.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Everything you always wanted in a utility app: simple, helpful, unobtrusive. There when you need it, invisible when you don't. I use it several times a day for estimates on when I need to juice up. Am grateful for this little freebie. Whoever complained it did not work with Kindle Fire HD must have a prior version. The version I installed in Dec. of 2012 is perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an amazing book. It's really fun and very exciting. Suzanne Collins is an excellent writer.  Best book I ever read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow!  This is an incredibly gripping, tense, dramatic adventure!  I admit, I bought it because it was cheap.  I wound up absorbed in the book.  I read non-stop as fast as I could.  Incredible detail, humorous, with several nods to \\"Apollo 13\\".  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Give it a try for 5 pages, and I bet you'll finish it within a few days!<br /><br />Some salty language, but I bet that if I were stranded on Mars like the protagonist that I might do the same.  I would like to think I might survive, but this book details all the real dangers of such an adventure.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />-Eric

1400069289|5.0|From the opening paragraph to the neat wrap up at the end, I found this book both informative and entertaining which together are often hard to find in a good read.  For the person who approached this book as self help and as an opportunity to break free from potentially damaging habits I would suggest you should not have begun your search in the business section at the book store.  This book is clearly an insight to a world of sales and marketing and has very little to do with changing your life on any other level.  As a person who consistantly looks for ways to improve in business and marketing I could not think of a more approachable book from an author who's only downfall is that he doesn't pretend he knows more than he does, which apparently leads some reviewers to believe that this book should be discarded.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an edge in sales and marketing and have in fact recommended this book to a number of colleagues and friends.... so there you go.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|It is not so easy to get the recordings of those two wonderful pianists these days, so this box set's collection becomes a 'must' for pianophiles.<br />Even so, there are a lot more great stuff than these two eminent pianists.<br />True that the works included are more eastern European, but that is in line with the overall character of this high quality collection.<br />Dorati, Starker, Sxeryng, and a couple of Kubelik's signature recordings will surely wet your appetite for Slavic music. The Romeros rock with their guitar music.<br />There are, however, little vocal music, with the Dorati's Bartok opera 'Bluebeard's Castle' the only outing in this genure.<br />These vintage recordings are all given high quality sound treatment.<br />Indeed, at the price I got it, this box set is a real bargain.<br />Small wonder that its value has since appreciated more than 2 times over!

B005USZML4|5.0|Although I'm not anywhere near young adulthood I enjoyed this book. Theodore is a do the right thing adventurist character who shows a creative mind and spirit. There is as minimum of violence yet a realistic approach to problems young adults might face in today's world. Mr. Grisham writing is always good he always tells a intriguing story.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story was perfect and the fighting, romance, and everything about this book is great, this book is my favorite series and the best books I have ever read. Rick Riordan is an excellent author.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|Some fans don't like this album.  They decry this stage in the bands evolution - too many synths, not enough Alex, etc.  I have to respectfully disagree.  While Lifeson's playing is sometime sparse, it's perfect.  There's some great songs on this album.  I won't go through all of them, but in what seems to be somewhat of a tradition, the last song is, for me, the killer.  Available Light is one of the best songs they have ever done.  Add in great pieces like The Pass, War Paint, Red Tide and the title track and you have a pretty well put together album.  Geddy's voice is prime, their mastery of their craft is evident and it's a tight offering.<br />I highly recommend it.  It's one of those albums that I return to every once in a while and end up listening to it multiple times.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie was really not good.  The script was rote, the performances were flat, and the whole thing just seemed like everyone mailed it in.  I also don't get Clint... he plays the same role in every movie.  Maybe it's a generational thing, but I don't understand why he's so beloved.

B009X01C64|4.0|I've used this case for over a month now and feel that I can honestly evaluate it. This is a very good case, promising good features and providing them as well. The case has a good feel to it. The quality begins with the feel. It continues to the inside as well providing good protection for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; I've dropped my KF several times with no worry about damage. The tablet turns well from portrait to landscape and back. Admittedly, it was somewhat stiff at the beginning, but has relaxed to an easy turn while maintaining enough friction to keep the KF in place. Some reviewers said they had difficulty fitting their KF into the case. I did too, until I placed it on a table. Then it snapped in with ease.<br /><br />The only disadvantage I find is that it adds to the weight of the KF, but that is to be expected. I've found that everything comes at an expense. Providing security and swivel had to cost something. That something was weight. I can't fault the case for that. I expected it.<br /><br />Yes, I recommend this case to anyone who wants the advantages of a swivel case and security.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it met all of my expectations. The survival mode is very challenging however the creative mode is fun if you don't want a challenge.
0930289234|5.0|Can a work of great fiction derive from a medium that many would consider juvenile? I would say this work does, the plot is layered with enormous stories contextualized in this world of 1940's through 1980's superhero lore. The end raises questions about internal struggle, and what being the good guy really means.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I always saw this book under my \\"recommended\\" and I always put it off because it was a \\"cancer book\\". And I remember watching a movie about two teens that are both cancer patients and they fall in love... (they both died in the end) Anyways that movie effectively put me off anything having to due with sick, star-crossed lovers.<br /><br />While many people say this is \\"NOT a cancer book\\", I have to disagree. It is. It's everything people avoid because it's real and depressing. HOWEVER, this book is so much more than a \\"cancer book\\", and I can't picture the impacting result happening if cancer wasn't a big part of the book. So, don't be put off by the cancer aspect, but be prepared for it.<br /><br />(And begins the rant about how amazing this book is)<br /><br />This book surpasses everything I have been forced to read as a student, screw the classics - give me more John Green!! The author is an absolute natural; his words just flow and he has the way of making the story so much more than just a story. I can't even write a review to do John Green justice, all I can say is that it is a pleasure to read anything written by him.<br /><br />The story itself puts Romeo and Juliet to shame. The connection between the two is so deep and real that you find yourself falling in love aswell. ( Not in a creepy \\"I now have a fictional boyfriend way\\" but in way that these characters will always stay with you).<br /><br />Hazel is one of a kind.. that's really the only way to define her. She's strong, obviously, but she's so rational that it's refreshing. I think the phrase, \\"an old soul\\" is how I think of her. Truly amazing character.<br /><br />Now, Augustus (LOVE THE NAME), is something else! While Hazel remains accepting of the fact that her time is limited, Augustus isn't. The reader gets to witness his struggle with death. It's a sad one, but mainly it's a fun one. His zest for life and for rememberance is so relatable yet unrealsitc.<br /><br />Anyways, I am rambling. Thisbook is worth the $11 dollars. I actually feel smarter from reading it! I also want to cry and mourn fictional characters, but never-the-less, I loved this book. Easily one of my favorites.<br /><br />Buy it.<br /><br />BTW, John Green is AMAZING!
B009HELT3C|4.0|I reserve 5-star ratings for movies that not only entertain me, but touch me somewhere besides my funny bone or an academic appreciation for it as a piece of art. 4 star ratings, however, will still get me to buy the Blu-Ray, which I did the day after we streamed it from Amazon Prime.<br /><br />We liked the writing, the chemistry of the characters, and especially Josh Brolin's frighteningly accurate take on a young Tommy Lee Jones. I didn't even miss the worms or the bugs from the earlier films. And the 70s sets were so spot-on I kept thinking things like, &#34;...they must have raided my mother's basement for that TV set...&#34; I also liked that the writing didn't beat the 70s theme to death--that era was perfectly capable of beating itself to death with no help at all.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the ride...

0316035904|4.0|\\"Holidays on Ice\\" is a holiday-themed collection of mostly previously published stories by the American humorist and short-story writer David Sedaris.  Since two-thirds of these stories have been published in other anthologies of Sedaris's work, this book might most be appropriate as a holiday gift for the uninitiated or for the collector.<br /><br />The piece that leads off the collection is Sedaris's wry \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" which brought Sedaris national acclaim when he read versions of the story on NPR in the early 1990s.  Later, in the mid-1990s, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" was adapted for the stage.  The story consists of a series of anecdotes based on Sedaris's real-life experiences working at Macy's Herald Square.<br /><br />For the benefit of those unfamiliar with his work, I'll point out that Sedaris often finds humor in dark and absurd subject matter.  (At a reading once I heard him recommend Gordon Grice's \\"The Book of Deadly Animals\\" for its humor value.) His detached and jaunty air about such things can be unsettling and yet perversely funny.  For example, in \\"Let It Snow,\\" a story set during his childhood, Sedaris and his siblings convince their baby sister to lie on their snow-covered street so that she'd get run over and shame their mother, simply because she'd forced them to go outside and not come back in the house.  In another instance that made even me cringe, in \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" a foreign youth acting as a babysitter kills a child after misunderstanding directions given her in English.  At the very least, you are never going to be bored by a Sedaris story.<br /><br />Occasionally, a story can be touching, even one that bears the unpromising title of \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\"  I particularly liked reading this tale in which one of Sedaris's sisters at Christmas time heroically reaches out to rescue an abused woman.  Sedaris's usual bluntness and uncompromising observations helps bring out the sweetness of the piece.  It's the closest to being a \\"true meaning of Christmas\\"-type story in the book.<br /><br />The cover art suggests that these are all winter holiday stories, but, in fact, there are a couple of stories that relate to Easter and Halloween.  These, too, are delightful yarns, but feel a little out of place in a book of stories principally set during Christmas.It's the closest to being a \\"true meaning of Christmas\\"-type story in the book.<br /><br />The cover art suggests that these are all winter holiday stories, but, in fact, there are a couple of stories that relate to Easter and Halloween.

111846446X|4.0|Only &#34;bad&#34; thing is that it contains a lot of Linux know-how which I already know. But since this device main aim is not at adult tinkerers but children I can easily forgive that.<br /><br />To anyone new to Linux and hardware tinkering this little book would be beyond 6 stars, since also contains a nice programming intro to the Python language.<br /><br />The hardware experiments bit is juicy but somewhat short.<br /><br />In short for its price and content is nice to have though no earth shattering material would be covered. Is a general purpose starter guide. And does its job well.

I won't get into names here.<br />Some of them don't need to be plugged in to sound great.<br />Disk is a mix of good and bad, but would buy again for the gems.<br />Shipping in an padded envelope ensured that the case would be cracked upon arrival. (not such a big deal I guess)
B005OK721G|5.0|Plenty of action with a story. Hope that maybe a follow-up movie is made. I also liked the filming locations.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Excellent music by a premier entertainer. This girl can sing!<br />Would buy this again, and probably will once this one is scratched up from use.<br /><br />Shipping in an padded envelope ensured that the case would be cracked upon arrival. (not such a big deal I guess)
B002RI9UBS|4.0|enjoyed the story, fantasy and the way Yann approaches the subject of religion and believe. will read this book again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story!  Enjoyed the humor and romance and the connection between the characters.  Would/will recommend to friends. A great read.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|When I first got this game I played it every day unlocking all the people and getting 67,319 coins. Then it toke all my coins away and people and made me restart. I was warned about this by other people but ignored them. This proves its going to happen to you at some point. Even if you didn't get everyone it still does it.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I enjoyed it, but was surprised by the incorrect word usage that occurred. For instance, &#34;taught&#34; instead of &#34;taut&#34;, etc. There were about 4 or 5 instances of this type.
0765325950|5.0|1 star for no eBook? This is easily the best book in this entire series, and the best ending to any series I have ever read or watched. Do us a favor and don;t rate a book based on not being able to get it in your format, just write angry letters to the publisher. Anyone with half a mind can see that 1 stars are from people who didn't read the book while the 5 are from the people who do.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I haven't enjoyed a book this much since the Princess Diaries series. I recently read the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy and wanted to read more romance books. I went to various sites to see which books were doing well, and the ratings on Amazon for this book were good. Although, honestly, I don't think the book summary does the book justice. It's more interesting that the summary makes it seem. I went into it unsure, but after a little while, I loved the book and finished it within a couple days.<br /><br />The book has a lots of great characters with their own perks and flaws and things that make you laugh. Additionally, I've always been a sucker for the romances that develop from friendship, so this book served me well in that area. And for being a romance novel, it didn't feel too cheesy for my liking. It still had a good plot to keep it going. Halfway through the book though, the novel takes an interesting change in tone with its plot twist. Some of it makes things more interesting and some of it is just plain shocking and heart-wrenching though. Overall, it's a great book and I highly suggest reading it if any of that sounds appealing.<br /><br />WARNING: *Semi-Spoiler* If you are uncomfortable with rape/incest, I may advise staying away from the book.
B00846REIS|5.0|One of the best books I have read in that genre, can't wait for books 2 and 3 to come out
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Fast paced, quick read, macho. This book is part of an extensive series of books using the Jack  Reacher character. I was curious because of the movie starring Tom Cruise. Both the book and the movie lack any depth or plot turns that would make them truly interesting.
B00AE5R2NO|4.0|I have heard over and over again that this doesn't exist, but here it is :)  It's very cute, and my kids love playing with it.  It is sturdy just like the other gups.
B000NVF4FW|5.0|Assume book.  Slow to start but a great story with a positve message.  I'm now reading Atlas Shrugged so will let you know.
0810983915|5.0|A great book for a 9 or 10 year old my daughter and step son share it they both love it
0765325950|5.0|I have read this book since Mr. Jordan started the series 20+ years ago.  I was sad to hear of his passing and worried about how Mr. Sanderson would bring the story forward.  Very happy to say I love this book as much as the first!
1419702238|5.0|Cabin fever seems to be an excellent book for kids. My daughter and step son fight over who is going to read it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I Love the musical, I love the music, I love the cd. I also love how quickly I got it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is totally addictive, the children love it. Only downside is the in app purchasing... Can work out expensive if your child doesn't ask you before downloading £££'s worth of hearts and gems!! Add 3a69f and 26194 for more hearts!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Watching Celebration Day proves that they still got it even after decades apart. A lot more so then other bands from around their era. The saddest part is that it shows that they could and should go back out on tour. Watching this concert on t.v. I would rate to be a better experience than even seeing some bands play live.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for several nieces and nephews (teenagers)<br />and they're all having a blast! I got one for my hubbie and my 15 year old son, WOW. We all feel addicted. I'm at number 35 out of 125! Careful! This is addictive! Great to have in any household!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This app works for me.  I use it to play all of my videos on my Kindle Fire HD and it works very well.  It is a very versatile video player.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|I just love this series! Don't quite understand the ending and the sequel afterwards but I am a huge lover of the Resident Evil series nevertheless.
0765325950|1.0|Like the rest I'm throwing myself in with a one star review. I've been reading this series for almost 22 years now. I first owned the paperbacks (which were trash by the way, the covers were horrible), then I had the full set of hardbacks autographed by Robert Jordan (now in storage for YEARS), finally I bought again in kindle format. I don't want to go back to hardback, and having bought the series 3 times, the publishers can suck it up and sell me the book in the format I want.<br /><br />Okay Sam, Mr. Review police agent, you can come flag my review now.

0061906220|5.0|I borrow 40-50 books per month from my fabulous library, Columbus Metropolitan Library, a national award winning library.  Pete the Cat is so very popular, there is usually a waiting list, and my pre-K class LOVES it!  A generous preschool family gave the teachers a classroom gift this Christmas, and our first choice to spend it on was Pete the Cat for our own library, so the children can freely access their favorite book.  I have often observed small groups of friends sitting on the library sofa, just rollicking along and singing Pete's song!  This is one of their first read-alone experiences., and how rewarding it is!  They also loved Pete the Cat Saves Christmas, and I checked out on YouTube how to sing the refrain, and they sang it with GREAT gusto!  The book lovingly imparts the message I was trying to emphasize this season:  giving.
B005LAII80|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the entire series, from the comic books all the way through both movies. This movie is a MUST BUY. Ill put it this way. If you enjoyed the certain darkness and realism Christopher Nolan created with his versions of Batman, you will love this. The mid 90's Batman and Dredd movies were a little fantasized and unreal. Like the newer batman movies, Dredd brings a certain darkness and realistic feel to the environment you're submerged into. Amazing action, and Karl Urban nailed it as Dredd
0765325950|1.0|I am sure those at TOR really do not care what their customers want because they expect us to by the book anyway. Still I wanted to voice my displeasure and while yes I will by the Kindle version when this book comes out, I will be less likely to look at other books by TOR in the future for the way they handled this release because they will handle other releases the same way. I call on others to do the same. Go ahead and buy this book but make TOR feel it by limiting your purchases from them on future books and series.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|This movie really keeps you on your toes and interested. If you don't pay attention you will miss quite a few things and yo may have to watch the movie again to catch them. The ending was quite interesting albeit a little far fetched. All-in-all I really enjoyed it.
B007K8ILTW|5.0|Got it for my husband and he really liked it.  Order arrived in a very timely fashion. I would recommend your service.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|We watched the rock of Ages movie one night and my wife loved the music in the movie so I got her this CD. It has the people in the movie singing the songs not the orginal singers.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Awesome read. Makes you think.<br />Suicide issues of the heart. Easy read but well written. Could be true to life.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Lots of life lessons. Wonderful voice as dog speaks. Got  predictable but overall, a well told tale. All dogs are wiser than we realize.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|One of the main reasons I purchased the soundtrack was for the song &#34;Give Into Me&#34;.  I expected it to be sung like in the movie... by Leighton Meester and Garrett Hedlund.  Very disappointed that it is not.  Faith Hill sings it on the CD and she has a phenomenal voice but not what I wanted.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Too long. Too many unnecessary characters that did not move the plot along. Also, the mechanism for time travel was unclear.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I could not put it down and read it in less than 6 hours.  I had to know what was coming next.  Colleen Hoover did an amazing job intertwining these characters. This book is a great example of how things from childhood, even though we don't remember them, stick with us. The sky and stars always stuck with Sky. Thanks to Dean, a childhood friend who gave her hope, she never forgot the peace she felt when looking at them.  I was always riveted by Holder's patience with Sky and the maturity he showed throughout the relationship.  There were times, obviously, when he was overwhelmed and would back away. However, when looking at the story from beginning to end, you understand why.  I felt for Sky throughout this novel.  I could totally empathize with her which is an important part of being engaged in a book.  Truly great read.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Great movie for Studio Ghibli fans. One of my favorites. It's easy and carefree to watch. There's no underlying political message or anything like that. A nice story and a happy ending. That's what everyone likes, right?
0765325950|5.0|I love this book.....the only thing that would make it better is another 1000 pages.  These 1-star reviews based on ebook availability are a blow to the hard work Jordan, Sanderson, and Harriet put forth.  Jordan's memory and legacy were honored with this book......apparently these \\"fans\\" would rather muck things up.......pitiful.......truly.  If this was about greed, the ebook would be available right now.  Old-fashioned?  Maybe.  Tor doesn't know their fan base?  Perhaps that's the case, but you 1-star givers clearly are NOT part of the fan base....so uhh, stop pretending you are.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Bought this one for my family in Idaho. It's a holiday tradition that when I'm visiting them, we all watch it together and recite movie lines from it during dinner. Always great fun and HILARIOUS.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Great band fantastic DVD and sound quality! Rush 2112 comic was a lot of fun as well.Hubby loved it for Christmas gift!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim without any expectations. Boy was I blown away by this story of coincidence. Never would have guessed the twist in this story. It was heartbreaking. I was so pissed for Sky and her situation because it really is some sick people out here...what is love without trust.....nothing
B002WY65VU|5.0|Woody is the man and I like him in just about all of his films. My girlfriend typically does not like any graphic killing films, but we both really enjoyed this movie. The director's approach to the topic is hilarious and Jesse Eisenberg and Woody are great on the screen together. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys zombie films or is looking for a good laugh.
B00001U0DP|5.0|The product was in great shape. It got here in great time. It has been viewed several times and there have been no problems. Had I known what an exceptional film this was I would have purchased it long ago. It is a &#34;must see!&#34;
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I love the size of this 7447. Somtimes you only need a few bricketts for a short cook, will this fills the bill. When you use the Minion method of staring a fire this little guy work just right. Fill it up, light it, when it' ready dump in the hole in the middle of your charcole.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game and the story, however it was too short for the price. looking forward to see the sequel of this
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will warm your heart and soul! You will laugh and cry and sometimes all at the same time! This is one of those books that should be on your \\"must read\\" list.
1423140591|5.0|This book is a great mythical book that would be loved by anyone who loves adventure or mythology.  Rick Riordan's way of writing really brings out the experiences and suspense in these books. So if you are a teenager or just anyone who is into adventure or a little bit of history. Why don't you go out and read this book.
0307272702|5.0|Gary Taubes lays it all out here and does so in a very approachable manner.<br /><br />This book is aimmed more at the general public than his first one on that subject and this change is much appreciated.  For folks not familiar with his premise - basically, that carbohydrates are bad - this book goes into excellent depth of how and why the carbohydrate rich diet we're on is doing us such harm.<br /><br />After reading this book you should have a solid understanding of why too many carbs in your diet is a bad thing and be well primed for making the right changes.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of this book is that it doesn't go into much depth as to the specifics - i.e. detailed menus - of what those right changes are.<br /><br />But that's a mild criticism and the main point of this book is to get people to understand why carbs are so bad for us.  In that, it succeeds handsomely.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book and recommend it highly to others.
0765325950|5.0|I just wanted to say the book is great and I'm glad Brandon finished the series.  It's sad it's gotten so many bad reviews from a lack of an e version  People should not review the book unless they read it  They should complain to the publisher though there should be an e version available on release day.  It is 2013 after all.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|First one was better. Worth watching if you've seen everything else on amazon. Way too unrealistic. They could've done a better job with the storyline.
B00122G00Y|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!<br />This has got to me one of my favourite albums by The Arctic Monkeys<br />They even have me spelling the word &#34;favourite&#34; that way!!!<br />Its such a great album.<br />Real dark and epic!!!<br />If you like Indie Music, you definitely have to buy this CD and listen to Indie's Dark Side.<br />=]
B000002V07|5.0|Every time I was with my girlfriend, I suddenly heard this really calm and soothing, romantic music. I wasn't quite sure what it was, but it was really nice and I used to just grab her and slow dance with her because that's what the music made me feel like doing. After some time on the internet, I found that this soothing &#34;slow dance music&#34; was in fact Mazzy Star's So Tonight That I Might See album. I immediately knew that I had to have it. I gave it to my girlfriend and she loved it. She actually confessed that she heard the exact same music on repeat in her head as well. Now we listen to it in the car, in the bedroom with candles, while taking a bubble bath together (with candles), on roller coasters (with candles), and while baking our favorite sweets (cookies).<br /><br />This is simply a MUST HAVE CD. Every track is great and I really recommend it.<br />I received it in a timely manner and it was in mint condition.<br /><br />You should buy this since it's very reasonably priced
B003JTHXOK|5.0|5 star.<br />GREAT BOOK AND HARD TO PUT DOWN.  Domestic violence, alcoholism, and mental illness pretty accurately written. Researched subject well.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Quite simply excellent.  Comfortable, sound is good (a bit light in the bass range).  Cord is rather short -- about 3 feet.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This seller carries a varied catalog of CDs and DVDs that will enable the buyer to enjoy the shopping experience of finding those treasures from classic to current merchandise when adding to their libraries. I will continue to look for this seller when making future purchases in these categories.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I like the story liine the dancing  was fabulous. Made me feel like dancing. Very talented young  people. Loved the last dance sequence the most.
B000002IR7|5.0|Anyone who is looking for the true 60s Memphis sound should grab this CD as soon as possible. They don't come any bigger or better than this group. Great selections from this seller, and will continue to seek future purchases from them.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Loved the kids singing. Acting was abit bad. Probably would not encourage others to see it. More like a high school theme
B0062A5RUA|5.0|one of the best live album i have ever heard!!! Slash and Myles did an amazing job! Myles did better than Axl
6305128952|5.0|Loved the storyline. Love the country they filmed in Beautiful. This is a timeless film  could be from any time. A girls love of horses getting over an aweful event. A love triangle.Hard choises to do the right thing.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This was a great, compelling read. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next the entire time. I highly recommend it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Very futuristic. I dont like it when everyone is shooting at you and you get missed and they get hit. Make a smarter get away plot.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have loved Nelson DeMille's books for years and read them all.  This was very good and well worth reading.  However, I did find John Corey's constant (and I mean constant) glibness somewhat distracting.  I know he's a funny guy, but he came over as extremely arrogant and always making jokes at someone else's expense.  Since the whole premise of the book is so serious, I think so much humor was a little offputting.  But still very good and I'm still a Nelson DeMille fan.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Super humans are not really my thing. I dont like the drug induced super human thing. Acting was so so.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Wow,this band got five stars all over.They came out of nowhere and are a breathe of fresh air. This album is very catchy and addictive. I am very impressed, I listen to a lot of metal and some rap but this right now is at the top of my playlist.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I loved this CD.  It really makes classical music modern and fun.  These guys are so talented.  They take modern fun songs and make them even better.  Even my kids love this CD.  Very different arrangements and fun for the whole family.
B0076DELIG|5.0|For those who love Connelly, he has produced yet another twist and turn materpiece with ever famous Harry Bosch..keeps yu on the edge the entire time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again sparks shows why he is my favorite. Completely loved the way this story was written it will be a reread!
B006LSZECO|2.0|the scattered writing style depicting the life of the husband makes it.too difficult a story line to follow...not interesting.or captivating
B002M9WW30|5.0|the price of 20 dollars, and content buenisimo thanks amazon<br /><br />I get everything in perfect condition but would have preferred the more solid box (it seemed too thin to be a product of collection on ROCKY), however the price was hard to pass up
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is kind of fun, but I wish the pieces were a little bit better quality, given all the cool toys they make now with recycled plastic.  Wish they had more weight or something.  My daughter loves it regardless.  Shipped quickly.  Smooth transaction.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|the price of 10 dollars, and the content very well, thanks amazon<br /><br />I get everything in perfect condition but the box would have preferred a little bit more solid, however the price was very good
B005K17RU0|5.0|I absolutely love this weather app on my Kindle Fire!  Not only does it show all current stats, but it also has an (up to) 10 day forecast that has proven very reliable. Additionally, it has the looping radar as well. This is an awesome app for weather junkies like me!
B008KE3960|3.0|A little basic, but you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.  I don't think I'll be playing it much; I rather spend the time playing Angry Birds.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|What a slog it was to get through this. It was just a live action version of The Family Guy, and I like that show. Not very funny. Expected more from Seth.
B005HSL626|3.0|I got it for free, so I can't complain too much about it.  It's OK to pass the time away, but not too challenging.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|It will definitely make you think.<br /><br />What is out there? How do the gods become gods??<br /><br />In my mind there is but one God. The rest, are tales that have come from life experiences. That's just my experience though.
0307887448|3.0|This book was way too cool in an 80s geek fandom way. I felt pandered to. I don't like to feel pandered to. It was disturbing to have conscious thoughts, while still immersed in the story, about how I'm the intended audience, and doesn't that make me special?! From They might Be Giants to Pac Man, my youth was all there.<br /><br />Fortunately, once I waded through all the name-dropping, a genuine story shone through. There was a lot to love in this book. I loved the main character. I love that he goes up against a corporation and wins (this isn't a spoiler because the protag tells us at the start that he won, and then he relates the story of how he accomplished this feat). I love the political commentary--ha ha, such as government elections being meaningless compared to truly important corporate elections. I love who the protag's online best friend turns out to be. I love the romance.<br /><br />If a worthwhile editor had thought to cut out some of the sludge, this book might have merited 4 or 5 stars. Wait, but then the intended audience wouldn't have known who they are! I might not have related to Wade (main character) as he plays Pac Man through to the end if I hadn't (almost) done this once at a slumber party! I might not be able to live vicariously through a cool future geek (who succeeded where I failed)! Uh, head smack.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. ALexander's story is not only remarkable but causes one to stop and remember this physical life if not permanent. His status as a nerosurgeon makes his recounting of his NDE quite credible. Such a miracle this man is alive and was able to regain his cognitive abilities to give us a wonderful and inspiring recounting of his experience. Thank you, Dr. Alexander
B008G12ERC|3.0|it's a little frenetic at times. The musical sounds are also very diverse. This is not bad, exactly. A band that won't experiment will die of its own lethargy. The problem, of course, is that I don't happen to like all the sounds on this album (especially the more frenetic ones).
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Good book, enjoyed the jesting between characters. Good writer, looking forward to reading next book. Going to look into the other works by this writer.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story covers an area of the historical South that was unknown to me, about an indentured (Irish) servant living with the Black slaves. The author made us care about all of the characters: from those living in the Big House to those in the slsve quarters. Well- written, and a fast read.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|A must have for Stones fans. The 2 new songs fit in nicely with all the classics. It is rocking!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Don't watch this movie if you are expecting lots of laughs (al la [[ASIN:B00466HN7M Bridesmaids]]).  The best gags were in the trailer.  It really is like an hour of Glee ([[ASIN:B003M6DJF2 Pilot - Director's Cut [HD]]]), but with fewer laughs and lots of characters that you really don't care about.<br /><br />If you love song and dance, this might be for you.  But for the rest of us that were led to believe it was a comedy with some singing, only to find out it's singing with a teeny tiny bit of comedy, we're disappointed.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Excellent! A must buy for any Graham Parker fans. Also if you're a fan of Elvis Costello or Joe Jackson
B008M36ER0|3.0|The entertainment was really in seeing the portrayal of the prisons in Mexico.  Am told that much of what was depicted is accurate.  If you're a Mel Gibson fan and are thinking of watching this movie, try a different Mel Gibson flick!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It is a good game.  The only bad thing is that it is always freezing up.  I'm not sure if it is the game or my tablet?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well done with an actual plot. Cant wait until mid season resumes.  Not for the squeamish.  It seems no cast member is safe.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is one of my favorite shows. It's interesting, exciting, and always keeps my attention! Eight years and going strong!
0765325950|5.0|This book was an amazing giant action packed ending to the series. I began this series in the mid 1990s so it was a bittersweet read. Bravo Brandon Sanderson and Team Jordan.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of hidden objects/adventure games, but this one was good enough to make a convert out of me!  Visually rich-looking and driven with a paranormal theme including humorous undertones, &quot;Agency&quot; plays with a satisfying moderate level of difficulty, not too easy but allowing the player to advance reasonably.  You can play it in an untimed mode, use zoom, and there's even a hints button.  I was fortunate to acquire this as a free app of the day, but it's worth the asking price!
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I hate Twilight and True Blood started off good but now it's started to jump the shark.  I was shocked that this is actually good, assuming you can get best the teen soap opera and barrage of emo music.  It's almost the exact story of Twilight, even season 2 (just like the second twilight) introduces werewolves.  Boone (Lost reference) is easily the best character and carries the show.  Each season is better than the last.  My favorite episode from this season is Homecoming, it has a great ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. It made me feel like I was right there with them. I would recommend this book to everyone!!!
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Castle is a great character and the show is well done.  Each season is an improvement over the last.  I personally don't watch a lot of procedural shows.  I used to but I don't have the time for the criminal or monster (in Grimms case) of the week.  I switched to this show when I quit watching Criminal Minds & Hawaii 5-O.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|It took up too much space and was too hard and I got frustrated so I deleted it a few days later
B008OIQYTG|4.0|I own about 95% of Lee Ritenour's music. I've seen him play a few times and he is always on the cutting edge, moving forward and collaborating outside is conform zones. This CD is different because he is that kind of Guitar player, writer and producer. I recommend Rhythm Sessions.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book engulfed me and my emotions. This was an A +<br />For Jodi, it tragically tugs at your heart.
B000003BDI|5.0|Bought this vinyl for my gf for christmas and her new record player.<br />It was perfect. Came in on time. Good condition with vintage insert and everything.<br />I was very pleased and so was she. Rolling Stones, the greatest!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I have to read at least 40min a day for my homework and it could get boring. I chose the Percy Jackson series and my reading assignment became fun!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|If you like Holmes... this one is fairly neurotic as a recovering addict.  He's more fidgety than my Holmes would be, but the stories have been interesting so far.  I keep trying to make Aidan Quinn Anthony's son... still working on that one.  There's a bit of an arc in the stories so if you are starting, watch them in order.
0446554995|2.0|I first off have to say how much I enjoyed Riptide, The Ice Limit, and Mount Dragon. All excellent books. And I liked Reliquary and Relic okay. And that right there I think illustrates the differences in opinions on this book.<br /><br />I propose considering three broad groups of people when researching if you want to read this book:<br /><br />1) I think if you really enjoyed those first three (non-Pendergast) books I mentioned above you likely will NOT enjoy Two Graves. There really is no action in this book like those earlier adventures, nothing more than a fairly standard detective book here.<br /><br />2) If you enjoyed the earlier Pendergast books like Relic and Reliquary then you MIGHT like Two Graves. I say only might because as some reviewers mentioned the authors really went to extremes with Pendergast on this one. As usual he is the superhero with unwavering nerve and unbeatable skill, but he goes from pages and pages of suicidal thoughts to perfect aim with a rifle after jumping off a marathon motorcycle ride in the desert after days of losing blood and not eating. Wearing impeccable suits that somehow hide sample vials, flashlights, and guns. Carte blanche run of the FBI and unlimited financial resources. It's just too much for some readers. And that side story of the Pendergast wannabe helping prove her father's innocence - I personally felt that dialogue was like something from Scooby Doo, not at all how I think real people would actually talk.<br /><br />3) If you are a diehard Pendergast reader then you likely will enjoy Two Graves. It just depends on your intent for reading, the level of escapism you want and can enjoy.<br /><br />As for what some felt was a tired plot of Nazi supermen, you would know this before buying by reading these reviews so just be prepared for what you get. I will agree that there isn't anything too earth shattering in this book, not like the ending of Ice Limit or Riptide for example.<br /><br />I respect these authors very much, but I just think this book requires a slightly narrower audience to appreciate this book.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|If you're ready to move beyond the ubiquitous depictions of charts and graphs, and mindless presentations during which you insult your audience by reading the text printed on the slide, this book will teach you how to design and present a slideshow for grown-ups.  Not just a sophisticated slideshow, but one with real impact.<br /><br />I have 7 pages of notes from this book, all written by hand because I want to own them.  Although I've read a ton of good books in my day, there have been only a few which I've done more than highlighted.<br /><br />If Zen strikes you as too esoteric, just forget about it.  This book contains a load of hard-core practical advice, along with some relevant philosophical gems that you'll find equally helpful and pertinent.<br /><br />BTW, I had a little glitch with the Kindle edition and I contacted the author.  He went far beyond the call of duty to ensure my satisfaction.  This is a person who walks his talk.  You won't go wrong by taking his advice.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I purchased the soundtrack prior to seeing the movie since Amazon had a deal for $5.  However, even at $5, I would not have purchased the soundtrack if I had seen the movie first.<br /><br />My impression in listening to the soundtrack was the same as when I saw the movie: a bit disappointing.  The overall singing (and voices) were just not up to the standards of the performances of &#34;Les Miserables&#34; that have come before.  After all, it is first a musical and second a movie.  They would have been better off using a studio version of the songs.  Other shows, like &#34;Hair&#34;, &#34;Jesus Christ Superstar&#34;, &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; and &#34;Rent&#34;, stayed true to the music.  For these other shows, I have both the theatrical and movie versions of the soundtracks and listen to both.  I won't be listening to this soundtrack any longer: I will only listen to the theatrical versions.<br /><br />Having said that, I find that the second half is a lot better than the first; a lot better voices (and singers).  Hugh Jackman was OK but not that good.  As the lead, he should have been at least &#34;good&#34;.  And it goes without saying that Russell Crowe was very disappointing as Javert.  The song &#34;Stars&#34; was the acid test and he failed.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|We came late to the party on \\"Castle,\\" and just finished Season 2.  We love it!  We like the characters, both who they are and how they develop, and the supporting characters are just as interesting as the main ones.  The whole show takes a more lighthearted approach to a normally dark subject, which is refreshing next to all the intensely gritty dramas out there.  There's a great balance of humor, action, and drama that keeps us watching.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I've owned great Marware cases in the past but after reading the reviews here I very nearly skipped ordering this case. As it turns out I had nothing to worry about and this is a great product.<br /><br />Most times I just leave the Kindle rotated 180 degrees so that I can open it like a book and have the power button on top, camera on the left. With the Kindle in this position, everything that I've seen someone complain about is a non-issue:<br /><br />-The charging port is accessible with the case closed.<br />-The auto on/off works just fine.<br />-I haven't had any trouble rotating the device to put it into one of its standing positions.<br />-When I have the cover folded back, the case strap holds the case together on the right, while my left hand is exactly in the right spot to keep the device from &#34;flapping&#34; (though I can understand the desire to have a snap or latch to secure it instead).<br /><br />It's pricey, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but so far it's been worth the gamble.
B006CUZ7FA|5.0|I love Harry Potter Movies and Books!<br />I hear there may be more coming?<br />Six more words to go before it will let me submit this...
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Well at least they got the sound right. The film is even more engaging when you feel that with the 7.1 surround<br />Sound you were in with the action. Even better when you view it on a 100&#34; screen. I am  a video and audio enthusiast so i dont reckon you can get the whole ambience with any film until you have the right hardware to do the job. The action and fast paced aspects were first class even though the story and plot can be a tad confusing and difficult to follow. To me, it's a film you have to watch many times to experience the nuances. But a fab addition to my repertoire.
B009193OCM|2.0|I'm a Lonely Planet fan. I have bought many guides, bur this kindle version is like a pdf with hiperlinks. It's not user friendly, not attractive and I didn't use it at all. Next time I'll still buy the LP guide, but not the ebook version.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|How do you make a movie about bicycles entertaining and thrilling? The answer is Premium Rush.  I originally thought this would be along the lines of Quicksilver but what a difference 26 years makes.  Incredible footage of bicycles messengers screaming through the streets of New York.  Love the way the choices we presented to Wilee when he had to make a critical traffic decision.  The stunts are awesome. The plot captivating till the very end.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Totally worth the investment to have the complete set, came beautifully packaged and was AMAZING to watch. Really enjoyed it and thought the value made it a steal!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I had been waiting to see this movie for a while and it did not disappoint. Actions and intrigue from begining to end.  interesting characters and plot had me sitting on the edge of my seat for every second of this movie.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|TERRIBLE I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND FOR A SINGLE LIVING OR EVEN DEAD SOUL TO BUY THIS APP. IT'S S*** AND A HUUUUUUUUUUGE WASTE OF MONEY.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|My wife wanted to see this and so we did and it was surprisingly entertaining. Lots of bullets and stuff blowed up made for exceptional action entertainment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book!  I love how everything ties together, I couldn't put it down.  I will read the rest of Colleen Hoover's books!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I had not planned on seeing this movie since I am really a die hard Jason Bourne fan.  But although this movie had a slow start it accelerated into the action expected from this movie series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book  is amazing at first it was a little bleeding burn them I feel in love I couldn't put it down and  now that it's  over its so  said almost  cried at the  end because  I want it so work out with the two of them
B009K0P10K|5.0|I bought this episode because I couldn't seem to access it any other way.  It was worth it.  Very quick to load, and great high def picture.
B004T4KQJS|2.0|Krauss equivocates on the word &#34;nothing.&#34; The basic gist of Krauss's argument is that the relativistic quantum field can have different states kind of like my hand can be flat or it can be balled up in a fist. One possible state of the field is the universe that we know and love. Another possible state of the field is the absence of all matter. It is the latter state which Krauss suggests we may as well call nothing. He understands that it isn't nothing (which he calls the &#34;philosopher's&#34; nothing) and he spends a chapter arguing why his equivocation is justified. His argument to justify his equivocation fails and, hence, Krauss doesn't really inform us how the universe began to exist from nothing. And while it is very interesting to hear how the universe came from SOMETHING (truly it is), it is not nearly as interesting as it would be if he showed how the universe could come to exist uncaused from nothing.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|This app might be fun to play with and make a little noise with, but it does not teach you to play the piano.  It does not translate well to the real thing.  Also, as with the drum app, the noise is delayed.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a grand novel that draws a picture of the world as WWI erupts, women suffrage pushes forward, bolsheviks triumph in Russia and prohibition is doomed for failure.  Follet has created another epic novel that is more than entertainment; more than historical facts; more than a love story; its a masterpiece.  It is lengthy and requires effort but it is a novel that will endure.  It took me weeks to read it but I feel like I had a 7 course gourmet meal from the finest of chef.
B007EC27QM|4.0|This calculator works well for simple calculations (not a scientific calculator).  I use it while grocery shopping, especially when figuring how much 5 of something will cost.
B00APUQKDG|2.0|Just couldn't connect with this movie. Gave up on it halfway thru. Found it disjointed, spacey, more artsy than dramatic. Characters not from my world or any that I am familiar with . You can't watch everything and I couldn't watch this.
B00881VLCE|3.0|As a puzzle, it is ok to pass the time.  I like how you can increase the difficulty by making the pieces smaller.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I really enjoyed this;  I loved the Arnie S, and I loved the differences in this one.  It's a contemporary take on an old fav.<br />If you want a good action movie, just a fun, entertaining one, this is it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My kid really enjoys this game.  I keep it loaded for when I allow him to play with my reader.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|All I can say is that I can't stop listening to it! It's been nearly three months, and it is still as fresh and delightful as the day I received it in pre-order. Like fine wine, it improves over time - you'll find a new groove or riff, or a sly lyric that will make you chuckle with each new listen. Grammy worthy!<br /><br />Donald, I beg of you, please tour this album!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This was a fun new take on the hidden pictures game.  Each level got progressively more difficult than the last.  The items got smaller, and there were more of them to find.  In some cases, I was given the name of an item to find, but I didn't know what that item was.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|Suitable fo both adult and mature teenage readers. A warm and inspiring novel. With hope, courage, sincere friendship and love.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I like this developer of free, traditional board games.  I especially like the two player feature so I can play against my kid, or against the computer.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Hmmm... well, it's good. XD, now I know how to pronounce a few words.Lol I kinda don't get the dictionary... but very good. :)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kid really likes this game.  He gets frustrated at the more complex levels, but he still enjoys the game.
B003ELMR9E|5.0|Own Insomnia on DVD, very happy with the overall improvement in pic quality and extras on thr Bluray disc.<br />highly recommended!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game was enjoyable and challenging.  It was similar to \\"bejeweled\\" with a twist.  I especially liked that it allowed you to continue after you \\"finished\\" the goal.  I have to admit that I didn't play it long after I finished, but most just start over at that point.  I may go back to it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i like it but don't like the commercials in it.  Sometimes I don't see the pictures when I click on it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app every day.  I can write notes, or create a check list.  I like how I can change the color of each note to help organize types of notes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|very easy to use, It's a lot of fun to see what the other people have pinned up and it's a great source of inspiration.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I don't always know if this program is running, but I do know that since I downloaded it, I have not had problems reading documents.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved it, loved it...i did not get a chance to view the tv show...hope ther do a rerun...I watxh my dvd at least once a moth
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games seem too juvenile for my tastes, but my kid likes some (but not all) of the games. I only have the first two groups available at this point, so he might like more of them as we progress.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|this is a beautiful love story,  saw part 2...waitin for it to come out on dvd....how long do you think it will take?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Probably one of the best episodes so far, and the HD played extremely smooth with no lagging. word word requirement.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|It's good to read about history in our time. Fast moving, exciting. These men in this book are Supermen. Read it.
B00003CXSP|2.0|... and if you are into that sort of things, then knock yourself out. If instead you have been blessed with a well balanced psyche, have found this title on Netflix or Prime, and are excited at the idea of spending a night with a movie from Sir Ridley Scott, well, just don't. You are in for two hours of boredom, silliness and distaste. Just try to forget that he directed this one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box (A Harry Bosch Novel)  by Michael Connelly is a fantastic read that you don't want to end.
B0063IH60K|1.0|the game is very fun; but the annoying ads out weigh the fun. the ads pop up frequently and are difficult to clear.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I chose this book because i had read the first book of the trilogy, and I wanted to continue reading the stories of the characters and the history. I always enjoy reading fiction set in actual historical events. Follet does that so well. He is one of my favorite authors. I am eager for the third book of the trilogy.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Beautiful singing from four good-looking men with heaven sent voices. I have enjoyed all of their dvds and cds. Fantastic singing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A757EFW|3.0|We really enjoyed this game. The one thing I didn't or we don't like is, the game only lets you play for a short time,then it stops and tells you can buy the full version. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that...  I hate it when games do that, so start telling everybody..letting us know it won't let you play for as long as you want to.. It is more of a trial game instead of the real Pac-Man game.!! Thank you
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Fantastic singing as usual. I have all of Il Divo's dvds and cds. I really enjoy and love hearing these four talented young men sing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book, it was a good thriller to read on a rainy day. I just don't feel it was that strong. The characters felt flat to me, very one-dimensional. The plot twists were predictable, I almost always knew what 'twist' would come next. I did think it was a fun read, just not a great one.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|good game because it is so much better than bloon td 3 and big step up for ninja kiwi and kindle adition
B0091REZMW|3.0|AT first the app was fun to search for clues to open secret doors and such, but as you get farther into it the difficulty is not worth the time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great read, really quick and easy to get into, only problem was then I couldn't put it down!! Lots of twists to keep it exciting!!!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I love this game. Each time I play I get time extensions to send me to another level. The response on my Kindle Fine is top notch and thats what makes it fun. PS my kids are not as skilled and did not like it so much
B0076DELIG|3.0|Connelly just phoned this one in.  Disappointing. Guess he needed some extra cash.  Hope he's working on another Lincoln Lawyer yarn.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|After assembly, this was a hit for about 5 minutes and my son has not touched it since then. I would not recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was so easy to read and  kept my interest. I just HAD to have the next book--before I finished the one I was reading.
B000002O7C|5.0|Whats more epic than intense orchestra music? Orchestra music with a RUSSIAN CHOIR! Not to mention the music itself is great.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|I would rather have given this 3 1/2 stars.....4 seems like a little too much but 3 seems too little.  If you are a Jim Carrey fan then, of course, rent/purchase this version.  If you've never seen a production of this classic tale...what the heck are you waiting for?!  It provides a VERY important lesson....one I wish the world would remember a little more often!<br /><br />My personal favorite version, however, remains Bill Murray's turn in &#34;Scrooged&#34;.  I'll admit I haven't seen it in awhile but if I'm remembering correctly, it's funnier.  This version (Jim Carrey) has some dark moments (I know, they all do especially when it comes to the Ghost of Christmas Future) so keep this in mind if you have younger viewers.  In fact, for the younger set, I recommend The Muppets Christmas Carol as a better introduction.  Older kids and tweens will probably prefer Disney's a Christmas Carol to the Muppet version however.<br /><br />Please note...I did NOT view this in 3D...I'm sure the effects were cool though.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|i love this prodct! i accidently ordered this but my little boy just loves it n sleeps with it every night
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game totally rocks! Got the free version for my phone and when I saw the 99&cent; version for the kindle fire, I bought it! What a great find! So happy with this, and I am an avid gamer!
B0013ND30M|5.0|got this for my daughter for her birthday and she just absolutely loves sleeping beauty it is one of her favourites
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kid is 8 and love to play this game, of coiurse he has to earn it, but it is a safe and entertaining game for children, I would say about six...
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I've been a fan from the beginning!  Now I need to purchase the rest of the series!  No disappointments here!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Awesome game, my son loves trying to figure out how to get the goo to move to the pipe.  Keeps him busy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story proving even Mitch Rapp is mortal. I liked it. ANother great Vince Flynn novel. Keep'em coming. Enjoyed it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son downloaded this on to my kindle, he is 8 and enjoys playing this game.  The graphics are awesome
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is sarcastic. Its his character. Just seems to me he is getting even more sarcastic to the point of obnoxious. I like the stories but have grown weary of his incessant sarcasm in this book. Story line is excellent and indicative of all Demille's books. Great twist at the end . Didn't see it coming. Mark of a great writer.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Works great in the gym, does not need wifi.  A great little helper for gym or a home workout! Thanks!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Amazing story...no second book? I'm disappointed that we can't find out what happens next. I look forward to seeing a sequel in the future!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing!  I love all the little different kinds of melodies thast a person can choose! A lot of fun to play with and nice to listen to when there is nothing else going on...
B000683VI4|5.0|Great gift idea for a romantic movie the entire family can watch when your family is going through a loss of memories from a close family member facing dementia or Alzheimer's .
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|The concept is wonderful, but I have not been able to play this.  Everytime I try to get on it, it never brings anything up except the loading screen.  I only gave it 3 stars because it was for free...
B002PZC8BM|1.0|I really enjoy the mentalist but the amazon instant video app continues to unexpectedly shut down. The app has a pop up when I reopen that says \\"instant video unexpectedly quit, would you like to send an anonymous report so we can fix the problem?\\" I've already sent over 10 anonymous reports but I really would like to watch the show I purchased from amazon. Additionally, the app will not interface with Apple TV, maligning it so I cannot watch the show on my tv when I am home.
B005LAII08|4.0|Love this movie and the animation in HD is amazing.  The only issue for us is that there is 1 scene the 5 year old is too scared to watch but we just fast forward through it now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is one of my favorite ways to pass time. Game play is quick, and easily figured out. If you enjoy Solitaire, then this is a good one to get.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I think this book was great! I've seen  the movie before and this book is so much different. Effective writing techniques really kept me reading this fantastic novel. Awesome!
B006OT03BM|5.0|When I first read the headlines I knew this was one I couldn't pass up! Once I received it, it was everything I expected. The only downfall i seen was the outer casing seemed cheesy and instead of real metal it was made of cardboard with print to make it look like metal. But still worth getting especially for the film cells plaque!
0316227706|5.0|I've seen his work floating around online before, so when I heard his collection was available in a book, I jumped on the deal.  Bought another copy for my parents (dog lovers) and they got a kick out of it.
0062200909|4.0|This book held up to it's expectations and presented in depth pictures and details on various production and concepts. Especially loved the attention on Radagast the Brown and the Wargs. Bag End received great coverage as well. If you're into the concepts and art from The Hobbit then this book is the way to go.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Best book EVER!! Amazing ! Just amazing. It Wabash creepy and suspenseful! Everyone should read it. Now on to the 2nd book.
B009O07NDY|5.0|When I first listened to this I felt a flashback to the Lord of the Rings but the music carries you into the Hobbit. Great compositions and loved the two tracks with the dwarves singing. This soundtrack pulls you into the movie and is a shaker of moods. Well done Howard!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This puzzle game has it all. A fun concept, appealing graphics, and lots of challenging puzzles. I definitely recommend it.
B009K45Y62|4.0|Overall I found this collector's edition very well planned out except for the storage container for the discs. The container itself is nice and has a neat design, but there's no separation between the discs or any distinctive protection except for the outer shell. Basically you just pile/snap them in on eachother which is poor means for maintaining. Otherwise, the Bat cowl statue is the selling point obviously, It was well detailed and loved the cracks and separation points to make it look like it was trully broken by Bane!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This movie is reminiscent of that movie The Raid Redemption, though without the kung-fu.  It's got some ups and downs to it.  The first movie (Judge Dredd) had much better Sci-Fi pushed into the post apocalyptic world. This movie has no flying cars, no food robots, no cyborgs, and no clones or abusive computer AI's to manipulate.  Instead, it's almost like what Detroit would be like in 20 years...ha!  Still, for an action flick, it's not bad.  At least in this one the side-kick female role was played out much better with her killing people and passing judgement.  The first movie it was more \\"look at me, I have boobs.\\" and that's all she was good for.
0785162348|5.0|This book had great flow to it, from the characters to the landscape and weapons. You name it, this book's got it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this. Had a few laughs and a few tears. All in all it was a great book to read. Finished it in 2 days so didn't put it down for very long!
0937381888|5.0|Very good book for brewing.  Read this book before brewing so you get it right the first time.  Explains Why and not just How.  I highly recommend for new brewers.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Probably too old for this.  Singing that we heard was good.  The rest of the movie was pretty dumb.  Turned it off after 20 minutes.<br /><br />Probably missed the good part, but couldn't see keeping it on any further.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This 1st season DVD set is excellent. Great quality and no problems. I still need to get the 2nd and soon the 3rd season also! Best show on AMC and TV for that matter! I think it's well worth the money just to watch the shows when and how I want with frame by frame action and no commercial interruption!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this free app for my Kindle Fire.  I's graphical display is easy to read and all features are intuitively obvious.  I use it almost every time I turn on the Kindle to see how much battery life is left and whether I should recharge it soon.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|If your a twilight fan than it's a good buy. my wife and i are fans of the movies so this was a must have like all the rest. its a soundtrack so if you liked the movies it goes without saying you will like the soundtrack.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very nice App.  I use it every time I go to a new location to see what WiFi networks are avalaible.  It provides the signal strangth and some indication of its operating band.  It would be nice to know whether the networks is OPEN or whether a password is required; but you can only find that out by trying to access it.  Nevertheless it is a very iuseful App and it's free.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is a more amazing story than it is a book. The story is so compelling that I couldn't put it down. You so rarely thing about the enemy being human beings but this book illustrates the career and hard times of the otherside. The book itself is certainly above average, but I'm a better person for knowing the story.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Well the subject says it all; and I have 4 other news apps for my Kindle Fire and they simply don't compare to this one.  The presentation is very clean and easy to see.  You can chose from a large number of categories which news to diisplay.  The organization of the items is great and updates are done frequently.  And the news is presnted factually (most of the time) without the political bias presented by almost all of the US based news companies.  The only drawback is that it only works in the &#34;potrait&#34; mode and does not change to &#34;landscape&#34; when to Kindle is turned.  That's not really objectionable to me since the presnetation is best viewd in portrait mode;  if landscape were available, I'd most likely not use it.,
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and he was estatic! He loved it very much and would highly reccomend the purchase.
0765325950|1.0|This is of course another 1 star review because of the delayed release of the ebook. I would just like to remind people that all the blame for that delayed releases is on Tor book's shoulders, not Amazon's and show once more why the fall of the major publishing houses is something to welcome and actively work for. Please boycott any Tor book paper releases that do not have an ebook release on the same day. Please vote with me for their death be refusing to play into their money games and get the book somewhere else, be it in a library or \\"otherwise\\".
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is my first experience with Mr. Howey's work read via recommendation from a trusted friend. <br /><br />I'm not, per se, a great fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, although Wind-Up Girl was fantastic. So I approached this story with a hint of trepidation. <br /><br />In short, it was excellent. <br /><br />The setting is extremely well-drawn, details fed to the reader carefully and meaningfully over time.<br /><br />The story is complex and involves different points of view, micro and macro influences, short and long-term histories.<br /><br />The cast is vast, varied, deep and fully-developed.<br /><br />And I guarantee you don't know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I will say that reading this as five separate stories would be deeply frustrating, as the so-called endings of each section are not so much cliff-hanger as cliff, not to mention they are way too short individually to be satisfying. The way this needs to be read is right here, as one great novel.

0765325950|1.0|I do not purchase paper books anymore. What's with the book released in 2013 not having an electronic version? It is a note to all publishers to get with the program and always release in electronic format first.
0765325950|1.0|This is directed at Harriet Jordan - this is not 1990 anymore, we're in the modern era.  Your final attempt at greed is really sad given the sweeping faux-grandeur of the series.  Now I have to wait 3-4 months until it shows up on Pirate Bay instead of you taking my money right now?  Blood and ashes!<br /><br />As for the book itself, throughout the series I've thoroughly enjoyed skipping any page in which I glimpsed the words \\"Aes Sedai\\". Ie, if I saw those godawful wenches on a page, that page was not read. This made several of the more awful books (5-10) very light reads, which was great given the utter lack of content.<br /><br />This is a fitting end to a series that started well and quickly dissolved into a sticky, sugary, politically correct train wreck of 17,000 characters doing nothing but tugging braids, sniffing and whining about \\"wool headed men.\\"<br /><br />Enoy your one star review.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|Brilliant read, subtle, great prose, captivating, current and I am so glad I took the time to read the book instead of just waiting for the movie. Time well spent
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Love this cast and this concert!  I love the applause as I have never been to a live production and this make me feel like I am there!  Highly recommend!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This book has been on my to-read list for ages. It sounded like such an interesting novel and I've stumbled upon so many quotes I've liked from the novel. After seeing the visually stunning movie previews, I put my name on the library waiting list and vowed the read the book before seeing the movie.<br /><br />While reading, I had no idea how I felt about the book, but I hoped that would change as I got further and further along. Unfortunately, I'm done and I still don't really know how I feel about it, hence the 3 star rating. The best way to for me to organize my thoughts in cases like these is to go over what I liked and what I didn't like.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: The author is an amazing writer and one with a wide range of talent considering the various voices he was able to write from. Each short story fully immerses itself in its own time through the narrator's language. In the two futuristic stories, the author was able to make up his own words, creating a new language to write from and yet it made sense to me as the reader. I cannot deny this it is an incredible talent to master the language of each time period.<br /><br />The layout of the book was also quite brilliant. The first 5 stories end abruptly in the middle. The 6th story is told in full, and the remaining halves of the 5 are told in reverse chronological story. The main characters in each story find something from the story before, for example, in the second story, the character finds the journal of the narrator of the first story. Each story follows a similar path and I feel like the characters all had some sort of epiphany at the end of their stories and all of the stories are linked in some way.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story of Sonmi. As a stand alone short story, I would give it 5 stars and then some. I felt like I connected with the character and I felt out of all the other narrators, she told her story the best.<br /><br />Each story has an important revelation of human nature. I've highlighted a handful of quotes from each story that spoke to me on that level. Questions of greed and selfishness and cruelty and power are all there in each story. I can appreciate a novel that tries to tackle what it means to be human and I liked some of the points Cloud Atlas made.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book: While all of the stories are linked in some way and share some parallels, I still can't help but feel like their connections are weak. The connections are brilliant, especially when it comes to the repeating themes in each story, but I can't help but feel like the very fact that this is a novel and not 6 separate short stories is a way of showing off the author's ability to write such distinctly different stories. It guarantees that we all search for the connections and are exposed to his different styles of writing and I just feel like it's pretentious. I hate to say that, but it's just the way I felt while reading it and I couldn't shake the feeling.<br /><br />While I was more interesting in some stories over others, which I think was due mainly to my normal preferences, I felt like I didn't really care about most of the stories or the characters in them. Even though I now know the overall theme and picture, I still can't bring myself to say that I felt anything more than curiosity reading most of the stories. I wanted so badly to connect and to care about the characters, but I just didn't. It was like I knew I was reading a good book and it was interesting, but I also wasn't loving it and turning the pages eagerly. I just remained distantly curious.<br /><br />The book was almost written too well and the writing overpowered the story. The book ceased to be profound because I was reading with one eyebrow raised, waiting to see what else the author would flash in front of me. I frequently talk about how I dislike when authors tell me instead of showing me something in a book, but I may have to amend how I word that to: Show, don't just tell, but don't show off!<br /><br />Overall, this was a brilliant book and I see why so many other people love it. Unfortunately, I wanted to love this book and I didn't. I will recommend this book to others because I think other people will appreciate the story more than I did. Writing gimmicks sometimes work for me and other times they backfire and this is one of those books that backfired for me. I still plan on seeing the movie because it looks amazing and I know it's done a bit differently. I think a lot of what I didn't enjoy was the writing, even though the writing was brilliant, if that makes any sense at all. I suspect I will truly enjoy the movie, as it will be stripped of the writing style that rubbed me the wrong way.

To me, basically, it is a love story between two people, one of whom has been thoroughly traumatized in childhood, and the woman he meets who is trying to save him with her love and determination.

B0002V7O3I|3.0|I remember seeing a tape of this movie once when I was a kid, although even back then I seemed to have a pretty good grasp of what the movie did right and what it did wrong. As an adult revisiting it, I can see with a lot more clarity how this movie started out with great potential, but unfortunately it suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in the third act that stops the movie from being the classic that it could have been.<br /><br />The first two acts of the movie are great. We are introduced to a strong cast of A-list child actors who all deliver great performances-- no doubt due to the direction by Joe Dante, who directed Gremlins (which, unsurprisingly, was executive produced by Steven Spielberg). If you are familiar movies like Close Encounters, E.T., or the more recent Super 8, and even The Goonies, this movie will immediately have a familiar sense of charm. The story of some innocently mischievous kids getting into a bit of trouble so that they can build their own spaceship is something just about any kid can identify with, and the way the movie approaches the ends up being strangely plausible. The kids are memorable characters, and seeing the journey that takes them from happening upon a crazy, mysterious idea to flying their own spacecraft is one that will capture the imagination of both the young and old.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the destination is not nearly as satisfying as the journey. When the kids get into space and finally make first contact, the thoughtful \\"Spielbergian\\" wonder disappears quickly, and is replaced with an obnoxious saturday morning cartoon. The aliens themselves look like leftovers from a Ren and Stimpy cartoon, and they are about as tactfully written. The rest of the movie did such an admirable job of taking itself seriously that when our protagonists come face to face with pop-culture spouting Nickelodeon rejects, the movie falls apart.<br /><br />I will always remember this movie as a mixed bag, and a missed opportunity. You get 2/3 of a great movie, and the last 1/3 of a crappy one. The first two acts of the movie definitely at least make it worth checking out, but the fact that the movie started off so strong only to rapidly devolve into cartoonish antics keeps it from being a must-see. I almost wish I had just stopped the tape when the kids made it into space, and left the mystery of the aliens as just that so I could better enjoy the rest of the movie for what it was.get 2/3 of a great movie, and the last 1/3 of a crappy one.

B006964E8S|4.0|I read The Forgotten before this one and realised I didn't have the &#34;thread&#34; of some of the story so went back to this one. I like Baldacci so there is an element of bias but I personally found it a gripping read. I can't help making a comparison however with Jack Reacher. Very similar characters which in some ways is a shame.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact is a story that centers around Chris and Emily, two kids who grew up together and whose futures were linked from birth. Their parents were convinced they would get married before the kids were even teenagers, and as high school students, they seemed to be fulfilling the prophecy. When Emily is found dead and Chris is at the scene, he explains that they had made a suicide pact - she would kill herself, and then Chris would follow - but that he had fainted and botched the plan. He is then arrested and set to go to trial for Emily's murder. Both sets of parents are shocked, and this event tears apart even the best of friends.<br /><br />I am already a huge Jodi Picoult fan, and this book does not disappoint. One of my favorite things that Picoult does is switch points of view so that the reader can get inside the characters' heads. She does that in this book as she explains the history behind all of the characters and the relationships they have built. This really adds to the character development and helps the reader understand each character's reaction to the big event.<br /><br />Picoult uses each point of view to switch between present and past, slowly building to the night of Emily's death and all of the factors that played a part in the event. What I love so much about Picoult is how she can take a situation that I cannot imagine (a botched suicide pact, for example) and make me pause to think about it in a different way. Do I love someone so much that I would watch them die because it pained them to live? And do I love someone so much that I would then kill myself so that I could spend an eternity with them?<br /><br />Picoult has another hit with this beautiful, tragic story, and I definitely recommend her to everyone.

0765325950|1.0|It's not about the price, I'd gladly pay $20-$25 for the last book of a series I've been reading for 15 years. But I don't want to carry a ten pound book around. I already bring my tablet with me to work, and that's my preferred format to read in any case. I'm conflicted between my desire to not buy it at all and just borrow the book from a library to spite the publisher, and my desire to support Sanderson, who I feel has done a fantastic job with an incredibly difficult job. Here's to hoping TOR learns from the feedback and doesn't repeat this mistake in the future.

B00BMKDTNC|1.0|I am still reeling from disappointment. I thought Brandon Sanderson did a great job on &#34;The Gathering Storm&#34; and &#34;Towers of Midnight&#34; but &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; has left me so disappointed, I don't know how to get it out of my head except to write this dumbo review. Basically, the story didn't have cohesion - there was way too much superfluous stuff going on that didn't have to be included, while primary issues that needed to be developed toward a successful build-up were just left blowing in the wind.<br /><br />I'm going to list some stuff I hated so don't read if you don't want to see some massive spoilers. These items are not listed in any order.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />#1 - Lan and Nynaeve had no time together in this book except for a couple of sentences at the very end.<br /><br />#2 - Perrin spends page after page after page in the dreamworld trying to find Slayer and kill him - boring, boring...<br /><br />#3 - The 4 great generals who have oversight of the battle are compromised by compulsion via Graendel. After the buildup of these great men, we see Bryne, Bashere, Ituralde and Agelmar being removed from command and sitting useless. Purely disrespectful way to end the careers of these great men.<br /><br />#4 - The Aiel might just as well have been left out of this book - oh, wait a minute, in my opinion - they were!<br /><br />#5 - The nation of Shara shows up during the last battle - did we really need one more element added to the already bursting balloon of confusion going on? This one was ridiculous. They were not a well known people. If the author needed some other people to battle besides the boring Trollocs, why not send in the Shaido? But then again, the &#34;good&#34; Aiel might have had to actually have a role to play in the book.<br /><br />#6 - Why in the world did we need to kill off Gareth and Siuan and Egwene and Gawyn?<br /><br />#7 - Leilwin or Egeanin - whatever you prefer was so superfluous that I can't believe she was even included in the book. Plus, her character had always been portrayed as being so strong - Sanderson turned her into a wimpy marshmallow in this book.<br /><br />#8 - I thought the Ashaman deserved more than they got - both in support and in details. So much more could have been made of Logain and his leadership - wasted opportunity.<br /><br />I could go on and on. But the biggest issue I had after wading through so many boring pages in my effort to get &#34;somewhere&#34; was the dumb ending. In all fairness to Sanderson, It's my understanding the epilogue was written by Robert Jordan but here goes: Rand leaving in Moridin's body, albeit healthy and with his right mind - thinking of the places he would go and what he would do giving the three women in his life a few final thoughts - wondering if one or all of them might follow them. It was as though they were nothing to him - absolutely nothing! What about your children Elayne is carrying? What about the fact that Aviendha can't walk and may be crippled for the rest of her life, what about Min, your faithful companion and encourager? This to me was the final heartless blow. That our main guy that we had traveled with, loved with, anguished over - some readers for 23 years and all of us for 14 books, could be so blase about the people he purportedly loved?<br /><br />One last item - I did like Mat's character in this book and felt it was portrayed truer than most. Sanderson did provide me with some good laughs. However, Mat should have been leading the battle from the beginning with the other captains working under him. Also, Lan's character remained true to the end - just needed more writing about Lan and Nynaeve together.<br /><br />I just re-read the two books in Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive Series and he is a fantastic author. I can only wonder if he had too much going on and was under too much pressure when he wrote this book.lieve she was even included in the book.

B001DUGOWY|4.0|John Steinbeck's early novels, particularly \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are well known for packing a walloping emotional punch. Over time Steinbeck style and tone evolved. His move from California to Sag Harbor, Long Island probably had as much effect as age, experience and changing times. His last novel, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" shows Steinbeck continues to have strong views on America's social currents and his writing reflects the more subtle corruption of society that he sees around him.<br /><br />As the books are so different that had I not known ahead of time that this was a Steinbeck novel I would not have guessed it. Gone is the heavy use of vernacular and voice of the oppressed underclass unable to catch a break. In its place is Ethan Allen Hawley, the grocery clerk from the 11th generation of a once proud and wealthy family. Hawley is smart, glib, somewhat superficial growing cynical of his increasingly trapped middle age.<br /><br />Steinbeck sees Hawley's small town is perhaps a metaphor of the American society was so worrying to him. Businessmen are double dealing. Elected officials take a little bit on the side. And everywhere is the potential for a little shoplifting or infidelity. Through humor and wit much of this is glossed over but as the portraitures grew deeper it's more apparent that few in Steinbeck's world are capable of doing right. Their moral failings are central to his story.<br /><br />Overall the book was worthwhile, The characters are interesting and original and for social criticism this is ahead of its time. I found Hawley to be a strangely inconsistent character. He quotes latin, sites verse in Old English and in other ways  is presented as potentially a deep and reflective person. But he is unaffected by his war years unnaturally detached from his wife and children using way too much humor. It contradicts with his later motives and actions which ultimately lead to a series of plot resolutions that seem to fall a bit short but I would say these are minor flaws for a story that illuminates its time with originality and freshness that remains for the modern reader.<br /><br />NOTE: Susan Shillinglaw's forward is quite helpful but I'd suggest it as an afterward as the plot giveaways were more than I would have liked.ld say these are minor flaws for a story that illuminates its time with originality and freshness that remains for the modern reader.<br /><br />NOTE: Susan Shillinglaw's forward is quite helpful but I'd suggest it as an afterward as the plot giveaways were more than I would have liked.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|Hitchens wrote a lot of great books on a variety of subjects. In each of his other books, you can feel that a huge deal of research and prior reading was done to bring you each chapter. In Mortality, however, Hitchens speaks his mind more freely. It is pure Hitchens greatness.<br /><br />I loved the last chapter the most. It was basically fragmentary jottings left unfinished at the time of his death. I felt very connected to his great mind as I read the last paragraph which might have been the last thing he wrote.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried harder throughout this book than I ever thought was possible. This is an absolute work of art. The Fault in Our Stars is by far the best book I have ever read, and I feel blessed to have had the opportunity. This book touched me in a way no other book has and I am utterly amazed by its excellence. Bravo John Green. Bravo.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Love this movie! Watched it with my students the last day of school before Christmas break! Good laughs all around and put us in the Christmas mood!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A classic and always good to read at this time of the year! Reading it as Charles Dickens wrote it doesn't affect the appeal of this story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this series was brilliant! Began with the Hunger Games first book to see what all the fuss was about and ended up engrossed and entertained throughout. An easy read. Horrifying. Suspenseful. Just loved it!
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This book was a great read. Really funny and would make a great movie too. Was exactly what I needed for a good laugh!
0345803493|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for someone.<br />Everyone was talking about these books so I purchased all three.<br />She really enjoyed them.
B003DZX44I|4.0|Bought for a Christmas gift. Could not find in the store.  Timely arrival. Only problem was the case was cracked.  But DVD was fine.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while!!! Can't wait to read the other 2 in the series
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Iain M Banks, and this is one of his better books.  If you are new to this author, start with one or two of his earlier novels, so you can better appreciate the in-jokes and his trademark style in this one.  In particular, he has an enormous amount of fun with the names of the Culture Mind ships.  His writing is the most intelligent I have encountered in this genre.  Highly recommended.
B0036T31YY|4.0|This is Genius - I went into it \\"cold\\" without knowing anything about it; a third of the way through I suspected Genius at work,and by the time I'd watched it through the first time, I discovered that my jaw had been resting on the floor for much of the film and I was impressed and delighted by such a rewarding experience.  This film is a skillful, mind-bending adventure that works well on so many levels; the musical score, the setting, the performances, the pacing, with a special nod of awe to the lighting - everything is delivered in perfect measure so that no one element overshadows or takes away from another.  There are unexpected twists, shockers, and surprises throughout -  nothing comes too slow or is forced along to make it feel \\"compressed\\" or over-edited.<br /><br />Medicinal Cinema especially for observant viewers who pay careful attention and have been waiting for an unexpected surprise. Go Ahead and enjoy this. To be fair and honest, this same idea and setting has been seen before on vintage Twilight Zone and Night Gallery TV episodes, as well as one Stephen King short story dealing with deja vu.  Without giving too much away, if you look closely enough at some of the interior scenes, it's evident that expenses were indeed spared with some of the set construction, the overly spartan, art deco motifs of the dining room and theater, but you'd have to be an historic Ocean Liner fan to pinpoint the lack of curvature in the decks, crooked paint brush strokes on some of the surfaces that weren't supposed to show up, that did. Yet this is allowable, because the lighting was a critical element that contributed much of the feeling the film carries.  However, I'm nitpicking as even these minor things don't detract from what I happily regard as one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of my new favorites. I've purchased this film after my instant view expired.  Genius.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|the story was very heart warming,and very honest, makes one stop and think what is ahead in ones life. enjoyed very much
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Love this game and so do my kids.  Too many adds though. That is whyit got 4 stars instead of 5
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I'm very pleased with this watch. Looks great, nice and heavy, fairly smooth automatic movement and feels good to wear. I have received several compliments already and my buying experience was good. Have only had it a few weeks, but so far no problems mechanically. I would definitely buy another Invicta, in fact already have my eye on a few. This is a bigger watch but not too big, good proportions. I feel this watch has great value for the money. A lot of the high end dive watches are just too small for my taste. Thumbs up.
0525952926|5.0|I love Ken Follett's writing and this is no exception.  It is a long read, but a great read.  When I pick it up I hate to put it down.  I would definitely suggest reading Fall of Giants before this.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Same as title. Might be one game I can actually do well playing. Fun but too easy to loose credits due to fast button pressing and can move a little slow at times.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|As described. A great gift idea.  Was exactly what was wanted.  No complaints or other comments, it is a great gift for yourself or someone else.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Its a great movie, we enjoyed the animation and all the spectacular sites along the journey.  I would recommend this to anyone!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Bought with great expectations and they were fulfilled.  Recipient very pleased.  Quality very good, just as described.  Very good item.
B000FC146C|5.0|This book just gallops along without one being able to put it down.  Though it is a touch old fashioned, one has no trouble relating to the characters and a certain way of Australian life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Yep great very touching can't wait 2read d next book the end was by far the most touching part he err at book
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is the stuff of Dreams and Nightmares - it is almost unbelievable but the descriptions of being lost at sea are so real and detailed, that it makes it 'all come to life'.  Recommend to anyone who is blase about their life and thinks they have done it all!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Love the premise. Good acting that kept you engaged until the end. Damon is a talented actor and he brought it here. I bought into his character.  Some of the dialogue was weak, but I’m willing to overlook it. I have already recommended this movie to friends.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Deep, lots of interesting information, very personal without being overly sentimental.  Made one think about this ending to life which will come to us all and the more prepared/accepting we are, the better we go.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|protects kindle fire HD 7&#34; very well while being light weight.<br />it looks good and looks like a regular book.
0807014273|4.0|Overall, the personal memoir of Victor Frankl was very good.  Even though Frankl was not telling all of the many horrors of concentration camp life,  the few details he shares are enough to make one cringe.  Human depravity has led to many horrific events, such as the concentration camps.  The overall message of this book was that of finding meaning in life.  As a Christian, this fits very well with a biblical worldview.  Even though Frankl falls a bit short of what the Bible teaches on the issue, he nevertheless brings out many valid points about life in general.  The second half of the book, which seeks to summarize logotherapy, was not as good as the first half of the book.  Going from personal reflection on his time in the concentration camps, Frankl provides the overall framework for his therapy of, finding meaning in life.  I would definitely recommend this book and enjoyed reading it.
0140135154|4.0|I love John Berger. I read his Here is where we meet first and leading to his other books.The condition is not so good, however what he was trying to say in this book is inspiring. It just, the pictures were too small, considering that some sections containing pictures only.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I can't describe how this book made me feel. It was written so amazingly. All through it I felt so many things, stupid, confused, happy, I laughed very hard and felt incredibly sad. The Perks of Being  Wallflower is a beautiful book and I'm so glad I read it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This was a double treat because it has two versions, one color and one B&W.  What more is there to say about this classic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I actually really liked this app. I read some reviews that said there was no description of each mini game, there clearly is a question mark that you push to give you the description you need. I liked that you can use the points you earn to unlock other games. The only problem I've had with this app is that it does &quot;force close&quot; a lot, but other than that you cant really complain about something you downloaded for free...
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I mainly got it for my grandchildren whom I think like it I just don't enjoy it but it is not because of the game it is just me
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I really love the Band Perry's musical style. It is both creative and fun. To me it has an almost bluegrass feel to it.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have yet been able to conquer this.  I have tried time and again and it says my e-mail or password is wrong so I do it on my laptop and it works everytime. Hope I can figure it out soon
B000ATQYT2|4.0|A Muppet Christmas Carol has been a family favorite since it was first released.  We originally had it on VHS and wanted to obtain the DVD.  The quality of the DVD is very good.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have used my google search so many times I have lost count and love how hard it is to use and how useful the information I get is.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love is precious in all forms.  This is a book I would actually read again.  The characters are so real, you get connected and attached to the quickly.
B00425S1H8|3.0|The adapter came with female threaded nuts that cannot be removed.  To attach to the computer, they need to be male.  That meant finding a male to female adapter that had the right threaded bits to make connection to the computer possible.
0812982622|4.0|This is one of the most original books I've read in a long time. It is dark and strange and totally unexpected. Great prose, setting, and characters. There are very few books where you have no idea where the plot is headed and you are kept guessing, uncertain what is really going on at times.<br /><br />The first half is pretty much perfect, the second half is a little weaker, which is why this is rated four stars instead of five. The book could have used some trimming and the author got a little too creative for his own good. The multiple points of view of the second half, along with some strange plot twists, defuse the tension and also strain credibility at times. That said, I'm very glad I read this book and still think about its horrors, insights, and magical touches.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|I spent an hour getting past the first level. It was fun but frustrating as I tried to use my tilt sensor as a controller.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site.  I am on it all the time getting recipes and ideas.  Great for the holiday ideas.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|A beautiful production.  Kate Winslet deserved her first Oscar for her performance as Ophelia.  Most of the language is easy to follow, even if you don't have a good ear for British accents.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am on facebook all the time.  I love it.  Can talk to my kids and grandkids on facebook.  It is great.
0765325950|1.0|Seriously?  I have never written a review, but TOR gets a one-star for this epic fail.  I guess I will look at the library then - lost sale here.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was hoping I would find this on my tablet.  It is great for taking the tablet in my purse instead of carrying the big Bible to church.
0525953728|5.0|While certainly a historically important first-hand account of Operation Neptune Spear, this book's true value lies in the insight it imparts to the reader regarding contemporary special operations and special forces operators.  Special operators are, for all intents and purposes, professional athletes.  Special operations will continue to grow in importance as the US struggles to combat asymmetric, unconventional, non-state adversaries.  Straightforward, informative, an easy read, this book dispels myths and supplies facts.  There is no better book available to provide the information this book provides.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Ok.  Love this game.  I do play it a lot.  It keeps me occupied when I don't have anything else to do.
B007R4ZNWW|5.0|One of Almodovar's creepiest work, with a plot twist that goes all the way back to Tod Browning's 1932 film &#34;Freaks&#34;. Banderas gives his best performance in years, and the film has some genuinely shocking moments. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|1.0|can't find download anywhere on the tablet.  can't find can't play<br />Son was so disappointed he could not play the game
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is the master of the highly-detailed, thoroughly engaging history lesson in the guise of real people stories!  He immediately makes us care deeply about his characters while embroiling us in the nuances of the times in which they live.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of Book Three!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is great.  I need something where I could switch between books, mark important information, and let me quickly find it later.  This app excels in all dept.  Best app I have bought in months
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book holds your interest throughout. It has history, intrigue, violence and romance. A good book for Book Club discussions
B004U52VPS|1.0|I usually try to keep an open mind and not always follow other's reviews, well bad call in this case. I should have listened. The game is very frustrating for kids to set up. Okay, frustrating for adults also. By the time you actually can get the pieces to stay you have totally lost interest because you are so frustrated.
B006FE83V8|5.0|My favorite movie of all-time is made even better by the quality of Blu-ray picture and sound and by the special features that are on the disc. If you love &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird,&#34; the 50th Anniversary Edition Collector's Series Blu-ray needs to be in your  collection.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love this type of find the picture game and difference in pictures.  great puzzle game. hope they make a sequel.
B0045EA1P6|3.0|A lot of the songs are sort of silly or awkward.  &#34;All the pretty girls on a Saturday night&#34;?  Really?  A few are musically interesting, like &#34;Be Calm&#34; which is my favorite.  Maybe their more recent album is better, but this struck me as nothing special after many repeated listenings.  The lyrics are more creative than average, but in some cases sort of awkward and don't really work.
159420411X|5.0|I bought this book for myself just before christmas. I really enjoyed how easy it was to order and I also enjoyed the low price!
B004GVUPFE|2.0|Did not enjoy as much as I thought I would, so deleted it almost as fast as I bought it. usually figure out games quickly and move up through the levels.  this one turned out to be more challenging. I enjoy mindless diversions, not ones that cause me to devote full attention. parenting is a multitask profession. didn't have time for this.
B0014CDKVY|5.0|I watch it all the time on my computer and phone.  Nine more words required, Nine more words required. N
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great and much needed addition to the Kindle. I love the different metrics, e.g., how much time left for surfing or listening. Also impressed by the charging times for AC versus USB.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|This is a lot of fun.  Nothing cerebral about it, just some good action with quality cast.<br /><br />The characters are interesting.  I would recommend for a lazy day of TV watching.
B00000F566|5.0|This is a great classic movie!  For those that have not seen this movie, the title may discourage them.  There is nothing &#34;Dirty&#34; at all about this movie!  The music and choreography are fantastic!!  I highly recommend this movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm loving this show the more I watch. So far I haven't seen a single bad episode. Yes it's gritty, yes it's gross, yes there are zombies, but this show is much more about the characters survival, and coping with a changed world, than it is about scare factor.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|We love this show. A little too much nudity and sex in season 2 I believe it was. Love Jax, Jemma, and Opie. Hope Opie finds love!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I am not one to shy away from profanity or faint at violence in books or movies, but this was just vile. The language was unnecessarily vulgar and the characters were hateful. Upon finishing the book, my only thought was to go take a shower and see whether I could rinse some of the filth off.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I guess it was considered guy humor? If that guy is a young adult male. My 23 year old daughter my husband and I all hated it, our 26 year old son liked it, and was recommended by him.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book three of the hunger games is just as good as the last two. It was great, and very moving.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It was an o.k. movie. My daughter and I like vampire shows it was entertaining enough. Would not watch again.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|What can I say its Clapton!  Great music in unpluged style.  Some old some rearranged but all in the unpluged style make them sound like new.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is hands down the best processor for gaming and for just all around use. I just installed it onto my new Z77 Extreme 4 Motherboard and am very pleased with the results. I haven't overclocked it yet, but will do it in a couple days when I can get around to installing my 212 EVO on it.<br /><br />To put it simply, buy it, BUY IT NOW!!!
B00701L5XS|5.0|This is a great learning tool for sailors, Boy Scouts, EMT workers who do rescue. The slow motion option is great for follow along practice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works very well. No problems with the app. Fast. Accurate. Like a previous review don't see how to turn it off but very few occasions when I have wanted to do so.

B0028KF4M4|5.0|I love the writing on this show! Always exciting but not always predictable!! A must see. Great acting as well.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|Good movie, fast paced with plenty of action.  The story is pretty straight forward but you could do far worse for an evenings entertainment.
0307346617|5.0|In the past few years, the entertainment industry has been swept by a zombie craze. Just as vampires once used to be the most popular supernatural beings in horror, now it is zombies and assorted zombie-like creatures. The number of computer games, comic books, novels and movies about zombies can be counted in the hundreds, if not thousands. However, although World War Z does cash in on the whole zombie craze, it offers a fresh perspective. Most zombie stories are about a small group of people who suddenly find themselves attacked by zombies and do their best to survive. It is what is popularly called \\"survival horror.\\"<br /><br />World War Z is written as a series of interviews with people who have lived through zombie apocalypse. Yes, a few of the accounts are about small groups and individuals fighting hordes of zombies just like in horror movies, but most are not about fighting zombies per se. We get interviews with such varied people as the former Vice President of United States, an Australian astronaut, chief of CIA, etc. The sample of interviewees ranges from men and women in power who influenced world events during the zombie war, to simple civilians who were trying to survive on the ground.<br /><br />The war against the zombies followed four phases.<br /><br />Phase 1: Infestation. The zombie plague started in China, but it is not clear how. Was the zombie virus a random mutation, or a biological weapon? If the latter, did it escape by accident, or was it spread on purpose? We don't know.<br />From China, the virus and the zombies start spreading all over the world, usually in the form of infected people being smuggled out. Although the existence of the virus is never kept totally secret, the world as a whole pays little attention to it and it is assumed that it is some sort of exotic rabies. Governments organize black ops teams to deal with zombie outbreaks, but it does not work.<br /><br />Phase 2: Outbreak. The zombies come out in massive numbers and quickly topple human civilization. I found this part a little bit hard to swallow. Suddenly huge hordes of zombies numbering in the millions appear almost overnight. Where did they come from? It is explained that the zombie virus is not airborne and anyone bitten by a zombie takes days or even weeks to die and rise as a zombie. Also, when zombies get their hands on someone, they eat him whole, so the victim cannot rise because there is nothing left of his body.<br /><br />So where did all these zombies come from? Did the zombie virus somehow end up in the water and infected millions of people all at once? Was someone spreading it on purpose? The subject is not even touched upon.<br /><br />Phase 3: Retrenchment. Figuring out that all of human race cannot be saved, governments create fortified enclaves. People who get stranded outside are abandoned.<br /><br />Phase 4: Reconquest. Human armies rally and reconquer Earth.<br /><br />I am, of course, simplifying the plot and jumping over many things. There is so much more to the story than that. The author touches on many interesting things that most stories about zombies do not. For example, there are accounts about how dogs are used to detect and lure zombies, or how European castles become humanity's strongholds because, unlike modern buildings, they were specifically constructed to keep enemies out. There are also some things in the book that are just too weird. For example, when the outbreak starts, Israel encourages all Jews to come in and seek shelter (it makes sense), but they also invite all Palestinians living outside its borders to come in as well. Is this a joke? If anything, Israel would use the zombie war as an excuse to kick all Arabs out of the country. There is also mention of quislings. Those are people who snap under stress and start acting like zombies, including hunting people and eating them. I can see this sort of thing happening to few individuals, but in the book there are so many of them that they pose a serious threat. Humans are psychologically tough. I do not think that so many would develop this kind of madness. But these are minor points. The book is very original and good.<br /><br />Aside for the zombie plot, I sensed two themes in the book. The first one is contempt for the human race. Humans are shown, with some exceptions, to be stupid, selfish and always ready and willing to fight each other. In fact, the book quite explicitly says that had humans showed discipline, intelligence and cooperation, the whole zombie threat would have been quickly dealt with. And even at the height of the war, people still find reasons to kill each other.<br /><br />This bleak view of humanity is by no means unique to World War Z. The human race is portrayed like this in all zombie stories. In fact, this bleak view of human nature is popular in any natural and unnatural disaster, be it an alien invasion, war or \\"just\\" an earthquake.<br /><br />I do not share this view. Studies and historical research show that in case of massive disaster, when their lives are at stake, people band together. They demonstrate discipline, resourcefulness and put their differences aside. Yes, there are always exceptions, but exceptions are not the rule.<br /><br />The second theme in the book is a sense of loss and empty victory. The war against zombies was won, but the victory is not complete. For one, small pockets of zombie \\"resistance\\" still remain and a few regions of the world are completely overrun with them. So in a way, even in military terms, the war is not over since the \\"enemy\\" is still out there and \\"fighting.\\" But the war is an empty victory in another way. The victors bear terrible psychological scars. They have witnessed terrible things and lived through horror. It marked them, and they will never be the same. The horror will stay with them to the end of their days. It is the same as with the real wars. The survivors do not escape unscathed and even the official victors are psychologically wounded.
0307352145|4.0|This book is an impact full read. So much to take in, weeks later, I'm still thinking about it and mentioning it to everyone I encounter.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game play was good, graphics very good for the type of game. Never able to complete final three achievements for: posting to Facebook (said it wasn't properly configured to logon) and completing all 22 of each Monaco and hidden object achievements. Even when playing multiple times, I could only ever receive 21/22 for each. Thought the bonus game would give me the final for each, but no go. Frustrating to play through four times and be unable to complete all achievements on a pay to play game.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoy this series! I find it very suspenseful! All the characters are very interesting and you get to know them on a very personal level! I find myself sitting on the edge of my seat, really getting into the story line! If you enjoy a suspenseful show, you will not be disappointed if you buy it!
B0000DG5NI|5.0|This DVD is of the celebrity gala concert on 22nd February 1985 at NYC Town Hall in honour of Blue-Note records, and is probably the best jazz-concert film ever made. The top-rank jazz musicians include Herbie Hancock, Stanley Turrentine, Kenny Burrell, Ron Carter, Stanley Jordan (an epic solo performance on electric guitar), Art Blakey and Tony Williams among the luminaries.<br /><br />The quality of music is top class throughout, with a relaxed and good-humored rapport between the audience and musicians who (in various combinations) improvise around a range of classic numbers. A full list of highlights would be a long one but would include `Cantaloupe Island', `Moanin' `Appointment in Ghana' and Charles Lloyd's `Tone Poem'.<br /><br />The concert was filmed on celluloid and originally released on video. The DVD re-release is a radical re-edit with many of the long shots replaced by close-ups of the musicians (an undoubted improvement) and enhanced image quality. More controversial is the exclusion of some performances from the original film, notably from Charles Lloyd, McCoy Tyner & Stanley Jordan. As all the original concert was recorded and filmed from multiple camera angles, would it be too much to ask for an unedited DVD of the entire concert?<br /><br />These quibbles however don't detract from this as the definitive jazz concert film. It's so good, even people who claim to `not like jazz' might be won over.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I usually don't read books like this. I love the suspense of a book and usually a typical \\"love story\\" doesn't have that quality. This book has a great story, keeps you guessing and doesn't completely follow the everyday love story. I would recommend this book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can honestly say that this book is the best book I have ever read. A beautiful story that has such deep meaning yet so much humor and life to it. I think everyone should read this book. End of story.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is absolutely addicting - like a more intelligent version of 24 with less violence or action and more thinking. Watch one episode, my guess is you will become hooked.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just keep coming back. Really simple yet entertaining and addictive. I love all the coin prizes and its so much fun to shake! Download now you won't regret it!
0446577383|5.0|We loved this book and decided to get it for my husbands father for Christmas.  The price was great and the shipper did an excellent job getting it to us on time.  The next four books in the series are good too.  You won't be disappointed if you like spies, intrigue, honor and integrity, plus excellent writing.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is a great toy for any girl that is into Monster High Dolls etc.  There is a great amount of detail and this item was relatively easy to construct!  It's a great toy because you can incorporate this toy play with other Monster High offerings!  Another GREAT feature is that you can store the pieces of this item inside of it when it is neatly packed up and put away until the next time they take it out to lay with it.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|the play is fun. the ideas are engaging. I wish the people would do more when I'm not playing,  maybe an ability to &quot;list tasks&quot;?
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Very cool graphics, the puzzles are actually challenging and story line is neat. I had to look up some of the walkthroughs online, that's one of the reasons this is a great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what i need it to do, designed well, and easy to use. the best part about it is that it's free. =)
0525478817|5.0|Very funny. Very touching. But not sentimental. Often you didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Appealing characters. Couldn't put it down. Liked it so much I got two additional copies for friends for Christmas.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|This is an excellent book for teenagers and young adults, not for kids however, as it uses profane and inappropriate language at some times.  I highly recommend this book to anyone of appropriate age.  Steinbeck used a complex storyline to keep the resolution a total mystery.  As the story unfolds, the reader is given clues as to the eventual outcome of the story, and yet, it still comes as somewhat of a shock to the reader.  It was an excellent, fascinating book with an ending that will leave readers stunned.  I think that students should be highly encouraged, and possibly required to read this book.  This book is a true classic, and deserves higher praise than it is already awarded.

B00A135YUW|5.0|I was shown a video done by her and decided to buy her album.  I love her style and the sounds in the songs.  She adds emphasis and raw feeling to her song with explicit lyrics in her songs.  Such an innovative, unique and fantastic artist!  Get the album!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Who doesn't like a classic disney animated feature.  If you love one you love them all.  This is as good as any.
B00A17AD36|5.0|This album gives the listener great modern soul/ R&B music to listen to and I love the explicit lyrics.  Not a totally clean album but the cursing in the lyrics give expression to the feelings a person experiences when experiencing love before, during and afterwards.  It helps you to fell the struggle of which we all go through.  The sounds are amazing whether you have a normal sound system but if you have a great sound system or set of headphones you can hear every single beat and sound that enriches the music.
159562015X|4.0|I am not sure the total value of this book, but it sure makes you &#34;feel good&#34;.<br /><br />Make sure not to buy a used copy of this ever, for the value lies in the online portion which is only allowed for 1 user of the book.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Unlike this app and have no trouble with it and would recommend it, it's actually the first app I bought on my old Fire

B007IXWL2C|5.0|great triology.  It keeps you reading.  At 1st I didn't like it but by the end of 1st book I had to order book 2 and then book 3
B001CQONKY|5.0|This is the season of the writer's strike so it is a shorter season.  It keeps true to its CSI form and continues the personal character development without losing the science and cinema aspects that made CSI the most popular show on television.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The family is hooked on this game.  We all love it.  My daughter in law went on the road and didn't have a Kindle Fire so I let her take mine so she could play this game on her down time.  She is really hooked.  Great game for the family.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|I can't get anyone I know to appreciate this witty and intelligent movie.<br />For a seasoned movie watcher looking for more complex characters than the dull, cookie-cutter American film landscape offers, the cast of Submarine has banded together to provide excellent viewing. It's a watch-beginning-to-end type of film.  It's smart and funny.
075669812X|5.0|Nice solid book, came with an extra figure that was the one my son seemed to not have (lucky for Santa). Great info on different Lego building of Nijago sets. Was a great addition to our Lego mania in our home!<br />Quick ship.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of my favorite casual games, it has replay value and just a fun and addicting game overall. Definitely recommended.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved the honesty and creative and relatable descriptions. The beginning is seems a bit drawn out. I wanted a little more closure with the rest of Pis life.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is one of those games that you just can't seem to put down. It's always &#34;I'll stop after this one&#34; but you never stop, you just can't.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game as well, and i  did get the 3 stars on these after hundreds of times of replay<br />shopping at Amazon.com is sooo easy..<br /><br />Thank you to the crew at Amazon<br />xoxoxoxo

B002MQYOFW|5.0|U are a awesome wrighter I loved this book! It was great try to come up with something else it was great :-) !!!!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I could do with more levels, but this is pretty cool and really fun although frustrating at times. I have no idea how to bring up the new bird tutorial popup though, so I don't know what some birds really do because my friend played some of the levels and I didn't see the popup the first time.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book and became so attatched to the characters i could feel the emotions and overall i could relate. I think this book will be timeless. I looooooooooooove it.
B003P8D6JQ|1.0|I have no way of even listening to this! It downloaded as an .amz file and will NOT play on my laptop or allow me to transfer it to my MP3 player. So, I wasted 10 dollars. I will be sure to never purchase any music through Amazon again.<br />Basically, I have a file on my computer now that I can do nothing with.
B006X8GFBQ|2.0|I'm usually a huge fan of Reynolds' work, and when I saw this one I grabbed a copy straight away.<br /><br />Unfortunately I found it dissapointing, for two main reasons.  Firstly, the characters didn't work for me - they do not appear realistic in their interactions.  There is one scene where the main protagonist is meeting his sister's boyfriend, and they're arguing.  As I'm reading, I'm thinking, \\"Awesome - there's going to be some dramatic tension here, something to act as a catalyst against the brother and sister relationship.\\"  Towards the end of the dialogue, the author throws in a line where the protagonist decides he likes the boyfriend character.<br /><br />Wait, what?  How did that happen?<br /><br />Second main reason is the story didn't grab me.  The premise is interesting, but doesn't appear as lovingly crafted as (for example) House of Suns.  I kept trying to force myself to finish this (which I eventually did) rather than having a can't-put-it-down experience that Reynolds is so well known for.<br /><br />On the other hand, my girlfriend read this and loved it, but can't get into Reynolds' other works (she finds them too \\"high scifi\\").  Blue Remembered Earth may be a voyage into a new customer group for the author - it didn't work for me, but your mileage my vary.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Laughed enough that this gets a thumbs up from me. Crazy concept, but it worked. Crude and simple, but worth a watch.
0441013074|5.0|This is the Reynolds work that I quote to my friends as his best.  You really should read it before you die - especially if you like a love story with your future universe.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This book reviews the economic history of different cultures, cities and states to support the authors' thesis that economic mobility within society is the key element to develop economic power. Nations that have closed socio-economic tiers fail to develop their economic potential or even worse,  fall back to poverty when their society groups become inmovible or closed.
B0049MPHY4|5.0|Being a fan of Reynolds' other works, I requested (and received :) a copy of House of Suns for Christmas.<br /><br />It is probably his best work since Century Rain - delightfully imagined, with a unique spin on how the future could unfold.  Without FTL, Reynolds' tells a story where humans live for essentially as long as they like, voyaging between worlds and picking the best that each has to offer.<br /><br />Throw in a dash of machine intelligence, wormholes, and space battles and you have an epic that's worthy of your collection.  I loved it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone girl was a different book. Very good with lots of twists. The ending is a real twist, held your interest the whole time.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I loved this movied when it was first released. I enjoyed it even more when I watched it with my 13 year old daughter. Funny and insightful to her high school years.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena is the # 1  book of the heroes of Olympus and best book of the year
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E L James is a beautiful writer. Networking choices and carefully crafted characters make for a wonderful novel. Christian Grey is a beautiful disaster of a man that gets more and more interesting. This book is nit just about sex, the psychological and emotional implications of these character's lives is highly remarkable. Could not put it down.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I had no idea what this show was about but after watching the first episode I purchased the entire season.  I'm only sorry that season 2 has not come out yet!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Ideas pop up at the strangest times and Evernote allows me to capture them regardless of the time of day,  location or device.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Men In Black 3 so funny I love them all! Great &#34;back in time - to show how things began&#34; type of movie.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Fabulous quirky movie.  Watched with my love and we really enjoyed it.  It made for a greate movie night at home.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved how Spark kept me interested from the first pages. Easy reading but in a good way.  Refreshing for anyone who is troubled with people who abuse either mentally or physicality.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Paid extra money for HD and Amazon would not stream it in HD, only SD but still charged me for HD, I have 24 meg service and stream everything else in HD no issues, watched complete movie in SD on 10ft screen and it sucked, after the movie then Amazon re-checked my data connection and said it could be watched in HD, it would not do this until I completed the movie in SD. Amazon would not refund my money so it's a rip off to pay to watch via Amazon rentals.
B00005JM02|5.0|A good movie.  My great grandsons loved it. It was in very good condition when it arrived. We will watch it again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written, suspenseful, heart wrenching (at times) book.  Keeps you guessing until the very end.  I found I couldn't put the book down.  Highly recommend.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is slickly produced, has great costumes, and terrific acting. Peter Dinklage is a joy to behold. Sean Bean ain't bad, either :).
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Well,I gave it as a gift to someone else,so I really don't know.But it came on time,packaging looked fine...haven't gotten any complaint from recipient,so sure it was fine
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you plan on getting anything done,I wouldn't recommend this game...it's that addictive.  It really is comparable to the real deal!
B000RRDC4C|5.0|MARLON BRANDO SHOULD'VE GOT NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR HIS BRILLIANT ROLE AS THE VILLAINOUS COL. KURTZ. WHILE MARTIN SHEEN'S CHARACTER IS GIVEN A CLASSIFIED MISSION TO CAMBODIA TO KILL KURTZ. SINCE KURTZ TURNED INTO A RENEGADE AND PEOPLE BEGIN TO PRAISE HIM AS A GOD. SADLY THIS WAS THE LAST GREAT MOVIE FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA DIRECTED AFTER THIS THE REST OF HIS MOVIES ARE OKAY.
1452110581|5.0|My cat broke something while I was reading this book (no joke).  I think he was upset about me figuring out all of his inner kitten thoughts.<br /><br />Great read- very clever!
B000FDVOXO|5.0|Now this is how a sequel should be, taking place about 11 or 13 years after the first one. To me this movie should've at least got nominated for an oscar for best picture of 1991. Hell I would even go as far to say that even Arnold Schwarzenegger should've got nominated for best actor. Well thats just my opinion, the movie has some of the best action scenes to ever be in cinema. Even to this day the CGI T-1000 still manages to impress me, this movie helped pave the way for CGI to be used in movies. Ignore Terminator 3/4 the Terminator saga ends with this one so don't miss out.
B004U8VWIM|4.0|I've seen some reviews that make this sound like a really intense movie- maybe in the theater, but not so much at my house. That said, it was good, it held my attention, and the dancing was beautiful.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It kept me interested through almost all of it.  I loved the first half, but then it kind of went downhill for me.  The end was just ok.  But it was worth a read.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I'm not super enthralled with Paris. Never really jumped on that band wagon. But this movie is just so artful and inspiring- I literally got our my sketch pad while I was watching it. It was the one thing I wanted for Christmas and I got it. The story is just inspiring, even if the ending is a little bit &#34;and the moral of the story is&#34;
B005RDF2RG|5.0|I cannot imagine ANYONE of any age who would not find this film to be a delight. A first viewing is pure entertainment.  Subsequent viewings reveal how truly outstanding the screenwriters are with their sly presentation of story, characters, and settings. I might have missed \\"Shrek\\" if it weren't an absolute favorite of my grandson, and am so happy that I didn't.  I confess to watching it even when he isn't visiting and marvel at the fact that I find something new each time we watch it.  The actors voicing the parts are perfection, and Eddie Murphy was robbed when he didn't receive an Oscar for his \\"Donkey\\" role.  While highly entertaining and filled with brilliant double entendres, \\"Shrek\\" is very much a subtle morality play that reminds us that beauty and wealth can never replace innate goodness, and being \\"different\\" is just fine.<br />PS:  I feel highly qualified to review this purchase.  It's a replacement for the first one we wore out with our repeated viewings.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a fantastic story. Well written, well paced, the whole nine yards. It's a quick read for an adult and I think most middle grade kids. The photos are awesome, and totally make me want to start going to estate sales, finding photos and using them as writing prompts.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Let's start with what WWZ isn't.  It isn't the tale of some individual or family as they struggle through the zombie apocalypse.  If that is what you want, there are dozens of options available, many of them very, very good.  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of combat and violence in this book...but it is there within the greater context.<br /><br />What this book is, as the title itself suggests, is a description of what the world war effort would be to stop then push back the zombie waves.  Each chapter is a story in this effort, and they range from focusing on one individual, to the responses of an entire nation.  You ever wonder how would a nation ever pick itself up and fight?  How would some of the fringe nations react?  Would there be leaders to inspire?  How would armies designed to fight modern armies adapt?  That's the sort of stuff this book delves into...and that is exceptionally rare in the zombie genre.<br /><br />This was one of the first books I ever bought after getting a Kindle, and I could not stop reading it.  So good that I actually re-read it, something I don't bother to do since I remember books too well.  Utterly engrossing.  It is sad that it is being made into a movie because no movie will ever capture the breath of this book (a miniseries, however, would be great).<br /><br />You will never look at a bottle of root beer the same again.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a hard and very challenging game and with patience one can be successful.  It is good for all age groups.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  What I loved about the movie besides the writing, acting, direction, etc. is that there wasn't a single person shot, or blown up in the movie.  It's been a week since I have seen this movie and I can't stop thinking about it.  This movie isn't really about mixed martial arts it's about a dysfunctional family and what people will do to protect their families or military brother during desperate times.  I thought this was just another boxing type of movie like Rocky but it is so much more than that.  Yes the fight scenes are exciting, amazing and gruesome but it's the dynamic of the family.  The relationship between an absentee alcoholic father and his two sons.  Nick Nolte was nominated for every award for his role as Paddy Conlon (the father).  Joel Edgarton is also amazing.  But british actor Tom Hardy is outstanding.  I cannot say enough about Tom Hardy.  In my opinion he replaced Marlon Brando, DeNiro, etc.  This movie should have been nominated as best picture and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgarton should have also been nominated, not just Nick Nolte.  If a movie can make my 21 year old tough son cry and show emotion both times he saw this movie, then this is one of the greatest movies ever.  Yes this movie does use some standard hollywood cliches but the outstanding writing, acting and direction of this movie totally melts those hollywood cliches completely away.  If you only watch Quentin Tarantino crappy movies then this is not for you.  By the way, QT is one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood.  Guy Ritchie is a much better director than QT.  Snatch was brilliant.  I love the way he directs movies.  I don't need to see someone's face or head actually being shot off.  I can use my imagination.  I wish that Guy Ritchie had directed Pulp Fiction or any of QT's movies.  They would have been 100 times better.  Personally I think QT should just write scripts and leave the directing to actual professionalslike Scorsese.  Scorsese never glorifies violence.  He uses violence to do the opposite.  Every violent character in his movies you despise they are never glorified.  He makes the mafia look like serial killing A-holes, which is exactly what they are.  QT 100% glorifies violence.  I have no desire to waste my money on a &#34;joke&#34; movie about slavery directed and written by QT.  Truly laughable and a slap in the face to African Americans and what they endured during slavery in this country.  Hollywood would never agree to a &#34;joke&#34; movie written about the Holocaust.  It disgusts me that Harvey Weinstein produced this movie.  They are actually making action figures for Django.  Warrior has violence in it but it's NOT gratuitous!!!  This movie doesn't insult my intelligence.  I highly recommend this movie and so does my 21 year old son.  BUY IT!
B002GU605G|5.0|The Cult - \\"Love\\" album (omnibus edition) has the 'b' sides, demos, extended play, & remixed songs. For it time of its release, it was a new fresh & different from corp rock, metal, synthesis music, etc, being played on the radio stations & MTV. From underground imported album to promoted & pushed to the mainstream billboard charts & college charts, took off successful career & journey. Shamen / The Doors upgraded lyrical style, rocked out in their terms & meaning, excellent personality & work chemistry of recording. Enjoy this music.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son (age 21) and he loves the movie.  He loves any movie with Tom Hardy.  His favorite Tom Hardy movie is Warrior.  Highly recommend.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Good program with many options. Its also easy to use and it has the option to access networked computers. I have not had a need to try the network portion with a computer yet.

6302913055|5.0|Was looking for the VHS format forever. The classic Route 66 pit stop. After you watch this movie you will see it had everything a movie should have. Maybe good. Maybe bad. Depends on what your taste is.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Good book, too much science and not enough about God or heaven. There need to be more detailed information on heaven and God.
630018403X|5.0|A must have if you were in High School in the 1980's. The music we heard on the radio, what we wore, etc.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I loved the other other books in the series,but, this one wasn't as good also non funny. And very short, and need to add more. The beginning of the book ( about 1/3) was very good.
B00006FDCD|5.0|stephen king's it, scary and suspenseful. plays on our fears of childhood. aren't we silly for letting that happen? worth the time.

B005LAJ1PE|4.0|I went into this with hesitation and I will continue to do so as the show's creator Ryan Murphy is notorious for creating shows that start out great out of the gate (Nip/Tuck and Glee for example) and after a few seasons descend into utter trash. While this season does have plot points (more like holes) that tend to point toward this show potentially veering off into that direction, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes it's full of unnecessary sex and violence but I love that stuff. While at the root of this show is essentially horror, there are some heart wrenching moments intertwined with the genre (somewhat spoiler alerts) like Violets story and Jessica Lange's background. And this brings us to Ms. Lange. You'll be hard pressed to find a more powerfully executed and nuanced performance from television. This character makes the viewer vacillate between pity, shock, disgust, sorrow and surprisingly even humor, a well deserved Golden Globe.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that every film buff should see at least once. Even though the setting is a prison from the early part of the 20th century, it is one of the most uplifting movie experiences that you will ever have! This is the story about a convicted man (Tim Robbins) who is sent to Shawshank Prison and meets Red (Morgan Freeman)- a man who can get you pretty much anything you desire. This is also a story of hope and what it can do to a man who is locked up for life and how he changes things (and people) while incarcerated. You have to see this film at least twice to appreciate the fine acting done by Robbins and Freeman, and to see how their friendship developes and changes over time. Every actor in this film does an excellant job in their portrayals. The film is directed by Frank Darabont (who also directed The Green Mile) and he has done an awesome job of taking this novella written by Stephen King (yes, that Stephen King!) and turning it into a beautiful and timeless film. The music score is fantastic, perfect for this type of film. I highly recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate a film that has substance, will stick with you long after you've seen it and make you want to watch it again!

B00170MYIS|5.0|I bought a few spare batteries from a long road trip to Florida. These batteries held up fine through constant shooting and video in a Sony HX9V, in temperatures ranging from very hot to strong air conditioning, and from very dry weather to constant rain.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a fantastic series. The acting is wonderful and the story line keeps you quite engaged. By far the best series out! I highly recommend it.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Everything was as expected.  Timely delivery, great condition, worked as prescribed.  If you question this product or this particular vendor, sleep easy.  They are great!  Thanks again! -w
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I got hooked to this book as soon I started reading it. The whole story catches you because most people could relate to it. I would recommend this book to the whole world. Its purely amazing!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what I wanted on my kindle fire. easy to use and a great app.  I'd recommend this calculator for the kindle fire.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have never been disappointed in a Taylor Swift CD and this one is no different!  I love that she writes her own songs!  These are all great!!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I've read all of Nesbo's Harry Hole novels. This one is very dark and intense with great historical references to WWII of which I was unaware. Once again, you never know how these stories will end. Nesbo is a master mystery writer.
B0035V35PI|3.0|Ninja Assassin is a bit of an odd duck. It is obviously about ninja, but it chooses to address the ninja in terms of their fearsome mystical reputation while largely eschewing real martial arts. The result is something closer to a horror film than an action thriller- almost all the ninja mayhem, from Rain's chain flail to the innumerable shuriken that explosively tear apart the supporting cast are CG, as are most of the stunts. The results are creepy and more than a little fun to watch, but when you compare the pretend ninjitsu in this film to similar but real stunts in \\"serious\\" martial arts films, Ninja Assassin looks a little weak. The previously mentioned flail is a particularly obvious weakness, as Ong Bak 2 came out on home video about the time Ninja Assassin was released, and for much of Ong Bak 2 Tony Jaa does the same flail combat that Rain does... but for real.<br /><br />If you can close out your inner martial arts film critic and just view ninjas in this movie as crazy magical murderers who are a bit more than human (in idea often espoused by ninjas themselves in olden days and embraced by the Wachowskis here) then the movie is actually pretty decent. At its heart it's more or less just a rehash of Le Femme Nikita with a young man in the young woman's role. Ninja is raised as brutal assassin, grows a heart, has to fight other ninjas, learns to laugh and love. It's very rote and predictable, although Interpol's final showdown with the Ninja clan is a bit more conclusive (and insane) than the climaxes of more introspective assassin thrillers. Unlike the later Matrix films, this movie is short on navel-gazing and long on ass-kicking, even if that ass-kicking is mostly a cartoon.<br /><br />Special mention goes to the supporting cast in this film- 80s ninja movie legend Sho Kosugi gives a great turn as the villainous leader of the ninja clan, and to Naomie Harris, who is able to convey more depth than she did in Pirates of the Caribbean here, as well as morelikeability than Skyfall allowed her to muster.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Solid performances from a good cast<br />-Very well shot<br />-Deceptively subtle plot gives way to nutso climax<br />-Sho Kosugi!<br /><br />CONS<br />-Uses special effects fakery for stunts that would look better real<br />-Middle plods a bit
B00004SVID|3.0|This was a used recording. The jewel case was badly cracked (I use a rubber band to keep it together). Two of the tracks on the first disc will not play through on my CD player, although iTunes had no trouble with them, so I decided to keep the set.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of live performance recordings, so no matter what the quality, I probably would never give it 5 stars. At least 'Comfortably Numb' came through quite well.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|really like this app, i now know  how to dress for my quad ride to work!! also the points i get by using the weather app!! fun and cool
B007QPFGJW|5.0|No one takes a bashing and beating like Harry Hole. For an older cop he's tough as nails. Spoiler alert! You're not going to enjoy the ending of this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I will be sad when I am finished watching each episode.  What a lovely show!!! I highly recommend this program to everyone.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This has always been my favorite Pink Floyd album. While I could get bits and pieces of it on radio, all I had was an ancient cassette tape. This remastered recording is superb.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|All of the feels.<br /><br />Okay, so basically, this is spoiler-free, but still gives you an idea of how good it is.<br /><br />On a scale of Dinotopia to Pulp Fiction, this is a &#34;WTF, JOSS WHEDON IS FREAKING AWESOME WHY ARE YOU RATING THIS ANYTHING BUT A FIVE&#34;<br /><br />I disliked the ending...not the, well, death of a certain person, but the frenzied climax of the fight. It seemed a bit forced in its resolution. HOWEVER, there is no reason at all ever in this world that you should not watch this.<br /><br />Fair warning, this movie is the sequel to the show Firefly. Watch the show first, or else you will NOT get what happens in this movie, and you will think it is dumb.
B000V63C4Y|4.0|This is a short disc (I downloaded the MP3 and burned it to a CD). It does contain some new songs that my original Getz/Bossa Nova CD does not have. I'm a big fan of Stan Getz and wish there were more out there like him. His jazz is so mellow and easy to listen to.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I was recommended this book by a friend. I enjoy many different types of books; however, did not care for the flow of<br />this one . Portions dragged on and background was unclear, particularly in the beginning, while other sections suddenly accelerated and seemed to leave tremendous detail/explanation out. Not very descriptive writing. I struggled to maintain enough interest to force myself to complete it. The ending was odd and disjointed from the rest of the story. Overall disappointing.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|This CD sounds better than the original one, which was recorded on Hi-Fi stereo VHS tape. After too many years, the VCR ceased to function and the tapes were pretty worn. So I've been replacing some of them with CD's.<br /><br />I really appreciate the engineering that went into this recording. Thanks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was so enthralled by this book I couldn't put my kindle down. I especially liked the twists and unexpected turns in the book. I can't wait to read more books by Colleen Hoover.
B007RTAR64|5.0|As a collectable Barbie I felt they showed great attention to detail.  I felt she looked just like Katniss.  My daughter loved it!
B001GMH8RO|5.0|This is the best Comedy/Drama movie ever!  Patrick Swayze is GREAT and Whoopie Goldberg is the perfect medium between life here on earth and the medium between.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Works great.  It has LOTS of radio stations and pretty good searching facilities.<br /><br />I wouldn't call it a battery hog, but I use it so often, when outside doing yard work, that I ended up buying a bigger battery for my phone.  It lasted 3-4 hours before and 6-8 hours now with the bigger battery.
B0024HH32A|5.0|I love this movie. This movie is one of the best ever.  If you love Alan Alda, you'll love MASH!  What makes this movie so good is how it reflects how people in war zones make it possible to get by the horiffic tragities of war.
B0088OINTU|5.0|Fun adventure tale, with some level of truth to it.  Great photography.  A little slow paced for our modern internet/texting generation, but both my teenage sons loved every minute of it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|THIS IS A FANTASTC BOOK!!!  A must read!!!  I couldn't put it down.  Getting ready to purchase part 2, can't wait to read it!!!
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I love interesting and unusual books, but the lead character in this book was so completely amoral that I couldn't finish it.  His character never seemed to grow - and he was personally so emotionally corrupt that I simply couldn't keep reading.  It's the only book I can remember deleting from my ebooks - I don't even want to see the cover when I open the home page.<br /><br />This book got very good reviews, but I found the main character horrifying.
1466401885|1.0|I bought this book after reading the Trilogy of Fifty Shades and did not compare or come close to the page turner I was hoping for. I would not recommend it..
B005ELQVGW|5.0|bjork does it again. i never thought i would find another collection i would like as much as her first.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I got this for my daughter for christmas and I havent seen it so I cant really rate the product, but the delivery was quick and easy
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft get now<br />what are you wateing for I said now<br />you are just tring to make me mad now arn't you cause I said now
0765325950|1.0|It is unacceptable to not have this book available in the kindle format at release.  It is the ultimate sign of contempt for your audience and contempt for the direction book reading is taking.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn & Mitch Rapp never let you down!! Mitch is my favorite carachter. Do yourself a favor and read everything Vince Flynn has written. You will not be disappointed.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love the song&#34; Stay,stay,stay&#34;-it's a fun song. The whole album is good. Great price. You can even sing along which doesn'y happen with many artists now-a-days.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Black swan.  Iended up with lots of questions.  I didn't get the plot of the movie.  It was too dark for me.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I love the prices at Amazon. You can't beat them! No scratcjes on CD. Very enjoyable. My daughter was thrilled to get Taylor Swift's first Cd.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The stories were so well mingled in this universe that Max Brooks created that you actually felt like you were in the interview with them.  The story he paints is not just mindless zombie attacks that you see in entertainment now but it really talks about the things we wouldn't think of happening in a zombie invasion.  Ridiculous to think of when put on text I know but when you read the book it feels so real.  What most people complain about is that the format makes it hard to connect and feel for any said interviewee.  Though its true it makes it for an astonishingly easy read because it feels like your reading a collection of short stories that are tied into the same world.  It also makes it easier to put down and pick back up again not having to remember what happened to the protagonist three hundred pages ago before you had that big conference that didn't allow you to read much!  Anyways great book, I loved it, I recommend it, and I will read more of Max Brooks!
B009LDD5HW|5.0|This show has changed mine and many other people's lives. It is incredibly good and the actors and actresses are so talented. Its very hard for a musical to hit 26.4 million views but glee did. Please watch it, glee is amazing
B003M5AXN4|4.0|This movie unfortunately did not get the box office draw it was hoping and failed miserably.  My family and I though absolutely love it.  The Blu-Ray looks amazing with all the vivid colors and speedy scenes that take place in the movie.  The movie itself is a great kids movie as well as having some adult humor.  Overall though the race scenes, especially in Blu-Ray, do not fail to impress and if your a fan of the old school Speed Racer cartoons you'll like what the directors did to bring that world to life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|GREAT ACTING, GREAT WRITING, GREAT SETTING, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?  THE OPULANCE OF THE PERIOD IS FASCINATING AND OF COURSE HOW VERY PROPER THE ENGLISH WERE.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Blu-Ray set of this amazing trilogy comes in a nice art-decorated box, with the 3 blu-ray discs and additional information in the box set.  The movies look breathtaking in the blu-ray format, especially Dark Knight Rises.  Get this box set if not for the 3rd installment alone but for the whole series when you want to have a Batman Marathon.  You won't be dissapointed!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book at a very sad time in my home state.  Anytime you read about the death of a senseless death of a child it is so sad.  To read a book about the father of the accused was a different take on this subject and Mr. Landay did a very good job.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|What a fun twist on angry birds. I hadn't played angry birds in years but I fund myself spending time attempting better high scores!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love instant videos and I love Downton Abbey. It's nice that I can watch it right after I purchase it. Thanks!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Favorite show, watch these all the time, we could sit for hours watching this collection, and sometimes we do just that.
B0091REZMW|4.0|cure for the board well enjoyed :) especially late. at night. when you can't sleep. I love testing. my observation skills.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Can't get enough of this - love the collection - This show is hours and hours of laughter at my house.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|i love this show, i have been watching it for eight years now and i never get tired of it even with all the cast changes, i just hope that eventually morgan and penlope eventually see the light and admit maybe there's more than friendship there.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We watch these DVD all the time, these are perfect for a rainy day, hours and hours of laughter with family.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is the second Jack Reacher story I have read.  I enjoyed the first, Killing Floor, much more than this one.  There are better choices in this genre.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  I finished it in 3 days.  If your a fan of the Percy Jackson series, you will not be disappointed.
B009VB97EY|1.0|TO SUM UP THE MOVIE IN ONE WORD: GARBAGE! ...and not GARBAGE in a good way! POOR ACTING, NO SEX SCENES AND NOT ANYTHING! JUST VERY CHEAP DIALOGUE WITH BAD ACTING!
1400069289|5.0|Very informative and useful information. I will actually re-read it to get the most out of it. Definitely a 5 star book.
B007MDB548|3.0|Didn't come with the cover over the bluray case. Was expecting that due to the description, so was disappointed when it didn't have it.
B009KUANWG|5.0|In my opinion, this song stands alone as a great song.  As the theme to the James Bond movie, it works very well.  Adele's voice is beautiful as always.
B0007IF5GO|5.0|I was hesitant to order this because of the low price point, but my daughter LOVED it and it fits right in with her Calico Critters stuff.  Other than Japanese writing on the much less fancy box, it could be Calico Critters.  Couldn't be happier; the actual product is well made and just the right size for her collection.
0307279189|5.0|If you like running this is a must read. If you don't like running this is a must read. If you are unhappy this is a must read. Basically if you're human read this.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this while waiting for a class one day. I used to love playing mahjong when I was younger, was very excited when I saw this was free and have had a great time playing!
0061914177|3.0|I need something that is to the point and will keep my interest. This book could have been done in half the pages.  Tim
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A truly captivating story about Bruce Wayne's decision to return as the Batman. The plot is gripping the characters including Tom Hardy's Bane as a ruthless enemy.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and was in good shape.  I really like the &#34;Step Up&#34; movies because of the cool dancing.  Very entertaining.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|of course its a waste of time its a video game.I love bad piggies because I love to build stuff really fun game
B008220AVW|5.0|I received excellent service from the seller.  This is a great DVD for Katy Perry fans!  It shows some of her shows and some of all she goes through to put on great shows for her fans.
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|such a great movie... I first saw this movie when I was a kid and now I get to share it with my kiddo... she loved this movie...!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Her books have some romance with her stories, but &#34;clean&#34; reading that is refreshing.  You will fall in love with her characters.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I bought this on my Kindle after having lost the original paperback from years ago.  There is now an introduction and you might as well skip it.  \\"I'm a Mormon blah blah blah, I'm a mormon blah, blah blah, I'm a mormon blah, blah, blah\\"  If he were baptist would he go on and on about it?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book takes you out of your comfort zone and puts you back in it.  It grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. This is a treasure.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|I wished I would of checked this out prior to 20$ on other app and font package. I only use the basics and its great combo with g docs and all my other devices.
0765325950|5.0|I rarely review anything but I wanted to stop this nonsense from people giving 1 star to an absolutely fantastic ending to the series.<br /><br />From Brandon Sanderson's website as to why ebooks haven't been released yet:<br /><br />Question: Why a delayed ebook release for A Memory of Light?<br /><br />Answer: This is not my decision or Tor's decision, but Harriet's. She is uncomfortable with ebooks. Specifically, she worries about ebooks cutting into the hardcover sales. It isn't about money for her, as the monetary difference between the two is negligible here. It is about a worry that her husband's legacy will be undermined if sales are split between ebooks and hardcovers, preventing the last book of the Wheel of Time from hitting number one on either list. (Many of the bestseller lists are still handling ebooks in somewhat awkward ways.)<br /><br />As the last books have all hit number one, she doesn't want to risk one of these not hitting number one, and therefore ending the series on a down note. (Even though each Wheel of Time book has sold more than its predecessor, including the ones I have worked on.) I personally feel her worries are unfounded, and have explained that to her, but it is not my choice and I respect her reasoning for the decision. She is just trying to safeguard Robert Jordan's legacy, and feels this is a very important way she needs to do so. After talking about the issue, we were able to move the ebook up from the originally planned one-year delay to instead come out this spring.
B0091REZMW|5.0|if you like finding hidden items then this is just right for you. it's not on of those games when they say it's free but you pay to upgrade.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i think you should get this game because it is like temple run except it has moving objects. this is my favorite game I love it!!!!!!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|A very good book it is one of the best reads I have had for some time  Love it Love it
0765325950|1.0|I came to amazon to purchase the Ebook format for my Kindle, but it isn't available until April.  I guess I will be picking up the Pirate Bay version for free in 2-3 days instead.  Nice job TOR and Harriet Jordan.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|was given this book as a gift and I could not put it down it was such a good book
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a very enjoyable series. The sets and settings are beautiful, the characters are entertaining and the story draws you in. Very well done and very enjoyable.<br /><br />This DVD set is also very good and is a good way to watch Downton.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|Unfortunately there was just too much left to take care of, should have focused less on the battle scenes and more on tieing up the loose ends. I think it was about as good as could be expected given the mammoth job that was required but it leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied.  Dane's ending was especially pathetic.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I bought this CD because it was $0.99 on amazon for a special mp3 sale.  I had never heard of the band, but after a few listens, I love EVERY song on the CD.  Some of them I even recognized as radio singles, or they have since come out as singles on the radio.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very nice app.  Just want you would expect. The GUI is well planned and easy to navigate. Try this one.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Fun game once you get the feel for how far each bird flies. Before playing, practice launching the birds so it's not frustrating when you try and play.
B001EC0OMM|2.0|Maybe it is because the opening scene seems to be making light of domestic violence ... somehow I never could warm up to this film. The dialogue is too wordy, with too many arguments between too many characters. The worst speech is when the father blames philandering on daughters. What a crock! I had to leave the room on that one. This film is nowhere near the lightheartedness of \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\" Yuck, yuck, yuck! Get drunk, argue, have an affair. The next day everything is okay again. Surely, they can come up with better stories than that in Philadelphia (or anywhere else).
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Fan of the series and happy with the movie
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is one of the best spy flicks of all time. Just to watch the airplane scene is worth it all. My only complaint is the over-the-top dialogue in the train love scenes. This is film-making as a true art. Watch for the play on geometrical angles that are shot throughout the film. North by Northwest is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.
0765325950|1.0|I don't purchase paper books any longer. I won't purchase this book in any form other than ebook. If given the opportunity to purchase it now in an ebook format, I would already own it.  Harriet's decision to withhold this book from us is, at best, ignorant and ill informed.  I will find a copy and read it, but I will be damned if I will pay any more money towards this series after the hundreds of dollars I've already spent, only to be denied the ability to read it now in my chosen format.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie came out when i was in my late teens and it was amazing.  i'll remember it forever as an amazing show
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Collin Farrell made for a better main character than Arnold fo' sho'. This was pretty action-packed with subtle feelings of both star wars and iRobot all in one movie. Worth watching, but not super-awesome.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|I've read the reviews and I agree with most of them.<br />The story was crap.  Why is this called Brave again?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy BBC shows, but am not a fan of the filmography. This show has a BBC story, with a higher quality feel.
B003L77GH4|4.0|\\"Vampire Diaries\\" is a show that makes use of all the standard urban fantasy/ paranormal romance cliches without taking itself too seriously, and that makes it a guilty pleasure that you don't have to be ashamed of.<br />The story is the same old thing, beautiful high school coed falls for mysterious stranger/high school boy who turns out to be a vampire (who thankfully does not sparkle, or sneak into her room to watch her sleep, or anything creepy like that).<br />She is the spitting image of his long lost love and so he \\"must know her!\\"<br />He is the good guy she is looking for to help provide stability in her life after the death of her parents in a car crash.<br />You get the idea.<br />The main character, Elena (Nina Dobrev), is beautiful and all of her friends are gorgeous (sort of like they are all Hollywood actresses or something)and they hang out with pretty boys and get into supernatural trouble.<br />One of the problems that I have with the program, however, is that although the show is set in a small town in Virginia, and at least two of the characters grew up there before the Civil War, virtually no one in the show sounds like they have ever been in the south. It also bugs me that the characters frequently act out of plot driven stupidity (\\"I can't believe that this character, who has screwed us over 47 times in the last five weeks, would do something bad to us THIS time.\\").<br />On the up side, the writers frequently make fun of the standard vampire goes back to high school tropes and the characters get to make snarky comments about the fact that this tiny little town seems to have some kind of festival, or major event every other week.<br />Also, hasn't anybody notice the unusually high death rate in this tiny town?<br />On the other hand, I like the fact that the leaders of the town are not entirely dim and have some idea of what is going on.<br />The show is worth watching, if you don't try and take it seriously.
081297381X|1.0|Statistical models do not predict extremely rare events? Fitting curves to incomplete data gives inaccurate curves? Nothing new or revolutionary here, just an author so full of himself you will have a hard time stomaching the 400 pages of Nassim bashing academia and professionals using statistics right and left. To add insult to injury the writing itself is very poor, paragraphs do not transition well and the majority of the book is opinions and rants. Save yourself some time and money and stay away from this book.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Falling skies is actually a really good show, but it suffers from some minor, yet serious flaws.<br />I like the fact that the people in the show behave, for the most part, rationally, given the nature of their circumstances. One doesn't see the typical plot driven stupidity that one often encounters in adventure or science fiction television (e.g. we know that there are vampires in the town, but when we hear strange noises in the basement we assume it's cousin Clem playing a prank and stroll down into the darkness).<br />Even when the characters behave in ways that seem unreasonable its generally an action that fits the nature of their character.<br />I find it wonderful that the writers have the leaders of the group make use of all of their assets, using women and even teenagers as fighters.<br />The story is engaging, the characters are people that we can care about and the situation is one that causes viewers to ask \\"What choices would I make in that circumstance.\\"<br />Now for the bad stuff. The producers fall prey to the television/movie cliche of \\"the black guy always dies first.\\" They do this, not just once, but three times in the first few episodes. Of the good guys, in the first several episodes, only black males die. In fact, the guy who gets blown apart on the bus is introduced JUST so that he can be the only one that dies. One would think that writers, producers and directors would notice this overused trope by now and stop using it.<br />Still, overall, I like this show and think you should give it a look.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It was a good story but it was difficult to understand what they were saying.  The sound quality was bad.  Clint Eastwood mumbles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun!!! I love it and I would recommend it to anybody!! WARNING! This game is very addicting it will be hard to stop after you have started playing this game!
B0063IH60K|4.0|easy to customize settings and easy to play on kindle fire. fun but almost too easy to win :/ enjoyable and simple card game.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|If you like the classics and or Audrey Hepburn, this is a must see movie.  I like both and really enjoyed watching this after so many years.
B0091REZMW|2.0|the instructions are inadequate and when entering it doesn't necessarily enter and you have to repeatedly input the same thing.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Great album that instantly sounds like a jazz classic. Beautiful recording and arrangements. See her in person if you get a chance.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Everytime I try to open it I get weather channel will not respond try again later. So I just gave up trying to look at it
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Can you fit any more older action heroes/tough guys into one movie? A little out there, but the action was good, the comedy was good, and the heart felt drama was good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard that this was a great movie, but an even better book, and yet I can't believe how unexpectedly amazing this book was. Can't wait to read the next one.
0316789704|5.0|Excellent book!  The drawing tutorial is easily understood and followed.  My kids love it, and have been so pleased with their growing skills.  &#34;Mommy, look what I drew for you!&#34;
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh just rocks and has never stopped.  Well, he did for about 20 years, but now he's back at it with a vengeance.  I love the album!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|He made this between 007 movies.  A feel good movie, entertaining, full of action and funny too,  Gave it to my son for Christmas.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Absolutely love Frankie Valli and the Four seasons! This is an excellent CD with all of their best hits! You can just drive in your car for hours singing along with them to &#34;Sherry,&#34; &#34;Walk Like a Man,&#34; &#34;December 1963,&#34; and many more!
B004XQO90O|5.0|Watched it more than once to learn what it really meant.  Love anything with Jake Gyllenhaal  and he's super in this one.
0062200909|5.0|This is a must have for any hard-core Tolkein/Jackson fan, or even for anyone just interested in the behind-the-scenes of film. Packed full with concept images for the movie, and interesting narration by the workers of Weta who dreamed it up, as well as some input by the actors.
B005LAII8A|5.0|I was so hopelessly/annoyingly confused after 20 minutes that I thought I wouldnt finish it, but as I began to see where they're going with the story, the unusual take reeled me in. The acting is great in a sci-fi time-travel flic; a genre i usually turn off to. This had some edgy, imaginative - if not stoner - logic that once I got onboard with, found a gripping, touching and thought-provoking plot line. SPOILER: Think along the lines of Keannu Reeves killing himself at the end of Devil's Advocate.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm still a little new to Vince Flynn's books (read about 4 so far), but this was one of my favorites so far.  Keep 'em coming!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such a heart wrenching story, so glad it ended the way it did.  There is hope for the human race!
B008N1V11U|1.0|Dl'd app to my sons kindle fire.  App was WAY to large to install.  Even tried removing some of his other games like \\"papi\\" games (which are small in comparison, and could not free up the space.  Please REFUND my acct and I will rate this higher.  Never got to play so really cant say other than file size an accurate game review.  Thx.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First Kindle purchase. It was a nice, easy read. Ending was a real page turner.  Looking forward to finding my next read!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Mr. Mitchell is a marvelous writer.  Cloud Atlas is six separate stories with connections.  The first story occurs around 1850 and the last two are in the future.  Each story is in its own style, true to the time of the story - including the two in the future which have styles created by Mr. Mitchell.  The book is compelling and thought provoking.  Remembering who the many characters in the various stories are can be a task<br /><br />Each story only connects peripherally, but collectively they tell the story of mankind's nature and potential fate.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year olds birthday. Great price and he loved it. I can't get him to watch anything else.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Funny worth reading!! For bout 8 bucks recommended for youth but adults will enjoy it too lazy humor makes it lively
B00005JNJV|5.0|Bought this for my son for his 3rd bday. He is obsessed with batman. It's was great price and the movie shipped quickly. Can't get my son to watch anything else.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A bit too violent but not as bad as some of the other movies out there.  I thought Ann Hathaway did a wonderful job as Catwoman and I didn't see Marion Cotillard as the villain coming.  The twist was fantastic.  I would recommend it for all Batman fans.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great price and love this movie. My children have a blast watching it. It's always a joy getting to watch movies that my babies can laugh and want to watch again:)
1608871088|5.0|It took a while to receive since it was back-ordered but it was worth the wait. The artwork is breathtaking. My daughter purchased it with her birthday money and spent about an hour slowly paging through the hard bound book. You are able to see the character ideas from beginning to end. The book lays it out from storyboard to final design. I told my daughter to take good care of it. You cannot beat the online price. In store it is $40+. I would say this book is well worth the higher price.
0071390111|4.0|&#34;Principles..&#34; is still our Bible in neuroscience. Excellent reviews, classical knowledge and elegant design. And the schemes/pictures  are the most self-explicative that you can find anywhere
B000YDE43C|5.0|Feels very comfortable, just as bouncy as DMs and looks good with khakis and denims alike. New fave says the wife.
