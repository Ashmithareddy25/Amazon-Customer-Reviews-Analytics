1616614609|5.0|My 8-year-old gamer daughter and I have played this four times since buying the core set two weeks ago. AN transports you to a world of evil faceless corporations and unsavory hackers. The art is tremendous and the captions on the cards feature great dark humor. I love the caption that describes a hedge fund. It's timely even in today's economy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game for experienced game players. You will need some patience to get used to the gameplay and lingo, although my daughter and I are fluent in clicks, HQ, R&D, tags and most of the nomenclature, which really enhances the experience.<br /><br />Games are close with some back and forth, and trying to score that last agenda when your opponent is applying pressure builds tension. This is the coolest game I own and I will build with data packs once we get fully familiar with the base game.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Liam Neeson is a great actor.<br />Will watch any of his movies.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible! I loved it! I couldn't imagine a future as unique as this story is. It's so interesting that there are so many words you have to figure out.
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|Not funny, just sickening, disgusting, vulgar garbage.<br />Would not have bought this movie if the review had shown some of the vulgar, disgusting language.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is just one of those movies you do NOT want to miss.  BUT do NOT let a phone call or anyone else in the house interrupt the ending.  The ending lets you decide what the movie was about.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Another cute and funny movie.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|My sister conned me into watching this and  I really liked it.  I can hardly wait for the coming season.<br />I love it when grand mama slips in a zinger!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Liam Neeson is a great actor.<br />Will watch any of his movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I wouldn't miss the opportunity to purchase the series.  Excellent storyline that keeps moving throughout the series.  Perfect for the kindle fire.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Curiously, sad but true.<br /><br />Don't use social media's because of this kind of crazinest.<br /><br />The genie is out of the box!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This was my favorite game to play when I am bored I really enjoyed this amazing game . Some of them are very easy and other are hard to do. But overall I love this app.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I haven't watched many of the classic Bond films, but the exceptional quality of this one makes me feel that I should. Parts of the film are heavy on action and thin on substance, but overall the story and characters are engaging. Highly recommended.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|it's a 2 hours movie you maybe can watch without get boring. It's just another 007 movie. I might watch it again when this movie is free on amazon prime.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|this movie was riveting and your heart goes out to the family and the victims of the tsunami.  I would recommend this movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. I just wish it would be an HBO or Showtime show to cut back on the commercials.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Loved it. I was surprised by many of the turn of events. Didn't realize it was a &#34;new adult&#34; book till I purchased it, but I loved it.
B005H9B44A|1.0|Story line is rubbish. The set was well made. I need eleven more words. Bad, bad, bad, bad. I'll  finish by saying it's bad.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I recently finished Silver Linings to see what the movie was based on. I am happy to say that while the movie deviates a bit from the book, it still captures what happens in the book, just in a shorter time frame. The playbook is a quick and easy read but is very enjoyable. It deals with big issues in a comical and relatable way. Plus, you get your silver lining. And it made me appreciate my partner even more! I definitely recommend this book for adolescents and adults of any identity at any point in their life.<br />[...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games left me satisfied with the story, however it leaves me starving for the next book. A must read even if u watched the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The entire series is very captivating. Can't wait for series three. Gives me something to discuss in common with my mother, cousin in Oz and sister.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked it very much, it made me laugh and made me cry.  The characters were so genuine, I really cared about them.  I enjoyed the Eagles references throughout.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Somewhat uncharacteristically for sci-fi shows, Firefly is not about space ships and ray guns (well, at least not principally). For me, it came down to the beautifully developed characters. One can only guess how much richer they would have become if the show had not been cancelled so quickly. Each character is complex, each with positive and negative characteristics, each a bit unpredictable even within their norm.<br /><br />I didn't start out a big fan of the plots (hence 4 stars rather than 5). The sci-fi/cowboy angle is certainly refreshing, but that in itself is not enough to carry the day. However, each one is better than the last.  This is certainly a show that was ascending, and rapidly at that. Even if the first few shows don't speak to you, keep watching - you will be rewarded.<br /><br />It would be remiss if I didn't mention that Inara is one of the most beautiful and graceful characters to ever grace the screen. She really could take my breath away!<br /><br />With all this praise, I have to say I'm a little baffled by the ultra-cult status this show has attained. Excellent, yes. The best series of all time? Not for me. Oh, and a word of warning. The movie Serenity might be OK taken on its own, but as an opportunity to bring some closure to the series and answer some questions, I found it a dismal failure. Did Kaylee smile once in the movie?
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|This cd was a little of a disappointment. It is a good cd and I would buy it again but after the first few songs it is rather slow going. I really dont like the synthesized additions on some songs. Would be better if he just stayed with real musicians. Seems to be trying to be something he isnt.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great! I chose 5stars because it was interesting  and amazing. I like everything about this book I recommend that you read this book.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Somewhat boring by Lord Of The Rings standards.  Some pretty scenery, predictable stereotyped characters, funky magical creatures.  And the ending disappointed when I realized that they're splitting The Hobbit into multiple movies.
B001NHNG64|5.0|My first time reading Lee Childs. If you enjoy adventure and action you will enjoy the Jack Reacher series.Very easy reading.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first book was semi-decent so I figured I'd splurge and get the second and third books in the series...I shouldn't have. The second book was contrived and really not much of a plot line.  With the taste of a cheap harlequin romance in my mouth, it was a struggle to finish.  Doggedly determined to give the third book a chance to redeem itself I waded into it only to find myself even less enthralled than I was in book two.  Seriously, I couldn't even finish it was so bad.  You'd be better off spending $10 on a penthouse letters mag, there's more of a plot line.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I think most people who read the Huffington Post actually read. The new app \\"upgrade\\" has too much picture and too little print. When I say \\"little,\\" I mean just that. I can't believe anyone over 30 can read the text, the font is so small.<br />I cancelled my subscription, but I'll pick it up again as soon as the Huff powers that be restore substance over form.
0385349947|4.0|While this book wasnt a page turner it did leave me with many interesting ideas that I plan to use.  Being a woman in manufacturing (mainly men) I related to many of her stories.  I felt the book really was more of a conversation starter than a book about feminism as which many think it is.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun, and challenging game.  I haven't advanced past two suits, but I  enjoy playing at this level.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Simply superb! I could not put it down! This is the 3rd Archer novel I have read & absolutely loved it. Archer is one of the best authors at weaving complicated plot lines, myriads of fascinating characters & unexpected twists.  He is one of my favorite contemporary authors & this work will not disappoint!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Christoph Fischer<br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners<br />The Three Nations Trilogy #1<br /><br />I'm not sure I've ever willingly read historical fiction, so was shocked at how much I enjoyed this book.  I soon found myself completely immersed in the story, the history and how the war was affecting each character.  Incredibly well written, it was obvious the author had thoroughly researched the subject and the emotions of the story were easy to see throughout.  I knew how the war had affected where I live, and had heard many stories from my grandparents, but seeing a completely different view was definitely an eye opener.<br /><br />I received an e-copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review.
B004I4M0A2|3.0|This app was alright, I just thought it would be a little bit more like the website.  I have already deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
B00AGKH45I|3.0|This Fleetwood Mac Rumors Deluxe Edition set is nice, but some of this has been already been released.  A few years ago the Rumors CD was re-released as s 2 CD set.  Those 2 discs were the regular CD and the outtakes, the same as disc 5 on this set.  I am not a fan of live CD's so the disc 2 on this set was nothing I really wanted.  I don't play records so the vinyl doesn't mean much to me.  I didn't realize it at the time, but I spent the money for a bunch of repeated items or items I didn't really care for.  The DVD (disc 3) on this set is nice, but is very short, about 30 minutes or so, big deal.  So, if you don't have any of these tracks except for the regular CD or LP itself then this might be something you want to get.  There is a 3 disc set, but it is disc 1, disc 5 and the DVD in this set so that was no big deal for me.  I love Fleetwood Mac, but I am somewhat disspointed with thie release.  I hope they don't do the same for any other releases they are thinking of putting out.
1430319321|5.0|I loved this book.  I have been trying to understand strategy and find the use of notations to be difficult to understand.  This book explains in words the ideas behind the strategy and then gives you examples to practice.  Right now I am studying back row mating- how to trap or lure the king in many different ways.  I love the simplicity of the explanations and find it is very usable in actual game.  It does not require any memorization since it is based on logic and reason.
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|If you like Stephen Stills then you should like this set.  Graham Nash is one of the producers on this set so it has to be good.  This has all sorts of unreleased tracks on it not to mention a track by Stephen and Jimi Hendrix.  There are tracks from Buffalo Springfield, CSN, CSN&Y and several other bands Stills was involved with.  There are 2 tracks on this set that were released on 2 Stills albums with Ringo Starr on the drums, but these are outtakes.  This Stills (S) set makes a nice addition to the David Crosby (C) and Graham Nash (N) sets.  Each set has large letters C, S, and N on the spines so if you put them next to each other they will be CSN.  It isn't as good at the Graham Nash set, but it is better than the David Crosby set.  Again, if you like Stephen Stills you should like this set and is well worth the price.
B007MAETA8|5.0|While this doesn't contain a lot of the sugary sweet, mainstream style songs that made John popular (Daughters, Your Body is a Wonderland, et al.), this album has some of the best songwriting from him yet.  You see a lot of his 70's and country inspirations in this album, as critics have mentioned.  It shows a real depth and departure from pop.  He's bearing his soul.<br /><br />John's never been much of a vocalist, but he's really established a unique style and is being more true to himself as an artist.  I've loved this album since it came out, and recently bought a copy for my 69 year old father who hasn't liked any young artist in a good number of years.  Probablyo the most affirming review I heard of Mayer was from his, who enjoyed the musical aspect as a fellow guitarist; the music is easy to play along with and enjoy.  He also was quick to point out that given the song-writing and musical talent, though not so much a vocalist, he was greatly influenced by and has a similar style to Kris Kristofferson.<br /><br />John probably will not be remembered so much as a singer, but a poet who really bared his own soul and reflected the spirit of our time, and I suspect when I'm 69, I'll be passing on his music to my own kids and grandkids who will still find him \\"cool.\\"  To sum this album up in a single word:  Timeless.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I have nothing but good things to say about the series.  Very quality show.  Thanks for making this available on Amazon Prime!
B0092SQBJA|5.0|Another album from Two Door Cinema Club where I love every song.  Right now I can't get enough of the title 'Sun'
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Though a fan of fantasy books, I am still not sure of this one. I enjoyed reading it and the idea is very original but I don't know if I'd recommend it!
B000I9UA8U|5.0|So funny, I couldn't stop laughing. My favorite scene is when they are in line at the job center, fantastic!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|better than most of the other banal stuff one<br />sees on tv....pity one has to wait so long for<br />episode 4
0061950726|5.0|Great book would highly recommend;Christina is an excellent author;great history;read in one afternoon;learned a lot of history;great factual information Tammy Trebesch Hamburg MN
B008JFUUIA|5.0|What an incredible cast of acting and performing talent!  The acting, music and dance were so entertaining and uplifting.  (Although, I do feel they carried the 'Fat Amy' theme too far. She can refer to herself that way, but the others should not).<br /><br />This has become my 'go to' movie for lighthearted antics and performance.  Anne Kendrick played an excellent Reluctant Student and Anna Camp excelled as their Perfectionist Leader.<br /><br />Brittany Snow has Always been noted for her high quality acting skills (American Dreams, Harry's Law) but evidently she can sing as well!  (Note: She has started an initiative entitled 'Love is Louder' as a healing response to the recent spat of school gun violence... hopeful).
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|It's a great movie, set in Los Angeles in the 1940's.  It was very accurate from what I could tell.  There is also a lot of violence.  If you don't mind that you will enjoy this movie.
B001EBROWQ|5.0|This used to be on every Easter in the old days, but now I never see it on anywhere, so i rented it from Amazon Instant video. This is a classic movie and it is a nice retelling of the basic biblical version of Jesus's life. It's a good way to get to know him if you don't know anything about him. Max von Sydow is a little over the top dramatically as Jesus, but not too bad. I like Telly Savalas as the Roman governor.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Lost keeps you on the verge of your seat. The show has twists and turns that keep you guessing. Lost has a great method of adding new characters and making you love or hate them in one episode. Truly great entertainment.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis brings the essence of Lincoln the man and Lincoln the president alive in this movie. Some people felt it started slowly.  It is not meant to be action packed. This movie is meant to be absorbed from the dialogue, the lighting, the cinematography, the acting and the subject matter.  The congressional debates and the orchestrating of the timing of the vote on the 13th Amendment may make you wonder if politics has changed at all in the past 150 years. Spielberg gets it right again!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|When I tried to put some of my movies on the kindle they wouldn't play and I thought that I was going to have to buy a video converter. Then I downloaded MoBo and it plays everyone of my movies and shows. This app has been a life saver!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|i went into this book expecting nothing and not knowing anything about it.  it was really like two different books from the first half to the second half. i understand the lead up to the second half and all of the background, but the change comes so drastically that it seems like two books. it is very well writting...with a few parts that might drag a bit...but all in all a good read.
B0042AGN6Y|5.0|Great movie and fast shipping. Movie looks and sound great. Like new. Movie will always be a good watch. I can watch it numerous times and never get tired.
B002KVCA1O|1.0|I tried three times to download and nothing! Igot charged and got nothing............Looks like a ripoffor a hoax to me,,,
B000059MEL|5.0|Favourite of their releases. Great gatefold release, and beautifully printed. Thankfully for once their postage was actually able to protect the item well.
1616550414|5.0|This is the perfect addition to any Zelda collection, and I highly recommend it! The book is big, solid, impressive, and has tons of information on every part of the Zelda universe. From the inception of the original game in the '80s to the modern works of Spirit Tracks and Skyward Sword, this one has it all.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Same as last book review. Basic writing but good story. Have re-read 3 times and think I have had enough now.
B00B6KJ0AE|4.0|I like the album.  It's not as hard a rock as some of their older stuff, but it's a good mix.  Very listenable album.  I purchased the album about a week ago and have listen to the entire album three times.  I normally don't listen to all song on  an album.  These days it's getting harder and harder to find any rock n' roll music, let alone any thing good.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The writing was a little basic, and the way the author explains Ana gets a bit annoying at times, but good story.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Wonderful music! Wish I had discovered him long ago! A bit of country music and Irish Jigs at their best.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Basic writing, Ana is annoying, but overall a great series and Im sure ill read it for the fourth time in the future.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|M83 nails another electronic album. The film would be drastically different without this work. A large range of emotion underlined with heavy drums and 80's synth.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good acting, good writing, and interesting plots.  The characters seem real and the dialogue is not contrived.  You start liking the characters in spite of their imperfections.
B005SV9X22|4.0|I am a big fan of Lady Gaga.<br />She is so much more than her music and stage presence.<br />I feel many people don't fully understand what she represents<br />and how she has impacted many of her 'Little Monsters'.<br />We need to look beyond her shocking performance and see<br />the real Lady Gaga.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I just enjoy all the XMen movies. Now my collection is complete. Wish they would come out with another movie.
0375851569|5.0|This is an excellent book collection. Many favorites are to be found here. Dr. Seuss books are -very- educational for young people and most fun to read. I especially like the nice size of the books. They are also hardcover and thus will hold up for years. Excellent book collection.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love all of the cut the rope games. I always try to get all the stars. Best game ever !!!!!!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|As expected, Michael Buble released another great album doing a great job singing. The tone of his voice is just so unique and soothing.<br /><br />The CD itself though, coming from a fellow musician like me, the recording mix is a big disappointment.  The recording mix is so flat its like listening to a cassette stereo 20 years ago.<br /><br />With all the latest  available technology nowadays to produce a tight, dynamic and impressive recording mix - this CD release fell short big time.<br /><br />I urge all of you to do a comparison check between your favorite CD that is recorded and released lately and listen to this CD on the quality of recording mix and tell me what you think.
B003IWRE3I|3.0|The book was so much better. The movie was OK, but sometimes seemed to not always bear the weight of the story.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is such a cute animated film. The streaming quality on the instant video (I streamed it to my ipad) was great- no problems at all, good visual and audio quality. Its just another great instant video experience!
B004LQGXLE|5.0|great classic movie! they just don't make them like they used to apparently. And I was born in 1986. Really says something
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A secret society, tech world meets old world, a bit of a mystery, a new discovery, and everything solved to satisfaction--enjoy it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|OMG NECORA VIRUS IS SO AWESOME! The only thing bad is that it is IMPOSSIBLE!!!!! Even on casual every time I try it even my friends can't do it!!! Fix!
B009E7MA9E|5.0|Algiers is already a great record. These three bonus tracks are a perfect fit, not an afterthought but fully formed songs that extend the mood. &#34;Dead Moon&#34; is especially haunting. Worth it, even if you already own a copy of Algiers.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The sequel was even better than the first one. I LOVED this book. I loved that there was actually competition for Maxon's affection instead of just singular love for America. As much as I hated him paying attention to other girls and felt America's pain when he did, I think it was absolutely necessary to keep up the momentum of the book. I liked that there was more conflict, drama and twists and turns in general. I liked that Maxon was more \\"real\\" and less \\"perfect\\" than he was in The Selection. I liked him before but I love him now. My only complaint was that I felt absolutely no chemistry between America and Aspen and so it was difficult for me to buy that he was an actual contender and not just the possible consolation prize in the event Maxon chose another girl. Another cliff hanger and I cannot wait until the third installment!
1400069807|5.0|When I picked up this book I could not put it down. I saw the author on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
B00000273M|4.0|I always loved their classic songs &#34;Walk like an egyptian&#34; and &#34;Manic monday&#34;, but the rest of the album showed me great themes, by no means to be considered as mere filling material. Special mention for the version of Simon & Garfunkel's &#34;Hazy Shade Of Winter&#34;. Great choirs and music. Lovely.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Keeps you going for hours finding clues...best . One yet I found and wished I can finish the entire game but now . It's . Stopping me. It is interesting though.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Just downloaded this game after playing it on my friends kindle and now I can't stop playing it!  Great fun and a quick game to play.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read this series because it was recommended by a friend. I find myself struggling to get through the series. It took 1  month for me to read the first book and 4  to read the second. Anna sounds like an immature teenager and grey is like a 40  year old stuck in his ways. I'm not enjoying these books. I feel like I have to finish only because I've started the series. I would NOT recommend this book
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I play this all the time although I prefer the version on my laptop.  This version is based on time and reshuffles the cards when there are no remaining moves.  I prefer to take my time and plan my moves.  That being said I still play it constantly.  Enjoy!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This author really has a way of taking the reader through an emotional rollercoaster. I hate him, I love him, he's sweet, he's an ass, crying, laughing.......all of it. The poetry in this is utterly amazing.  Definetely downloading book two right away!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Perfect.  Has all the features I wanted.  Nice soft leather.  It is a little bulkier and heavier than some but is very sturdy and has the rotating feature as well as the stand.  Can also hold your stylus pen.  Great value on sale from Amazon.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is awesome!!!!!!(as my title says) Sometimes it gets really hard but I figure it out.This game is great and I recommend it definitely!!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am addicted and read them one after another.<br />I'm on my 10th book (61 Hours) now. I hope Child<br />writes many more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I say this is a ok app and I think that if you are looking for a easy this may not be the app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWSOME !You should buy it! The graphics are .Take it from me,you won't regret buying this game!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie was really good and I couldn't believe the annimation, especially the tiger!  And all those Mercats! Plus I think Pi is really a beautiful man.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The storyline is well developed and controls easy to use. My only complaint is that sometimes I tap on the object and the game doesn't want to let me pick up the piece.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Now this movie requires several viewings and at times I had to repeat a sequence because I lost interest or fell asleep.  However, it is a subperb movie and I enjoy the many times I have viewed it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When I open minecraft the screen is black and if it's not black it present let my world load and when I look at my armor  it's red :-(
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|A really good story and so appropriate to the South and all of our history with domestic help.  Too bad the story could still be told in todays time. Maybe one day there will be no &#34;color&#34; barrier, but it's slow in coming.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I would not give it any stars as the app did not work for me at all. It would not allow me to enter my current username or password. I removed it from my device.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Tobey Maguire and Jeff Bridges are great in this movie.  The horse is the main character and all these other characters just support &#34;The Biscuit&#34;.  What  a great movie that will go down in the hall of classics.
B000001DVV|5.0|Its party rock at its best Im glad to see these guys are back with Stairway to Hell Im buying that too
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was disappointed in his prior book, but this made up it, by very clever writing and plotting. A real page turner. Bravo to Grisham for turning out a most entertaining crime novel.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great cast, great writing and great characters. Very compelling. Good for viewing many episodes in a row. Looks good on Kindle fire hd and even better streaming on prime on a big flat screen tv. A huge winner!
B000SZK41M|4.0|i like Bruce Willis and even though he liked this one better than the second one, i still think the second one's better.
B000FC2FVA|4.0|When you first hear this album, you need to realize that you are probably going to like it better & better after a few listens. Very tight, very subtle, enjoyable &#34;delicious&#34; music with seductive arrangements. The other reviewers are saying it better. You might want to listen to the Wolfgang Amadeus album which is more immediately accessible, and in my opinion a notch above this one. BTW, I would rate most group's work at 1 or 2 stars, so consider am rating this a 4.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Just a brilliant book! It's got all the geek flavors from video games to music to D&D! If you're a gamer, this is a book for you.
0316017922|4.0|I was really glad to find this at the price I did, because one of my friends had recommended this book. The only thing that I was disappointed about, was that there wasn't a dust jacket.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|I like old westerns, this movie was filmed in Moab Utah, Great Color and fun to watch the way movies were made. there is a great place at a ranch out in Moab that show pictures and tell about making the movie.<br />Great Quality Movie!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|The perfect blend of electronica and disco. Daft Punk makes its return loud and proud. Definitely pick this single up!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|just not what is needed on mobile.  to much information and pictures in to little space.  i would not recommend against it to others.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I like the game good graphics and great level ups but there is only so far you can go entill you really need to spend money otherwise a good game.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|this app is great for keeping close tabs on battery status.  i would highly recommend it to others,  i think it is great
B008Y7GSS4|5.0|Always enjoy watching this movie.  Seen it hella times now and it never gets old.  Good teen/romance/comedy whatever movie that is always enjoyable!
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|They look nothing like the ones on the screen shots for this app.<br />I downloaded this on Nexus 10 tablet.  This makes controlling very frustrating.  My thumb covers all the gas/break pedals so the game cannot tell what I want to do.  Is there a way to contact developer for a fix?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love it because  it is awesome and entertaining and it shows you what sharks sometimes have to do to stay alive and not starve to death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Excellent product, I can now use the Kinect system on a much smaller space. Easy to install on the Kinect.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|great information on backstories i did nto know. a must for anyone interested in the inside of politics, even thought this is just the very surface
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac-man never dies, never gets old. I love it! My childhood relived each time I play this classic. Back down memory lane!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|First book I've read by this author..loved it! Didn't want to put it down, enjoyed how the characters played off each other with their different personalities. The storyline was funny and serious, weaving in different issues that were relevant in that time period.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|it's a cute game. each animal will give a different amount of points while playing the game. it's a bit tricky and difficult to get enough points to make it to the next round sometimes. I'll sometimes go to the first round to get points and then move to the harder rounds to help earn enough points. it's addictive and fun.  (i got this app as Amazon's free of the the day) a while back. i have the galaxy s II.<br /><br />.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book is very informative. It was recommended by an instructor at an Arson Investigation class I was attending, and I can see why. The subtle clues a persons body gives while conversating is valuable when trying to find the truth about an event that typically destroys all the evidence. Strongly recommend this book.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I have this app on my Samsung Galaxy S II. it's really fun. it's also more difficult than I thought because it includes names of specific types/species of animals. Even the clothes category will have words that include materials that you might use to make clothes with or brand names of clothes that one may not have heard of. I haven't played the Xmas and winter category yet. Also it doesn't seem to keep the score you've earned after you exit out of the game :(.  but I really like this game and was playing the game until my battery was about to die out. lol! ( I had gotten this while it was Amazon's Free App of the Day). but it' s seems worth the 99 cents.
0385344228|2.0|I do not understand how over 1,000 reviewers gave this book 5 stars.  It's plodding,<br />redundant, superficial, illogical and really quite shallow.  I tried valiantly -- after<br />all the raves -- to 'get into' it but just didn't find it compelling or worthy of any<br />more than 2.0 stars.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This handy little app does all sorts of timely things. They are obvious from the title and they are all easy to use. I am always losing my kitchen timers and if I just look at the clock I am never precise. However, my Kindle is always with me so now my timer is, too.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|Great casting and the characters are very believable. The special effects are top notch, exactly what you would expect froma movie like this..
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app tells you everything you would want to know about your battery. It tells you the percentage of energy left, of course. It also tells you exactly how much battery life you have left if you use any specific application. It will let you know how much time you have if you are on the web, reading a book, listening to music and a bunch of others. It is especially helpful if you are watching a movie. You will know for sure you have enough juice to see the entire movie.<br /><br />It also tells how long it will take to recharge using either USB or AC adapter.<br /><br />Very handy.
B00005QEO2|5.0|I love this album because it has different songs from four albums on it - DONE WITH MIRRORS (1985), PERMANENT VACATION(1987), PUMP (1989) and GET A GRIP(1993) - and it shows how their musical style has evolved, yet still remained true to their rockin' bluesy sound. These guys definitely take the phrase \\"Let The Music Do The Talking\\" and run wild with it. All killer, no filler! This is a solid rocker from start to finish!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love that there is no time limit .  The puzzles are challenging and fun  the graphics are colorfully and pleasing to the eye.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The first half of this book was the sweetest love story and then the second half has the biggest twist. I was not expecting it. I literally could not breath when the twist came about. I love when books can draw you in and then shock the heck out of you. This book did that and did a great job with it. I could have never predicted what was going to happen in this book. The only thing I was disappointed in was the end. I wish there would've been a look into the future to see how the characters are. They go through so much in this story and I just wanted to know that down the road they were still going to be ok. But besides that the ending was still good and the book was AMAZING!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app.  It allows me to make notes at any time, while I'm thinking about it.  It beats paper and pencil notes that get lost.  A great thing for me.
1476719071|5.0|Going into this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. But after the first two chapters I could not put it down. I fell in love with Travis. He is not my type (in real life) but I've never been so attracted to a fictional character. A lot of people feel that Travis is crazy and has too many anger issues, which he does. But what I loved about his character is that he is broken, messed up and far from perfect. I was so tired of reading books where the main character is attractive, smart, heroic and so put together. I loved that he was a mess half the time. It made him feel more real. I loved his charm, passion and even his aggression at times. I feel like the characters grew in this story. They still have a long way to go. Travis and Abby's main problem is their lack of communication. If they stated how they truly felt all the time there wouldn't be all of the pent up feelings and tension but this also added to the sexual tension and chemistry between them. Overall I loved this book. It's not your typical romance. These characters have obstacles to overcome. Their far from being the perfect couple but that's what makes them a beautiful disaster. It was a fun, entertaining and sexy read. Loved every minuted of it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books contain the kind of detail that I require in my reading.  They combine drama, mystery, betrayal and a multitude of characters.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is my favorite book of 2012. I had no idea what to expect when I read this book. I completely fell in love with the story. I could talk about this book forever. I loved that the story dealt with so many human emotions. This book captured falling in love, heartbreak, death and forgiveness. I laughed out loud, cried and smiled all throughout this book. Lake and Will are heart melting. I loved that Will was such a mature man. At 21 years old he had to handle so much. Everything from school, work, raising his brother, paying bills etc. And he still managed to be the best \\"book boyfriend\\" I've ever read. I loved Lake so much. I loved her attitude, wittiness and her vulnerability. I loved that both main characters were so strong. I loved the poetry in this story. PHENOMENAL. I felt as if I were watching the slams in person as I read them. I love everything Colleen Hoover has written so far. Keep up the amazing work!!!
0399243860|4.0|You won't use it for long, but all of his books are good for very young kids learning the basics.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As much as i enjoyed the continuation of this tale, i kept wanting more. I recommend having the next volume at hand so you don't have to wait to keep reading.
B00005JM02|4.0|Fifty dollars is excessive for any children's movie, but this a difficult find so I paid it. My friend loves the movie and couldn't find the DVD anywhere. If you're buying for someone who will be thrilled with it, go for it ... otherwise, nothing about it stands out from any other DVD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed the action-packed climax of the war, loved the thought-provoking aftermath. This is not just another color-by-numbers pap for the masses.
0448444216|5.0|You won't use it for long, but all of his books are good for young kids learning the basic skills.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Movie was a little slow but I'm a shoot em up kind of guy. Photog was beautiful.  Was well done.
0694013013|5.0|You won't use it for long, but all of his books are good for young kids learning the basic skills.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Boring is all I can say. So I guess in order to give this review I have to say more about this boring game. I froze on me
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|A terrific biopic and view of the fight to make the movie Psycho.  Good characterizations reveal the importance of Hitch's wife.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Family entertainment! A nice mix of science fiction with some occasional historical facts thrown in for those who are sharp enough to catch them. Entertaining for most ages.
0780021150|5.0|beautiful picture quality  Great movie! Peter Lorrie is amazing in his ability to express emotion in his action and facial expression.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|The good: Many bible version and reading plans to keep you on track.<br /><br />The bad: must be connected to the internet to use this app :-( Would rate higher if you could do your daily reading plan and then sync whenever it connected to internet.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I for imagine that if Conan-Doyle had been alive in the 20th crush, these are the stories he would have written - he would endorse then at the very least
B003YL4LYI|4.0|On par with book 2, and almost as good 3.  Much better than book 4.  It stays true to the style of writing, but you will have to wait for book 6 :-/
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I for imagine that if Conan-Doyle had been alive in the 20th crush, these are the stories he would have written - he would endorse then at the very least.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|The world building is well-researched and creative. The adventure is fast paced. However, the characters are only good, not great. I would have liked to see the noble side of Josh--mostly he complained and sasses people. And I'd have liked to get into the head and heart of some of the immortal helpers of the twins. They weren't super-relatable. But it was fun to read and I'll read the second book.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Archer is a master storyteller and his insight into human nature,considering the environment in which they function gives it superb credibility.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this app it is a good app to just sit and past time with. Also I &hearts; the new save me thing GOOD APP
B0064BWDRW|4.0|In spite of all his drawbacks and frailties ,he still manages to get to the bottom of it all Rathet surprise ending
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's like grand theft auto but better and a little bit harder and more fun and cooler and with more things and things to do
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow! Completely not the ending I expected! Hard to put down with all of the twists and turns along the way, defending Jacob. Great writing and definitely a must read!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Not real hard to put down, but keeps me guessing as the plot thickens.<br />I like Jack, good character, not too perfect!
0385361661|5.0|I'm a Sophie fan and she has managed to give us another book full of quirky but fabulous characters that you have to love.
B0002XDODU|5.0|If you are a fan of heavy metal, but aren't really into screamo this is a great band and CD. Rammstein combines awesome instrumental work with Tills great vocal control that makes for a outstanding hard metal band.
1402766904|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It is annotated. I purchased it as a gift to another Dicken's lover and will probably do the same for myself.
B004SDEP38|2.0|I downloaded this app and don't see any different on my tablet<br />I am very disappointed in this app. sorry to say.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|I will mimic other reviews by starting with how fun this game could be.  You navigate different sized vehicles through various obstacle courses while avoiding contact with the sides of the course or other vehicles. There is a slider on the left side of the screen for steering; and forward, reverse, and stop buttons on the right side to control movement.<br /><br />For the first few levels these controls seem fairly intuitive as you make small turns through short levels.  As the difficulty progresses, however, and you start struggling through sharp turns through narrow alleyways, you realize the major flaw that makes this game impossible to continue: it doesn't support multi-touch.<br /><br />At any given point while controlling your vehicle, you may either be pressing forward or reverse, or steering the vehicle, but never both at the same time. And since the vehicle continues to move forward while you are struggling with a sharp turn, you will inevitably hit something and be forced to start the level over.<br /><br />If the developers ever fix this gaping flaw in their otherwise enjoyable game, then I will gladly re-rate this to a five.  Until then, I'll just be glad that I got it as a daily free app, and delete it instantly from my phone.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I have bought it twice now and I still haven't got it downloaded on my tablet<br />I am very disappointed in  this app.  after buying it twice I would think one of<br />them would have worked
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty good. keeps your attention for a while. probably not the type of game you play for hours; but good for a bit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Filled with adventure and love.  Watching katnis and peers fall in love kept me on the edge of my sweet.

B00CDT41RY|2.0|if it wasnt for the main white guy would gave it 1 star waste of time jamie fox boring as always
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Hard to believe Jake Bugg is 19 years old!! He writes like he has done a lot of living in his 19 years.  Had heard the first 2 songs on the radio; rest of the album does not disappoint.  My current CD in the car for when I'm driving!  And it will be there on the way to Memphis to see him at the Beale Street Music Festival.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was expecting this to be just some freaky novel, but I was surprised to find it was a total love story. I felt this story represented many levels of realistic relationship struggles. I laughed outloud, I cried, and I fell in love with Fifty!
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I thought Meryl Streep did a Great job of playing the role. She is an excellent character actor and along with her husband's Performance... I was very impressed. There was a lot of things in her personal life, Especially towards the end, that I had not realized Were part of her life.

B00AO686MY|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out, and just wanted to make sure it was in my collection. Being blu-ray is an added plus!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. I heard all the talk of how great it was. I had to see for myself. Now I can't wait for the next season.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love the drama and tension in season 1. The characters are great and the main one develops well into a more mature, moral inclined biker.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Works great and its nice that you can add your own preset timers.Especially since it was free.Thanks Amazon App Store
B004U8VX2M|4.0|Love this series and Amazon Prime. I love being able to stream in great movies and  my favorite television series.<br />Thank you Amazon.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun game. Brings me back to Super Mario brothers days. My children love this game as well. I would def recommend it :)

B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Have been following Fast Diet for 5 weeks, lost 10 pounds. Easy to follow, fast days are easy now and I make better choices on regular days. I don't resist my guilty pleasures on non fast days but I do try to reduce my amounts.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I love the Jesse Stone books, and have really enjoyed all the Jesse Stone movies that Tom Selleck has made. Now in his 60's, Tom has still &#34;got it&#34;. The scenery/setting of the movie is well-chosen to fit the mood. The music is perfect. Having read the books and seen most of the movies, I can understand the choice of Tom Selleck to play Jesse Stone. When I read one of the books now, I can hear Selleck in my mind saying the words. Although the movies do not completely follow the book, mainly due to time constraints, they are true to the character created by Robert Parker.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am so thankful Sheryl Sandberg took the time to write her story. I know a few girls in high school and this book is their graduation present. It is so encouraging as well as empowering. Because of this book I'm moving forward to start my own business with confidence. Men & women would both be enspired by this book.
1476734941|4.0|The science for the diet makes sense.I wish that authors would stop trying to fill in their health books with recipes and calorie charts.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story was fun and had enough twists to keep my interest.  It was another of the \\"not the usual\\" John Grisham.  (Calico Joe, Playing for Pizza)  I recommend it with 4 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large numbers and the ease of use.  I have tried 7 or 8 others and this is by far the best. It's great that it shows you your last entry and if it happen to time out it will remember where you were. Great app!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A film doesn't win 5 Academy Awards for naught!!!!<br />Robert Parker is totally awesome and the ocean scenes are positively overwhelming.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I use this app a lot on my computer and was glad to find that it was available for my Kindle Fire.  It works great.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|A bit long for my liking which I thought detracted from the ending. But in all it was a good read.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Liked this Daniel Craig as Bond film the best so far. Javier Bardem as the villain is brilliant. Too bad about Judi Dench, though.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Each epidode has a well scripted story. There is a gripping story thst runs through the entire season. Good casting for both major and minor roles.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book on a weekend girls getaway and couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the characters right away. I have passed my hard copy around to several girlfriends who also couldn't put it down. Housework falling to the wayside.  Then because my book was being passed around and I was missing the characters so much I bought the e-book for my Kindle. Now I have Travis and Abby just a finger tap away.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|if you like vampires, werewolf's and any other kind of monsters set  in today times, you'll enjoy this show. two brother hunters sloving cases of the unknown.

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I think this app is a little stereotype with sharks because sharks doesn't mean to eat fish and humans...... it is the instinct they have to eat.....
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love Castle, and it gets even better during this season. True, I would like it to show a little more &#34;action&#34; between Castle and Beckett, but I like how they each have to deal with their own insecurites in their relationship. I can't believe the season's almost over.
B0065GC0PG|4.0|What a great twist on a familiar story line. The author had you rooting for Cinder and the prince, Kai.  This Syfy adventure was captivating leaving you hanging on for the next book in the series, Scarlet. This YA tale was a great read for teens and all lovers of this genre.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|While it's made for more than one-player, it's still a cute and challenging game. However, it does get a bit repetitive.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|Getting tired of Will Smith always yelling in his movies and trying to portray the wanna-be tough, poor me Black man.  The special effects are excellent in this movie and the plot to the story is good.  However, I felt as if this film could've done itself more justice by adding an extra half hour to give a bit more detail in explaining itself better.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|really good book I recommend this because it's a good story<br />To read when your bored or something like that.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love listening to this album, it's so so good.<br /><br />You should buy it and it will change your life.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I love this game so much it allows me to be free and draw anything I want. also I can use my own picture!
0425263908|3.0|Although I did enjoy this story I feel the author moved things way to quickly. It just felt like things were rushed and this could have been a 500 page book easily. For example, they are together and in love within a matter of days even after Eva claimed she wasn't going to be someones walking vagina. Their \\"stormy\\" fights only last 30 seconds (which to me is really unrealistic considering what they are fighting about sometimes) making Eva look like a spineless fool. The last thing that bugged me was nothing was ever answered about Gideon in this book. She could have at least thrown us a scrap of something! All that said, even though these things bugged me I still enjoyed the book and is why I gave it three stars.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|My brother begged me to get this app, so I did.... it is not fun at all! All you do is not try to get hit by these object-thingies and get coins. I know it's free, but don't waste your time getting it! Or taking up storage on your devices! I hope you found this helpful! Please don't get it! I shouldn't have!!!:'(!!!<br /><br />P.s. DON'T GET IT!!!!:p
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really wanted this second book to be better than the first but again it just didn't really do it for me completely. The back in forth I hate you I love you became way too much and took up the majority of this book. I feel a little bit lost with him being a dominate. IT seemed like she was going to take the book in that direction, but then its hardly ever brought up and I never see any REAL dominating going on. It could just be me but I don't consider a man that is over protective and jealous a dominate, a dominate displays his dominance in the bedroom. There is still multiple unanswered questions which I am assuming the author is saving for the third book so she has a third book. This book made be lose all respect for Eva and then the turn this series is now taking by what Gideon does is just ridiculous. All I can say is REALLY? IT does deserve three stars though because it did keep me interested.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Kept me interested the entire time I was reading. Recommend to any who likes a good mystery. David Baldacci is good.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone written by Ishmael Beah was a well-written book that demonstrates how war definitely impacts a person's life. In this case it was about the experiences that Ishmael experienced throughout his life; not only did he did he try to avoid the rebels, but he, along with many other boys, witnessed death first hand. The impacts of war are felt within every citizen due to all the raping of women and children, killing, and torture. This book truly demonstrates the impacts of globalization and the consequences it brings to innocent people. While reading this book I managed to learn so many new information that is not talked about or in our textbooks. It is amazing how much occurs without half of the population knowing about it. I honestly had no idea a place called Sierra Leone existed, but with the help of Ishmael I became a person with greater knowledge. It is amazing how a person can survive these horrific experiences and make a better person of them. I would completely recommend this book to everyone; it will be a book that you will not be able to put down because as you read you can also see the experiences that Ishmael lived through.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very well written book by Davis Baldacci. Enjoyed to entire book. Recommend to anyone who likes David Baldacci. Well done.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|A LITTLE TOO MUCH, TOO LATE<br /><br />This generation may well have rated this as &#34;Best Picture&#34; but for those of us who remember the incident only too well the movie appeared to be &#34;doctored up&#34; in traditional Hollywood fashion, found it somewhat boring and would not watch it again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Like all Jeff Kinney Wimpy Kid books my son got through this very quickly..he said he likes them because they are not fake...seem true to life.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I have never seen Denzel Washington in a bad movie, and I love his acting and ability to bring such realism to the screen and take the audience into his characters world.<br /><br />This movie was based on a true story and I had the rare privilege of meeting the man upon whose own personal experience this movie was produced and directed.<br /><br />The reason Idid not give it a 5 star rating is  (like all hollywood dramatists) much was added to the story, much was also deleted, overall Ifound it to be most entreating and captivating.
030758836X|5.0|I was really impressed with this very unique novel.  What an interesting read!  Plot twists like you won't believe.  It will go fast, believe me.
B007REV4T8|2.0|As an avid fan of James Bond Movies for the last half century, I could not ever recommend this movie to my worst enemy, i loved all the Ian Fleming novels and characters but this one was so far, far removed from any semblance entertainment I personally was bored out of my gore.<br /><br />Now let me empathize that when these movies are produced and directed, many actors get work, and possibilities open for struggling performing artists, so in that respect (for my own love of the artistic community) I say thank you for giving work to many of us.
B009K86D86|4.0|This movie, although a few years old, really challenges us to think about what we eat and how those decisions impact corporate America.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Wonderful!!!
B001LRJH0K|1.0|I found this movie was just plain bad, so bad I had to keep watching in horror at the money spent in it's creation.  By the midpoint my opinion had sunk to \\"pathetically bad\\"... and half an hour from the end, when my wife asked if I still thought it pathetic, I found it had torpedoed \\"pathetically bad\\" and was continuing to sink.  My main gripe: P*R*E*D*I*C*T*A*B*L*E!  From the first two minuted I knew what was going to happen before it happened.  I knew how the movie would end ten minutes in!  The script... arrgh, the script... I can't even call it a script.  It was a roll of toilet paper.  The acting... was on vacation.  I think Viggo and Ed can act; the jury has never returned on Zellweger.  Jeremy Irons must have been offered a trainload of gold bullion to climb aboard this carcass.  The leftover change was spent on the set and photography - those looked excellent.  But pretty pictures and realistic locations and the unrealized promise of good acting can't save this film.  I'm not hating on Westerns as a genre - it's just that this is really really bad, and I want anyone who has a single doubt to save their money for something that will actually deliver enjoyment.  Unless you enjoy doing a post-mortem on a cinematic corpse that's left in the sun too long.<br /><br />ps.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  Shame on me for the 2.5 hours I'll never get back.
B0064MPXFA|1.0|Started out good got held hostage by political hot button issues...for that is. It was a total let down for me.
B00BV2LY1U|2.0|Warning \\"Spoiler Alert\\".  This Review contains discussions of the story line.  Don't read this review unless you don't mind having the storyline being revealed.<br /><br />David Baldacci is an author that came recommended by an acquaintance and Zero Day is my initiation to his stories.  I would like to say that I enjoyed it like the majority of the reviewers on Amazon, but I can not.  Zero Day was a big disappointment for me.  The story plot was thin and poorly executed.  The characters were rather flat and underdeveloped.  I don't mind that John Puller's career seems to resembles Jack Reacher's career (Lee Child).  Jack Reacher can't be the only military or ex-military investigator roaming the United States of America.  However, John Puller seems to fail to live up to his reputation of being a consummate military investigator of a specialized unit.  He arrives in Drake, West Virginia and bumbles around town conducting a rather haphazard investigation (opposed to a methodical and thorough one) with a female cop, Sam Cole, who seems dumbfounded every time Puller makes an observation.  Every other scene (I'm being facetious) seems to feature Puller and Cole eating a meal at The Crib, (a local eatery).  Puller's interviews are very brief consisting of one or two questions.  Puller allows other people or events to drive his investigation.  For example,  Puller comes back from Washington D.C. after a meeting with Homeland Security with knowledge that he has less than 3 days to prevent a catastrophic event, yet he allows Jean Trent, Sam Cole's sister drive him a county or two away from Drake to take him to lunch to ask him one or two questions.  I also  found it hard to believe that a one star general would allow the murder victim, Colonel Reynolds to conduct an investigation into something that fell outside the parameters of his job without knowing something tangible about the concern.  The one star general was not able to pinpoint or articulate the cause for concern orsuspicion was which I find unbelievable yet somehow authorized Reynolds to take time away from his assignment to investigate an ambiguous and seemingly unsupported suspicion? I don't buy it.  The facts of the situation were presented throughout the story enough for Puller to put together a suspicion of criminal intent  involving the contents of the abandoned nuclear site, much earlier in the story than he finally took an interest in during the last quarter of the book, but Puller was very slow on the uptake of the situation.  I truly do not understand what influence Puller had in keeping his superiors from sending in bomb disposal teams to dispose of the nuclear device & materials.  The army is not a democratic agency and Puller's rank would not have lent him to having sway over higher authority.  Puller is not an experienced bomb expert and Sam Cole was way out of her league in assisting Puller.  He did her a great injustice in allowing her to be present at the nuclear site.  Finally,  the author does the reader a disservice, by John Puller's long winded explanation of how he figured out that Mason was part of the deadly plot rather than taking the time to develop the story in a way that armchair detectives could have figured out Mason's involvement.  Sorry, but this story \\"bombed\\".
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|The plot is great suspenseful and I just love Bruce. The ending seemed a bit weak but then I don't want to see my hero Bruce...oops don't want to give away the ending.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I guess I'm not into a movie with no dialog at all, just singing. The costumes and backdrops where very good though.
0817439390|5.0|This book does a great job bridging the gap for the new photographer wishing to advance their skills. Highly recommend!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The caption above says most of it. The series includes a broad spectrum of characters from aristocracy to the scullery maids drawn with an eye to the human characteristics of each person in a believable, engrossing and sympathetic manner. A masterful achievement.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Could not be happier with this processor. It blows my old AMD out of the water, especially with my new SSD!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I want a complete package of 3d, blu ray and DVD. This is a stripped-down version. I will never buy an other Disney film until this is sold as it should. Shame on Disney Greed!
032147404X|5.0|A great book for beginners. Sure, some people complained about Scott's playful nature, and he does ramble a little from time to time, but his advice and experience is amazing and he does a great job breaking down the basics. I highly recommend this book!
B001TODCII|3.0|Taken is an enjoyable film for what it is.  The plot is nothing new.  Many other action films have similar plots like Commando.  So, it all comes down to how well and different it is executed.  I think Taken is executed fairly decently.  Though, this is mainly due to Liam Neeson and his performance, like in the famous telephone scene.  Without Neeson, this movie would not be nearly as enjoyable.<br /><br />The acting is alright.  No one did a bad job performance wise.  The only character worth talking about is Bryan Mills, played by Liam Neeson.  He is very likable, very driven, and kicks ass.  There are times were he comes off very mean and extreme.  However, I still liked him as a character, because of his situation.  I'm glad he came out on top in the end.  The rest of the characters are bland.  Maggie Grace's character is the typical teenage girl that gets kidnapped.  I did kind of feel for her, but not much, because I barely got to know her.  Famke Janssen, I did not care for at all.  She did nothing, and was very mean throughout most of the film.  The villains, I thought, were kind of nothing villains.  I did not find them intimidating.<br /><br />The film does move at a good pace.  The action scenes are fun and well-choreographed.  The final fight I really enjoyed.<br /><br />Overall this is a generic, but fun action movie.  Its saving grace is definitely Liam Neeson and his character.  I recommend this to people who are fans of action movies.  Those who are not fans of action films, I would skip this.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I put off buying this album for a long time, but it is totally worth the purchase price for the MP3 version.  &#34;Dog Days are Over&#34; is transcendent and all the non-single tracks are really good too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Living in Venezuela and reading this book is like a travel in time to a hopeless future. Fully recommendable. The film is finally next.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson surely is the best nautical writer who did exist! Treasure Island, one of the best novels ever written by a human!
B00BU18U82|4.0|Love the game and the pc version but would like to see more stuff and willing to pay for it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|great extras great packaging geat movies. worth the buy. i love the case its so awsome its a little book with the disks in it really great.
B004XZDT60|5.0|i got this album months before it hit the US. Big fan after watching him win BEST MALE SINGER on the BRIT AWARDS.<br />The album has a tone that weaves through out the cd. It will be fun to hear different styles with that beautiful voice.<br />Ed Sheeran is the Brit's Jason Mraz.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|For all Dr. Who fans this ias a must! I love watching the series over again. The story line is fantastic.
B004L03B3S|5.0|The subject matter is a little more than racy....but all the actors and the writing is really superb.<br />This is probably one of the best gay themed movies I have seen.<br />The directing was excellent and it was filmed beautifully.
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|love this album, must have for long car rides or working at home! so many favorites (scream and shout, #thatpower)!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It seemed a little slow to start but as it continued it drew me deeper in.  I enjoy stories set in this time period and this one didn't disappoint. I highly recommend this book and plan to read more of this authors work.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|slow and lack luster and could of been much better. More effort was needed to give it more stars in this review.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I got this as the FAOTD. GlaI I didn't pay for it. I play one level and it freezes on the nextt.  Ihave to shut it down and start it again to be able to play the next level i
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I really wish Justin Timberlake would get better friends to help him produce his album. Timbaland has no concept of what music is; he just coughs on the track and calls it a beat. I hope JT's future albums will be better produced. There are tons of really great producers out there that would really take JT's albums to the next level. Collaborate with someone like Adrian Younge or even Danger Mouse if you want an album to sound good.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It has a nice story. It's also pretty funny at some points. I definitely recommend it. Especially if you have prime, you have nothing to lose.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I've yet to read the books, but this series is a powerhouse of strong characters, sweeping stories and great acting. A must-watch.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Thought it would be interesting but just too slow to start to keep my interest and whole movie was so dark and grainy. The actors were good movies was just analytical. I have tried to watch it three times have yet to make it past the first 45 minutes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought this book was an easy read; I was sucked into it right away and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The next weekend we rented the movie and I was disappointed at how much they changed the story. I should have known, as always the book was better!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I am sure there was much depth to this, but I was warned it was pretty slow and still I ventured on.  I love history but this was a snooze!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Towards the end of the book the sequence of events leading up to the climax  are not well thought out or reasonable.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|I love this movie I've seen it before a number of times I love to see more movies like this
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The first in a Trilogy that will lead up to where the &#34;LORD OF RINGS&#34; series began, this tells the backstory and beginnins of Bilbo's tale which would ultimately lead to Frodo's adventures many years later. I highly recommend the blu-ray 3D version if you have the capability to watch 3D (which I do) but even the DVD version is well worth the watch, as this brings back many of the original characters from &#34;LORD OF THE RINGS&#34; and also introduces many new ones, including Gimly's father, who is part of the 13 adventurers in this tale. I can't wait for the next part to come out, which is now scheduled for sometime next year.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I wanted to read this book before it gets made into a film, which if you read the papers, is about to happen.<br />Its brilliant - You have to stick with it though, we're kept waiting by the author for the hook  - once its in however there is no getting away.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|I just sat down and watched this last night and it was great. It's and updated remake of an old Nick Nolte film called &#34;MULHOLLAND FALLS&#34; and they brought back Nick to play the Police Chief behind the squad in this one with Josh Brolin playing his old part. This has an Outstanding cast that includes, Nick Nolte, Josh Brolin, Emma Stone, Ryan Gossling, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi, & Michael Pena & the great Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen. The story is based on a real life story that occurred in 1949 in Los Angeles and although parts of it are fictionalized the action is great and doesn't dissapoint. If you like Gangster movies then this one should be added to your list.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Not your average book, a  brilliant, quirky, compulsive read. A great story bought alive by fascinating characters. I loved it!
B003B02O3C|5.0|This book contained the elements of humor (at times I found myself laughing outloud), education, indignation, and helpless frustration as to how the legal system works, My favorite Grisham book.
B001TH16DS|1.0|First, if you're a TOS fan, please excuse me, and ignore my review.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you haven't watched much Star Trek, or have, but haven't watched TOS (The Original Series -- the thing I'm reviewing), this review is for you.<br /><br />I used to watch TOS a long time ago, then switched to TNG (The Next Generation, with Captain Picard) and never looked back. After a half-decade of TNG, DS9 (Deep Space 9), Voyager and a bit of Enterprise, I wanted to give TOS a shot again, and see if I would like it, or if it was as bad as I remembered.<br /><br />I should not have.<br /><br />TOS was created in the 60s, and looks dated now, with the huge oversized knobs, no touch screens, the dark interiors, the dismal corridors, the garish red paint on the bridge, and the electronic devices that are almost as big as the Chromebook I'm writing this on.<br /><br />Sci-fi set in the past does not resonate (unless you're into steampunk and similar stuff). When you find yourself looking down on a starship and associated technology that in some ways is behind ours (no touchscreens!), it destroys the effect. Even TNG looks a bit dated now, in places, but TOS, far more so. The effects, the decor, the look of things... the awe and futuristic feel are gone.<br /><br />The old Enterprise looks ugly and too angular, not streamlined or elegant at all, compared to Enterprise D or E.<br /><br />I much prefer Picard to Kirk. Kirk is a bit of an alpha male. Which is fine, but I much prefer the intellectual, cultured approach of Picard, if I may call it that.<br /><br />Ultimately, every work is a product of its time, and it's hard to transcend that. TOS's days are over, I'm sad to report. Try TNG.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun &quot;city&quot; building game for all ages. So far one of the few that does not rely on cash purchases as much as most. Story with it is also really cute.
B00BESM14U|5.0|What a GEM of a movie.<br /><br />This is a must watch and a must buy for your collection. These young actors and actresses are ones to watch out for in the future just an overall well done movie.
B002TVQ4HG|1.0|I thought this would be a good movie after reviewing the reviews...but after buying it and watching it I realised I should have read the two stars and below reviews. Don't waste tour money - just rent it or watch on TV.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This book series is phenomenal. I cannot put my Kindle down.  I read every free moment that I can. You will not be disappointed.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This movie touches the hardest of hearts, it is an inspiration to all to understand those that are different from us.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is really well done. The 3D graphics are awesome and the puzzles are unique. It's not overly challenging, but hard enough to keep you engaged. It also has a nice hint feature, which points you in the right direction, but doesn't give away the answer, if you don't want it. My only complaint is that the game ended too quickly. I would love to have played longer.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like it, and my husband is hooked on the show! Good stories each week.  Well done. Interesting.  Do watch it!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I read this based on John Green's recommendation, as he's my favorite YA author! He was right! I loved EP for everything 90's, everything of your first love, and everything imperfect about the characters. I finished in one night because Rowell writes you into the pages, you can't escape the sweet story of Eleanor and her brokenness, and Park with his inner secrets. One of my favorites!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A quick read, the perfect way to start my holiday reading. Such insightful observations _ I now look at a few friends and family through different eyes!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|they rock they are the best product was awesome Movie was wonderful I will recommend this to others The quality was great
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like Jillian Michael's workouts. This one is simple enough for anyone to do but challenging enough to provide results.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a stirring example of reality that can hit any one of us at any time. What would YOU do in a time of tragedy? What if it were YOUR family? Watch this. You won't regret it. Turn your phones off. Have tissues available.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I had heard a lot about this movie. I like to wait and purchase popular movies and watch them at home instead of seeing them in theaters. This was available for a nice price. It also arrived earlier than expected. As for the movie, it was very attention grabbing and entertaining.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|It is great that you can order a movie online now and see it when you want to instead of waiting for it to come out to the video store. Makes entertainment so much easier.
B0044XV3QY|2.0|when i ordered, i was thinking i was getting a good deal, but when i got it... to the disbelief of my very eyes.. i got my dvd with best buy stickers all over it..<br /><br />i think i should have looked elsewhere for a good deal..

B001P4ESGC|5.0|Especially, if you are a huge Glen Close fan.  I love watching her in this role. Highly recommend.  Warning, it is addictive, so if you have to arise early, don't watch it before you go to bed.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Entertaining, but I guess the book was better according to those who have read the book and seen the movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Truly amazing film. Hadn't read the book before and now I'm kicking myself for it. Loved it! Could watch over and over.
0061692034|5.0|I had to read this for a book club and I am very glag I did. It is a novel appraoch to turning points in people's lives. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|What can I say others haven't already? If you're looking for a good &#34;western set in outer space and on various planets&#34; you can't do better than Firefly.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love the Game of Thrones series, and I only gave this book a 4 because it didn't end like I wanted! I am not usually a fan of fantasy, but this series hooked me in. I hope book 6 comes out soon.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Having seen the hurt locker, I thought this might be kind if the same movie. It was more thrilling and intense and worth the ride. Watch it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My children play this on my Kindle and they love it.  It can be addicting though.  They tell me it is &#34;awesome&#34;.  As for me, I'm really not coordinated to beat the monkeys :).
B00APUYN0I|4.0|The music selections and a couple of very funny little touches help it to rise above the standard plot lines.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is not downloading and I have enough money for it please help I would much approach it very well
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Just finished Season 3......just when I think it can't get any better it does.  This is a very well written series.  Great character development.  Highly recommend.
B000SEFDP0|5.0|Second reading after 15 years or so. Came with a much greater understanding, while simultaneously inspiring countless more mysteries. I suppose I'll have to revisit the 'Leif Erickson' one more time in another 15 years and see if I've solved any of the new mysteries, and discover if there are any more waiting for me in the Twilight.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is an amazing book by an awesome author. Good series, highly recommended. Can't wait to read the next books.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|If you happen to have a family with some crazy in it, you will feel right at home in this movie. If your family doesn't have any crazy in it, well you are lying to yourself, but this is still a movie worth your time.<br /><br />Oh and Jennifer Lawrence...
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is Very nice..It is durable,fashionable and it is of great quality as well.I recommend purchasing it. I am very happy with it.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie and like all John Williams scores, this one defines the film.  Also prefer the digital download - no plastic or paper waste.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved every single minute!  I have become a Dan Brown fan for life. I will read every single book that he writes!
B00190OHD6|4.0|Story line was not run-of-the-mill.<br />No vile language saturation.<br />Who knew Gerard Butler could be so funny!  Delightful character.<br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan:  wow!
B00AE2KZNQ|4.0|Do you like violence? Watch it!<br />Do you like history? Watch it!<br />Do you like romance? Watch it!<br />Do you appreciate great acting? Watch it!<br />Do you enjoy unintentional humor? Watch it!<br />Do you prefer a script you can quote in any given situation? Watch it!<br /><br />This movie is everything you'd want to see. Nevermind the so-called \\"plot holes\\" or \\"lingering questions\\" in the storyline other reviews complain about. You don't need the bottom line of each detail to dig into this movie. Couples can watch, men can watch, women can watch, and all can enjoy. The only limit to this film is that it's absolutely not for children, and that's not a bad thing. It's a good-time flick for grown people. No disappointment whatsoever. One of my absolute favorite films!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times read this series the emotion is the same. I love this book and the beginning memorial story. Full of sadness, courage, and love.
B008VBYN80|3.0|ok not to great,  just like other free games where you have to pay to grow faster. but its ok
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Many liked this and thought it funny. It is a great kids movie, but no where near as entertaining from us &#34;big kids&#34; like the Shrek movies were.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|The how to play instructions weren't clear; had to play with it several times to figure it out.  My granddaughter got bored with it pretty quickly.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|I felt like I was watching a soft porn flick and then it turned into a horror flick. It was awful and awkward and I am glad I didn't sit and watch it with my teenagers. The story line was BORING.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Would read other work by this author.<br />Very nice read. Could place myself looking over the cliffs. Enjoyed the story lines.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|i dont think its that bad but it starts to get really challenging for me and its just super hard
030758836X|3.0|Great read after about half way through, but didn't care for the ending after such a build-up. Would not want to be married to any of the ladies in the storey.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Same as always,<br /><br />Good reading to the end.  Jack Reacher has made a place in my brain for reading and keeping me going to the end.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise and generally avoid his films but I'm glad that I made an exception this time for \\"Oblivion\\".  This film featured a good story with several plot twists and generally kept my interest throughout.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A little slow at first while setting up the story. But WOW, once Holder is introduced, I couldn't put it down.  Had so many twists and turns I didn't see coming.  A must read.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great story.  Great filming.  Great sound track for those with a home theatre system.  So sad this show only lasted one season.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|This movie was disturbing and very hard to watch. Parts of it were clever and amusing, but not enough to outweigh the ridiculous amounts of bloody violence, foul language, and human misery.  Do yourself a favor and pick a different movie.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Cute game.  Not bad at all. For a free game.  I love the graphics and of coarse the animals.  Very laid back stress free playing.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a must see movie.  I cried and laughed, I don't usually hang on to movies to watch over, but this one is definately a keeper.  Well done.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|This movie was better and worse than I expected.<br /><br />One the one hand, it's pretty much a no apologies action flick. I normally not all that crazy about action movies, but this one had enough &#34;meat on the bones&#34; that it actually turned out surprisingly well.<br /><br />On the other hand, Mark Wahlberg, Levon Helm, and even Danny Glover and Ned Beatty have all proven themselves to be better actors than this movie requires, so I thought it might actually rise above itself into greatness. Not so much.<br /><br />Its main problems seem to be some wooden dialogue, some arbitrary plot twists, and a worn out genre with nothing really new in the offing to keep us engaged.<br /><br />There is one thing that makes me wonder though, about the director's original vision. Levon Helm.<br /><br />Though Levon's appearance in the movie is pretty brief, his performance is stellar, especially when considering that some of the lines he has to deliver are not only wooden, but rough cut wood. The thing is - there are a few things he does in his brief appearance that hint at a deeper plot that ended up on the editing room floor. Granted, I haven't researched it enough to know; there may be a director's cut, or the DVD/Blu-Ray may contain the cut scenes. Honestly, the movie didn't inspire enough passion in me to find out.<br /><br />All in all, I'd watch it again, and it might even make it onto my list of favorites - the long list, not the short one.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really liked this book, I will definitely read it again because, and I am not embarrassed to admit this, some things just went right over my head. The love story was sad but in one of those, \\"ok, that sucked, but I think I'm ok with it\\", ways.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Such a wonderful blessing to enjoy.  Get your bible and look for all of God's principles concerning forgiveness, encouragement, love, abiding, friendship, prayer, breaking curses, and so much more!  This is a movie for the whole family!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  My kind of love story!<br />The history was interesting and new to me.  The characters were delightful, both the main character and all the others.  Because of the number of characters and how they were presented, I did have a little trouble remembering some of the minor characters.  I like the way the story line was slowly revealed and the end result was unfolded.<br /> And it was absolutely my kind of love story.  To explain:  I am not fond of \\"love at first sight stories\\", or the \\"war and peace love stories (they fight until they fall in love)\\" or the \\"forbidden love\\" kind.  All those formulas have not appeal to me.  But this one had three potential lovers, two with very good prospects.  Then they were both eliminated as prospects and the winner was slowly revealed.  And it all tied up nicely at the end.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is the best ever.  I loved the books.  I have read them multiple times.  I would love to have met a &#34;Christian Grey&#34; in my youth.  I fell in love with the love story and that is what these books were a &#34;GREAT LOVE STORY.&#34;  Yes there is lots of unrealistic sex but I saw past that into who the man really was.  A MUST READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This was a charming fanciful story, with lots of \\"religious philosophy\\" thrown in the mix.  If you take it with a grain of salt, and just \\"go along\\" it will be a delightful adventure.  I liked Pi a lot, and delighted with his joys, and worried every time he faced a new obstacle.  He certainly had a sweet way of adapting to every situation--evoking some part of any religion to fit his need at the moment.  If you fight this--you won't enjoy the story.  I decided to just like him and let it be.<br />There was more blood and guts than I normally want in a story.  I was a little shocked that my 11 year old grandson had read and like it.  It got pretty tiresome at times.  I noticed the movie left out the potential cannibalism.  Good choice, if they want kids to watch it.
0545265355|4.0|I loved book two the best.  I saw Hunger Games the movie before I even decided to read the books.  I am glad we do not really live in times like these.
0385491026|4.0|'Little girls are cute and small only to adults. To one another they are not cute. They are life-sized.'<br /><br />Cat's Eye immerses the reader into the murky psychological realms of memory, perception, identity and self-esteem and on how these aspects of our inner life are affected and mediated by and through our relationships with others. Specifically, it focuses on the formative relationships we make with our peers as children and the scars we may carry with us long after the cruel games of childhood are far behind us.<br /><br />Not only a gifted writer and master of plot, Atwood is an extremely astute observer of humanity and all our foibles and predelictions. There is something revelatory in her description of everyday interactions and the evocation of the small details that fill the interstitial spaces of life. The portraits of all the main characters are deeply compelling, especially in the sections covering the period of Elaine's girlhood.<br /><br />The story follows accomplished (and now middle-aged) artist Elaine Risley as she returns to Toronto, a city she abandoned many years earlier, to attend her first career retrospective. As is customary with narratives built around such reluctant homecomings, Elaine is forced to confront the ghosts of her Toronto past and the reasons she eventually fled to build a new life on the opposite coast.<br /><br />Atwood's excellent tale uses this premise to explore the relatively occluded world of female bullying and peer pressure. In part what we are given is a forensic study into the (non-physical) tools of feminine violence, as acted out among young 'innocents' of primary school age. It is an eloquent exploration of the experience of being bullied from the perspective of a nine year old victim. The novel also explores how the teenager, then the young adult and finally the mature woman copes with and processes this legacy, a period of time that lies in her psyche like a lead weight. As the reader we experience this by accompanying Elaine during various stages of her life (and the different levels of psychological and emotional development attendant on these phases).<br /><br />As a man I cannot confidently judge how well Atwood has captured the complicated friendships, hypocrisies, manipulations and power games between little girls and then teenage and adult women. But the picture she paints is persuasive and has the ring of authenticity. It certainly coheres with some of what I recall were my sister's experiences. And in terms of my own experiences of bullies and peer pressure as played out in the boys' corner of the playground, I am not completely unequiped to recognise the underlying gritty reality and universality of these portrayals. As a male reader I also feel that Atwood has given me one of the key things I look for in literature, which is an insight into an aspect of lived human experience that would otherwise be inaccessible to me.<br /><br />'The past isn't quaint while you're in it. Only at a safe distance, later, when you can see it as décor, not as the shape your life's been squeezed into.'<br /><br />The central pivot point for the whole narrative is Elaine's complicated relationship over the years with her by-turns friend, tormenter and acolyte, Cordelia; who in the end just occupies the space of a human shaped guilt-ridden memory. Cat's Eye, on one level about bullying, on another level is really about identity and the desperate, needy actions of two young girls negotiating the obstacles of growing up, wanting to belong, and trying to carve out a space for themselves in a hostile or merely indifferent world. By witnessing the dependencies and independencies that make up Elaine and Cordelia's relationship we learn that victims aren't always victims, the strong may actually be the weak and that while forgiveness may not always be forthcoming, sometimes understanding and even pity may be in the end (but probably only after it is too late). For Elaine, after all the heartache, frustration and anger has been exhausted - or maybe merely confronted and overcome - what she is left with is an empty regret and an overwhelming sense of potential robbed; of what should have become a mature friendship enriched by decades of companionship instead stolen by circumstance, selfish decisions and the vicissitudes of life. And then wonder why we held onto our pain for so long. Wonder why we let it have a disproportionate influence on our life.<br /><br />In the end, Elaine discovers that friendship is important. No matter how independent and self-reliant we may become, how resilient, we still need these little alliances, these co-conspirators. Their absence can leave a gnawing gap in an otherwise full and happy life.<br /><br />'But I began to think of time as having a shape, something you could see, like a series of liquid transparencies, one laid on top of another. You don't look back along time but down through it, like water. Sometimes this comes to the surface, sometimes that, sometimes nothing. Nothing goes away.'<br /><br />What makes Atwood an excellent novelist is she is very easy to read while also very engaging in terms of story. She is adept at creating expectation and interest. With Cat's Eye I found it was no chore to consume a lot of pages in a single sitting. Atwood also has an excellent facility for plot and pacing. As a novelist she has a great sense for maintaining proportion between various story elements when developing the plot; something too many other authors get impatient with and therefore rush to the story's detriment.<br /><br />In short, Atwood displays in this engaging book all of the skill and technique of an accomplished novelist and master of her craft who is not a dry practitioner but has a passion and need for storytelling.

The performances are great and makes up for any sound  quality issues. I'll bet it sounds great on a premium sound system. Page, Plant and Jones show they still have what it takes for a bunch of old geezers and Jason Bonham put's in a performance of a lifetime. A great achievement from one of the best bands in rock and roll.

B008OOYALE|3.0|The kindle fire version needs to have the same features as the version for the ipad and ipod. When that happens I will give this game five stars.
B00006LLNU|5.0|That's what this and their first album did to me. This album in particularly has this heavenly ambiance yet contrasting with its other half where the mood becomes deeply melancholy. As far as their discography goes, this might be their opus. As this is their most interpretative/open ended albums to date, but all the other albums have the same consistent beauty though. Absolutely priceless music, and changed my life thanks to its resonance + personal motivation during my struggles in art class back in late highschool. Now I'm an official art major and have stayed inspired ever since. Thank you, Sigur Rós.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|First, if you want to use this knife to strike a ferro rod, you will have to remove some of the coating on the spine of the blade. The coating is nice and slick but won't touch a spark off of any rod. I just used some medium sand paper and it works great. The blade is great for big cutting jobs and I was able to make a feather stick with it. I did baton some large pieces of wood and it went right through it. Edge could have been a bit sharper but not bad out of the box.<br />The sheath is sturdy but because the knife is so heavy it tends to flop over when you don't have the snap around the handle. It won't fall out of the sheath because the kydex hold the blade very well. There are about 6 eyelets on the sheath. I then used a short piece of para cord to secure the sheath to my leg and it solved that issue.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|Hope the second and third movies are as good and that they are not too far away from being released.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The cast is fantastic and must have had a great time working together. The newcomers, the young leads, were just perfect and deserved an oscar nod along side the &#34;Beasts of the Sothern Wild&#34; girl. This film will make you laugh, and you never know which way it is going. I highly recommend it ............. don't let this slip away. It will capture your heart and when it is over - you will say &#34; Gee, that was a great small movie with a big heart &#34; - kind of magical and definitely worth seeing - even if just for Edwatd Norton's boy scout uniform. Order this - see it - cherish it and don't say I didn't tell you.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I think one of the most thankless tasks that can be laid upon an actor is that of portraying a historical personality that is already a national icon. The audience comes to the theater with a firmly held opinion in place and the film is judged by how closely it conforms to that opinion. Daniel Day-Lewis is therefore faced with the problem of not offending the  \\"Lincoln-Is-Holier-Than-God\\" crowd while at the same time retaining some degree of artistic integrity. I think he walks that fine line as well as anyone could, but the nature of the task he has undertaken imposes its own limits on what he can do with the role. Kudos to him for his considerable effort.<br /><br />Sally Fields as the unstable Mary Todd Lincoln is, IMHO, shallow, entirely predictable, and as cardboard as a shipping box.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist senator Thaddeus Stevens delivers his usual strong performance and is clearly the most memorable supporting character in the cast.<br /><br />The opening, depicting the fighting at Petersburg, Virginia, is extraordinary. It's a shame that it is so short, and that he rest of the script does not live up to the potential that the opening scene seems to promise.

B004FP1WX0|4.0|Like many critics of this film, I find it a little hard to believe.  Not so much that it all seems rather convenient that the film crew starts filming this long-distance romance so early on.  What is also hard to swallow is how no one in the film does a basic google search until Nev is fairly deep into his attachment.  But what really makes this hard to believe is that a man born and breed in New York City falls head over heels without even meeting a woman.  I have lived here for 12 years and trust me, most men in New York are not so quick to jump like this.  In fact, the vast majority are the exact opposite.<br /><br />All that said the film is still engrossing and an interesting watch, but you kind of have to ask yourself &#34;Who would be that stupid?&#34;
B000G7599Y|4.0|This 10 CD box set of Mozart's symphonies includes performances originally issued at the end of the 1960's following intensive recording sessions in Berlin in March and November 1968, to record all of the earlier symphonies so that they could supplement the earlier recordings made by B&ouml;hm and the Berlin Philharmonic, in 1959 through 1966. All performances are by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Karl B&ouml;hm.<br /><br />In 1996 Deutsche Grammophon re-issued these performances in a 10 CD collection ([[ASIN:B000009M4L Mozart: 46 Symphonies - Berlin Philharmonic / Karl B&ouml;hm]]), and then in 2006 they re-issued them again (the box set displayed here). Both box sets are identical other than the packaging, and since prices vary on Amazon particularly from the third-party \\"marketplace\\" vendors, if you are interested in this box set then I would suggest checking both entries on Amazon in order to find the best deal.<br /><br />These are fine performances, and in fact [[ASIN:B002NPCW5G The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music 2008]] includes this box set as a recommendation for the full set of symphonies, along with the more recent collections [[ASIN:B0000BWTKM Mozart: 51 Symphonies ~ Tate]] and [[ASIN:B000069KJ3 Complete Mozart Symphonies, Pinnock]]. As well, [[ASIN:0860249247 The Gramophone Classical Music Guide 2012]] recommends the Pinnock box set if you want to obtain the entire collection of symphonies in one place and with a single conductor and orchestra. Keep in mind that Pinnock uses \\"original\\" instruments and those performances will not have the warmth of B&ouml;hm's recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic. The Tate box is relatively expensive at the present time, but the Pinnock box is quite reasonable.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, this collection of 46 symphonies maybe not \\"complete\\" given more recent collections, but nevertheless probably as complete as most Mozart listeners would desire.<br /><br />This is a very satisfactory choice for a \\"mostly\\" complete collection of Mozart's symphonies, with warm and traditional performances and at a very reasonable price.ry satisfactory choice for a \\"mostly\\" complete collection of Mozart's symphonies, with warm and traditional performances and at a very reasonable price.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|it was somewhat difficult to visualize the events and characters.  Knowing the background and history of the Irish people helps a lot in understanding the frustrations and mistreatment of the poor folks.  Seeing the movie helped a little too.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Creative blend of western and sci-fi standards to create ensemble examination of classic themes and issues.  At least that's what I tell my students when I use episodes in class.  That the series is downright fun is the real reason it works.

B005LVR6ZA|4.0|Philip Dick has a tendency to throw a whole lot of disparate elements into a novel, with the result that you're never quite sure where the book is going on what it's even really about. This time around, we get psychics of several varieties, time travel of sorts, talking appliances (including a particularly troublesome door), a trip to the moon, inter-corporation rivalry and contact with people from beyond the grave. Following a character through one of these novels is a little like watching an ant walking across a dead leaf that's being tossed about by the wind. You know the whole time that the character's efforts to puzzle out his predicament are going to come to nothing, but you can't stop watching. And there's so much weirdness going on that when a character comes to what should be a stunning realization about his situation, he sort of shrugs and just keeps going, like the ant walking off the edge of the leaf. You remember how freaked out you when you watched The Matrix for the first time and you found out that Neo's whole life was just a computer program? Imagine a moment like that, except that Neo doesn't really notice that anything has changed. He just kind of goes, &#34;Oh, that makes sense. I've been in a computer program this whole time. And I guess I'm not anymore.&#34; That's what reading Philip Dick's better books is like. The paranoia is made all the more compelling by the offhand way it's shown to be completely rational. Of course the world is crazy, Dick seems to be saying. You'd be insane to think otherwise.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie was a very pleasant surprise, that far exceeded my expectations! The characters are fabulous, the storyline very engaging, and went from very funny to incredibly inspiring in a moment. I loved it!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|GREAT books. Currently I am on Feast of Crows. I have surpassed where the TV series is and I seriously have a hard time putting this down. On stormy days I like to fire up the kindle, grab a beer and sit on the porch and read these amazing books. I also thought maybe it would be boring to me reading the first book or two knowing the general ideas from the TV series but it was not at all. There some differences, first of all, but also it's just well written and engrossing no matter what. The characters are very fleshed out, the descriptions great, and dare I say the books are quite more disturbing/racier than the show so as to not make it tedious if you have watched the series to the current epsiode (season 3 ep 4 at this time). HIGHLY recommend.
B000J670ZI|3.0|This movie was too silly without being funny. The main characters were acting too moronic to be believable. 3 stars was generous.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Not going to lie, Season 1, especially the last few episodes, are hard to top. I am happy to say Season 2 holds up amazingly! It is a bit more fragmented SPOILER? because groups/characters once all around each other sort of split up END SPOILER so it may seem less cohesive to some but it is done aptly and never becomes confusing. Again,m as with my Season 1 review, I am reading the books (currently almost done with Book 4 (feast of crows) and I am both happy and not at all confused with any changes made for the series. I could see this series going to 7 seasons, so here's hoping they all stay on course!<br /><br />By the way, Season 3 so far is splendid as well...

B005LAIIHG|2.0|This long movie had some beautifully shot scenes, seemed promising from all the previews and reviews, but in the end the story was rather lacking in holding my attention.  My young son even like seeing some shots about the tiger and whales, however overall the it seemed as though it was more about beautiful filming (or CGI effects) than anything else.  Maybe that was the point and I missed it, but considering the fact that there was a book it was based upon, I have a feeling that I'm not wrong.

B00881PTRC|3.0|not very interesting as it gets boring quickly. No real challenge or potential for interaction like if playing traditional hangman with another person
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|Finally, every track from the Aloha shows are together on one collection. The original album sounds clear, and the Alternate Aloha sounds great in the remixed form. The packaging is phenominal. I enjoy how they have replicated the original album from the record labels to the various artwork. Even the silly inner sleeve picture of Elvis super imposed with the hula girls was included. Overall, this is a great review of an historic event in music history.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies because I'm a boomer, and I can relate to it. I've seen it 5 times.
B007REV4YI|5.0|An excellent movie and disc.  I found it no better or worse a movie than the first two.  Just a continuation of the story.  Really didn't like the bad guy character.  They could have done much better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would highly recommend this set of books to anyone looking for HOT, STEAMY, book with a little bit of MYSTERY and SUSPENSE !!!<br />I love all three books !!!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I had seen the movie in the theater.  The movie is excellent for new bond fans and the disc was very good with no problems.
B0064QNS62|5.0|love the game, but have trouble getting pass level 13, I can't believe I made it to level 13, its a great game
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I had to see the continuation of the story from Casino Royale.  It's as good as I expected.  Now on to Sky Fall.
B00094ASR2|5.0|But i'll try. Gorillaz are incredible. their sound has an eerie fanfare to it that is delightfully contagious. demon days is one of their greatest accomplishments in my opinion, i've been listening to it for ages and recently started collecting vinyl. Considering paying around $300+ for one just to frame and display in the apartment. i can always come back to demon days and just have a musical experience rather than a nice break listening to 'a song'. this album concept is gorgeous. get it. listen to it. steal it. do what you gotta do get down to some gorillaz in a happy mood.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I absolutely love Rihanna. She is so FEMME and her songs bring out the good in you which can sometimes lie dormant.
B00BF11STU|2.0|It is really hard to rate this movie considering the secrecy and official propaganda regarding these events. The water boardings, beatings, acceptance of torture of the Bush Administration, and Obama's need to prove himself by killing Bin Laden, show a very dark side of our nation. My greatest disappointment was with the Seals. They train endlessly to avoid killing those they are not targeting. Yet,... well, just watch the movie. It is sad.<br /><br />If this was an accurate movie about historical events, the focus would not have been on the mentally unbalanced woman working for the CIA. She would have had a role to play, but just that, a role. The Hollywood formula, &#34;drama equals box office receipts,&#34;  kicks in and it's over as far as historical accuracy and perspective is concerned.<br /><br /> This is not an entertainment movie. Even though I didn't like it, I believe the movie should be seen by people who vote. Maybe it will trigger some thinking about the need for intelligent and wise leaders.

B00APUQRPC|3.0|this one was a little too preditable, nothing impressive it's like all Clint Eastwood films, where he is the hero.
0061148512|5.0|first of all, this book is bound beautifully. Sylvia Plath's story is gorgeous, but what makes this book unique is the forward by Frances McCullough, who was working at the publishing house that eventually published this book in the US. and the account she gives of the hardships endured by Plath during this time is worth the read.
B0018AJNH2|3.0|The Cube series is an interesting concept but one of the most important features was the absence of explanation. This film makes the error of giving some insight into why and how things function...don't try to answer why. The best writers of horror know that why is irrelevant and counterproductive as long as the what is sufficiently intriguing.

I would like to see a couple of changes:  * I'd like to have a carousel for each collection  * The ability to quickly change between the various carousels  * From the carousel, the ability to remove a book from a collection in addition to the already present capability of adding a book to a collection.

B00BMUYLSE|4.0|On their 2012 collection of collaborations, The Flaming Lips asked `Is David Bowie Dying?'  On the opening track of `The Next Day' Bowie responds: `Not quite.'  Still, the album is permeated by death, doubt, uncertainty, negation and scorn.  But it's far more than mere `morning after' regret.  In Bowie's career benchmark, `Heroes' the main lyric is `we can be heroes just for one day.'  Here, Bowie adopts the anti-hero role.  He looks back on a whole life, not quite in anger, but a sense of questioning.<br /><br />While Heroes is artsy and experimental, The Next Day is stolid and rooted in the past.  Heroes functions as a tour-de-force of punk meets prog sensibility, pop artistry, and a core of exploration, pushing boundaries. The Next Day comes across as an exhibition of Bowie's underexplored influences. From the 50's rock touches of `Valentine's Day' and `How Does the Grass Grow' to the hard rock of `(You Will) Set The World On Fire' the album acts as an aural museum exhibiting bits and pieces of Bowie's oeuvre.<br /><br />Standout tracks include `The Stars (Are Out Tonight)' and the title opener.  These are as good as anything Bowie has released.  Also, `Dancing Out In Space' fuses strange harmonies around a Country & Western framework.  It's vintage Bowie - combining elements, borrowing two or three different ideas nearly inventing a separate genre.  This is Bowie's modus operandi - brilliance and moments of WTF?.  Such as the U2-esque opening of the prog rock adventure `If You Can See Me'.<br /><br />Usually, it works somehow. The one questionable track is `I'd Rather Be High', which would have been fine as a bonus track.  But, it's anti-war, pro-drug neo-psychedelic vibe and Eastern-influenced guitar figure don't show much of the creativity we expect from Bowie.<br /><br />The Star Man, The Thin White Duke. The lyric \\"I tell myself, I don't know who I am,\\" from the closing track `Heat' fits nicely in retrospect.  Still, the line `my father ran the prison' reveals some deeper story.  This is Bowie's strongest weakness: oblique narration.  Emotional delivery of a veiled story making little connection outside an intellectual knowledge of the context somehow revealed later.  It's intriguing for those who like a puzzle, but has always left him somewhat out of the mainstream.  It's like transmissions from a civilization on a parallel existence.<br /><br />Mr. Jones has carefully chosen `Heroes' as the foil against which the `The Next Day', his first album in 10 years, functions.  While `Heroes' established Bowie as a sultan of art-rock, along with collaborator Brian Eno, The Next Day, sans Eno, sounds more like the sum of Bowie's musical career.  If you're a fan of Bowie or just a fan of music, this is a good album to have in your collection.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This was the best one out of all the rest of the Men in Black , very funny. And plenty of action outstanding special effects very important for a film like this .
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I had my app updated yesterday and it is quite frustrating.  I switch between bibles for comparison as I study.  App freezes up in the switching.

Very dissatisfied with this update.

0307352153|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who wants more understanding/insight into their own personality if they are introverted, and a general commentary on societies as a whole.  As an introvert, it helped give validation for the need for much more alone time than most people I know.  As the book points out, society can easily label someone who spends a lot of time alone as a \\"loner\\" or \\"anti-social\\" or some other derogatory term.  It is also give great insight into how introverts can best adapt to their environments, or as the author puts it, \\"fake it till you make it\\" in situations that require introverts to be temporarily extroverted.<br />Overall, very helpful read.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|Thanks to Peg for recommending Ken Follett. I've been at a dry spell for a new author to indulge myself in and I guess it's going to be Ken Follett. A little more of a love story than I usually would like but well written and very interesting book. I look forward to reading more of his books.  After book 2 of the Century Trilogy what would anyone recommend next?

B00632HWOG|4.0|I like this app because you can always add emotions and videos and pictures but I have no idea how to get videos from YouTube and then send them threw an e-mail
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|The clip-on design makes it really easy to put the red filter on and off even in the water, which is convenient if you are taking continuous video/pictures before and after you dive. The filter comes with a string so that you can tether it to the GoPro. The filter appears to be well made and clips on the GoPro lens frame perfectly. The filter works as expected. I compared the shots I took with and without the filter, and the filter definitely brings back lost colors.<br /><br />The downside with the design is that when droplets of water get into the inside part of the filter, it tends to stay there and can ruin your shots. It happens when you attach the filter to the GoPro while underwater. Although you can get rid of the droplets on the outside part of the filter, the inside part that is between the GoPro lens and filter is sealed and the droplets tend to stick. I didn't notice the problem until I uploaded the photos/videos on my computer. I believe that this can be mediated by simply checking for any droplets of water on the camera filter before recording, or by keeping the inside of the filter dry and attaching it to the GoPro before going down the water (this also implies keeping it attached while underwater).<br /><br />Aside from that, I feel that the price is also little too expensive.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a great product and I plan to use it in subsequent dives.
B00B19DW0E|4.0|I was a kid when this movie first came and since then I've never had a chance to re-watch it. Really glad to see that still is relevant up to this day. Very imaginative, great action scenes. A must watch.
B008JFUO9K|3.0|Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III.  The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is 'can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers?'  The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time.  It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time.  So, how do you follow that kind of success?  The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success - at least any other comic book film, that is.  We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it?  The answer to that question is: momentum.  Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine.  Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film - well, we have that answer for you.<br /><br />Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks.  Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States.  One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire - which quickly gains Stark's attention.  At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an \\"explosive\\" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis.  Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr.  Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm.  Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress.  The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions.  Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley - who is nothing short of a treat in this film.  They honestly couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character).  Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark - just because he's smarter than everyone else.  Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting villain in the franchise.<br /><br />Now - here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight.  If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption.  The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers.  If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Pine, or Chris Hemsworth - you'll be very disappointed.  Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.  And, the ugly has to begin with an apology.  Sorry, kids - there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy (unless Shane Black decides to add another scene after the fact, like Joss Whedon in The Avengers).  This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.<br /><br />Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be.  Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of The Empire Strikes Back.  He gets an ass-kicking in this film that just keeps on giving.  However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films.  For the average movie-goer, Iron Man III is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy.  Iron Man II has the best villains, Iron Man has the best plot, and Iron Man III is just a combination of the first two films.  Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning - in the grand scheme of things - Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.  There's not much of cliffhanger and nothing overly exciting going on to lead into the next Phase II film.  Sure, it's an enjoyable, entertaining fill - but this critic can't help but want more.<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers.  Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) - yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C+<br />FNDNreview.comst one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|One of the best lively, funny and emotional cartoons I have ever watched, loved it.  I watched it 3 times in a span of 4 days.
1616550414|5.0|I have been a Zelda fan for a long time, and this made my day when the book came in. So much of the information makes sense when you read it all. I will not spoil it out there for it is recommended to just buy it. And the price is just right for this book too! I 100% suggest you get this if you love the lore of the Zelda series.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book is - in my opinion - second only to Dracula when it comes to a great vampire tale. If you're a fan of horror, vampires, or even zombies, this book is a must-read. It delivers in every possible way. And please, if you've seen the movie, please don't think that is representative of the book. It's truly not.<br /><br />This is also the book that (love 'em or hate 'em) gave us the modern interpretation of zombies. It was this book that inspired Romero to write Night of the Living Dead, which changed the face of the zombie forever.<br /><br />Read this book. At the very least, it's the second best vampire tale ever written... and there's merit to the assertion that it's the best.
B00ABMZRVO|4.0|Not a great plot, but an interesting, well-acted movie.  It makes you think about the limits of relationships and whether or not one person can actually &#34;save&#34;another.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Loved the integration of the last three companions in this season. I wanted Donna to die when we first met her in the Christmas special, but she really does grow on you. Grandpa Wilf is AMAZING!  Probably my 3rd favorite character in the series so far. (Behind Tennant's Doctor and Rose.)  I love the Planet of the Ood, but think A New Doctor was one of the weakest episodes so far. Ibam dragging my feet going through the specials because I do not want 10's time to end. I'm sure Matt Smith is wonderful, but when Tennant really is the ultimate Doctor.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|An all around great movie.  I watched In Cold Blood and then this movie for an entertaining, thought-provoking movie weekend.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|After years of patiently waiting, the wheel of time came to a grinding halt. I am thankful for this series mainly because it is how I discovered Brandon Sanderson. When he took over for Jordan I decided to read his other books before I went back to the wheel of time and found my favorite author. Sorry to say but Sanderson was what this series needed.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The acting in this film and the script itself are both off the charts- brilliant. The depiction of mental illness in its subtle and overt forms is so accurate it will make the viewer uncomfortable. At times, the viewer will feel as edgy as the characters.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I needed Adobe flash player. this didn't work for what I needed. I needed the flash player on my Kindle for ABC Mouse to work.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|We saw this in the theater. The story starts out intriguing enough, with two little girls having been raised in the woods by a mysterious entity they call Mama. But then the film goes down familiar roads. There are a couple of jump scares but not nearly enough, and the big finale is almost laughable - with all the money at their disposal, they couldn't have made Mama more interesting looking? Sometimes she devolves into a pile o' hair that scoots across the floor like a crazy Roomba, and that elicited some chuckles. The ending was definitely the weakest part of the whole movie. Worth a rental.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I needed adobe flash play on my Kindle for ABC Mouse to work for my daughter. Now she can't play it on the Kindle.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great puzzle solver game. The puzzles are not too easy, but not too hard. I never needed a hint, but had to struggle a bit here and there. Game play is pretty much one dimensional. That is, you are forced to follow a specific sequence of moves to solve each stage. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to sequels!
B006K1IIHA|3.0|Discs didn't play in my blu-ray player. But I did see that there was a chance it wouldn't before I bought it because of some technical reason. But they were cheap and was delivered quickly and in perfect condition.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney have turned out another, great Jack Ryan,Jr. Thriller with an action packed, fast paced super scientific, and accurate military and intelligence story,
B008J05EL8|1.0|I ordered this app on April 5,2013. Could never open it, a week later I deleted it. I paid $4.99;asked for a refund, took no time to get my refund. This app had more 1 stars than 2,3,4 or 5. I usually read the reviews, but this time I didn't. Wish I had. THEY need to take this app off the market or go back to the drawing board and fix it. Don't waste your money or time.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie looked so promising.  It just simply fell flat.  What should have been a very funny comedy was instead horribly depressing in some sections.  The funny parts of the movie were funny, but they were far to few and far between.  I don't recommend this movie.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play very enjoyable, great way to pass the time on rainy night or any boring day. Highly recommend this game, especially if u have a kindle fire.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The thoughts from Ms Reichs at the end do best describe this book. It's like soup. There is so much information from here and there. Tidbits and morsels that if placed in a text book would be bland. However here are the parts of the story recipe needed to put it all together. I learned a lot of things I never would have otherwise and enjoyed the way it all went down
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|I've watched only the first part, but the DVD hiccups every few minutes, and sometimes it stops completely.  I have not had the opportunity to watch the other DVDs in the set, but I am very disappointed and am not sure how to handle this problem (my first problem with an Amazon purchase).  Regarding the story: it's interesting, and I'm excited to watch more when time permits.  I just hope the technical problem does not persist.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|I bought the CD for my Mother-in-Law, who loves Michael Bolton.  Amazon's wonderful cloud player then recognized my purchase and the digital version appeared there.  I found myself listening to this album and have really enjoyed it.  These are the songs I grew up hearing!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic movements.  Easy to earn gems without having to buy them .  Kid friendly.  Horse competitions realistic.  Easy to earn money.
B001P06GX4|4.0|The rules are simple and was a breeze to teach my five year old. Since we have gotten it, we have been playing it really often as a family. We were very disappointed however, at the state the box arrived in. It was all battered as it was only wrapped in brown paper and the box isn't very durable.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is fun finding the hidden objects but it seems to me that they really want  you to spend money and I really do not have it at this time. But overall it is fun
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Lacked character and story development.  Just another Hollywood thriller.  I would have liked to learn more bout the area and people of Thailand and what they went through, not just this wealthy family, the &#34; beautiful people&#34;.  Thes scenes of the mother and son riding the rapid current together and staying together was not believable.<br /><br />Waste of Time film
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome but I wish they put the ender men and ender dragon on here because I'm obsessed with dragons. But it's still awesome either way.
0345803485|5.0|The book is classified as erotic fiction where I am sure the word `erotic' is used in the loosest sense of the word. If erotic passages are meant to induce an almost impossible combination of disbelief, cringing and inadvertent hilarity then, by all means, Fifty Shades of Grey is the most erotic novel ever written.until now, I did not think it was possible to wince, laugh, and grind my teeth at same time
B0044C5SCU|3.0|Fringe season 3, all be it, better than season 2, still does not out do the first season! A little too way out there even for the type of show it is!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel is very well wrItten and entertaining.  It grabbed me from the start and I couldn't put it down.  But without spoiling....I'll just say the conclusion to the mystery was a thumbs down for me.  The more I think about it....it actually makes me mad!  But maybe that is good writing at work.  It did move me!  But that ending, for me anyway,  ruined the book.
0743289692|5.0|A grand expose of a life story by one who lived under the domination of Islam.  It should be read by all of our elected officials who say Islam is a peaceful religion  and promote its laws and way of life  while turning a deaf ear to how women are treated under this system.  Where are the women who call for women's rights and are silent on the plight of women living under these laws?
B009GED3HS|5.0|Love this show! Watched every episode up to season 7 on Netflix so I had to have 8. I'd always till after this would come on and not able to record so Amazon was great and cheap. They even refunded me a $1.99 because I had it set to auto-buy and it was a day late in delivering it to me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Amazing story I am an RN and I have had an interest in life after death stories for a while I have read many and also heard my fellow nurses tell stories from their patients I have been undecided if I believe these stories are really life after death Proof of heaven is so believable due to the scientific explanations by the author I could not put this book down<br />I read the entire book in one sitting
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I remember hearing about the Phantom of the Opera at the theatre years ago and heard some of the music on the radio, but I guess life was in my way and never gave it much thought.  Someone had a copy of this DVD and I watched it and fell in love with it.  The songs stayed in my head for days, and enjoyed the acting and well, everything about it.  I understand that POTO is going to come to theatres in the US again starting in the Fall of 2013 and even though the movie is wonderful, am going to see it on stage also.  Not going to miss out on it this time.  I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys muscials and love stories.
0670026557|4.0|My headline says business person but truly this is a book for every human. A very insightful read, with positive uplifting thoughts on how to give back and not feel taken advantage of; great wisdom and highly recommended.
0767903862|5.0|Laugh out loud funny! Love traveling with Mr. Bryson because it is always done with a smile and many insights into the place you may find yourself at that given moment.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My daughter and I are addicts of this series.  It is so refreshing to have a show that is appropriate for the whole family, and yet delightfully stimulating for adults as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game even if you pay for some thing then it gives it to u and if it doesn't work then when u call them then they give Romney back and still gives it to u
B003QSPTAY|5.0|This is my families favorite version of this movie.  Don't know why they ever remade it.  Stick to the originals.  Wish the studios would only remake movies that were done horribly the first time, then there is only room for improvement.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I would whatever it for u if u bought it for 1.00 Bc it is a rip off from angery birds.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun, love to play all day never gets dull, can be expensive if you buy the money packs. I recommend
B008602KQI|5.0|I am so glad this movie is part of the Prime line up! I had heard good things about the movie, but the trailers left me, well &#34;trailing&#34; for other movies which were out at the time. However, after watching it on the Kindle in its entirety,  it has left me anxiously waiting for the sequel!  Is there one??!!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Always enjoy films from Peter Jackson & this is no exception we all eagerly await the arrival of the next film.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie was cute, great for kids and teaches a lesson. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone that has kids, they will love it!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Wew always like to watch the new cartoons with our nieces, and this one had there attention all the way thru.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Wicked funny! Good family movie. The elfs are super funny! Great story line. Who would have thunk elfs not building toys!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis does an excellent job in this portrayal of Lincoln. If you like history at all you should watch this film.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I am very satisfied with this light. I've never had a light  so bright with so little battery drain. I'll buy another
B00CDT41RY|5.0|In typical Tarantino style, there is lots of action & lots of blood. Tarantino just can't make a bad film.
B00BHMF578|4.0|John Goodman was great. Alal Arkin excellent as old school Hollywood mogul.<br />Very good ensemble piece with all performances very strong.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a good family movie especially for those that have kids over the age of ten. There were a couple spots that were scary for anyone younger.
B00181MHQU|5.0|IF YOU LIKE MUSICALS AND YOU LIKE ROMANCE YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.  I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED IT AND WANTED MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER TO SEE IT.  I TOLD HER IT WAS COMPARABLE TO ROMEO AND JULIET WHICH SHE ENJOYED.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Interesting story. It has a great cast of actors who perform well. You won't be disappointed. This is not for chldren
B002XZOZQA|5.0|MY DAUGHTER WAS IN HER FIRST DANCE COMPETITION LAST WEEK.  TEENAGERS ARE TRYING TO FIND THEMSELVES AND COMPARE THEMSELVES TO THEIR PEERS.  IT WAS FUN TO SHARE THIS MOVIE WITH HER.  I SAW IT ON BROADWAY YEARS AGO AND WANTED HER TO SEE IT SHE ENJOYED IT.  RECOMMENDED  FOR THOSE WHO LOVE MUSICALS, AND TEENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE ARTS.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I'd never heard of this movie. I got bored in the first 15 minutes.... I fell asleep. I figure if a movie doesn't grab you and pull you in, it's not worth watching. Just my opinion
1476734941|5.0|Easy to follow, and it is working! This is a painless way to loose the winter weight. Fast days are well described and the book has nice pictures of the meals for thelow calorie days.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had seen this movie in the theatre and was so impressed I wanted my own copy. Fabulous, heart-rending story.<br />DVD arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition<br />Bravo!
B00425S1H8|1.0|I found this cable and was attracted by the price.  When I tried to use it to connect between my PC and another device, it did not work.  I later bought a cable at Radio Shack that worked fine in the same applicaiton.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing, fast paced, and addictive! This should definitely come with a series, an honest two thumbs up!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I really enjoyed the read and I couldn't put it down. The book pulls you into the situation and emotion that he goes through.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is really good I recommend it. Even though if you run out of money it is a pain to get more.
0670020745|4.0|She was able to put into words the experience of having a stroke and recovering from it. I learned so much. Conventional wisdom always said that if you had not regained functionality within a year, there was no chance to get it back. She proved them wrong. It took her some eight years to fully recover from her massive stroke. This is also a tale of love and family and a mother giving all she could to save her daughter.
B00AIJP9BS|4.0|This game is unique and very challenging.  Keep up the good work.  I had a little trouble in the beginning but &#34;practice makes perfect.&#34;
0425252868|5.0|It was very good to read about the great event from both sides.  If one has an interest in WWII it is a must read.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|Not enough instructions, can't figure out what to do and who is who.  Would like a tutorial to help with game.
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|Since I have read all the Reacher books, thought I would see the movie, Loosely based on the book One Shot, Reacher is never called \\"Jack\\" just Reacher, He would never be in a high speed chase driving a mustang, If you haven't read any of the Reacher books, you might think the movie wasn't bad, But Tom Cruise playing Reacher just isn't believable .
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Takes a while to get use to but once you do you cannot stay off of it the creators put a lot of thought into making this game and it is free all around fun and addicting
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Has all the elements I enjoy with only 1 type of puzzle (the one where you have to coordinate the piece movements) that I never seem able to do in a reasonable amount of time. I love the variety of minipuzzles and when hidden objects are hidden. The map was very clear to follow and the action alerts were really helpful.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The books that Rick Riordan writes have completely changed my mind on what  a good book is! Never have I read a book that is more interesting, entertaining, and suspenseful in my life. This book exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to see what happens next and what adventures await for the 7 demigods. I recommend this book for everybody! Adults, elderly, teenagers, and everybody else because if you don't you are really missing out  on an AMAZING book!!!! :D
B00942G4UA|4.0|Will turn you into a vegetarian, whether you like it or not. A very eye opening look at the meat we eat
B00A11AN6O|3.0|it doesn't work the way I want. it doesn't upload all my photos and makes four copies that are unwanted.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|Surprisingly, as an adult, I loved this series.  I do like sci-fi, among other genres so it was not a stretch but I thought it was more of a teen movie.  For an adult it gave a unique depiction of the fictional vampire, that I enjoyed.
1401917186|5.0|I love the information in this book. Very enlightening. I appreciate the ease and flow of how to recognize earth angels.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Can't go wrong with Stargate.  Great show. Good entertainment.  Always will be a show to go back to...just &#34;for old times sake&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story, after all the sex. I would suggest this book to all my friends. I loved it very much.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I bought this movie to entertain young adults.  I think the colorful animation is a visual masterpiece.  The characters are engaging and memorable, as is the plot of the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love that I can get all of the episodes right away.  There's such a congestion of shows on Sunday nights, I don't have to get an expensive DVR and try and record them all...I just get them right away from Amazon.  Of course, I am totally involved in all the characters, and I can't wait until the show returns in the fall.  Do I need a life?  Well, this series is just great and totally unpredictable!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|A relaxing read.....good book to read before you turn out the lights for the night. It's entertaining, & Mrs. Winters keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the &#34;next shoe to drop&#34;!! It's not a fast paced read but enjoyable & intriguing 'til the end!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Although it's a bit too gruesome at times, I find this series awesome in it's writing.  I get drawn in each episode!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The  novel  flows in a in a straight timeline towards a surprise ending when it is peeled back like an onion<br />This encourages the reader to reread the book which now will be different novel
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|At first, I didn't think the series would keep my attention, but I kept watching each week, and it just gets better and better! With all the competing shows on Sunday evenings, I find that getting the episode for $1.89 and watching at my leisure on any device is fabulous!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Id love to see this series carried on through to present day. It is quite the history lesson aside from the entertainment, I was so afraid that the introduction of Shirley MacLaine to the mix was going to ruin the show, I could not have been more wrong, she had us in hysterics most of the time she was on screen. It is worth actually owning the DVDs which is a practice I'm starting to shy away from with all the streaming availability. I don't like the idea of someone else controlling content once something has been released. Ive seen a product adulterated too many times with music over the years.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Can't wait to see what happens next!  I love the characters and the plot twists!  It's a keeper for me!
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|a great show, see my review of gods of the arena. john Hannah worth the price of admission but the entire cast is excellent.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Jamie Foxx is electric as Django.  He is what I wanted him to be, tough, human, revengeful but good.  This movie is powerful and disturbing like all good art should be.  Quentin Tarantino is a master of pushing boundaries.  Violence in this movie is extreme, the dialogue is ridiculous and intriguing yet I loved it.
B005MMYEF8|5.0|I don't have starz and I resisted this for a while, thinking it couldn't touch ROME or GAME OF THRONES. I was wrong. this is a high quality, action packed and drama filled show with great acting. I saw BLOOD AND SAND first, then this. my thumbs way up is for both. I have started REVENGE, 5 episodes into it it is very good. I miss john Hannah tho.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|can't wait to see each episode...excellent writing...interesting characters...brilliant casting...you never know what's going to happen next!  we're enjoying the series because we didn't get to watch it when it first came out on tv..
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|not bad, a good rental for a night of good guys v bad guys. but a bit predictable. plot seems far fetched, but could it really be based on real events? I kind off doubt it. but if you suspend belief, an ok flick.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was so interesting.  I never knew that there were so many meanings for flowers.  This was a  love story but not your typical love story.  Very well written.  One of the best books our book club has read for quite a while.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have read in a while. I just couldn't put it down.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I'd have rated it 5 stars except that the lighting was so dark in so much of the movie that I couldn't see it very well.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Have read a couple of the Jack Reacher series before but not this one.  Puts the others into perspective and plan to reach the rest of the series.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|The book is not about the crime but about its effects. It is about relationships, marriage, parenting, expectations and the devastating need to be loved.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Our  family loves watching Star Trek The Next Generation together.  Most of the time it is moral and fascinating and very memorable.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love the main legal plot in each episode and the depth of the various subplots that persist across the season/series
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is an eye opener to how the different classes operated.  It also gave me a perspective of the bible that I never realized.  When a person was invited to sit at an important person's table it was a real honor.  When Christ mingled with the tax collectors, it was a real &#34;class breaker&#34;.  I watched the first two seasons on cable and the last season on amazon.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I've enjoyed this whole series and this book was no exception.  I'm in love with all the characters and just can't wait to read about them.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I didn't know about this...my son uses it &recommends it so he set Mr up with it.  It's nice to have the whole page instead of just a little bit like other apps...so if this is what you like this is the app to go with.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Its fun but wish it would give you more lives for longer playing time.  I would recommend it for all ages.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|My son and I have really enjoyed this show. A must see for scifi fans that enjoy real life drama.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting book. It's different and thought provoking. Some areas a bit too far for me to believe, but it is science fiction after all.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The acting in this series is great so far and I really love watching dramas play out in the courtroom.  The show has an interesting premise.  The main character goes back to full-time work as a lawyer to support her family after her husband is put in prison for crimes that he may or may not have committed.  The forces at play in her husband's imprisonment are slowly revealed throughout the season.  Her personal/family drama provides a backdrop for her work as an attorney.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I am 11 and it said I was 42. what the crap I don't even look 42 or even act like it. take my advice and don't get it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am an HO/Adventure game addict and have played almost every game available for Kindle from G5, Big Fish, and others.  This was the best one EVER!  Great storyline with lots of twists and turns.  Never predictable.  Challenging but fun, rather than frustrating, mini-puzzles.  Just the right amount of hidden object hunts. Great graphics with many different locations and a big adventure component that is challenging enough to keep you from putting it down but not so difficult that you need a walkthrough or constant hints.  To be honest, since Big Fish started putting out quality games for $1.99, I have hesitated in spending $4.99 for G5 games.  But let me tell you,this one was absolutely worth the price.  If all G5 future games are of this high of quality, I will not hesitate to buy them.  I can not wait for the next one like this.  Pat yourselves on the back, G5, and if you are a fan of this type of game and are debating whether to spend the $5...  all I can say is go for it... you won't be disappointed with this one. Sequel please!?
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I need a lot more time and experience to learn how to enjoy this game and teach my 4 year old Great grandson how to do it.  Maybe if I ask him to show me?  We'll see.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I did not see the movie but saw some of the press and decided to try the novel.  I was soon caught up in this dysfunctional family's antics and kept coming back to the read to learn more about Pat and Tiffany.  The ending at first seemed to fall short of my expectations until I realized that I was looking for my own silver lining.  Good read.
B000OLROWC|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. The acting is good. The relationships between the karate kid and his teacher makes the movie.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I read most if not all of DeMille's novels and enjoy them all.  I like the continuity of characters that makes me feel reunited with old friends when I pick up the next read.  As a side bonus the Panther provides a description of places like Yemen that I otherwise wouldn't have known.  I enjoy Corey' sense of humor.  If you like DeMille,  he won't disappoint here.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|If there was an option for more stars, I would have chosen that! I truly enjoyed this trilogy and each bool brought new characters to love.  I highly recommend this one!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Unique work of Science Fiction - wonderful characterization!!!  I adored this book from the beginning to end.  It's got such different view of the future, and you will fall in love with every character from the very start.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I won't claim to know how historically accurate this is, but that's not important to this drama to grab the viewer's attention.  With all of the violence, you never know who is going to get &#34;axed&#34; or make it to the next episode; major and minor characters are always on the verge of death - some welcoming it for their chance to go to Valhalla.<br /><br />I suspect this will be a bigger hit with men than women, although the fact that Jax from Sons of Anarchy plays the lead role doesn't hurt with  female viewers like me.  Also worth noting are the strong female roles, starting with Legartha, &#34;Jax's&#34; wife.<br />Enough - go watch it and see for yourself if you don't get hooked!
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|I have to watch it every few years.  It's so interesting.  I adore science fiction, but so many movies/tv shows in this genre are awful.  This movie is extraordinary - quite a story and very good acting!
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Bought these to replace the old VHS tapes that were taking up too much space on the family room shelves.  Theyr'e DVDs.  What else is there to say?
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The Misremembered Man by Christina McKenna  very honestly written. I didn't like the abrupt ending however. Conclusion to the story was too short.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|He's amazing, the soul he puts into his songs make every penny worth it! Wish more singers were like him!
B002MCJZHS|5.0|When is first heard Islands off of this album, I loved it and had to get the whole album :) I had planned on buying both of the xx's album's but I love this one so much that i'm gonna spend a little more time just enjoying it before I buy the next one!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Game plays herky jerky.  Not clear instructions as to options/features.  I dumped it.  Not sure where the &#34;I pay cash comes up or where the free play is.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|challenging and a lot of fun....actually makes you think rather than just making random moves. not a bad game at all
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Whenever I have some time to kill, such as waiting for appointments, or someone to arrive, I play Bad Piggies.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed the film, although there were parts cut out of the book that were pretty necessary to the plot. Nonetheless, Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as was the scene stealing actress who portrayed Rue. Definitely worth your time to watch.
B00849F82E|5.0|I try to get anything written by Chesterton to read.  Excellent, in my view.  I know he is a popular read amongst my friends.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think this game is sooooooooooooooo fun.  It's definitely my favorite game on my kindle fire.  I have 46 games on it and dragonvale isn't even slow.  There are so many amazing games out there and this is definitely number one.  Thanks for reading my review.  Joeguydudemanthatrocks..............
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Very interesting and compelling story of a young man who looses his whole family while traveling by ship to Canada. The story starts off a little slow but gets to the point quicker than you would expect. The acting was good and the actions scenes are spectacular. I found nothing that I truly disliked about this movie but if you are not into viewing nature and odd ball adventures then this may not be the movie for you. All in all this was a &#34;Very good story!&#34;
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|There were too many advertisements, which interrupted my play... I deleted the program  and  am now plaing version that came on my tablet
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|One of the most valuable and constructive activities for the writer is to read and not only in the genre in which you write. Celebrate language, discover others and develop your craft while enjoying journeys into writer created worlds.<br /><br />In spite of the above advice, you only need to read one book on writing - Steven King's `On Writing'. His craftsmanship will take your breath away, his language so precise, I returned time and time again to re-read.<br /><br />King includes a series of incidents involving his health easily as terrifying as any of his novels because when King writes, he writes up the type of storm that in any other writer would be a slight breeze. Highly, highly recommend brilliance so pure and perfect delivered by someone who knows what it's like to spike rejection slips on his wall, but is living proof that skill, brilliance, ingenuity and tenacity will win out in the end.<br /><br />Perfect reading for all, but essential reading for writers.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I seriously enjoyed this - well written, not formulaic, and I immediately upon finishing it looked for more from the author.  Well?
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Best actor academy award was well deserved. Loved the political aspect- making deals and managing the end of the civil war in order to get ratification of the amendment to end slavery.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I liked The Sessions although it was difficult to watch in some spots -- the enormity of the main character's helplessness was painful to watch at times. But the performances were excellent and it is inspiring to know that it was based on a true story.  It is definitely worth a look.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like playing this game on just about anything except this tablet.  my fingers are to big I think. oh well
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it.I just want longer to earn Kim ,because I need only a few hundred more coins left. its still awesome.
B004U9J9GS|5.0|I am biased as I like Bourdain's style and wit. Has to be read to understand. Anthony often had me laughing out loud.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Hooked from the first episode. Jenna Hamilton is my hero. Sadie is a cumulation of all the mean girls in high school.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This game is simple to learn and has a fun physics element. It is perfect for getting kids into civil engineering!
B00BETX5PS|1.0|What a boring, stupid, awful movie this was. I thought Bond movies were supposed to be fun. This has got to be the worst Bond movie ever. Did not make it to the end.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this show but was very happy once I started. The basic story is like any law show with each episode helping someone through a trial. The interesting difference from these other shows is the over-arching story line of the family. I like the show!
B00BOLE7X0|2.0|If you like overly sentimental, cliche-ridden movies where the director leads you by the nose at every turn, you'll love this movie. If you like it when a director has so little respect for the audience he feels the need to insert maudlin orchestra swells EVERY time you're supposed to have an emotional response, you'll love this movie. If you think Tommy Lee Jones doing his same old schtick, except this time with a wig and cane, represents brilliant, scene-stealing acting, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you'll want your two hours back. I know I did.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|Probably good for kids, not for adults. Very boring, you play against the computer and it is VERY predictable. Played 2 games an had it all figured out.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is a decent movie. I like this type of movie---taut drama, especially 70s style. It's way overrated, but I enjoyed it. The fact that a movie like this won Best Picture just shows you how bad movies are in general. This is a decent movie. Workmanlike. Nothing wrong with it. But it's nothing special either.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The new Dr. is a little quirky and I really have to follow the storyline closely. Amy Pond is such a cutie.
B00BYOEMTQ|1.0|Didn't make it anywhere near the end. This is a very bad movie. Boring doesn't even begin to describe it.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|He is my favorite Dr!  Not too crazy about Donna as his traveling companion, can't say I was sad for her to be put back in time where she belonged.
B00908DDZM|5.0|i'm so happy with this album. every song has a good lyics & a great beat. i would & have recommended this one to all my friends and family. Macklemore & Lewis have their own style, yet all their songs don't sound the same. i love this album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well acted, well written, characters superbly developed. We have thoroughly enjoyed this season, and look forward to starting season three very soon.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie. If you like Tarantino films then you will not be disappointed in the movie. He even makes a cameo appearance.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|the chemistry between cooper and lawrence is wonderful, and makes this movie great.  everything else has been said about it by other reviewers..this is one of the best films I've seen in years.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|the graphics are really good.  I like all the animals. they are really cute! it is also very easy to get money.
B004AO1FF6|5.0|I have really enjoyed each season of Dr. Who. There were several little mentions of his past and numerous previous characters returning.  I thought Donna Noble was annoying at first, but I warmed up to her, it was nice having a companion who wasn't in love with him.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book surpassed my expectations! What a fun book.  I really enjoyed this and found myself really pulling for the main characters.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a light and entertaining read.
B0033BD280|5.0|For years i have heard the song take five and have wondered who made this. Finally at 47 i decided that's get find out and get this album. Wow is all i can say.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The imagery and photography in this movie was really great. At first the movie dragged, but once aboard the freighter, the movie held my interest throughout the rest.  I found it very thought provoking and continue to think about the themes of the movie afterward.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Disappointed that it does not stand in portrait orientation. It only stands in landscape. But it does hold it up well.
B00BF11STU|3.0|agree with other reviewers that this movie is fascinatingly slow moving for how exciting the real events were/are. the director actually managed to make it kind of boring. I've seen two documentaries on this event and both were significantly more interesting and dramatic.
B002O2THRO|4.0|This movie is romantic, fun, easy on the eyes (it is Robert Redford!) though I don't know how realistic it's portraying the era.  Great story from start to finish.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This a very good movie.  To the best of my knowledge it followed the real life sequence of a events.  It is a tribute to our daring, heroic, and patriotic Navy Seals who carried out the killing of the world's greatest terrorist, Osama Bin Laden.
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|We were captivated by the show. Acting was great and the story was very dark but original. Losts of twists and turns. Kevin Bacon plays a good alcoholic do-gooder tortured by his obsession of capturing Joe. My favorite character is his fellow FBI partner.
B0024FAG4Y|5.0|This older movie was redone using Blu-ray format.  It made seeing it again a real pleasure, almost like seeing it for the first time. We were happy that the DVD arrived within the estimated time and without any damage.
B00AW0DM8K|3.0|I found the storyline pretty good but it would help to be able to speak Japanese as there are to many words which you have to reference in order to figure out what the storyline is.  I also found that the deeper I went into the book, the more I skimmed the chapters dealing with Ruth.  The book became too technical and many of Ruth's chapters were boring and didn't hold my interest.<br />I came away with the feeling that the author was attempting to show the reader that she knew how to speak Japanese and that she had conducted a lot of research.<br /><br />I read the book because of the reviews but most certainly do not agree with the ratings.<br /><br />I would rate this book about two and one-half stars.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|If you like musicals you will like this one also.  I can't put it in the same category as West Side Story or other musicals where there was a  lot of dancing, i.e. Chicago but still very entertaining. The DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B0044XUZ9K|4.0|Illustrations are beautiful as well; they capture the adventurous,  as well as the darker sides of life on the high seas.
B001AITH50|2.0|A movie like this has to get you to suspend disbelief. It never did for me, so it was a gory, violent movie with good actors selling a product I never was convinced I needed.
B006P7IFKY|5.0|I've been looking for a physical copy of this album at local stores for a long time now.  Finally, I decided that I've looked long enough and I'd rather just get it digital so I can listen to it.  After all this time, it didn't let me down.  Love The Strokes.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|One of the best shows ever. Season 3 does not disappoint. Every episode keeps you glued to your seat. On to Season 4.
B009FXIICK|5.0|Zookeeper DX can and will easily scratch your bejeweled itch.  Also, the animals give it a cuter look than shiny gems.  This is definitely a great game that everyone can enjoy.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Great CD ... and the only down side is it took 10 years for this to see the light of day.  Great songs, wonderful playing and impeccable recording.  Great to have the fab Mr B back!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I've used a few note organizers out there and none of them worked as well for me as Notebooks.  As a musician, I have many books organized with lyrics and song ideas.  If you're a student, this is definitely a great way to take notes and keep them easily sorted out.  I really appreciate the fact that highlighting, copying, and pasting excerpts works well, unlike some of the other apps I've tried using.
B008BDZOZY|4.0|Long a fan of David Byrne's work w/ Talking Heads and his various solo and collaborations (notably w/ Eno), and in recent years I've been listening intently to all of St Vincent's disks, this pairing was greatly anticipated.  And, the material and presentation didn't disappoint.  Wonderful songs, great instrumentation (the brass band thing was a surprise and it worked), and the overall recording are perfect to frame their songs.  I look forward to see them this summer as they tour.
B00933JL0A|4.0|Fairly easy to understand and play, and the scenarios they give add decent challenge if you want something more.  Biggest gripe would be that once you expand your town enough to the point it becomes self sustaining and the people are happy, there's nothing else to do.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just finished watching 3 seasons for the second time.  I cannot wait for the fourth season to begin, although I will miss Mattew terribly.  The acting and writing is sensational, and Maggie Smith is wonderful!
0765325950|1.0|Her move to delay the ebook release was greedy and petty. Maybe The Ref had the right of it. \\"Your husband ain't dead, lady. He's hidin'.\\"
B00BQQM262|5.0|Watched with my 5 and 7 year old girls and we all enjoyed it!  Very funny and good moral lessons for not being a self centered person.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a moving story about a young boy fighting to survive. As a young boy, Ishmael, is forced to live a life of fear and survival, as he travels through many villages in effort to escape the rebel army. Not only is Ishmael on the move to find safety, but he is also focused on finding his family.<br /><br />While reading this novel I would continuously imagine myself in Ishmael's situation. What would I do? Would I be able to survive and fight through it they way he did? The more I thought about these questions, the more my respect for Ishmael continued to increase. The truth is, I would not have the courage to face the rebel army, or walk for miles with blistered feet not knowing if my next steep would be my last. I couldn't live through hearing the desperate cries of women as they're being raped, watching children being killed, or watching a village full of women, children and elders being burnt to the ground. The more I read and thought about these terrible situations, and how the army of men would laugh and reminisce about their disturbing actions, the more I became full of hatred. To think that this horrendous situation was taking place while us Americans were enjoying all the pleasures we have leaves me feeling heartbroken, but at the same time grateful. Grateful for the family I still have, the freedoms I've been given, and the life I get to live. It reminds me of how hard the people before me had to work in order for me to be living with the freedoms and opportunities I have, and that I should never take anything for granted.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading this moving story.  We hear about the terrifying events that take place throughout the world, but we never get to hear more than just what the news wants to tell us. You will get to fully understand the cruel events that took place in Sierra Leone through Ishmael's story of survival.
B004MPESSY|3.0|A lot of the transitions didn't make any sense to me.<br /><br />After the girl is molested, the molesters are outside the home in the woods.  The young woman leaves the home and walks to where they are so they can molest her again?  Weird!<br /><br />In the ending when the woman takes the Sheriff's little girl and the Sheriff hauls ass after them.  What did she do with the child?  It was a real shocker but disjointed making little or no sense most of the time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started horrible but ended good!  It took 30% before I even got into this book but after that I enjoyed it !
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Not the best movie ever, but doesn't pretend to want to be. For those of us in long-term relationships and 40, hysterical and real. There were multiple times I was laughing out loud.
0062238868|5.0|Interesting account of a soldiers first hand war experience. Well written and keeps you turning the pages. Have recommended this book to many and have let friends borrow it too!!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I rated this booked based on the point and how I liked it. It was good and I understood the point. There were adventures, love stories, and some sad parts too. My favorite character was Beth, but I think I  most like Jo. Little Women was an excellent book that I would recommend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I look at it frequently.  I don't always comment but I do enjoy seeing the pictures and reading what others have written.
B004QX07G4|1.0|The book had no story.  It is just  random thoughts and ideas.  I never finished the book it was so bad.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I don't have anything t say that is negative.  We are able to access Amazon easy and it allows us to view things we would not otherwise be able to do.
159420411X|5.0|This was an excellent book and makes several good points about using statistics to make predictions.  I liked the illustrations used.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This is an exceptional story of men from two entirely different worlds who find a way to be completely &#34;in touch&#34; with one another. Wickedly funny too. Highly recommended.
B008MEM24S|1.0|This game was cool because it makes your brain really work!<br />and it makes me want to play it every day<br /><br />!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I love this!  I usually time everything and this gives me the opportunity to have several timers going at the same time.  I use this every day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have enjoyed season two as much as the first season. The characters and story line keeps me wanting more !
B008220DGE|1.0|As a big Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix fan, I couldn't wait to see this film.<br />I was patient, confident that at some point the movie would be worth my time.<br />What a disappointment that it only got worse.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Keeps you coming back for more, outstanding job by Kevin Bacon, good character development.  Had not heard anything about this series, definitely  two thumbs up.
0307352153|4.0|When I started reading Quiet, I expected the book to be a series of personal narratives that both displayed the challenges that introverts faced and the ways they overcame those challenges.  While those stories are present in Quiet, I was surprised to find the book contained a substantial amount of psychological research.  Even though I would've liked a few more personal stories, I appreciated Cain's skillful merging of the empirical and the anecdotal.  The approach she took added both depth and context to the personal stories, thereby making them more memorable.  The approach also bolstered Cain's arguments that introverts' behaviors shouldn't be discounted and that their contributions are as important to society's advancement as those made by extroverts (and maybe even more important).  Cain presents these arguments in a manner befitting of an introvert:  with understatement that doesn't disguise her passion for the subject.<br /><br />I'm not quite ready to put Quiet in the \\"world-changing\\" category as some of its most ardent advocates do.  But, I do agree that Quiet is a well-written, convincing argument for the value of introversion in today's world.  Introverts need little motivation to read this book.  But, even extraverts would find it worth their while to take a few hours away from socializing and read this book to get a better grasp on their somewhat misunderstood introverted companions.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Horse is fun so far. Wish you could do more.  Easy but fun. I am notna horse girl but I love this game.
B00BF11STU|1.0|This movie could have been made in half the time it was. It is extremely slow and bloated with its own importance. The writing was terrible and the acting was even worse. And it's near impossible to connect with or care about the lead female character.<br /><br />If you are bothered by torture, do not watch this movie. There is a lot of it and it's gruesome. But, from my perspective, the real torture is actually having to watch this movie.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When Google announced that they were retiring Reader, I was disappointed like many. Feedly was recommended by Gizmodo and after giving it a shot, I agree. This is a great replacement with a much more modern and beautiful interface with several viewing options like a list view which is similar to Reader, and a magazine style layout with large pictures. It also seamlessly imports your reader feeds. I'm a huge fan now!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!<br /><br />It moves at a great pace and there was never a lull. I loved that real footage from the time was used. Great writing and really great acting. And I adored the Ben Affleck character. In fact, I really liked most every character in the movie. And though I knew how it ended, I sat riveted the entire movie because it was told so well.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Argo\\" do yourself a favor and watch it - you won't be disappointed.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Still Alice was a well written book. It gives the reader a better insight of the struggles a person with Alzheimer's deals with. Maybe after reading this book people will be able to recognize symptoms in family members and get them help sooner.
1939416019|1.0|I've found a number of inexpensive books and series of heroic fantasy since buying my Kindle. Some were good, a few were great, some were just okay. This was the first one that was really, really bad. Apparently the author has been on a 'review drive' and it conned me. I'll read more reviews before plunking down my cash in the future. What's wrong with A Quest for Heroes? Pretty much everything. The lead character, Thor, is a total Mary Sue. But even that can be overcome with an interesting story and so can the constant fantasy tropes that are thrown at us. What can't be overcome is bad writing. The baddies are all bad, the goodies are all good. The hero meets his love interest and while I could believe he'd fall for her at first sight, it's totally unrealistic that she'd fall for a boy 2 years younger than herself and moon over him like a teen pin-up. All she does is have one look at him and she's moping around the place with a trail of floating hearts - it's enough to make you gag. Thor meets a couple of other boys and within 24 hours, he's thinking of them as his brothers - despite the fact that his real brothers treat him like crap and he'd probably not consider being a 'brother' to be a great thing. He was raised on a farm where he had to do the dirty work and all of a sudden he objects to having to shovel animal poop?<br />The author also chooses to have a gay villain. Normally, I don't care about the sexuality of a character one way or the other, in this case, his gayness almost seems to be part of his villainy. He and his foppish comrade 'cry like girls' when things go wrong and basically prance around like sissies while they work on their dastardly plot. There's even a cottage in the woods where a witch resides! Not to mention what is basically the sword in the stone.<br />The thing is, the author actually had a couple of interesting ideas with this kingdom encircled in a ring and might have been able to do a few fun things with it, but she's simply not upto the task. If I thought the sequels would get better, I might peruse them, but I just can't imagine going any further into this train wreck. I could probably write a better ending myself. Probably turn Thor gay and have him wind up with one of his two new 'brothers' and then start a war to overthrow the 'rightful' heir. At least that would be a twist!
B00BVYKWJI|2.0|Jeremy Irons just doesn't bring home the bacon here, not enough to rescue a series that had the budget to 'one-up' the 2011 Borgias from Canal+ with a better cast and lots more skin action.  With so many good examples of what we want in hysterical fiction such as the Tudors and Game of Thrones, why does series seem so flacid, so limp, so pale?  A big disappointment on the level of the Showtime's Camelot (2011).
B0081336FO|5.0|Mind stimulating with an excellent story line and cast.  I listen to it while on treadmill and time literally flies.
B000GOZ0ZK|5.0|good shark movie ..i did enjoy watching it on my kindle...i also have the movie on dvd so you really can see i do like this movie...it is entertaining and can keep you on the edge of your seat at times...but it is not overwhelming...
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Even as these characters mature, it never really gets old.  I love this show.  I know these mad scientists. My favorite trope of the season: for Christmas, instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, Leonard had to leave Santa a research paper, and he  knew Santa had been there, because in the morning it was graded.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|its a good movie..really feel at times that you are in that sub deep down in the ocean...good war movie... i did see it before and just wanted to see it agin ...i do enjoy the movies from the 40's..especially world war ll movies...this one the men speak german with english on the screen...but it is still a very good movie...good entertainment..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Kindle doesn't come with a calculator, so I downloaded this. Nice simple calculator that's works great. No problems so far.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Very well written. I just found the story depressing although it is worth the read. If you are unsure about reading don't be .
B008U0FJF8|5.0|I only came to know of this music through my local jazz radio, KBEM-FM. The tune &#34;Beats & Bounce&#34; (misidentified by the DJ as &#34;Short Ride&#34;) captured my attention immediately, the trumpet line reminding me of Jon Hassell's work. Taking the chance of buying music based upon on tune, I separated myself from hard-earned cash. I was not disappointed. The sequence Walking by Your Side/Imprint/Short Ride/Beats & Bounce/Slowing the Tides is some of the best music I have heard in years. Highly recommended!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Not only headlines but detailed reports for US & World which are categorized by region.  Better than the newly redesigned USA Today app.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I like the content of the series and the story line.  I think the action it adequate and not extremely violent.  I find that netflix delivers the content in better quality with no pauses and interruptions though.  I would wish that were corrected.  Overall  I like the series and would recommend it.
B0041D843M|5.0|In The China Study T.Colin Campbell explains not only the findings from The China Study itself but also the dysfunctional relationship between science,industry and government which in effect gives the power for control of public health information to the very businesses which profit from encouraging the standard American animal food based diet. Even if you do not want to follow a whole foods plant based diet it is better to make that decision after having the facts.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Beautiful visuals, very funny dialogue, some touching family moments.  Not up there with Pixar's best, but a lot of studios would be happy to make a CGI-animated flick like this.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love this topic and authors science based background. It's well written and exciting to read! I know you will enjoy it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Good game, keeps my kids absorbed for hours at a time.  Only drawbacks are the constant sales pitches for upgrade packs and such.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|so much fun! I love it you can battle and conquer. any thing . and it is a fun way to make friends.
B005XDHNF4|4.0|My girlfriend bought this and divided all the pieces between gift bags at the hen's night, then gave the instructions to the bride and everyone helped assemble it. Fun!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|At least that annoying manifestation of M as plucky veddy British matron gets hers in the end. Otherwise a piece of junk, embarrassing on so many levels--the new Q character appeals to the 6 year olds in the audience, Javier Bardem appeals to no one but Javier Bardem, and perhaps his mother, and the nostalgic crutch of the Goldfinger car is just so so so sad. And the action sequences are boring. Really, almost as basd as Man w/Golden Gun, but at least that had a killer dwarf.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|As a videogame designer, I struggle to understand why some games catch on and others don't. Beyond games though, this is an invaluable read for anyone trying to make ideas that catch on, at whatever scale.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I started watching this series into the second season and became an instant fan.  Now having seen Season 1 from the beginning I understand better the relationships. I will continue to watch. It’s great to watch.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I haven't got to use every timer yet but I am looking forward to using this on a daily basis.
0060899190|5.0|I had to make myself stop turning to the next page so I could get dinner ready the first night. Some of the postcards are funny, others make you think and still others will make you cry.<br />I usually now buy Kindle versions of books I read but this one needs to be hard cover. It simply would not have the same impact.<br /><br />This book is amazing...  read it!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The plot was fast paced, and well planned out. Lots of unexpected turns.  Character well developed and believable. Evolving over time.
030758836X|4.0|This is not your ordinary story.  Very creative, twisted and dark, almost disturbing.  There are some very funny quips, with an almost stream of consciousness narration giving us an interesting perspective to the two main characters.  The first part of the book was really disturbing to me, good, but distubing.  The second part made me feel (oddly) better about the story.  The last part was the most difficult to accept and the ending was awfully abrupt to me.  Overall a really good book with excellent writing.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|easy to use and find what you want yes i recamend it because it is perfict for tablets as a mater of fact i have recamended it
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Liam Neeson was great in Taken and Taken 2 so I was not sure if I would be so lucky to find another great show, but I was. I loved this movie too.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This movie had a lot on &#34;artistic license&#34; to anyone who was taught history about Lincoln but it was somewhat entertaining but should not be taken as factual.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Ireally can not say enough about this movie. I thought the first Expendables movie was the best, but this was every bit as good. I love this movie!

B0062P3392|5.0|What can I say! other than what a great movie! Jason Statham knows his stuff when capturing the attention of his audience!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Was looking for something similar to the Pocket Sword App and this works fine, easy to switch from passage to passage, and love the multiple versions - which are also easy to switch between.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|Jason Statham is one of my new favorate actors and I love most of his movies even if some of them are really out there, this is his style and what defines him. He is great!
0345803507|3.0|Mr. Grey has finally settled. He's still possessive--still a control freak--but his coming-to-terms with Anastasia--to take care of each other, to love each other, for better or worse--inspires a different sort of dynamic between the two returning characters. Their relationship isn't intense, it's just bipolar; this is best displayed in this last installment of the Fifty Shades of Grey series.<br /><br />I was highly annoyed by Anastasia's weird internal conflict; she wants her kinky ways with Christian, trying to adjust to his lifestyle, but breaks down every time he obliges--crying it's too much and it's too painful. Make up your mind, woman! Everything is repetitive as always. It's like EL James copy-and-pasted her sex scenes into each other because most of them have the exact same wording and structure, but different venues, e.g. bed, table, aircraft, toilet (yes, she went there... kinky!).<br /><br />Ana and Christian's roller-coaster ride of a relationship isn't even dramatic or heartfelt anymore; it's just exasperating. I'm also not sure how the heck they are so deeply committed and in lurve after having known each other for only two months. Two. Months. Anastasia doesn't even know what Christian does for a living, for crying out loud! All she knows is that he's some hoity-toity entrepreneur. I have suspicions he's an underground slave auctioneer but sadly, this tidbit isn't actually revealed in the book.<br /><br />SPOILER START: And they don't get a prenup??/ He's a BILLIONAIRE and they don't get a prenup because he trusts her so much. Just let that sink in for about fifteen seconds. This series should be relabeled as fantasy, not romance. SPOILER END<br /><br />The ending... ugh. Grossly idealized, but I one thing I liked is how the book concludes exposing Christian's full story. Getting to know him so deeply was probably the best part of the novel. His love for Ana is clouded with overprotectiveness and insecurity, but it's still deep nonetheless. The heart of the dilemma is his need for control and his need for Anastasia. She believes the two aren't mutually exclusive, but even so, they just might be his ruin. These emotions are brutal, and they're actually sweet--knowing where they come from, but really: that's the only thing that kept me reading.<br /><br />Stylistically, you guessed it! Pretentious big words thrown around carelessly, but otherwise very basic, very weak. It's a shame to erotica writers that James identifies herself as one of them.<br /><br />Pros: Great character-building // Christian's past<br /><br />Cons: Let's put it like this: Book 1 should never have happened, Book 2 is dumb, and Book 3 is dumber. That's all you have to know<br /><br />Love: Real quotes from the book that I needed to share with you:<br /><br />He looks so sexy and genial.<br />(What?)<br /><br />He's so adroit.<br />(What?)<br /><br />I'm so aroused.<br />(I would be, too, if I orgasmed at the slightest breeze.)<br /><br />(Two reasons to shoot me now:)<br />1. Mr. Orgasmic was using his fine-motor sexing skills on me.<br />2. Why are his feet so hot?<br /><br />(Accurately displaying the length of Anastasia's attention span, or lack thereof:)<br />I will never understand this man. Hmm--this cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e is delicious.<br />I glance at my watch: 2:15 p.m. He should be here soon. My tea is cold... Ugh!<br /><br />Verdict: Don't bother reading the actual book, because I can summarize the entire thing up for you here: sex; fight; makeup sex; fight; makeup sex; fight; fight fight; flight; yell; pregnancy scare; panic; OMG; major fight; weep; \\"hi,\\" I breathed, \\"hi,\\" he whispered back; makeup sex; happily every after. I really had high hopes for Fifty Shades Freed after liking the second book in the series so much, but alas, EL James disappoints.<br /><br />6 out of 10 hearts (3 stars): Satisfying for a first read, but I'm not going back.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by Edenfantasys in exchange foran honest and unbiased review (thank you!).d unbiased review (thank you!).
B00407PNY2|4.0|I ordered this movie after hearing it mentioned, thinking it would be good, but it did not keep my interest.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Once again, Diana Gabaldon has managed to continue her wonderful historical fiction series with Drums of Autumn.  This particular title focuses more on Claire and Jamie's daughter, Brianna and her exploits as she returns in time to meet her father.  Jamie is still a force to be reckoned with as Brianna's fiance learns the hard way.  Gabaldon is a true story teller.  Can't wait to get started on book five, The Fiery Cross!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Excellent movie that was full of action and what a great cast with all my favorate actors. My hat is off the them all for a great movie.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Will not print emails. Said I had to get PtintBot Pro, but t hat is not comparable with KR. Amazon needs to have a printing app for KF. How many years does it take.
B001OSIV62|5.0|From the title and description, I did not expect much from this movie.  I taped it first on my DVR and it just sat there for months until I saw it on Amazon prime when I was looking for something to watch.  So I started it and the more I watched, the more interesting it was.  I love history and learning from other people's experiences.  Philippe Petit really fascinated me.  They interview him and others in present time, as well as through decades old footage.  It was so interesting to learn what was going through his mind, how he first saw a picture of the buildings being planned and wanted to cross between them before they were even built!  Then later, how he took several trips to New York to investigate it and find a way to do it.  Eventually he found people to help him sneak 450 lb wire past security guards, and figured out a way to stretch the wire between the buildings.  I knew in the end he was going to do it, but all the details and motivations that led up to it were truly fascinating the way it was all told.  Even after the event, watching how he dealt with the notoriety of an awe struck woman, and his openness about all that.  It just made the whole story such a nice look into the life of someone else who I will never be.  Truly, probably mostly because of its uniqueness, this was one of the best documentaries I think I have ever watched.  Somebody should make this story into a feature length movie for the big screen theaters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game! The kids can play for hours!! So many different games to play. Could not have asked for a better selection!
B004UPANGM|1.0|I chose a one star rating, because, Bruce Campbell is a better actor than the writers of this disaster allowed him to be. If, I were him, I would buy every copy of this movie, and burn it. The whole movie was nothing but a complete lack of skills on the part of the writers. I don't know how much was spend on their budget, but, they could have used it more wisely.
B001NB52PS|5.0|This is the quintessential U2 album that is a must for every music collection. It is occasionally raw rock (such as the Refugee and Seconds) and in turn touching (like 40).<br /><br />War takes you back to the real music of the 1980&#34;s, no neon, long hair or spandex... just really amazing rock music. I replaced an old tape cassette with a MP3 download 3 days ago and have been listening to it over and over ever since.<br /><br />If you love, like or even have just heard of U2... you should buy this album.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|For first time director Dave Grohl, this documentary was certainly a labor of love.  And that feeling resonates throughout this film.  Grohl currently with Foo Fighters and other collaborations, cut his musical teeth with the acclaimed Nirvana.  They first recorded in the Van Nuys, California legendary studio, Sound City.<br /><br />Grohl takes us back to the early days (late `60's) where their first customers were Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham (&quot;Nicks Buckingham&quot; album).  Later, Mick Fleetwood of British blues band Fleetwood Mac remembered hearing the duo at the studio as he was scouting recording sites in the U. S.  That led to the combination that became music icons.  This and many similar stories are introduced along with the people involved, musicians and the talented owners and employees of the studio.<br /><br />Even after computers and digital technology began to transform the music business, analog purists returned to Sound City which did little to change its ways.  This led to their eventually demise unfortunately.  Grohl for his part bought the one-of-a-kind mixing board that everyone loved.  The Neve's board is certainly a central character in the story and Grohl even interviews designer Rupert Neve who provides technical rationale for the design which sails right past Dave's head.  He supplies some hilarious subtitles as to what he was thinking.<br /><br />The film has its share of emotional moments as the studio is in its last throws but perhaps the most poignant is when Rick Springfield reminisces about his relationship with Joe Gottfried who guided Springfield's early career.  Springfield unexpectedly left for greener pastures which caused great distress to Gottfried who died in 1991.  This is a wonderful documentary, crafted with care and includes interviews with some of the greats in rock `n roll most of whom are still at it.  Watch for it on the Oscar list next January.<br /><br />The fine 1080p transfer comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and looks very good.  Much of the film includes archival segments include amateur tape, VHS and other.  It is about as good as it gets.  There is no use of compression that I could identify.  Colors and clarity are good.  The audio defaults to a PCM 2.0 Stereo mix for some reason.  Most will want to opt to the lossless LPCM 5.1 mix which gets the most out of the many extended recording performances.  The film highlights the recording of a new album recorded at Grohl's 606 Studio featuring the Neve board.  &quot;Sound City - Real to Real&quot; is a great album that you will have to buy separately.ratio and looks very good.

B001TH16DS|4.0|The disks arrived in great shape. Happy with my purchase. Only complaint that I could have is that it took a while and I had intended them as a birthday gift. The processor was out sick and so the order wasn't processed for about a week. But i life stuff happens and the disks are as promissed.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album and the idea behind this movement.  The music and videso make me smile and dance and cry and sing along.  The idea behind this visionary approach is based on a creative and pro-active approach to fostering peace in the world, and what the producers have created is an overwhelming testament to the power of music.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Downloaded this app after trying other cleaners for my Kindle Fire which were weak at best. This app is great. Works well and even Albert's you when your storage is getting low so you can avoid being disappointed when trying to download an app or a book and then finding you don't have the space. Highly recommend it.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I'm a huge Adam Lambert fan.  His voice is amazing, his stage presence compelling, and his song-writing talent fresh and nuanced.  I'll buy anything he records.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Yet, another well put together action packed movie. As always there is a love story with massive barriers in between them while all along being in a war. Great movie. Must see.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|The Best Joe Bonamassa concert great jamin....  Love  the dvd all the way..  Joe jams all the way, the very best..
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The plot the good and the ending keeps you on edge but the novel overall is poorly written and it drags a bit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is fun because on a rainy day when you have not anything else to do you can play Solitaire!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Considering the fact that it was written by an amateur about her  horrible experiences for years, it was a good book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season three was a huge come back after a merely decent second season.  My love of the serious is back to full force.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|A very fun and creative game. Pros its easy to play. Cons it needs a update. I think DragonVale is a great game.
B001AUKUS6|4.0|As a kid growing up in the 80's, my first concert was Ratt.  They are the epitome of classic Big Hair 80's bands.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I realized why I grew up more tolerant than some people around me.  Star Trek is a classic for all time.
B00004Y6NK|3.0|This album wasn't the greatest, but Eric Clapton is one of the greatest.  From Cream, to Derek and the Dominoes, Clapton will be remembered for decades to come.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I'm a big horror fan and this was a really great, creative movie.  I've never seen anything like it and they did a great job on both the story and the scares.  Even though it has kids in it, I would NOT show this move to anyone under the age of 14.  It's a definite nightmare inducer.  But, if you're over 14 and love a good horror story, well shot and told - this one's for you.
B005D643PO|5.0|I have always enjoyed Dexter and this was a great season to watch.  The quality of the HD was worth the purchase and I've had no issues with it at all.  Worked perfectly.
B009JCPM5S|2.0|Laughing out loud isn't what you should do while watching a horror flick, but that's exactly what I found myself doing several times during this film. From the acting to the writing to the &#34;special effects&#34;, this film completely fails at what it was intended to be...a scary movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love using this app for my kindle fire HD. Its great to use while reading and just sleeping to the bass of the brown noise and fan option together.  Mixing in the binaural beats helps too.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Okay, so I will admit that my favorite Bonamassa albums are the live shows.  Both Albert Hall and Beacon Theatre were excellent in my book, but this blows both of those, and all of the other live albums I have out of the water.  Joe really delivered on this one.  The band he put together for this show was awesome, and in fact when I saw JB live last week in Denver, Arlan Oscar Schierbaum was playing in place of Rick Melick which was fine with me as I thought Arlan's lead in on Jockey Full of Bourbon on the DVD captured the spirit of the song perfectly.<br /><br />Joe's continually improving singing coupled with his absolute mastery of the guitar comes through clear on this album.  He and the band really shine on acoustic renditions of Dust Bowl, Athens to Athens, Driving Towards the Daylight (completely fabulous), Jockey Full of Bourbon, Black Lung Heartache, and Sloe Gin.<br /><br />If you are a Bonamassa fan you will probably enjoy this DVD, but remember it is an acoustic album so don't expect the screaming Gibson guitars that you are used to...just sit back and enjoy the true beauty of the songs that JB plays.
B00AEFY44Y|5.0|Received a great copy of &#34;one of my favorite movies ever.  Really enjoyed watching it on &#34;Blu-Ray.&#34;  Recommend buying this one if you enjoyed the VHS.
0671449028|3.0|Let me say first that I enjoyed this book overall, and I really like the author - we have a bunch of her books.<br /><br />I give this review 3 stars instead of 5 for a simple issue: the book explains how to do things in the wrong way.  Short synopsis: The author writes how a bunch of kids get play and get ready for bed.  It's all great and cute.  The kids brush their teeth, take baths and so forth.  The issue comes next: Right after all of this, the kids go exercise and THEN go to bed.<br /><br />I know, I know, I'm being a hard ass.  That will be a common criticism of me, I'm sure.  But I know no one that bathes, brushes their teeth, goes down to the basement to exercise, and then hops right into bed.  My wife tells me to \\"relax, it's a kid's book\\".  I say \\"I'm relaxed, but I read this book to our son 300+ nights a year and he's being taught the wrong progression.\\"<br /><br />That said, the book is great, the author is great.  If the progression was proper, I'd give this 5 stars.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Over 6 seasons, this entertaining series had more drama than any 3 other programs.  I thoroughly enjoyed the final season.
B0094AH3OI|3.0|There is a new generation of viewers who don't have the context of the Verdi singing tradition, never heard of Tebaldi, Corelli or Del Monaco and couldn't care less about whether a singer is a spinto-shminto or not; if they sound good and look fine all is well. This review is not for them. As Sir John Falstaff puts it, \\"Tutto declina\\".<br /><br />The booklet that comes with the Tutto Verdi box has an article by Roger Parker that discusses in its final paragraphs what may happen to Verdi's music in the next 100 years. He argues that the revival of earlier composers, particularly the flood of Handel, has brought new types of star singers, ones lacking the necessary heft for Verdi. \\"...if the vogue for lighter, more flexible voices continues, then more and more Verdi operas will become virtually unperformable\\". \\"In a vocal world in which countertenor Philippe Jaroussky has the vogue once enjoyed by, say, tenor Franco Corelli, the writing would seem to be on the wall.\\"<br /><br />Hallelujah! Rejoice, for this Forza, which inaugurated the 2011 season in Parma brings us a taste of that future envisaged by Mr. Parker (why was I under the impression that this future has already arrived 20 years ago?) We are truly blessed here with a cast that is matched and consistent in being miscast in roles too heavy for them. Forza is not Ballo or even Aida where you have a little more leeway as far as vocal weight. Yes, there were lyrics who stretched their resources for Forza, but the bar has never been set this low. The work is presented complete; all the cuts in the score are reopened.<br /><br />Dimitra Theodossiou (making her role debut as Leonora) makes many lovely sounds, but her voice lacks the weight, body, amplitude, stamina and low notes required. She resorts to a lot of soft singing, falsetto cooing and any number of tricks, aided and abetted by these gottverfluchte body-mics. In the last few years her voice has been showing signs of  serious decline and she can barely keep a musical line, let alone legato. She is also not exactly fun to watch and her ideas of acting are borrowed from silent horror films.<br /><br />Aquiles Machado (making his role debut as Don Alvaro) forces most of the time and as a result is monochromatic and lacks enough amplitude. His top is strained and the phrasing is often crude and the tone robbed of its beauty. His bright voice simply sounds wrong for Don Alvaro.<br /><br />Vladimir Stoyanov fares a little better as Don Carlo di Vargas; he gives a commanding performance and gets the only mid-performance standing ovation, but the opening of the cuts in the score tax him and he tires.<br /><br />Roberto Scandiuzzi sounds underpowered as Padre Guardiano and Mariana Pentcheva is another ugly-voiced Preziosilla (they often are). Carlo Lepore's Fra Melitone is the best member of the cast; his voice has body, amplitude and authority.<br /><br />Maestro Gianluigi Gelmetti is entrusted with navigating this ship of fools safely to the shore. He does exactly that, providing support for the singers by making sure that the orchestra does not cover them and keeping the tempo at a comfortable pace, while keeping some sense of structure. I don't envy him; if he weren't burdened with this cast he could have conducted a great Forza just like he gave us a great Ballo (and many other first rate readings).<br /><br />According to all Italian critics this production was a great success. That includes one that I know personally, and she is no fool, she is usually hard to please. Though most conceded that Machado was miscast, they usually singled out La Theodossiou for special praise, and they mostly liked the rest of the cast. They can't all be wrong.<br /><br />So you wasted your time reading this negative review, because I must be wrong and the cast was not half as bad as I claim here.<br /><br />But wait a second - it's true that it is very difficult to assess the singing with body-mics, but there are clips from the audience onyoutube. Watch Theodossiou's \\"Pace, pace mio dio\\" from this production here and judge for yourself: see link 1 at the comment section below.<br /><br />What is this? Is \\"Pace, pace\\" supposed to be all mezza voce, piano and pianissimo? Erratic dynamics masquerading as artistic expression? Vergogna! This is not a question of taste or subtle nuances - this clip shows that Theodossiou is simply incapable of singing this role. This is sad and pathetic. Yet there is no doubt she was a big success with her public. On the last performance in the run she granted requests for an encore. What was going on?<br /><br />Theodossiou has a fiercely loyal fan base in Italy. They occupied mostly the stalls where much of the applause started. There were speculations on the Italian blogosphere that the loggionisti did not boo because it would have been too much work to boo almost the entire cast. There were (contested) testimonials that as soon as the curtain went down the loggionisti stood up and left. It does sound on this blu-ray like the loggionisti went on a strike - they are unusually quiet. Check this link to the final curtain calls in the penultimate performance. It's shot from gallery and at 4:00 minutes you can hear someone's dismissive reaction (in Italian) to the public's loud acclaim of Theodossiou - \\"they exggerate\\": see link 2 at the comment below.<br /><br />You could say \\"someone said, so what\\" and you would be right. More research is required to clarify this issue...<br /><br />I think there was something else at play: three of the six principals (including Machado and Theodossiou) were late replacements. Forza singers don't grow on trees. A few months earlier the booing made two principals leave another Parma production. Questions were raised in the press what is the point of the Verdi Festival at all. If they started booing here that could have meant the end of this expensive production and a financial loss for their beloved house, at a time when the house needed a big \\"success\\", at least in the press. Everyone knows their part in this game.<br /><br />When I saw all the extras writhing in slow motion I had a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and checked my Thaïs blu-ray from Turin 2009 - yep, the same genius, Stefano Poda. There is no point trying to describe the regie - you'll either like it or hate it, just like with that Thaïs. I don't have a problem with the director's mishigas, I rather enjoyed it. Unlike Thaïs there is, alas, no nudity here. Most of the time there is some connection between the libretto and what happens on stage. The director even seems to have found a solution for the crowd scenes. This is not German regie. There is a unique blend here of imposing esthetics and a wacky, inexplicable but strangely beautiful mise-en-scene. It's like a psychotic hallucination or a bizarre nightmare.<br /><br />The sound engineers used body mics as usual. Body mics are a scourge that has to go but only gets worse. My dilemma in these reviews is that I have the vague impression that most readers are just bored with discussions of this issue. More significantly, if I come out too strongly against the recordings in these series for body miking, I single them out unjustly, because this problem is now pervasive - body mics are now used in the majority of new releases (and are becoming impossible to detect) - so I held my peace.<br /><br />Ma basta! \\"For Zion's sake I shall not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest...\\" Body mics kill any sense of ambiance, placement on stage, hall acoustic or voice projection. They sound artificial and dead, and all for what purpose? That the singers will always sound center stage and upfront? We have to come out, speak up and fight this trend!youtube.

B004UID2LC|3.0|The part of the app which allows you to view You Tube videos works fine.  The the part they hide is that you can't download with the free version (even though it's called &#34;FREE You Tube Downloader.)  You have to upgrade to the paid version.  Pretty much NOT truth in advertising.
B0098VYMFQ|3.0|A coming of age movie for french ladies of the night and day.  Not really any unique twists of plot or academy award winning performances for the best organism.  But, if you haven't been to Paris in the spring, summer, fall, etc., this is worth watching if you don't have anything else to do.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because a different actor plays Jane Seymore than in the first season & I just liked her better. The whole story is wonderful & portrays the people quite accurately. I've read many historical fiction books about Henry VIII, his wives & other members of royalty in different countries & I think Showtime did a great job w/ the Tudors.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is a beautiful collection of songs, especially since I'm a fan of the show, Nashville. Only wish it was longer, it is missing the song, Fade into You, and the MP3 version is of no use to me. That is disappointing, I hope the Season Two CD, will be longer. I am very happy with the CD.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Best games I  have played.  Love the challenge. This is my third cut the rope purchase.  Got through this one too quick. Not as many games to play like the first one I bought.  Please keep them coming.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Serial killing horror plus complex human relationships.  Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy are incredible actors and their chemistry cannot be beat.  With Gina Torres and Laurence Fishburne thrown in, this is a show you absolutely must see.  The cinematography and sets are amazing too.  There is no bad to this show.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A most interesting and detailed story of the preparation for and the assault on the compound that Bin Laden and his family was in hiding in Pakistan.... which was close to the Pakistani Military Academy.  The reader will not be able to put the book down until he or she gets to the place in the book where all of our troops have completed the mission and returned safely to base.  Kudos to our troops and, as we say in the Navy, &#34;Bravo Zulu&#34; to those involved in the mission.  .
B008S4FZHI|5.0|The Bone Bed keeps all it's secrets until the very end.  Brilliant climax! Again, Patricia Cornwell's done Kay Scarpetta proud.<br /><br />I bought the first Scarpetta Novel back in 1991 and have read every one since.  I still enjoy the characters with the all their trials and tribulations.  The storylines still intrigue and fascinate me and I just can't put the books down once I get them.

B00AMBM9MO|4.0|It's really funny, but not for the kids.  You have to love the Boston backdrop, and the lack of tragfic is a real fantasy.
B006VY0SEM|5.0|A fantastic album. This was one of the few albums I have ever bought out of impulse after hearing one song of hers, and I love it. She has the most beautiful voice, stark, blunt lyrics, and cute little melodies. I really hope to hear more from her.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I so enjoyed all the characters. This story made me start planning a trip to Ireland,and to maybe sit in a pub and have a pint. I'm sorry the story is over...loved every drop of it!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I love this movie.  I loved Alien and I like this one even more.  This one has a grander story than Alien and to me is more interesting.  Spoiler Warning:  The black goo is more dangerous than the xenomorphs and more interesting because depending on what organic creature you combine it with it will have a different monster result.  The Fifield mutant seemed stronger than a xenomorph.  It also seemed easier to kill a facehugger over the hammerpede or snake like alien since that thing can regenerate so quickly.  A lot of people say that the biologist was very dumb, but I didn't mind that because there are people in real life who confront dangerous animals without fear.  For example \\"The Grizzly Man\\" Timothy Treadwell (May he rest in peace) was similar to that.  Not dumb in my opinion but fearless and very fascinated with animals especially a new alien speices. That's how that biologist struck me.  He also told Fifield to stay calm and I feel that's how most animal handlers have to be in order not to rile up the animal.  I also thought there were no plot holes.  Of course the movie didn't answer all the questions, but it did it in the right way, leaving it to your imagination.  There are also planned sequels to the movie to answer many questions.  The scientists Holloway and Shaw come to the conclusion based on ancient wall carvings/drawings all over the world (I've seen youtube documentaries about that subject) that all pretty much appear the same illustrate man communicating with aliens.  Or an alien pointing to planets.  They search (probably with high tech equipment) the universe and come across a galaxy that is similar to ours and form the same set of planets like the ancient cave artwork.  And the planet they land on LV-223 is not the same planet as the one in Alien which was LV-426 so that's why it doesn't exactly end with someone in the jockey chair with their chest burst outwards.  There are other examples, but basically I think this movie was perfectly pacedand had no plot holes.  I liked all the characters, every one of them and I enjoyed the script by Damon Lindelof.  Great movie, I hope more people will realize it's genius over time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for grandkids to play and time wasting (Dr appt etc) I take my kindle everywhere I know I will have wait time
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. It kept me watching pretty closely to see what was going to happen next. You will find yourself rooting for Django even though he shots and blows up everything in sight. There is a ton of gore in this movie, not for anybody with a week stomach or who can't laugh it off. I felt it was an excellent portrayal of a modern day comedic cowboy.
0345803507|5.0|I couldn't put the books down.It really empowered women.Book one introduced you to the characters,two was a bit boring,and three brought everything together.Very suspenseful! A great read for all women.You notice I said &#34;women?&#34;It is too intense for a teenager and they may take it the wrong way.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love John Corey!  He reminds me of the characters Bruce Willis typically plays.  Nelson Demille provides so much insight in his writing.  In The Panther, Demille gives an opportunity to understand some of the Mid Eastern culture and their perception of the Western world.
0596522347|5.0|Once you start reading it , a deeply rooted change will be triggered, culminated by your very next presentation for sure will be very unique. Still you need to be knowledgable with the software u r using whether keynote or PowerPoint .
B005HSG3U6|5.0|great deal, highly recommend!My sons fought over the white one. Like the kick stand. Good price - got it on sale!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new and improved graphics and how you have different ways of moving around, like how there is the silliness and minecart
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read.... Can't wait for book 3!!! This book was totally awesome. A good flow from book number into book number two. Hopefully the conclusion book three is equally good or even better!!!! I really can't wait!!!!
B007VPLNGW|4.0|It's a cute game....my 7 year old likes the more \\"fun\\" cartoon type games. This is one you can give your kids and worry about what they are playing.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I find that the BBC news is less hype and more information. It is nice to be able to access REAL news from anywhere.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A perfect dream of a book. The imagery of this book is the stuff which my dreams are made of.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great games amazing graphics. interesting storyline. Very entertaining &amp; thoughtful. I had a few glitches in the game. Puzzles wouldn't accept correct pieces.<br />)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing! I play it almost every day and can't wait for 0.7.0!!!!!! I find that it is very easy to learn to play and extremely easy to Love.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My friend got me hooked on this series.  Blood & gore is not my thing; however the story line is incredible. Watched all three seasons within a month - yes there were lots of 2 a.m. nights...got to get to bed....I have to work in the a.m......oh just one more episode type of nights.  Can't wait until season IV starts in the fall.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Martin breaks all the rules of storytelling with his first novel in the series. I found myself drawn into a whole world of intrigue with compelling, authentic characters, each burdened by their individual moral codes and motivated by their own backstorys, seeping through into every action as the story unfolds. The world in this first book is already complex, but Martin offers up a sketch, reigning in his desire to paint everything with overwhelming shades and hues.<br />Unfortunately, I can't say the same for his sequels.
0446580848|1.0|Such a waste of paper.  How can this be so bad after the very entertaining Lion's Game.  Retire John Carey and move on.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|One the one hand, I appreciate that the world becomes more and more complex, that more characters are given backstories and are rounded out (particularly, I enjoyed learning more about Cersei). However, it's honestly all a bit much. I can barely keep up with the Brotherhood without Banners, and I keep forgetting about what Dani's up to.<br /><br />I admire Martin's ambition, but the problem is, if you keep killing off main characters, you can't expect us to continue investing in new ones. Martin is a fantastic storyteller and character-creator, but it honestly got to the point where the only chapters I read thoroughly were Arya's.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Good series to buy. This was great late at night. Please watch and enjoy. I love vic. He's so smooth and sexy.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|George R.R. Martin spent four pages describing a single meal.<br /><br />I think that's all I need to say about this tome.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|This show is the great!  Enjoy the low tech future compared to the modern Star Trek.  Watched a few shows and the characters will grow on you.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed it. Kept me busy for a while. I liked the graphics very cool. A few times I thought something was going to jump out at me. I wouldn't mind another one like this but maybe with different levels, like beginner and intermediate to advanced!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Loved this movie.....kinda sad ending, and it is based on a true story...if you are an adventurous type..you will love this movie...
0345525558|5.0|What a great book!  The last book that impacted me this much was The Help.  Everyone should read this book.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Script wasn't well defined. Lots of action without substance. Renner does a good job, just doesn't have much to work with.
B003097ABA|5.0|I forgot how many great songs the Cars have. This is a great deal for all these classic albums. I highly recommend.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|I love art history, and Frida's story is one that deserved being told.  Salma Hayek is amazing.  I was riveted to this film, unable to do anything but just watch; soaking up the sometimes tragic, but artful life story of this woman.  Worth watching again and again!
B005MWK9JS|5.0|Hate that the whole movie revolves around the girl- a ugly girl!- as the love interest. It takes away from the robots and the initial mission. Sad the Shia is leaving the series, he really did a great job. I wish the next person taking over would have more guts and be more built for the action sequences!
B001TOD92C|4.0|The only reason that this review is 4 stars, rather than 5 is for one reason...  This is the LOUDEST spinning DVD I have possibly EVER played.  We had to crank up the volume just to drown out the sound of the disc.  Originally we thought it might have been the PS3, but it did the exact same thing in the XBOX 360.  Weird!  But anyways, if you've never seen it. you must.  Mickey Rourke is phenomenal and greatly deserved that award he won.
B0017YZII2|2.0|I like that she plays the piano. but she tries too hard with her voice. maybe staying in the alto voice range would be great, then she could fill the void Norah Jones left when she lost her mind!
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|I was the only one in the family who had never seen this film, prior to purchasing it.  For the soundtrack alone, this film gets 5 stars from me.  But the story...  Forrest's story gets even more.  From growing up different, to fighting in Vietnam, to playing ping-pong and never straying from his one love...  This is a film that can't help but deserve to be watched.  I laughed and I cried.  Beautiful, and Tom Hanks, you're the man.  Thank you for bringing Forrest to life.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Good movie about the cost of war in today's world. Wish there was more action rather than just at the end. Is there going to be a sequel? It was kinda just they all lived happily ever after and rushed at the end
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|i have loved everthing this writer has ever written.  Always sorry when the book ends.  My heart goes out to the characters because I believe he rpresents them based on facts.
B008M721MS|5.0|I could not believe that I could get Skype on my Kindle!!!  Thank you Kindle for letting me get it.  I can sit in my lounge chair and Skype my family and friends from all over the world.
B001F12J48|1.0|One of the worst 3d movies I've seen.....should have known by the price....it messed up my eyes....oh well ...will look for better quality movies.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|Honestly this book is on another level, Anthony Ryan brings it to a whole new scale. Nothing but respect!<br />Conor
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This has always been a good PDF reader. Something required when using small service manuals for some of my tools.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's a great book i think most would enjoy but there are some parts u might find totally stupid but read it i think u will like it
B004UIOUHC|1.0|It didn't install on my Kindle Fire, while I'd like to give it a good review, sadly I'm not able to even use it.<br />According to another reviewer, I must learn how to &#34;side-load&#34; apps.<br /><br />The Opera browser for the desktop, is a very good, stable browser. I'd like to use it on my Kindle.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I was 14 when I first read this book. Now, 60 years later it is like meeting an old friend. There are still some paragraphs I can almost quote from memory. A timeless story. We
B006UKFFE0|1.0|After I downloaded the kindle version of the book I was very irritated to find that a couple of sentences on every page have missing endings. Please fix this.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|But it's pretty slow at times.  The actual tsunami was done really well. The little boy that was with the mom was good.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As an IT professional struggling for the right way to start broaching the subject of taking virtualization and automation beyond where they are today, this book has given me a new way to think about communicating the need for DevOps. If you're an IT pro that's looking for the next evolution to take services, this is a good way to start the thoughts flowing, and help frame the discussion you need to have with your peers, bosses and customers.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great tool. Very handy to have around for laundry, cooking, etc.  Love the customization options, particularly speaking the alarm name.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This show is very well done!  Acting, scenery, and plot engage the viewer with a totally enjoyable and memorable viewing experience.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Got about half way in, and it got too dark for me. Too bad, I was enjoying it, and looking forward to the ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire. Easy to use and all the features I use most. Well done.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I'll preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of the way Quinten makes movies. I love his tension filled dialog sequences that carry on for 25 minutes. I love his over the top use of garden hose administered blood splatters when people get shot, being both horrific and disarming at once. Heck, I even love his non-period music he throws in there that seems to work only because he is who he is.<br />I enjoyed it, DiCaprio is awesome, Waltz is mesmerizing and charming and Foxx is great.<br />I thought Basterds was better, but hey, that's me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have not been this excited about a series ever!<br />The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery, Homes are unbelievable and close to history I look up  some things that catch my fancy to see if it matches history and i am amazed how accurate things are so close to history. Waiting for the 4th series impatiently
B005JABSB6|5.0|Glasses have only been used for two movies but so far no complaints. Only time will tell.<br />They feel great and can wear for entire movie with no discomfort
B004QBWU02|5.0|This movie brings back some special memories and is good for a million laughs.  Reall fun to see some great actors in their early years.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|I absolutely love this series so I am totally shocked that this DVD is NOT true to the Season 3 that was shown on the U.S. public television stations.  There are MISSING scenes in this \\"original U.K. version\\" (as it is advertised).  I watched this season on my local PBS station back in January 2013 and recently viewed it on Comcast On-Demand and noticed missing scenes.  Examples:  the scene when Daisy goes to visit Mr. Mason and he tells her that he wants to have her come live with him so that he can teach her how to run a farm - the end of that scene is missing on this DVD; another example:  the breakfast scene when Tom discusses that his daughter will be named Sybil and that she will be christened a Catholic - the beginning of that scene is missing.  Had I noticed this earlier, I would have returned this DVD for a refund and would have waited to purchase it when I could be assured that it was a true unedited version. If you are a serious Downton Abbey fan, do not purchase this DVD set.
1936594234|5.0|A book everyone should have, read , and apply the concept to their life, the only way to believe is by proving to yourself if really work,,,,All I could say it works.. it really, really works...ask and you shall receive,  you learn how to ask..and then you  receive,,,My test was I wanted a nice car, but i couldn't get a BMW out of mind and that's what I got four weeks after I've been practicing, A 2006 BMW 745 i black just like the one in my vivid visualization..I did not see the year but the car..<br />my next test  $100k a year..the bible say&#62; everything is possible for those who believe..Mark 9:23
1857885082|5.0|Ts book came upon recommendation from an expat that came home to visit.  I told her I was moving to Englan and she recommended this book.  It is on the mark!  Get it if you want to understand english sayings....lol!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Nothing was lost in translation.  For one who doesn't know the story this was clearer than the stage.  Great Acting and most importantly-great singing
B008Q07U5O|4.0|Great movie!  Second time that this was viewed.  Jack Nicholson is a superb actor. Something that stands out..in most films when the star character is hurt the next scene rarely shows the injury. This character's nostril is cut by some thugs. Bandages, bleeding, and healing process as movie progressed made the movie and character believable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you haven't read this where have you been.  If you've only watched the movie you're missing out, it's just really, really good.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|Fabulous documentary. Just fabulous. LOVED it! Entertaining with an insiders look. This should be watched by every musician and every fan of a band.
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I am finding this app hard to use. It is not very user friendly. I took it off my Kindle right away.<br /><br />Kim<br />Nevada
B007REV4YI|2.0|Worst James Bond movie ever.  Where are Sean Connery or Pearce Brosnan when you need them?  Any one would be better...
B001OQCV6A|5.0|We Loved this movie. My husband and I enjoyed it so very much.  Funny, sarcastic, and just plain good entertainment.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addictive.  I played this on Facebook now I play it on my Kindle.  I recommend this to anyone who likes match three
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really really good book and a great ending to the series.  Lets face it if you've read the rest you're going to read this so i don't need to say much.  It's a good book and you won't be disappointed.
1476734941|3.0|I have sort of started this one but I will be seriously doing this at some time in the future..after some other things in my life settle down first.
B0085FF55W|5.0|A refreshing listen.  We mainly purchased this CD for one song (), but wound up listening to every song when it plays.  It's been in the 5 disc carousel, without a break, for three weeks now.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Enjoy this series but after so many episodes, it starts feeling there is a formula and the episodes start feeling similar.
B000P0J09W|5.0|One of my top 20 movies of all times!  Really, the truffell shuffle, Hey You Guys!  Chunk!  What a cast.  Keeps you laughing and entertained the whole time.  If you have not seen it.....Watch it.  Loads of fun.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Oh yeah.  I am very addicted to this one.  I like the explosions. Wish I could beat my highest score.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just another great book in a great series.  Very easy read that i couldn't put down.  It really just keeps getting better as the characters develop more and more.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|a cute game.  you jump around on your floating ice and try not to be eliminated and eaten by the sharks.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game you can make your own city and buy things that a real city would like dump trucks and shopping malls etc. Really fun
B008JGSM6G|4.0|More fun and lots more challenging than it appears. This is visually<br /> simple - no flashing lights to tire your eyes and give you a headache or worse! And there are NO annoying sounds either. For those who are sick of violent<br />PlayStation games. Etc, let the kids play this . Imo this game may improve logical thinking and the process for finding creative solutions when things don't work the way you'd expected. I'll look for more games like this one.
1936608898|5.0|This book will up-end everything you think you know about food.  And they're right.  Read it.  Prepare to have your life changed forever.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Wonderful game.  Makes u think sometimes.  Repeats itself sometimes.  Don't care much for the different l as languages.  I recommend it
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Found it hard to put down. Loved the way the plot thickened. A very different read. I would recommend it.
B003L77GRO|5.0|The dexter series is great from start to finish. It leaves you on the edge of your seat in each season. Must watch
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I was planning on getting all four of these books. I'm glad I just got the first.  I'm over it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|If sex and full frontal nudity bother you, don't watch it.  But if you like a great story, great acting and a great production, then watch it.  It is a serious move about a serious subject.
B00CK4VS6Y|5.0|This show has everything you could want, romance, intrigue, sass and science. Love it and anything that the BBC puts out is almost always great.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Although the music was a little before my time, I had to have it after attending &#34;Jersey Boys.&#34;  My 80 year old aunt dances around her kitchen to her copy each morning!  Fun for all.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So... this app is really cool and has great graphics. It also is gray for passing time and is very addictive. But the makers never update it and it is really hard to make money.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Loved this book.  Recommend it to all my friends, starting with my daughter.  Tina Fey is funny, real, down- to- earth, funny, nutty, funny, talented! Also funny!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I didnt thought this book book could be that book, but it realy caught me for the very beggining. totally recommended for everyone. Read the hole series and fall in love the way I did and if you dont like you can tell me hahaha
B0040X46TE|5.0|Love listening it over and over, at home and in my vehicle.  Such a wonderful and gifted young man, cut short in his prime.  Beautiful melodies!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I am a fan of Justin and this cd did not disappoint.  Although only 10 songs, each song unique and well crafted.
0060853980|5.0|If I was on a deserted island and I could only have one book, this would be that book. I have read it at least 10 times and every time I have enjoyed it as much as the first time. Maybe even more.<br />Beyond being my favorite book. This is a necessary book.<br /><br />An Angel and a Demon learn that the world is ending, judgement is coming, and their time on their beloved earth is coming to an end. They work together to save it, and of course screw up. The anti-christ ends up in the wrong place and is raised by \\"normal\\" humans, instead of his demonic parents as intended. The effect this has on everything is hilarious and awe inspiring. All through this there is a young witch trying to figure out the meanings of her ancestors predictions so that she can fulfill her parts of them. She is very prepared.<br />An absolutely hilarious romp through the book of Revelations, Judgement and God and his Ineffable Plan. HIGHLY irreverent and possibly even offensive to many people of faith. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is easily offended on religious grounds. No, wait a minute, yes I would.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an app I can not live with out. This app allows me and my family prepare ahead of time and be ready for any condition outside.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just can not stop playing it the higher the level you get to the more you wanna play it the more prizes you get the better it keeps getting
B00278U1W0|5.0|I read some of the reviews about the bad audio and this is not what I received.  Audio and video are fantastic.  This is one of the best concert video's I have ever seen.  If you have any appreciation for musician-al talent in singers, songwriters, and players you will appreciate this DVD.  It is like seeing Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, Traffic, and Eric Clapton in one show.  They do not make them like this anymore people!  This is a dying breed and talent base.  The raw talent, maturity, and years of experience show in every song on this DVD.  You would be crazy not to have this as one in your collection.  I am in awe.  This is not your 3 chord blues video and suggested for only those who have an appreciation for the artistry of Claption and Winwood.  Lots of brain cells killed for them to get to this level, no doubt.  Not for the weak in heart, thumpa thumpa, discoteque, electronica, computer generated fans and whatever they call that stuff.  These boys rock! Those of you in this category will know what I mean.  This is an essential to any collection to aficionados' if you consider yourself one.
0440237688|4.0|I've read that writers should start a story \\"in the middle of the action\\" to hook readers and keep them flipping pages. Lowry did precisely this, and I was hooked all the way to the end which didn't feel like much of an ending. The problem was, she also \\"ended in the middle of the action\\" leaving it feeling incomplete. Open-ended stories kinda tick me off, which is why I give this a 4 instead of a 5. Considered giving it a 3, but that wouldn't have been fair to the beginning and middle of the story that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />The book is gripping, motivations solid and characters well developed. Obviously written for someone younger than myself (I'm a 49-year-old woman), but still compelling enough to keep me thinking about it even when I wasn't actively flipping pages.<br /><br />This is how all books should be written. Except with endings.
B0094MFITS|5.0|The author of the Jesse Stone books said that Tom Selleck nailed the Jesse Stone character and Selleck was the best actor to have ever portrayed one of his main characters.  Great movies, with good scripts and excellent supporting actors.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|My husband keeps saying, &#34;are you done with that yet?&#34;<br />It's just a great CD.<br />Track 1 is my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really loved this game it is so much fun and I don't have a real horse this game makes me feel like I do!!!!!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|You couldn't help but feel for the main character and I found myself reading almost straight through to the end. I really like it. This is a perfect time of year for this book with the flowers blooming and wanting to get out in the garden.  You will have a new found respect for what you plant and or the fresh cut flowers that you buy at the market!
B004XQO90O|4.0|\\"An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge\\" was a short story by the famous Ambrose Bierce. In the story, a southern spy in the civil war is to be hanged. The story was featured as an episode on the Twilight Zone if you were around to catch it in 1964. The spy escapes his fate and narrowly escapes numerous times. Unbelievably escapes - and you know what they say about too good to believe. This movie is well written and well acted. Everything in it was almost a mirror image of the Owl Creek story. The soldier can't miraculously escape his fate time after time. Instead he keeps losing his life in a horrific explosion -- or does he. Conjuring up memories of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone is my compliment! Well done.
B00683JLXA|3.0|This game is almost identical to Angry Birds, and not as good. The free version of Angry Birds is a better value. I do like the graphics, the panda is cute.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I'm years behind and just started watching the series on prime. Beautiful costumes, a bit sexed up, but beautiful. I like it so far.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|I understand that this is a biographical film and that they were held to the actual events.  I feel like it could have been done differently so that it was no so slow moving.  It was okay but not sure I would reccomend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!<br />Story line just kept dragging me in.<br />Would definitely recommend!<br />Looking forward to seeing the movie!<br />Romantic and suspenseful... loved the ending!
B005LJKEXS|3.0|The 32 foot length is great, but if I move my computer or touch the cable while I'm connected to the internet then I lose the connection. I don't know if it's because the end of the cable doesn't mate well to the computer or if the 32 ft length is a bit too much for a USB cable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|No glitches it's awesomeness. Play it/download it....... it awesome awesome. Beastly horses. Sexy horses. I got a brown one. Get this app. Now do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Did u do it?
B0068THAGY|5.0|Another great Spielberg movie.  It was a cross between Stand By Me & Close Encounters which were both great movies.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|love I get to see it from the start and see ones I missed woohoo ty 4 that love the show
B009GX7IRA|4.0|This was a gift, but since it still resides in the house I have had many opportunities to watch the DVD's.  This is a riveting show and we all have enjoyed watching the episodes on DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I needed.  Simple and intuitive.  Really like the big buttons.  Has all the features necessary for most tasks.
030758836X|3.0|I was a little disappointed. The start was a little slow, and the ending, I felt was predictable.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but not as great as everyone told me it was.
0789318245|4.0|The item is exactly as described, a very fun flash tattoo reference with a little background.  I would have like to see a little more world variety, but an overall win.  Really liked the book, if your in to old school tattoos or looking for some ideas for vintage flash I recommend it.  If you are looking for a book that describes the history of vintage tattoos this is not the book for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love dystopian future fiction and read as much as I can get my hands on. This series was incredibly original and the characters are very well developed. I'd definitely recommend this series
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Bought it 3 months ago and so far had no problems with it, good quality material.<br />The sound is very clear, has nice balance between highs and lows.<br />It doesn't isolates external sounds as much as I wanted to, but for using it at home and at work (listening to music and watching movies) is a good product. I bought it because I have two musician friends who use it at their home studios, I tried it at their studios and love it, thats why I bought it.<br />So far, no complains. However, I must say I'm not an expert, neither a musician, or DJ, or whatever. On the other hand, sound is great and materials used are good.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The first 30 minutes are very good, the rest is predictable an boring.  The acting is good but the script goes over the top.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|If you are a Top Gun fan, it is a must!! Really nice 3D effects, you will feel like inside the motion.
0385341008|5.0|This book was an unexpected pleasure. I read it because I was on vacation and it was in my friend's bookshelf. I was sucked in right away. It was a very moving book.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Snark Busters has beautiful graphics, good puzzles, and time flies when you're hunting for a snark! You will never want it to end.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a fun game that helps me pass the time away.  If you want a little fun in your day, buy it!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Well written, intriguing, amazing and diverse characters!  Hope there will be a Part II.  Not my usual genre.  Will be reading other books by this author...
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This was an excellent movie and it was so easy to order it from Amazon's Instant Video rental.  Thanks, Amazon. The acting was outstanding and shows the power of love.

B00BESFWBY|4.0|If you like surfing and the majesty of the ocean this is a must see movie.  The visuals outweigh the schmaltz.
B000QY9WOU|4.0|We actually saw Cher's &#34;Farewell Tour&#34; in Tucson over ten years ago and she put on a fantastic show! This video is basically the same show but with better seats. VERY entertaining. The reason for four stars is that a better recording could have been done - definitely not HD. But entertaining never-the-less.

B0094M2SCI|5.0|The underworld series in one of the best movies series I have had the pleasure to watch thank you producers
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|An interesting look at the poltics of the time and how similar the macinations are yesterday and today.  An irresponsible Congress pandering to ideas that should have been discarded thirty years before and an administration fearful of taking direct action.  Although FDR takes the risk of carrying out impeachable acts for what he believes is the correct path for the country
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Season one was the perfect blend of drama and humor.  By the time you watch season 3, there seems to be only struggle and sorrow.  I miss that balance of humor.  Even Granny isn't humorous anymore.  It's still one of the best TV series I've seen in years though.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This is fun reading, but there is nothing really exciting about this book. It isn't The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|If you like match 3 games, you can't go wrong with this one. It's tough without being impossible and you'll need some of the bonuses you get to get through some levels.<br />.<br />It's also pretty to look at, as the graphics are above par. Definitely a five star game for people who like this kind of play.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|After reading the masterpiece that is \\"The Fault of our Stars\\" I thought I'd give John Green's earlier work a try. I was disappointed. This book lacks the craftsmanship I expected and the ending was completely predictable. I wish he had developed the plot a little bit more.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I love how Kate Morton is able to see the perspective of a person's life through the eyes of an elderly person.  To know they were young once and had the feelings and emotions of the young and that you carry that through for the rest of your life.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Arguably no institution has greater power to shape and mold public opinion than mass media organizations like Disney.  They claim to simply respond to public tastes, but they usually twist and turn those tastes to suit their own objectives.  Their influence is hard to see, since they start early, shaping our minds when we are yet youngsters.  Pixar's Brave is a case in point.<br /><br />Promoted as a hip, feminist fairy tale, Brave tells the story of Merida, a Scottish princess required to marry a prince from a rival clan in order to quell the potential for war.  Merida sports the most violently blow-dried mop of red hair since Nicole Kidman's Aussie youth.  The princes vying for Merida's hand - like all male characters in the film - are portrayed as oafish losers.  Merida seems justified when claiming the right as a first-born noble to \\"champion herself.\\"  In Zena-like fashion, she is quite the waifish warrior, capable of outmatching the males at all martial arts.<br /><br />Most of the film deals with Merida's conflict with her mother; she defies the Queen's wishes to submit to an arranged marriage.  A magical spell causes Merida's mother to transform into a beast.  The girl must reconcile with her mother before the change becomes permanent.<br /><br />The subtext of the story involves how females suffer from the burdens of obligations they bear due to men.  Like many popular entertainments, Brave characterizes females as almost a separate species from males, possessing insight and sensitivity that the barely-sentient masculine sex lacks.  The last time we saw a wave of similarly-themed entertainment was during the feminist revolution of the early Seventies.  In both cases, the true conflict was not between the sexes but between employers and workers.  In the 2000's the public is saturated with stories about female empowerment, but really it is a justification for an employer's power to hire cheaper female workers, firing men en masse.  Brave is an attempt to reconcile children to this social norm, even before they develop the power to decide for themselves what those norms should be.  In the end, Brave is a sinister agent for a brave new world.ncile children to this social norm, even before they develop the power to decide for themselves what those norms should be.  In the end, Brave is a sinister agent for a brave new world.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I enjoyed the move. I have all three movies. Enjoyed each one, but then I'm a sci-fi fan to begin with.
B0031RSBU0|5.0|And Henning Mankell is one of the best, right up there with Steig Larrson! As with all his Wallander novels,<br />&#34;The Dogs of Riga&#34; hold the reader's avid attention until the very last unforeseen minute. The cold of the exquisitely beautiful and sometimes alienating Swedish country is extenuated by the darkness of the plot and characters, adding to the suspense and sense of evil being planned and executed. Mankell's delightful and well executed prose introduces you to the characters who, by the conclusion of each book, have become people you know intimately. You will empathise with Wallander himself, lonely, endearing, desperately hoping for love and acceptance, his cantankerous secretary, his daughter and co-police officer and his beloved shaggy dog. If you have seen the BBC television series &#34;Wallander&#34; staring Kenneth Branagh, you really need to read the novels which inspired it. I commend this, and all of Mankell's novels, to those of you who like to become so enthralled with a novel that you can't bear to put it down for any reason!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on my toes. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Lots of surprises. Wow!
B002DS3982|5.0|Well all know tray Denzel is an amazing actor. This movie is just another example of his greatness. Very emotional and touching movie.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|I believe Kate Morton is one of the best writers of our time.  She can go to the past, the present and the future and twist and twine the story over a great expanse of time.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Good racing game.  Better on a my galaxy tablet than on my droid phone, but playable on both my 10 yr old son also loves it.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Subtle deviation/modification from the original presentation makes it a pleasant album without irritation.  I like the 1st, 8th, 10th, and 12th tracks, they tend to have a very story-telling quality.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I finished reading the book and highly recommend it. The parts that were hard to read were about Jamie's early life. Especially knowing that what he experienced in the orphanage was not unusual for those days. However, the conversations he had as an adult with his neighbor Rose and the local bar keep were delightful. Lydia's struggle with her mother was well described. Finally, I really enjoyed the Irish setting and the dialect.
1426209584|5.0|The dvd didn't really show much of what they photographed so found that it was really good for them to add in a book to show all of the species this has to offer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book. I think Amazon needed to make the purchaser aware that the book is on the verge of pornography, and the story line was also demeaning to women.  I deleted it after the first 3 chapters (unfortunately the sample didn't reveal the true nature of the book.) Wish I could get a refund. It was trash and a waste of money.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie is fantastic, both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were superb! Also, as someone with a family member with a mental illness, I thought they did a phenomenal job displaying what is it like both for the person with the mental illness and the family and friends while making it a really heartwarming and funny movie.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|My son who loves them motorcycles bought this.<br />Yes he loves it and has watched it many times.<br />So thanks from Brandon is in order.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I am not a child but, I have watched many of Disney movies with my grandchildren over the years and when I saw Brave come to the theaters I wanted to see it but, no one to go with. When I saw I could rent it from Amazon I just had to see it. I loved it, it was so, good.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The story was interesting, The plot kept me interested and while the outcome was expected the movie was done well and kept the suspense going.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|This is the only soundtrack to anything ive ever considered buying, and im extreemly satisfied with my purchase. The only problem i have with the songs are that their only about one to two minutes long, but they're all amazing.

B0058W74UY|2.0|I don't know why they didn't put adobe flash on the kindle fire HD. At least if they did they should have made it a little bit easier to activate and deactivate. I wanted to do pixie hollow on my KF HD and the said that I needed flash but I CAN'T GET FLASH!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY should at least put it on and so we can do whatever it is that we want to do. Also, it is a computer sort of but there are some websites that say you need flash player but you can't go on them anymore because of FLASH PLAYER.<br /><br />I AM VERY MAD AND UPSET 0 STARS (if that is even a thing) DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|excellent movie. I am looking forward to the second or even third movie. loved the characters, 3d quality was awesome
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good game with great animation. Puzzles are not difficult in the beginning and it draws you in.  I like this one.
B004U8VX2M|2.0|BORING! Unrealistic, bad sound quality, stilted acting.  I normally really like this genre, but this one's just awful.  I tried and tried to get into it, but couldn't.
B00BAYLRNO|3.0|First, I want to say that this is a great movie with great acting.  I wish I could give it 5 stars but I was so disappointed in this lackluster release.  For a film that has such incredible special effects, where big Hollywood stars (and young kids) appear to be in the midst of an actual tsunami, I was expecting a great \\"Making Of...\\" feature with lots of details on how certain scenes and shots were done.  Nope.  The two \\"Making Of...\\" extras are really only  featurettes, both \\"Extras\\" come to less then 12 minutes COMBINED.  Not a lot of info for such a great film with jaw-dropping SFX.  Also, I was looking for a combo pack with a Blu Ray, DVD and Digital Copy all in one box.  Nope.  You can get the DVD with a Digital Copy or a Blu Ray with a Digital Copy, no combo pack.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked this book because it wasn't like I did this I did that but it was true to life in a war zone. I served with the 173 Airborne in Vietnam and even thought that was a different time and place war is war and you take the good with the bad and you carry on. This book brought out the truth of war in all aspects, good and bad.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I wanted a Dream Theatre CD because I had stumbled on their music while surfing Youtube. The cd only has 7 song son it, but each song is very long (think Led Zepplin's length of songs) so it's worth it. Lots of guitar licks in it and really good sound to it. Highly recommended.

0783235666|3.0|good movie but I ordered the wrong one--it needed to be DVD not the VHS I got.  Just wasted money<br />Acting style s are very different even though the remastering is good.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The author, not yet 40 (amazingly) when he wrote the book, has been quoted as saying:<br /><br />\\"Suddenly, my mind was exploding with ideas. I could hardly keep up with them. In jubilant minutes whole portions of the novel emerged fully formed: the lifeboat, the animals, the intermingling of the religious and the zoological, the parallel stories.  Where did that moment of inspiration come from? Why did I think that religion and zoology would make a good mix? ...I could give approximate answers. That India, where there are so many animals and religions, lent itself to such a story. That tensions simmering just below my level of consciousness were probably feverishly pushing me to come up with a story. But in truth I don't know. It just happened.\\"<br /><br />\\"It just happened....\\" the rendering of raw life into something far more profound, something universal, a tale known by heart by an unfortunate number of souls who have experienced a \\"shipwreck\\"; and, a morality tale, one that can transcend the obvious carnal horror and touch upon that which is beyond our experience, that in which our experience has its being, and its purpose.<br /><br />What is a shipwreck? One is journeying toward something, with hope, and the vicissitudes of life foul the journey.  When the \\"ship\\" goes down, everything is lost.  One is left in a hostile world surrounded by the unknown and the horizon disappears twice a day, dawn and dusk, into itself.  There are no markers, there are no maps.<br /><br />A tragedy for which there are no words, a loss so deep that it rivals the power of nature, an ocean of loss.  I know this by heart. I, too, now live with a very large and very dangerous animal.  This is a fight for survival, it is no game, it is no fairy tale.  I feed the beast as best I can and try to avoid it.  Ultimately, I must learn about it and it must - in some way - co-exist with me.  Together, uncomfortable companions, we seek safe harbor.  Safe harbor is far from safe, it is self-consuming.  The only safety is in not looking for it; the only path is back into the journey, the beast and I, toward life.  Can we find it, can we survive? I will not be consumed by the beast, but neither can I consume it.  We are together now, whatever the future.<br /><br />Shall I tell my story in its brutal reality, tearing into the consciousness and sensitivities of those who hear it?  I learn that this is not a prudent choice.  And so I tell it in this way, as I have said, the beast and I.  Everyone fears the beast, do they not?  Yet, not everyone travels with one, and so the story can be safely told.<br /><br />There is magic and even beauty in even the worst horror.  Nothing is without purpose; this is part of the lesson.<br /><br />You cannot tame the beast.  There must be a partnership, a reluctant partnership.  You may find comfort in the oddest of places and when least expected but, ultimately, you must continue the journey.  Or die trying.<br /><br />\\"Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching.  Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching.  And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, and gave me a sign to continue my journey.\\"<br /><br />Evil and horror are real, but they are encapsulated, they are quarantined from the essential element of soul.  The beast can enter our lives; we can succumb to the horror and be eaten alive, by our own lack of hope and loss of faith.  Or we can arrive at a place where we, and our beast, co-exist.  I am not yet at the place where my beast leaves me.  Perhaps I never will be.  There is something in us that wants to hold onto the beast.  And we are left with two stories: the horror or the hope.<br /><br />\\"Can I ask you something?\\"<br />\\"Of course.\\"<br />\\"I've told you two stories  about what happened out on the ocean.  Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.  In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I survive.\\"<br />\\"True.\\"<br />\\"So which story do you prefer?\\"<br />\\"The one with the tiger, that's the better story.\\"<br />\\"Thank you.  And so it goes with God.\\"<br /><br />Go in peace.ies, and I survive.\\"<br />\\"True.\\"<br />\\"So which story do you prefer?\\"<br />\\"The one with the tiger, that's the better story.\\"<br />\\"Thank you.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love all three seasons. Too bad there is not more out there. Season two captured the time, culture and events that affected the British upper class during the WWII. It was done phenomenally well.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Great game but at times it can be difficult and fuatrating. You need patient to play this game but it really is fun when you get it down and pact.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great app. Very enjoyable and interesting. Very easy to use and fun. I have told a few of my friends about it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I love it. This was one of he first releases of a true team member and I have to believe one of the most accurate without the government censorship and editing involved.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|Tom Cruise does an excellent job of playing Tom Cruise, but there is no evidence of Jack Reacher in this film with the except of one brief fight scene. The plot is silly, the acting is terrible, and if there were any direction, it didn't show. Don't waist you time or money on this clunker.
B002DW92SE|4.0|The thing that most impresses me about this book is it is not my usual science fiction or fantasy genre and yet i loved it. It could be a quiet book about relationships but it is much funnier than that.  Nick Hornby finds the humor in human reltionships and tells the story in a way that kept me  smiling and interested.  I look forward  to other books.
B007REV4YI|2.0|First, let me say this is an amazing film. I have no issues there. The low rating is for the bluray itself. I ordered the bluray, then sent it back for a new copy. Neither of the two bluray discs would play in my bluray player or laptop, both have all available software updates. I looked around online and am seeing a lot of people having this same issue with the skyfall bluray disc. So what's going on?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I rated this book a five star. It is a great book that i cannot put down and it is also a book that i can read over and over again!!!!

0307719774|5.0|I bought this for myself and answer the question each day.  I have not quite had it a year yet, but it will be really interesting once I can compare my answers from year to year.  I have purchased this for several friends and they love it as well.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the space to answer is small, but I think the answers are supposed to be short and sweet.  I do suggest that you look at some of questions ahead of time and maybe give yourself a day or two to think about it.  Sometimes I had know idea what to write down and looking ahead helped.  I definitely recommend this for yourself or as a gift.

B001DM1VXE|1.0|Husband stumbled onto this movie while looking for the life of Pi, and I have to say, I could only take 5 min of this.  Not worth the time it took to write this review.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Give 5+ stars. Play game daily and still enjoy every minute. Love being able to connect with friends, make new friends, and earn rewards daily.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the format and layout of this story.  I liked the way each chapter was from alternating perspectives.  The plot follows a couple in which the wife goes missing.  We (the reader) see the cracks in their marriage, as well as the deception by both parties.  There were a couple of areas where was a little surprised by the path the story followed, but it all came together well.  I definately would recommend it, and will be reading more of Flynn's books.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Game is really good fun to play for hours just would like more games to play hope that happens soon
B009X01C64|5.0|fits perfect, easy to use, seems to be very durable and I really like the way the stand works in both directions thanks to the swivel feature.

0374275637|4.0|Very interesting book even for people who are not involved with psicology, but who are interested in the subject.<br /><br />It presents a huge number of empiric experiments whose results are explaneid in a very simple language, even if it is written by one of the greatest (if not the greatest) specialists in the world regarding the theme.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very unique and so much fun...I really wish there were more games like this out there.  Can't wait for the next one!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie was enjoyable and I do not regret spending time to watch it. I have not read the books yet but I do plan to do so. The movie spurred some interest in the books for me.
B00BESCJII|5.0|Fantastic story about the kid at school who's not in the cool crowd!  Depicts real life issues facing teens and relates well to parents and teenagers!
B004LQI0HE|5.0|This was a terse, emotional, and tension-filled roller-coaster of a film. Like any good science fiction, it attempts to answer the question &#34;What does it mean to be human?&#34; And like all great S-F, the action happens within the dialogue more than via special effects. Overall, Never Let Me Go is a beautiful, touching, wrenching film; be sure you see it before you &#34;complete.&#34;
B003O86FMW|4.0|Action packed.  Read this book before seeing the movie.  The book puts more insights into what and why.  The book kept me turning pages and not wanting to stop.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a book that lets you into the life of a boy who is going to school for the first time in 5th grade. This is a boy who looks different than any child though. You hear the story from several points of view and fall in love with Auggie, Jack, and the Pullman family. Themes of friendship and overcoming challenges are threaded throughout this book. I laughed and I cried. I couldn't put it down!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Liked everything!  Story line was well written and casted perfectly.  Hope their are many many seasons.  Cannot wait for new episodes.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed the relationships in this book as we watch the protagonist learn to love.  The language of flowers adds another level of interest and charm to this story.

B005UKJX4E|4.0|Tree of Life tells you in its title what to expect.It calls to mind one of those nature documentaries by Attenborough,as 20 minutes in we go back to the formation of the Earth,the fires of the sun,1st stirrings of life in cells in the sea,roaring waters,jelly fish.There are images in spate,whole Niagaras of them.In the rest of the film there are moments captured as if for the 1st time,a butterfly alighting upon Mrs O' Brien's hand,the glint of sunlight on the river or through trees,a touch,exultant running,a satin chemise.This is a memoir of his own childhood from the child's eye-view.Malik makes a mythology from Paradise,the Fall of Man and the Book of Job.Its main subject is a family of mother,father and 3 sons, life in suburban Waco,Texas.He assigns archetypal roles to mother(grace) and father(selfish,striving Nature).<br /><br />The children's worship of their peacful,nurturing,pre-Raphaelite-like mother takes the form of an image of her floating,with a magical realism of light,dress,hair and balletic movement.We may be looking for a plot-line to hang the images on,what we receive is a great film-maker's search for material by capturing certain emotions and feelings of an America at the peak of its power through tracking shots through wind-waving grass,Vermeerish light through windows,whispered quasi-poetic narration,tree-canopies splintering the, sun,magic hour duskiness,beautifully shot by Lubezki.<br /><br />Malik stays close to the boys(particular Hunter McCracken as discontented Jack and Laramie Eppler as doomed, favourite middle son R.L.).Jack's rebellion from his embittered(Pitt's)dad,a disappointed musician working for an oil company,whose severe strictness with everybody and hot temper drives a wedge through the household.We are drawn into a vortex of half-whispered,prayer-like questioning, coming from the adult Jack(Penn)in the present and and from the mother and father in the past.What worries me is the avoidance of drama(cf Bergman and Allen's versions)due to the evident talent of Malik celebrating what's precious about life,his place as the father of modern American film,re-enacting the fall of mankind from a Garden of Eden,situated in 50s suburban America.<br /><br />He displays a gracious cinema of longing and regret.The end is grandiose,uniting all his present and past selves, dead and living loved ones,on a vast beach under a liturgical chorus,and considering the mystery of his own birth by returning to the primordial ooze.This feels clunkily over-symbolic.What remains like an implanted memory is the 1950s material making up the bulk of the running time staged with enthralling tactile and atmospheric detail. Chastain and Pitt are brilliant,the boys acting is superb.Malik's filming is like a chant of Homer's bard.This enhanced tone and elevation of subject-matter has a kind of unity and heroism.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|My daughter turned me on to Beth Hart and I have to thank her immensely! Beth Hart has such a bluesy/soulful voice I could listen to her for hours and with Joe Bonamassa on guitar, well, I'm just in heaven listening to this cd.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Who'd have thought a new James Bond film could be good,hit all the buttons in term of story,villain,M, topicality,setting,even be able to look down on the Bourne franchise as a young pretender,that's lost its hero. Directed superbly by Sam Mendes,set chiefly in England( in the year of the Olympics and Daniel Craig's Bond dropping in to Buckingham Palace to pick up the Queen and parachute her in to stadium).In place of the Queen we have Judy Dench's M,treating her agents mean,keeping them keen,Bond's adoptive mother.Javier Bardem plays Raul Silva,the best Bond villain in ages,with the camp of a Hannibal Lecter crossed with Julian Assange,the blonde hair flopping,an agent turned rogue,involved in cyber-terrorism.Bond is shot by fellow agent Moneypenny(Harris),while trying to retrieve a stolen hard-drive containing the identities of Nato agents.<br /><br />He returns from the dead ruggedly shaken(he fails the physical) to guard the woman who caused him to be shot.M herself is under scrutiny under pressure to resign from Mallory(Fiennes)after MI6 is bombed.M's antagonist Silva acts on matricidal emotions that Bond himself represses.This realism grounds the film,often mired in absurdity and fantasy, and the intelligence is upgraded.M quotes Tennyson's Ulysses.Bond meets geeky Q(Wishaw) in the National Gallery in front of Turner's The Fighting Temeraire,to draw a parallel between the scrapyard-bound warship and Bond's obsolescence.Casino Royale set the template of the new Craig Bond and would be hard to better,based as it was on the best Fleming novel.This is a great follow up on Bond's 50th anniversary.<br /><br />There is an homoerotic scene between Bond and Silva which is highly comic.The Oedipal relationship with M is a new twist.M has an emotional power over her 00-agents,which accounts for the potency of the villain.Both have an emotional backstory with M.Is Dench the best Bond girl ever?The pre-credit sequence is a spectacular chase scene in Istanbul.Roger Deakins'cinematography has improved since the choppy Quantum of Solace with great action set pieces.The last part of the story is set in the Scottish Highlands and produces that brilliant character actor Albert Finney as Kincade,Bond's old gamekeeper.Bond takes M to his childhood home,booby-traps the house and takes on Silva's men when they arrive.There is a hint of sentimentality but charged with atmosphere and energy.One of the best Bonds with spectacular direction by Mendes.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Can't wait until the third book. I love the selection series. Seriously I'll be biting my nails until the third installment comes out
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Similar to PC version 2.0 full version.<br />Nice graphics for a tablet game.<br />Children are delighted with this game they play.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|This album is just wonderful.  The music is so good with that big band sound.  Of course, how could you not love Michael Buble?  As the kids today say, &#34;He is the bomb!&#34;  I would recommend this album to everyone I know......especially my 13 year old grandson who plays the trumpet very well and is in the Jazz Band at school.  Thanks for having this available.

B0095P33IW|5.0|Well what can I say, who doesn't love Captain America.  Chris Evans has an amazing body and played the humble gentle hero.  What is not to like?  It had action - guns- hot body  with no shirt - fireworks - patriotism and planes.

B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Watching Downtown Abbey brings you back to a time in England that most of the time wants to draw you in with the different people,and you watch as their lives change. Like many movies you escape into the lead of a movie and you don't want it to end. Downtown Abbey you know as the different chapters evolve as you scroll through the dvd you know it has to end maybe with a happy ending or maybe with a cliffhanger that makes you wait till next season.........and what a long wait. It's worth it, why the mini series has so many different figures from the rich to the lowly kitchen maid that works there. Each person employed in the Abbey has a story,each member of the family has a story,So with so many different people there is so much going on.Maggie Smith as the family leader always has something smart to remark to in her conversations with others. You laugh,you cry,you are surprised ,astonished, overjoyed and puzzeled as you watch season 3 &#62; Maybe the best of the three seasons,What happens in season 4  you will want to know<br />I sure do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|...and sad and full of hope. Hoover's characters have depth, the story's very interesting, what's not to love? Read it

B00004WPAZ|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my mother who has not purchased much music in the last few years.  I don't think shes listened yet, but thats her business, not St Germain's.  I love the music and I love vinyl.  Both are a matter of taste, but if you like the idea of jazzy, chilled-out, electronic-yet-organic sounds in a vinyl LP format, then this is for you.  Still trying to convince mom, though.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great song, Daft Punk returns with a great sound, I totally recommend this song, it is a very upbeat and happy tune
B00866H7SS|3.0|A bit maddening, in fact. If this Gideon character wasn't good looking, Eva wouldn't have given him a second glance...So Day's moral is &#34;only good looking people get great sex&#34;?! I don't know
0307352153|5.0|This book was a life changer! First of all I learned I was an introvert which I never realized before because I am not shy and secondly, being an introvert has little to do with shyness. Basically the difference between an introvert and extrovert is how they react to stimulation. This book explained many of my  behaviors that I felt bad about, simply because I was unaware they were a result of my introverted nature, and in the end, made me feel good about myself.<br />I highly recommend this book.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|While slower than previous seasons, intent on building the &#34;side stories&#34;  of the personal interactions between characters, the pace picks up mid-season, and a few of the episodes have adrenaline building capacity that rivaled even the first season.  No complaints-  different, but not in a bad way. Looking forward to next season.  Team Daryl!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The show is different wondering what the new episods will be like cannot imagine going on with the same story line.  Love joe but doesn't he have to go  to change the story line.  We will see<br /><br />Ps sometimes it is gory but that's the story, right?
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Good movie, romantic with an unusual twist. I saw on TV once & had to buy it. Worth seeing again.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|An incredibly well made hack'n'slash game. Plenty of loot, varying enemies, abilities and classes make this game good, but the fact that it's a tablet game is incredible. The virtual control stick works well with the game, haven't had many serious control issues. Graphics are great, and there's even multiplayer! It's free, so you owe it to yourself to at least try this game out
B004EU1YZW|4.0|The plot was unique and strange-giving a particular view of life in Thatchers England. Daniel Day Lewis is so young and sweet...if you are a fan, this is a must see:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this games I play it all the time like the lay out and the auto finish..would tell others

0596527055|5.0|Interesting read. Needed for a college course I was taking & it had all the info I needed for working on 1 assignment. Enjoyed reading the book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I don't like horror movies that often because they lack a good plot this show definitely is not like that!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A truly disturbing Drama/Horror series that will keep you on edge the entire season. Great acting and a well driven plot
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really like this games another I play all the time recomend to friends. would buy more games along this line
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This is the eleventh book in the series that Lee Child has written and published. For me it was a very electrifying must read thriller from start to finish. I could not put it down once I started it. The story starts with a hovering helicopter 3,000 feet above the sandy desert floor in Southern California on a moonless night when a man is pitched out into the darkness. Wow, if that doesn't get you reading this story nothing will! Now at that very moment Jack Reacher is thousands of miles away at an ATM machine. He is broke and needs some traveling money. So he checks his balance. Lo and behold there is a message from an old Army buddy. He is to go to Southern California. When he arrives and meets with his old Army buddy life, as he knows it will never be the same again! The plot deals with more bad guys then you can shake a stick at and they are killing members of Jack Reacher's old Army MP investigator team. They were special and all friends. Who can be doing this and why? From that point on the story explodes into a race against time. As always in Jack Reacher's stories nothing is what it seems to be. Some clues are dead ends to nowhere but the bad guys are not invincible and do make mistakes. This is where Jack and his survivors of his old team capitalize to make for a very exciting thriller that just might keep you up at night. It sure did me and I loved it! Here is another winner from the author Lee Child. All I can say is &#34;Bravo Zulu&#34; for a job well done and thanks! But if you want to experience the story and find out how this current mystery &#34;Bad Luck and Trouble &#34; ends you have to read it. Enjoy!
B00127RAJY|4.0|When I decided several months ago it was time to get into shape I bought this DVD since I had heard so many great things about it.  It kicked my flabby butt into shape in about a week!  The first day on level 1 I could barely do one push-up and after a week I could do about 20!  I used 7 pound weights because those are what I had and I noticed a big difference in my upper body.  I moved onto levels 2 and 3 (level 3 is crazy and I had to buy 5 pound weights to get through it) and bought some of Jillian's other workouts (No More Trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, 6 Week 6 Pack, and Killer Buns and Thighs).  After trying out her other more dynamic workouts, I have not gone back to Shred.  What I've noticed about Shred as compared to Jillian's other DVDs is that she does many more reps in Shred which can get mentally tedious after awhile (and physically exhausting).  If you are looking for a similar workout with more variety I would recommend Ripped in 30, which uses the same circuit format as Shred but adds another move in the strength portion to break it up a bit. (It also includes 4 workouts instead of 3).<br /><br />All of Jillian Michaels' DVDs have given me great results beyond what I expected, and I want to speak specifically about the results I have gotten working out with her 5-6 days a week for the past several months. When I started I was not looking to lose weight but to tone and tighten, and I have since gained about 3-4pounds. I was initially surprised by this (I never thought exercise would make me GAIN weight) and occasionally after a workout I feel a bit \\"bulky\\" the next day. I read that weight training can cause the body to initially retain water but my weight gain has stayed pretty consistent since starting this routine. I wanted to mention this as I have only read reviews describing weight loss and that may not be the case for everyone. Overall I am very pleased with my results and look and feel much healthier and more athletic.<br /><br />Though I have moved onto her other workouts, Shred was the perfect place for me to start with Jillian and I would highly recommend it to start your fitness routine.
B005NS5CX4|4.0|This is a nice country cross over album with nice vocals a variety of songs that all provide a distinct sound. I have enjoyed listening to a number of songs on this album and the previous album from Lady Antebellum.
1936608898|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!  I did a whole30 challenge with my gym about 6 months before I read this book.  At first I was doubtful of the \\"it will change your life\\" claim, but the results convinced me otherwise. I've dealt with digestive problems for over 20 years, that were resolved after 30 days on this plan.  I'm so thankful.  I try to maintain this way of eating most of the time, and the book just reinforced why I'm doing it (not to mention how much better I feel).
0920668372|2.0|I love reading to my grandchildren, so I buy books to keep at home so I can read to them when they come to visit.  This book was a disappointment.  I was expecting something that would be more applicable to toddlers.  The review says age range 1 and up but I feel it should be more like 4 and up.
0399226907|5.0|My Grand daughter loves the pictures. Very sturdy pages. You don't have to worry about them being ripped out of the book.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|The character of Jack Reacher developed by Lee Child hits the big silver screen with Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in a real blockbuster! Tom Cruise of course looks nothing like the book character. But he plays the role of Jack Reacher with gusto and because of the professional that he is he delivers 100% in the role. He is dynamite and nitroglycerine combined as he takes on all the bad guys to bring justice out of chaos. The story begins with a sniper in a parking garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shooting across a river to kill randomly. That is what the initial police investigators conclude. But as the clues are reviewed and the dots are connected nothing is what it seems. There is a criminal conspiracy at work here with an old Army sniper being framed for the killings.  But did he really do it? If you read the book, which this film was adapted from than you know how it all ends. But I always love to see if the film meets all my expectations. In this case the actors both the good ones and the bad ones did a very commendable job. Of course Tom Cruise stole the show! The adaptation was very honest and the film with fewer explosions adhered very well to the book. I would reveal the story’s source but I leave that up to each of you to figure out. Besides the character of Jack Reacher is more of a cerebral type of guy. He solves the problems first in his mind from what he knows based on the facts he receives as he works the crime scenes and then when it comes to action he does not hesitate to get it done! I also enjoyed seeing that great actor Robert Duvall playing a role of a retired Gunnery Sergeant owner of a gun range. In his own right he provide a nice balance for Tom Cruise in those scenes.  A movie's highlight is an excellent car chase scene between two roaring muscle cars on the dark streets of Pittsburgh with Cruise clearly and expertly handling the wheel himself. A capable English actress Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike plays the defense attorney for the accused. She is good and in the scenes she is in both Tom Cruise also provides great balance. Oh, have you figured out the name of the book in which Jack Reacher was adapted? No, not to worry you will have plenty of time to do that after you see the movie. If you think the credits will reveal the answer...wrong. You will never find it in the credits. I highly recommend this movie! If you are a Jack Reacher fan then you won't want to miss it. The movie will soon be out in DVD but if you can't wait then you can see it on Amazon.com in Instant video. I gave it five stars because adapting this movie to the big screen from a book that is filled with details seemed like an insurmountable task but all concern made the impossible look easy. It was an honest interpretation of why some people let greed take over their lives and become a destructive force in human relations. There is a great lesson there in that we reap what we sow!  Every act has consequences. If you plant good seed then you will have a great harvest. But the opposite is also true! The movie Jack Reacher gives us all a lesson in righteousness and how evil actions will bite you when you least expect it come hell or high water or as in no matter what happens and whatever may come you; you are in it for the long haul…that is what life is all about.d.

B000GWE44U|5.0|This is one of the freakiest horror films of all-time.<br /><br />Best of all, the scares come from excellent storytelling.  The movie is eerie from the get-go and showcases an interesting, dangerous dynamic between a husband, wife, and son.  There's not tons of gore or anything too obvious.  The tension builds slowly and can only lead to horrific results.<br /><br />Kubrick is a film-making master and this is one of his greatest works.  I've never read the book, So I can't compare it to that.  I can only say this:  On its own merits, this film is 5 stars and one of the best horror flicks of all time.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|It was a very intertaining movie and the actors were really good.  I could have done without all the blood though.  Not for kids.
B006ZNRD06|4.0|This is a great little player.  It's simple for my small tablet, and that is what I wanted.  I have not had a chance to use it a lot, so I don't know how well it plays all formats.
B006G7R25W|5.0|good flick..Howard Hughes' favorite..Before all the spy novel films, this one was setting the standard.. Mix of politics, spys, military and civilian policy in action
B004OZZ624|3.0|Exciting movie. Pretty intense with an interesting plot. A little unbelievable at some points but was entertaining. I enjoyed the build up to the ending sequence though some of the scenes were pretty far fetched.
B008602KQI|3.0|Their is nothing wrong with this film, it's not anything special. Feels rushed at parts, I expect better in the second one.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This a weird movie, but it's a thrillingly odd ride with great acting and directing.<br /><br />This is Stanley Kubrick's final film and it rivals many of his other films for its mysterious nature.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are awesome.<br /><br />Words can't really do justice to this movie.  You just have to watch it.  I'd only recommend it if you enjoy exploring very unusual, nontraditional films.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|Although my (picky) husband thought it was a bit slow, we all (7 year old and mom) enjoyed the movie. Loved the creativity and thoughtful message.
B008D37J6O|4.0|It was o.k.  I could not get it to work properly with my tablet, so I deleted it.  I used it on a Pandigital tablet, which is android based.
B003Z49LYO|3.0|I chose this rating because there were things that I could learn about the lives about people who lived at this time.  Like the family in the story and Tess.  How hard it was for women.  How unfair life seems at times when we have to pay so much for injustices done to us. Example with Tess.  The actors did a good job.<br />I just don't see the necessity of having to portray imtimacies on screen.  Leave it to the ones watching to use their own imaginations. So I did't much care for the ending.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Despite the age group targeted by this book, I was hooked immediately and unable to leave it down. If I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Once I finished the first I was straight back to Amazon for the next 2 copies which I tore through in several days.
1402238843|5.0|Loved having a copy after all this time and a wonderful read.I have quite a collection of Heyer books and like adding to it
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Saw the show live several times.  This DVD set is wonderful because it not only lets you see the show as though you were sitting in the audience in Vegas (although it's edited like a music video ... very choppy), then takes you behind the scenes to see backstage and technical highlights of putting on a multi-million dollar Vegas spectacular.<br /><br />If you're a true Celine Dion fan, this is a must have.<br /><br />EXCELLENT!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Can't go wrong with Honor.  Weber really knows his stuff.  you should read the whole series over and over again.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|I loved this book and was sad when it ended. Morgenstern does a wonderful job taking her readers deep inside the circus.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I would rate more stuff if I could just give the stars and not have to write something.  3 more words.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I couldn't imagine how this would finish. I almost inhaled the words and went straight on to the next one. I thoroughly enjoyed the authors imagination and inventiveness.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My 8 and 11 year old love the game. It lets them play interactively in a world to solve problems. Side benefit they work on spelling as each item is spelled into the world
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Not good.  Seemed like no one, from the writer to the actors, cared about this movie.  It felt like a joke.  Everyone in this movie has put out a much better film and are great actors in their own right. I'm sure this is one they would all like to forget.
1780721676|5.0|This book is an interesting reading experience as well as an introduction and guide to a workable diet plan. I admit to being unsure about the \\"Fasting \\" but after the first complete cycle it has become very easy to do. The book spells out the whys and the how's. They even include some great tasting ideas for meals on your fast days. And yes you do not starve on fast days. You just limit your calories to 600 a day for men, 500 a day for ladies. Then eat normally for the other 5 days. Best of all I am losing weight.
B002S45V32|4.0|I liked the all star cast, especially Jon Cryer. He should have gotten an award. Great acting! I had never seen this movie and thoroughly enjoyed watching a teenage flick at my age!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is easy and calming. I really like this game.<br />My kids like it too!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Despite the doom and gloom of the subject and the losses I still couldn't put it down. When I finished I started over again as I missed the characters and story.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Good challenging game. Not too difficult, but makes you think. I would recommend this for anyone who likes escape games.
B001UE27X8|5.0|Lifelong Tony fan, and lover of piano jazz. Combine the two on these recordings and I think you've got the pinnacle of recorded music- great tunes, heartfelt singing, and brilliant piano arrangements!
B006JRY2QG|5.0|The sons is a great show. And getting it online allowed me to catch up wherever I go. For sure worth the money and if you have prime it's FREE!!!
B008TSVZHM|5.0|The item was for a friend who kept on losing their microSD. This item helped a tons in organizing all their tiny microSDs. The one thing I disliked about the card was that it seemed flimsy, but that's a preference that does not reflect on the item.
