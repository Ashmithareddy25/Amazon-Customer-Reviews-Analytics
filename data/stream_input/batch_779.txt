B0014I4KIK|4.0|Dusty Springfield, Lulu, Amy Winehouse, suggested as influences. Okay. Perhaps her biggest influence is Amy Correia? I can even hear some Billie Holliday on these tracks.<br />That's all good for the coffeehouse confab., but I'm so taken with<br />\\"Mercy\\", (which just might be a Grammy winner for 2008), with its' retro go-go 2/4 with alotta fat and funky bottom, a great, soulful vocal - wow! - do I hear a melodic tremolo coming from her jewel-lined voice-box? - that I might accidentally reach for a white instead of brown sugar for my triple-E.<br />The title and finale songs have alot of feeling and atmosphere, but once she has established she can really deliver a \\"beat ballad\\", the listener, though already affably initiated to this exotic new stylist, will hope that the next CD will have three or four in the \\"Mercy\\" vein.<br />Of course, we have a personal statement here in this debut, as Duffy is co-writer of the opus, so let's let go of the coulda-shouldas and lend those good new headphones (still in the impossible-to-open plastic bubble) to some AM sounds from Duffy: meaning that the notes bounce back off the 4am clouds right into your eardrums.

B0009VRHLK|4.0|I have not seen the original Director's cut of the film that had created so much bad press after the screening at the Cannes Film Festival and prompted Roger Ebert make the statement that \\"The Brown Bunny\\" was the worst film in the history of the festival but the 92 minutes long version that Gallo himself re-edited is certainly not the bad movie. I'd say it is much better than hundreds of one star reviews on the Netflix movie's site lead you to believe. I personally agree with Vienalle Film Festival that awarded to \\"The Brown Bunny\\"  FIPRESCI Prize \\"For its bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American filmmaking\\". In  exploring loss, regrets, yearning, grief, loneliness, inner numbness as the way to cope with pain caused by guilt, longing for the contact and inability to communicate, Vincent Gallo, writer/director/star/cinematographer/editor for \\"The Brown Bunny\\", definitely drove his point across (no pun intended). I think that Gallo found the right way to create a mood of quiet and unbearable desperation. The movie brought to my mind the line from one of the poems by  Paul Verlen, French poet of the 18th century, \\"I walked, accompanying my own grief\\".  Grief was the passenger in Bud's van and kept him company on the long journey across America, from New Hampshire to California. They had a lot to talk about but their conversations were speechless - that's why there is so much silence in the movie and only shots of Bud's face and his eyes.<br /><br />Many viewers (and reviewers) mention in their comments the notorious explicit scene of oral sex between Bud Clay (Gallo) and Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), the one true love of his life. Those who dismissed the movie as totally worthless say that without the scene, nobody would every bother watching \\"The Brown Bunny\\". I would not speak for everyone but I would've liked the film even without two minutes of graphic sex  that in the context of the film is appropriately more disturbing and sad than anything else. With all due respect to the opinions of the viewers who dislike and even hate Vincent Gallo's movie, I found it interesting, compelling and satisfying.y more disturbing and sad than anything else.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|The Cliff's Notes version of my review would read:  'I find In Rainbows too beautiful, too dense, too tender and too tough to listen to without concentrating on the nuances in each and every track.'    The music is worth absorbing to the last drop, particularly the savage delicacy of 'All I Need', the Spanish tinged 'House of Cards', and the nicely orchestrated 'Faust Arp'.    At times the percussion dominates the mix, but hasn't this been tagged as 'experimental' rock?       Particularly nice to hear Radiohead's unmistakeable stamp on new material.  While 'The Eraser' was and is a treasure, I missed the texture and timbre that return here in abundance.   Satisfying to listen to all at once, or to indulge the guilty pleasure of repeating a song or two.
B0014KD46W|4.0|How many artists produce their best work when they're 59? That's what Winwood has done here -- at least if you're only talking about his solo work.    With the exception of \\"I'm Not Drowning\\" and \\"Dirty City,\\" this disc stays more or less with the Latin-ish groove that characterized 2003's ABOUT TIME. But while that disc was smoother and more consistent, Winwood's decision to so severely limit the instrumentation was a bit too restricting. That problem doesn't show up here.    Winwood's emphasis on \\"the groove\\" as opposed to other elements of the music (he's long had the odd ability to make lyrics seem unimportant even while singing them with great feeling) means that his songs often work better as driving music or \\"up-front background music\\" than anything else. Those who want something to sing along with may not be impressed with a lot of this disc, but those who appreciate a good groove (like fans of '70s Traffic) will.
B000683VI4|2.0|I heard good things about this movie.  I finally got around to watching it, and when it was over I was left wondering what all the hype was about.  The story is typical, and the characters are nothing fantastic. Rachel McAdams plays a particularly unlikeable character, a spoiled tart/southern bell. Ryan Gosling is just a lowly pauper child, who falls for this twit for reasons unknown. His character did not serve his acting skills any justice.  The story line brings nothing new to the genre of romance. Also, the ending is beyond far fetched.  Id even go to say it insults the life of anyone who has ever had Alzheimers.

Tales from Topographic Oceans changed the entire course of my musical career (and thus my life) when it first came out. I was stunned then, and still stunned to this day.     To all of you who think you don't like this recording, give it several listens. I didn't like it the first three or four times I heard it, because I was stuck on concepts of what music should should sound like (you should be able to tap your feet, sing along, anticipate the changes, etc). But by the time I listened for the 4th or 5th time, I remember sitting there in a state of absolute awe and epistemological breakdown, in tears.      TFTO is one of the most creative, beautiful masterpieces of music the world has ever been gifted with.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Sony finally delivers what it promised to deliver, and what it should have delivered with the console.  The Dualshock 3 is a much healthier weight in your hands, and the vibrations range from nearly undetectable murmurs to healthy thumps.  The rest of the pads functionality remains near identical to the SIXAXIS, with the exception of battery life.  It's not taken a substantial hit, but it is slightly shorter.  I don't think that will cause anybody any concerns, but expect to charge the pad after a few days of playing.

B0016IV2G6|5.0|Past...In Different ways...and what a past it was for kiske. Finally we observe that instead of dislike to its former years, he actually makes peace with it making it part of his solo work.     Voice-wise? you may ask, perhaps. His voice in this record is a demostration that despite what some thought by his older solo albums or even some collaborations, He is able to sing in all kind of tones, from low-mid-high pitch vocals equall or in some cases better than in his Helloween years. That is due to the fact of his voice been more mature and his gain of experience in vocal techniques. He is able to control much more elegantly his voice specially when on high notes. Its a remark that Kiske can sing with a beautiful elegant voice in almost any kind of music.     Musically, the album has a bit of everything. Some songs might sound almost the same, except for the fact no E-Guitars are used, and some solo/fills are changed. Some are way different making the songs almost fresh new. Some arrangements are so wonderful, and the fact that some mantain the epic sound, is quite impresive. The start of the CD really blows your mind away, for me i would've never expect it that way. The Last song \\"Different Ways\\", for me, its one of the better tracks, as it shows how his writting and current works differ from that of his earlier years.     This is an album that I have no problems hearing over and over again. And the fact we get to listen to the Kiske-Helloween years with better sound-voice-arrangements quality is a must. In my opinion maybe a song or two needed a bit of a bigger change, but that depends on taste.     If you're really waiting for Helloween-alike sound, STOP! This are Michael Kiske's songs; some even before his helloween years, re-arranged in acoustic and with some keys been changed to fit the acoustic sound.
B0013FNC38|3.0|Ever since I first heard Jason Mraz in 2003, his songs have been played more on my computer/cd player/ipod than any other artist - over and over and over.  He writes some incredible stuff, and his voice is one of if not the absolute best out there.  I immediately fell in love with \\"Waiting for my Rocket to Come.\\"  A few years later, I was also very satisfied with \\"Mr.A-Z\\", although it felt a little over-produced at times.    I had heard mixed reviews about \\"We Sing...\\" before it was released, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I've had the album for a few days now and have gone through it many times getting acquainted with the songs, trying to give them a chance to catch on in my head.  I've had a lot of trouble putting my finger on it, but it generally just doesn't grab me like his first two albums do.  There are only a few songs that compel me to hit repeat - \\"Lucky\\", \\"Coyotes\\", \\"If it Kills Me\\", and \\"I'm Yours\\" (obviously, any Mraz fan already loves this one).  The rest of the songs just don't stand out to me like his songs usually do.    The album as a whole is a lot more mellow, far too much so I think.  I miss the upbeat feels of \\"Curbside Prophet\\", \\"WordPlay\\", and \\"Please Don't Tell her.\\"  It's too easy for me to tone out to most of the songs and just allow them to be background music for whatever else I'm doing.  That doesn't necessarily make them bad, but it just isn't what I'm used to from Jason Mraz.  The ballads lack the luster that \\"Absolutely Zero\\" contains.  \\"Love for a Child\\" comes close, but it seems a little too depressing for me to enjoy repeatedly.    I went back and played some tracks from the other two albums, and they instantly confirmed what I had been thinking.  They're simpler, lighter, and just more fun to listen to.    Maybe this is just Jason trying new things as an artist.  Maybe I'm more underwhelmed by this CD simply because the first two were so fantastic.  It seems like a lot of artists do something a little different with the thirdproject.  In a lot of ways, it's still the Jason we all love, but in a lot of other ways, it sounds like someone completely different, and not necessarily in a good way.  Like others have said, I think this album suffers from a lot of production that just wasn't needed.    I've tried to give this CD the best chance I can, but I think if I had heard this without the first two albums, I would be a lot less impressed by Jason Mraz.  As must as it pains me to do so, I'd rate it a 3.5/5 overall.  I'm a little disappointed and hope Jason's next album is more like the spirit of the first two.

0307383415|5.0|I was moved in reading this.  Obama writes this from a time before he was a politician.  There is a freshness here, a willingness to be vulnerable, that no politician, even as honest a one as Obama, can fully approach.  This felt like pure biography, a window into Obama's soul.<br /><br />I came to understand who Obama is.  He is truly a child of two continents, and multiple cultures.  He is Kansas, and Hawaii, and Indonesia, and Kenya.  And it isn't enough to say that he has the blood of those peoples, and has lived in those lands.  He is also a mixture of those cultures, for all their familiarity and strangeness to Western eyes.  He is the child of a father with multiple wives, and a great grandfather living in a mud home.  He witnesses poverty in Indonesia and comes from a family line of poverty- not the easy poverty of the U.S., but the extreme form of the 2/3rds World.  He takes parts of all his family, and weaves them into his own narrative, developing a commitment to justice and equality as a white American, and a black African.<br /><br />This book felt personal to me.  I grew up in a foreign culture, and lived in Hawaii.  I went to Occidental College, and have a father with multiple wives, who had a wanderlust bigger than he could contain.  Obama did all this, had all these experiences.  He copied me- he just did it exactly ten years before I did.  And so throughout the book, I kept on thinking of where I was when he writes.  I'm being born in a foreign culture when Obama is living in Hawaii.  As Obama begins his work for the poor in the South Side of Chicago, I am going to live in Hawaii with my family, beginning my own dreams.  And, to a very small measure, my story becomes interwoven with Obama's.<br /><br />Obama's family history is even more amazing.  Towards the end of the book Obama's grandmother tells the story of their family. It begins with a genealogy, of who begat whom. Then we come to Opuyo, who traveled from a faraway land in Kenya to a land he didn't know. Opuyo sired Obama (first name), who was not the eldest brother, and therefore didn't have land or wealth. He ended up working for another, wealthier family. He worked so hard that the family became very impressed by him, and gave Obama their daughter in marriage.<br /><br />Obama married others, and built up his lands, so that his son, Onyango, came from a family of means. But at this time the white man was entering the land that would be Kenya. Onyango alone of his village saw the potential of this new world, and left the land of his people's to work for the whites in other areas of Kenya, and in other African countries. Though he was often ostracised by his family, Onyango learned the white's ways, and was therefore the first of his village to understand modern life and technology, and used that to his advantage, gaining more wealth and lands. He took many wives, and one son was born Barack Hussein Obama, who had a son by the same name, who later went on to run for President of the United States.<br /><br />Do these stories sound at all familiar? Consider. Barack Obama's grandma began her story with begats. She then told of Abraham, going to a land that was not his own. Abraham's grandson Jacob was not the eldest son, so he worked for his uncle Laban for many years, and eventually won the right to marry Laban's daughters. Jacob's son Joseph was often ostracised by his family, and went to the foreign land of the Egyptians to learn their ways, becoming a man of great wealth. The similarities are rather eerie.<br /><br />Sometimes I sit and imagine how God might have appeared to Ipuyo, just as he did to Abraham, telling him to go to a new land. He would say that he would bless Ipuyo, if he is willing to take this risk and trust in the Lord, and one day his descendant, a descendant he would never meet, this descendant would become great in a faraway land that Ipuyo had never heard of. Or God might come to Obama (first name) when Obama had no work and nohope. God calls Obama to trust in him, and one day a descendant with his name, his great grandson, would rise to become the most powerful man in the world.<br /><br />And this descendant would be a child of promise, who would obtain this position as long as he walked in humility and followed the ways of God, using his power to serve others, just as King David did.  Obama's life, the lives that made him, are so steeped in Biblical parallel, that one almost expects the tear-filled conversion to Jesus Christ when Obama shares it half-way through the book.<br /><br />This is the kind of window into who Obama is that this book provides.  We see here that Obama truly comes from a more communal culture, a culture where family matters, and family means your uncles, aunts, grandparents, great grandparents, second cousins, and all the ancestors.  This is who Obama is, and I would recommend it to all who would seek to know who Obama is.  Come November you may end up voting for him, or you may vote against him.  I would counsel you not to make a decision either way until you have come to read this book.day a descendant with his name, his great grandson, would rise to become the most powerful man in the world.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This Western- sci fi is so satisfying.  The characters are beautifully drawn the messages are  basic , loyalty, love and never overpowering   or politically correct.  Many shows may try to emulate it  but I fear they will fail.  watch it with the movie Serenity and you will have a nice 14 hour movie.  I missed the fan days when my voice might have made a difference in getting another movie out o the series continued, but  who knows.     You will like this even if you are not a sci- fi or western fan.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I've always liked Daft Punk, for me, but their albums never stay in rotation for more than a couple weeks without getting old. This live cd, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing-- I've had it for a few months now, and it still blows my mind.    You really feel the energy of the crowd in these songs, and you feel like you're right there if you close your eyes. I've heard the live show is \\"the best concert anyone has ever been, or will go, to\\", in the words of a friend. This album does a pretty good job of getting that point across.    The remixes of the songs are fantastic-- the melodies of different songs intertwine wonderfully. My favorites on the album are \\"Robot Rock/Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Television Rules The Nation/Crescendolls\\". Seriously, though, you won't find a fault with any of the songs. They're all great, easy to love, and even easier to dance to.    If you're a fan of electronic music, you HAVE to buy this. It's easily the best house/electronic album I've heard in a long time.

B000J103OI|5.0|When this film came out and the buzz began about Streep's Oscar worthy performance, I didn't find the time to see it.  Now that it's on DVD, I am eating it up like a Junior's Cheesecake (New Yorkers will know what I mean).  Here is why I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film:  I had a boss like Miranda Priestly once.  The first day she placed her dirty lunch tray on my \\"out\\" box I knew the job was not going to be good on my psyche.  In fact, much like Andy as the aspiring writer, I wrote my first college A+ essay on the trials of being someone's assistant thanks to the material my former boss gave me.  In comparison, at least Andy's job had the perks of the fashion industry like shoes, clothes and accessories; mine just had the late nights and lowly paycheck.<br /><br />Nevertheless, back to my review.  Streep is on point as the \\"Dragon Lady\\" Miranda, editor in chief of RUNWAY magazine (the equivalent of VOGUE).  Her subtle glances of disapproval, slight snicker and tilt of the head, all speak volumes while hapless assistant, Andy, is trying her best to get the job done.  Having no background in the fashion industry or its demands, she stumbles along trying to win over the respect or at least appreciation of her coworkers and superiors, all of whom seem to take pleasure in humiliating her in every area from her onion breath to the way she clops around in what looks like a pair of clumsy Payless loafers.<br /><br />The sheer materialism is no joke, this is really how it is in MANY corporate offices, not just in fashion, but also in the beauty industry, advertising and the list goes on.  Give the wrong person a title and it will go to his or her head, making them behave as if somehow they are \\"above\\" the rest of us, they are irreplaceable, and maybe even immortal.<br /><br />The supporting characters are strong, especially Stanley Tucci as the senior designer who bascially takes Andy under his wing to transform her into a work of art, fashionably speaking.  His wit and sarcasm are perfect, and again, I worked with people like him so I totally related to his character.  The plot was predictable, and of course you get the sense that Andy will eventually disappoint her friends by choosing work over partying, but that in the end her conscience will take over and .... well, I don't want to be a spoiler here.  Enjoy this for what it's worth, not for anything earth shattering or new, but for a sometimes comical, always sarcastic look at life in the world of high fashion.  Plus, the on location filming in New York City is awesome, as is the soundtrack, chock full of hits from Madonna to U2 and Alanis Morissette.again, I worked with people like him so I totally related to his character.

6305308659|1.0|I'm not sure who wrote, directed, or produced \\"Pleasantville\\" but clearly there is a radical leftist agenda underlying this movie.  Whoever is behind this film is using it to shatter the nostalgic view that most Americans have about the 1950's: traditional family, religion, celibacy, self-restraint, moral order, etc. while at the same time, promoting immorality as \\"cool\\" and \\"good\\".  At work in this film is something called \\"Cultural Marxism\\", the process of tearing down traditional moral Western society (towards preparing for an eventual Marxist state).  One element of Cultural Marxism is to create disorder and even chaos by promoting liberal lifestyles which are known to be destructive (we see such promotion in this film).  The idea is to \\"normalize\\" deviant behavior, yet knowing full well the eventual outcome will be misery for all.  Marxists rationalize such destruction with, \\"the end will justify the means\\", ie. \\"first we have to destroy the 'oppressive' United States before we can build our dream utopia\\".  Back when I was in college (early 60's) I knew several students and professors who preached this type of thinking.  They were shockingly open about it, saying things like, \\"we'll make films and TV shows which will gradually condition Americans into accepting ever more deviant and destructive lifestyles, and in 50 years, this nation will rot from it's own decadence\\".  In that time (early 1960's) things were still very innocent in America and I ignored what they said as words of crazy radicals.  But one thing was clear, they hated this country with a passion, and they were determined to destroy it.  The message of the film is, \\"moral standards are bad\\" and \\"as long as it feels good, it is good\\".  Very sick, twisted thinking.  Quite evil actually.  I will find out who made this film and investigate their other work and background.

B00140PK6O|5.0|U.S. television programming is at an all time low of mindless, degrading  stupidity, violence and sexuality. Most times it is hardly worth turning  on. Thank God for BBC. Cranford is a little masterpiece of charm, wit  and warmth. The soap opera of the 1800's. Two secrets to British movies  and television---characters always look like real people. They are engaging to watch because they look so interesting and different. The  U.S. market continually hires the same look of a thirty year old, beautiful mannequin or an elderly woman who has had plastic surgery to  look like a thirty year old. Everyone is so homogenized in the L.A. look  that it is akin to watching science fiction. Add gratuitous sex and a  poorly written plot and you have our \\"made for TV\\" movies and most sitcoms. Brit actors are a rich tapestry of the human face and it pays off. Secondly, Cranford is filmed and costumed in a sort of \\"sepia\\" tone  which fits the time and place. The gray, green, brown of most--the interior dingy atmosphere is true to homes of the period. Contrast is  scarce (the wealthy, the color of imported silks, a May Day celebration) but  very effective. I will watch this series over and over and visit my new  friends in Cranford. I have read in British newspapers online that the  actors have all signed on to do a Christmas (in Cranford) special to   reprise the characters so we have something to look forward to.

0143038419|5.0|This is a wonderful book that details a woman's journey to find herself. It is extremely well written and easy to read.  I would recommend it to anyone who has gone or is going through a journey to find out the person they really are.  It is especially good for people who have gone through a divorce or other life changing event.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am a 50-something female who curiously attended the screening of this movie. I went home and immediately got on a wait-list for the DVD release. I love the Beatles and to hear the different arrangements of their music woven into a timeless story wowed me.  It still does each time I watch this DVD.  A definite keeper for the musical lover,
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is a great classic British Comidy from the 1970's.  I loved it then, and it is still as funny in 2008.
B000RO9PRS|1.0|This DVD sucked it was like who ever made it was trying to promote their album.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Gerard Butler is HOT and all those ripped men are fabulous to look at.  The cinema style is great, the action and humor rock.  It's a great guilty pleasure.
B0013FBS20|4.0|This film is perfect for HD; it's absolutely stunning visually.  Will Smith offers a very complex and nuanced performance for a Sci-Fi actioner as well.  Also, the alternate ending is terrific; it is much more thought-provoking and more in keeping with the original novel.  Don't bother with the original ending, even if you've never seen it.
B0010358D0|4.0|Great visuals, fun combat scenes. Story starts off ok but I didn't care for the finale, too old school video game like and not the usuall gritty realism i'd expect from Appleseed.     Still it's a fun movie and worth a watch.
B00005JPNY|4.0|The His Dark Materials series is my favorite book series to date. It's truly amazing.  I watched this movie late last year when it came out and I loved it from the beginning to the end. I had seen a review where it was given thumbs down by both critics. I think I would give it a thumbs up without even thinking too hard about it.  The graphics were some of the best I've seen, the acting was a lil' more than average and they took out / rearranged many things. The movie without reading the books is awesome, but reading the books just makes the movie clearer. They missed one or two vital points from the book, including a death of a character that makes a whole chain of events happen.  Overall, this is amazing without the books and still pretty good with the books. Anyone who sees this movie should stop by their local book store and pick up the series. They won't let you put them down. ;3
B0015AARJI|3.0|Its a lot better than before because of the return of the force feedback feature (rumble).    BUT it is a bit too light.  Wish the controller was a bit bigger, but overall it does that job.    The weight being on light side, makes me give it only 3 stars :- 
0596527055|4.0|We have a tendency to consider innovation to consist of divine inspiration to a humble few.  Berkun demonstrates that this makes good stories, but it is far from the truth.  Many innovations did appear in a sudden burst...after a decade of work in that direction.  I particularly like the section where he discusses better framing of the problem can be more important than the solution.    I really want to give this book 3.5 stars, mainly due to the constant appearance of off-topic footnotes.  Sometimes they have information, sometimes a story, sometimes a reference.  It really kills my train of thought to skip around like that; maybe he's trying to make reading like web surfing.  But perhaps that was done to keep the book short and sweet; there are interesting side thoughts, but he doesn't explore them all.    Also, the book has a weighted bibliography, which I've never seen before.
0618918248|5.0|I really am a fan of Dr. Dawkins. The world needs a lot more people like him, people who keep the ideas of Carl Sagan to heart and live and learn by asking people to \\"show\\" them rather than tell them.    The book, if you're an intellectual free-thinker, will be much like him preaching to the choir. If you're 'smart' enough to understand and take away from what he's talking about then surely you'll enjoy it. If you're religious, perhaps not -- but hopefully you'll at least take a stab at it for perspective if nothing else. And as Amazon's moronic review of the book suggests, NO, it doesn't provide good enough proof that the world will be better off without religion. Surely, that's an easy thing to do, how could Dawkins overlook such a minute detail!?    The most beautiful perspective that you can see the world through is by using the lens of reason. The Earth, its people, and all of the things within it and beyond it are more beautiful with each and every discovery science makes and I do feel bad that this book doesn't communicate well with the opposition -- but then again, when people are willing to kill, shackle, and bound others for their beliefs, I doubt words, no matter how profound, will matter much.    I do get a bit peeved when our reality is labeled the \\"natural world\\" and the impossible and illogical gets called \\"supernatural\\" -- what's more fantastic than what we have before us!?    Read the book!
B00005JOA0|4.0|I throughly enjoyed the \\"Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\".  It was a wonderful story with great characters.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Excellent coming-out themed movie that really strikes out of what is commonly seen in these stories. Although the end could have been detailed more, the movie still left us with a feel-good feeling after seeing it. I'll definitively go for the DVD as soon as its available !
B000001E7V|4.0|Listening to Maxinquaye, it's clear that Tricky had to break with Massive Attack. His vision was just too different. Maxinquaye is a dense, heavily textured album, more like a sound collage than a pop record. Massive Attack's albums, by contrast, have a clean and direct pop approach, especially Protection, which prompted Tricky's departure.    Maxinquaye feels \\"dirty,\\" in the sense of something fertile and organic, fashioned from soil and resin. There are no clean distinctions between instruments. \\"Hell Is Round The Corner\\" pulses with weird, wafting samples of vocals and keyboards, glued to the lazy drums, like honey languidly dripping down the wall of a huge beehive. Tricky's bizarrely distorted, insect-like vocals complete the analogy. The percussion is recognizable as an instrument, but it has none of the clean thump of the drum machines used in typical electronica. The bone-dry rattle in \\"Ponderosa\\" doesn't quite sound like a live performance, but it doesn't sound like a machine either. It's like something the hive played by itself.    Of course, Tricky's style still owes a lot to Massive Attack. Like them, he varies his vocalists (there are four in all, including him). He doesn't even take the lead until the fourth track, and even when his voice is prominent, it usually shares the song equally with Martina Topley-Bird, the album's main voice. She's quite a find. Her voice expresses absolute detachment, occasionally tinged with resignation. Her performance in the cover of Public Enemy's \\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\" surpasses Chuck D himself, and this despite the fact that her voice expresses no bluster or aggression, just hopeless urgency. She also finds a very peculiar vocal style for that song, a half-sung rap that follows a crazed dance rhythm. That one song might make the album worth the price. Elsewhere, she sings more conventionally, but generally refrains from excessive displays of emotion. Detachment is the order of the day here.    Also making anappearance is Allison Goldfrapp, before her solo career, but after her eye-catching turn on Orbital's Snivilisation. In \\"Pumpkin,\\" she gives an extremely incoherent performance (much like on the Orbital album), drawing out the syllables in every word until it's impossible to tell what she's saying. But on this album, that's somehow fitting -- her voice sinks into the swampy ambient muck and becomes part of the dripping honey.    Despite the dense sound, the album surprisingly still has a lot of pop appeal. Most notably on \\"Aftermath,\\" where the hook is created by a muted guitar tone, set to a dance beat, both undercut by ambient rumbling. There are no pop-style choruses, just recurring vocal lines, occasional sharp breaks in the rhythm, and a flute that strains from the blurry background. But the interplay between these elements is very memorable.    So, this is a fascinating and original album. But, even though Maxinquaye is denser, richer and probably more musically inventive than Protection, I still prefer Massive Attack's album. Sorry, Tricky. Massive Attack combine earthiness and sensuality with a kind of lonely romantic warmth. \\"Protection\\" encourages \\"you\\" to help a depressed friend, and suggests that they'll help you later when you need it. Tricky exchanges such quaint notions for decadence and dysfunction, which can also be depicted powerfully in music. But his persona does not make these topics compelling.    Sadly, Tricky is not much of a writer. All of his best lines on this album are recycled from his verses on \\"Karmacoma\\" and \\"Eurochild\\" from Protection. In addition to plagiarizing himself, he also lifts from \\"Ghosts\\" by Japan to fill out the end of \\"Aftermath.\\" The original lines that he wrote for this album are much more simple both in rhythm and content.    Tricky doesn't make much of an impression as an MC either. Again this is because his non-recycled lines are simplistic, so there's not much room to show off. But Robert del Naja's rapping on Protection runs circles around Tricky's performances here. It was a wise decision to retreat into the shadows and let Martina handle most of the vocals. The one time where Tricky takes a shot at a full-blown rap song, on \\"Brand New You're Retro,\\" he's strangely unconvincing. He engages in typical thug posturing, but he doesn't sound tough at all. He actually sounds more like an overly sensitive teenage boy lashing out impotently at people who are laughing at him.    Most importantly, Tricky is just not very charismatic. He sounded good in Massive Attack, as a darker counterpoint to Robert del Naja, but when he's by himself, he sounds like a sullen, uninteresting narcissist who uses his alleged inner torment as an excuse to be callous. When the time comes to bring all the different threads of the album together with some kind of unifying theme, the best he can come up with is, \\"They say I'm insane, but I'm more normal than most / Struggling so hard.\\" And why is he struggling so hard? Because he's \\"exhausted with the mundane,\\" which is how high school students justify cutting class. And then the self-aggrandizing rhetorical question: \\"Do you know what it's like to struggle? Have you ever had to struggle?\\" And so forth, on and on like this, repeating the word \\"struggling\\" over and over, all of this taking place in an unbearably long track appropriately called \\"Struggling.\\" It's also the least musically interesting track on the album -- Tricky's mumbling is upfront, backed only by crashing drums and Martina's uncharacteristically hysterical vocalizing.    Because of this, the album leaves a mixed impression. One can't help but admire the unique sound, but in the end it feels somewhat hollow. Like a play that has elaborate and original set design, but mediocre dialogue. So it's worth a look, but it falls short of classic status.

1401216676|4.0|The book shows an interesting perspective on how the Joker came to be. Made him more of a tortured and dark character (much like what Frank Miller did to Batman). Short and sweet, pick up this book if you want to see the direction that Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan took for the Joker character.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The Shred excercise tape is very good. I have lost inches and people can tell the difference.  Also her workout has help to strengthen my ankle which I broke about a year ago.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Cranford strikes just the right balance between absurdity and heart.  The cast is first class.  The combined talent of this ensemble will astonish you, and they all act with incredible restraint.<br />The screenplay is very well crafted--seeming to draw equally the fleshing out of the strange characters, and the fleshing out of the various plots.  Anyone who has lived in a small town will certainly appreciate the idiosyncrasies of such a community, and see parallels to their own life in the lives of the Cranford residents.<br />I highly highly recommend this series.  I could watch it over and over.

I mainly play Warhawk online and think that this definitely adds to the overall experience that a user has during the game.   The controller feels solid and holds a charge well.  Overall I think this controller is good and look forward to using it with more games that take advantage of it's technology.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opens with some teenagers in full 50s regalia speeding down a dirt road in Nevada, past a convoy of military vehicles.  They engage the first vehicle in line in a drag race, and then speed off into the distance as the military vehicles turn right and head down another dirt road.    It's not long before Indiana Jones makes his first appearance, when a couple of bodies are hefted from the trunk of one of the military vehicles and thrown to the dirt.  A hat also lands in the dirt.  A hand reaches down and picks up the hat, and then Indy's shadow is cast on the vehicle.  He is, as always, in a jam.  The villain who wants to use him to her own ends is a sexy and severe Russian with a passion for knowledge, played by Cate Blanchett.  She, along with the rest of the cast, is wonderful.    And yet, I found the movie disappointing.  Taken in pieces it's smart and exciting, but overall something was lacking.  Toward the beginning of the movie Indiana Jones acknowledges his age.  I thought that this would be an interesting evolution for his character and the movie, and I hoped that his age would be addressed again--perhaps he could have had to rely more on his wits or his companions.  But any other references to his age and changes in how he conducts his missions accordingly were absent from the film.  There is, I suppose, one surprise when his long ago lover and true love pops onto the scene and reveals something to Indy as they're sinking in quick sand.  But otherwise this movie just gives the viewer the same things that worked in the other movies: Exotic locations, a handful of tight jams that Indy and his crew always manage to get out of, humor, historical mystery and action scenes.  I suppose that's a lot, but I would have found my attention more closely riveted to the screen if I thought Indy might actually be in danger, or if I truly feared what the Russians might do with the skull if they possessed its power.  It seemsthat Hollywood just cranked out another formulaic sure thing, instead of taking any chances.  The only real change was the outlandishness of some of the action scenes.  After Indy's jeep made it over three huge waterfalls without anybody in the vehicle getting injured, the film critic I went to the preview with started laughing.  So I guess it's fair to say that the film is humorous and entertaining, and viewers who like over-the-top action scenes won't be disappointed.
B0013D8LCW|3.0|Despite the Amazon listing (see \\"Format\\") this DVD has no closed captions or subtitles, which will be bad news for about 9 million deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the United States who, gay or straight, might otherwise enjoy this beautiful film. No assortment of \\"Special Features\\" can compensate for the deficiency.    This omission is especially unfortunate as it comes from Here! Films and Liberation Entertainment, producers of gay films, whose management ought to be more sensitive to other disadvantaged minorities. That Genius Entertainment also had a hand in producing this DVD may serve as a caveat. Hoping to find captions on a DVD from Genius is (as my grandfather used to say) like buying a pig in a poke. Seven out of eight Genius/Rhi DVDs that I own lack closed captions and subtitles.    Federal trade laws ought to require disclosure of captions and subtitles (and the lack of them) on all DVDs sold.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I hadn't the opportunity to watch it when it was on air. I started watching this Serie from 2nd season. And I really loved this First Season, how it starts, the story, the places, it is very well produced and everything.. it's not the life of some stupid kids, it has a lot more to offer.

B0018CAAN6|1.0|Whatever happened to tunes? Melodies? Remember those? Hip-hop is destroying music, and unfortunately Madonna jumps on board with this album. Next to American Life, this is Madonna's worst outing...ever. Sad. If you really want good dance pop, try her last album or anything by the Pet Shop Boys (except for Release).
B0014KD46W|5.0|First, I concur that if your looking for the abject dross that seemed to constitue lil' Stevie Winwood from the disaster of 'Roll With It' up to(but not including) apparently with this ears, 'About Time.' This CD is not for you. On the other hand there are referents to songs nicely buried referring to 'Back In The High Life Again.' I hear them, does anyone else?    I need not recapitulate the history and accomplishment of Mr. Steve Winwood. The corpus of par excellent recordings adequately speaks for itself; At the same time a curious blandess and unfocusedness began with 'Roll With It.' 'Roll With It' was so lame, so bland and so empty of merit that it finally convinced me that Mr. Winwood had finally \\"lost it.\\"    I have always loved 'Winwood' the currently unhavable first solo album. Had it on vinyl. Miss it now. 'Talking Back To The Night' was okay. 'Back In The High Life Again' was a rather twisted return to form intermingling overt pop with something else.' Arc Of A Diver?' The jury is still out.    Then suddenly 'About Time' came out. Heard something from it and thought? Well, maybe he hasn't actually lost it. Don't have 'About Time.' On order.  The entire catalog of Traffic has been remastered. And the excellent 'Last Traffic Jam' has been released. All of which I have summarily noted.     Now, Nine Lives has been released. It's not a Winwood bland \\"Sellout.\\" See 'Roll With It.' Rather it is something akin to Traffic and his first album with kudos referents thrown to 'Back In The Highlife Again.'    Any Winwood fan already has heard \\"Dirty City.\\" The big question is whether this album can stand the test of time like the solo 'Winwood' or the timeless Traffic releases?    I'd say definitely, yes. Despite the more cynical reviews above; I think that this is a singular forward movement and yet a throwback to the jazz/blues/rhythm era of Winwood development. For those wide eyed cynics I say: Hell what do you want him to do? Reinvent the wheel?
B000088DSQ|2.0|Of the several recording I have for the Beethoven concertos, this simply sits on my shelf.  I return to it on odd occasions simply in an attempt to understand its appeal, but this still escapes me.  Although technically acceptable, I find all of the performances rather dull.    I would not recommend this as a first purchase of Beethoven's piano concertos for anyone.  Although it is probably a good idea to get all 5 concerti(all are indispensable), I would start with any of Wilhelm Kempf's recordings.  Also well worth the money are Murray Perahia's recordings, though he tends to take them all at a faster pace than I would prefer.

Oh, but how I loved Enzo.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo (a dog) tells what amounts to his master's life story.  Stein's attention to detail was amazing - the book read like it was written by somebody who took the time to stop and think \\"what would a dog feel/do in this situation?\\" As a result, Enzo is memorable and lovable.  He's at once a crotchety old man, and an innocent youth.  He's wise, he's naive, and he is devoted.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie to you, this book is very sad.  But it is also laugh out loud funny at times, and filled with love, devotion, philosophy and hopefulness.<br /><br />It's a beautiful book and definitely one of my favorites of the year.

We particularly liked the great detail the producers explained in how they achieved such realism in this EPIC production.  This is a ONE of a KIND movie.  They even show you how they did it!  Amazing and true dedication to their art.  Five Stars all the way.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|SHELTER has to be one of the best gay themed movies to date. None of the typical stereotypes that we normally see in movies. This is also more than a love story. It's a movie that shows how important family is. Great acting by all involved but the shining stars are Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe. Both do an outstanding job and pull you into the movie. The cinema photography is well done. If you only purchase one movie this year, make it SHELTER. It is one for the collection.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I've been an on-again off-again fan of REM's for awhile.  I liked their older stuff, kind of got turned off somewhere in the middle/ more recently, and only bought this because of an alleged \\"return to form\\".  Plus, it was only ten bucks (seriously, every cd should be ten bucks or less - they'd sell a lot more of them that way).     REM's newest \\"Accelerate\\" is really good.  It's definitely an older school REM record, which is a great thing.  I liked just about every song, which is more than I can say about a lot of albums today.  The faster songs definitely rocked, and the slower ones were really pretty/ beautiful.      I've always liked how REM has the ability to make music with some feeling behind it, some passion.  I definitely feel like this one succeeds in that aspect.  They didn't mail this one in.  My only complaint is that it's almost too short - it's over too fast - but that's better than just tossing in some filler material.  Overall I would recommend it if you're kind of iffy on buying it.

The vid cam (that was one excellent camera, and I want that battery!) film style added greatly to the suspense, and the acting was right on, realistic.  A solid movie with a somewhat predictable, but yet touching ending.  (Speilberg should take lessons from this film-making of scifi).

140120306X|5.0|To anyone familiar with the world of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (and I certainly do not mean the movie), this latest volume - The Black Dossier - will still manage to both surprise and delight. Set in a post Big Brother 1950's Britain, the story revolves around the aforementioned book which is taken from the vaults of British Intelligence and contains the history of the various incarnations of The League from its earliest beginnings to the post Martian Invasion adventures of Allan Quartermain and Mina Murray. Needless to say British Intelligence want the Dossier back....  To say any more would spoil what is an extremely enjoyable and exciting romp through a world populated with inumerable figures from literature of the time. As always Messrs Moore and O'Neill have created a world that is at once familiar yet somehow alien to us. The black humour and sense of reality in an an unreal world mean that once you enter into the story, you soon take things almost as a matter of historical record. All in all I can not praise this latest volume too highly - it has been worth the wait!   As a matter of caution, this book is only really suitable for an adult audience, but this should not put anyone off what is a true masterpiece of the graphic novel genre.
0345495004|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed reading \\"Loving Frank\\".  I have been a fan of his for years.  This book gave a different twist to the man I have always pictued.  In the book he seems more \\"human\\" and less arrogant in his relationship with Memah.  She is a very stong woman for her time making her a person who could stand up to someone like Frank.  I enjoyed reading about their everyday life in Wisconsin.
1591396190|4.0|The authors use the ocean metaphor to differentiate between the typical   strategic approach and the one that they advocate. The bloody red ocean is where the vast majority of companies thrash and battle furiously with their competition, adding incremental improvements to differentiate their   products/services. The blue ocean, as the subtitle suggests, describes an   uncontested market space that makes competition irrelevant. It is achieved through value-innovation - creating a leap in buyer value and reducing cost at the same time.     A variety of ways to create blue oceans are described in the book to include, reconstructing your market boundaries and reaching beyond existing demand. The authors provide easy-to-understand concepts and tools for taking your own organization through a strategic planning exercise.     The authors also acknowledge that even if you develop the most wonderful   strategy, implementing it can be quite difficult, so they provide pointers for helping bring about organizational change.    It is acknowledged that all blue oceans eventually become red. Tips are   provided to help determine the right time to start value innovating again, vs. riding out the blue ocean.     This is an important book. It's a value-innovation in its own right for assisting with strategic development and execution    Nick McCormick, Author, [[ASIN:0977981339 Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager]]

Kahney extrapolates from a variety of sources but he ultimately offers no special insight into how Steve Jobs thinks. His guesses about Jobs' thought process might be informed and even occasionally insightful but, at the end of the day, they're just guesses.    Rather than a glimpse of what's going on in Steve Jobs' brain, the reader is left with a glimpse of what goes on in the author's brain as he thinks about Steve Jobs. Not worthless by any means (the anecdotes are often entertaining) but definitely not what most readers are looking for.
006117758X|5.0|I read this book, and I loved it. It's from this novel that I had to read four or five more Bukowski novels, and I wasn't disappointed. This book is brilliance. I really loved it.
0307237702|5.0|A terrific, entertaining, and insightful book from start to finish. The chapters on \\"Faith\\" and \\"Politics\\" are particularly noteworthy but the entire book is well worth the reader's time.    Allow me to particularly recommend this book to those prospective readers who consider themselves Republicans. You will, I am confident, find that the real Senator Obama bears little resemblance to the liberal caricature that's promulgated in the media.    It is increasingly likely that Senator Obama will be the next president of the United States. When you read this book, I'm certain that you'll welcoming that eventuality.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|This is a great CD!  A lot of very good songs on the CD.
B00140PK6O|5.0|The town of Cranford is so full of life in this miniseries.  It is filled with wonderful characters played by amazing actors.  Even the minor characters have fully developed personalities and I was completing drawn into their world.  I laughed over and over and cried more than once.<br /><br />In the beginning, it feels as though Cranford is full of busy-bodies as they all strive to know each others' business.  But by the end it seemed that nearly every single character had been given a chance to do something special for a neighbor, and relished the opportunity.  This is a beautiful, heart-warming series you'll want to see again and again.
0143038419|2.0|big deal, a well-paid journalist from new york city gets a divorce and then gets a paycheck to go rent some houses, hang out in Italy and do yoga in Asia for a little while.  WHOOP-DE-DOO!<br /><br />sorry, i just don't see much heroic or adventurous in her endeavor, really, having traveled around the world for years on my own grit and survival skills - not a recurring paycheck from a huge magazine! it just kind of gets my goat that so many people find this story inspiring somehow... there are thousands upon thousands of far more inspirational people out there.<br /><br />the writer, however, is sometimes funny and entertaining - as she should be, as a paid professional.  it's a cute read, but in all seriousness, how this book got so popular is beyond me - must have been an AWESOME publicist!
B0017HL1CQ|5.0|I bought this product directly from W.A.S.T.E. while the regular album was being given away \\"for whatever price,\\" which I think dampened public interest in it.  I paid about $80 for it (40 pounds), and it was definitely worth the cost.  The book is interesting, it's photographs of what looks like paint splashes on a black background, obviously done with an artistic eye.  The vinyl is an excellent quality recording of the regular album.  The bonus album is great, it is NOT, I repeat, NOT just \\"extra tracks\\" from the main album.  I would characterize it as its own album, it has a flow and tempo and some excellent tracks, albeit just 8 tracks long.  Last Flowers and 4 Minute Warning are my two favorite songs, Mk 1 and Mk2 are instrumentals put in not as \\"filler\\" as some people have written, but to maintain the flow and mood of the album and I think do very well in that role.  I guess for the collectable nature of it, someone might pay $300 (as I see it advertised for sale), but as a piece of music, I would not have paid that much.  If you just want the LP, I can see it for sale on amazon now for $19.99.  As far as the bonus CD, I cannot find it on amazon or ebay, but I'm sure Radiohead will make it available at some point: it's not just a bonus EP, it's really like an entire album, and a pretty good one.  I would think they would allow their fans to own that at some point.      The link to wikipedia article on the album which includes a track listing of the bonus album is here: [...]    The track listing on the bonus cd is as follows:    1. \\"MK 1\\" - 1:04   2. \\"Down Is the New Up\\" - 4:59   3. \\"Go Slowly\\" - 3:48   4. \\"MK 2\\" - 0:53   5. \\"Last Flowers\\" - 4:27   6. \\"Up on the Ladder\\" - 4:17   7. \\"Bangers + Mash\\" - 3:20   8. \\"4 Minute Warning\\" - 4:06
B000SQJ27I|4.0|I love Manu Chao - though I must say that after living in Central America for a while on the traveler circuit I got a bit tired of hearing Clandestino, which seemed to be on perpetual play EVERYWHERE (meanwhile, he was touring the US for the first time - bummed I missed that!)  Manu Chao has managed to unite a people with his music and lyrics - it's truly unreal the effect he's had in Mexico and Central America. Still, on a purely musical note I hate to see him lumped into \\"world\\" or \\"protest\\" or \\"political\\" music because he's so much more than that, an innovative musician I hope won't make us wait so long next time - I've edited all my mp3s of his to file him under the genre \\"Unclassifiable\\" - because he is.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|As many others before me have stated, this show just keeps getting better and better. I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach when I read that the WB was considering cancelling the series, and I breathed a HUGE sigh of relief when I read just days later that Jensen & Jared were both signed for season 4 instead.     This show has it all: terrific characters, brilliant acting, fantastic writing, riveting plotlines... I can't wait until Season 3 comes out on DVD!
067003830X|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the most informative, intelligent, easy to understand and highly beneficial books I have ever read in my entire lifetime. The reviews summarize the important points, I can only add that you will be thankful from the very first moment you pick up this book and hold it in your hands until you read the very last word.
B0016CQCMQ|5.0|If you like the White Strips you will love these guys even more. Jack White is a real talent, but having other talents on board makes all the difference.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|This film had a great premise, but it was hampered - not by its small budget - but poor actor direction, and poorly-executed amateur-footage style. All in all, it could have been GREAT, but the resulting effort was just OK. I have 3 categories for motion pictures: 'film', 'movie', and 'flick'. This one was just a flick: expect crap and you might just be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The most striking thing about this movie, interestingly, is that it was reminescent of [[ASIN:B00006B1HI 9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition]], the documentary shot on September 11 in New York by the two French filmmaker brothers. In fact, I'm almost sure that the Cloverfield producers took more than a few cues from that film. Dust-covered people walking around in a daze, running for cover as a wall of dust and debris charges down through city streets, as well as that immediacy of being there and having the sudden realisation of something really, REALLY big going down.<br /><br />In fact, if you were disappointed by Cloverfield, I suggest watching the [[ASIN:B00006B1HI 9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition]] to see how capturing a major disaster on hand-held camera has actually been done before in real life.... WELL.
0380729407|5.0|This is Bradbury's finest novel, in my opinion.  All of Bradbury's fiction is lyrical in nature, but in this work his prose flows quickly and magically from the first page to the last.      The book is closer to horror than sci-fi, but I regard it as simply a great novel and believe that its universal theme of good vs. evil qualify it as literary fiction of the highest order.  It is a book I read every few years to remind me of what language is capable of doing and to listen to the voices of Bradbury's unique small town characters as they attempt to deal with the mystifying forces of Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Show, a traveling carnival.    The one-star reviews appear to be from the usual students who were forced to read the book.  Don't be deterred.  If you like a scary tale that also examines love and the human heart, you can't go wrong with SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.
B000026OW3|3.0|These impressions are based on very limited listening thus far but the performances seem to be very crisp and correct and devoid of schmaltz which surprised me. I think Chopin needs a bit more melodrama to be at its best.
0810994739|5.0|Not much grabs my son's attention.  This did.  It is a good read and it is very animated.  I can't wait to the remainder of the series comes out.  The first book was good but this is just as good and keeps my son entertained and laughing.  Reading is fun!
B00005JLR8|5.0|I watch it more than 10 times, my kids love it too. It makes me happy everytimes I watch it, to be satisfy  in what we are today. It teaches my son about money too. He feel he has to help me save and not to spend money in unnecessary things.  LOVE IT.....
B000XGDO04|5.0|Adele is not only a very good singer but she does away with the concept that women need to be blond and a size 2 to be a singer.  I LOVE this CD and I think she blows Amy Winehouse away!  If you're looking for a jazzy, soulful CD then this is the one.
0307265730|5.0|This author is a favorite of mine and she surely did not disappoint with this book.  She writes with such beautiful prose that there were times that I wanted to get a marker to underline some words that made a special impact on me.  She writes about families and generational issues with such sensitivity that no matter your ethnicity, you can relate.  I am in a book group and we read the book last month.  We all loved it.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
B000002UWF|5.0|How many effortless and affecting changes in tempo and rhythmn can one musician make? Louis Prima was the master. And he was a more accomplished man with a trumpet than Louis Armstrong ever hoped to be. On top of all that, when you set him beside Keely Smith, the combination is music magic. Get the music and listen. At first it may sound like \\"old timers\\" music; but stick with it, play it again, and like with great wine, you'll be rewarded after the draught has settled in your guts.
B0013FNC38|5.0|If you're going to buy one album this summer, it should be this one.  Mraz continues to make great music while infusing his sound with unexpected melodies and beats.  He's created an album that both young and older can appreciate and enjoy.    The album has a feel-good down to earth sound and is interesting, as well as unique, the whole way through.  Mraz has yet to disappoint through his quirky use of words and fresh take on living life while enjoying all the world's possibilities.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock.  I love this movie, bought it because its one I will watch over and over and over and over again.  If you like love stories this is one of the best, and guess what??  No sex, no screaming and cussing.  Hmmmm...made me like it even better!!!!!!!
B0014KD46W|5.0|I really like the sound.  It's relaxing and kinda jazzy.  I would say, \\"it's exactly what I would have expected\\".  The whole album reminds me of Low Spark of High Heeled Boys.  Although, Low Spark of High Heeled Boys still wins as my favorite.  If you like that song, I think you will like this album.    I say, \\"Buy it\\".
B000002VCQ|4.0|I have been anxious to listen to Whitney Houston's debut album for a long time; I am so happy I finally got around to listening to it because I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Here you will find the pop sound, the R&B, and a woman with a voice that is unmatched to this day.  No, not even Patti LaBelle or Minnie Riperton compare.  Whitney's voice hadn't completely matured on this album.  You will find her vocals at their most mature on her biggest song to date, \\"I Will Always Love You.\\"  But, she still sounds wonderful, almost angelic, on each and every song.  The production has that 80s sound to it, and this album is going to sound dated to some, but the quality of this album is simply undeniable.<br /><br /> Houston's first single is one of my all-time favorite songs by her and it is called \\"You Give Good Love.\\"  Everything about that song is superb, especially Houston's amazing delivery.  To steal a line from that song, her voice is \\"never too much, will never be.\\"  The people of the world obviously think that \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" is this album's finest jewel because it is always sung at graduations, church services and commencements.  \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" is lyrically the best song on this album because of the inspirational lines she sings just for the children.  \\"Thinking About You\\" and \\"Take Good Care of My Heart\\" are good offerings, but they sort of fall short when comparing them to the rest of this album.  \\"How Will I Know\\" was offered to Janet Jackson first, but she turned it down.  Houston took the song and made it all her own; you would never know that this song was written for someone else.  This song is kind of cheesy and very sappy, but it is definitely a guilty pleasure.  It has that 80s \\"American Bandstand\\" feel to it.  \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" is another one of her most definitive songs.  It is an R&B classic.<br /><br /> When I say that this album is essential for music lovers, I mean every word.  With this album, you will be taken on a journey to the mid 1980s and you will be enthralled from beginning to end.  A classic.  4 shining stars.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"You Give Good Love\\"<br />2. \\"Saving All My Love for You\\"<br />3. \\"How Will I Know\\"<br />4. \\"Greatest Love of All\\"<br />5. \\"All at Once\\"<br /><br />LOL, all of these songs were released to radio.to the mid 1980s and you will be enthralled from beginning to end.

B00007G1ZC|5.0|It's the most amazing Japanese film I've ever seen. And the quality of tape was really good - even I can say \\"perfect\\".
B000002UVX|5.0|I yield to no man when it comes to admiring Jimi Hendrix - indeed, watching and listening to him perform in a tiny club, way back in '67, was one of the highlights of my life.  It was transformational.  That said, let's be honest about Band of Gypsies - it's a mess.  Of course, the failures of Hendrix transcend the triumphs of mortals, but still.<br /><br />Hendrix freely admitted that he was no great singer, and his limitations have never been more evident.  Even Buddy Miles, who was better, sounds awful.  Perhaps the live concert environment meant they couldn't hear themselves.  Indeed, this album would have been much better had there been no vocals at all.  The jams, naturally, smoke like a southbound train, Hendrix is in great form.  But play the CD again and imagine how much better it would sound purely instrumental.<br /><br />Swapping out Mitch Mitchell for Buddy Miles was like trading in a Rolls Royce for a Yugo, Miles is particularly unexceptional here.  The bass contribution by Billy Cox could have been handled just as well by a table lamp.  Most egregious of all is the material itself.  From a song-writing point of view there is little to cheer, particularly when it comes to lyrics.  This would be more palatable if the singing were expert; unfortunately, the awkward vocals Hendrix delivers draw attention to the inadequacies of the lyrics.<br /><br />Of course it's worth owning and listening to, but, for a variety of reasons, it is just not up to the standards of the 3 \\"Experience\\" albums.
0307277887|3.0|Having seen the first season of the TV series before reading the book, it took away some of the suspense, but it was still a quick read, maybe too quick.    In Lindsay's book, Dexter is somewhat less charming to me than Michael C. Hall's portrayal.  Sure, the author continually reminds us through his protaganist that Dexter indeed conveys charm to all around him, while still living under the shadow of his \\"Dark Passenger\\".  Yet there's a real \\"American Psycho\\" feel to Dexter that comes across more strongly in the novel and can get a bit disturbing.  I know it's not supposed to be taken too seriously but the graphic detail gets to be a bit much.    Lindsay does his best to create the setting of a steamy Miami, with aggressive motorists, diverse neighborhoods and police department politics all intertwined.  The secondary characters are developed just enough, but in the TV series they are much more fully formed.    Maybe it's just me, but the Dexter novels, including this first one, wallow a bit too much in sadistic detail and not enough in the characters.  Despite that I found the book hard to put down and it moved along nicely.  Not sure if the subject matter qualifies as \\"light reading\\" though.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|I received the cd soon after ordering it.  I ordered it for my daughter's birthday.  The problem is I hid it so well that when her birthday came, i couldn't find it, so i had to buy another one.  Oh well, when i do find it, it's mine.  The cd is great, love Eddie Vedder.  There are only 11 songs and i wish there were more. Has American Indian and spiritual touch to it.  I recommend this cd.
0896760278|5.0|Janet Arnold is the premiere clothing historian of our day. The patterns in her books are based upon extant garments, out of storage and off the dead. Not only are details on the individual garments precise and extensive, but, patterns are provided for each garment within the book. With a little knowledge on drafting patterns can be sized to fit. Ms. Arnold provided information on the materials, colors and prints appropriate for each period and garment as well. Exceptional for the clothing historian or the obsessive compulsive stage costumer.
1400063515|1.0|There are some good points and some good perspectives in this book.  None-the-less it is so filled with bile, acrimony and failed research that I came out stupider for having read it.  The author makes up dozens of terms for things that already exist (e.g. \\"Silent Evidence\\" for what is commonly referred to as \\"Survivorship Bias\\"), rambles on for pages with personal diatribes and interjects fictional narratives as a truthful support for his points (one of which is that narratives are misleading).<br />There are better places to get the same information.  Books that are better researched, better written and less smug.  Read those instead.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|Though I prefer the older versions of this movie, \\"Last Man on Earth\\" and  \\"The Omega Man\\" I enjoyed watching this version for the updated effects.  The best part of the movie is the effects..seeing New York City abandoned  etc. They changed the story and victims a bit too.  I am probably being picky giving it three stars since it's a very good  science fiction movie if you never saw the previous two.  Will Smith is better than I would have guessed in this movie.
B00144VBBS|5.0|If you're a Toby Keith fan, this is a CD that you must have for your collection. 35 songs for this price can't be beat.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Bought this as a gift and suggested it to others because of the great price!  I was really impressed with the quality/price comparison.  Only problem, I should have bought one for myself!
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Cloverfield is an attempt to be either \\"cute\\" or \\"profound\\" and this movie can't make up its mind which, and eventually fails at both. It is definitely not cute to watch all these hideously boring twenty-somethings gossip about each other and play the \\"who's sleeping with whom\\" game and act as if it's the most profound thing anyone could imagine.<br />The party which opens the movie is a total bore and so are ALL the characters, most notably the dullard who plays Hud the accidental videographer who records the whole stinking movie on a handicam, very jerkily and with his snide comments and ridiculous rantings heard endlessly on voiceover.<br />It was a somewhat clever idea to put unknowns into the heart of the action without any explanation about this dinosaur-like monster who is invading Manhattan, but it doesn't add up to a sense of terror or show any uplifting aspects of any of the characters.<br />The one attempt at selflessness is instead foolishness and completely unbelievable. Rob gets a cell phone message from the girlfriend he's abandoned and who showed up at his party with an alternate date to spite him. Rob then defies all logic and heads back toward where Beth is apparently dying, just to prove he is, after all, a good guy who doesn't desert his ex-lovers.<br />It's just so much hogwash that viewers need a dose of mouthwash afterwards just to keep the bile from spilling over.<br />This movie shoud get NO stars, but there is some risk involved in making this kind of asinine nonsense and some of the special effects were reasonably good, but if you're looking for an \\"arty\\" or \\"thinking person's\\" horror or sci-fi, you'd be better off taking a nap and waiting for a daydream and avoiding this nightmare of a production.
B0012ITD3Y|5.0|What a wonderful collection of music from The Man In Black.  Some of my all-time favs are on this DVD.  For Johnny Cash fans, it's great!
0811826848|5.0|One of the best since Peter Brown's \\"The love you make\\",but has a lot of detail about the fab four as to their musical career and experiences in show business. I would read it again if i could. Good investment.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns n Roses are always the best.  I bought this as a replacement for a scrached up cd.
B000W91RUG|5.0|On the day of its debut, my boyfriend decided to check it out.  I am SO glad he did.  These guys are so funny that I look forward to Mondays.  We watch this show religiously.    If you are reading these reviews in an effort to make a decision on whether or not to buy the boxed set, BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was never a fun of the tv show.  I started to watch the reruns and loved it. My husband and I loved this movie and are looking forward for any other one on the way.  Some may not agree with me, but I thing the plot was totally cool and really believable, it ties it all together really nicely.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|Don't misjudge the picture quality and sound quality of this blu-ray title because it is a part action part romantic comedy. The technical aspect of this disk is top-notched. For PQ it has lots of pops in many scenes, for SQ this DTS-MA track is one of the best sound design and mixing for a blu-ray!
B000OYC7A8|4.0|Surely the best Floyd live item ever! The fact that Echoes is fully played is worth the money spent. And, on top of that, there's Wots.. from the lost treasure album Obscure by clouds (I wish there were more pieces from that album recorded live). Rick Wright is playing better than ever. The best was to find, amidst the bonus material, an acoustic version of Echoes (unfortunately not the complete piece, only the second part of it, but still a pleasant surprise). I just don't give it a 5-star rate because of the excess of stuff like High Hopes and the like. No doubts left on which one is Pink.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|2.5 stars.  Friends warned me that this film didn't exactly hold up to expectations, which is probably why I'm watching it a year later and, unfortunately, I have to agree with them.  My complaint is the same as others-too many villains, choppy character development and abrupt plot changes.  One scene Peter is begging for MJ to call him and literally 2 minutes later MJ is asking why he isn't returning HER calls.  Short memory loss, timely butler confessions and just flat out slow pacing-which is the death toll for an action flick.  Honestly, I think they need to stop here, disappear for about a decade and let another generation get a crack at it.  There's just no where to go from here.  There are already too many scenes that give a sense of deja vu.  I've never known so many people plummeting out buildings like they do in this franchise.  I'm not a New Yorker, but I doubt such a problem exists.  Overall, if you're a die hard fan, check it out.  If not, skip it.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Sorry, but the last time I watched something like this I walked away with a headache from all the \\"amateur\\" camera work and uneven dialog...and I'm being polite. As a college film project; an experiment, if you will, this would receive a passing grade. But to spend an absolute fortune on special effects and then waste it on deliberately bad cinematography, kind of made me sick. The forced dialog also felt about as realistic as the unlikely visit of the pissed-off space monster and its legion of nasty progeny. Nonetheless, I gave this film 3 stars because I actually liked some of the special effects work; the sound, the lighting, the creatures. They were quite good, actually, and particularly from a helicopter above Manhattan where the frat boys and their girlfriends watched the thing rip apart buildings. And speaking of the cast, the fact that they survived longer than any humans in any zombie movie I've ever seen had me rooting for the creatures. Endless creature attacks, helicopter crashes, bridge collapses, you name it. They just kept going and going and going...Anyway, by the end of the movie, I wanted to kill that idiot with the handicam. I prayed for just 5 minutes of smooth footage, but nooooooooo. And then it was over and I thought to myself what an idiot I was for spending a bunch of money on the DVD rather than downloading it for 4 bucks. Whatever, if you liked Blair Witch, you'll probably like this as well. At least you get a pretty cool creature with some attractive, and rather acrobatic, children.
B00000JNO1|5.0|I've been a diehard Skynyrd fan since this album was originally released and it remains my favorite of their entire body of work. This version sounds great and the bonus tracks are a super addition. On top of everything, the price can't be beat!
0440238609|4.0|I finished the trilogy recently and found it quite thought provoking but not necessarily in a complimentary way.  I found it quite intriguing that every good aspect of human behavior was attributed to those that fought against religion and every bad aspect of human behavior was ascribed to those that supported the church.  In particular, the church is portrayed as domineering, narrow minded, dictatorial, supportive of ignorance and violently supportive of itself.  He uses the Roman Catholic Church as the victim of his attacks but they could easily stand for all organized religion.  However, in Mr. Pullman's defense, he does start the trilogy with the statement that the church has fallen, the papacy is gone and the church is being run by a number of committees, boards and other governing bodies.  They are interested in maintaining their power and influence more than teaching righteousness and love for our neighbors.  Thus, from the beginning, Mr. Pullman has life turned upside down with the good people of the earth fighting against the tyranny of the religious organizations.    If that was what I saw in religion as a whole, I might be willing to join his rebellion but the fact of the matter is that religion is not all bad like he makes it out to be.  My faith embrasses every good gift and virtuous trait that he escribes to the rebels.  Thus, the trilogy's heroes utilize godly attributes and the trilogy's villains embody satanic attributes which is what every good story should do, but it unfortunately places those rolls on the social groups that they would not normally be ascribed to.  From a fantasy point of view, this is okay because we can enter the trilogy with the notion that society is upside down and antireligious rebellion is justified.    I could compose a much more lengthy comparison of the trilogy to my own beliefs but this is not the place for that.  Suffice it to say that Dust is nothing more than spirit matter that emanates from the presence of God and permeates all space, it is in and through all things.  The daemons represent our conscience or that part of us that helps us to know the difference between good and evil.  The alethiometer would be similar to the Liahona and represents revelation from God.    Of course Mr. Pullman has it all wrong when he attempts to talk about Adam, the Ancient of Days, and Enoch.  They were not egomaniacs but were humble followers of God.  God encourages education and knowledge.  No man can be saved in ignorance.  The glory of God is intelligence.  The Gospel encompasses all truth whereever it is found.  We are to learn wisdom out of the best books, learn by study, by faith and by prayer.  He who gains more knowledge and wisdom in this life shall have so much the advantage in the life to come.    If there is a fault in the churches of today, it is not God's fault, but the error of the people that claim to administer that Gospel.  Don't blame God for man's faults.  That is what Mr. Pullman does, and that is his first fatal flaw of logic.
B00102F5WK|1.0|SPOILERS AHEAD...    I didn't know what the movie was about before we bought it. My wife and I like Reese Witherspoon and have a passing interesting in Jake Gyllenhaal. We thought it was a thriller about a guy who disappears on a transatlantic flight, a cool premise for a movie. Granted, a guy disappears in this movie, but not while in flight. He's apprehended, under suspicion of terrorist activities, by the U.S. authorities and flown back to a country that employs torture to extract information.    On that level, Rendition is a thinly veiled anti-torture treatise. Nothing more. It's certainly not a well-crafted movie.    While we watched, we cringed at:    1. The snail's pace of virtually every scene,  2. The emotionally stifled acting,  3. The torture scenes  4. The confusing back-and-forth time jumps (think LOST without the clever writing and directing)  5. The confusing, way-too-many-characters-to-be-understood plot    There's really not much else to say about this movie. We could barely follow the story, and we had an extremely difficult time differentiating the actors -- or even caring about them. Jake's character was supposed to be tortured emotionally. Yet all he seemed is emotionless and dull-witted. Reese Withersoon's character was supposed to be tortured emotionally because she couldn't find her husband. Yet she only lost her cool in one scene. A very pregnant woman whose husband disappears would come unglued! Reese's character acted like her husband forgot to buy the potato chips for the afternoon BBQ. Mild irritation, rather than outright panic.    Too many subplots, characters, and settings made this movie a painful experience. My wife and I kept saying to each other, \\"No one would say that in this situation\\" or \\"No one would do that in those circumstances.\\"    In short, this movie was poorly written, sluggishly directed, and a total waste of our time.    In the end, two questions remained unanswered:    1. Was Reese's husband really guilty? The movieleft open the possibility th at the terrorist had indeed called him, and    2. Is torture justifiable if it's used to save lives?    The subject matter was handled so ham-fistedly that nothing was answered. And the characters were so black-and-white that (a) the good guys were bad for believing in torture, and (b) the bad guys were good for resorting to terrorism to combat the unfairness of torture.    Bottom line: If you watch Rendition, don't expect to be wowed by the acting (there really isn't any to speak of), or a cleverly written plot (nothing clever about this movie), or a well-balanced message that makes you think. This movie is a sludge hammer, not a scalpel. It's more apt to knock you unconscious than it is to awaken slumbering brain cells.    I can't recommend this movie at all, on any level. It's just a bad movie.
B000BX4D0E|4.0|The first part of the Radio Gnome Trilogy. Excellent spacey psychodelia from the top line up of this long-lasting band. There's one or two places it gets somewhat disjointed but overall, very entertaining and musically very dynamic and interesting.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|The saying by Robin Williams goes, \\"If you can remember the sixties you weren't really there.\\" This film tries to take us on a nostalgic trip down memory lane all with classic Beatles compositions functioning as a score. The main story revolves around Jude, and Lucy. Jude is from Liverpool England, works as a welder in a ship yard there. The opportunity arrives to go to the US and find his father that abandoned his mother after the Second World War not knowing that she was pregnant at the time. Jude finds his father working as a janitor at Princeton and meets Max, a spoiled rich kid who ditches classes, and delights in using the University's roof tops as his own personal driving range. Max invites Jude to his home for Thanksgiving where he meets Max's sister Lucy, and immediately falls head over heels in love with her. Max points out to jude that she has a boy friend who is in the Army, and Jude informs him that he too has a girl back in Liverpool that he's left behind. Jude tags along with Max down to greenwhich village after Max drops out of Princeton, and gets an apartment with him. Lucy comes down to visit them both after being informed of her boyfriends death in Vietnam. This pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the film where they meet an odd assortment of characters and try to figure out thier lives.    The story if not imaginative has a terrific boost given to it by the young cast who tear into it, and the music with passion. The musical numbers are stunning visually. The musical performances themselves are hit and miss at best, but they need to be given an A for effort. Dana Fuchs turns in some downright spirited performances with 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road', and 'Don't Bring Me Down' There are some surprise appearances by Bono, Joe Cocker, and Eddie Izzard who turn in some good readings of Beatle material themselves.   I was happy I didn't pay to see this in a theater. But, I do have to say that I'm happy to have it as part of my DVD collectionas well. It's not something that will be in heavy rotation along with the other rock flicks in my collection, but it will provide a pleasent diversion from time to time.    Just as a side note....I'm finally glad to see that someone attempted to tackle Beatles musioc in this type of theatrical vein again. This first time, Sgt Peppers was utterly disasterous. But with the arrival of this you can quietly slip the copy of that DVD into the rarely if ever played file.
B00006IU73|5.0|Though the absence of neo-classical solos and floofy synth leads will make some question its authenticity, \\"In Absentia\\" is a remarkable example of what progressive music should be. After moving from spacey, psychadelic jams to layered, hook-ridden rock songs, PT morphed again and created a haunting, epic masterpiece while ushering in a new, darker and more aggresive phase in PTs development. In short, \\"In Absentia\\" is mandatory listening for any fan of progressive music, both rock and metal.<br /><br />Lyrically, \\"In Absentia\\" tackles murder, molestation and mental illness, and the album's style reflects the fractured minds.  Here PT move from achingly beautiful clean and acoustic instrumentation to crackling, ominous electro-synth ambience to explosive metal, sometimes in a single track. Mastermind Steve Wilson's vocals, however, remain a constant, though he's equally schizophrenic, evoking vulnerability, rage and frightening indifference.<br /><br />Like most concept albums, \\"In Absentia\\" is quite lengthy, and sometimes dominated by instrumental passages. Unlike most prog, however, \\"In Absentia\\" is not an instrumental showcase. Wilson and company are surely talented musicians, they're content to leave the pyrotechnics to others. No, they display something better: extraordinary songwriting ability. Indeed, though some songs are better than others, there is nary an outright misstep here, a rarity in lengthier albums.<br /><br />Towards the open we have the nostalgic and wistful \\"Trains,\\" the most purely melodic track. Wilson's vocal are simply on, and the first run through the chorus always gets to me. \\"The Sound of Muzak\\" is a similarly commercial effort, but it's more off-kilter and profoundly bleak, with another insistent chorus. The middle of the album tends toward greater moodiness and less melodicism, and is dominated by the slow and spacey \\"Gravity Eyelids\\", and the pounding  instrumental \\"Wedding Nails.\\"  It's not as grabbing as some of the early material, but it all has an impact.<br /><br />PT saves much of the best for last 4 tracks.  \\"The Creator Has A Mastertape\\" and \\"Strip the Soul\\" play like a twisted pair. They're violent, disturbing tracks driven by an isolated bass and Wilson's affectless vocals, though \\"Creator\\" is concise with a nervous energy, while \\"Strip\\" is epic and moody. We're also treated to a couple gorgeous ballads.  \\"Heartattack In A Layby\\" is one of the most devastating songs I've heard. The prosaic, desperate lyrics and wall of harmonies and overdubs at the songs climax. . .the effect, I just can't hope to describe it. Simply a remarkable song.  The closer, \\"Collapse The Light Into Earth\\" is equally brilliant. It's mostly a few piano chords and a simple, melancholic melody. Eventually more harmony and variation are introduced, but it's this core that drives the song, creating an elegant coda to the album.<br /><br />In closing, \\"In Absentia\\" may not grab you immediately. Some will be disappointed by the lack of prog conventions, while others may not find the moodier sections impressive at first. Personally, I thought it was good, but not altogether great, on my first listen  Keep at it, though, and I think most open-minded prog fans will find something truly remarkable in this release.<br /><br />Check it out.act.

038533348X|4.0|This book is a strange prayer for peace.  Written in 1963, at the height of a country in the throes of nuclear paranoia, Russian Fear, Kennedy's assassination and increasing American interest in the land of Vietnam, it is easy to see why Vonnegut felt compelled to write this book.      He writes, \\" Perhaps when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs.  That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well oiled guns.\\"    This book is anti-war, anti-religion and anti- science, for it too, in the form of nuclear bombs and \\"Ice-9\\" will destroy the world as we know it.    From the books of Bokonon, a satirical send-up of Religious writings treated as the all-knowing word of god:  \\" Man blinked.  'What is the purpose of all this?'    'Everything must have a purpose?' asked god.  'Certainly,' said man.  'Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,' said God.    And he went away.\\"     I would recommend this to anyone who loved Slaughterhouse-Five, for this is how the author arrived at that great story.  An evolution of sorts, dealing with the same subject matter.      (Sidenote: Ice-Nine is the name The Grateful Dead chose as it's lyrical publishing company name.  Obviously this was a book on the shelves of many far-out kids throughout the 1960's.  Just thought I'd mention it.)
0452289963|3.0|This book is a difficult read.  There is some pretty heavy concepts in it.  Perhaps to some it may not seem that deep but to me it did.  I will have to read it again to get the full message the author is trying to convey.  It does have an intersting veiw however and I would think one could eleviate some stress in their life if they could just live in the here and now.  Deal with life moment to moment.
B0013HA838|4.0|This Production of Le Nozze di Figaro is, first and foremost, beautiful to watch.  The sets and costumes are lovely.  It is not set in 1787 (or whenever Mozart wrote it) but rather in the early 1800s.  (Think somewhere between Jane Austen and Charles Dickens).  However, it is old enough for those who, like myself, dislike modern looking opera productions.  The cast is also lovely.  I am sure I am not the only woman who thinks Erwin Schrott is a gorgeous Figaro and Gerald Finley is a very nice looking count.  Susanna and the Countess are also nice looking--they look their parts.  I'm sure this is very surfacy, and not worthy of an opera fanatic, but I am unashamed to say that I have trouble \\"getting into\\" a production of Le Nozze with, for example, a very heavy or old-looking Susanna.  Maybe my imagination is not powerful enough.  In any case, the singers' good looks corresponded with the beauty of the set.    The reason I gave this only four stars is that I was not blown away by the singing.  I thought that Erwin Schrott and Gerald Finley were both excellent when they sang. (I hope that is not influenced by my eyes...but one can never tell for sure)  Schrott's voice is very creamy.  I can see why is is known as an excellent Don Giovanni.  Finley has a very powerful, clear voice.  He acts with his voice just as much as with his body, and it was so nice to really hear the bass notes in the ensembles.  I did find Schrott's recitative to be slightly irritating.  He was very expressive, which is the most important thing in recitative, but he could be a little too free with the notes, even to my taste.  What he did was rather strange, and hard to describe:  I suppose you would just have to hear it, but he would drop into very low speech.  To me, it actually sounded like someone speaking Spanish...but that really is just a quibble.      Miah Persson has a lovely voice, but not exactly what I imagine for a Susanna--not light enough.  That is a matter of opinion, though.  Her singing itself was wonderful.    I cannot say that I was as pleased with Dorothea Roschmann.  I saw her live once, and loved her.  But at least in this production I thought she sounded a bit shrill for most of the time.  In the trio \\"Susanna or via, sortite\\" when the Countess sings \\"schiviam per carità\\" Roschmann squeaked out the highest note very abruptly both times, and I couldn't even tell if she meant to or not.  I did not like it either way.    Cherubino was fine, the singer looked the part, but I have never really liked a Cherubino since I heard Frederica von Stade.      The other principle singers were adequate.  I was not blown away by any of their performances, but I am not very critical of those parts.  They certainly acted very well (another visual!).    The very worst problem with this DVD is that the balance between the singers and the orchestra is bad during large ensembles.   I had a lot of trouble hearing the singers.  I have no idea as to whether this is due to the DVD editing, or the production itself.    So, I have given this four stars.  I bought it after watching it on TV, so I do love it.  I think it is a beautiful, and overall well-sung production.  Howover, I am reserving my five star rating for an ideal Figaro.  This is wonderful and highly recommended, but not yet the best.
0321525655|5.0|Very high quality teaching material on how to prepare and deliver presentations.  Simple, readable, and well illustrated, it doesn't contain a single unnecessary word or image.  It was enjoyable enough to read through in my spare moments in a day and come away feeling refreshed and creatively inspired.
B00006CXXU|3.0|As a singer I use Christina's material for my vocals.  I don't love her music through and through but adore the song's Beautiful, Ain't no other man, Hurt and Candyman but all the other filler music is not usable for me and my vocals.  Christina has a very sharp voice.  It might do her best to do some more soft to the ear stuff but who am I?  She still is an awesome singer though! This album only has one decent song, thats why I think I got it so cheap on Amazon.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I started watching band of brothers before I left the united states at a friends house.  I woke up one moring made some coffee and sat down to watch a war/film that ended up being an adventure.  As soon as I got to my next assigment over seas it was the first thing I purchased from amazon and I waited home very impatiently till it came in, a week later!  Very fast.  I don't want to talk about episodes in the series because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is interested in seeing it.  All I want to say is if you get through the entire collection and the series doesn't inpire you to become a better person or fills you with pride then there is something definitly wrong with you.  Highly entertaining and a must see for WWII buffs, or not, alike. I would recommend this collection to anyone even the French HAHA j/k.
B00005QIPH|2.0|The album is great.  The product from Amazon came with a crack in the case - not impressed.
B00133KFGW|3.0|Movie gets high marks.  The only negative aspect was Robin Williams role.  He was miscast.  The rest of the actors did well, mainly Hightower.  Would have had the boys parents with him as the movie should have con't on showing  them together as a family.  Liked the music and the overall feel of the movie. Above average family feature.  We need more PG than PG-13 rated titles.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />This really is a classic film, if not a work of deep genius. Murray is as good as he gets, pretty much (though he was often that good in this era---Scrooged, Quick Change, What About Bob?); the script is tight and the premise is brilliant; Andie is at her least annoying; and above all GD is funny as hell at many points.<br />Worth rewatching every few years and/or whenever you need a feel-good romantic comedy.
B00000JZXJ|5.0|You talk about the blues, the legend of Robert Johnson always comes to mind... the legendary singer/songwriter from the past was a one man guitar machine, he sang and wrote the blues like nobody else's business. There was something mystical about Robert Johnson, listening to his recordings is to know - Charlie Patton and Sonhouse knew him before his hidden talent was revealed. Robert was just a young kid trying to play the harmonica, barely able to play a single note on the guitar, of course Patton and Sonhouse were already established bluesman and superstars of the time. Sonhouse once said of Johnson \\"Robert disappeared for a long while, probably absorbing his music education, then all of a sudden, one dark cloudy day Mr. Johnson came back to town a different man, something different in his eyes, most of all Robert Johnson was a brand new guitar player\\", hence the beginning of a blues legend. We can hear this great legend on this imported cd from the UK  \\"prism leisure\\" with all 29 songs on one disc, the audio is surprisingly good, better, if not louder in comparison to the 1990 Columbia box set. This compilation 1936-1937 is a straight run through Johnson's short and productive career with no alternate takes, featuring the ingenious blues of Robert Johnson.
B000GIW43M|4.0|I agree that it is a little difficult to keep up with the characters, but it begins to get better in the second half. It is a good book, focusing on mother daughter relationships that I'm sure most can relate to. I recommend!
0670018651|5.0|Let me explain.  When the JOS came out, (no pun intended) It was like a nice pictorial guide for the uninitiated, and a refresher for those who had perhaps been thrown into the water without lessons.    That's what Perfumes: The Guide is like, but it's funny too.  The talent that both Turin and Sanchez have is the ability to not merely describe the source scent (lemon, incense, musk) but put character and location to it.  For those of us who have a secret closet of 100's of scents, this is delightful and insightful and great fun.  I actually giggled my way through the section on the 'Clean' line, having found the very same results.    More that that these two authors are also appreciative art collectors.  One can admire and be completely awed by a 17th century painting that began a genre' and was ahead of it's time without wanting it hanging on one's wall.  The same can be said for a fragrance.  I can hate the actual smell and wouldn't put it on a rodent but absolutely admire the composition and art of it. (Angel, Angel, Angel)    And just like JOS, maybe there are some new things you might want to try, and maybe there are some things that are just entertaining to, er, hear about.    I enjoyed the book as a fun and humorous guide through the world of fragrance, but it isn't the end all word.  There are several other excellent books that go into the history and producing of fragrance as well.  All of which make fabulous reading for the novice or officially obsessed.    And just like JOS, there are special shops to get supplies, online and off, and they don't have to be in brown paper bags.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30 day shred is a great workout.  I began seeing results within 2 weeks. I would highly recommend purchasing this workout dvd.
0393312836|5.0|After trudging through the first couple of pages, readers may wish to throw the book across the room.  DO NOT DO THAT! For you would be engaging in a personal disservice.  You shall read on, and you shall learn the lingo.  This book is vivid, cruel, and evocative.  I had to read this book more slowly than others.  Probably because of the bizarre syntax.  However, after short spells of putting the book down, I could hardly wait to pick it up again.  This is a truly monumental work.
B00125WAXC|5.0|This is the type of story we need more of. True life experiences from our past. In 1935, Melvin B. Tolson(Denzel Washington)had a vision for the debate team of small black Wiley College, in Marshall, Texas. Groundbreaking for that time, the definitive opportunity for white America to see just how well African-Americans could compete; even on par with themselves when given a chance, and when they put their minds to it. Even being invited to debate Harvard, and winning. And that winning streak lasted for 10 years without defeat. Along with Mr. Washington's astounding performance, the rest of the cast is just as magnificent. But what impressed me most about this film, is the direction of Mr. Washington. Superb!!! He has reached a brand new pinnacle in this area. A film that I consider one of the very best of 2007, and just about any other year as well. If you want to inspire your over 12 children to greater heights, this is the film to do it. What a remarkable viewing experience!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|They're back and they're at their best.  In my opinion, there's not a bad number on this CD.  They've tightened their playing and gotten Jacknife Lee, the producer of U2 fame, to help them out.      \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" first got everyone's attention. It's a strong lead-up single that got people's attention.  From the first song, \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge,\\" to the closer, \\"I'm Gonna DJ,\\" the group proves they're back rocking and hopefully will have more to come.     My favorites, \\"Mr. Richards,\\" the deceptively soft opening, \\"Hollow Man\\", \\"Houston\\", and the final cut, \\"I'm Gonna DJ,\\" which talks about the eternal nature of music:    Death is pretty final  I'm collecting vinyl  I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world    My only gripe is that at 11 songs and 34.5 minutes, this is a short CD.  I would have appreciated a couple more songs. Despite that, it's still a 5 star CD.  Just can't find a song that's not worth repeating!     Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B000XPU5NY|4.0|The CD to me was a souvenir to the fans of this tour.     Having seen Phil solo and with Genesis, I can tell that the audiences are very different. The solo Phil fans going to a Genesis show are probably going to be bored until they do \\"the hits\\". Which they did.     The one thing missing from the CD, the HUGE screen. I don't think the solo translates to CD as well as watching Phil and Chester play it, you can find it on You Tube for the time being.       Keep in mind, it wasn't that long ago that Phil said he was done playing live shows because of his hearing. So for the past 2 tours, it's been about putting closure with the fans while he can still play good enough and sing just enough before age puts limits on him.     Other than a possible Rock Hall induction and Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett agreeing to tour (and you can bet if it does happen, Phil and Peter will be exchanging lead vocals just because it would be hard for PG to sing some of those challenging songs) this is going to be it as far as they go.     This tour had no opening act. It was just them for 3 hours with a short break.     There's enough documented on them live (other than the Lamb tour) to see and hear them over the years and get that they were and still are a great live band, but you will be pleasantly surprised that most of it is as good as anything they've done in the past 30 years and believe it or not, some of the excellent drum playing is Phil and not Chester covering. It's not \\"Seconds Out\\" or \\"Three Sides Live\\", but to me it's on par with \\"The Way We Walk\\".
B00133KFGW|1.0|I didn't really want to watch this movie to begin with, and sure enough, it was horrible.  First of all, I believe the child was insane.  It's basically a twisted musical version of Oliver Twist. It's one of the strangest musical movies ever! something I care nothing about. It was infuriating how the boy kept missing his parents by just a little. Also, NOT RECCOMENDED FOR SMALLER CHILDREN, his \\"parents\\" got him doing something well, um,.........sexual. Half the movie was flash-backs and I do think they did them well, It's sooo easy to make flashbacks confusing.   All, in all, strange dumb movie; do not listen to all the other 5 star reviews, I hated it.
0143038419|5.0|Liz Gilbert almost got me. As she starts her Italian adventure I was preparing myself for a pulpy read with easy (and possibly undeserved) laughs. And before that, the Amazon reviews almost scared me away. Boy, what a mistake that'd be! This is a spiritual book in the true sense of the word. Although I kept laughing throughout the book, its simplicity is deceptive. Between the lines, Gilbert is about  so much more:  vitality,  coming into one's own, creating reality and  matching the soul's aspirations to the delicious unpredictability of life.<br /><br /> After divorcing her husband (who is portrayed rather unflatteringly as a greedy and vindictive sob) the author decamps for the fountains of Rome where she makes great friends, samples excellent food and learns about the pleasure of dolce far niente from the world's masters in this important art. Here is a quote from Liz's book on why Italy, which has produced some of the greatest artistic, political and scientific minds of all ages, has never become a major world power:  The Italian history of corruption by local leaders (a la Mussolini and Berlusconi) and exploitation by foreign dominators [France, Austria, Spain etc]<br /><br />\\"has led Italians to draw the seemingly accurate conclusion that nobody and nothing in this world can be trusted. Because the world is so corrupted and unfair, one should trust only what one can experience with one's one senses, and THIS makes senses stronger in Italy than anywhere in Europe. This is why Italians will tolerate hideously incompetent generals, presidents, tyrants, professors, journalists and captains of industry but will never tolerate incompetent opera singers, conductors, ballerinas, courtesans, actors, cooks and tailors. Sometimes only beauty can be trusted. Only artistic excellence is incorruptible. Pleasure cannot be bargained down. And sometimes the meal is the only currency that is real.\\"<br /><br />This book is essentially revolving about beauty - of friendship, inner life, good taste (and food) and, not least, the ever elusive bounty that is bestowed by a life that is lived well.<br /><br />In India Liz stays in a celebrity ashram north of Bombay where she has a couple of transcendent experiences whereas in Bali she befriends locals in the beautiful town of Ubud. In fact, her capacity for friendship - the genius of it - together with the honest and unflinching ability to face herself is something that I found very cool. So what if she has bad taste when it comes to men? To me, her naivete in all things male is simply a (n attractive) measure of her femininity and humanness. In any case, Liz's description of finding her inner strength is better than those of most self-styled guru and self-help \\"authority\\" out there, including by the controversial Gurumayi herself.<br /><br />As I started to write my review in here i was kinda surprised (actually i wasn;t surprised at all) how violently some people react to the book. There is some real vitriol here, doubtlessly reflecting the (very real) American horror of idleness and pleasure, of decoupling from the \\"productive\\" life of the hive. There seem to be many, oh so many, envious and unfulfilled divorcees out there. To me it seems that many reviewers can't decide whether they are more insulted by Liz's snub of Puritan ethics or her hedonic streak, glamor (the bit of it that seeps between the lines) and courage to end a suffocating marriage. I imagine the very idea of spending a year \\"finding oneself\\" is anathema to the hard working hoi polloi. Yet - what else matters in this vale of tears?<br /><br />  A second set of reviewers is responding with a weary \\"been there done that\\" (lived amongst the Afghans and the Okies, spent time in ashrams, etc, haha) - never realizing that is the *spirit* of the author, her natural inclination to befriend her fellow humans and not to be better than they are, that represents a main draw of the book.<br /><br /> Is it true that one can live one's lifein an ever expanding circle of vitality and joy? Liz Gilbert gives us a resounding YES. So what if she was paid to write about herself - this is what travel writers do for living. Having had my share of humbling and uplifting experiences I know for sure that she is not faking anything - her spiritual insights are the real deal. In my mind, she provides us with a XXI century (US) version of Lawrence Durrell's travelogues - only more light-hearted, self-deprecating and courageous.  Bravissima!?

0316001821|4.0|This book, The Lovely Bones, takes the climax of any book and puts it in the very first chapter. It can be said that this would ruin the rest of the book, but it keeps a reader's attention through the book, looking at the lives of the Salmon family.<br /><br />In the very beginning of the book Susie Salmon, the main character, is killed by a neighbor, Mr. Harvey. No one knows that he did it because he is such a quiet neighbor, and one would suspect him. The police try to comfort the family by solving the murder, but little evidence is found. The family is left with unanswered questions but must remain living their lives. Eventually Mrs. Salmon, Susie's mother, leaves because she cannot handle her life anymore. Susie's sister, Lindsey, grows up and Susie is up in Heaven watching down on her family. Susie does get the chance to come back down to earth, and she does for just a few minutes to get her last wishes fufilled. With this, the entire Salmon family, including Susie, learns to move on.<br /><br />This book could be considered a \\"girl\\" book because it has a lot of emotions of the family while they grieve over the loss of their daughter or sister, and that is not usually a subject that most \\"guy\\" books include. This book captures a reader's interest, as a journey is taken by the Salmon family, and a different journey by Susie who is in Heaven. Lastly, this book is a fast read because once readers start reading, they are hooked on everything the family is, like hoping the killer, Mr. Harvey, will be caught.<br /><br />In conclusion I recommend this book to others who want to look at a murder mystery from a different point of view, from the perspective of the victim in Heaven, rather than those still on Earth. This book will capture a reader's attention and take it on a ride through the life of the Salmon family.<br /><br />Heather Miller

B0013FBS20|1.0|- with Charlton Heston in New York City, driving through the empty streets of New York city during the day and fighting to stay alive at night. In this movie Will Smith spends his days driving around the streets of New York scavenging for food, but spends the nights lockdown in the house he shared with his family (becasue the freaks can only come out at night). Not a family movie at all, my wife could not be in the same room with my 17 year old son and I while we were watching it.  Not a movie I will keep in my blu-ray collection.
0375847227|5.0|I wasn't going to post a review of `His Dark Materials' (HDM) because there are so many already. This was my second reading of HDM and I liked even more the second time. But after reading some of the positive and negative reviews I felt as if I could add something to the discussion on three issues and add some comments of my own on Pullman's apparent themes. Two of these issues are, in my opinion, trivial and the third might be, but it is interesting nonetheless.    If you look on Amazon or blogs or other book review sites you will see both positive and negative comparisons of HDM to `Lord of the Rings' (LOR). This is one of the trivial issues: HDM has no relationship whatsoever to LOR other than both are long books broken into three parts and are the basis for some pretty good movies.    The second of these trivial issues are the positive and negative comparisons to the `Harry Potter' series (HP). The HP series are mostly for and about children and are about magic as in `Hocus Pocus' magic. HDM is about children but I would hesitate to say that Pullman wrote it for children. Pullman in interviews has said that he dislikes the label of `children's literature' as it implies `not for adults.' The themes in HDM are very adult, but I suspect that an intelligent young adult would respond to them and the adventure aspects of HDM would appeal to most younger readers as well. More over HDM is not about magic at all; it is science fiction (a genre Pullman also dislikes) in the best sense. The so-called `magic' is merely what someone might call the physics of alternate Universes.    The last issue, and it may or may not be trivial, is the objection to HDM by Christians. There is no doubt that Pullman intended HDM to be a counterbalance to C.S. Lewis's slobbering exaltation of Christianity (and the superiority of male Anglo-Saxons) in `The Chronicles of Narnia' (CON) and in general a condemnation of some of the practices the Catholic Church. However most of the criticism you see about HDM seems to come from the politically conservative Christian right that interprets any and all criticism of religion as profanation of Christianity in general. I would add that there are also positive reviews of HDM solely on the basis of being anti-religion as well.    I do find it interesting that some of the negative reviews of HDM by Christians are really very long and well written. It makes me wonder why someone would say that HDM was a not a good book when it obviously stimulated them to write several pages on it. I suppose that it upset them and they don't like to be upset by what they read. That is strange as it is one of the points Pullman makes in HDM. In passing he mentions that the church has imprisoned a scientist for coming up with what seems to be a valid description of multiple dimensions in String Theory. These negative reviews seem to follow a general trend on the Internet of a group of Christians who spend a lot of time sniffing out heterodoxy and attempting to stifle it.    My last observation is why I think HDM is exception SciFi and why you should read it and get your kids to read it as well. What Pullman has done is to take the implications of String Theory, Chaos Theory, the theories about Dark Matter and Dark Energy in modern theoretical physics and asks the question of what a world would look like if these theories were true. What if there are other Universes and what would happen if we could travel between them? This is really, really interesting and I think Pullman has done an exceptional job here. The fact that he uses the influence of religion as one vehicle may or may not have been a major issue here, but it does not detract in any way from the fascinating SciFi aspects of this book.    You can read this in three parts as it was published, but like LOR it is best considered as a whole work. HDM is available in a number of editions and I read, this time, the omnibus of all three volumes. If you don't know anything about modernphysics it will not detract from the enjoyment of the book as just SciFi or fantasy.

B00004BZ16|3.0|To understand why this album is such a bloated mess, read _Last Gang in Town_ by Marcus Gray. Basically, the Clash wanted to stick it to their record company and reward their fans by releasing 3 LPs for the price of one. Unfortunately, the single LP price only applied in the UK; those of us in the US paid top whack. Even more unfortunately, the band didn't have enough decent material to fill out all three LPs, so they wound up scraping the bottom of the barrel. Which was a pity, because there is some very good music in here, but it is obscured by the crap.<br /><br />The other thing you have to understand is that the Clash had a hard time writing singles. All their famous tunes were afterthoughts. _Sandinista_ in particular suffers in this respect. \\"Magnificent Seven\\" was released as the single, but it's about as catchy as ... a forgettable tune. If _Sandinista_ had one or two good singles, its reputation would be vastly enhanced. (_Combat Rock_ is a much worse album than _Sandinista_, but is not nearly as reviled because it had a couple of good singles.) So, all the good tracks on _Sandinista_ are 'album tracks', i.e., not singles, which is to say they aren't necessarily tunes that you'll find yourself humming. But listen to \\"The Street Parade\\", for example, and tell me it doesn't stick in your head.<br /><br />Here are the good tracks:<br /><br />105. The Leader<br />110. Somebody Got Murdered<br />111. One More Time<br />112. One More Dub<br />113. Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice) (edit)<br />114. Up In Heaven (Not Only Here)<br />115. Corner Soul<br />116.

Version City (edit)<br /><br />Those marked 'edit' will benefit from having their beginnings or endings truncated in your favorite music editing software.<br /><br />If you're going to burn these to disc, include \\"Rock The Casbah\\"<br />and \\"Should I Stay Or Should I Go\\" from the otherwise miserable _Combat Rock_ as your singles, et voila: the lost Clash album!r singles, et voila: the lost Clash album!
0679746323|1.0|I dont like Mao, even hate him.    But, reading this book makes me disappointed - I found that the way the book is made follows very Mao' style as described by the authors themselves.    Some history facts are completely black-white overturned, for example,   1. the india-china war: please refer to Mr. Neville Maxwell's India's              China War.    2. the writer stated: Mao summoned his former wife, which deteriorated         her metal illness.         The fact is that, someone else revealed Mao's whereabouts to her         because of sympathy. And Mao punished the man just because of     this. It is clear that there is no reason for Mao to make such an appointment, can not be more inscrutable.     3. the nuclear weapons:        why make the promise that China will not use it first? isnt it completely defensive?        Then the authors' fiction on Mao's nuclear ambition is not justfiable.           The authors' bias, and efforts of pulling everything evil and        making everything evil about Mao can be sensed sadly here. (Not sad for Mao, but for such a kind of writing.)      What to say? Read more - this is my sincere advice.
B0012YYZYU|5.0|If you are a Led Zeppelin fan, this is a must have for your collection. The transfer to hi-def is excellent, much better than I expected for a 32 year old film. And the remastered sound (from stereo to 5.1) is also excellent. This is one dvd that is worth watching all the extras as well. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who appreciates the music of Led Zeppelin.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's such a pleasure to review this album after Hard Candy came out. 'Confessions' speaks so much about the time Madonna went through after American Life and delivers as an uplifting CD as Like a Prayer did in the eighties. The lyrics my be straight-forward, but they are truly deep and meaningful. I think the best proof about this would be 'Jump', a song about overcoming your fears and soaring to new heights, being it professional or emotional issues.<br />The closing track is an amazing way to end such a brilliant album. Like or Not is one of the sexiest and most confrontational songs ever done by Lady Ciccone. I love this in-your-face statement better than American Life (song) as it seems so cynical and sincere.<br />Even though 'Confessions' is addressed to the dancing floor, it still holds sing-along appeal, which is one of the things we love so much about pop.<br />And it's a great album to go with your work out. Ha!

0143038419|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is very explicitly a prepaid writer's journey for an entire year where she tries to heal from a painful divorce. She has no children, and her job IS to fly around the world writing about things. It is important to understand this up front. I find that people either love this book or hate it, and often their feelings revolve around this one fact. Detractors feel she is \\"spoiled\\" for going off to Italy, India and Indonesia to be on her own. That is what she does! Ths is her job. It is like complaining that Steve Irwin jetted around playing with animals, and did this on his vacations too. If someone has this as their normal lifestyle, and they are actively paid for this, then being jealous or upset that they live this way seems unreasonable. We are hearing notes from a person who DOES live this way. It would be the same as picking up Steve Irwin's book about going around and interacting with animals. To complain that he should have stayed at home makes no sense. It is not who he is. It is not who Elizabeth is.<br /><br />So, that being said and understood, let's look into this year. It's always easy to throw stones at other peoples' lives. As has been said many times, those who live in glass houses should avoid stones - and he who has no sin should throw first. All of us have made mistakes. All of us have regrets. Elizabeth has ended up in a marriage with serious faults. She does not describe the issues - which I greatly respect! Many women would have turned this type of book into a vent-fest where they skewered their ex. If anything, Elizabeth makes much of her husband's patience and doesn't go into his faults. To complain about her tact in this area seems petty.<br /><br />Elizabeth honestly doesn't want kids. That is fine! Only people who REALLY want kids should have them. A look at the child abuse statistics bears this out. So for whatever reasons - mostly unmentioned - she and her husband break up. As a result, she spirals into a deep depression and is at the point of suicide. She is seeing a therapist and it is not helping. She is on medication. It also does not help.<br /><br />So finally she formulates a plan to get away. Remember, this is a woman who does travel writing *for a living*. It is not an abnormal thing for her. She loves the Italian language. She loves yoga. She had met a medicine man in Indonesia. So she gathers her things and heads out.<br /><br />Italy - land of long, leisurely walks, of delicious comfort food, of a friendly openness. I know many people who ADORE Italy and return there frequently. Yes, it is a land of fiery emotions, and some people live in poverty. You can find similar conditions in most countries. She begins her stay here sickly and worn down. Slowly she begins to repair her physical health and starts to make connections with others. She begins to explore a little and find pleasures in the basics of life.<br /><br />Next, India is where she explicitly goes to an Ashram (retreat) to study yoga and medication. People who are interested in yoga very often do this. Again, to complain that she doesn't \\"see outsiders\\" when she is at a yoga retreat seems baffling to me. The purpose of going to a retreat is to rebuild your own spirituality. It is only then that you can help others. When they tell you in an airplane to put on your own oxygen mask before you help a child, it's not because they're callous. It's because otherwise you both could die. She slowly learns how to deal with \\"monkey mind\\" - a VERY common issue with westerners who meditate, who cannot get their mind to let go of their worries. It is only after several months that she can meditate without strong negative, painful emotion.<br /><br />Finally, Indonesia is where she learns about balance. She gets a sense of how people work in a community, how they support each other, how they heal the physical and mental and spiritual together.<br /><br />Now, I have phrased this review a bit \\"defensively\\" because I really thinksome of the people who \\"hate\\" this book do so because they think it is wasteful for a person to spend a year \\"taking care of themselves\\". They feel a depressed writer should just ignore the depression and do ... what? Open a kindergarten? Elizabeth WAS a travel writer. If she had just \\"gone back to work\\" she would have been doing something very similar. A past job had been to go to Indonesia to write about yoga for several weeks. Is it really any \\"worse\\" that she went to India to write about yoga for several months? She was after all paid in both cases to do exactly what she did. The only real difference is that with this book part of the criteria of what she wrote was to include her personal feelings, which if anything is far more difficult (and risky).<br /><br />Some people have an issue that she HAD serious depression. Is this going to turn into a Tom Cruise rant on how women should not be depressed or affected by changes in their lives? Many women DO get serious depression and are told to just \\"deal with it\\". Depression is an extremely serious medical issue and should never be dismissed or ignored. Elizabeth was on medication, she had a therapist. If a \\"change of scenery\\" was key to helping her recover, then that is fine - and quite normal. For people who say \\"well my life sucked worse and I dealt with it\\" - again, perhaps those people do not understand what depression is caused by or how it works. It is demeaning to people who do have serious depression to say \\"just get over it\\" or \\"I don't think your life warrants depression, so you don't have it.\\"<br /><br />If you completely ignore the content, I think Elizabeth's writing style was brilliant. I downloaded a sample 20 pages on my Kindle and was laughing out loud at several statements in the book. I promptly went and bought the entire thing. There were many, many sections in the book where her descriptions were vivid, her dialogue was crisp, her observations were right on. I love her writing style.<br /><br />Now that all being said, I do not say that this book is flawless. In a way it is like reading Valerie Bertinelli's book. Both women are open about their mistakes. Neither woman is perfect. Elizabeth takes on a lover before her marriage is dissolved. Certainly this is something men AND women have been doing for centuries, but it is not a wonderful choice. Being a planner-type myself, I found Elizabeth's way of just randomly launching into travel without knowing what she's doing rather disconcerting. She gets to Indonesia with no idea of where she is going or how to get there. Also, some aspects about the ending of the story bother me, but I do not want to give anything away.<br /><br />While others found her self introspection to be too much, I found it normal for a memoir. If you're writing a memoir, you are by definition writing about yourself. People read your story to learn how you felt and thought - and it SHOULD be different from how they would think! If we all just read about \\"our own thoughts\\" the world would be a boring place. It is important to learn and grow and understand how people different from ourselves interact with the world.<br /><br />I think it is very difficult for Americans in particular to \\"let go\\" of a hectic pace. In Europe people routinely take vacations of a month or more. In the US, people race away for a weekend, and bring their laptops with them. They have kids and then pile their schedules full of karate lessons, soccer games and play dates - when more and more studies say that kids (and adults!!) need quiet time to just \\"be free\\". I honestly think we all COULD use an entire year off from our current life, to spend time on our own, away from our stress and schedule. Look at many cultures were people live a far more relaxed, easy way. Often they have far less rates of cancer, diabetes, heart attacks and other issues. Stress and cortisol are causing modern people huge health issues.<br /><br />So to summarize, I think part of why this book is so popular is that it draws out such strong feelings in people. Readers feel jealous of Elizabeth's ability to travel. They feel upset that Elizabeth \\"wastes\\" a year traveling without feeling \\"guilty\\" about not volunteering at a nursing home instead. They feel annoyed that Elizabeth's personal memoir talks about her personal feelings rather than writing a social treatise on poverty in the slums of India (which she wasn't near). They feel morally upset that she left her marriage without laying out in explicit detail for public review why the marriage failed. They feel an ovarian outrage against any female would not actively leap at the chance to bear children. They feel religious fervor at anybody who would approach the worship of God without going specifically through a priest and Jesus Christ. Whatever was the trigger for someone, I think that trigger is an important idea to meditate on - because there are MANY people who feel the way that created that trigger. To be able to try to understand them in this no-holds-barred book is incredibly valuable. If your decision is to just close the book and turn your back, that is the attitude that causes cultures to still clash all over the world. How much better if we could really learn to understand each other, forgive each others' mistakes, accept that we all have different views and at least get some small sense of where people are coming from.<br /><br />I am not saying we all have to approve of Elizabeth, or follow in her footsteps. However, I feel she makes many extremely important observations, and explains them clearly. She is speaking out for a large group of people. To at least understand her is to take steps towards understanding people you have to interact with in your daily life. To do this healthily and maturely can really be beneficial long term - for them, for you, for your social group, and for your community.<br /><br />For that reason, well recommended.>Now that all being said, I do not say that this book is flawless.

0385720920|1.0|I read this because I really enjoyed Fight Club and was hoping for something equally thought-provoking and edgy. Unfortunately, it seemed what works for one book does not necessarily work for another. Choke is preposterous to the point that it's difficult for the reader to suspend disbelief, and I just couldn't get past the smug vibe that permeated the book. Nor could I get past the shallow, ridiculous, pitiful characters. I wanted to kick each one in the backside and tell them to get a life. I get that the reader is probably not supposed to have much, if any, empathy for the protagonist, but that sure makes a book hard to read. However, with the clumsy, boring characters, self-impressed style, and childish-sex-fantasy coincidence of one of the characters being a sex addict, I suspect that this and other shortcomings of the book were not necessarily 100% intentional. This book left me suspecting that Palahniuk may be a one-trick pony, and it left me bereft of the urge to read more of his books in an attempt to disprove that.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|No mid term alternative : you love it or hate it. I loved it, saw it 5 times in theaters as soon as it was released in France last february. Wrote raving critics in sci-fi newspapers and websites... imho, one of the best (and certainly the most original, brilliant and credible sci-fi/monster film of all time).  Anyway, I was a bit disappointed by this dvd release, tho the image and sound are glorious, and this zone1 offers French, English and Spanish tracks and subtitles (even for all the bonus, which is quite rare...), but the alternate endings are quite poor and except a short making of and an uninteresting blooper sequence, not even one trailer or teaser (but there are those of Star Trek XI and Indiana Jones IV !!), and, more surprising, not a word, image or vid of all the material already shown on the internet and absolutely NOTHING AT ALL on all the back story (slusho, tagruato, the French environmentalist/terrorist movement, the Japanese action, and all the buzz and merchandising (caps, t-shirts, mugs, posters, fake websites and youtube, Mybook and other sequences...) surrounding either the film in the real word or the story in the parallel universe of those multinational Japanese, French and American societies fighting for the treasure of the oceans...
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|[ No spoilers, though if you've read many of the other reviews that's probably a lost cause for you anyway. ]    I'll keep this short and to the point: Cloverfield is an almost-entirely successful film in that it achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve, in spades.  All too frequently with movies of this genre you reach the end feeling bored, disappointed, and even cheated, but Cloverfield went beyond my highest expectations.  I'd recommend it without hesitation to anyone who's a fan of movies like this.    Two points about the negative reviews, which frankly astonished me when I first saw them, given how good the movie was.  First, it's true that it's filmed through a handheld video camera and is very shaky, but I got used to that quickly and practically forgot about it as the story hit its stride.  Second, I came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it might be vaguely X-Files'esque, and I think that made a tremendous difference.  If you know what it's about you may have certain expectations about how it *should* unfold, based on other similarly-themed films you've seen; since I had no idea at all and no preconceptions, I was able to just experience it on its own terms.  Reading through some of the negative reviews, it seems clear that that was often the problem.    In any case, don't listen to the naysayers; watch it and decide for yourself.

B003KGBIRU|4.0|The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's fifth film as a director and his fifth film to enter the Criterion Collection. Like all of Anderson's films, some may instantly fall in love with it while others will be rendered perplexed by what the hype is about. I fall somewhere in the middle of those, despite the fact that I consider myself a fan of Wes Anderson having liked all of his movies and having a certain fondness for his quirky, minimalist style. With that said, I'm polarized by The Darjeeling Limited as there's so much to like about it and little that I actually do.    The film follows Francis (Owen Wilson), Paul (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also a co-writer), three brothers who haven't spoken in the year following their father's death. They meet each other on the Darjeeling Limited, a train traveling through India.     There is a plot, but not much actually happens in the film. It progresses with the character's, who ride atop Anderson's style like a wave. The plot isn't the film's focal point; it's about character, tone, and style. Anderson has been criticized for valuing style over substance in the past, but this is one of the only films I've seen by the man where I felt compelled to use that criticism. While this is all perception as there are established relationships and/or scenes that may connect with someone on an emotional level, for me, The Darjeeling Limited never transcends something that's dryly humorous and pretty to look at.    It's a colorful film that's vibrant, alive, and fun to look at. It uses India as the landscape, but it isn't India so much as it is Anderson's India. The art direction is splendid and transforms India into a world of whimsical fantasy. It's also blessed with brilliant cinematography by Robert Yeoman, who seems to treat each scene like a separate photograph. There is no original score and the film consists mostly of Indian music (some of it lifted from the films of Satyajit Ray) and, as I've come to expect from Anderson, the occasional Rolling Stones song. The score of Anderson's films tend to blend perfectly with his filmmaking style, but his choice of songs throughout the film complement his style just as perfectly as well as capturing the time and place more effectively.    The three principal actors give perfectly low-key performances, as well as capturing the chemistry necessary to actually convey that they're brothers. Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman have a nice rapport with each other that is very convincing. Famed director Barbet Schroeder has a small role as does Anjelica Huston, although her role is much larger in the schemes of things just not in actual screen-time. In addition, Anderson regular Bill Murray makes a cameo rushing as a businessman rushing to catch his train in the opening scene. Anderson's unique, wry sense of humor is present throughout and it works as a result of being perfectly in tune with his actors. There are some scenes and lines of dialogue that may make you think Anderson invented the art of subtlety, as they sneak in so quietly they may go completely over your head.    Some of Anderson's films are less accessible than others and The Darjeeling Limited may be one of those films. Those familiar with his style will be pleased, if not completely thrilled...But those new to Anderson may be perplexed and confused by it. I'm not new to Anderson and I was even a bit perplexed by it. It's not a great film, but besides my gripe with its preference of style over substance, there are no obvious flaws; it just never reveals itself as a great film. Perhaps, like many Criterion titles, it takes time to absorb it and multiple viewings to appreciate it; but The Darjeeling Limited lacks a certain sincerity and coherency for me, which seems essential for a film dealing with such complex human emotions.     The 13-minute short film that precedes the film is Hotel Chevalier, starring Schwartzman and Natalie Portman, which is simply about Jack's former lover unexpectedly arriving at his hotel in Paris. I haven't read too much acclaim for this short and few mention it except to say that it fills in some information left unexplained in the film, but I found this poignant, minimalistic short superb. Hotel Chevalier has style and substance in perfect harmony, with Anderson managing to express so much with so little. Relying on very short, vague dialogue and the two actor's facial expressions; Anderson succeeds at conveying some pretty complex emotions in a very artistic, poetic, and lovely way. Even as a stand-alone short, Hotel Chevalier is something special and highly overlooked.    The new 2-disc Criterion DVD is a lovely addition to the Criterion catalogue and there's not a complaint to be had about it. It has exactly what you'd expect from a Criterion release including the film, the short film, and enough bonus features to keep the most ardent lover of this film happy for several hours. And, of course the artwork by Eric Chase Anderson looks terrific as usual. If you like this movie and you own the previous edition, you may find this Criterion version worth picking up.

B0013J30XG|5.0|Took my 9 year old son to see it with less than high expectations.  I shared with him some of the original Speed Racer cartoons, which he and I both agree were pretty lame :-)  Going into this movie, I expected alot of special effects (which is all you really see in the commercials) with not much of a storyline.  But I was pleasantly surprised not only that it had a story, but that my son was able to follow most of it (even with the flashback scenes)!  Granted he did not follow all the corporate mumbo jumbo and such, but he knew enough to know who the bad guys were.  The fight scenes were well done with some humor thrown in and no killing. And of course the special effects during the races were absolutely breathtaking! After all, these are the guys that made the Matrix movies!  I would recommend this one!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Seen this on TV first then knew I had to get the DVDs.  HD-DVD looks astounding (compared to my recorded digital broadcast).    Only gripe is that it does occasionally judder on my Toshiba HD-A3, I appreciate this is a problem with the player but an important point; given how many of us are stuck with this discontinued model/platform.
0143038419|1.0|I was about half-way through the India portion when I got tired of all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo and just started skimming.     The Italy portion was interesting in parts, but the writer comes across as extremely unlikeable and fake. We're supposed to sympathize with her for her \\"painful\\" divorce, when she'd moved on to a new guy before she'd even left her husband?       She's just the sort of gullible crack-pot that keeps people like gurus and medicine men in business.  I have a hard time respecting a medicine man who can't even take care of his own dogs.  And, um, his teeth...?  Does he not have a magic potion to fix those?

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Not what I expected, this is very good.  Much more emotional than previous work.  or - More accurately, the music and the vocals/lyrics are very well balanced in a way that is much darker than their previous work. Less sexier than their older stuff (if that makes sense), edgier.  Kind of like a more troubled Beth Gibbons fronting a cross between Nine Inch Nails and Bowery Electric.  Very good.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief offers a look at a little beauty within a mileau of gross, ugliness.  The character's struggles to exist, while their world deteriorates around them, was portrayed with such sensitivity that it was easy to \\"see\\" them as people, rather than as members of an outlaw nation, something, I think, we have been conditioned NOT to do.  That the narrator was Death, seemed . . . logical, given the circumatances.  Also, the style of presentation gives one the sensation of an effortless read. I heartily recommend this book for young adults and up.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|It was worth the wait! Donna Summer delivers her masterpiece: Crayons. This album showcases her amazing singing and songwriting abilities. A true virtuoso who does not want to be typecast as \\"Disco Queen,\\" Ms. Summer should really be called the \\"Queen of Music\\" for being able to breathe life into songs from different genres. From the anthemic \\"Stamp Your Feet,\\" the dramatic \\"Being Myself Again,\\" to the groovy \\"I'm A Fire,\\" the album contains singles that are truly masterfully crafted, with Ms. Summer's fantastic vocals giving each single a unique character and soul. Buy it, and you won't regret it!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Title pretty much says it all. I liked this movie. Everyone on these reviews complain about the shakey camera, which isn't really that shakey. I saw everything I wanted to just fine. Acting is good. And the special effects are just amazing. I think this is a great movie and it's very realistic and it's worth renting at least to find out if you like it, because you can't depend on reviews! Everyone has their own opinion!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is not only much better than I was expecting, it is, in fact, an extremely clever, well-executed, and scary movie. Kudos to the team that produced this film, as it could have gone wrong in so many ways.    Without providing spoilers, I will describe the premise of \\"Cloverfield\\" as follows: what if a monster movie were real? Now, that may seem like a trivial premise, because any work of fiction attempts to create a sense of reality. But think about it: there are fictional movies about \\"real stuff\\" (i.e. Howard's End, The Right Stuff, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.) and there are fictional movies about \\"not-real stuff\\" (i.e. Godzilla, Star Wars, Fahrenheit 911, etc.) Well, what if there were a monster in a \\"real stuff\\" movie? The effect would be, and is, quite unsettling, and this is what \\"Cloverfield\\" attempts, through the device of an unedited home movie that presents, in large part, the mundane material of which most such movies are made.    For this reason, \\"Cloverfield\\" reminds me a bit of Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\", which I felt attempted to do the very same thing (and which was also very effective). It also reminded me of Stephen King's \\"The Mist\\" (the novella, not the movies) mostly due to the nightmarish collision of unreality and reality that both share.    One thing that impressed me is that the device used in the film could have easily become contrived or gimmicky if not handled with extreme finesse; everything was spot on. I found myself grinning as the film really got going, enjoying what the filmmakers were doing. The grinning soon went away, as the movie is actually pretty scary.    \\"Cloverfield\\" leaves you wanting more, and with many questions unanswered. (Although, as with other J.J. Abrams works, some answers are there if you look closely enough...) If you love scary movies, and are not a TOTAL BABY about shaky, hand-held camera footage, you will love \\"Cloverfield!\\"
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Juno is a well acted smartly written film about every dad's nightmare. Having your brilliant underachieving daughter tell you she is pregnant well (knock on wood), that is one thing every Dad is terrified of.<br />So from the onset, I was resistant to buying or watching this film.<br /><br />Although I am still not sure that I want my youngest teen to watch this film, I found it to be one of the most moving and entertaining films I've seen in a long time, as the director and cast managed to make my wife and I feel something about every character in the film, which for me is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />It is my opinion that Juno deserved all of the accolades it has received, it is a very, very good film.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I think Cloverfield was one of the scariest \\"monster\\" movies I have ever seen. It was also thoroughly entertaining, as well as, disturbing. Filming the entire movie from a hand-held point of view was nothing short of genious. The effect: it makes you feel as if you're there, part of the action, and not just an innocent spectator. But, there are other reasons why this movie is frightening: 1. there are no big-time actors that play the macho hero who saves the day, so you can't assume or expect that this is going to end well; 2. The new, basically unknown actors are more like everyday people you can closely identify with; 3. Like the actors, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why this is happening. 4. There are no breaks from the intensity of the action, like changing camera angles or scenes.  You are here, you don't know what is happening, people are dying all around you, there is mass confusion, there are no other points of view, say from the safety of the President's Oval office, or some high ranking general's bunker. In other words, you are given one, and only one, perspective. Unlike most other movies, which switch scenes to put you \\"in the know\\", Cloverfield gives no answers.   The special effects and sound effects are outstanding, and there is one particular scene that is just too intense to explain. Suffice it to say that when the military suddenly shows up blasting away at the thing, all hell breaks loose, and like the actors, all you'd want to do is duck & cover.  Leave your pre-conceived ideas at the door, shut off the lights and crank up the volume.  Enjoy !!
B000YAA68C|3.0|My Irish wife was in the mood for a romance, and thought we would enjoy this film, but she fell asleep about half way through.<br /><br /> I managed to watch it all but came away more sad than warmed, as it is a movie more about resolution and loss than about love.  The message in the film is a common one, that you should let those you love in on your secret every day, not expect that they know it.<br /><br />But that's just me.<br /><br />Now my wife watched all the way through yesterday with our youngest daughter, and she really liked it after all. But she is a big believer in not getting over your true love (me too, but that's not the way I saw this turn). My bigger problem was the conclusion of the film where it reminded me of when my wife's Ford Expedition was stolen, she wanted another Ford Expedition. After you watch the film you may see what I mean... I felt like the inferred afterward in the story was kind of twisted along the same line.<br /><br />But again, that's just me.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is great! I bought this about 1 week ago and in that short time i can already feel a difference in my stamina. i started off with level 1 and at first i thought jillian was trying to kill me! I reached 11 minutes of the workout and thought of just shutting the dvd off...but i realised i had already finished half the workout! 20 minutes is an amount of time which anyone is willing to spend, before you know it its over (although your muscles will remind you the next day...very sore!) Well worth the money! if you're a busy person looking for a short but effective work out, i strongly recommend this dvd!
B00000ILDF|1.0|When the theatrical release of Alien 3 came out I was sooooo excited. Aliens was (and probably still is) my favorite movie of all time. Alien 3 opened on my Birthday, so even though my wife hates almost all sci-fi,<br />She agreed to take me on a date to see Alien 3 on the night it premiered.<br /><br />As the movie went on I sunk down lower and lower in my seat, knowing exactly what my wife was thinking, eventually I looked over at her, her right hand signing s-t-u-p-i-d over and over in AMSLAN. I was wishing I could make an argument but the truth is she was right.<br /><br />Now 16 years later I just watched it again, and my hopes and aspirations for a more enjoyable experience were again dashed. I remember when the movie first came out and the critics talked about how bold it was to use a  director who had never directed a feature film, and the director himself, saying like he made this movie for the 10 or 12 friends of his who would get it.<br /><br />Well, here's the bottom line, I love sci-fi, I love Sigourney Weaver, I love films about honor, and fighting in a lost cause, I love films with a metaphor, I loved Alien, and Aliens, and even with all this, I really didn't enjoy Alien 3.<br /><br />But that's just me.
B000VDDWDS|3.0|The audio quality is first rate; the video quality is not. The video image is only slightly better than the standard DVD release. It certainly does not merit the term high-definition. This kind of \\"high-definition\\" is what will keep the masses from adopting the medium. I bought this before reading any of the reviews. That was naive of me. From now on I will wait to see what the reviewers say before I buy another Fox Blu-ray release. Based on the weak effort displayed by Fox in Master and Commander, I fear the upcoming classic, \\"The Sand Pebbles\\", will probably receive the same short shrift. To any Fox execs out there, wake up and smell the coffe; you don't win market share by pawning off second rate goods.
B00005JPUN|3.0|The basic premise of this contemporary remake of the classic \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" is not bad.  Spores from outer space cause a Space Shuttle crash.  Haphazardly at first, and then deliberately, these spores infect human beings and take away their individuality.  The film presents their arrival as a mixed blessing that poses a philosophical dilemma: on the one hand, it is human individuality that leads to violence and war; on the other hand, without human individuality we would be missing something essential.  What that essential thing is the film doesn't say -- apart from the only partly glib answer that Nicole Kidman's character gives when asked what makes us more than animals: that the fact we now have postmodern feminism should give us some hope for the possibility of a better world.  What this \\"human\\" thing that the infected peoples lose really is we can only infer from the fear that the characters in the film exhibit in the face of its loss.  The film poses a question, that in the case of this version of \\"Invasion\\" is more a theological than a political question: is free will and its attendant evils really worth preserving at all costs?<br /><br />I like that the filmmakers are willing to push for the bold response to this question -- that peace is incompatible with individuality, and that the latter would be a fair sacrifice for the former.  On the other hand, I wish they hadn't pushed it so hard as to hammer in the contemporary implications of this message. The attempt to ratchet up tension by means of flash forwards and flashbacks that suggest the gravity of a situation also felt to me a bit overdone.  The film is lacking almost completely in subtlety, and doesn't quite make up for this in scariness.  On the whole this is not a bad film and strikes me as better than at least one of the sequels to the original \\"Invasion\\" -- and better than I had been led to expect from some of the critical feedback when it was out in theaters -- but not as good as I think it could have been with the talent and budget that went into it.  This may be the result of the studio's decision to pull the film from German director Oliver Hirschbiegel and make it into a more conventional thriller than he must have had in mind.k it could have been with the talent and budget that went into it.

0778321606|5.0|Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Lydia Hoffman has suffered through and gone into remission from cancer twice and now she wants to get on with her life. Her biggest dream has always been to open her own little yarn shop. After her dad's recent death she decided it was time and that he'd approve of her plans. Lydia opens The Shop on Blossom Street, A Good Yarn and decides to hold a beginners' knitting class to draw in some new customers and maybe some friends as well.<br /><br />Jacqueline, Alix (with an \\"I\\") and Carol all join the class and these four women couldn't be from more different walks of life. Through their weekly classes, friendship blossoms between these unlikely companions and all four women find new hope in their life, and a little love as well.<br /><br />I am so glad I recently found my way into the worlds Debbie Macomber has created with her novels! I keep asking myself why I never tried her before now since I've loved everything I've read so far. I've never even tried to knit something though I know people who enjoy it very much and like the community of knitters that always seem to find each other. Having the art of knitting woven throughout the books gives it a down home feeling where I can imagine women sitting around chatting about their lives as they work on their current projects.<br /><br />Debbie Macomber always seems to make me cry, in a good way. I was so wrapped up in the lives of the women that I felt Alix's frustration as she tried to keep up in class and her fear that no matter who she is, she'll never be good enough to fit in because of her past. As her skill grows, so does her confidence and Alix is like a new woman by the end of the novel.<br /><br />Jacqueline is the stereotypical blue blood when we first meet her, but as I learned more about her personal life she became very real to me and I saw her for who she really is - a woman who cares deeply about others and will do everything in her power to help someone else find what they need. I warmed up to her and soon realized she wasn't the ice queen people who don't know her think she is.<br /><br />Carol's story broke my heart. All she really wants is a baby and no matter how hard she and her husband try, it just isn't in the cards for them. Her desperation turns to fierce hope as we progress through her story, causing a lot of strain between her and her husband. I was probably more thrilled about the conclusion to her story than the others when she finally has the answers she seeks. And those answers aren't even close to what I had imagined them to be.<br /><br />Then there is Lydia, the heart and soul of A Good Yarn and Blossom Street. She is the narrator of this story and we see so much through her eyes. Lydia's biggest hurdle to overcome is fear. Her little shop is a dream come true and an affirmation of life, as she tells us several times, but even so, Lydia has a hard time actually living instead of existing. The three women she comes to love through her classes open her eyes to what living really means and she is finally able to let go of her fear that one day cancer will return. She comes to learn that even if it does, she can know she made the most of the time she had.<br /><br />What a wonderful book The Shop on Blossom Street is! I was drawn into the stories of the women and the struggles in their daily lives. I cried with them, laughed with them, celebrated with them. Many more women and men cross the threshold of A Good Yarn and our hearts and I can't wait to stop by for a visit with Lydia and company again soon.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2008.

B000S57S02|5.0|I still find myself thrashing out to Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 2 (and Part 1, natch). The Seven Keys albums are two of the all-time progressive metal greats. Bands are still trying to recreate the genius of this era, but I can't seem to find anything that lives up to it. Just goes to show that you have to keep moving forward, not back.<br /><br />There isn't a single weak track on either of these albums. I should probably point out some highlights, though. Dr. Stein is silly, but classic Helloween. Much as I enjoy the song, I tend toward the songs that peel paint off your walls. I find myself continually looping Eagle Fly Free, with it's soaring chorus and driving, relentless drumming. I Want Out is equally inspiring and anthemic. Though the track ordering is different than the original release (the version I have--yes, I want to check out the remaster), Save Us is a great way to finish the album. Just as you think things are winding to a close, the intro quickly builds into a galloping rhythm that leads to one of the most enduring guitar solos I've ever heard. The song (and album) end leaving you breathless and wanting more.<br /><br />Disc 2 here includes Savage, which is another one of my favorite go-to Helloween songs when I am in the mood to thrash hard. I have my version off of The Best - The Rest - The Rare, which isn't a bad disc for those new to Helloween to get a feel for what they are in for.<br /><br />Side note: Um, Amazon, would it be too much to correctly title albums and tracks in your music department?
0007153805|4.0|This is another fast-paced, bio-tech thriller by this author. Expertly weaving his narrative, the author grips the reader with his tale of nanotechnology gone wrong. While the book is wholly plot driven, with little attention paid to any character development. this lack does not unduly detract from the enjoyment of the book, as the plot is so gripping.<br /><br />The plot revolves around stay at home dad, Jack Forman, who was a whistle-blower about some high-tech espionage going on in the company for which he worked. Unfortunately, he revealed what he had discovered it to the wrong person and, consequently, was fired for his pains. While at home, he notices that his wife, who is a mover and a shaker for a bio-tech firm, has been acting a little odd and suspects her of an illicit affair.<br /><br />When her company wants to hire him to check out some programming problems at their Nevada facility, Jack jumps at the opportunity. He then discovers that the firm has engaged in an experiment that has gone out of control. A swarm of nanoparticles, designed as micro-robots and programmed to act as one mind, has escaped from the environs of the firm's desert laboratory. Programmed to be predatory, the swarm is deadly and evolving into something even more sinister with every passing moment.<br /><br />Moreover, he notices that it isn't only his wife that is acting a little odd. Others at the facility with the swarm problem are also acting a little strange. All is definitely not what it seems. The only question is whether Jack, with the help of the scientists at the facility, can take control of the swarm before the swarm overwhelms and controls them.<br /><br />This book keeps the reader riveted, despite the fairly predictable, formulaic plot. As do many of the author's other books, it also presents some serious ethical and moral issues for consideration by the reader, and the author himself gives a fairly detailed, cautionary foreword on the dangers of nanotechnology.<br /><br />I unwittingly bought the abridged, rather than the unabridged, audio book version for a road trip but was not disappointed. Narrated by Broadway and silver screen veteran Robert Sean Leonard, he keeps the story flowing in a nice, easy way, leaving the listener wanting to hear more. Quite frankly, when I arrived at my destination, I could barely tear myself away from the car, so engrossed was I by the story and its telling. It is a highly enjoyable, plot driven book.br />I unwittingly bought the abridged, rather than the unabridged, audio book version for a road trip but was not disappointed.

B000WQRFR8|5.0|I've been a metal fan since 1986, but I was never really into Kreator back in the day, preferring the Bay Area thrash scene, along with Anthrax and Overkill.<br /><br />But this resurgence in metal has me digging around to see what's being put out lately, and this album blows the doors off of most of the albums from even my favorite acts. Don't get me wrong, the latest Exodus album (Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A) is some of their best stuff (same for Testament's Formation of Damnation), but neither one of them instantly had me banging my head from the get-go and feeling the intensity throughout.<br /><br />I am so happy to be thrashing again to some really superb metal.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|After being a huge DS fan since the mid 70's, I didn't know what to expect with her newest album. Although Donna could sing the phone book in Japanese, make 12 tracks out of it and I'd be 1st online to buy it, this is one breath of fresh air from Donna. This album has something for everyone. The faithful Donna Summer fans will get a chill when they hear the first song \\"Stamp your feet\\". It's the good ole dance song Diva from the past! Her voice still grabs and wraps its arms around you. Every song will make you want to say \\"Welcome back Donna, we've missed you so\\". Then just give her a huge thankful hug.

B000002KET|5.0|Black Sabbath-Sabbath Bloody Sabbath ****1/2<br /><br />When I was asked to describe Black Sabbaths sound in my music journalism class all I could say was \\"Pompei, Black Sabbath is like the slow crawl of the volcano erupting and covering the village in certain death,' that explanation is about a cheesy and dead on as you can get. Ozzy's shrieks of heaven, hell, and strange dimensions in between combined with Iommi's under appreciated guitar work, and Geezer Butler and Bill Wards wall of rhythm, which by the way is the best in rock in roll, make this one of the heaviest albums of all time. I don't mean heavy as in loud and fast, I mean heavy as in slow, chugging, dark, scar the pants of your mother heavy.<br /><br />The only misstep on the album is, and now this is a big one, 'Fluff.' The song is useless. It is a beautiful acoustic melody from Iommi, but it does not work here, yes it does give variety to the album, but it takes away from it as a whole. It worked on other albums but not here boys. The legendary title track, 'A National Acrobat' my personal favorite 'Sabbra Cadabra' with it's stellar guitar riff, and 'Killing Yourself To Live' all went on to become Black Sabbath classics. 'Who Are You' can be trying at times, but more often than not is enjoyable, and 'Looking For Today' is an underrated gem. 'Spiral Architect' closes out the album, and just might be the craziest thing the original line up of Sabbath ever recorded.<br /><br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is easily one of the greatest albums in the bands canon. It might not be the bands heaviest (see Vol. 4) or their most popular (see Paranoid) but it is a classic that any fan would be happy to own.
B000069KGM|5.0|Listening to the very first Chicago album, it's hard to believe just how different they used to be back in the early days.    This album focuses on the raw, intense, dirty rock and roll style that was popular at the time.  It's much closer to something a band like CCR, Steppenwolf or the Rolling Stones were doing, in terms of raw intensity (but with brass instruments thrown in to make the band sound distinct).    I NEVER thought \\"Question 67 and 68\\" was a prom dance hit.  To me it's just a very beautiful and extremely difficult to sing along to POP song that's caught between a ballad and a pop hit.    \\"Liberation\\" almost features the same intensity and similarity to that of Frank Zappa's \\"Willie the Pimp\\".  The guitar playing is quite similar in both songs.      \\"Beginnings\\" was probably the biggest hit from the album, and features an atmosphere that can best be described as captivating.  The ending you wish would never end, it's THAT good.    How can you ignore what this awesome band was doing on the debut?  Oh sure, the next two Chicago albums are a bit better, but what a mighty fine beginning for an extraordinary rock band this one is.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy-Rockferry ****1/2<br /><br />Listen, good tunes is good tunes. Those naysayers who are calling this just a trendy, marketed album that wouldn't sell if it weren't for the advertising, well I must argue that untrue as I have never seen, nor heard an add for the album. I heard the voice on the radio and bought the album. So there ya go. She is apparently Welsh which must be where the charm in her looks and vocals come from. The smokey feel of her voice and the martini lounge attitude of the instrumentation make Rockferry a very rewarding debut album. On that note, this sounds very advanced for a debut.<br /><br />Songs like the sultry lead single (destined to be a massive hit) 'Mercy' and the defiant 'Stepping Stone' so a heavier more intense side to Duffy, while others like the elegant 'Warwick Avenue' and the Dusty Springfield-ish 'Serious' show a more refined, but none the less soulful side of her.<br /><br />While I do see that yes, there could be improvement but, not much, and for a debut, this is a damn good one. Duffy is destined to be a big star and rightfully so. The girls got soul!
B000000XCD|5.0|If you've heard at least three CCR songs in your lifetime and enjoyed them, guess what?  You WILL find a lot to like about Green River.  It's an entire albums worthy of that same raw bluesy sound and style.  It's just a great album if you like that sound, and nothing more really needs to be said, so please, pick it up as soon as you possibly can and experience just one of many reasons why the classic rock of the 60's and 70's deserves to be loved and remembered forever (oh, and sorry for sounding like a classic rock fanboy).  Oh, and if you remove \\"Night Time is the Right Time\\" you'd have yourself a perfect album!
B0013FBTHO|4.0|Number three of the same Story. But this time it is a Charm. Great storyline, Will Smith is always great, But this really let him shine.  Great cast and of course Great Special Effects! Loved it in HD.
0743289692|5.0|In this impressive memoir, Ayaan Hirsi Ali provides readers with an examination of her past and the intelligent, insightful revelations and reflections to has led her to regarding Islam and its treatment of women. She provides a remarkably balanced perspective, compassionate even to people who have done her many fierce wrongs. Amazingly honest and articulate, she provides a rare view inside the Muslim world, making it accessible to non-Muslims of every world view. If you haven't seen Submission, the film she co-produced with Theo Van Gogh, it's available here:[...].
B0010HOZX0|4.0|Wonderfully Entertaining. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Great ! Aaron Eckhart is a very good Actor, we should see more from him soon.Loved the plot and loved the chemistry. Great in HD.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is so fun to watch and so well done.  I never used to be a fan of foreign films, but this one makes reading the subtitles worth it.
B000RZIGZ4|4.0|I was lucky enough to see Top Gun when it was in the Theaters, Wow!! Tom cruise was at his peak. Kelly McGillis was awesome. The soundtrack by berlin was to die for !! Man it was so good in HD !.
B00154GEFU|2.0|I have to agree with those who have commented that the sound mix could have been better. I think the songs are fine but there's a sheen that homogenizes the sound so not much stands out but John's voice. Asia has had this before, to good effect, but I find this time it's glossing too thickly over the music.
B000GW8VTO|5.0|This is The Movie to end all Movies of Viet Nam. There was so much realism that I almost could not endure it at one sitting ! I was lucky to see this one in the theaters first and was impressed of course. But when I saw it in HD I bought the TV that was showing it in the Store ! Mel Gibson is Great! The Cast was great, So much young talent is very refreshing. History Buffs, Get ready for a fast ride !!
B0012Q732O|4.0|For everyone who thinks they know all about life in 10,000 BC, you don't. Last I heard, there are no written records. Yes, the mammoth stampede is the most exciting bit of the film but throughout this film maintains interest and believability. The landscape of the middle east and north Africa was different then so walking from glacier to desert was a possibility.  The acting here is good enough for the simple dialogue and story and the visuals are great. I guess some people expected to see dinosaurs. Sorry, wrong eon.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|I am enjoying this book, but I don't understand what all the hype was about. I tend to like character driven books and I feel that the character developement in this book is not up to my fantasy snob standards. That being said I am enjoying this book. Honestly my biggest problem was that I bought it thru a vendor and the binding is beat to hell.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Great thrill ride of a movie. People with no imagination should probably avoid it. But if you like science fiction and well made action sequences then this film delivers.
0765315246|5.0|I picked up this book on the recommendation of a fellow sci-fi and Heinlein fan, and I have to say, I find Scalzi far more entertaining and far less preachy than the Grand Master himself. I have already read Scalzi's other two books in this trilogy (the other two being The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony) and I think this first one might be the best of them.     The opening line is pretty telling: \\"I did two things on my 75th birthday. First, I visited my wife's grave. Second, I joined the army.\\" This tells you right away that the future is quite a bit different from the present.     Scalzi seems to take the \\"Star Trek\\" approach to explaining alien species - most of the aliens encountered in the book are, while not quite humanoid, at least anthropomorphic, and their living requirements (air, food, water, land) are more or less similar to Homo Sapiens. There is even diplomacy between the alien species, further echoing Star trek, and Star Trek-like explanations of faster-than-light travel.     Scalzi's style of writing is very contemporary and down to earth. The characters speak much the way you'd expect early 21st century teens or twenty-somethings to speak, complete with vulgarity and various informalities. There isn't a lot of political philosophizing, but Scalzi does take a stab at those who think diplomacy is the best way to solve every problem - won't spoil it for you, but understand it's an entertaining scene.     This is a great first novel, and I'm sure I'll be reading a lot more of Scalzi in the near future.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Awesome movie still a great piece of film that was not wasted. this movie open the door for a lot of other great movies. great classic. its like watching saw but without the traps and not too blood, guts, and gory. it does give you a new perspective on the seven deadly sins.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|In a way, it's hard to imagine Sweeny Todd not being great: It's full of artful gore, pitch-black humor, charming violence, great performances, and stomach-melting plot twists. It's got Tim Burton behind the camera and Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman in front of it. The violence is artful and the atmosphere is evocative and nightmarish. The performances (musical and otherwise) are powerful, forceful, and darkly beautiful. The setting is a hideously gorgeous portrait of old London as seen through a black and shattered mirror, a monolithic metropolitan nightmare collapsing into a sea of grime and dirt and human cruelty. Its surreal realism is classic Burton. The story is one of revenge, obsession, insanity, murder, and corruption, full of twisted morality and mangled romance. It keeps viewers interested. The songs are great, too: They advance the plot and keep the feel alive. And the blood-soaked ending is just plain superb. It's certainly not for the faint of heart; the body count does get pretty big, and the red stuff flows quite liberally. F*** the faint of heart. This is a great movie.
0767812166|5.0|This is a great film i grew up watching this movie and till today it still is a great movie. it is a love story and action and drama all rolled into one. The special effects are very good for its time. this is a great classic.
B00122M2QU|5.0|I have been waiting for an album like this since Chaos A.D.  Max sounds as powerful and fierce as he did on Arise, yet this album incorporates even more intelligent time changes, guitar solos, and extreme head banging guitar riffs that is reminiscent, and in some ways even better, than Chaos A.D.  In comparing this to any Soulfly album, it is far more furious, emotional, and forces a chilling expulsion of tormented energy from the soul.  This album is exceptionally heavy and dynamic; what you would expect from Max and Igor.  Thank you so much for making amends and producing one of the greatest albums of your ever so storied careers.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie has about the same idea as the prestige but this is only one magician. And this movie shows his true powers and abilities. it definitely is a great movie with a few twists in it. If you like the prestige then you will definitely like this movie a lot more. Don't get me wrong i have both movies i just like this one a little more than the other.
B0013FYTA8|2.0|There is one awesome song on this CD.  What makes it so good is a complete lack of originality.  Take a little AIC and go a long long way.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is just like the 1960 version. With a better face lift after all these years. The movie makers did a very good job with this movie. Its definitely a great movie for its time.
1595141715|5.0|This book is excellent. It shows a unique view on life and death. A somewhat creepy story that shows you that not everyone is how they appear on the outside.
B0007O38XU|5.0|This movie is just awesome and hilarious it really is a classic. If your a star wars fan this is a must. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed watching all the star wars movies and anime. This is a respectable spoof of the star wars film.
0451450523|5.0|Recently, I had the great fortune to meet the author.  HE is wonderful!!!!    He signed our books for the many children we love and his reading of this was a thrill.  Beagle is a story teller of the best kind and he continues to write wonderful stories  for children of all ages ( including grandparents).    The video is also a must.  Yes, it is different but it is a classic for my  children  and their little ones!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The video cam its not a clever gimmick and the plot had the makings of something good but failed totally. Glad I didnt waste money seeing this at the movies. If you have nothing better to do its visual fodder
B000005RRP|4.0|Deep Purple's classic album Fireball has been reissued, it has been remastered & has bonus tracks. Fireball was a groundbreaking album originally released in 1971 that peaked at #32 on the charts. At this point it was the second highest chart position for a Deep Purple album; their debut, Shades of Deep Purple, had peaked at #24 but that was a very different group. That was the group that had a hit with \\"Hush\\" which had hit #4 on the singles chart. There had been several member changes by this time.<br /><br />The remastering on this album is excellent & this particular version is an import on the EMI International label. The original album had seven cuts: \\"Fireball\\", \\"No No No\\", \\"Demon's Eye\\", \\"Anyone's Daughter\\", \\"The Mule\\", \\"Fools\\" & No One Came\\". \\"Fireball\\" & \\"Demon's Eye\\" are the two outstanding tracks here. All of the remaining tracks are very good with the exception of \\"Anyone's Daughter\\". It's definitely filler & weak. It was Deep Purple's tongue-in-cheek effort at country music.<br /><br />There are nine bonus tracks included in the 25th Anniversary Edition of Fireball. They include \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\", an A-side single that didn't chart, it has been remixed. \\"I'm Alone\\" is a B-side from a single. Two album out-takes have been included: \\"Freedom\\" & \\"Slow Train\\". All of these are average tracks with \\"Slow Train\\" being somewhat weak. Two remixes of the original songs are included: \\"Demon's Eye\\" & No One Came\\". An instrumental version of \\"Fireball\\" has been included that's interesting to hear. Two unreleased tracks are included that's basically Deep Purple fooling around in the studio that was captured on tape. They are \\"The Noise Abatement Society Tapes\\" & \\"Backwards Piano\\". The first of these is the group fooling around with some classics (such as \\"The William Tell Overture\\") & not always playing in tune or on time. It's a hoot the first few time you hear it then it gets old. The second one is exactly what the title says, it's not really necessary either.<br /><br />The cd comes with a comprehensive booklet that has a lot of information from the period covering when this album was recorded. Photographs from the period are also included. The reissue of Fireball with remastering & bonus tracks is a good edition to one's musical library. Though not all the bonus material is necessary, it does allow us to get an insight into some of the other things that go on in the studio. It's not all business. Being a musician myself that has spent time in a recording studio I can tell you this, more goes on than what you think.<br /><br />I would just like to add this: Deep Purple in this version (Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover & Ian Paice) was an extremely talented group. Ian Gillan has to be one of the 5 greatest vocalists of rock. Blackmore the same for guitarists. The other three musicians would probably fit in somewhere among the 10 or 12 best at their respective instruments. A VERY talented group!
0393327655|5.0|There is much reason in Harris' book and I agree with many of his points. Do I pray when my loved ones are sick or dying, you bet I do?!  But you have to read the book to understand the fears Harris discusses about religious zealotry, especially religions that use condemnation, damnation or hellfire to isolate and humiliate their congregations. A very intelligent book. I admire the author for his bravery in putting it forth and discussing it on talk-shows.   TEACH TOLERANCE.
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book.  It was not what I expected at all.  At first, I was a little cautious since it was in the young adult section, but I was not disappointed at all.  It took me a little while to get into the story and commit myself to it, but once I did, I fell in love with so many charachters.  It was very emotional - I cried the entire last 50 pages.  This book was is must read.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|This movie is sort of depressing but it was well written and had great scenery though I felt unsatisfied with having watched it. Maybe because it wasn't what I expected and because the characters future was left uncertain.
1594489505|5.0|This book was amazing.  Hosseini has captured the heart and soul of women in these pages.  A must read.
0694003611|5.0|I had a pleasure to read this to a preschooler, or two, finding this story intriguing.<br />Young children may handle this book better, because of its short, and the pictures are eye catching!
B000001DQI|5.0|I bought the CD because I'd heard a few tracks from the album on digital radio and decided that the new re-makes make recordings from 20 years ago pale.And I was correct.It sounds great.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|After reading the Other Boleyn Girl novel, I had probably too high of expectations for this film, since Hollywood is known for slaughtering great books.  Still, I paid my 7 bucks to see the film in theaters and sat aghast at the spectacle before me.  If you have read the book, steer clear of the movie if you expect the film to follow the novel, but if you haven't read the book or keep the two separate, the film is moderately enjoyable.  The costumes are pretty and the actors aren't too bad, with Natalie Portman doing a decent job as Anne Boleyn.  The problem I have is with the rediculous hack job they did in editing. Scenes just chopped into others without any form of a transition, and you are just left in confusion. They never explained what happened to William Carey (Mary Boleyn's 1st husband) in the movie, and she just magically is married to William Stratford in the end.  They also forget to mention that Mary has two children in the book not just a son, and they sadly do not delve into Mary and William Stratford's courtship, which was one of the most enjoyable portions of the book.  Hopefully, they will release an unedited version of the film to DVD, otherwise just stay clear.
0525950079|3.0|Yes, the first book was long as well.  But I found this book unfortunately to be a mere shadow of \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"  The bad guys just aren't as bad, good guys aren't as complex or interesting.  I finished it, but it wasn't without effort.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Wow, this movie is great. I wish there were more science fiction releases of the same caliber as Dark City. I definitely recommend this movie for those that like thinking out of the box. Once again, great movie.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|bought for my sister who raves about it. She really likes John Mayer  This album is her favorite shipping and packaging was perfect and quick
0756404746|5.0|BUY THIS BOOK! It will not disappoint you at all. It's the first book that I've ever read in my life where at no point did I ever become bored. Every chapter is there for a reason, and every chapter is interesting to boot. Patrick has got some serious storytelling talent. He skips over whatever might seem mundane and just sticks with the important and interesting things. It may be a big book but it's full of FUN things to read, not being over-descriptive at all.    Do yourself a favor and buy this book, I swear you'll not regret it.
B000003CKH|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend. He only knew of one song on the disc. After listening to the entire album, he really likes it a lot. The packaging and speedy arrival was excellent for me
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|What more can I add to the other reviews you've read? I just saw this and have watched it 6 times in the last two days. Hilarious dark comedy! Great direction and what an amazing cast. The expressions are priceless.     If you like watching people react under stress (in a funny way) then I think you'll love this. Really fantastic stuff.
B000002O1Q|4.0|Very diverse styles of music on this CD. If you like a song you really like it. If you don't, you really don't. It is worth having the CD for the songs that we really like.
B000YABYLA|4.0|My wife and I found this film to be different from most of the films these days.  We enjoyed Juno's character being such a \\"slang wordsmith.\\"  Kudos to the writers who created such a harmless, fun adventure with a story line involving unplanned pregnancy.  A most enjoyable movie!
B0017R1ECI|3.0|Don't even try to detect whether this movie is about the actual work of the spy or his unhappy family life. Something about the both. At the end of this thinly fictionalized account, one might even get persuaded that the work at the CIA is only for dweebs.<br />The beginning somehow resembles \\"The firm\\", where assiduous youngster ingrows into the closed society. But that's where the similarity ends. Edward Wilson (Damon) isn't Mitch McDeere. Despite his long hours spent in a library, nonchalance about women and inscrutable expression, Wilson simply can't be a raising star of the CIA, even if these vestiges have to testify that he has developed supreme analytical skills.<br />In fact, during the whole movie one can't stop asking, where does his authority come from? Even in those couple of episodes, when he instructs to execute the operations with a muffled voice from his home bureau, he appears to be a totally innocent bystander in a chaotic chain of events. Despite a group of famous actors, the main character of the film left me confused.
B00151G08Y|2.0|It's a letdown, plain and simple.  I can appreciate that they are trying to bring their sound in a new direction and also the jungle sound as a whole but they failed in their attempt.  Vocals are too soft and boring, seemingly devoid of any emotion. I've heard emo tracks with more edge than this.  Real Shame.  \\"Hold your Colour\\"...one of the best....to this...?
B000HEWEDK|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS EX. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT AND THE COLOR IS ALSO   GREAT. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I actually found this movie while shuntering around youtube, laughing through someone's silly period film montage. Upon investigation, I learned that the movie was called North and South, a 4-hour BBC production of Elizabeth Gaskell's love story of the same name, set during the 1850s industrial revolution. Having never read Gaskell's novel myself BUT having seen various clips of a handsome leading man I, of course, had to see this movie. And I am so glad I did because it is now one of my all-time favorites.           I am not going to give away the story by providing an extensive summary of the movie. I will say, though, that the collaborations in this film -from the screenplay, music, the performances, direction, cinematography, all the way down to the set design- just absolutely work, and you don't see many made-for-television movies that can do well in all those departments and that, furthermore, compliment each other as this one has done. It all seamlessly comes together to make North and South one of the best TV movies I have ever seen. It could certainly rival some of the best feature-length films I've seen as well, and I have seen A LOT of movies.           For lack of a more praising word, the acting is superb. All the supporting actors bring great depth and feeling to their respective roles. But no other characters in the film have such on-screen chemistry as the two leads, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage, who both give excellent, award-worthy performances. Since my first viewing of the movie, I have read and appreciated the novel and, looking back on it now, Denby-Ashe was fabulous for the part of Margaret; she had just the right amount of sauciness and spirit. But she also gave the character a bit of feminine grace that I think greatly improved the headstrong Margaret by making her appear warmer and more empathetic. In the novel, Margaret seems unreasonably cold and snobbish at times, and I didn't particularly like her, although I did admirethe fact that Gaskell had created a rather modern sort of heroine in an era when women were restricted by their gender.          Obviously, Richard Armitage's portrayal of mill owner, John Thornton, is one of the most passionate yet tortured performances ever, and he undoubtedly has the best smoldering capabilities out there; he is, in a word, fascinating to watch. He really does manage to convey his character's thoughts and feelings without ever saying a word; he is a very detail-oriented actor. I've read several reviews that compare his performance to Colin Firth's in Pride and Prejudice. While I personally haven't seen this adaptation that made Firth a sex symbol, after seeing Armitage in John Thornton's rolled-up sleeves and vest, I honestly neither feel the need, nor the desire to. Thornton, in print and on-screen, is a more intriguing, more complex character than Darcy, and I would take North and South and Richard Armitage, with his lofty height and brooding, dark good-looks, over Colin Firth and his Pride and Prejudice any day.    Devout followers of the novel should have very little to complain about with this version, as it is a very faithful adaptation. Sandy Welch has interpreted the story in a way that retains the novel's essence and romanticism very well. Obviously, some scenes in the book had to be adjusted for timing purposes, but instead of detracting from the course of events, as it could easily have done, it actually fleshes them out. Fans of the book may be outraged by what happens in Thornton's first scene (which was not in the book). But if you listen to the commentary the writer explains her reason for creating it and it's a valid reason because it really was necessary to initiate that kind of drama. But what people have to realize is that with any film adaptation you've got to be able to take it with a grain of salt. This one does not veer from the original source too often, so to see this new scene and the final scene of the movie, which wasalso rewritten for the screen, works for the kind of film that you've been watching for the last 3 and half hours.
B000VI70WM|3.0|I don't think I have to remind anyone whom Duran Duran are, but some people might be surprised as to how well-received their recent material has been. The best example of this for ME was back in 1999 when MTV had a short-lived video show hosted by Dave Holmes called Video Clich&eacute;s, and although I don't remember what the clich&eacute; at hand was, I do recall that they showed a clip from a 1997 song Duran Duran did called \\"Electric Barberella\\", and I was like, \\"Duran Duran was still around in '97?\\" And they've made new music since, as evidenced by THIS release, Red Carpet Massacre, where the five original members unite.<br /><br />By looking at the liner notes, though, some people might be turned off by the idea of Timbaland and Justin Timberlake appearing on a few tracks because it looks like a blatant attempt to cater to the younger crowd (read the one and two-star reviews and tell me I'm wrong). But to those of you with an open mind, don't worry; those songs actually work, as shown by \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Skin Divers\\" and \\"Nite-Runner\\"; in fact, I'm surprised the latter wasn't the first single. Those songs don't ALWAYS work though, as \\"Zoom In\\" is too metaphorically challenged, and \\"Tempted\\" is embarrassing enough WITHOUT Timbo and JT.<br /><br />But there are much better songs than those, like \\"Dirty Great Monster\\" and \\"She's Too Much\\". The title track is okay as well until the middle of the second verse when things start to go off-key. Red Carpet Massacre isn't anything like taking a trip to [[ASIN:B00005BJ9W Rio]], but it's still a good album.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
7119005901|5.0|Whether you've been there or not, \\"Three Kingdoms\\" will provide you deep insite into Chinese History and Culture.  Encapsulated in a Swashbuckler worthy of Hollywood, it is a roadmap to over 2000 years of a culture the West generally knows so little about.  Much as the tales of King Arthur, portray Romanized Britain during the disintegration of Rome, Knightly Brothers strive to preserve the Han Empire or carve kingdoms amidst battles, plots, counter plots, seduction, and betrayal.  These are stories that, even in English translation, show us as much about Chinese thought, in the way place, time, and events are portrayed, as can be gleaned from actual dialog.  Annotated, Three Kingdoms can read on many levels from light entertainment to historic cultural education.
B00001OH7U|4.0|Bowie constantly changes his music style and stage shows and he pulls it off every time. It takes a lot of talent and guts to play hard rock one day, disco the next, and still keep most of your fans intact. For me, picking a Bowie disc to play is difficult (because there are so many good ones), but I reach for this one the most. His vocals have a warm emotional tone that can send shivers up your spine, and I think some of his best vocal performances are on this disc, especially on the cover tune \\"Wild is the Wind\\". I've never heard the original version, but he nails the vocals on this! All the songs, musicianship, production, on this disc are fantastic, and the piano playing of Roy Bittan deserves special notice. Finally, the creepy saxophone accents on \\"TVC15\\", really enhances the song... nice touch. This is a classic, must have disc.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I saw Josh on Jay Leno tonight and had to see if his performance was a one-off or a pattern. Unfortunately, he sounds as if his tongue is halfway down his throat on this album. I compared his albums side-by-side, and his tone has definitely changed for the worse. If this was an attempt to \\"mature\\" his sound, it has sorely missed its mark.<br /><br />That said, Groban's voice is still a marvelous instrument, and if you are not picky about tone, it's a nice album, I suppose. I won't be buying it. I can only hope someone close to him will warn him before this guy does some real damage.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I ordered this for my husband who is a huge fan of watches. Of course, he wanted a Breitling but that's a bit of a stretch under our current budget. This watch has a good weight to it and doesn't feel flimsy like some cheap watches. It looks very nice and sporty without screaming sports watch.  This can work with a nice formal outfit as well.    PS. I used to work for a watch manufacturing company so it's pretty easy to tell how much was spent manufacturing certain watches so I think this is a pretty good deal!
0446402389|5.0|This book has been gettting great reviews everywhere.  I figured that many reviewers can't be wrong so I'll give it a try and it definitely lived up to the hype.  The characters are well fleshed out, the setting and time period are original in this genre, the pacing is fantastic, etc. etc. It's a great book and I can't wait until Mr. Smith's next book comes out.  This book is worth buying or getting at the library as soon as possible.
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|What a waste of good money. \\"Crayons\\" is dull and derivitive.  The only good song on the album is \\"I'm a Fire\\", a hot dance-track that is exactly what I thought this album would be.  If the rest was like this one, I would give it high marks.  \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" sounds like a rejected song from the High School Musical soundtrack.  I won't bore you with my reviews of the res of the songs.  Sorry Donna, I expected more from you after 17 years.
B000QQH4YS|4.0|Beware this is not the collectible steelbook edition. I had to return it. However Amazon's customer service is very courteous.
032147404X|5.0|The book is amazing. Who cares about the jokes in the first five pages!? If you are going to pass up buying this book because of a few negative reviews about the jokes then thats too bad.     Get it for what its worth. Great and fast tips. Let me just give you an example of how I used this book the other day for a fast tip. They were shooting off fireworks for Victoria Day in our city so I opened the book to the page on fireworks and he tells you straight. Put on a 200mm zoom lens, set your SLR on Manual Mode, Set it for 4 seconds shutter speed, set the aperture to f/11 and fire away. Its just that simple.
B000M5AJQ8|4.0|I am biased since I saw the original one first and was excited when I heard the news that they were remaking it for the US.  Although the movie wasn't bad in any respect, it just didn't quite live up to the original.  There were minor differences, but the main one was the ending that didn't match up.  Maybe they wanted to close it nicely or something, but it's not exactly the way the Chinese one ended.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Very dissappointing. Could only find 2-3 decent tracks on this CD.  Just not worth the cost.  Wish I hadn't bought it.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Another chick flick purchase.  Actually, I enjoyed this movie very much being that it added a little mystery/suspense to the bit.  Not QUITE Donnie Darko twisty, but it's fun to watch with a chick.  lol
B000O178BY|5.0|My first NIN CD and I wasn't dissappointed.  Great sound, very creative, must listen to entire CD.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Always a good chick flick.  I admit that I've seen this movie a number of times now.  I bought this as a gift for a chick.  She loved it.  The end.<br /><br />This movie portrays nicely the coincidental interactions and developing relationships between unlikely individuals.  I generally hate on Cameron Diaz, but she's pretty charming in this movie.  And Jack Black never ceases to amuse.
B000068TPN|2.0|A mix of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"300\\", the movie depicts the very first battle fought by Americans in Vietnam (- not for the Vietnamese, as these had already kicked out the French ten years before). Based on the non-fiction book by Col. Moore, it intends to portray a realistic picture of this first battle, while honoring the brotherhood between American soldiers, 'a la \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"    In a deleted scene (bonus features!) between Col. Moore and McNamara (who should be judged for crimes against humanity), the movie director is very explicit about his goal: \\"the movie is not about politics but about soldiers as human beings.\\" Soldiers and human beings, reflect upon that. Mel Gibson asks the sergeant, \\"Am I leading my men into a slaughter just like Gen. Custer?...\\"     For refusing any criticism of the Vietnam War, the movie gains a Rambo-esque look. Americans are depicted as limpid, good-hearted individuals, Christian white males who heroically carry wounded brothers on their shoulders (note: in the two scenes, the wounded ones are a black and an Asian-American man). On their side, the Vietnamese are depicted as a massive army of clones, desperately defending their home against the invaders. Their home. But, again, the only explicit reference to this truth is made in the deleted scene between Moore and McNamara. Delete reason. Go figure.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|One of Will Smith's best works yet.  He does a superb job playing the role of Chris Gardner.  And his son does a pretty good job in the movie too.  A must have for those who enjoy a touching drama suitable for the whole family.  Based on a true story.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Boyfriend loved it. Nearly fanatic Beatle fan and this really worked for him and I found myself watching it much longer than I'd have expected. it's very interesting. Lisa
B000063DFN|5.0|The fact that Bruce says ''Albatross'' a couple of times during ''...Ancient Mariner'' is worth the price and the reason this album is a classic.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Spider-Man 3 was AWESOME!!! Loved the plot and all the thrilling stunts and special effects. This makes for a great movie because the whole family can watch it. Stayed true to the original comic book and I can't wait for another Spider-Man movie just as good as this one. The ending was great too!
B00007J4SI|1.0|RISCONTRO OGGETTIVO: il cd, nonostante ancora sigillato(quindi nuovo) presentava la custodia spaccata in più punti, probabilmente dovuto al fatto che il libretto interno era troppo grande forzando la custodia.  La qualità di registrazione è veramente pessima, i livelli audio sono bassissimi e ciò è aggravato dal forte rumore di fondo che si sente. Inoltre i toni bassi sono appena percettibili. Sembra quasi una registrazione amatoriale. Infine mancano alcuni brani e ciò è specificato solo all'interno del libretto, nemmeno su internet.  RISCONTRO PERSONALE: Non ho gradito affatto le interpretazioni dell'autore, che mi risultano incredibilmente ampollose, forzate, e prive di ogni cantabilità.  CONCLUSIONE: L'unico riscontro positivo di questa raccolta è il prezzo molto contenuto.
B000U7169M|3.0|This movie had a good plot that led you to believe many different things were going to happen in the end. Hillary Swank is a great actress, but I don't think she delivered in this movie. The end was a total FLOP, ruined the whole movie, which could have been a great movie.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Step aside Madonna, Mariah, this album is just as good if not better than Janet's Discipline, the best album of this year alongside Crayons.      After 17 years, she's back!!! I am listening to the album for the tenth time today. It leaked this morning, and it's a great thing it did!! The album is wonderful mix of dance, R&B, pop, with Latin, Jamaican and African touches, as well as a feel of gospel/church music.    \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" starts the album, a great, positive, uplifting track that makes you move. \\"Mr. Music\\" shows that Summer is with current trends, still shaking it at 59, and that she has an iPod. The track featuring Ziggy Marley is called \\"Crayons\\" and is a hot beat with an island twist. Summer even tries on the accent but actually has success unlike Mariah Carey who attempted the same on her recent record \\"E=MC2\\".    \\"Fame (The Game)\\" talks of the pros and cons of Hollywood life, with a cool vocal style. Highlights on the album would have to be \\"Sand On My Feet\\", a heartfelt love song, and the rock-tinged \\"Science Of Love\\". \\"Bring Down The Reign\\" has an interesting tribal chant inserted, which helps to finish off the album. It's a great song, keeping in line with the \\"Queen\\" theme of the album.    Overall, the effort is an admirable one. Summer comes back after 17 years with contemporary production while remaining true to her roots. It's the disco queen modified for the present. And it works. Make sure to pick up your copy on May 20th in the States, and June 23rd in the UK.    6/5
0618526412|1.0|never received it, or response to e mail- or a call from amazon. bad all the way around.
B0014YVC6W|4.0|To anybody who is getting the blu-ray version, can you please let me know if it has english subtitles or closed caption? I am deaf, thanks!
B000OV170W|5.0|This book was passed on to me and I was told that once I began my reading, I wouldn'be able to put it down.  That is the truth!  I am not done reading it but find at the end of a busy day, I can't wait to retreat into my bedroom with a hot cup of tea and this book. It is excellent.  I give it 10 stars!
B000URDEB0|4.0|There is a wonderful quote of unknown origin that sums up this album perfectly:  \\"A ship is safest in harbor; but that's not what a ship is for.\\"  This is the album that everyone in metal - fan, critic and naysayer alike - was talking about in 2007 before its release.  Having sacked their much-beloved frontwoman Tarja in 2005 - THE most familiar of all the operatic sirens in metal - this band was treading in dangerous waters indeed.  As the undisputed leader of this band, Tuomas knew the cannons would be directed at him, especially for choosing a singer who was not a Tarja clone, one Anette Olzon.  The Nightwish ship simply HAD to deliver a winner or run the risk of sinking amid the treacherous waters circling all around them.  But deliver they did.<br /><br />\\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" is, on many levels, the best and obvious choice to start out the album.  With pomp and celebration, it is just like a ship leaving harbor for its maiden voyage, complete with the essential champaigne christening.  Starting out sounding like the introduction to a Harry Potter movie with its etherial and magical single voice, the fire and bombast we have come to know and love from Tuomas soon announces itself loud and clear as the orchestra, choir, guitars, keyboards, bass, and drums explode all around you.  This 14-minute beast is easily one of my favorites of theirs of all time, delivering both epic and somber moments with confidence and ease.  About ten and a half minutes in, it sounds just like the ending part of \\"Death, Come Near Me\\" by Draconian (another 14-minute song, go figure), Anette even doing her best Lisa Johansson impression.<br /><br />\\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" is the infamous comment on Tarja's firing and the not-so-ironic opening song in concerts.  That one and its two successors, \\"Amaranth\\" and \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\", are obvious caterings to the American market with their somewhat watered-down, pop sound.  I frankly think their potential was squandered a bit.<br /><br />And yet . . .<br /><br />And YET . . . I find myself singing those songs.  I play them just as much as the others.  I LOVE them, even when my arrogant, progressive sensibilities probably shouldn't.  So like my high school basketball coach always said about putting the ball through the hoop, \\"That's what this game is all about.\\"  They have me hooked.  'Nuff said!<br /><br />There are two Marco-sung numbers in the mix, the latter an acoustic folk tune called 'The Islander\\".  Think The Byrds mixed with The Chieftains and infused with a small shot of Dylan, all watered down a bit for subtlety - and that makes for a mighty good musical drink indeed.  The first one, \\"Master Passion Greed\\", is one more comment on the subject of Tarja, this one focusing more on her (according to them) greedy and manipulative businessman husband Marcelo.  And this song sees Emppu having another one of his delightful identity crises, pummelling our skulls with crushing riffage like he's in Helloween or Megadeth, as he did in \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" two albums ago.<br /><br />One instrumental tune graces the pack, something they haven't done since their second album, \\"Oceanborn\\".  It's about time, too.  \\"Last of the Wilds\\" is a Korpiklaani-like romp through the backwoods of Finland.  Anyone else listen to that song and pine (pardon the pun) for a collaborative album between Tuomas and Jonne?  Emppu and Jukka, too, sound quite at home dueling their guitars and drums nicely with traditional instruments like fiddles, whistles and pipes.<br /><br />Do I miss Tarja?  Yes I do.  She has a voice like no other, one that melts my heart with every song.  But it became obvious on \\"Once\\" that the internal junk in this band was stifling Tuomas' creativity - there are, quite frankly, less than stellar elements on that album.  Great album, but you could hear and feel the stifled inspiration.  On this one, the creative freedom is once again flowing freely, and Tuomas proves why he is, without a doubt, oneof the most talented and gifted songwriters in the world.  As the lyrics of \\"Poet\\" hint at, Tuomas indeed died in 2005 . . . and was reborn stronger than ever to forge a new beginning for this most beloved of bands.  Anette had some HUGE shoes to fill . . . and she has done it beautifully, with grace and professionalism.  She isn't Tarja, but her voice is just as beautiful and powerful in its own special way.  Just as importantly, she has given this band a needed shot in the arm.  Why, I dare say this band is having a great time again!<br /><br />Just as the first song was chosen wisely, so goes the story for the last song, \\"Meadows of Heaven\\".  Meadows of heaven indeed.  Simply a beautiful song.  Tuomas has once again expertly steered us on a voyage through the high and dangerous seas of the musical world.  The closing moments of the album bring this ship safely . . . serenely . . . and sublimely back into shore.
B001929D38|3.0|Fans of bands like the Fleshtones and the late, great Pandoras will feel right at home with this. Good, upbeat and engergetic.
B000O1799U|1.0|This movie is totally boring. There is no plot. I am glad I just rented it from the local library.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This is a lovely movie. It is the perfect combination of funny, sad, dramatic, adorable, upsetting, realistic, and everything else that makes real life so beautiful. A must-see film for any teenager or adult. Very well-written, with complex, relatable characters.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Amazing - Brilliant - For a woman who is going to be 60 years old in December this album should compete with all current songbirds out here.<br />I think it will do well in Europe and hope it takes off in the USA.<br /><br />DONNA you still have it BRILLIANT
B0000026KQ|5.0|'Guitar Shop' is one of Jeff Beck's best records. It features the legendary musicians Terry Bozzio on drums (of Frank Zappa, U.K. and Missing Persons fame) and Tony Hymas on keyboards (he also appears on Beck's 'Who Else!' and 'Jeff' records).     And it won the Grammy award in 1990 for the best instrumental rock performace, and rightfully so. This is easily one of Beck's best records, and it's worth buying the album alone just to hear Bozzio and Beck jam together. Add Hymas' classic synth textures and classical style and you have a masterpiece.    Some of the highlights here are 'Guitar Shop,' 'Savoy,' 'Two Rivers' and 'Sling Shot.' But the whole record is great.    If you enjoyed some of Beck's earlier records like 'Blow By Blow' or perhaps even 'Wired,' than chances are you'll love this record. It's a great Beck record that's well worth buying.    Highly recommended for any Jeff Beck or guitar lover. This is a great album. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. ENJOY!!!
0007229682|5.0|There's a kind of breathlessness about this wonderful autobiography, a sort of \\"I gotta tell this story, get it all out, and say it right.\\" that carried me almost non-stop through it.  This is no polished work edited to smithereens, it's raw, real, moving, and a lesson in how one climbs over the debris of a rotten childhood one step at a time and makes it thru commitment and hard work and dedication to a chosen profession.     I first saw Ramsay in his \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\" on BBC America.  Having cut my teeth on Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", I had the advantage of not being all that shocked at the ghastly mess some of these professional restaurant kitchens are in and could focus on his approach to trying to help the restaurant of the moment start to get back on its feet.  It was his passion and skill and kindness to the youngest employees and selected others of the staff and the frequent humour around his eyes that grabbed me.  The cussing and the yelling were just a reflection of his passion, and I could have cared less if they were appropriate.     And \\"The F-Word\\" reveals other aspects of his character that start to share a fuller picture of who this man is - the jokester (e.g.,the wine-tasting test with the guy who couldn't even identify his own wines), the boss in his own kitchen, the father of those marvelously smart, funny, giggly, balanced little children, the cook with those wonderfully simple elegant recipes that we can indeed make at home, etc. etc. etc.      So buy the book and settle in for a good read - there's still a lot of Ramsay one can learn about by doing so.  He may not particularly care for being an example (I read it as \\"Quit yer whinin' and dig in and get to work.\\") but he's stuck with it now.  Thanks, Mr. Ramsay.    :)
B0000027RL|5.0|If you've never heard 'Ten' before, I don't care what style of music you like, whether it be classical or tween pop, you must listen to Pearl Jam's 1991 debut and masterpiece 'Ten.'    This was the record that skyrocketed PJ to fame. Sure many classics would follow, like 'Binaural' and 'Vs.' But this was the record that jumpstarted Pearl Jam.    And with songs this perfect, it's not hard to see why. 'Even Flow,' 'Jeremy,' 'Porch,' and 'Alive' are some of the greatest songs ever written, and Eddie Vedder's flawless voice helped make 'Ten' the ideal grunge record.    And it sounds just as fresh today as it sounded 17 years ago. This record is by far Pearl Jam's best record, although every record they put out was superb, but it's not only PJ's best record, it's one of the best records PERIOD.    If you've never checked out 'Ten,' than you are really missing out. Highly recommended for any music lover. A masterpiece.     ENJOY!!!
B0014I4KIK|2.0|I have been hearing so much about this album and after listening to her song 'Mercy'I picked up her album wanting to hear more. I was so disappointed! All of her songs start to sound the same. I'd say only 5 out of the 10 songs on here are worth listening to a second time (Warwick Avenue, Serious, Syrup and Honey, Mercy, and Distant Dreamer).
B000SO7OM0|5.0|This wonderful recording is like Loreena's greatest hits. I strongly recommend it for anyone who likes Loreena or who is trying to decide which CD to try first. The DVD concert is very nice because after listening to her music all these years it fun to see what all the nstruments look like. Her voice is so polished and her delivery so perfect that there is no distortion like sometimes happens with live performances.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|Best group of characters ever, the actors are excellent, the characters interesting and often funny and even the \\"nerd\\" is likeable which is seldom the case. I just could do without some of the graphic human tragedy - too many close ups of the bodies and autopsy.
B001736FDK|5.0|I was thrilled by this book! It was so different and refreshingly imaginative. My husband and I both enjoyed this book and the rest of the series very much! If you like fantasy adventure and are looking for book that is wonderfully written with unforgettable characters then buy this book. The \\"voices\\" of Nathaniel and Bartimaus are singularly memorable. The wit and the struggle/respect between these two make the books very enjoyable. We listened to this series on audiobook and the narrator made it incredible. I can't recommend this enough and I frequently do, for both teens and adults.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Based on previous reviews, at this web site, I bought Celine Dion's Las Vegas Concert \\"A New Day\\" on Blu-ray.  I can honestly tell you, the show was FANTASTIC!  I have a Playstation 3.  The only negative surprise was that it was recorded at 1080i instead of 1080p.  In spite of that, from a technical point of view, I thought the video was razor sharp, the colors were dazzling and the audio was second to none - with true, distinct sound separation.  My surround system is not expensive, but this recording made it seem like it was top of the line!  The second portion of Disk 1 was an excellent tribute to the fans. This is an opportunity to see Celine interacting with her fans. Clearly, what you see is what you get.  She's the real deal and down to earth - no pretending here.  The second disk reveals all the \\"behind the scenes\\" work (and the number of people involved) it took to bring this concert to life. It's quite an undertaking.  No wonder these concerts cost so much!  Definitely worth seeing - but not until you've first seen the concert.  To do so, would only spoil the effects they're trying to achieve.  I would highly recommend this recording to anyone.  Truly, this is Blu-ray at its finest!
0452289963|5.0|I understand why a lot of people might find this book difficult to digest, but I took it slow and read about 5 pages a day, and by the 3rd chapter I felt like a new woman. Fast forward five months, and my life is so much easier, my romantic relationship has turned a positive corner, my work-life has improved--in essence my whole life has simply become EASY. I look forward to reading more Eckhart and other likeminded books and continuing my spiritual journey toward a happier, more peaceful, better contributing and balanced life.
0792163710|5.0|Anybody who has seen this film, can never forget those words, nor the scene nor the music that goes with them.  These days, they are even more poignant.  Our land is being taken over, not by grasping cattle barons, but by . . . well, if you don't know who by now, you'll probably never know--until it's too late.      I wonder about people today watching this film for the first time.  Do they think that these were just dream characters, mythic creatures who never really existed?  Do they realize that the majority of Americans in the 1940s and 1950s were like this--men of integrity, courage, conviction, who were willing to stand up for their convictions, act on them, fight for them?  Yes, with guns, since everything else had been tried and had failed.    The Old West is gone, but a New West is upon us, and the challenges it presents are every bit as urgent, every bit as crucial as these presented in \\"Shane.\\"  Then, it was farms.  Today, it is homes, and schools and clinics, and . . . just about everything else.  Are there enough Shanes to do the job now, enough Starrets and Toreys?  And do the Joeys of today look up to people like Shane?  Or is it Wilson who wins their admiration?      These are questions we'll soon see the answer to.  And when we do, we'll all be crying, \\"Shane!  Come back, Shane!\\"
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I got hooked on Torchwood in season two, so naturally I had to have season one so I would know what happened up til now....I just love the variety of stories it offers & of course John Barrowman is easy to look at too...I can't wait til season two comes out on dvd & looking forward to season three....a very talented cast those englishmen....
B000ZN802W|5.0|[[ASIN:0385486804 Into the Wild]]This is the heartbreaking story of a very bright young man who wants to live totally on his own in the wilderness.  As he bums around the country, he meets a few adults who try to advise him--which is something his parents didn't or couldn't do--but he is determined to do it alone.  He isn't unprepared for his life in the wild, but he's just unbalanced enough to miss the danger signs.  Emile Hirsch makes Chris such a lovely, likeable young man that I wanted to grab him, hug him and save him.  Incredible wildlife and scenery footage of Alaska and more.  The movie was far better than I imagined.
0805047905|5.0|My 2 yr old loves to have this book read to her everynight.  Very good book.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This album is really great. All the tracks melt with dance beats. She is def back!! My favorite song...\\"The Queen Is Back\\". I can imagine how many drag queens will be performing this song. I hope it becomes a single!!
B000FIHJLK|3.0|What you think about Richie Blackmore is a question of taste.  I always feel he a much better composer than a guitar player.  Yes, he is good, but not great; he could never stand up to people like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Uli Roth and Hendrix.  Blackmore's solos are more atmospheric than anything and never quite catch fire. But he has a great sense of melody and comes up with catchy and melodic licks over and over again.  He is really good at what he is doing. But let's leave it here.  I want to talk about something else : the sound quality of this recording.  The quality of this recording is really not up to par.  The mix is all mushy and muddy.  I could almost say the recording was done with a microphone recorded straight onto a two-track cheapo Phillips  recorder.  If the music was recorded mult-track, then it is a feat to make the end-product sound so murky.  This is supposed to be an offical release.  I have heard bootleg recordings from that period sound a lot better.  As to the music, no problem with that, Richie always delivers the goods : reliable, disciplined, well-rehearsed and almost mechanical.  Really pleasant and unobtrusive music to listen to any time.  Bubble gum Rock.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I'm sure a lot of people are going out and buying Duffy's debut album, \\"Rockferry,\\" after hearing the single \\"Mercy.\\" I am one of those people, and when I listened to the CD in its entirety, I was blown away because \\"Mercy\\" is probably the weakest song on the whole album, which says a lot because \\"Mercy\\" is such an amazing song. However, the rest of the album is even better! Duffy's voice is out of this world. It's soulful, powerful, and absolutely beautiful. People who compare her to the likes of Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield are not exaggerating, but Duffy is really in a league of her own, as she brings a youthful panache to every song.<br /><br />As for the album itself, I don't even know where to begin. All the songs are incredible. If I have to pick a favorite, it's probably the title track, \\"Rockferry,\\" which is amazing. My jaw literally dropped when I listened to it for the first time. Other highlights include the wistful \\"Warwick Avenue,\\" the soulful ballad \\"Stepping Stone,\\" the blues infused \\"Syrup & Honey,\\" and the inspiring \\"Distant Dreamer.\\"<br /><br />My one complaint about this CD is that it's too short...there are only 10 songs, but they are OUTSTANDING songs. Duffy has an amazing career ahead of her, and if you only buy one CD this year, make it \\"Rockferry.\\"
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|After 17 years since her last studio album, Donna has returned to the spotlight with her smash CD \\"Crayons\\". It's a mixed bag, Donna-Style. Her flawless, strong vocals are back once again. The Queen is back indeed! Having grown up in the mid 70's, I've always liked Donna's singing and her songs. Crayons is right up there with the best music of 2008.<br /><br />\\"I'm a Fire\\" is flaming and stands out among the tracks, with its mix of Disco and modern-day \\"light\\" club-sound. No wonder it's turned out to be Donna's first remix single! \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is a perfect opener and totally rocks. I've both these CD singles here at home. Crayons is quite laid-back and not entirely dancy or club-floor sounding as I thought, which isn't bad. There's also a rock-edge mixed with Pop, Reggae and electronica. All these styles intertwined with Donna's full, in-your-face, throaty voice, makes this CD a true winner. Track 6 (Sand on My Feet) is so floating and rich with beautiful vocals and lyrics. I'd say it's an \\"Easy Listening\\" type of song and very summery through and through. You'll notice they put Donna's voice through the synthesizer quite a bit through the CD, but it works pretty darned well.<br /><br />Lots of thought, heart and soul went into this recording. Track 9 (Slide Over Backwards) is very entertaining with its country style and very amusing vocal style. Chorus line is fun and the whole song could've worked very well in Tina Turner's repertoire. I think this is Donna's most electic album to date, and definitely worth playing for family & friends.<br /><br />The CD is housed in a lovely black digi-pak with a fully illustrated booklet (16 pages). The digi-pak is a tri-fold layout. The interior middle section features the same closeup eye shot as on Donna's \\"I'm a Fire\\" cd single cover. Right flap holds the CD and the left flap holds the booklet. All photos of Donna are beautiful and she's looking ageless. the outside of the left flap features another photo of Donna.<br /><br />Crayons is a definite winner for your summer listening & beyond. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to discover a true legend. I'm glad Donna is back because there are too many commercially fake & obnoxious Divas out there, if they even deserve the title \\"Diva\\". Crayons is perfect for putting on your Ipod, for there isn't a song you won't like. So go and get yourself this CD and let Donna heat up your summer.nner for your summer listening & beyond.

0891419195|5.0|With the Old Breed does for World War II's Pacific Theater what Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers does for the war's European Theater.  The difference is that Eugene B. Sledge lived through the battles he describes in this outstanding memoir of modern war.  Sledge's detailed, emotionally wrought descriptions of the horrors of the World War II battlefield are reminiscent of Norman Mailer's novel, The Naked and the Dead.  His firsthand accounts of ferocious combat on Peleliu in the Caroline Islands and then on Okinawa leave the reader breathless.<br /><br />Sledge's Marines of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (K/3/5) of the storied 1st Marine Division are as tough as they come.  Their exploits are the stuff of legends, and through their incredible courage on Peleliu and Okinawa they honor the precious legacy of the many combat Marines to come before them.<br /><br />The kill-or-be-killed actions of human beings essentially reduced to animals struggling for survival on a tiny coral atoll against a ruthless, fanatical and, yes, even suicidal enemy is difficult for most readers to stomach, much less comprehend.  Yet, we find ourselves reading on if for no other reason than to root for the young enlisted Marines who shoulder the heaviest load in this fight.  These remarkable Americans demonstrate yet again why they are collectively known as our country's Greatest Generation.<br /><br />Sledge's portrayal of a vicious, man-on-man fight in the South West Pacific to wrest control of a chain of seemingly insignificant islands from the desperate yet determined Japanese is at once both haunting and captivating.  One alternately feels revulsion at the atrocities committed on both sides and empathy for the young Marines struggling to survive.  Many barely out of high school, these 18 and 19-year-olds are thrown relentlessly into the meat grinder that was part of Admiral Chester Nimitz's Island Hopping counteroffensive. They journey from the innocence of youth into an early manhood spent 'across the sights of a rifle' or kneeling behind a mortar tube.<br /><br />We witness these young men participating in frontal assaults on Peleliu against an entrenched and well-equipped enemy whose capable use of machine guns and indirect fires (artillery and mortars) steadily reduces K/3/5's ranks.  We see Marines desperate to dig fighting positions in virtually impenetrable coral rock... hugging the 'deck' as enemy artillery and mortar rounds bracket their positions.<br /><br />The Marines' steady attacks are contrasted with their brief defensive stands at night.  As darkness descends on the dug-in troops so do the Japanese.  The Marines find themselves in frenetic, bare-fisted fights in foxholes against a crazed, marauding enemy with fire in his belly and a rifle with razor sharp 18-inch bayonet in his hands.  As we attempt to grasp these men's hellish existence on Peleliu and their struggle to defy the odds and leave the island in one piece, we are left to contemplate the utter senselessness of war... and those shocking conditions that would reduce man to his basest instincts.<br /><br />In addition to his account of the fight for Peleliu (referred to as the 'Peleliu Campaign'), Sledge relates his experiences during the fight for Okinawa ('the Okinawa Campaign').<br /><br />The Okinawa Campaign oddly begins quietly as the invasion is largely uncontested.  Remarkably, given the island's proximity to the Japanese mainland, the Marines initially do not encounter the same 'chaotic maelstrom' that they experienced on Peleliu.  Instead, we readers are treated to descriptions of an idyllic, almost serene, Okinawan countryside and occasional encounters with a few friendly Okinawans.<br /><br />But the calm the Marines experience belies what awaits them in the deep and dangerous recesses of Okinawa's system of interconnected ridges and draws.  Much to K/3/5's horror, on Okinawa the Japanese have perfected the defense in depth and interlocking fires that characterized their defensive tactics toward the end of the war.  And they bring to bear all the might of an increasingly desperate empire intent on sealing off their homeland from the Allied onslaught.<br /><br />The Japanese suck the Marines into kill zones and proceed to pick them apart through carefully targeted machine gun and rifle fire.  As the casualties mount, the men of K/3/5 realize they will not have an easy time of it on Okinawa after all.  The ensuing weeks find these men in a no man's land feeling Hell's fury as they face off against the bulk of the Japanese Thirty-Second Army.<br /><br />We readers wonder how the men of K/3/5 keep their sanity and how they are willing to continue slogging through the mud and filth to engage their merciless Japanese adversary.  What is even more jaw-dropping about Sledge's experiences and what leaves the reader absolutely awestruck is how these fine, young Americans manage to continue their frontal assaults against an enemy occupying all but impregnable defenses.  Amazingly, many a young Marine rifleman leaves the relative security of his foxhole on Okinawa and runs full tilt into a hailstorm of bullets and shrapnel.  And falling in behind that Marine is yet another Marine!  Unbelievable!<br /><br />While many are casualties on both Peleliu and Okinawa, it becomes obvious as one reads Sledge's story exactly how others somehow survive.  Quite simply, they stay close to the 'Old Breed' - those combat-hardened, veteran Marines who have dedicated their lives to the Corps... some of whom cut their teeth at Belleau Wood in World War I... and many of whom fought on Guadalcanal, in Cape Gloucester (New Guinea) and in those many other battles in the Pacific that have inspired the legend that is the United States Marine Corps.  Many of the 'Old Breed' form the vanguard of attacking Marines and set the example for the raw and inexperienced recruits.<br /><br />We realize then that many of the new troops fight on because they yearn to join the select few - the genuine article, authentic U.S. Marines... and the very pride of the Corps.  Men such as Captain Andrew A. ('Ack Ack') Haldane and Gunnery Sergeant Elmo M. Haney, veritable demigods among American fighting men, assume almost mythic proportions to the younger members of K/3/5.  Sledge and those like him internalize USMC lore and aspire to be combat Marines who serve selflessly and valorously... and who reflect the finest traditions of the Corps.<br /><br />As Sledge points out without a hint of humor, men like Haldane and Haney are not 'born of woman, but are issued to the Marine Corps.'  To receive the approval of men like these is to finally join the ranks of the few, the proud...<br /><br />Sledge nearly bursts with pride when he hears 'the simple, sincere personal remarks' of a veteran Marine after his (Sledge's) actions on Peleliu.  The veteran Marine offers the following comments to his young comrade:<br /><br />\\"But I kept my eye on you on Peleliu and by God you did OK; you did OK.\\"<br /><br />While the veteran's comments seem modest, Sledge goes on to say that he \\"carried those words in [his] heart with great pride and satisfaction ever since they were uttered.\\"<br /><br />With the Old Breed is an extraordinary tale of man at war and will forever remain one of the most authentic, vivid stories of an enlisted man's experiences on the front lines ever told.  Sledge's writing is characterized by great depth of feeling, honesty, and clarity.  The realism with which he depicts the battlefield enables the reader to practically experience for himself the sights, sounds, and even smells of battle.<br /><br />With the Old Breed, however, is about much more than war and the depths of man's inhumanity.  Throughout his memoir, Sledge liberally sprinkles humorous anecdotes and subtle musings on the bonds that form between men fighting for survival while exposed to the nightmarish conditions of modern combat.  So, With the Old Breed offersa deeply meaningful and enduring commentary about devotion to duty, loyalty, and brotherhood.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Sledge's message is really much deeper even than that.  As horrifying as his experiences were on Peleliu and Okinawa and despite his decrying war as \\"brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste\\", Sledge acknowledges that we as Americans are sometimes called to sacrifice for our country and for those many freedoms we hold dear.<br /><br />Freedom is not free!<br /><br />As The Old Breed is fond of saying, \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\"<br /><br />A Classic!e very pride of the Corps.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I am not a huge Madonna fan but having grown up in the '80's I would be a liar to say that I did not appreciate some of her work over the years.  This CD is AMAZING!  I am a bit distrubed by several critics take on this CD. (Not Amazon's) Most critics have stated that the album is not Madonna and that it is the producers CD and she is \\"over produced.\\"  We are talking about a female artist who after 25 years has still been able to make herself creative and marketable.  True, that the bass and rhythyms of this CD did not come from Madonna.  But isn't that the purpose of working with different producers? I don't hear anyone complaining when Britney, Gwen Steffani work with the Neptunes or even when Johnny Cash worked with Glen Ballard (of Alanis Morrisette fame).  Enough about my bitterness towards the critics.<br /><br />In short get this album, if this is not one of the best Pop CDs you have have heard, then I am sorry for you.  So Madonna sold out to big name producers, so what? I am thankful she did, I just wish it was sooner.
0061537934|5.0|In Garth Stein's touching story, the appealing narrator is a dog named Enzo, who (of course) cannot communicate as he'd like to, by talking with his family. Instead, he pours his considerable heart and spirit into this book, sharing his experiences and reflections with readers. Although Enzo is frustrated with his limitations as a canine, he comforts himself with the fact that, according to a documentary he watched about Mongolia (Enzo is a dedicated television viewer), he will be reincarnated as a human. And he knows a lot about being a human after watching his master Denny Swift, who is a hero to him.    At the beginning of the book, Enzo is just barely clinging to life, so he spends time reflecting upon his past. As Denny, who is a race car driver, has told him, drivers cannot contemplate their moves while they make them. Racing is like living; you can only do it and then remember it at a later date. For Enzo, in these last days he immerses himself in memories.    His reminiscences begin with the day Denny chose him out of a heap of puppies, taking him from a country farm to an apartment in Seattle. Although Enzo doesn't enjoy living there, he adores Denny and thus looks on this as a good life. He later develops a fondness for Eve, \\"the interloper,\\" who Denny falls in love with and marries. He stands in literally for Denny on the day that his daughter, Zoë, is born. Denny is off racing in Daytona, Florida while Enzo is at the new mother's side.    For Denny, the joyous day of Zoë's birth is overshadowed as his racing career takes a beating. After a year of obtaining sponsorships in order to enter the race, he loses this hard-won opportunity to shine when a driver on his team has an accident. Denny returns to his day job as a customer service representative at a luxury auto shop.    Shortly after giving birth, Eve asks Enzo to promise to protect the little girl, and the dog's feelings of commitment to his family are intensified. Enzo's role in the family becomesthat of caretaker and watchdog. He takes his role of protecting his loved humans seriously --- and faithfully not only watches over them, but also manipulates their lives, often in humorous ways, to ensure that they are taken care of. This loyalty will be needed as their lives are about to unravel.    When the family moves to a small house, Enzo enjoys a cozy backyard and sunny spots to lounge in. Eve chooses to go back to work, so Zoë enters daycare, which leaves Enzo at home, bored, until Denny begins leaving the television set on for him. But his happiness is short-lived, for he is the first one to realize that something is seriously wrong with Eve; his acute sense of smell has detected a decaying odor emanating from within her head. When Denny is away from home at his next race, Eve wakes up with a terrible pain. It's so bad that she gathers Zoë and goes away, leaving Enzo alone for days.    While this is unfolding, Denny's team has won first place, and he's had an offer from a big-time team, but he must turn his back on the racing he loves as he has more urgent matters on his mind. Eve suffers an increasing array of terrible symptoms, such as mood swings, vertigo and nausea. She sometimes screams from pain yet refuses to seek medical care. And when she inevitably receives the worst diagnosis possible, the family is torn apart, beginning an intense emotional rollercoaster ride. Through it all, Enzo supports them in every possible way.    THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN is getting all kinds of buzz, and it deserves every accolade. Readers will be moved by this warm hug of a story (and may find themselves looking searchingly into the eyes of their own canine companions). Enzo is a charming and witty narrator. His tale, while hilarious at times, is quite often heartbreaking, but it is ultimately uplifting and heartwarming. And I found the ending to be oh so very satisfying!        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)

1416562591|2.0|Reading through the pages I found myself oddly comparing the book to Philip K Dick's \\"The Zap Gun\\" - for those fortunate enough to not know why - let it suffice that you are very fortunate indeed.  I'm surprised a veteran journalist came up with a plot so mundane about the textures of India. Maybe the flip side of being a journalist is that the close encounters with the dark sides of society ultimately bias your opinion. In my view the book's biggest pitfall is that the author was so immersed in the the dark side of things that he could no longer traverse the shades of grey in this black and pitch dark perception of Indian society - dont get me wrong the author did try towards the end of the plot - by trying to put a spin on the main character's reflections on his experience, but failed miserably. The author could not resist falling back on the dark rhetoric which forms this novel. This being a book of fiction saves grace for the author and hence the 2 stars.

0393061310|5.0|..it wouldn't be \\"one damn fact after the other,\\" a comment on the study of history that Diamond references. His historical book is the antithesis of the \\"big man\\" version of history, so-and-so meets X, and says this and that, and decides Y.  His is a study of history in its broadest swaths, examining the proximate reasons for a given outcome, but always striving to ground his work in the ultimate causations.<br /><br />One of the numerous strengths of this book is Diamond's multidisciplinary command of the increasingly fragmented fields of human knowledge.  He can readily draw on linguistic theories, archeology, paleontology, literature, agriculture, etc. I found his brief explanation of Carbon-14 dating lucid, with the important emphasis on the recently discovered variability in this isotope in the earth's atmosphere over the last 50,000 years.  He draws on his long anthropological  experience in New Guinea to buttress his central premises, and I personally found his account of the human expansion into South East Asia, Australia and Polynesia most illuminating. Another high point was his description of the Spanish defeat of the Incas at Cajamarca in 1532.<br /><br />He provides very plausible answers to seemingly difficult questions as to how 168 Spaniards could defeat 80,000 Incas, as well as the central question of the book, \\"Yali's question,\\" why the \\"whites\\" had most of the \\"cargo,\\" and the New Guineans so little.  His thesis is that the environment and geography are the paramount determinants, and it was where particular mammals could be domesticated, and certain grains could be cultivated that determined where \\"civilizations\\" would eventually arise.  With a class of individuals not devoted to acquiring food full-time, they had the time to develop technological improvements to the human condition.  In addition, an incidental condition occurred due to man's proximity to domesticated animals - diseases, which certain individuals developed immunity to, and which decimated populations not previously exposed, as in the Americas. He does not totally dismiss that quirky \\"human factor\\" of a few great and not so great men, and specifically speculates how the world might have been different if Hitler had been killed in the 1944 assassination attempt, or even earlier, in a 1930 car accident.<br /><br />Aside from the numerous thought-provoking aspects of the book itself, I found myself reading many of the 93 1-star reviews of this book posted at Amazon (out of at 1048 as of this writing).  How could this many people strongly dislike the book? (By way of comparison, another best seller, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's \\"Infidel\\" has only 3 1-star reviews out of 216). Many simply denounced the book for being \\"politically correct,\\" meaning that he provided a non-racist answer for why some societies are more technologically advanced than others (but not necessarily happier!).  Others fell asleep (!) reading this enthralling account of humankind's development, but I really could find no one who indicated factual errors (some were claimed, but I wondered if they had actually read the book, because they made assertions that Diamond did not.)  I too looked for assertions I would contest, and felt his statement that the wheel would not have helped the people of Mesoamerica without domesticated animals to be incorrect (for anyone who has ever used a wheel barrel), but later in the book, Diamond also raises this point.<br /><br />Overall, a superlative book, and a start towards making the study of history a science.opulations not previously exposed, as in the Americas.

B0014I4KIK|3.0|So many reviewers have compared this to Amy Winehouse's breakthrough \\"Back to Black\\" album, but I must insist that this is at least twice as good as Amy's spectacular album. Irrespective of their offline behaviour, the fact remains that despite Amy's unusual vocals and instrumentation, I found \\"Back to Black\\" rather tedious and 'same-sounding' after a point, and the weight of its lead single \\"Rehab\\" didn't do much for me either.<br /><br />\\"Rockferry\\" on the other hand, stands out as a pure, sparkling gem, the likes of which you've probably never encountered before. What is especially good to know is that Duffy isn't the winner of some forsaken TV reality show like 'American Idol' but rather a quiet, Welsh-born 23 year old who worked hard for three years before releasing this. While many listeners have complained that Duffy sings of love and relationships that are way out of her young years, you can't deny that her voice is fresh, inspiring, and she's chosen absolutely the right kind of music to accompany it.<br /><br />There are three primary standouts on this wonderful album. Lead single \\"Rockferry\\" is almost heartbreaking in how simple and poignant it is - I was reminded of those old 1960s songs by Francoise Hardy and Twiggy. Try to find the video to this as well - it has Duffy walking a train station and streets all set to a moody, black and white cinematographical endeavor. \\"Mercy\\", the ubiquitous No. 1 hit in the UK is an obvious standout (it is also the catchiest thing here). But the best song here would have to be the lesser known \\"Stepping Stones\\" which is a sparse tune that really shines.<br /><br />\\"Rockferry\\" certainly deserves its' place in the sun. These days, almost every other solo artist is hyped as the 'next best thing'. Leona Lewis, anyone? If you consider Leona Lewis to be 'good music', then chances are you might not be able to appreciate the beauty of this album.

B00151A6TI|4.0|Considering the second part of Beardfish's album was supposed to document the \\"night part\\" of the concept, one might have thought the songs on this platter would be darker in tone, emphasizing moodier soundcapes compared to the off-the-wall material that permeated the first disc. It should be noted that this is not the case here -- at all.<br /><br />Rather, Sleeping in Traffic - Part Two expands on the first album, retaining its eclectism from start to finish, even building on it. Still steeped in the roots of 70's progressive rock movement, Beardfish continue to produce all-encompassing material, often borrowing from the Zappa and Gentle Giant library and bordering on avant-garde at times. A song like \\"South of the Border\\", for instance, sees the band highlighting their sense of humour, as it is informed by a plethora of soundscapes, from the spoken vocal parts to its classic rock tendencies to the downright frightening instrumental wizardy (where blazing organs clash with oddly tuned guitar work) to its ever-funky rhythmic pattern.<br /><br />On the instrumental piece \\"Cashflow\\", they delve into full-on avant-garde territory, which might even be a challenge for the avid Zappa fan. At six minutes, it sees a multitude of sound experiments infused into quirky instrumental passages -- almost too much to take on first listen. Actually, the first and last songs only function as an intro and outro to the other six songs, as they both clock in at less than two minutes: the first tune is just a segment of warm melodies whilst the last one is a solemn piano bit fading into white noise.<br /><br />Then there are the more song-based yet equally bizarre numbers. \\"Into the Night\\" is like an excerpt of the tunes on part one, rightly so. The first part is filled with playful instrumental craze, while the second part is jazzier and darker conjuring up images of the night, ever so briefly. There is a unison solo happening towards the end, where agile melodies are interwoven and climax in typical Fripptonics fashion.<br /><br />The laidback, bass-centric \\"The Downward Spiral / Chimay\\" sees Rikard Sjoblom extracting ever-changing synth tones from his instrument, but there is also a soothing, dreamlike acoustic section complemented by beautiful percussion work. The clarity captured here is awe-inspiring. The husky bass intro of \\"The Hunter\\", arguably the band's most bizarre work, opens the track as rousing synths crash into the piece all too unexpectedly. Organs dominate, vocals of Sjoblom - intentionally so - continue to fluctuate between normal singing and the delirious, lunatic tones. The lyrics are equally mind-boggling: \\"It gives me satisfaction to see you scared and running   And when you bleed you bleed only for me   So peel back the skin of your skull   Cause I wanna see what's inside.\\" The band is being terribly sarcastic it seems, and the ending of the song where lofty guitars and keyboars unite in order to form a cinematic experience is stupifying.<br /><br />Then of course there is the title track, merging the two discs beautifully, with common threads of melodies and themes. At over thirty-five minutes though, the song can be hard to internalise at one sitting, but one comes to experience its unity and flow upon repeat listens. This is basically the whole Beardfish sound captured on one tune, and it begins and ends exactly the same: with cold bass throbs cascading irregularly.<br /><br />A concept album about the 24 hours in a person's life, part one was about the day and this one is about the night, and a more challenging listen as well.

0446693804|1.0|If I could've given this book less than one star, I would have.  I saw the movie before I read the book, and loved it.  It brought tears to my eyes, and now I know it's because of the talent of the two teen leads.  The book?  It has cookie-cutter characters, plot as slow as molasses, is filled with manipulative platitudes, and is unbelievably dull.  I felt no emotion at all about these characters.  As a writing instructor, I've read better novels from beginning writers who instinctively know how to plot a book better than this.<br /><br />I don't understand why books like this hit the best-seller list.  There are thousands of better romance writers out there that are unrecgonized.  Me, for one.  Not that this book could be, by any stretch of imagination, called a romance.  This is a prime example of how the gender of a novelist determines the success of a book in the marketplace. If this book had been written by a woman, I have no doubt it would've gone straight to the remainder bins.<br /><br />Carole Bellacera<br />Author of Understudy

1423101464|5.0|Percy and friends have it hard this time. Annabeth has been chosen to lead a team into the labyrinth, which they have discovered an entry in Camp Half-Blood. Grover has been given a week to fine the God, Pan, or his searcher's license will be revoked. Luke is an ever present threat, as well as Kronos. But I can't tell too much more, or I will give it all away.<br /><br />This series is still good. In fact, it's so good. I devoured this book in about two sittings and now I should reread it because, wow... it's so good! I feel like Riordan is starting to go downward on his story arc, so I believe we can expect one, maybe two more books, and that is it. That said, these are quite popular, and Riordan may be compelled to pull an L. Frank Baum and just continue to write the series.<br /><br />These are still one of my favorites. I like them more than Harry Potter, still, because it's Greek mythology and that has always been a favorite of mine. I will be sad to see these go. That said, we have a little while before that happens. I'm so glad that Riordan continues to write this, and I am so glad that it is snowballing in popularity. I love these books. I loved this book. I am so happy about it all.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|The second teaming of Denzel and Russell provides a very difficult movie to film in that there are two movies here -- Denzel's and Russell's.  This is a very taut, drama about good and evil and what somebody believes is survival is a crime to somebody else.  Russell is very good playing a different role than what one would expect in that he is the flawed good guy.  One of Russell's crew is John Hawkes, one of the doomed fisherman in Perfect Storm.  Surprising, there is not as much violence or blood that one would expect, but rather a story of the lives of two men, not so different from each other.  A must have to own.  Watch for an unaccredited Clarence Williams III, an icon from the 1960s.
0312370830|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" consists of two parallel stories; the contemporary story of Julia, a journalist researching events surrounding a roundup in Paris of Jewish families in 1942 and the story of a young girl, the titular Sarah, caught up in the nightmare.<br /><br />The novel jumps back and forth between the two stories in a way that makes Julia's personal problems seem insubstantial and petty. It's difficult to sympathize with her marital woes when they are interspersed with the struggles of a ten-year-old to survive the destruction of her family and life in occupied France.<br /><br />The key in question unlocks a hidden cupboard in which Sarah has hidden her small brother, expecting to be back in a few hours. The suspense surrounding her brother's fate is settled halfway through the book and is particularly well handled.<br /><br />Julia is a fascinating character and it is unfortunate that she is so overshadowed by Sarah. The death of a relationship, the expatriate experience and the concept of \\"home\\" as well as the way we become emotionally bound to a baby while it is still a bundle of cells are all themes Julia's story takes us through. Her French family's reaction to her findings are nuanced and varied.<br /><br />There aren't enough books translated into english, so one that will receive attention is something to celebrate. Unfortunately, the translation here lacks a graceful understanding of linguistic nuance. Every so often I was wrenched from the story by a sentence or phrase that  seemed directly taken from the french. This book deserved better than that; her editors should have urged de Rosnay not to undertake the translation herself.
B000002GJS|5.0|I was surprised to hear one of the negative reviews say this album was so horrible compared to the previous ones. I thought it was a perfect progression from his previous work. I love Reckless, etc. but I also love this album, so I must respectfully but strenuously disagree with that statement.    I also take issue with people who bash Bryan's lyrics, and his \\"radio friendly\\" songs. First of all, If a song has great lyrics, that's great, but many people, including myself, aren't looking for thought-provoking poetry here. We're looking for a good, fun song, and Bryan delivers that in spades. And since when is it a bad idea to write songs that work particularly well on the radio? That IS where most people hear them, isn't it? Now you can take this approach WAY too far (Nickelback, etc) but I don't think he does at all.    And as far as the lead guitar work on this album, it rivals that of Reckless. The highlights would have to be \\"Don't Drop That Bomb On Me\\" and \\"Everything I Do,\\" but almost every song on this album has some great solos.     Rhythm work is rock-solid here as well, with some of his patented hooks in songs like \\"Can't Stop..\\" \\"Hey Honey I'm Packin' You In\\" etc. \\"House Arrest\\" is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard, and the lyrics are fun. No need to talk about drugs or having sex like most other musicians do, just a fun ride.    Some of the songs on this album did take a while to grow on me, namely tracks #1,5,6,and 11 but they are some real hidden gems, as far as I'm concerned. If you like Bryans music, get this album. Simple as that. I wish he was still writing music like this.
1416550518|5.0|I read a preliminary review of this in a library journal and knew I was going to have to snatch it up the moment it came out, which I did when it was released last month. It's not often one can say that about a debut novel, so I really have to take my hat off to Kate Morton, because what a debut it is!      As seems to be the case in just about every novel I've read lately, the story jumps back and forth from the past to the present.  I don't always care for that scheme, but it's so appropriate here that it makes all the difference in the flow of the story.  Grace Reeves is an old woman now, living out her last days in an English retirement home, when she's approached by a film-maker making a movie about a family Grace used to work for - in particular, about a popular poet from the Edwardian age who is said to have committed suicide on the family's estate.  Like every young talent taken too soon, Robbie Hunter has become a legend in the way of James Dean and Marilyn Monroe. This movie about his death is not particularly novel, but it's the first time anyone has thought to approach Grace about what she might remember from that time. Grace was a servant in the Ashbury family for many years, as her mother had been before her, and it's from Grace's first day at Riverton that she starts her tale.      Grace is almost exactly the same age as Hannah, one of the Ashbury daughters, and feels an immediate bond with her.  When Hannah marries years later, Grace stays with her as a lady's maid instead of marrying herself - one of many unfortunate missteps made among the intertwined lives of these people.  Grace learns some of the family's most alarming secrets, including one involving Grace's own mother, and one final, shattering tragedy brings home the fact that deception of even the most innocent kind can wreak untold havoc.  Grace has spent a lifetime trying to forget the events of her time at Riverton and her role in them, and is now forced to relive the whole thing all overagain.  She always knew the day would come.     This story is so excellently told, spun out with such perfect flow and timing, that I find it hard to believe this is Morton's first published novel.  I haven't been this excited about a new writer since Carol Goodman came on the scene seven or eight years ago.  I'll follow Morton just as devotedly if she continues on in this vein.  The House at Riverton is an excellent, captivating story.

B0010X745K|5.0|WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS    Let me start by saying that this is an extremely disturbing movie. Prepare to feel disgusted and creeped out after watching it. It's violent. It crosses lines many films refuse to cross. It has a lot of swearing. It's not a family-flick, that's for sure. But in any case, it's a horror movie. What were you expecting?    I must say that I'm let down by many of the reviews here. I enjoyed the film greatly, especially the ending. It was a powerful, scary movie that made you think. Compared to most \\"scary\\" movies that have come out lately, such as Saw, which are nothing more than torture pornographies for seriously messed up people and brainless teens, The Mist is quite refreshing.    One thing I'm noticing is that many people who have viewed the film are taking the wrong things from it. Let us start with the argument that the film was a \\"rant against the evils of Christianity.\\"    This film does not specifically target Christianity, nor is it saying that religion is evil or wrong. Instead, it shows us how religion, a positive force, can be twisted and used by others for personal gain and destruction. Yes, there was a character in the movie who believed in God, who used her beliefs to do horrible things, but that does not mean The Mist was bashing Christians or Christianity. To believe so is ignorant, really. Are we to believe that every movie who has a black villain is saying blacks are evil? No, no, and no.     I find it amusing that the reviewer who complained about the supposed anti-Christian rant then said, \\"the monster of the film is not actually the monsters, but the crazy Christian lady,\\" as if this was a ridiculous idea. But YES! They were absolutely correct. That was the whole point of the movie. This film is not about the horrific monsters roaming in the mist, scary though they are - it's about the monsters HUMANS turn into when they face the unknown. As one character says, when we're stranded in the dark without the conveniences of the modern age, like the ability to call 9-11, and we're scared badly enough, we'll do anything to survive. ANYTHING. And then we are the monsters. As Stephen King wrote in The Shining, \\"this inhuman place makes human monsters.\\"    The second major complaint, that the ending was ridiculous and way too violent, is also tiring. I mean, really. It was not THAT horrible - they did not even show the boy's body. It was also another important message. But I'll let you figure out what that message is on your own. Here's a hint: remember the lady in the beginning who ventured into the mist, risking her life to save her two children at home? Remember seeing her with the soldiers, staring down at the main character, safe and sound with her kids, whereas the main character has failed his son? There's an important point being made here.
B000002GGU|5.0|There's not much else I can add to what others have already said about this album. It's one of the most perfect, flawless rock albums any musician could create. This and \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\" can stand up against any top album in history. Please note that, up until a few years ago at least, and maybe still, this album had the record for the most #1 hits on any album.<br /><br />Since everyone has heard the big songs on the album, I'll just mention a couple of highlights that they may not have heard.<br />\\"She's Only Happy When She's Dancin'\\" is a great, upbeat song with an amusing and all-too-relevant story to tell. I'm sure there is at least one woman in your life that this song will remind you of. The lead guitar playing on here is great, too, and there is lots of it. It's a great song, lyrically, just because of the funny story it tells.<br /><br />\\"Long Gone\\" is a really cool, bluesy sounding song with a catchy riff and awesome lyrics. I still smile every time I hear the bridge of the song \\"She took the fridgidair, she got my favorite chair, you could say she got the best of me...\\" etc. haha. Great stuff.<br /><br />\\"It's Only Love\\" is just a phenomenal song with crazy, high energy, lead guitar breaks through the whole thing. Keith's work on this song is second to none, in my opinion. It's these kind of solos that are completely absent in Adams' recent work, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />As I said, if you like guitar-oriented songs, and like Bryan's voice, this is a no-brainer. I've had this album since 1991 or so, and I still love it.

This is quickly becoming my favorite new series and I can't wait for the next Night Huntress book to come out.  In the second of this series, One Foot we continue where Halfway left off.  When Cat finally see's Bones again it's just hysterical!  This couple has great chemistry.  The characters are interesting, funny, and hot!  The story line is exciting, and moves along at a fast pace, I was never bored.  I just hope the next one lives up to the first two.

It's so enlightening and truly does \\"awaken you to YOUR life's purpose\\". I can't even tell you how many ah-ha-moments I have had while reading the book and I promise, you will, too!
B0015KO52S|5.0|Best rock album of 2008! This collaborative sophomore effort of The Greenhornes and Jack White of The White Stripes is energetic, exciting and addictive!  The songs range from hard and heavy to bluesy and even stretch to bluegrass sounds.  Brendan and Jack give it their all in these interesting lyrics and harmonize very well together.  If you're a fan of either band, this is a must hear CD.
B0015KO52S|3.0|This is a good record. Not a great one. Jack White is a God. But this seams to pick up where the last White Stripes album stopped. \\"Consolers\\" doesn't have that song that you can sing to. There is no catchy riff. Which is what I loved so much about their first album. It was so different from Jack's other stuff, but didn't stray too far. This new album is for a fan, not a casual listener.

B000YAA68W|5.0|From Pixar down, the general trend in animation over the last few years has been clear. The movement is towards ever more realistic and textured canvases that paint an exquisitely detailed world in glowing shades of pure, pixellated magic. Persepolis, however, is an exception to the rule, a throwback every bit as successful as Aardman's work with clay. This largely black-and-white, defiantly undetailed and sometimes stylised film could have been made at any point since the dawn of cinema, and yet it's a thoroughly modern affair.    An autobiographical tale that was written as a graphic novel, adapted for the screen and then co-directed by its chief character, Marjane Satrapi, this is a highly personal look at a situation of real complexity. Satrapi was six, born into a prosperous Tehran home, when the Iranian Revolution swept away the Shah Of Iran and the country's autocracy was replaced with extremist rule. The war with Iraq that raged for seven years then destroyed much of Iran's wealth, and the subsequent religious crackdowns killed any hope Satrapi and her family had of democratic freedom as well.    The film is at its strongest when examining the turbulent history of Iran through Marjane's eyes. Marjane-as-a-child is one of the most appealing characters in years, happy to embrace new ideas like the latest Igglepiggle and believing herself, briefly, to be a prophet appointed by God. That's not to say that she isn't spoiled, wilful and occasionally cruel - witness Marjane and friends deciding to arm themselves with nails and torture a classmate whose father worked for the secret police. But there's an innocence and exuberance to her schemes that is endlessly charming, and having a child as our guide perfectly pitches the history for those of us who know little about Iran's murky politics. In a sense, the film is the antithesis of most modern animation: where they tell a relatively simple story using complex instruments, this uses very basic tools to tell a storyabout a very complex time.    The film's second act, wherein Marjane grows up alone in Austria and loses her way, is less winning but still involving, a sometimes bleak counterpoint to her earlier optimism. But if that middle section introduces something of a minor note, the tempo picks up again with her return to a transformed, more hardline Iran. Still bolshy, Marjane doesn't fit into that strictly monitored society, but it's in that defiance that she rediscovers her zest for life.     That second half provides a powerful argument that our origins shape who we become - no matter how far we travel. Marjane can't be content in Europe after being sent into exile from her home, but equally can't stomach the restrictions of an Islamic state after being raised in a free Iran and then in Europe. The film is ultimately the story of her quest to find a balance between homeland and freedom, when her nation has failed to do the same. Satrapi's willingness to acknowledge, and make fun of, her own faults makes this a story with real depth, and in these hysterical times, the sight of a young girl standing up to fundamentalist bullies is a vital counterpoint to the West's tendency to tar all Middle Easterns with the same terrorist brush.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The most impressive component of this movie was the marketing and hype machine that labored day and night, whipping the Internet up into a frenzy many, many months before this film was ever released.  (Why is there no featurette about that on the DVD?  I think that would have been a pretty interesting peek behind the curtain.)      The film itself, while occasionally clever, often lapses into long stretches of irritating and repetetive shouting and poor acting.  (Not unlike it's predecessor, The Blair Witch Project.)  I wasn't much bothered by the much-maligned \\"shaky-cam\\" cinematography, though.  It thought it was handled well here and brought a visceral excitement and energy to the whole thing.  (But if you're prone to any kind of motion sickness, you should probably avoid this one.)    It's the lack of a quality script that's the movie's biggest fundamental problem.  In order for a \\"characters in peril\\" movie to work, we have to actually care about the characters.  Which means, they need to be developed and fleshed out into sympathetic and relatable human beings.  That never happens here.  These shallow characters never really deepen.  They start out as petulant, whiny and grating ... and they end up exactly the same way ... only louder and more frantic.  (I suppose it's appropriate that we meet them all at a party in the opening sequence since the small-talk introductions are about as much character work as we get.)  But the problem is, if the audience has a hard time caring about them ... well ... then they're just not gonna care whether those characters live or die.      And if we don't care if they live or die, then we also won't care if they're in any danger.  Which undercuts any potential suspense.    As a result, the movie is reduced to a series of \\"BOO!\\" type scares that wear off shortly after the surprise.  (I enjoyed those moments very much - they're well executed - but I was also amused at how often a 20-story monster was able to sneak up on our heroes!)     On balance, I didn't mind this movie.  There's a nifty creature design and I thought the \\"shaky-cam\\" aesthetic worked well for the movie.  But with a better script and more appealing actors, this could have been a much more satisfying, thrilling and frightening movie experience.

I am in good shape (I just ran a half-marathon two weeks ago), and even the Level One workout is tough for me.  I love how Jillian multi-tasks the strength exercises so that your time is used VERY efficiently. It's easy to follow and the moves are easy to figure out.  I love this video because it's really tough, but because it's over in just 20 minutes, you don't mind!  Jillian also does a good job of encouraging you.

B0011V7P0A|4.0|This past year has really been a banner year for Tom Petty. He has celebrated over 30 years in the music industry, and has delivered classics hits that really have stood the ultimate test of time. He and The Heartbreakers have shown that well with the massive successful performance of the Super Bowl performance back in January, which brought the house down even to a whole new generation of fans. The year has also brought in a new fresh start for his career, with the reunion of the band that started before becoming The Heartbreakers, Mudcrutch and their hit single, Scare Easy. Yet, with all that, it has been 15 years ago since the band released the highly-acclaimed and successful Greatest Hits album. Now, a new version has taken a turn for record listeners, but is it enough to really stand up, or is it just runnin' down the wallet?<br /><br />The 2008 Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Greatest Hits album, re-releases nearly all the tracks that were from the original 1993 edition. The songs have all been well-restored from the groups highs and lows from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The collection includes the classics Learning to Fly, You Got Lucky, the classic Refugee, Runnin' Down A Dream and their first hit American Girl. The collection doesn't completely seperate itself from the 1993 hits album. the only differnce here is that instead of the track Something In the Air, it is replaced with Tom and The Heartbreakers collaboration with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks on their 1981 hit Stop Dragging My Heart Around. On top of that, the album doesn't actually expand into the hits from Tom's 90's era with Warner Brothers on records like Echo, Wildflowers and The Last D.J. So, unfortunately some longtime fans will miss out on good songs like You Don't Know How It Feels, Room At The Top and You Wreck Me will be dissapointed.<br /><br />All in all, While the new version of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers isn't bad still as a single disc collection, there still could've been a bit more than meets the eye.

B000KJTLDI|5.0|Hi,  If you are looking for the Japanese version of this Album, the one with the black \\"art neveau\\" style obi strip; YES, this is it.  Japan- mini LP- Obi strip version /catalog number: TOCP-70143 / EMI Japan.  I clarify this because; Amazon misplaced the image on another Hunky Dory album (label/ Virgin Records Us), and because the catalog number isn't shown on the product detail (as usual), some people looking for this specific album may be confused (as I was).    PD. Great album and excellent sound...but if you are looking for this -Japanese limited edition- you already know that.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I can't speak highly enough about this workout. I first tried it on Exercise TV (on Comcast on Demand), and loved it...but they only offered the first two workouts. I bought the DVD to see what workout 3 was like. Man, it's tough!      But all three workouts are succinct, intense, and they only last 20 minutes! (During the hardest part of the workout, I remind myself that I only have to work hard for a few more minutes and that really helps me to push it out.) Best of all, you'll quickly see results. Since I started doing the Shred, EVERYONE has commented on how great I look or has asked if I've lost weight. The Shred also helped me bounce back from a particularly naughty week in New Orleans and I'll be using it to prep for the beach weekends throughout summer. I haven't logged onto Jillian Michaels' website to get the meal plan (yet), but I'm guessing that would accelerate things.     I've found these workouts to be great for weight maintenance and the moves are easy to follow for those who have a hard time with choreography.  It leaves you looking and feeling more defined.  Workout 2 (which I think is the hardest) is a real waist-nipper.  I love it and would highly recommend the Shred series to anyone who's short on time and/or wants quick results.
B000002HH2|2.0|This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock.  I'm loving Bj&ouml;rk's vocals,  all though over-produced to an inch of her life.  This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic.  Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons.  The LP feels forced.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|I &lt;3 Alan Tudyk. Which was pretty much the only reason I bought the film, but it is genuinely good (for plenty of other reasons). Peter Dinklage is fantastic and I love that the whole film takes place over the course of an afternoon.
B000002HPV|4.0|This collection of tracks is superb.<br />Perfection within the very notes and programming.<br />I love each song on this LP for different reasons.<br />Each song has it's own personality.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Everyone ought to see this film. (Or films). It's a great price for both versions of the film. My only qualm is that both versions are split over 2 DVDs, rather than having one on one and the other on the other. I haven't gone through any features yet, but it looks like there are quite a few...
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|The imagery of the film is NOT necessary to enjoy the pain of this LP.  You will feel masochistic,  but you'll be pleased you cried.  Salty tears will heal the wounds created by this LP.  The scar is stronger than the tissue that was there before the insult.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|The special edition 'Ghost in the Shell' is well done, however in some cases you will need to adjust the sound volume as it is very powerfull and maybe overdone as far as the balance to the effects, to voices. All in all the overal quality is great. I usualy prefer the original language versions but in this case the dub english speaking edition is fine and again done well enough to cover up that fact.There is also a second disc with interesting items and both DVD's have enough options that no mater what system you are running it can be adjusted for optional viewing. A great choice and enough sound power to shake the pictures off you walls.
B000YAA68C|3.0|Ok, I like Hilary, Gerard, Kathy, Lisa, and Harry.  These are great, watchable actors, and I was so excited to see this movie.  That's problem number one- too much hype and expectations.  My little voice kept saying: \\"There's something amiss when the main actor(Gerard Butler) is essentially dead.\\"  Especially for a kind of romantic comedy.  My little voice was somewhat right, but thank goodness for Gerard!  The first half of the movie drags, and you wait and wait only for him to return, and when he does, it's great!    The second problem is I read the reviews beforehand, and it was so up and down in opinions that the voice yelled at me again, \\"Something's afoul.\\"  It turns out there's an edge to the movie's demeanor.  For example, Harry Connick, who should star as a wonderful lead and potential romantic type, is made into a bit of a buffoon, and you're suppose to love him for it?  In one scene, Hilary pulls him into a closet.  He tells her that he has this 'rude syndrome', that he can't filter his words, and that his girlfriend ran away with another woman, and that he was reduced to seeing hookers but now the money's run out.  Ok.  Gosh, I hope you've got enough dough leftover for your HIV tests.    Frankly, the best part of the movie takes place in Ireland.  The scenes with her girlfriends are hilarious, especially in the boat.  Now that's more like the fun escapism one expects in a 'romantic comedy'; however, *SPOILER ALERT* she quickly jumps in bed with another Irishman.  Well, her friends urged her on, and besides, she's lonely and horny and hasn't been with a man for a little while.  He turns out to have been \\"Best mates\\" with Gerard's character.  \\"Hey, we share everything,\\" the new guy says to her after the fact.  Adding, \\"Oh,I didn't mean it like that.\\"  Well, how did you mean it?  And gee, I hope you used good American condoms.*END ALERT*  She returns home to New York and the finale is definitely more satisfying, but to get there has, at times, been a sour process.      Gerard Butler shines in any movie, anytime; Hilary Swank is fine; although, here she must portray a difficult character, who's scattered, flighty and plain annoying at times(Why does she hate her apartment? Her designer E-BAY clothes?  Her all loving, adoring man?) and also, she deals with a script that flounders.  Harry Connick just needs a decent role.  The supporting cast deliver their usual, typical performances.      Whew, so did I enjoy the flick?  I don't know.  I'm not eager to see it again.  I guess I could jump through, and play the scenes I like.  Or not.     My third problem is that I keep imaging a story about a somewhat immature, insecure and opinionated American woman who travels to Ireland and meets a freewheeling Gerard Butler-type and sparks fly, good and bad, but she's not sure what she wants and then a handsome, stud of a Harry Connick-type Amercian shows up and really confuses the whole mess.  And it all plays out to the background of the Emerald Isle and the Big Apple.  Gimmie. Maybe next time?

0525950079|5.0|I read this sequel to Pillars of The Earth right after reading Pillars. Though Pillars was better, in my opinion, this book is still a very powerful read. The characters are so vivid and the multiple story lines so intriguing that I often found myself lying in bed too late on a worknight reading.<br /><br />The only flaw in this sequel is that the characters and storylines too closely mimicked those of Pillars. It became too easy to guess what would happen next because very similiar things had happened in the previous book. Regardless, I would not hesiate to recommend it to anyone who loves strong characters and a well-defined plot.
B00005LOUP|5.0|jim carey does an oscar performance as the grinch. not will it only bring laughter but tears to the eyes. this is one movie you can watch anytime of the year.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This marvelous film is based on \\"Cranford\\" AND two novellas by Gaskell - \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confession\\". Depending upon which edition of Cranford you purchase, these stories may or may not be included. So much for comparing below the plot of the film to the books.    This adaptation is one of the best ever done and ever shown on the BBC or on PBS here in the States.  The acting is beyond first-rate; these actors are so believable, their acting so subtle and yet strong, that one forgets completely that each of the older ladies is an actor of quite a bit of renown.  The Victorian essentials of thwarted romance, disappointed hopes, bonnets and shawls, legacies and runaway brothers, country towns and grand estates, are enriched with priceless moments of poignancy and laugh-out-loud humor.  If I were to say which actresses run away with the show, they are Judi Dench (quite different here from the feisty woman she often plays) and Imelda Staunton, who apparently can take absolutely any role and make it her own.  Lavish  scenes shot on location, plenty of outdoors to breathe in, wonderful costumes and details.  This is well-worth the buying--I was moved to tears, and can't wait to watch it again.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|Wes Anderson became famous to me when he did a credit card commercial with a car blowing up.  It played endlessly and was interesting.  \\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\" was really very boring and awful for me.  It didn't spark.  It wasn't funny.  \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" is much like that film.  Anderson was nominated for an Oscar along with Owen Wilson for \\"The Royal Tenenbaums.\\"  He won a \\"Best Original Screenplay\\" award for this film with Jason Schwartzman from New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed having much of the film set in India.  It gave it a mystical quality.  The featurette on the DVD was interesting to watch how they used Indian artists to paint the train and all of the symbolic meaning to the pictures that one doesn't focus upon within the context of the film.<br /><br />The reason this film didn't work for me was that while it seemed to be trying to go in different directions at the same time, one of those was comedy.  Owen Wilson's Francis had no serious level to his characterization; neither was he funny.  He had energy and was interesting, but seemed mostly odd.  Jason Schwartzman who is the son of Talia Shire from the Rocky movies was most interesting in the short \\"The Hotel Chevalier.\\"  However, while Natalie Portman's lack of dress was interesting, the short prologue film was open-ended with no sense of climax.  Schwartzman's Jack was a self-centered rich kid with hormones.  It seemed like he was playing a sad sack brand of comedy, but it wasn't funny.  Adrien Brody was simply in the wrong movie at the wrong time.  He spent much of his time as Peter wandering around in boxer shorts, abandoning his pregnant wife over issues of commitment.  Perhaps the most interesting thing in the film is when he admits that he got married with the idea that they'd get divorced.  Amara Karan does a nice job as the train's hostess Rita who balances a relationship with the Chief Steward played by Waris Ahluwalia.  These characters brought a sense of story to the film as we seemed to drop in on their relationship at a critical point.  Angelica Huston won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for \\"Prizzi's Honor\\" in 1985.  She was inexplicable in this film, abandoning her kids to help a remote village, not going to her husband's funeral, and then disappearing before anything was resolved.  While the other actors seemed to be trying to be funny, Huston was decidedly dramatic, adding to the completely disjointed feel of the film.  Wallace Wolodarsky who was in \\"Life Aquatic\\" and played Brandon seemed very ordinary.  I did enjoy the two busybody German ladies played by Trudy Mathis & Margot Godros.  They were funny.  Overall, this film didn't work for me on most levels.  Taxi!as we seemed to drop in on their relationship at a critical point.

B00154GEFU|5.0|With this tittle you will wrongly believe that this will be a negative review, but it isn't!! The tittle is a homage to a Steve Howe remark of a very dear song to me from this remarkable album.    Yes, the present indeed destroys all the former conflicts between these four musicians and the big hiatus they went thru together (though I really love John Payne's era and too!!)    This album is really a back to the basis, but it has also a fresh and new proposal. It is a very powerful and meaningful return, but with a more  evolved and smooth sound. Not in vain, Carl Palmer in one of the lattest interview in the Extra - TV Show stated: that this album involves a more mature sound and a sort of Moody Blues fashion.     But don't be affraid with the word smooth!! because there a is a lot of great intense material mixed with a more easy listening prog tracks and flavored with a mystic & romantic trend.    NEVER AGAIN, the first track is an anthem!! and takes you back to the 80's in a time machine,  powered by the memories of your youth and a familiar call to arms in order to make the difference as a real human being.  Howe's introduction riff says to you: I am back!! Hearing John Wetton again sinning with these guys is thrilling..his voice is still great as it was!!..the same for Carl Palmer's drums and percussion..and of course Geoff Downes' unique keyboards!!!       Then, the second track is opened by a great sui generis fanfarre of Geoff Downes that evokes the creative free-format they had in their first album, followed by a light, but good song, in which every one makes their part in order to sings a well known millenary advisory: NOTHING'S FORERVER.           Hearing HEROINE:  Howe's introduction and bridge are really trademarks, as the sweet and melodic voice of Wetton. Downe's keyboards is defenitevly the tapestry the track needed to configure it as a new ASIA romantic song, that deserves to be part of their new live shows. This song remembers me \\"The smile has leftyour eyes\\" a bit.    SLEEPING GIANT / NO WAY BACK / REPRISE, remains me for a moment, at  least the first part,  a TALES FROM A TOPOGRAPHIC OCEAN song (and I am not referring the about the tittle)..but of course in a more easy listening way..this introduction (very progressive, I might add) lead us to a moved  song with a very snapy chorus (No way back!!)..this one for me is like a YES Meets ASIA and the result is beyond good!!     ALIBIS is ASIA!! Howe and Palmer's welcomes you to a rocky-progressive fresh song, with good vocals, very great keyboards and guitar solos, and superb drums!!.    I WILL REMEBER YOU is one of those good songs with a melancolic touch that bring us back memories of former and classical works as \\"My own Time\\" and \\"Ryde Easy\\".    SHADOWS OF A DOUBT is like ALIBIS, plainly can be defined as a rocky song with a characteristical ASIA romantic oriented touch!    This three part song: PARALLEL WORLDS / VORTEX / DEYA is a very good example of evolution.  Combines the wonders of these four guys's instrumental virtuosity.  The first song starts as an another great reflexive-melodic ASIA style song,  but suddenly in the latter ones, something happen (without breaking the continuity of the whole track).. an instrumental and powerful partnerhip emerge from Howe, Palmer and Downes, to then be ended with a Howe's romantic guitar solo and a 60's melancolic european well made sound played by Downes.    As I formrely qouted, Steve Howe's song: WHISH I'D KNOW ALL ALONG is one of my favorites. I really love the lyrics...and the music..and of course how Steve plays here!!!                    ORCHARD OF MINES and OVER AND OVER are the red light ahead that the album is near to end, and are more smooth, romantics and calm tracks..with more modern arrangements.. good ones too..not to be underestimated!!    AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE is a great, but great way to end this album..recaps John's Wettons insides about life and death (after his recent emergency heart surgeryduring the 2007 ASIA tour)..and it is also a powerful and meaningful anthem..one of those great prog rock bands used to sing before the decay of the real rock culture into the current cult of modern vaccumness sponsored by a MTV psuedo-oriented art!!      Hope you will find this review useful!!!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was prepared for disappointment simply because Beatle covers usually are less than great. This film presented a smaltzy but fun story line, and the visual effects and music were terrific! Joe Cocker was an amazing character. The scenes of peace rallies and wild parties were caracitures, but what isn't these days. It was simply a lot of fun.
B000065V9Y|4.0|It is astonishing to me that Amazon selected the fairly negative review by Rob Stewart as their editorial choice for this record...\\"Us\\" is surely in Gabriel's top 4.  After \\"3/melt\\" and \\"Security,\\" \\"Us\\" may be a tie for 3rd with his pop masterpiece \\"So,\\" though it depends on mood; \\"Us\\" feels a bit more experimental than the brilliant pop of \\"So.\\"      As with most of Gabriel's studio records, it's a concept record, and the concept here is relationships.  The songs chronicle the breakdown of a relationship, namely Gabriel's marriage and divorce, and the subsequent emotional and psychological journey he experiences.  It begins with Come Talk to Me, written about his daughter's struggle with her parents' marital breakdown.  Then there is a contiguous narrative set of songs about the frustrations, longings, complexities, passion and pain of relationships in general, and male-female in particular(Love to Be Loved, Blood of Eden, Only Us, and Steam--this last one may or may not have to do with sex as often suggested, but Gabriel himself said it was about a relationship between someone projecting a cultured, educated persona and the guy who had the frustration of knowing what she really was like).  Then there is the need to eventually let go of all the baggage and be renewed (Washing of the Water).  That leads nicely into what I think is an ingenious metaphor for therapy, which Gabriel was going through at the time(the stunning Digging in the Dirt, which Gabriel said was about dealing with our violent impulses).  Then there is the upbeat romp about finding new love when you're \\"past your prime\\" and feeling old n' ugly, and hoping she'll see you're a good guy (Kiss that Frog); and a beautiful epic summary reflection on the tragedy that is a failed marriage (Secret World).  There's also the trademark Gabriel socio-political reflection, this one a brooding worldbeat meditation on the possibility of change(14 Black Paintings).      Musically, it is not incorrect to compare thesound of the record with \\"So,\\" as some have done here, but it's not quite as accessible as \\"So.\\"  Although, Gabriel nicely melded his accessible \\"pop\\" sound with his more experimental spirit here.  The arrangements are all solid; the sheer consistency of one good song after another throughout the record causes it to rise the top of his other work.  Secret World and Digging in the Dirt are simply two of the best songs of his career (along with runner-up gems like the poignant, Gospel-inspired meditation Washing of the Water).  Some of Tony Levin's cleverest bass work with Gabriel is on this record, along with some of Gabriel's most clever instrumental arrangements, and some of his most insightful and touching lyrics.  Personally, it may be my favorite in his catalog.  I could only give it 4 stars because \\"3/Melt\\" and \\"Security\\" get 5.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|I've always thought of Chuck Billy as the most underrated vocalist in metal music. I've been a Testament fan for 20+ years and one thing I can say about this band is they never sold out and they never released a bad album - unlike some other top metal bands I could mention but won't. When I heard The Gathering in '99 I wondered how they were ever going to top the heaviness and brutality of that album. I don't think that was what they intended to do with Formation of Damnation but I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this album is heavy. Chuck Billy is well....he's Chuck Billy all the way. This album is metal the way metal is supposed to be done. A couple things that kept me from giving it five stars were the almost laid back guitar solos and the rather unimpressive drum tracks. Alex Skolnick seems to have mellowed over the years which isn't surprising considering the jazzy solo material he has been doing. I was hoping to hear him cut loose and shred on this album but he doesn't. And nothing against Paul Bostaph's drumming but I thought he could have added a little more than he did. Overall however, Formation of Damnation is a worthy comeback for a band that has been gone far too long. I definitely plan to go see them live if and when they are in the area.
1594489505|2.0|I have read this book and The Kite Runner, and found them both quick and easy reads.  However, they are also overly sentimental, and not particularly realistic.  The characters don't ring true.  This probably reflects the fact that the author is writing about a place that he only half-remembers from early childhood, and describing events, cities, and people that he has never really known.  The author's family had left Afghanistan by the time he was 12, after already spending years abroad.  Between this and the Kite Runner, the scenes that rang the truest were those set in Fremont, California, near where the author grew up.    So would I recommend these books?  Well, they are entertaining pulp fiction, but they do not help the reader understand Afghani culture, and they are mired in maudlin stereotypes.  They may do a disservice to some readers, who believe them to be more \\"true\\" than they are.  So I would recommend them only as entertainment, and even then I would be wary.
B000UR9T7I|3.0|When I saw \\"Spider-Man 3\\" on opening night, I was really let down. How could a film with great-looking villains, amazing special effects, and Peter turning to the dark side, be bad? Well, for one thing, as great as the villains and special effects looked, they lacked heart and soul. As for Peter becoming more hostile and evil, the filmmakers decided to make a joke out of it and the whole storyline lost its punch. Also, by adding more, useless Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn drama, the story became bloated, routine, and at times, boring. \\"Spider-Man 3\\" was the weakest of the trilogy.     After finally watching the film for a second time, I found the film slightly more tolerable(mainly because I knew what I was in for). It still contained the same problems though. First, the storyline is filled with too many stories that are connected in totally unbelievable ways. Second, even though the audience has been close with the characters the last two films, Peter Parker, M.J. Watson, and others seem very one-dimensional here. Finally, when the film should have been serious, it opted for a more funny tone (which, ironically, I found not funny at all). Even though I have my complaints about the film, there are many parts that I did enjoy, mainly the special effects and fight scenes, James Franco's and Thomas Haden Church's performances, and in my opinion, the greatest scene of the trilogy, the creation of Sandman. These aspects elevate the film from being a waste of time.     Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is loving life. He has the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), he's doing well in school, and most importantly, his alter-ego, Spider-Man is finally being revered for all his hard work. Regardless of all the good things happening to him, there is still a lot he needs to deal with.     First, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), knows he is Spider-Man and still places the death of his father in the web-slinger's hands. Harry eventually dons anew version of the Goblin suit, hoping to get revenge.    Second, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual killer of Peter's loving uncle, escapes prison and ends up falling into a science experiment that turns him into the Sandman.     Third, M.J. begins to move away from Peter to Harry. After her show does poorly and she's fired from the role, she begins to dislike Peter because of the success he is receiving as Spider-Man. When M.J. turns to Harry, Harry decides to use to his advantage to make Peter miserable.     Four, an alien symbiote lands on Earth and similar to a parasite, uses Peter's suit as a host. When he dons his new black suit, he becomes more powerful, but at the same time, more aggressive and volatile. Once he finally gets rid of the symbiote, it finds a new host: Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes supervillain, Venom.     Five...Six...Seven...Eight...The script is a mess. Besides what I mentioned above, there are many other stories in the film that deal with both Peter and Spider-Man. The main issue I have with the script is that it consists of coincidences. It's a coincidence that Spider-Man is fighting the villain, Sandman, who also happened to kill Peter Parker's uncle. It's a coincidence that the alien symbiote from space landed ten feet away from Peter instead of somewhere else on the planet. It's a coincidence that when Spider-Man rips himself free of the symbiote, his rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock, is right below him in some random church and then becomes Venom. Once he's Venom, it's a coincidence he knows that M.J. is Peter's love interest even though he's never seen her or the two together before. \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is ridded with all these situations that are unbelievable in terms of story and make the film much longer than needed.     Maybe I'm being a tad harsh. After all, the film is based off a comic book. Yet, this doesn't excuse the poorly written characters. The audience has already learned and cared a lot about Peter Parker and M.J, but the third film does nothing new with them. Even though they are together, they are still having tough times to work things out, which I find quite annoying. At the end of \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" M.J. knew what she was getting into by being with Peter and how he wouldn't always be around for her physically. In this film, she pouts and whines, because Peter is never there for her, making the ending to the great \\"Spider-Man 2\\" look pointless. I wished that in this chapter they would have just been a happy couple and had M.J. more in the background of the story.     In a superhero film, the villains are usually the most interesting and the fun part of the film is when our hero fights them. The problem with \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is that the villains are similar to their characters on a comic book page: flat. As cool as both of the main villains are, they lack any depth or real characterization. All the audience knows about Sandman is that he killed Uncle Ben and now he searches for money to help his daughter get better from some sickness. That's it. The most hurtful part of the film is that the coolest villain in the Spider-man universe, Venom, gets reduced to fifteen minutes of screen time. What's even worse is that he doesn't have a long tongue or a muscular body frame like the comics, but instead looks like black Spider-Man with a mouth like a raptor and a face that changes from the raptor mouth to Eric Foreman's face...I mean, Eddie Brock's face. Venom is just there. There's no real purpose for him to be in the story. If I had had my way, I would have let the ending of this one be Brock changing into Venom. That way, Sandman would have more time to develop as a character and then Venom could have his own film with Spider-Man. By throwing too many villains into the pot, the film suffers.     My final problem with the film is the humor placed throughout. In the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" films, I laughed with the film when intentional, but in \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" I foundmyself laughing at what was happening on screen. Peter's transformation to the dark side is what I'm referring to. What should have been a serious moment in the film becomes incredibly stupid. For instance, when he walks down the street, he breaks out into dance and \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" type moves. It's really embarrassing. As I watched that scene, I cringed, wanting it to be over as fast as I could, but it goes on for a good five minutes unfortunately. Other \\"funny\\" moments throughout take the viewer out of the film, especially at the moments when the viewer is supposed to be most engaged in what's going on.     Now, I can finally get on to what I did like about the film. First, the special effects are dazzling. If anything has improved throughout all the films, it's the effects. Sure, Spider-Man is still a computer's creation when slinging around New York, but he felt much more believable this time around. Second, the action scenes are well-done and plentiful. None are overlong (even though, Venom's should have been), but they are well shot and edited, especially the Sandman and Spider-Man fight in the underground. Third, the performances by James Franco and Thomas Haden Church are top-notch. While the film suffers from bad writing, these two are the only actors that truly make the most of it. Franco brings a much-needed warmth and charm to the film and his character stands out the most. Even though Sandman isn't a well-developed character, Church really makes the most out of it, which brings me to the best part of the film: the creation of Sandman.     Watching grains of sand slowly come together to form Flint Marko is a spectacle. Even though it's totally unrealistic, the special effects team along with the help of Thomas Haden Church, make the scene believable. As Marko tries to form, he stumbles and chunks of sand fall away. Once he realizes what he's becomes, his face of sand changes expressions and with the aid of Christopher Young's score, the scene is just beautiful and breath-taking. It's my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. If the film had more scenes that had great special effects balanced with heart, then it would have been amazing.     Overall, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is the weakest of the trilogy. It was the one I was looking forward to the most, but was let down due to the script, characters, and the humor. Thankfully, the special effects, action, a few performances, and the creation of a villain were able to make it a better film and redeem it from being a waste of celluloid.
1430300612|4.0|I read this in combination with Marvin Minsky's \\"The Society of Mind\\" and noted that there are some very interesting parallels between theory and reality.      I thought there was a bit of repetition throughout the book but that is her narrative style.  Aside from that if you are interested in the human mind, how the author's stroke helps to define the systematic break down of the brain and the corresponding trip to recovery - I highly recommend this book.    In addition to her story I also found fascinating the aspects of her recovery especially with her description of the interactions that she had to face on a day to day basis with those around her.  The final part of the book deals with these interactions and may help those who have a family member who has suffered a stroke.    This book made me again realize how fragile our existance really is.
B0019CSXAM|4.0|PLEASE NOTE: This review contains SPOILERS.<br /><br />I've been a fan of How I Met Your Mother from Day One, so I don't use a phrase like \\"starting to slip a little\\" lightly.  But the fact is, season three just doesn't quite measure up to the previous two.<br /><br />The main problem, as I see it, is that the writers felt the need to create ongoing conflict between the core group of friends.  Sure, conflict is necessary to keep things interesting.  But I think the ensemble in this show is better served by external conflicts (e.g., Barney and Ted's various problems with the opposite sex, Marshall's work-related stress, etc.).  Watching Ted and Robin try to one-up each other after a painful breakup last season was. . .well, not that funny.  Later in the season, Ted and Barney's friendship was on the rocks.<br /><br />Otherwise, there were plenty of well-written and funny shows.  Here's a few highlights:<br /><br />\\"Slapsgiving\\" pays off the long-running joke from last season's \\"Slap Bet.\\"<br />\\"We're Not From Here\\" allows Barney and Ted to cut loose, posing as out-of-towners.<br />\\"How I Met Everyone Else\\" introduces us to a classic Barney Stinson gimmick: The Crazy/Hot Scale.<br />\\"Ten Sessions\\" introduces Ted's major love interest Stella (Sarah Chalke), probably his most memorable girlfriend since season one's Victoria.  His manic (and successful) attempt at a two-minute date is probably the high point of the season.<br />\\"Sandcastles in the Sand\\" brings back Robin Sparkles. . .and culminates in an ending so shocking, you'll be grateful you don't have to wait another week to see what comes next.<br /><br />I guess it's fair to say the good outweighs the not-so-good in season three.  At its heart, How I Met Your Mother is the longest tease in television history (yet a few tantalizing clues as to the identity of \\"mother\\" are dropped this year).  I hope they can keep it fresh awhile longer, even though the inherent illogic of its premise (just how long have Ted's kids been sitting on that couch listening to Bob Saget?) may soon start weighing heavily even on fans like myself.soon start weighing heavily even on fans like myself.
0060558121|4.0|American Gods by Neil Gaiman is at times utterly fascinating and mind-numbingly boring.  The story follows the adventures of ex-convict Shadow.  Shadow is released from prison a day early, because his wife has died.  Along with his wife's death is a death to all the plans he had when getting out of prison.  With no real direction in mind he hooks up with Mr. Wednesday.  Wednesday is on a quest to stir up all the old gods for a battle against the new gods.  This is where Gaiman is his most inciteful.  His examination of American culture's obsessive ways creating in essence a type of religion of it's own.  For a good portion of the book Shadow just seems to blunder around trying to figure out what it is that Wednesday wants him to do.  This book works in little vignettes of exploration of American culture, but as a whole it becomes jumbled.  I found those slices of brilliance were enough to get me through the plodding portions.
B000YENUI6|3.0|Great picture of the russian mafia and russian culture in the US.  Some extremely violent scenes. Deep immersion into a parrallel world.    A little frustration that some subjects are not completely covered and the story remains somewhat pending ...    Naomi Watts ok but Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings) is amazing and totally transformed !

0374280967|5.0|Since reading this book, I have purchased 3 copies to give to friends.  I love books that are unique and well written and this one certainly fits the bill.  If you're looking for a story that immediately grabs your attention, that is short (my sister read it on the plane from Phoenix to San Francisco)and, has a an ending that is sure to bring a smile, by all means get a copy.[[ASIN:0374280967 The Uncommon Reader: A Novella]]
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|\\"Be Myself Again\\" and \\"The Queen is Back\\" make this cd a Five Star. Two masterpieces that should become instant classics. Very different from each other, the first, a beautiful and very profound ballad and the second a fun, hip-hop-dance tune that makes you want to get up and dance. They both have: The right words, the right music and magnificent vocals. PERFECT! The rest of the cd is a lot of fun with many different sounds....for all generations.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I love movies of all genres, especially musicals.  Perhaps I needed to drop a little acid to understand what was going on?  Needless to say, I wasted quite a bit of time watching most of the movie, but I ended up turning it off before it was over.
B00133KFGW|4.0|Freddie Highmore does an outstanding job in his performance in August Rush. The story plot is portrayed in a believable series of events and Robin Williams also does a good job portraying the semi-villain in this movie. This is a bit of a tear-jerker but pleasant none-the-less and with the inevitable happy ending.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Nightwish is still at the top of its genre despite losing its sensational vocalist Tarja Turunen. This Finnish band's been so remarkable in the last decade because of the very successful albums such as Oceanborn, Wishmaster, Century Child and Once. After breaking up with their vocalist, they found a new one, Anette Olzon, who is from a little known but very talented band called Alyson Avenue.<br /><br />Anette's vocal style is completely different than the previous one so the music of Nightwish changes quite a lot, still symphonic and now hardrock. Some may not like it but sure many will love the new Nightwish.<br /><br />The music and lyrics written by Tuomas, Marco and Emmpu still deserves five star and makes this album one of the best of the year 2007. My favourites in this album are; Amaranth, Bye Bye Beautiful, The Poet And The Pendulum, The Islander, Whoever Brings The Night, Seven Days To The Wolves and Eva. The other songs are also fair enough.<br /><br />So, if you liked the old Nightwish, you must buy this album and see how they evolved, and if you didn't like the old Nightwish but you like hardrock, you must buy this album to have another favourite band of yours...
B00001OH7T|3.0|Bowie's `Young Americans' is an album that I bought for one reason only; it was a David Bowie album from the 70's, his most important era. Otherwise, I would have no interest in a blue-eyed soul record. For that reason alone is `Young Americans' worth the price of purchase because there is no way on God's green earth I would buy a soul record. Yes the title track is a classic as is \\"Fame\\" but they are far from my favorite Bowie songs. I actually like \\"Across the Universe\\" (both this and \\"Fame\\" featuring John Lennon!) better than the Beatles version which I'm sure is heresy but I am not a big Beatles fan. \\"Can You Hear Me\\" has appeared on various compilations but I'm not crazy about this one either. The performances, by yet another new band including Carlos Alomar and Luther Vandross, are stunning but again.....I don't like Hall and Oates or the O'Jays so who cares! Songs on David's previous album had hinted at this soul direction and the subsequent tour and live album betrayed much of this seemingly new enthusiasm but no one expected a selling of the \\"soul\\" on an entire record! I just can't give this album a high grade because I just flat out don't enjoy it. `Station to Station'? Well, that's another story!
B000ZN802W|4.0|First and foremost, the scenery, story, and acting in this movie is top-notch.  From Sean Penn's vision of how Christopher McCandless lives his life and searched for his goal, to Emile Hirsch's protrayal of the man's life, it's very compelling.<br /><br />As for the movie, Christopher (Hirsch) is a young man with the hubris of youth, the free-spirit of someone without responsibility, and the wherewithal of a privileged family.<br /><br />Because of a slightly dysfuncational family life, a strong disdain for much of what contemporary society has become - something with which I can strongly related, and the desire to find the aesthetic quality in every day life, Christopher leaves it all behind.  He eschews money (he actually sets fire to his last few remaining dollars), possession, and just about every other modern convenience in search of<br /><br />Along the way he changes his name to Alexander Supertramp in honor of not only the lifestyle but also his desire for anonymity.  His voyage to Alaska was full of adventure, finding random jobs, kayaking the entire Grand Canyon into Mexico, and meeting some interesting people along the way.<br /><br />Eventually he finds an abandoned school bus and calls it home.  It's just enough shelter for him to make it base-camp, where he can forage and hunt small game.  He spends the rest of the time reading, writing, and reflecting.<br /><br />The first major problem I have with this movie is the fact that he was so nice to so many, but had such an irrational hatred of his family.  I can understand his hesitancy to be close to his father, but he tortured his mother and sister out of pure ignorance and selfishness.<br /><br />The second problem I have with the movie is the message.  The majority of the film is a buildup, a message, an insight into his joy and freedom.  And then, in the end, the message changes.  Not only was his original concept foolhardy, but the lesson he learned was that he was completely wrong.  The essence of what he wanted to escape from was eventually the precise thing he craved.  It's easy to picture Alexander Supertramp as the free-wheeling, nature-loving, soul on a quest for enlightenment if he didn't end up looking like a utterly naïve young man who lost his life unnecessarily.y the precise thing he craved.

0452289963|4.0|I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding peace and happiness. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was disappointed to find a lot of repeat material from the author's earlier awesome book [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]]. (I do see how the Power of Now ideas fit in with A New Earth.)    Although some of the concepts are hard to grasp and are beyond me, the author's formula for creating a new earth consciousness is clear enough that anyone can benefit from it if they take the time. I greatly appreciate the simplicity of the practices he describes.     I revisit the many highlighted (by me) passages from both books nearly everyday and still find them interesting and helpful. Eckhart Tolle rocks!

0756404746|5.0|A very well written novel.  Colorful, clever writing that puts a new twist on an old fantasy tale.  I've been reading fantasy since I was 8 and I would recommend this in the top 10.  This writer can definitely evoke images with his writing.
B000002JSJ|4.0|OK. Alright. This album gets a lot of abuse because it is a Zeppelin album.  Perhaps because of Physical Graffiti's monumental scope and breadth, fans were expecting...mmm...perhaps something even greater?  Well,  Presence gave them something different for a change.  A curve ball.        I get the feeling that the fans most let down by this LP were probably  those who leaned more towards progressive rock.  Aside from the first  track, the rest of the album is just balls-out rock 'n' roll.    It is really good rock 'n' roll.  Kind of like Grease meets Led Zeppelin  only much harder.  For those who can't stomach the Elvis Presley or  Fats Domino, well, I sympathise.  But, then again, maybe those fans  don't appreciate where rock music came from or perhaps they are not  really even fans of the blues or rock at all.  Because this album rocks.  No doubt about it.  From start to finish.    It is not an award-winning or ground-breaking album by any means.  However, when this reviewer first heard it way-back-when and up until  the present,  I noticed I can't stop tapping my feet to the beat whenever  I listen to it.     I'm not going to go into all the songs because the album works well as   a whole.  The only song I will point out, as everybody else has done, is  the epic Achilles Last Stand which is like a precursor or prog metal  or something like it.  Probably could have been worked on a bit more,  but still very impressive playing and singing by the band.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent SFX, excellent acting. I've been an avid Batman comic fan for years and this movie does the dark knight the most justice. Batman in the comic books is a dark character and more of an anti-hero. No sugar-coated stuff in this movie, it's back to basics with \\"Batman Begins\\". Love the ending of the film...Commisioner Gordon tells Batman \\"I never did thank you\\"...Batman cuts him short and retorts \\"and you'll never have to\\"...Priceless.
0805079831|1.0|In \\"Shock Doctrine,\\" I nod my head in agreement of many of Klein's ideas- namely that deliberately creating or relishing in disaster to pursue corporate interests or to exploit a country's resources is horrifically unethical.<br /><br />So what's the problem then?<br /><br />Klein makes a strawman's argument against a phantom opponent, whose ideas don't resemble anything Friedman actually believed or wrote.  This would be obvious to anybody who actually read his works, in which he makes a case for individual liberty free of government intrusion, elimination of government handouts for corporations, and and organized democratic process that reflects the will of the people, while maintaining individual rights. Friedman never said that the fall of Communism should call for any foreign intervention to implement capitalism. He said that the failure of Communism RESULTED from the fact that people preferred to take control of the individual liberties that Communism once denied them. It was descriptive of the past, never prescriptive for the future. Klein gets the whole order reversed.<br />Milton decried imperialist takeoevers, corporate theft, or governments usurping power. To Friedman understood that excessive central power tends to disproportionately trample on the rights of the poor.  Friedman was suspicious of tyranny in all its forms, and believed that a government that gave special benefits to businesses (such as in eminent domain), over the property rights of the people, was despotic.<br /><br />And saying that Friedman was happy with Katrina because afterwards individuals got to choose their schools is like saying that someone would be happy that his dad dies, because afterward he makes sure to keep his health in check. Katrina was just one horrific example of how the government failed people. And criticizing the effectiveness of government, or the people demanding change after such a tragedy hardly constitute as celebrating the tragedy.<br />(It so happens, that according to polls, the parents and children in the new charter LA schools LOVE them, because they are now empowered to choose and control their education, rather than be forced to suffer the same garbage education the government usually imposes on poor kids).<br /><br />Friedman believed that all actions should be voluntary and consensual, and that taking resources that belongs to the people of a particular region is nothing less than brutal theft.<br /><br />All I ask for readers of this book is to read \\"Free to Choose\\" by Friedman. Then decide if you think he was fairly represented in this sloppily researched book. If you still believe Klein's interpretation Friedman's ideas are correct, so be it, but I highly doubt you will.nts and children in the new charter LA schools LOVE them, because they are now empowered to choose and control their education, rather than be forced to suffer the same garbage education the government usually imposes on poor kids).

B000FGGE7C|3.0|Movie has some cheesy CGI special effects especially the motorcycle scene. Milla Jovovich looks great and her hand-to-hand action sequences are worth seeing (she's a real-life black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu). Entertaining movie if you have a couple of hours to kill (but please leave your brain at the door before you start watching the movie).
1577312082|3.0|i have mixed emotions about this product.  i love the message, but i am not crazy about the messenger.  excellent teachings and advice. the problem is they got the author to read it. maybe they should have gone with an actor or a singer.  the author's voice is an annoying monotone and it has little to no projection to it. this makes it difficult to understand what he is saying and i have to crank my cd player up and often rewind to listen to parts i couldn't understand the first time through. this can be annoying and disrupts any continuity in listening.again-i love the message, but perhaps this item is best if dealt with in a book format.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Not a big review here.    This is the first album I've heard in a while that is definitely an album and not a series of songs. One thing that makes this an album, oddly enough, is that some of the songs aren't the greatest. Of course, this is offset by numerous wonderful songs. Some of the songs will do more for you than they did for me, and vice-versa; I didn't like Hollow Man, but that seems to be a fan favorite. This album is worth $10. Maybe not the list price, but certainly $10.
B0001VTPWM|3.0|The first two Robocop movies were outstanding sci-fi/action adventure films.  Which is why I couldn't believe a 3rd film had been made that I had never heard of.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this video!! Jillian is AWESOME!! I had a baby 18 months ago and have been fighting to lose the last 10-15 lbs. I had a gym membership but was not able to go because of childcare complications. I LOVE Biggest Loser and was so happy to see Jillian's girl win this year. I thought I would check out her video and see about working out at home. I have never tried at home stuff before but I figured all I had to lose was 12 bucks or the last 10lbs. It kicked my [well, you know]...but the weight just started falling off. In just ONE weeks time the compliments were rolling in! After 20 minutes with her I was sweating more, and more sore the next day, then 2 hours at the gym!!!! It sounds crazy but I am canceling my membership to the gym because I found something that REALLY works! Yes, it is hard work, but the results come in so fast that you hardly have time to give up. You are rewarded right away!!     I have to say, I haven't changed my eating habbits while doing this and I am still loosing weight. I am sure I would be more successful if I was committed to a diet change too. I have never eaten poorly, I just was not putting out as many calories as was going in. If you eat healthy food, and even treat yourself now and then, you hardly have to change your eating style to lose with this video. I listen to Jillian on KFI on Sundays now and then and she reccomends Googleing \\"BMR\\" and using their calculator to find out how many calories you (personally) need in a day. It will tell you how many you need to maintain your weight and how many to lose weight. If your a calorie counter this is a great resource.      I HIGHLY reccomend this video. It is worth FAR more then they charge. It also comes with a free 30-day membership on her website. I have not signed up for that yet so I cannot review it but I love her and know that she doesn't mess around. She offers a custom work out and diet plan for you as well as the emotional support you will need to get through this.     Theonly advice I would give, if you have not been active for a while and know that you are prone to injury in certain areas (for me it is my knees) this is high enough intensity that you need to be thinking about keeping those areas from injury. I was in my living room so I didn't wear shoes (first mistake) and I should have taped my knees and taken glucosamine for my joints before starting. I ended up with an injury, but that was my fault, not the videos. Just know that she is in this to shred you so you better come prepared! YOUR GONNA LOVE IT!

B0010X745K|1.0|Well, not a fan of a warm and fuzzy ending but I am a fan of leaving an original work just that, original... Stephen King is the master for a reason.  He builds strong characters and usually, not always, creates an atmosphere that gets the audience to participate a bit. It is my opinion and mine alone that father would have given his own life first, to save his friends and son.  I am a huge fan of the story and was very excited to not only see this come to film but buy it so I could watch it over and over again.  Needless to say, I was very, very, very dissapointed and I wondered what Stephen King thought?  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?   I understand what the director's reasons were, I just think he overshot the ending...
B000WQWPKA|2.0|Reviews of the movie aside, I was disappointed to see that the transfer of this movie to Blu-Ray actually \\"jitters\\" up and down--and not just the earthquake-ish scenes where its supposed to do that. With a 1080 122\\" screen, it's painfully evident: you can pause the movie and watch the entire picture bob up and down two or three pixels by scanning forward frame-by-frame. The shot where the shadow crosses the World Trade Center is a big offender, but you can even see it during the closing credits. It's almost as if the projector that was used to do the transfer couldn't hold the picture steady from one frame to the next. I have another 20th Century Fox movie that does this during the opening Fox fanfare (Ice Age), but the movie itself is perfectly fine since each frame there is computer animated. Movies from other distributors seem to be fine, but watching this one on a large home theater screen can quickly get annoying.
B00102F5WK|1.0|The most complimentary comment I can make about this film, is that its only a fair portrayl of the ambiguities of asymmetrical warfare of the kind, which the West / US is confronted by the Islamic Terrorists.  It is no doubt a very difficult war to fight, because of such ambiguity.      However... this film suffers from the extreme adulteration and distortion of the facts and truth, and documented evidence surrounding the War on Terror, which is incessantly purveyed by the \\"anti-American, radical left\\" of both Hollywood and our Major Media.      What otherwise would be an interresting portrayl of the realities of asymmetrical warfare, devolves into nothing more than obvious \\"political commentary and propaganda\\" by its writers, directors and producers, who incessantly \\"hawk such drivel\\" to the ignorant, and uninformed \\"great unwashed.\\"    It suggests that: water-boarding, beating, nude interrogation, and isolation are \\"torture\\" of islamic terrorists - which they most definitely are not (not to mention that the Geneva Convention is not at all applicable to non-uniformed, unofficial combatants); the US has illegally spyed on US citizens, spirited them away to interrogation camps, and \\"tortured\\" them in the conduct of the War on Terror.      Of course, despite their attempts to portray otherwise, regardless of the facts, there has never been any evidence uncovered, reported, or presented that any agency of the US government has spyed on, or wire-tapped, US citizens, nor actually \\"tortured\\" US citizens, nor \\"tortured\\" any type of combatant in the War on Terror.  There was no actual \\"torture\\" of terrorits conducted at Abu Ghraib Prison - only humiliation - humiliation is not \\"torture.\\"  And of course, as were learning now, as the charges have been dropped, there were never any \\"illegal killings, and war attrocities\\" that occured at Haditha, or elsewhere (though, obviously there have been innocent civilians killed, during firefights with the terrorists - that can not be avoided).      This film offends your intelligence... that is... if you, actually, are intelligent and well-informed.    If so... pass this one up.      If not... you'll never know the difference anyway.
0743289692|5.0|I raced through this autobiography by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  It is well written.  Ms. Ali introduces the reader to Islam through the context of her life, rather than using a dry journalistic or didactic method.  In many ways, this book is not easy reading.  It is graphic but not gratuitous.  The book for me was an eye-opener.
B00062ZE44|5.0|Sharon is the best singer/performer I have ever seen.  Since WT doesn't tour the US much get the CD and DVD. You won't be dissapointed.  I liked all the tracks except for one which had some male growling (beauty beast). I actually like one of the beauty beast tracks called Candles.  Usually I skip any such song, but I like that one.   Most songs are melodic with Sharon doing wonderful vocal work.    I liked this CD so much I didn't listen to Mother Earth (Which I bought at the same time as Silent Force) for a while.  Mother Earth is really a good CD too.    Also check out Sharon singing the \\"The Promise\\" (From Mother Earth) live on Youtube.  The Live at Taubertal 2003 version is excellent.  This is as close to heaven as you are going to find here on earth.  The astounding thing is you can watch almost any WT video on Youtube and they are all well done.  Sharon and the band just don't make many mistakes.    I personally prefer Silent Force and Mother Earth to The Heart of   Everything.  The vocals on the Heart of Everything seem more processed and less natural to me.  I hope the band returns to the  Silent Force / Mother Earth Style.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Absolutely mesmerizing.  Other reviewers have already stated the beauty of this DVD/CD set, and I agree completely.  The DVD of the concert in Tuscany is almost surreal.  The man is an amazing talent and his duets with the other performers are wonderful.  Do yourself a big favor and buy this DVD/CD set.  You won't regret it.
B000002JEV|4.0|I absolutely  love early Led Zeppelin, especially with regards to their live material when it still reflected their blues influence. This recording makes very good use of space while documenting an important transitional time in their career, ie You Shook Me through Stairway to Heaven. My most favorite part of the album is John Paul Jone's contributions. His organ and bass work really carry the band. He was extremely underrated for his ability. My biggest gripe about this disc is something that stands out sooo much, but isn't discussed, which is overdubbing. While Traveling Riverside Blues is excellent and many here agree, it has many overdubs over the open slide part, ie. solo at the end. Other tracks have them as well, but not as overbearing as \\"On Stage\\" by Chuck Berry, \\"Got Live if you Want it\\" by The Stones or \\"Skull and Roses\\" by the Grateful Dead. Overall, its a great album, but just be aware that even the best have to add a little extra to spice it up.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I often find myself missing music by the Beatles, and I think it is because there are so few good or innovative covers of classic songs.  This album solved the problem for me.  Dana Fuchs and Jim Studrgess in particular have voices that bring joy to listening to these long-familiar songs.  Long overdue!
0307265730|3.0|I just finished Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri. I loved the first story and the last story, which is presented in three parts. I was not thrilled with everything in between, though they were interesting. The other six stories in their own ways, felt forced and as if the cultural differences were just a catalyst for the story, not the actual story. They did not have the masterfully written prose and the beautifully thought-provoking themes I thought the first and last stories had.<br /><br />Lahiri masterfully uses imagery, symbolism and words to create an `outside looking in' type of feel to her stories. Though I may not have enjoyed the middle stories as much as the first and last, I would recommend this book to others. I found myself picking up the book to read a few paragraphs when I had a few moments to spare. I found myself really thinking about the issue presented in the first story for several days after finishing it; and I was deeply saddened by the ending of the last story. The most powerful stories in this collection `Unaccustomed Earth' and `Hema and Kaushik' were stories of the heart.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Put off seeing this after all its original rave reviews because the plot seemed boring. boy in italy learns about cinema. well, good reviews were justified. i never get tired of this film and watch at least once a year. great character development and follows almost the entire life of a famous italian film maker. beautiful and a sweet insight into a boy's/man's heart, and life in pre and post war Sicily.
1592332803|5.0|I am admittedly not vegan, although I admire the lifestyle choice. I discovered the world of vegan desserts because my children have several food allergies. I couldn't stand the thought of them not enjoying baked goods, particularly since I have always enjoyed baking. That said, I must admit that a lot of non-dairy, non-egg attempts at baking some classic desserts were awful, yielding what I thought was worthy of nothing but the trash can. This cookbook has changed that and opened my eyes to the possibilities of vegan baking. I even like some of the vegan versions better than the dairy laden versions. I am so surprised at the negative reviews about the lack of healthy ingredients - these are desserts people!!  The best desserts usually rely on rich ingredients and it is already a vast improvement that there are no eggs or milk. If you want healthy sweets go for a granola bar or a bowl of fruit. The occasional dessert treat should be just that and it should be decadent enough to make it worth eating. It seems unfair to give a negative review based on a criteria that the author is not aspiring to. Great job Colleen!!
0786838655|3.0|I bought this book because I like fantasy and I LOVE Harry Potter, thought it might be a new twist. Right away I discovered it's sort of a rip-off of HP mixed with Chronicles of Narnia.     It's very fast-paced with little character development and it sort of tosses you right in the middle of everything which can be a little confusing. And if you know your mythology well (or took Latin, which I did!), the turn of events in the book is REALLY predictable.     It's interesting enough of a tale, I'd recommend it to vanquish boredom if nothing else, but if you're looking for something to dive into and fall in love with, this isn't the place!
1596680199|5.0|I saw this book in my PC beginner class, and once opened, I knew I HAD to have this.  It's clear, simple directions for MANY techniques are easy to follow and create what you envision THE FIRST TIME.  It has such a variety of techniques listed that it should be the basic curriculum for any beginner class.  I don't think that those experienced in the craft would be a thrilled as I was, but it has SO many faux techniques so detailed with excellent photos, I think anyone would find this valuable.  The creations are also excellent inspiration for variation and construction of jewelry.  Definate Keeper!
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Crayons stands out for three reasons. One is the effort Ms. Summer makes to put together a recording that fuses many types of styles and bring them to a popular audience.  The second reason this recording stands out,  is it actually works and the third is, it raises the stakes on her peers who have recently have been resorting to cover albums fit for the retirement homes of Florida. The last D.S. recording that managed to cover so many areas was Bad Girls which remains her masterpiece but Crayons definently comes close.  There are some downers on the recording but thats to be expected. The only real misstep with this release is the absence of \\"Its Only Love\\" on general american release(The person who is responsible for that should be fired)I just hope it was'nt Donna herself.  Circuit City is carrying the CD with that track.    On a final note, some of the reviews hav'nt been good.  We all know why.  One reason coud be how offensive it is that any african american woman attempt anything other than R and B and how dare anyone proclaim at 59 \\"Im A Fire\\" and sound so sexy proclaiming it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0823013626|5.0|I was totally new to clay working, heading for a class in the medium, when I purchased this book.  I was absolutely delighted, and was able to start my class with some background and understanding of working the materials.  I sit in awe of Ms. Kato's talent, and did find the techniques more difficult than they look.  This aside, it is an excellent accumulation of many of the techniques that makes polyclay such a joy to work with.  Ms. Kato does list several varieties of clay, inks, paints and other products, but I appreciate that she enumated which she found easier to work with, and why.  I did expect some bias towards Kato Polyclay, as she helped develop it, but have also found this an excellent product to work with and have not been disappointed with its performance.<br />The book is a MUST HAVE for the beginner reference library, and is also an inspiration with the images from Ms Kato and other artist's collections.  I'm pleased I purchased this book, and plan to keep it as a cornerstone for clay working.

0743455967|5.0|In April 2006 I attended a workshop, Creating for Creators, run by Robert Fritz (author of Your Life as Art, among other books). To those of us participants aspiring to be (better) writers, Robert recommended that we read Stephen King's On Writing. What a great recommendation!<br /><br />Stephen King is a class act - down to earth, likable, extremely funny, if On Writing is any measure - and someone to be trusted. King is both a regular guy, with whom you would enjoy having an informal conversation, as well as  - no one needs to hear this from me - one of the top novelists of our day.<br /><br />King demystifies the act and the art of writing fiction, and shares his perspectives on the mindset, discipline and hard work that it has taken him to create his novels over the past several decades. In earlier years he had to overcome tough financial circumstances, over-reliance on alcohol and other unsustainable substances, and his infamous near-fatal injuries sustained when hit by a van while out walking one day in 1999. King is truly an endearing person.<br /><br />The first part of the book is autobiographical, describing, among other things, the wild adventures of Stephen and his older brother David. Stephen's father left the home early on, leaving Stephen's strong-willed mother to raise the boys - a gritty life in rural Maine, with stints in Wisconsin and elsewhere. In summary, King worked very hard for each of his accomplishments; nobody handed him anything. The nail on his wall - later replaced with a larger spike - onto which he impaled his countless rejection letters from publishers, is testimony to King's tenacity.<br /><br />Here are some of King's thoughts:<br /><br />· The least of all [your concerns] should be polite society and what it expects. If you need to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered, anyway.<br /><br />· When the reader hears strong echoes of his or her own life and beliefs, he or she is apt to become more invested in the story.<br /><br />· People love to read about work.<br /><br />· There is a huge difference between story and plot (page 167)<br /><br />· The story (not the writer) is the boss.<br /><br />· Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's.<br /><br />· Let each of your characters speak freely; do not second guess the reaction of members of the \\"Legion of Decency\\"<br /><br />· The best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event<br /><br />King offers a somewhat contrarian view of the elements of a novel. In his approach there are three parts: narration, which moves the story from Point A to Point B; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader, and makes him or her a participant in the story; and dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech (page 159, paperback edition). King \\"distrust[s] plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless... and second, because I believe plotting, and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible... Plot is... the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.\\" )Having used a plot-driven approach with a novel I am writing, and not being pleased with the results, I buy into King's thoughts.)<br /><br />King prefers to start with a situation; the characters come next. He wants to put characters in some predicament, and then watch them try to work themselves free (page 161). King's job, as he sees it, is not to help the characters work themselves free but, rather, to \\"watch what happens and then write it down.\\" It's all about forming mental pictures and then documenting what you see, as truthfully and authentically as you can.<br /><br />King candidly describes the challenges of weaving in the back story that every novel has no choice but to possess... include too little, and the main story has insufficient foundation; include too much, and the main story is buried. King also addresses the heart-rending job (for writers, at least) of \\"killing your little darlings\\" - removing sometimes really good material from your novel, if it does not contribute to the story.<br /><br />The big bonus with this book that I never anticipated is that it is laugh-out-loud funny in all sorts of places. King's humour is enduring, clever, insightful, and not at anyone's expense.<br /><br />I have spent the last three years writing a 315-page novel. I am not happy with it, and prior to reading On Writing I was seriously contemplating abandoning my novel. I now plan to do to a major re-write, and this is due to my having read King's discussion of what he went through when writing The Stand; it reminds me so much of my situation with my novel. King has reassured me that the position I find myself in, or which I have created for myself, is not necessarily awful, unusual or irreconcilable. It may simply be a stop along the way toward creating a better novel. When I read about King's management of editing and drafts, it all looks so familiar, and I am grateful for indications from him that I may be on an OK track after all.<br /><br />Other related books I can recommend are On Writing Well - an informal guide to writing non-fiction, by William Zinsser, If You Want to Write - A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit, by Brenda Euland, On Becoming a Novelist, by John Gardner, Your Life as Art, by Robert Fritz, and The Elements of Style, by William Strunk and E.

B000ZN802W|5.0|This is one of the most haunting, mesmerizing, tragic, heartfelt, beautiful and inspiring films I've ever seen. And what is it that makes this film so extraordinary? It may not be the acting (though all is superb), or the scenery (wow!) - though those certainly add to its appeal. To me the whole film was like a philosophy lesson, with Emile Hirsch as Chris  McCandless acting out Socrates' dictum \\"know thyself\\" in a manner that most of us will only dream of doing.  McCandless knew what he was and where he wanted to go. He wanted no connection with the world of expectation, that world being held by those who had the money and all the things that money can buy. To him the new cars and the expensive condo and the corporate life were mere illusion - not parts of real life, but traps to be avoided at all costs.<br /><br />I think McCandless was right. How many people are stuck in prisons of their own making - in dead-end jobs that may pay the bills, but kill the spirit. How many purchases will we make, how many hours will we have to work to have those things which will give us only fleeting happiness? How many people are stuck in dead-end relationships - relationships on an express train to nowhere, where each person stays with the other because they can't stand being alone, or they can't make it on their own financially  (or for one of a hundred other reasons). People sit and wonder day after day why they're so unhappy. It's the rare person who finds the answer in time.<br /><br />We're all on a quest for freedom and love. McCandless took his own path into the wilds of his own heart and mind, and in his travels changed the hearts and minds of countless others. But what he did was specific to his needs, and we need not follow him exactly. The true tragedy of McCandless lay in his inability to find himself  in the people he met and befriended. In the end McCandless finds that freedom must be shared to be enjoyed. The unfortunate part was that he discovered this too late.<br /><br />The lesson's in the story, and our task is to tailor our own lives to fit. True freedom and love is always good. Find it together.'s in the story, and our task is to tailor our own lives to fit. True freedom and love is always good. Find it together.
1577314808|5.0|And it is now.  Many scholars and theologians have proposed that it was actually five to seven minutes ago, with some going so far as claiming it to have been last Tuesday.  Still others say that it will be in the next few minutes, with Dr. Chuck Woolery being the strongest voice in the \\"two and two\\" school.  But Eckhart deftly melds the seminal works of Van Hagar and Jesus Jones, into the definitive survey \\"Now That's What I Call Music\\" and produces an ironclad defense of immediacy. Do these alternate viewpoints still have a leg to stand on? Not now!
0679722610|4.0|RED HARVEST arose from a series of short stories Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) wrote between about 1923 and 1927 that featured \\"the Continental Op,\\" specifically an operative for the The Continental Detective Agency, San Francisco office.<br /><br />Hammett has to jump through a lot of narrative hoops to consolidate these short stories into the novels RED HARVEST and the slightly later THE DAIN CURSE, and the result is often excessively convoluted; readers often have to turn back several pages to figure out who has done what.  Even so, both novels continue to crackle today, and in creating them Hammett not only essentially created the American P.I. novel, he also developed a uniquely sparse, often brutal, yet often poetic style.  To say that both accomplishments have cast a long shadow indeed would be a profound literary understatement.<br /><br />RED HARVEST finds the nameless detective summoned by newspaper publisher Donald Willson to Personville, a mining town crammed to overflowing with corruption of every variety imaginable--and before the Op can meet with his client Willson is gunned down in highly suspicious circumstances on Hurricane Street, not far from the home of notorious good-time girl Dinah Brand.  It happens that Willson's father Elihu Willson, who founded the city, is now a captive to its corruption in more ways than one, and after the Op settles the question of who killed Douglas, the Op blackmails the old man into allowing him to clean up the town.<br /><br />The Op seldom plays by law-and-order rules, and his solution to the problem is both clever and direct: he creates a series of situations that sets the various crime bosses at odds.  Before you know they are gunning each other down in the streets, leaving both the Op and Dinah Brand to do some mighty frisky hopping in an effort to stay clear.  But can they, when there are so few easy ways out?<br /><br />A mixture of alcoholism and politics cut Hammett's career short; his short stories aside, he produced only five novels, and critics are quick to point out that THE MALTESE FALCON is his finest work.  I would agree with that, but while RED HARVEST may be less smoothly written, it has the unexpected energy of a great talent's first major work, and that more than makes up for the occasional rough edge in technique.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewercritics are quick to point out that THE MALTESE FALCON is his finest work.

014241039X|5.0|My kids absolutely wore out their paperback copy of The Twits, reading it so often that I ended up buying a hardcover to save money. I have read it three times myself, and ALWAYS laugh out loud while reading it. This is a short book, but typical of a Roald Dahl book, there is enough goofy humor here to gladden any heart. I always recommend this to people who have young children (particularly boys) with quirky senses of humor. A wonderful read-aloud book that is timeless.
B000R4SMD6|3.0|I first saw this movie on HBO, and while I was glad I didn't pay money in a theater to see it, I still don't think it's the biggest waste of movie time ever. (I'm still trying to get back the 90 minutes of my life I lost to \\"The Forgotten,\\" though I long since made Time-Warner refund me the $3.99 charge for its rental.) Initially I would have given Fracture 2 stars, but once I started thinking of Willie as a young Jack McCoy of Law and Order I decided it was really more of a 3, almost a 3.5 star movie.     This movie had nothing to do with Jack McCoy or Law and Order, I just felt like it should have.  Other reviewers said they would have been more accepting of this as a TV movie, and I came to agree. It would have been the perfect NBC Sunday night movie about how Jack McCoy of Law and Order came to be who he is.     It should have been a better movie; the writing, directing and acting could all have been better.  Hopkins is adept in his role as the intelligent and manipulative psychopath. Backhandedly overbearing, he subtly insults even while playing disarmingly naïve, dropping  hints to people that he is smarter than and a few steps ahead of them. Gosling is convincing as the cocky, overconfident young man. Typically he is not easily fooled and fairly unflappable, as certain of his success in the bedroom as the courtroom, but Gosling played his role with a bit too much of the \\"it's all good\\" attitude. He wasn't very convincing in scenes that were supposed to display urgency or intensity, not in the courtroom or out of it. There also wasn't much chemistry between him and Nikki, his new boss and romantic interest. That she was his new boss with whom he immediately gets involved with, and given that it was a job he got with an off hand legal stunt and still had to prove himself at should have made their affair feel more risqué, but didn't.  I generally couldn't feel the heat of his anger, frustration, or even lust. This could also have due to poor writing, directing, and maybe even casting. He did have one really good scene with one of the detectives, the one played by Cliff Curtis, where they were both frustrated with events and each other and played it well, so I couldn't be sure he couldn't deliver more emotional intensity if the movie had been better written and directed. Unfortunately the parts where tension and suspense were supposed to be building generally fell flat.     Now if it had been about Jack McCoy, Lobruto could have been Adam Schiff, making the scenes between them more emotionally charged, particularly the one where Willie says \\"that's what this is about, I'm not going to be you in 20 years\\" to Lobruto. Lobruto knows Willie better than Willie knows himself and seems to be able to mentor him in the same way Adam Schiff might have mentored a young Jack McCoy.  Fracture wasn't made for the Law and Order franchise, unfortunately.    As far as the DVD extras, there wasn't that much, but there are a lot of better movies with fewer DVD extras. Deleted scenes and alternate endings were included. They were interesting to see but better left out of the movie, in my opinion. There was no commentary track though and that seemed like sour grapes to me.     This is the story of a confident young lawyer that knows how to win and remain ethical, (even if he's riding the line ethically) but learns how to care. It's neither the best nor worst movie you'll ever see. I went ahead and got it from Amazon market place because I would have gotten it from the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, I just don't feel like waiting for it to get there.

B00005YU1O|3.0|It's annoying when a good idea goes essentially nowhere.  The premise is great, as a man struggles to reconcile the existential angst of human existence. He walks through a perpetual dream world, talking with several people, all of which give their own view on the nature of reality and our relation to it.  All to often I felt like I was in a freshman philosophy course in which the professor rambles on about a multitude of different topics, none of which are in enough depth to really get anything out of.   Just because someone talks about deep topics doesn't make the conversation deep.     After a very long middle section and several too many lectures, the movie actually gets somewhere as the protagonist starts to understand his dilemma and tried to wake up.  Unfortunately, while the ending does make everything come full circle, it is also glaringly obvious.    A good point is the animation, giving an interesting new surreal landscape with every scene.  At least that was well done, just would have been nice if it was more than a meandering sophomoric attempt at real understanding of some very complicated issues.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Look, abortion is nasty business. It should be legal, but rarely used. I guess that's the essence of \\"Choice.\\" I wish women too drunk or stupid to know when to say \\"no\\" would, but then we'd have a perfect world. (Naturally, they should never say no to me.) I liked Juno. All the characters are appealing and real enough. I particularly enjoyed Juno's dad and tough cookie-step-mom. I thought Jason Bateman hit the right notes as an immature rock and roll wanna be married to a serious yup woman, Jen Gardner. I'm glad he didn't put an aggressive move on Juno because this wouldn't be a feel good flick anymore.    The Dawson Creek, super smart teen characters with big vocabularies, well, I don't know. Sometimes Juno was way to smart to have been so stupid, so it works against the script. On the other hand, brilliant people do adolescent disasters too. My guess is: the film would have been fine if Juno and her girlfriend had average every day teen vocabs.

0307237702|4.0|This is definitely a different sort of book than I'm used to reading.  I bought this book last year, wanting to know about this man that seemingly came out of no where and snatched (in all likelihood) the Democratic nomination from a woman the country has been waiting 8 years to run.  I missed his 2004 speech, probably need to check youtube to see if there, but suddenly Barack was every where.  Delving into this book, I have to say I've come to really respect Obama intellect and there is certainly something to be said for charisma.  But are those two enough to lead us through the trouble times ahead?  Given our other choices, I'm certainly hoping that it better be.  If anyone is curious about this Presidential candidate, this is certainly a good starting point to get know his views and commitment to public service.  Definitely a good read.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I must say that I was surprised and not expecting this great album from Donna Summer. \\"Crayons\\" is not an attempt to recapture the sound and music she's perhaps best known as. This album is meant to stand against big artists of today and to capture the pop/hip-hop/r&b vibe that's popular today. Not only that but after being known as conquering disco, Donna Summer reaches ahead and goes for the club-crowd. Does it work? In all, yes. \\"Crayons\\" is fresh, exciting, has funny lyrics, introspective lyrics and outright unapologetic and fun.<br /><br />You'll like how upbeat the sound and tone of this album is. This is really a club record, testing out different styles (or perhaps crayons). The songs that work the best for me were the title track 'Crayons' that has a Caribbean/island sound and features Ziggy Marley. 'Stamp Your Feet' is a pop/inspirational song where Summers urges her audience to take a stand and to make their voices be heard. 'The Queen is Back' is by far the most fun, with Donna Summer obviously speaking of her return to the scene and not holding back on the 'diva' attitude we'd expect from her. The last track, 'Bring Down the Reign' features a choir of children and Donna Summer putting aside the club-vibe for something epic in sound and pulls off a quite moving song.<br /><br />What you may not like is the at times over-processed vocals that render her unrecognizable on some tracks.  This is the only area of the album that bothers me because so many artists, including Cher, Mariah and Madonna (mentioned in other reviews) have gone this same route as if it's the only way to compete with others in the business. It took away from some songs when I wished we'd hear more of her voice which we know is great and strong enough not to be picked apart by a computer.<br /><br />In all, a great effort from Donna Summer. I'm sure it'll be one of the albums that'll break out this year to everyone's surprise. Give it a listen, you will not regret it nor will you be wasting any money on purchasing it.hasing it.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|After a long drought of some 17 years, Summer is finally here. If you think I'm referring to the weather, you'd be half correct (what is Summer without Donna?), but I'm actually referring to the long awaited release of Donna Summer's first studio album in some 17 years.<br /><br />\\"Crayons\\" finds Ms Summer at the peak of her creative and vocal abilities, and much like her classic albums \\"Four seasons of love\\", \\"Once upon a time\\", \\"I remember yesterday\\", \\"Bad girls\\", or \\"I'm a rainbow\\" there is a unifying theme running through the album; celebrating human diversity through diverse sounds.<br /><br />Signed to Burgundy records, her label wanted her to do an album of standards like her contemporaries Rod Stewart, Diana Ross or Natalie Cole had. Summer however, had other ideas. She played them a song she'd penned, inspired she says by James Blunt's \\"You're beautiful\\", and the covers idea was never brought up again.<br /><br />What we get is a beautiful kaleidescope of colours expressed in sound, with all the songs co-penned by Summer. Opening is the anthemic \\"Stamp your feet\\", an inspirational get-back-up-in-the-game message  set to a dance/pop/hip hop sound. In a similar mould are the catchy but skeletal \\"Mr music\\" (with Timbaland-like synth strings and a reference to the ubiquitous iPod) and the tongue-in-cheek dig at her Queen of disco title \\"The queen is back\\" in which she name drops 2 of her big hits; \\"On the radio\\" and \\"Love to love you baby\\" (after a TV News segment-like intro). The last pair were co-written with Evan Bogart, son of her mentor at Casablanca records, the late Neil Bogart. Talk about coming full circle.<br /><br />Title track \\"Crayons\\" is an incredibly bouncy pop song with an island feel and additional vocals from Ziggy Marley who sounds so much like his father. I love the fun \\"Ay ay oh ohs\\".<br /><br />\\"Fame (the game)\\" is jaw-droppingly amazing, a dance/rock hybrid a la \\"Hot stuff\\" with a stomping beat which takes a look at the quest for, and pitfalls of fame with spoken verses (in an almost unrecognisable voice from Summer). This song sounds like it could have been lifted off \\"Bad girls\\" or \\"The wanderer\\".<br /><br />\\"Sand on my feet\\" is a tender acoustic ballad with Donna declaring undying love for her man and sounding very young. This song is a real grower, and reminds me a bit of \\"Big girls don't cry\\" by Fergie. Next is another awesome song, the salsa/jazz-tinged tinged \\"Drivin' down Brazil\\" (I love the ad libs, and the heavy bass line) inspired Summer says by a player type cool guy she spotted driving down a street called Brazil in Florida.<br /><br />\\"I'm a fire\\" is classic Summer, a latin-tinged dance song with a very European feel  and a retro-yet-contemporary sound. This has already topped the Billboard dance charts, and is sure to please those hungry for her disco days. The version on the album is slightly different from the single version; additional verses, and additional fleeting harmonies.<br /><br />Next comes a song bound to shock listeners. Is that really Summer singing? \\"Slide over backwards\\" finds Summer adopting the persona of a character called Hattie Mae Blanche DuBois (her photo appears in the CD too, of course it is Summer in silhouette), singing in a raspy drawl very much like Macy Gray, and singing to an upbeat harmonica/steel guitar laden honky tonk blues sound that would fit Tina Turner very nicely (think \\"Nutbush city limits\\"). It sounds strange at first, but grows more and more as you play it.<br /><br />\\"Science of love\\" is a bouncy and edgy rock number which is incredibly catchy, with lyrics about trying (and failing) to resist a lover. Summer, after all, was the first recipient of the best female rock Grammy award, a feat overlooked by most. This song is very radio friendly.<br /><br />Next is the album's masterpiece, the autobiographical ballad \\"Be myself again\\", the song she played for her record execs. It is a stark haunting piano ballad (with eerie synth flourishes during the bridge and chorus) and lyrics touching on the persona she had to display during her hey day, which was far removed from whom she really was. The opening poignant lines \\"Let me introduce myself/I'm a woman that you never see\\" reminds me of the beginning of the Rolling Stone's \\"Sympathy for the devil\\". Summer says she wanted her vocals to shine unencumbered by effects and beats, and thus came up with one of the most beautiful and powerful songs in her repertoire.<br /><br />Closing cut (on most versions of the CD) is the powerful Gospel tinged \\"Bring down the reign\\" which starts off with the rumble of gunfire before haunting Eastern violins (played by Miri Ben-Ari; she also makes a fleeting appearance on \\"Stamp your feet\\") African chants (backing vocals by The Agape Children's Choir, a group composed of South African AIDS orphans) and percussion sweep in, with Summer singing a prayer for Darfur. This song is incredibly moving, and reminds me a bit of Wyclef's \\"Million voices\\" from the \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" soundtrack. A stunning performance, and a prayer I hope is answered, not only in Darfur, but everywhere there is hate, intolerance and killing.<br /><br />As I stated, this is the closing cut on most versions of the CD, but some versions have a bonus cut, a track I feel is vital to your Summer collection. \\"It's only love\\" is a trancey dance song with surging, pulsing and throbbing synths, and Summer cooing in a voice last heard on songs like \\"Could it be magic\\" or \\"Now I need you\\". At a little over 7 minutes, it is a masterpiece, remniscent of her electronic classic \\"I feel love\\" and deserves to be massive. \\"Dancing dancing\\" she intones in a robotic trance as she takes us to a \\"land of a thousand dances\\". Awesome!! Buy, beg or steal a copy with this song!<br /><br />The album comes in a nice digipak with lovely photos of Summer. Her famous effusive \\"thank you\\" notes are back, and her daughters get a very touching tribute.<br /><br />There you have it. Her \\"Bad girls\\" album got 5 grammy nominations in the Rock, R&B, Disco and Pop categories, and \\"Crayons\\" has the potential to cut across genres come Grammy time. I know I'm a big Donna Summer fan so I'm probably biased (lol!), but this is definitely my favourite album released this year, and up there with the best of Summer's career, and one of her most heartfelt and personal artistic statements.display during her hey day, which was far removed from whom she really was.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I would have to say that p.s. I Love You was better then the Notebook. I Loved everything about this movie. It's Number 1 on my top favoite movies.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|I checked to see if this film which I rented from Netflix in HD DVD was available on Amazon in that format and it isn't.  Too bad because this film is one of Nick Cage's better efforts. Produced by him as well, Cage has a great role as an Russian-American who discovers the way to wealth is thru selling arms.  Of course he doesn't figure the enormous cost it will eventually lead him to but that's one of the intriguing outcomes of this absorbing film. The narrative is done in the style of Scorsese's \\"Goodfellows\\" and is effective plus the supporting cast (Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Bridget Monihan) is excellent.  Anyway the transfer I saw in HD is excellent and I figure the same goes for the Blu-ray version of this film.  Recommended for Cage enthusiasts!!
032147404X|5.0|I never expected this kind of books to be so enjoyable before reading Scott Kelby's work. It's no doubt the best guide for any DSLR amateur and fan, like me, for many years just shot around without any pro knowledge but only passion and love for life. Almost Every page provides me fresh realizations for phtography and I believe my experiences have improved a lot under Kelby's instructions. Many fascinating photos are presented inside which yield a most straightforward way for teaching.<br />Besides, I prefer the useful Tips always come at the bottom of a page. They are not only wisdom for shooting but also wisdom for life.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural follows the lives of two brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) & Dean Jensen Ackles) Winchester whose lives have been altered by the disappearance of their father in Season one. Together, the brothers unearth a world of the eerie, weird & just plain terrifying while they ultimately wage a 2-man war against evil.<br /><br />Continuing where season two left-off with Dean sacrificing his soul to the crossroads demon, to save Sam season 3 is explosive. Given only a year to live, Dean proves that he is anything but ready to face death. Facing a certain death within a year, Dean must ultimately come to terms with how he feels about death. Meanwhile Sam must adjust to the horrifying possibility of losing Dean-his older brother & sole father figure.<br />Although undeniably shorter (6-8 episodes) than previous seasons due to the writer's strike season 3 still fails to disappoint. Fans of previous seasons will love season 3 because of its continuing horrors & brotherly moments.  One of the things I most appreciate about season 3, is that viewers finally get to see what's beneath Dean's tough-guy facade. Meanwhile, new characters Ruby (Katie Cassidy) & Bela (Lauren Cohen) provide a new dimension of trouble for the boys.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|This is an incredible. I saw it as a kid and loved it. Many fans of the first movie compared this one to the first and had their perspective by the proverbial colored shades. See this one on its own and you'll love it. The real reason some fans don't like it is the creepy witchcraft theme. However, the lines, the acting, the great action scenes are all trademark Indy. If you don't get tripped up by the witchcraft theme (you know pulling live hearts from chests -while the victim is still alive!), then git this one will ya already?!
B00151G08Y|5.0|OK, so yea, it isn't  exactly like their older material, but this cd takes all the bad from the old cd and keeps all the great beats and creativity of Pendulum! It's SOOO GOOD! I can listen to this cd all the way through and not have to change the song. It's not as intense as before in the orignal drum and bass style, but it's really out there space-y, and has a ton of great vocals and background noises. And the songs are all interesting and diverse, i felt like their old cds had a lot of hits and a lot of misses, and this cd is all great. SERIOUSLY, some reviewers are just not used to the bands changes, but all bands change and adapt, and Pendulum is steering drum and bass in a new and amazing direction. REALLLY good, especially propane nightmares, granite, the other side, well, basically all of them. check it out!
B0013J30XG|4.0|I knew coming into the theater, I was in store for a more futuristic, special effects laden series of car races given today's relentless let's see how we can go over the top competition among special effects laden movies.  I got what I expected and I agree that at times I felt a headache coming on just trying to figure out what was going on in the races with frenetic, chaotic camera action and endless explosions and spinning, flipping, jumping, looping, and crashing constantly going on.  However, the surprise, atleast for me anyway, was the story.  I respect Susan Sarandon as an Oscar winning actress and wondered why she would take on this role, aside from the money.  I can see why.    Other reviewers have complained of too much dialogue, but to me, behind the action, that's the HEART of the story. It's about family loyalty.  John Goodman and Susan Sarandon play their parts well and believeable as car racing parents and Christina Ricci as Trixie as well as the humorous well matched child and chimp combo made me remember the characters from the series and I admired the constant bonding throughout the movie.  Matthew Fox also for me made this movie great as being the tormented but determined lost brother Racer X.  It's a movie about good vs. evil and good coming out the winner.    Several times throughout the movie, I was like C'MON!!!  The racing was too much, I am looking forward to watching the animated series again with its simpler, understandable racing action.  Luckily, there is one racing sequence, a cross country rally during the course of the movie which was a bit easier to follow.    I guess perhaps I went into this movie without a lot of expectations and was taken by some different elements than what many other viewers caught.  To each his own opinion, I respect that, but I liked this movie not for the blazing, over the top, slam bang crash special effects, but what I feel the directors made beyond the racing.     It's all about family and I got the message.  Sincerely,  William
1563890119|4.0|I have to admit that I wasn't as blown away by this as I'd hoped to be, given how many people had recc'd this series to me. The going was a little muddled and slow at first, but definitely picked up steam as the story progressed. I guess even masters like Gaiman have to find their feet sometimes! Anyway, I'm glad I persevered, and the set up certainly left me curious enough to pick up the next volume, so I guess it did its job.    I am glad to hear that random 'guest stars' from other comics series aren't going to play much of a role in Sandman in the future, because I thought that was a bit of a weak link in this volume.

So many styles, so many ranges.  Only Donna Summer can do that!!!!<br /><br />I liked it so much, I had to buy more for family and friends!<br /><br />Thanks to all who worked on this project.

B0016B6ZKG|1.0|\\"Crayons\\" - a non-classy name for a fuddled come-back attempt.    I am a big Donna Summer fan but was deeply disappointed with the new CD.  She attempts too many diverse styles and in the process sabotages any semblance of cohesion.  Hearing Ms. Summer wail the blues, complete with harmonica and lyrics regaling the listener of \\"Hattie Mae\\", I cringe, hoping that this is a bad dream.  Madonna, Kylie, Cher and many gifted others have shown that despite their age, they can produce quality pop for the new millennium - perhaps Ms. Summer should take a cue from them.
B0013FSXT6|4.0|Initially I sat down to watch this as a labor of love for Kubrick. I was told by many credible opinions that it was anywhere from \\"okay\\" to \\"awful\\", with the occasional \\"not bad\\" thrown in. But when I sat down and watched it myself, I realized all over again that there is a reason so many people followed Kubrick through the years: he is a master of mood.  And that is one thing I got from the movie. The other thing I enjoyed was the interplay between Kidman and Cruise, with their awkward marital problem, and Cruise trying to cope with it. It's a film that seems to question the nature of man and his emotions/desires. A rewarding watch.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This was absolutely dreadful. It was totally unrealistic and stupid. I had no idea as to what was going on, first it was this weird party for the entire first quarter of the movie where people where gossiping about the person the party was for. Then an oil tanker explodes and everyone's screaming. Then out of no where this giant bug thing appears (it's really weird) and starts killing people. Then one of the characters wants to go after his friend where the bug is. So they all go after it. Then some mini versions of the bug (WTF? Where did these come from) attack them and injures some bitchy person that the person in charge of the camera is hitting on. Later she has to be killed because she was bitten and there's no explanation. So they come to this destroyed building and someone says that the friend is on the 39th floor. So they then go up to the 57th floor of another building and have to walk across some poles to another part of the building. They then find the person who may or may no be injured. First she was dead, then she was hurt, then they got something out of her, then she couldn't walk, and then she could run all of a sudden. What the hell? So then they get out of the building and find the helicopter before the town gets blown up (Yes, they were going to blow up Manhattan). They find the helicopter (Which just happens to be a block away) and get in. Then they see the bug thing die and then all of a sudden it's alive again. Then they crash for no apparent reason. They all survive the several hundred foot drop without the gas tank exploding, or hitting a building, or any of the many deadly things that would have happened. They just happen to land in central park. Then the bug thing picks up the guy with the camera, kills him, and puts him down (The camera survives again). Then the remaining two people go under a bridge and sum up the story by saying \\"I love you\\" to each other as the bridge collapses on them. The camera survives several tons of rock and is later found by people. (Wait, didn't they blow Manhattan up? Oops, I guess not.)<br />Other bad things: It went from the middle of the night to morning in one hour. It was REALLY short, barely over an hour. It made no sense. You couldn't see anything with the camera and by the end of the movie I was about to throw up from the motion.<br />ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL! DO NOT WATCH THIS!ter found by people.

0800141806|3.0|`Philadelphia' tells the heroic tale of Andrew Beckett, a one time hot young lawyer who was unjustly fired from his job when his superiors discovered he was suffering from the AIDS virus.  At times this film is extremely touching and ultimately it is inspiring, but it suffers from clich&eacute;s and an air of simplicity that robs it of any real emotional impact.  I won't say that this is a bad film; it is just not a great one.<br /><br />Andrew Beckett is young and smart and steadily climbing the corporate ladder in his law firm.  He has a caring young boyfriend and very caring and understanding parents; yet something is terribly wrong.  Andrew has contracted the deadly virus known as AIDS and as time progresses this virus begins to ware away at his health.  He conceals this disease from his workmates, but when his illness becomes visible he is unable to hide it any longer and he finds himself being fired.  Of course the law firm will not admit their reasons are based on his physical condition, but the reason given is so shaky that it leads Beckett to conclude the obvious.  This is when Beckett approaches lawyer Joe Miller to represent him on trial.  Joe turns down the case claiming that he doesn't think Beckett's lawsuit would hold up in court but it is more than obvious that Beckett's condition as well as his `alternative' lifestyle sit crossly with Miller and are the real reasons for his refusal to help.  Joe does have a change of heart though and takes on Beckett as a client.<br /><br />The initial concept for the film (loosely based on a true account) is intriguing and stock full of potential, but I feel as though it missed the boat somewhere.  Many parts of the film seem clich&eacute;d to me, as if they were just presenting us with what we think we are supposed to see.  I can't help but feel too that the film was a tad too simple, one-dimensional even.  There really seemed to be no true character development (aside from Miller) and this just didn't sit right with me.<br /><br />This leads me to Hanks.<br /><br />I have a feeling I am in the minority here but I just didn't appreciate Tom Hanks' performance.  I felt that it was clich&eacute;d and gimmicky and in the end it never really felt `real'.  I never felt like I really knew `who' Andrew Beckett was.  I knew his circumstance and I knew his plight, but I didn't know him.  Hanks tries to explain Beckett to us during an excruciating opera scene where Hanks reaches levels of ridiculousness I just couldn't believe would be omitted in this film.  The scene itself should have been stirring and emotionally reaching but Hanks just didn't get it and it comes off mediocre at best.  As a whole I felt that his performance was weak when compared to his co-stars, especially Denzel, who completely owed his performance.<br /><br />Denzel Washington really surprised me here.  His performance is by far the best in the film, for he actually tells the audience a story.  We know where this man came from, why he feels the way he does; we know what upsets him and what makes him uncomfortable and ultimately we see a progression of character, real growth that delivers to us the man he is when the credits begin to role.  This is much more than can be said for Hanks' portrayal of Andrew Beckett.  In my humble opinion Oscar got this all wrong, awarding Hanks for a playing a gimmick yet snubbing Washington for creating an honest character.<br /><br />The supporting players are decent here, some better than others.  Antonio Banderas has a tendency to over-act, sometimes it works (his Zorro is flawless) and other times it is too much, which is the case here.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Demme had a lot to live up to with all the attention and praise he garnered for `The Silence of the Lambs', but he just couldn't really pull this one together.  The film plays out well, it looks good, and there are moments that touch the audience, but there is not the intended impact; at least not for me.  I know that a lot of people really enjoy this film, laud it even and I know that the critics sang its praises (or at least Hanks' praises) but I can't do either.  The film is important in that it takes its serious subject very seriously and it proved to open the eyes of many to a growing problem, but in the end I'm just not `that' impressed.  Washington is award worthy, that is for sure, but the film as a whole is lacking.hat the critics sang its praises (or at least Hanks' praises) but I can't do either.

B00004Z400|5.0|Adrenaline and Around The Fur may have been good albums, but White Pony is where the Deftones really crawl deeper into their sound, and digging up New Wave musical influences like The Smiths and The Cure.  All the while, they manage to stay very heavy, as singer Chino Moreno channels his inner Morrissey and croons heartfully in between his guttural screams.    While songs like \\"Elite\\" and \\"Korea\\" tread over familiar moshing territory, the band really shines when they go beyond the familiar Nu-Metal sound.  \\"Feiticeira,\\" with its infectious snare work and walls of distortion, is kept melodic by the vocals.  Slower, more progressive tracks like \\"Change,\\" \\"Rx Queen,\\" and \\"Digital Bath\\" are hypnotic, and you can't help but just float with the music.    Unfortunately, Deftones have never been able to top this album since its release, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this once Nu-Metal band was able to break free from that stale musical mold, and forge their own way into infamy.
B0013FXWVU|3.0|*Horton Hears a Who* pretty much follows the book by Dr. Seuss.  However, because of its \\"strict\\" adaptation of the book, the movie is best for kids.<br /><br />Horton is dilly-dallying around when he suddenly hears a voice coming from a speck of dust drifting in the air.  He soon discovers that there is a village of Whos in the unrooted speck.<br /><br />He shares his findings with his friends in the jungle of Nool.  His friends are hesitant to believe him since it's impossible to have inhabitants living in a dust speck.<br /><br />Despite their disbelief, Horton continues to guard the speck and searches for a haven for the people of Whoville.  Kangaroo, bitter and adamant, seeks help from a vulture to destroy the speck since Horton must be losing his mind!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mayor Ned McDodd, of Whoville, must convince his people that their city is somewhat in danger.  No one believes him, not even his son and 96 daughters.<br /><br />Horton and the mayor must find a way to send the message to their friends as well as finding a solution.<br /><br />Again, cute movie that's just perfect for kids.  Adults just might tire of this film after 30 minutes or so since it is not like other animated films, such as *Cars*, *Shrek* and the like.

0679805273|5.0|Oh, the Places You'll Go! is an uplifting and encouraging book describing a major life lesson that is applicable to children and adults alike. The book is a promoter of focusing on the positive and moving quickly past the negative. The narrator addresses the reader through the small boy that appears in almost every illustration. Your life is seen and addressed through the eyes of this small boy. The book describes many situations that one may encounter in life, such as facing an unfamiliar place or situation, Seuss questions whether the reader will stop, or will they go on. He comments that life may be confusing, but waiting for others to control your life will not allow you to achieve the \\"places that you'll go\\". He encourages his reader to be ready for anything, and to not be afraid to be out there alone. Continuing on will allow you to succeed, even through the most difficult dilemmas you may face.<br />Teachers could use the text as an example of well-crafted poetry, an example of how to incorporate many different text qualities into poetry. This book would be best to use when introducing poetry, to discuss how that even though it is a poem, with poetic qualities - poems still contain the conventions and styles that traditional stories and writings contain. This book also has varying examples of metaphors and similes, they are simple, so it is easy for the early elementary student to grasp.  Oh the Places You'll Go is a great example of traditional poetry, which can be used in many ways to introduce poetry and rhyme scheme in the classroom.

B00127RAJY|5.0|At age 28, my adult metabolism started to catch up with me, and I went from a size 6/8 to a 10/12 in about a year and a half. After trying every diet in the book, I finally realized that it was time to bite the bullet and begin working out regularly. Before I go much further, it is important that you understand - I HATE working out. I have no attention span, I work about 12 hour a day, and would pretty much rather do anything other than exercise.     But, I hated the extra 20 pounds even more. Also, as my husband and I are starting to make plans for kids and such, it became more about being healthy, as well. (I won't lie - the vanity was definitely a bigger motivator!) I started doing some 20 minute workouts in the morning - tai bo, pilates, Carmen Electra's strip tease, etc. I enjoyed them and they were definitely challenging. After a few weeks, I began to see changes in my body, and I wanted to go further.    So, I tried this one. And, the first day - it kicked my a**. I felt it all day, but I also felt stronger, better, and had more energy all day, as well. This one is now my favorite, and has had a huge impact on my body after just a few weeks.     Other reviewers mentioned that there was nothing new - kind of the same old moves from PE. That's what I like about it, though. They are moves that I already know how to do, so I don't spend the entire workout \\"learning\\" the routine. I tend to struggle with a lot of dance and aerobics workouts, because I find remembering the order of the moves to be challenging.     Yes, this one was challenging, and Jillian acknowledges that. I find that refreshing - she's not all smiles and \\"just one more, you look beautiful.\\" She knows it's tough, but she also knows that it works - and it does.

B0014Z4ON4|2.0|I did want to see the whole series for continuity, but in a lot of ways, \\"Temple of Doom\\" blows continuity right out of the water.  If you really want to watch the films in chronological order, you need to start with \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" (occurs in 1935) then watch \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" (occurs in 1936).     When \\"Temple\\" opens, Indy's (Ford) trying to get an idol from Chinese gangsters. He manages to escape them--but unwittingly ends up on one of their planes with nightclub singer Willy (Capshaw) and 12-year-old Chinese orphan boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan).     Indy wakens to discover their pilot has bailed out and left them without parachutes.  They crashland and end up in India.  A beleaguered village elder seeks Indy's help to recover their sacred stones and the kidnapped village children.  What they discover is a Thugge cult.     This is probably the roughest of the Jones flicks so far and IMHO, stretches the PG-13 rating to the breaking point with violence, harm to children. Capshaw is supposed to be a comedic foil, but she just comes off useless. Short Round is cute, but he's not Sallah and Spielberg must have realized that, because he doesn't appear in later films. Harrison Ford is good--he just can't quite carry the whole film on his rugged shoulders.     Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B0000028VT|4.0|Already an established pop phenomenon by 1993, no one thought Mariah Carey could top the success she had.  But she proved naysayers wrong by releasing this album, which remains the most successful album of her career.    While nowadays her lyrics are more expressive of her feelings, at this time she used her vocals to show where her mindset was. Here she doesn't seem to use either, and for the only time thus far, Mariah Carey released material that sounds a lot like going through the motions.  To date, this is probably her most impersonal album.    That being said, the material on here is top notch.  Her two big hits (which still remain two of the biggest hits of her career), \\"Dreamlover\\" and \\"Hero,\\" represent her seemingly effortless ability to appeal to both younger and older audiences.  The former is a light, feel good song that just gives you a happy feeling, and the latter is an inspiring slow ballad that is perfect for adult contemporary stations.  The rest of the album is set up like that, with songs like \\"Dreamlover\\" (\\"Now That I Know,\\" \\"I've Been Thinking About You) and \\"Hero\\" (\\"Anytime You Need a Friend,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Never Forget You\\") all mixed together.    The songs are fantastic, as is Mariah's vocals, but this album is more representative of her commercial savvy than her artistic.  It's not her very best album, but it is a lot better than some.
B000002UAR|5.0|With \\"Rubber Soul\\", the Beatles started maturing as artists and moving away from \\"mere\\" teen pop, but it was with \\"Revolver\\" that they hit their peak. Certainly the albums that came later were perhaps even more ambitious and got more press and, yes, hype. Nevertheless if I have to choose a favorite Beatles album, it would be \\"Revolver\\". I've had this album for a long time (in LP format), and it's been one of my favorites. Almost by coincidence I was recently exposed to this album again after many years. I'm happy to say that this one absolutely stands the test of time. It's now on heavy rotation in my stereo.<br /><br />Originally on LP the US and UK releases of the Beatles allbums up to and including this one were different. I the case of \\"Revolver\\" the difference was that the U.S. version was missing 3 songs. The CD release is the UK version, so it includes all 14 tracks. There really isn't a weak track on the album, although perhaps the least \\"essential\\" track is \\"Dr. Robert\\". It's certainly a decent enough song, but it's not fantastic and doesn't really add anything crucial to the song mix. One reviewer suggested that \\"Paperback Writer\\", which has a similar style, would have been a better inclusion, and I would agree. Actually when I listen to the album, I typically skip two songs, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Love You To\\". Both are certainly very creative groundbreaking songs that add to the variety of the mix, but frankly I don't need to hear them too often (all 3 of George's \\"raga rock\\" tunes have not dated well, IMHO). Everything else on the album is absolutely great.<br /><br />George Harrison's other two songs, the opener \\"Taxman\\" and \\"I Want To Tell You\\" are among his best, and really show him hitting his peak as a songwriter. Eleanor Rigby's lyrics and music (including brilliant orchestration) are case study in isolation and despair. \\"For No One\\" is also rather sad, but brilliantly crafted ballad by McCartney. \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" is more optimistic and has to be considered one of Mcartney's best songs ever. \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" are wonderful too, both bursting with a positive vibe.<br /><br />John Lennon's other 3 compositions are all experimental in nature. \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" `s most distinct feature is a very unusual guitar riff. The sound of the guitar can be described as a sunnier version of the one on \\"Rain\\" (The single \\"Paperback Writer\\" / \\"Rain\\" is stylistically consistent with this album). This is contrasted with a refrain that sounds almost retro. The part when he sings \\"I'll be `round\\" could almost be from an early Beatles song. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"She Said, She Said\\" Have a druggy, lazy feel to them, with the latter having more overt psychedelic references. Of course the song that takes the experimentation to the furthest degree at that point in time is the closing song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". This one must have truly been a mindblower in 1966! It incorporates all sorts of avant-guarde experimentation techniques - drones, tape effects, distortion, and a really strange song structure that basically has no chord changes to it. Not to mention the creepy \\"seagull\\" noises! The result is absolutely hypnotic and spooky. I really sounds like it's coming from another dimmension. Although this is definitely John's creation, evidently it was Paul that introduced the band to the tape manipulation techniques that were being used by such avant-guarde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen. This contradicts the conventional wisdom that John was the experimenter and Paul was the conventional pop guy. They all seemed to have a real talent for absorbing ideas and influences, which they then seamlessly vowe into their onw style.<br /><br />In addition to strengths of the individual tracks, what makes this a fantastic album is how cohesive it is. There is incredible diversity, but it all fits together wonderfully.

B00005JLEU|4.0|My eleven year old daughter loves this video, but she was really upset that it took so long to get here--I can't believe you guys can't do better than eight days from Springfield, Mass. to Jaffrey, NH.  I can drive it in about two hours.  As a matter of fact, after a week, I mentioned that to my daugher, and she asked if we could \\"please drive down and pick it up\\" ourselves.<br /><br />My previous experience with Amazon has always been extremely positive.  Too bad this one kinda sticks out.
B00004VVN9|3.0|BRAINSTORM was a good sci-fi film that I saw in the early 80's. Unfortunately, I never saw this movie on a full size theater screen. Overall, I score it at three stars. In my opinion the premise of the movie deserves four stars for originality and the major portion of the film three for competent execution. The conclusion only merits about two stars for not living up to the great premise.<br /><br />I first saw BRAINSTORM on an old VHS tape on a large screen projection TV and really missed seeing it in the theater. The idea that all perceptions (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, reactions and reflexes of the body and emotions of the mind) can be recorded and experienced on multi-track tape is perhaps a bit too ambitious for us to totally suspend our disbelief, but sums up the very original premise of the film. This had me enthralled in the early 80's when I first saw the movie.<br /><br />Some of the wonderful applications tangentially hinted at by BRAINSTORM for this sci-fi technology included: virtual reality, simulation, accelerated learning, verbal and non-verbal communications of feelings and emotions (i.e., seeing through another individuals senses as filtered through their personal feelings), psychological applications, marriage counseling, recording near death and death experiences, and some not so wonderful military applications including intelligence and information gathering, mind control, trauma and torture). The film managed to hint at these many applications by brief visual example while telling its story.<br /><br />When I recently watched BRAINSTORM on a decent quality DVD my overall film experience was not that much better than provided by the original VHS tape. As some fans of the film have already commented, this DVD transfer was not too good and we can only hope that a future release of a better DVD transfer will be available. This DVD did not hold up on a LCD 52\\" large screen TV. The overall experience was better on a 23\\" to 36\\" screen.<br /><br />In my opinion, the most original thoughts of the writer exhibited by visual example included: improving marital relations by conveying how the prior behavior of both individuals was perceived through the eyes and mind of their spouse and how the death experience of an individual (having a fatal heart attack) could be recorded for later playback and study.<br /><br />The first wonderful application was illustrated by Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken who decided to cancel their impending divorce and reunite after experiencing less than five minutes of each others thoughts colored by their emotions and seeing how their own previous behavior appeared through their spouse's eyes. No lengthy marriage counseling, just experiencing a few critical minutes of each others perceptions and thoughts as viewed through their spouse's eyes. A wonderful sci-fi concept and to my knowledge the first time this has ever been suggested in film.<br /><br />The second interesting and curious application explored the mystery of death and was a great sci-fi concept and appears a credible one as long as there is electrical activity within the brain. Complete death means brain death and electrical flat line, at which point there is nothing to record, let alone perceive during playback. Within the film story the unexpected death experience of a brilliant and dedicated lead scientist was recorded for her assistant to receive as her last selfless \\"gift\\" to science. In order to extend this thought the writer employed the overused story line of the project being taken over by an evil military project after the death of the scientist that prevents the original assistant from playing back the recording left for him.<br /><br />The motives for the government project to deprive him of this experience are never explained. The military just plays the part of the heavy to allow the hero to work hard at eventually beating the system which allows the assistant to experience the recording with little more than the help of his wife and friends. I guess the ending was doomed to failure for being too ambitious, but I couldn't help but hope that I was in for a great film experience. Considering the originality of the premise, who knew the ending would be so weak?<br /><br />The special effects by Douglas Trumbull were good enough for their time, but ultimately disappointing. The performances of Chris Walken, Natalie Wood and Louise Fletcher were also very good. The ending of the movie was a major disappointment, and the story became very silly when depicting the details of how the assistant thwarted the flimsy controls of the government authorities.<br /><br />This film could have been a great movie if directed and thought out by the likes of a Stanley Kubric or Steven Spielberg. In fact, this film might be a good candidate for remake using an infusion of some great thought and state of the art special effects. The limited success of this movie is a consequence of going to press before the creative process of writing a good script was complete. I believe that Hollywood should turn this story over to a talented young writing team and allow them the time needed to dream up a more satisfying ending. The acting talent and technical tools in place for a well funded studio will result in a magnificent work of science fiction cinema and a great sci-fi film experience for future movie fans.s the ending was doomed to failure for being too ambitious, but I couldn't help but hope that I was in for a great film experience.

B00005JPS7|4.0|I am not a fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is a great actor in this role.<br />Tony Stark (Iron man), a scientist specialized in weapon development, is kidnapped by terrorists, and during his hostage, he creates an Iron man to his escape and soon the Iron man becomes his new identity.  Upon his return, he decides to lead himself to a new direction but a weapon developer. His decision accidentally moves him closer to unveil a nasty truth and also exposes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Paltrow) in danger.<br /><br />The character of Iron man fits Robert Downey Jr. who is not afraid of authority, witty, brilliant, and ultimately makes this flick a gem.<br /><br />Iron man definitely brings a different atmosphere amongst the superheros who are usually low-profile and secretive such as superman, batman, and spiderman.<br />Additionally, Iron man shows himself in box office just in a right time since we are a tad fed up with the aforementioned superhero sequels.<br />(at least I am ...)
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is my favorite show out of all the shows I have ever seen. From the amazing storyline, to the importance of family, to the scariness and creepiness of a hunter's life, this show is just pure amazing. I own both Season 1 and 2, and the DVD set is really great. It contains all of the episodes, in better quality than on TV, and it also has the commercials cut-out, and this makes for an easier watch. The DVDs also have a extras and bonus features offered, and that it is neat to see the behind-the-scenes action and, the best feature on this DVD set is definitly the bloopers. They are hysterical! I have been through two other summers without new episodes, and have learned very well how important these DVD sets are. You just watch a few episodes whenever you miss seeing Sam and Dean. This summer is going to be torture! I can't wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD, and I can't wait for Season 4 to start. Kripke you are a genius!
1416550518|5.0|It's hard to believe this magnificent novel is a first effort by Kate Morton.  I will certainly be looking forward to her future work, as this is a well-crafted narrative that exposes a story from the past through the remembrances of ninety-eight-year-old Grace Bradley.<br /><br />A scandalous tragedy at a lavish English party in 1924 is about to be made into a movie and, as the last surviving person from the event, Grace is interviewed by a dedicated young filmmaker.  The filmmaker wants to be clear on all details of a young poet's suicide and present an accurate portrayal.  Only Grace knows that history in not correct and what everyone thinks happened did not happen at all.  She has kept the secret for over 70 years and it has haunted her memory.<br /><br />Morton does a masterful job of taking the reader into the lives of the idle rich, the servants who are devoted to them, and the secret liaisons that connect the two classes in forbidden ways.  The conflict between desire and possibility is played out generation after generation.<br /><br />The unreliability of accepted facts, the haunting of the present by the past, and the inescapability of inherited social standing determining one's fate all combine for a searing story I could not put down.<br /><br />The characters are wonderfully three-dimensional, the plot well-paced and highly believable, the explosive conclusion well worth the time invested.  I cannot recommend this one highly enough and can only hope Kate Morton continues to gift us with her talent for storytelling.
B001675YQ6|1.0|This movie does not contain the degree of wit and irony to pull off the whole \\"we're talking about a movie within a movie\\" concept.  The American/British accent Murphy displays is covered up by the excuse \\"she grew up in America,\\" how opaque.    Don't even bother.
B000002JPA|5.0|D.T.'s debut disc was initially tagged as post hair metal. Since Pull Me Under got some pretty heavy tv and radio play. Like many, I ran out to buy it and soon realized,DT were anything but hair metal. Way too much talent. More in the vein of a super gifted Queenscryche. Song by song, excellent. A masterpiece and a great start to a band that has given us so much. A must have for music fans period.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Crayons is an awesome album.Donna Summer has went above and beyond this time around. Crayons will be a landmark album for Donna. Every track is outstanding. The music contains elements of rock, dance, funk, hip hop and pop all covered with Donna Summer's hot and ever bold vocal power. Donna Summer is still in top vocal form even at the young age of 59.    My favorite tracks on the album at this point are:    \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is absolutely mind-blowing and is an excellent way to open the album.     \\"Mr. Music\\" is my favorite on the album. I love the strong dance rhythm and catchy lyric.    \\"Crayons\\" (featuring Ziggy Marley... this song totally rocks with a hint of a reggaeton sound to it.     \\"Fame (The Game)\\" is a great jamming song with an important message.     Every song on the album is Fot Stuff and is well worth purchasing!

B0010YSD7M|3.0|Let's face the facts. Stargate SG-1 ran out of gas around Season 6 or 7. The last three years of the series, the program was sucking on fumes. I hate to say that, because I loved watching the program when Richard Dean Anderson was starring. I have to say I only bought the 'Ark of Truth' because they left the Ori plot line dangling when the final season ended. To be honest, I felt cheated out of my money for this DVD. Granted, the producers had more money for creating a longer, more special effects laden product. Unfortunately they forgot the plot. I always had the impression that the Ori, this supposedly invincible foe, was going to end with a whimper. That is how it felt to me. Did we really need a plot line that had the Replicators involved one more time? How many times do you need to defeat them before they go away, permanently? I will have to think long and hard about shelling out for the second installment, Continuum. Three stars for what the series originally offered the fans.
0618918248|5.0|Let me start off by warding off those closed minded Fundamentalist thinkers, you can't change your mind nor can you fully comprehend what you are reading. These people believe in: Vampires, Werewolves, burning Witches, Ghouls, Ghosts, Incubus, Succubus, Demons, Angels&Devils, Beelzebub, human sacrifice(Old Testament), offering their daughters up for gang rape(Sodom Old Testament), rivers turning to blood, raining frogs, boils, wholesale murder(death of the first born), Jonah(a man living in a whale), sun rotating around the earth, The Great Flood, The Ark, a Virgin Birth, Lazurus raising from the dead(I wonder whatever happened to him anyway), Resurrection of Jesus(bodysnatchers probably), Praying to non existant Entities(schizophrenia, or talking to yourself), The Whore of Babylon(great title), Lilith(Adams evil ex-wife), Garden of Eden, A Talking Snake(O Brother!), Rampant Inscest(Old Testament, where else do you think all the people came from after Adam and Eve were thrown out of Eden), Women the reason for all Evil in the world(The Bible), The Apple(any scientist will tell you that apple trees don't exist in that part of the world)ect. ect. ect. The list could be endless. I want to say that this book 'The God Delusion' had a profound effect on the way I will tolerate people who choose self imposed ignorance and fear of the unknown(called Faith)over scientific fact. These childish people should be shunned as potentially dangerous(as history has shown so)to intelligent free thinking individuals. Atheist's try to work, learn, live and love in a dangerous world, but unfortunately were surrounded by superstitious, zealous, hate mongering yokels who would do anything...even kill(bombing abortion clinics, shooting Doctors) or impose anything, politics...(teaching creationism, prayer in schools, we walked with dinosaurs, hate gay people ect.) to make you or your children fit into their Idea club.  Religion is a choice, though not a smart one. Richard Dawkins you are a brilliant, articulate, literate man and I will read anything and everything you've ever written.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I was a little afraid when I purchased this CD and with good reason; there are a couple of things I really dislike. But the things I do like are many, many more. This is our real and true Madonna, the one we grew up with, the one after whom we wore tight white lacy corsets only to be yelled at by our parents. Yes, she's here in every track. It's refreshing and I know that sounds weird because how can it be refreshing if it's retro? Fine, so it is retro, but it's so fresh! It's the music we all danced to back in the day. Madonna has NEVER disappointed, every single album has been a reinvention and this one is not the exception. It's light, poppy, sticky and sweet! The thing I disliked? I could have done without ANY of the hip hop or rap or whatever it's called these days. But other than that this album is a winner.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this album and finally came out. Even when I expected more disco songs I LOVE this album... Great voice and great orquestrations... In a world where  poor voices with great promotions reign the market Ms. Donna Summer return (comeback ;-) is greatly praised.Hope all her fans buy the album because we must stand by the real artists and the genuine voices. These CRAYONS will put some spectacular colors on your emotions... Cheers...!
B0000025KI|4.0|I stood in line at midnight to buy this record in 1980.  As time went on, I played it less and less often.  After seeing the band's Indianapolis show in March, I decided to buy the CD version.  Definitely a trip down memory lane.  It's a great album, but not necessarily Bruce or the E Street Band's best.  It's a somewhat disappointing follow-up to Darkness on the Edge of Town and a hint of Born in the USA-type things to come. It also shows you how that other Jersey band (Bon Jovi) developed their sound.  I'm not saying they copped it from Bruce and the band.  I think it was the sound that was floating around the Atlantic coast at the time and The River wraps that sound up very nicely in two albums. The River is a fun rock-n-roll archeological dig.

Best part is I trust this will work for me WHILE the kids burn off steam as well!!!!  Bonus!! :)  You won't regret this purchase!  Thank you Jillian, you truly are an inspiration.
B000VR824S|3.0|Having been at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Fest, I was greatly disappointed in this DVD.  While some fantastic performances were captured, the DVD has some serious technical flaws which seem to result in missing footage.  Great concert, mediocre concert DVD.

B0013BNY2Q|2.0|Accelerate is being hyped as a return to form for REM, but it's really just a return to the familiar. The band's last three or four albums may have been saddled with some undeniable excesses and missteps, but all of them managed moments of real beauty or, at the least, interesting strangeness. Accelerate strips away all those excesses to reveal something that, for all its noisiness, is shockingly dull.     The album brings back everything you thought had been lacking from the band's last few albums, only to prove that what's really been missing is simply inspiration. Peter Buck finally abandons the disinterested strumming that's characterized too much of his guitar playing since Up; but what replaces it is hardly more interesting---really just forgettable recollections of better riffs from the band's past. Mike Mills provides the majority of the backing vocals as he did in the band's glory days---yet the best harmony on offer is a silly \\"woo-hoo\\" lifted from Blur's \\"Song 2.\\" And permanent fill-in Bill Rieflin provides the live beats that fans have been pining for since Bill Berry's departure; but for all his playing adds to the record he might just as well have been a drum machine.    Meanwhile, Michael Stipe reaches for the kind of inspired nonsense that he used to pack into every lyric, only to come up with a lot of over-obvious tripe. It's shocking to realize that the guy who wrote lyrics like \\"Driver 8,\\" \\"Losing My Religion\\" or even \\"E-bow the Letter\\" now can't manage much beyond ham-fisted couplets like this (from \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\"): \\"Death is pretty final / I'm collecting vinyl.\\" Granted that's a reasonably cute line, taken with enough irony---but there was a time when Stipe's best lyrics were impressively literate, not deliberately dumb.    The album's best songs mine the shambling drone of \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" to create something that at least superficially sounds kind of cool (\\"Man-sized Wreath,\\" \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" \\"Mr. Richards\\"). But \\"best\\" turns out to be a relative term here: placed amongst the songs from Monster or New Adventures in Hi-Fi, the most memorable of these tracks would probably wind up stuck on a b-side somewhere.     I keep listening to this album over and over, waiting for one of the songs to make a real impression on me---but they just don't. For all its blaring guitar sounds and hyped-up tempos, Accelerate far better deserves the rap that's been pinned on its underrated predecessor Around the Sun. It's bland, it's boring, and it's pretty much unnecessary.
0785125965|3.0|World War Hulk is the comic book equivalent of a summer action movie: long on action and fun, but short on plot.  If that appeals to you, then grab your popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!  Pretty much the same thing happens in all 5 issues: a succession of Marvel's heroes all line up to stop the Hulk, who's madder than he's ever been -- and one by one, they all fail.  Up until the last issue, which seemed a little cliched (see spoiler alert below).      The Hulk has always been one of my favorite characters, and it was nice to see him in a big \\"event\\" comic which affects other Marvel characters.  Then again, it doesn't really affect other characters much, because, by the end, lots of people have been beat up, and lots of property damage has occurred, but nothing else really changes.  Nobody dies, nobody's life is changed, and the status quo is pretty much the same at the end as the beginning.    The fact that the Hulk is prepared to wipe out the entire eastern seaboard makes it a little hard to root for him.  And the fact that no heroes have any success at stopping him makes the storyline seem a little repetitive -- like it doesn't really matter what anybody tries next, because the result is only going to be the same as with the last hero who tried.  That is, until the last issue, when ...[SPOILER ALERT]... the Sentry fights Hulk to a standstill, and the Hulk finally calms down.  Sentry is referred to all throughout the book as one of the Hulk's closest friends, and the one character who could always calm Hulk down, which does build up anticipation for the final battle, but to me it also raised another question: Who in the world is the Sentry?  I've collected almost 250 Hulk comics, from each decade that the Hulk has been published, including all issues of the then-current \\"Incredible Hulk\\" series that ran at the same time as WWH, and I'd never even heard of Sentry before.  When did he and Hulk meet?  How did they become such close friends?  Sentry seemed a little like adeus ex machina, thrown in to give the storyline some resolution.  It would have made more sense if the final character who turned the tide had a more familiar history with the Hulk (like Rick Jones, She-Hulk, Leonard Samson, the Bruce Banner persona, or even the recently-resurrected Betty Ross).    Well, these are all criticisms of the story, which is fairly pedestrian.  But most people won't buy this for the story.  As a simple, straightforward action story, which shows \\"the Hulk doing what he does best,\\" this book is a lot of fun.  He smashes everyone and everything in sight.      The strongest selling-point for this book is the art: I have seen about 40 artists portray the Hulk, and John Romita Jr. is one of the best, and probably my all-time favorite -- and here, he cuts loose like never before.  One reason for the paucity of story is the high number of splash pages and oversized panels, which really show off JRJR's beautiful art.  He captures such rich emotion in the faces of the characters, and his Hulk displays a primal ferocity which almost makes you feel his anger yourself.  Also, the covers by David Finch (if they're reprinted in this volume) are wonderful -- easily equal to the gorgeous covers Ladronn put out for the earlier \\"Planet Hulk\\" issues.      If you're interested in a smash-em-up fun-read, or if you're upset with the way Marvel's \\"Civil War\\" ended, then you'll probably like this book, because two of the strongest proponents of the \\"Superhero Registration Act\\" (Iron Man & Mr. Fantastic) are among the first to get it.  If you open it up expecting a prolonged, intense, lavishly-illustrated battle royale, involving all sorts of superhero guest stars, and you don't expect much in the way of plot development, you won't be disappointed.
0061245097|5.0|When her pathology reports told Don that Catherine \\"Cat\\" Crawford was not totally human, he blackmailed her to be the leader of his branch in the Homeland Security. Cat is a hybrid of human and vampire. Her team is affectionately known as the \\"Death Squad from Hell\\". She had previously left her lover and mentor, Bones, as an act of mercy, when she disappeared from Licking Falls, Ohio, and left her old life behind. Cat's team hunts down and kills creatures of the night. With every vampire she exterminates, Cat hopes it was her biological father.     As the story opens, Cat is after an old and powerful vampire called Liam Flannery. She is only a second away from twisting her silver knife and ending his existence when she learns he is Bones's sire. To repay Bones, Cat let the vampire escape. However, Flannery is a collector of rare things and he now wants to collect HER. Add to this, someone has put a bounty on her head and every super natural being is after the Red Reaper, her nickname among the supes.     When Cat least expects it, Bones reappears in her life. Bones has been searching for Cat ever since the night she disappeared. They have unfinished business to attend to. Knowing of the bounty and Flannery's infatuation with Cat, Bones is determined to stick around whether Cat likes it or not. One thing is for sure, Cat's team members do not like it one bit. They tolerated her being half vampire and it took awhile for them to believe she would not succumb and become totally vampire. Cat earned the respect of everyone on her team. But they wanted nothing to do with Bones, nor for Cat to have anything to do with him. Too bad, because Cat and Bones are still attracted to each other and are seriously considering continuing where they left off.     ***** This is the second book in the Night Huntress series. It picks up pretty much where the last left off. The author let readers watch as Cat went from amateur to pro in her Night Huntress skills. Doing so was a stroke of genius, in my opinion. I watched a normal girl slowly become a deadly assassin, making the character very realistic to me. I came to thoroughly understand Cat and to care for her. The other characters are just as well developed. Filled with almost non-stop action, a romance, and more than a few new twists, this story will sky rocket straight to the best seller lists! Jeaniene Frost has found her niche! *****     Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.

This book and The Road Less Traveled by M Scott Peck helped me deal with my ego based psychological problems at the time. These two books were very influential in helping me to finish college and move on with my life. Now I read books by Deepak Chopra and Eckhart Tolle which help me but these books were powerful stepping stones during that period in my life. Recommended for anyone who wants to read and be motivated by the power of the human spirit.
0064407667|5.0|The book The Bad Beginning is a tragic, serious, and sometimes funny book. This book begins with this interesting choice of words from the author. \\"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better of reading some other book. In this book not only is there no happy ending there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle.\\" This book is about three kids, Violet, the oldest sibling, is an inventor; Klaus, the middle child, is a researcher and a reader; and Sunny, has four very sharp teeth, and likes to bite things. This book begins with these three kids on Briny Beach, receiving the news that their parents along with their mansion and all their possessions have been destroyed. After this they are forced to live with one of their relatives named Count Olaf, who makes them do chores that you wouldn't make a child do, like cut firewood or paint a house. While being talented the orphans are also inheritors of a huge fortune that they will get when Violet turns eighteen, and Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get it.    In my opinion this book is the best book of all time. It is great because of how Lemony Snicket writes the book; he builds suspense throughout the story, and adds new twists into the plot. Another thing that makes this book so great is just how sad and depressing it can be but still have some points of happiness. One other thing that makes this book so great is that it discusses real life issues like, child abuse, adoption, and the amount of power a parent should have over a kid.
B001437DMA|5.0|My dad introduced me to the sounds of Joe Satriani back in 86'.  My first album was Surfing With The Alien.  At the time, my dad went in and asked an associate in a local Atlanta store,\\"who is the guy right now?\\"  Joe is still the guy.  My favs on the current album are tracks 1, 3, 9, & 10.  Music is supposed to be a great many things.  Joe seems to know this.  There is always growth on a Satch album.  There is also just great music.  Growth - growth for Joe - on this album: voice box on \\"I Just Wanna Rock\\", opening rythm and percussion on Aysik Vasel, opening spanish guitar on Andalusia.  Further experimentation on \\"Musterion\\" comes from \\"Searching\\" off the album \\"Is There Love In Space\\".  He uses piano/organ a bit more.  Could he do more with rythm and percussion?... maybe.  There are people out there who already do.  If that is what you want go get them.  When or if Joe does that, it will be well worth listening to.  In the meantime, pick up this album.  It will so (5 stars) not disappoint.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns     Khaled Hossini, the author, has made me cry with a story; this time not about two boys but two ladies who face difficult times.     Khaled Hossini after leaving Afghanistan almost twenty-eight years ago still remembers the country and its hardships, because of this I rate this book a five out of five as the best book I have ever read.     This story starts in a city in Afghanistan called Herat in which we meet a little girl called Mariam. This girl is one of many daughters and has a lot of step mothers. From the point of view of Mariam's mother her father Jalil could care less for her, you are led to believe this because the other children and wives live with Jalil in a big house and Mariam lives in shack. This book tends to switch main characters; we meet Lalia who likes school and has a crush on Tariq at age 14. Tariq is a boy who only has one leg and in there years have been Lalia's best friend to a boyfriend. Lalia is a character that is kind but sad with the fact that her dad should have lived and not her, because of a bomb hitting her house.  Lalia and Mariam the main characters who may seem to have different lives come together in an unexpected twist in a very interesting way. The author's style is wonderful he changes the points of view and every character seems to have different lifestyle which must have of been hard for Mr. Hossini to come up with.      In the book we see more wrong, than right we see more regrets than love, and most importantly more death than life.
B000G7599Y|5.0|I agree wholehartedly about the musical and sonic quality of this new edition of Mozart's symphonies. I would only add thai this is it's fourth updating. It first appeared on LPs in 1969, then around 1988 as a CD issue, follwed about 12 years later by a sonically improved edition. This one is even further improved, sonically best of all, and a lot cheaper also. It should also be noted that it offers not only the 40 numbered symphonies, but a total of 47 symphonies that includes several unnumbered but authentic works, one of which has been attributed to W.A.'s father, Leopold Mozart.
B000K3T89G|4.0|This is an interesting work of non-fiction that, at times, reads as if it were a novel. Based upon the recollection of a secular Austrian Jew, a young woman named Edith Hahn, the book tells the reader her intriguing story. During the Holocaust, she married a member of the Nazi party whom she had told she was Jewish. He married her and kept her secret. In the waning days of the war, her husband was drafted into the German army and ended up a prisoner of war for a time. Upon his return, he found a crumbling German infra-structure, the Nazis out of favor, and his Jewish wife asserting herself as she really was, a well-educated, independent woman.<br />This is essentially a book about Ms. Hahn's life just before, during, and just after World War II. It tells the reader about her life in Austria before the Nazis took over. She was a well-educated woman studying to be a lawyer, when the Gestapo put an end to her professional aspirations. She was sent to work at a labor camp and while doing so, her mother was deported to a concentration camp, before they could be re-united. Seeing that the writing was on the wall for the Jews of Austria, she went underground with the help of a Christian friend and fled to Germany. It was while she lived an underground life in Germany under an assumed name, that she met Werner Vetter, a Nazi party member who fell in love with her. Notwithstanding her confession that she was Jewish, he married her and never betrayed her.<br /><br />She tells a tale of sublimation of self in order to survive the rigors of the policies of Nazi Germany that were imposed upon Austria, her country and a land where anti-Semitism was rife. She tells a tale of sublimation of self in order to survive her marriage to a person whose views were so opposite her own. Her fears of discovery were so acute that during childbirth, she refused to take any pain medication or anesthesia for fear of betraying her own self while under sedation. Her only child, a daughter, Angelika, is believed to be the only child born of a Jewish mother in a Reich hospital in 1944. Though Edith loved her husband, she never felt free to be herself until the war was over. Hers is a story of immobilizing fear and survival.<br /><br />This is an intriguing perspective on the Holocaust from the voice of one who who was in a singular position during the latter half of the war, as she was a Jew in Germany., is believed to be the only child born of a Jewish mother in a Reich hospital in 1944.

0525950079|2.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth because it informed me while entertaining.  The characters were compelling and I cared about their lives.  At the same time I learned a great deal about Cathedrals and their construction, information that a truly enjoyed.  This World Without End was a great disappointment.  I stopped reading about 40% in because I do not care about the characters, I have learned nothing of interest and I still could not tell you what the story line is.  I have never read a \\"romance novel,\\" so I hope that I do not offend that genre's fans by saying that WWE reminded me of the stereotype of a romance novel, the story and characters are secondary to the detailed description of sex in as many increasingly unlikely circumstances as possible.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it as age 13.  A real disappointment.  I love historical fiction and will end this review with a recommendation that readers unfamiliar with Conn Iggulden's work should check it out!
B0002SG1OY|5.0|Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) marks the first album that sounds more mature than previous efforts by the Kinks, and indicates the theatrical direction Ray Davies would take very shortly.      The songwriting is, once again, truly magnificent.  You have to give Ray Davies respect where it's deserved- the man has proven he can write a collection of memorable, highly melodic, and diverse songs time and time again.      One thing that absolutely *floors* me about this album is just how much of it focuses on the topic of war.  \\"Some Mother's Son\\" is the first time in HISTORY I believe, that I ever cried upon hearing the lyrics before the actual vocal melody sunk in.  It's especially weird to have the lyrics click before the vocal melody when it concerns a band like the Kinks- the masters of pop songwriting.     The part in the song about a soldier looking up to the sun and reflecting on his childhood days... this is truly some of the most moving stuff I've ever encountered in pop music, and definitely indicative of some top-notch lyric writing skills.  The melody itself is brilliant as well.    Another song that immediately catches my attention is \\"Australia\\".  The vocal melodies in the first half of the song are layered precisely in a way that feels complex, and they really are highly enjoyable vocals once everything clicks.  The second half of the song features something I always wondered whether the Kinks could pull off- a lengthy guitar jam.  The answer is an astounding YES!!      A hard rock band like the Kinks (originators of hard rock, in fact) should definitely be showing the world what their guitar solo skills are like.  The guitar work on this track is amazing the entire way through.  Just a wonderful song.    \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\" is another highlight.  The subject of war was definitely on everyones mind back in the late 60's, and when the Kinks mention soldiers and wars, it really feels incredibly realistic and believable.  This song floors me just like the rest of the album.  You really sit there and actually *feel* what kind of emotions a soldier goes through during the heat of the moment, and this is thanks to some really spectacular lyrics.      \\"Shangri-La\\" is another display of honest emotions backed up with memorable (and quite sad, might I add) vocal melodies.  This is a terrific song.    Alright, if I had to pick one song that doesn't quite excite me like the rest of them do, it would be \\"Arthur\\".  A bit repetitive, but impossible to deny its immediate catchiness, so that definitely saves it.    Overall, wow.  Absolutely incredible album.
B001152TL6|5.0|Ok I like David Lynch movies and TP so I'm biased a bit. LH is another good Lynch movie. It's not linear and there are several ways to interpret how the different story lines are related. I won't mention how I interpreted it to avoid spoiling it for others. It reminds me of a movie I saw in middle school about a Civil War deserter(?) about to be hung at a bridge when he imagines a different reality. The soundtrack is great.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|If you value your lunch (or dinner) don't watch this movie.  The whole thing is filmed in what I call the \\"shakey cam\\" style and if your prone to motion sickness you WILL be sick before the movie ends.    Some of the reviews on here say good things about the acting, but I don't see how you can tell if the acting was good.   The shakey cam was so bad that I spent more than half the moving looking away from the screen.  From what I could here the dialogue was mostly \\"lets get out of here\\", \\"Dude where are you going\\", and \\"Aaaaaa oh god oh god\\".    I thought the big monster was goofy looking, and the small ones were rip offs of the bugs from Starship Troopers (another horrible movie).    I wish I could give this movie negative stars.
0061245097|5.0|One Foot in the Grave by Jeaniene Frost was a delicious treat. They say that each vintage gets better than the last and that is ever so true here.

She's beautiful, bitchy, lethal, sex deprived, fantastic at her job and she's the girl that every vampire seems to want.<br /><br />Bones is a vamp that any woman in her right mind or not would definitely love to spend some one on one time with in bed. Sexy, dangerous, great sense of humor for a vamp, possessive and 100 percent raw male.<br /><br />Cat is still walking around with a vendetta but now has a team to help her. Being a half breed vamp/human gives her many of the lovely things that give vamps their nasty name. As with the first book of the series, Cat is still looking for her father to make daddy dearest pay dearly for what he did to her mum. Also, she is just as determined to rid the world of as many blood suckers as she possibly can without getting herself killed. More determined than ever, Cat is a one woman cyclone hell bent on swathing a path of destruction miles wide.<br /><br />The story bends and twists so much that you just don't know what to expect around the next corner.

B0016K40KY|3.0|Lawrence of Arabia Movie Review:<br /> From the beginning of the movie Lawrence of Arabia seems non-intellectual, disrespectful of authority, and rebellious. He constantly tells everybody, \\"I'm different\\" as if he has a chip on his shoulder. The wardrobe mistress even claimed that they designed Peter O'Toole's wardrobe so his British Army uniform was messy, not ironed, and deliberately baggy. A motorcyclist calls to Lawrence in the desert, wearing his Arab get up, \\"Who are you?\\" and Lawrence has a profoundly puzzled look on his face. Isn't this the dilemma of the 1960's when the film was made and released --- who are you? For the rest of the movie this 1960's theme takes over as Lawrence experiments with different identities in a hippie-like fashion, attempting to discover the meaning of life. He confides to Ali, his Arab pal, played by Omar Sharif, that his father didn't marry his mother. His name is Lawrence. His father's name was Chapman. Ali suggests he call himself El Orens. Lawrence puts on new clothes, his Arab ones, and experiments with this identity. When he gets imprisoned and flogged in Deraa, he becomes disillusioned and decides to go back to being a British officer. The film suggests that Lawrence continued in this fashion to the end of his life when he died in a motorcycle accident, experimenting with speed as a new identity. The 1960's anti-war theme is also the theme of Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence starts out idealistic: he risks his life to save one Arab's life. But after Deraa he wants only revenge. He says that he will take no prisoners and engages in a killing frenzy. Instead of bringing out the romanticism of war, this film emphasizes its ugliness just as any draft-card burning campus protester would.<br /><br />Comment: Lawrence owned several Brough Superior motorbikes - very expensive models - and I don't think his accident was one of experimenting with speed as a new identity rather that he was simply riding a great motorcycle fast and the dip in the road hid two boys he had to swerve to avoid hitting resulting in his crash and death<br /><br />Comment: I agree totally that Lawrence was killed in an accident because he swerved on his motorcycle. Lawrence was not experimenting with speed as a new identity, but the producers, directors, and scriptwriters of this film seem to suggest he was. I suppose they were taking poetic license to make the persona of Lawrence fit the theme of their movie. They wanted to make him seem like an almost stupidly aggressive, belligerent person who doesn't think at all but just acts on impulse.<br /><br />Comment: I loved the romantic sound track.

B000Y7U98W|2.0|When I first saw a preview for this movie I was extremely intrigued.  A science fiction movie that deals with the end of our sun's life and man's attempt to save their star?  \\"Fantastic!  What a wonderful premise!  This should be a thoughtful film.\\"  Those were my initial thoughts, and they ended up being very wrong.<br /><br />For a while there at the beginning I thought that my initial impression would hold true.  There were intriguing elements, such as the question regarding what to do after finding the remnants of the first mission to save the sun.  Some philosophical questions were brought up and discussed, and the movie manages to remain suspenseful enough to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />Once I saw the video of the captain of the first mission ranting about god and all that superstitious nonsense, I got an eerie feeling that the movie was taking a horrible turn for the worse.  When we discover that the air lock between the two ships was destroyed manually, that feeling sunk in pretty fast.  (Remember when Brad Pitt's character knocks out the opposing fighter at the end of Snatch and that wobbly sequence with the close up of Jason Statham starts?  That is how I felt.)  You mean to tell me that the whole mission to save the solar system was destroyed by a christian who thinks god told him to send humanity to heaven?  And that realization is reached about 45 minutes before the movie ends?<br /><br />I almost turned the movie off and took it back to the store.  But instead I kept watching.  I watched as a roasted looking fanatic with new superhuman strength fights to destroy the second mission to save the sun.  I watched as he sneaks around in total darkness after his entire body, except apparently his eyes, was maimed horribly by extreme exposure to the sun.  I watched as the cast ran around the ship, which at this point was closer to the sun than Mercury, with no appreciable change in the effect of gravity.  I watched as the protagonist is able to ultimately defeat the superhuman messiah and bring the movie a contemporary Hollywood happy ending with a suitable level of irony.<br /><br />I am being generous when I give this film two stars.perhuman messiah and bring the movie a contemporary Hollywood happy ending with a suitable level of irony.

B00005JPS7|3.0|The movie starts off with the enemies being Arab terrorists who speak  Arabic and Urdu. Halfway through the film, Iron Man kills the leader of the terrorists and saves the villagers who were under the terrorists' rule. After that, the enemy becomes Jeff Bridges whose other identity is Iron Monger. Iron Monger is bigger in size than Iron Man, but Iron Man manages to defeat him. Both Iron Man and Iron Monger have lighted eyes, but Iron Man also has a lighted chest which could be the reason why he is able to defeat Iron Monger. The acting is good all around. Robert Downey Jr is one of the older actors to play a superhero but he doesn't look too old with a goatee. Gwyneth Paltrow's role as an assistant is not well defined and there is a question mark about her relationship with Robert Downey Jr. The movie has lot of talk about defense and weaponry, but nothing too complicated for the watcher.

And the ultra-positive \\"Give it to me\\" is one I play over and over in the car.  I, for one, am a thrilled to have positive messages in the music that's being sent out on the airwaves.<br /><br />\\"Miles Away\\" is a sweet and sentimental and \\"Voices\\" is an interesting, thought provoking song about a dysfunctional relationship (at least that's my take on it) quoting, \\"are you walking that dog?\\" and then later, \\"Is that dog walking you?\\"  Like many of Madonna's pro-women lyrics, I think \\"Voices\\" will at least encourage some people to take a look at an unhealthy relationship that they're in (well, one can hope, right?).<br /><br />\\"She's Not Me\\" is a sassy song that is catchy and fun - we all want to think we're different.  Again, another positive song is \\"Incredible\\" and then \\"Heartbeat\\" seems to resonate with most people.<br /><br />Overall, the album is stellar.  The producers couldn't be better.  Justin Timberlake, Timberland, and Pharrell are phenomenal.  It is a million times better than the other albums in the same vein currently released - and I get them all!  Madonna is still queen.  Can't wait for the tour!
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|It is like REM trying to cover themselves and doing a bad job.  Michael Stipe's lyrics are horrible.  He should go back to singing unintelligibly, and they should quit trying so hard.  Maybe, they should quit before it gets any worse.  Think Bill Berry!
B00003CXCT|5.0|A lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but here is the list for the complete Star Wars chronicles- all 9 episodes we've been promised for ages- all now available on dvd. I added in the occasional cartoon from over the years to show how the story actually started- through to the ever expanding storyline between Episode 2 and Episode 3.<br /><br />1. The Phantom Menace (1999)- Episode One<br /><br />2. Attack Of The Clones (2002)- Episode Two<br /><br />3. Star Wars Animated Adventures: EWOKS (Double Feature:<br />  The Haunted Village & Tales From The Endor Woods)(1996)<br /><br />  This 1996 cartoon series has 8 of the approx. 15 Season One<br />  episodes condensed into what they are trying to sell as 2 \\"films\\".<br />  However, the chapters are labeled by the original episode titles.<br />  The storyline here takes place between Episode 2: Attack Of The<br />  Clones and Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith.<br /><br />4. The Clone Wars (2008)- Animated Movie<br />  (The storyline takes place in between ATTACK OF THE CLONES and<br />  REVENGE OF THE SITH- in order for George Lucas to expand on the<br />  storyline more and of course add tons of new characters.)<br /><br />5. The Clone Wars animation series Season 1-5 DVD Boxset is now available,<br />  and contains the complete following: Complete Season One (2009),<br />  Complete Season Two (2010), Complete Season Three (2010),<br />  Complete Season Four (2011), and Complete Season Five (2011).<br />  I'm guessing this is being released now before Disney (who took over<br />  the franchise) releases the new Star Wars movie.<br /><br />6. Revenge Of The Sith (2005)- Episode Three<br /><br />7. Star Wars Animated Adventures: DROIDS (Double Feature-<br />  The Pirates & The Prince and Treasures Of The Hidden Planet)<br /><br />  This story line takes place after Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith.<br />  This cartoon series has 8 of the approx. 15 episodes from Season<br />  Two condensed into what they are trying to sell as 2 \\"films\\".<br />  However, the chapters are labeled by the original episode titles.<br /><br />8. A New Hope (1977)- Episode Four<br /><br />9. The Star Wars Holiday Special (aka Life Day Celebration)-<br />  (Nov.1978) - Episode Five<br /><br />  Face it, it has the same real characters from<br />  Star Wars- Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Chewbacca, R2D2,<br />  C3PO, etc., and it has a plot (a silly one) and is not a cheap<br />  cartoon, therefore, it is considered part of the continuing saga.<br />  Since George Lucas declared he will never release this on dvd, you will just<br />  have to find your copy on e*bay or ioffer or etc.<br /><br />10. The Empire Strikes Back - (1980) - Episode Six<br /><br />11. Return Of The Jedi (1983) - Episode Seven<br /><br />12. Ewoks Adventure: Caravan of Courage (1984) - Episode Eight<br /><br />13. Ewoks Adventure: The Battle For Endor (1985) - Episode Nine<br /><br />  (These 2 Ewoks tv movies are available on a 2-on-1 dvd.  If these Ewoks<br />  played such a huge part in the Return Of The Jedi movie, then why<br />  can't these 2 movies be considered episodes 8 and 9? They are the<br />  same Ewoks, not a cheap cartoon, and deserve to be part of the<br />  continuing saga.)<br /><br />Since George Lucas has now declared there will not be anymore Star Wars<br />movies, just the continuing cartoon series, like The Clone Wars, I have declared the above 9 episodes to now be the complete Star Wars chronicles- and it cannot and will not ever be changed.<br />***** UPDATE:  July 1st, 2013 - It now seems that after 4 seasons of the animated series THE CLONE WARS, George Lucas will now allow Hollywood to make more sequels of Star Wars... he was paid millions.  Oh well... now there will be more to come. Disney is the company that purchased the rights to Star Wars and will begin filming the next Star wars movie this year- 2013.
0446402389|4.0|This is a outstanding first novel. The serial killer plot is made all the more menancing by the creepy paranoia that pervades every facet of life in Stalinist Russia. Indeed, mere survial in such a relentlessly brutal society is at the heart of this novel -- the murders in many ways are a subplot. But the never-ending fear and the frustration the lead characters face as they come to grips with their relationship and who they are as individuals and the crimes they must solve makes for a highly suspenseful and entertaining read. I feel certain we'll see Leo and Raisa again soon.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I am glad to finally have the original 3 episodes (4,5 and 6) on dvd now- even though there aren't superior quality.<br />George Lucas has declared that there will not be anymore Star Wars episodes/movies because it is too time consuming, too much trouble, and perhaps because he has run out of ideas?  Anyway, I have declared the following 9 episodes to now be the official complete set in the chronicle series and regardless of what anyone says, it cannot and will not be changed. Ever.  Or until George Lucas gets back on his medicine and off his high horse, and realizes he has failed in presenting the complete 9 episodes he promised years ago, and makes amends by giving us the last trilogy we deserve. We need closure and so here it is:<br /><br />1. The Phantom Menace (1999) - Episode One<br /><br />2. Attack Of The Clones (2002) - Episode Two<br /><br />3. Revenge Of The Sith (2005) - Episode Three<br /><br />4. A New Hope (1977) - Episode Four<br /><br />5. The Star Wars Holiday Special (aka Life Day Celebration)<br />  (Nov. 1978) - Episode Five.<br />  (Face it, this tv special featured the same characters from the<br />  series- Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, R2D2, C3PO,<br />  Chewbacca, etc., and it isn't some lame cartoon, and actually has<br />  a plot- therefore, it is part of the continuing storyline.)<br /><br />6. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - Episode Six<br /><br />7. Return Of The Jedi (1983) - Episode Seven<br /><br />8. Ewoks Adventure: Caravan Of Courage (1984) - Episode Eight<br /><br />9. Ewoks Adventure: The Battle For Endor (1985) - Episode Nine<br />  (Both of the Ewoks movies were originally shown on tv, and are<br />  now available as a 2-on-1 dvd.  If they played such a big part<br />  in Return Of The Jedi, then why can't these 2 movies be part of<br />  the continuing story line?  They aren't lame cartoons, they both<br />  have plots, and therefore, must be accepted as episodes 8 and 9.)<br /><br />There really is no pointin making Star Wars a tv series (in place of giving us the real last trilogy set) because we already have a Star Trek,<br />Stargate, and Battlestar Gallactica.  So I declare the above list of 9<br />episodes to now be the official set of 9 in the chronicle series and it cannot and will not ever be changed. So take that George Lucas! :P<br />***** UPDATE:  July 1st, 2013  It seems after 4 seasons of The Clone Wars animated series, George Lucas has decided he will in fact<br />  allow Hollywood to make more Star Wars sequels... for millions of dollars. Oh well... at least there will be more. Disney is the company that purchased the rights and will be filming the next Star Wars this year- 2013.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Prior to watching Season One of \\"Dexter\\", I had already read \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" (the book upon which Season One of \\"Dexter\\" is based) and its sequel, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\", and considered them to be two of the best crime novels I had ever read. I really loved the characters of serial killer Dexter Morgan and his sister Deb. As a result, I knew it was inevitable that I was going to be disappointed by the \\"Dexter\\" TV series, and I was. Don't get me wrong, \\"Dexter\\" is an excellent TV series, but it's just not as good as the books.    The main continuing plot line in Season One of \\"Dexter\\" is about the ice-truck killer, a serial killer who kills his victims in cold places, drains them of their blood and then chops the bodies up into pieces. Whereas this story works very well when contained in a 300 page novel, when stretched out to 12 hour-long episodes (with numerous sub-plots added), it just doesn't work as well, it becomes too long and by episode 12, I was happy to have reached the end (something that I didn't feel with the book). Also, the Dexter of the TV series is different from the Dexter of the book. The TV series Dexter reminded me a lot of Angel, a brooding creature wanting to regain his humanity. The book Dexter is a lot more accepting of the fact that he is a monster, and a lot funnier as a result.     On the plus side, Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter (I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role) and my father, who hasn't read the books, really enjoyed the series. It is a well made series and is well worth watching. But if you do like it, I recommend that you read the books too.
B00144VBBS|5.0|The CD is ordered from old to new, allowing the listener to move through time.  Loved these the first time around and am enjoying them just as much this time too!
B00104QSOM|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece of cinema with this film.  I saw it three times at the theater, so I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  Daniel Day Lewis' performance is already something of legend, and will go down as one of the all time great film performances in history.  That's just one reason to see this great film.  This film works on you, tests you, and definitely gets you thinking and discussing it afterwards.      I am a big Kubrick fan, and this is the closest thing to Kubrick I've seen since his death.  It is ambiguous, just as the Plainview character is.  He's the new \\"Man you love to hate\\", and you can't take your eyes off him, as you try to figure him out.    An incredible parable on the struggle between religion and commerce, and the hypocrisy that exists in both.  Incredible cinematography, and musical score (which should have been nominated for an Oscar).  The only reason I gave this DVD only 4 stars instead of five, was because the extras were very, very limited, especially for a 2-disc \\"special edition\\".  No commentaries at all, which was very disappointing.  No real making of featurette, just some still photos, and production drawings.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This is an excellent rendition of Jane Eyre. The fact that it is four hours long allows for lots of detail and character development. It shows flashbacks of Rochester's past, which I don't remember seeing in other versions, and has the right amount of mystery and spookiness. I bought this movie for a gift, but I will definitely add it to my own collection.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This is the best album of the year!!! A varied selection of songs that are  well written, well produced,and exellectlly song. The more you listen to this album, the more you get addicted to it. From \\"Stump you Feet\\"(summer  song of 2008,\\"Iam a Fire\\"(number 1 dance song), to the \\"Queen in Back\\" and  the FAME (The Game), the VIOCE,the FIRE, the EMPERESS, is back.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Wasn't their best season (season 3 the sadly shortened-due-to-strike-season was probably the best thus far) but it is a great show with fun to watch actors and stories.  Ackles in particular is quite a find as an actor and should have a big career ahead of him if he chooses the right projects.  Get into the whole series.  It's worth it.
B00000DLV1|5.0|I read a review for Third in the New Yorker, and I found out that this live album existed.  I had to get it right away because the reviewer was basically saying that Third is great, but nothing can ever beat the Roseland NYC album.. I have to say that Roseland is genius and I am extremely sd to have missed out on it for so long.  Roseland really is a masterpiece.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural Season 3 is by far the best season in the series. Even though due to the writer's strike the show was reduced to 16 episodes it didn't end rushed as I thought it would.  At the end of season 2, a deal was made and at the end of this season it was time to pay up on that deal. The entire season finale was an 'on the edge of your seat, I can't believe that just happened, I can't wait until season 4' marathon! This season produced some of the best written episodes the show has ever had. No wonder The CW renewed for a 4th season months ahead of time. I'm so proud of this show for toughing out that sophomore slump and coming back for it's junior year with a vengeance. I can't wait until the fall and the 4th season starts!
B00104QSOM|5.0|--WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD--    This is the question I thought of near the end when the preacher Eli met his horrifying fate.  I was reluctant to see this film in theaters because I read that it was based on an Upton Sinclair novel.  Upton Sinclair of course being made famous as the author of \\"The Jungle\\" which supposedly showed horrifying depictions of the meatpacking industry which of course had no verifying evidence to them besides his few weeks as a socialist with preconceived notions about big business.  See my review of his novel \\"The Jungle\\" for an interesting history lesson.  At the same time though, I'm a huge fan of filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson.  His previous four films, \\"Hard Eight\\", \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Magnolia\\", and \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" were beautifully crafted and thoughtful works (\\"Magnolia\\" in my opinion being his best film, even compared to this one).  So eventually I decided to wait to see it on DVD.  The result is genuine surprise.  The movie doesn't at all come off as being some radical anti-capitalist screed at all.  The film could easily just be made about some politician or government bureaucrat (in fact, some of his speeches to townspeople throughout the film almost sound like many political rallies and addresses today).  It comes off more as an exploration of human greed and vanity then anything else, which exists in all systems.  Daniel Day Lewis is remarkable as Daniel Plainview, who isn't at all some caricature as some fatcat capitalist boss.  In the beginning we do see him working and laboring hard in order to get ahead.  When one of his employees dies in the film, he calls off production for a day.  And he does genuinely come to love his son whom he adopted from a man who died in a tragic accident (despite his protest at the end that he only needed a cute face in order to sell).  If one sees Paul Thomas Anderson's previous films, one notices that many of his characters are often at war with themselves.  \\"Hard Eight\\" featured Philip Baker Hall having a deep friendship and love for John C. Reilly despite his dark secret that he murdered the father of John C. Reilly's character.  \\"Boogie Nights\\" featured Heather Graham trying to obtain her G.E.D. despite her background as a porn star and being insulted for it in the beginning as well as her desire for a mother figure.  Also, Don Cheadle is shown in the movie wanting to start up a successful audio equipment store but being unable to gain a loan because of his background as a porn star.  \\"Magnolia\\" in turn featured Tom Cruise playing a machoistic motivational speaker who secretly felt saddened by his mother's passing from cancer and his father's having never visited her.  Juliana Moore was the second wife of his father who married him only for his money but grew to love him and felt guilt over it.  \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" of course had the shy and timid Adam Sandler at war over his shyness and weakness versus his burgeoning love for Emily Watson's character.  Ultimately after looking over these films, it makes since for PTA to pursue \\"There Will Be Blood\\" as its about Daniel Plainview's war with his business interests and his distrust of most human beings (at one point even claiming that he hates most people and doesn't see anything to like when he looks at most people) versus his love for his son and struggle to find something good in humanity.  He clearly loves his son yet abandons him after his son goes deaf because he doesn't know how to cope with his son's deafness.  Doesn't know how to tell him that he loves him.  In the end, he also doesn't know how to react to his son's leaving with his wife and starting up his own oil business in Mexico.  Ultimately he pushes everyone away because of his seeming inability to trust and cope with humanity (though perhaps mostly his own) that he ends up murdering the preacher Eli Sunday in a horrendous climax and remarking in the last line of the film \\"I'm finished\\", which I took to mean that he felt that that was the endof his life.  He believed that he was going to be arrested, tried for, and found guilty of murder since he had pushed everyone away, including perhaps the one good thing he had in his life, which was his son (coincidentally it's when he becomes separated from  his son both times in the film that he ends up murdering someone).    Eli Sunday is also perhpas an examination of the problems with greed in the story.  Granted he doesn't wind up a murderous psychopath like Plainview does and his murder at the end is tragic, but looking back on it, he isn't completely innocent since the only times he seems to have come forward to Plainview was when he wanted something in return.  After Plainview's son becomes deaf, Eli approaches him and what does he say?  Does he express his condolences, ask what he can do to help?  No, he asks where the $5,000 is that Plainview offered to pay him.  At the very end then, he returns from years of missionary work and investments to find Daniel Plainview passed out on the bowling alley floor and what does he do?  Does he ask why he was passed out on the floor of his indoor bowling alley?  Ask where his son is?  Ask how he is?  No, he asks if he would like to buy some land that he aquired and was trying to sell in order to cope with the Depression.  He wanted to sell it to Plainview at $100,000 plus the $5,000 that Plainview owed him with interest.  He was inconsiderate to the fact that a man whom he said was his friend was passed out on the floor of his indoor bowling alley.  Granted he didn't deserve his fate in the end, but he wasn't innocent of a little greed himself perhaps.  I have only two complaints against this film.  First, after his son, H.W., befriends the town girl, the movie flash forwards nearly ten to fifteen years in the future with them married and his son approaching his father to express his desire to leave the business and start his own business in Mexico.  Plainview becomes cold-hearted at this point and we don't know why.  Didn't Plainview even try to learn sign-language all those years in order to communicate with his son?  What disagreements did the father and son have that eventually would lead to the split?  Did something happen personally between the two or in Plainview's life to lead to this?  It's rather a mystery that leaves Plainview's descent into madness and murder believable (we're talking Daniel Day-Lewis here) yet perplexing and incomplete.  The second is that none of Paul Thomas Anderson's regulars are in here.  In his previous four films, he often had some actors and reappear in different films such as Juliana Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, etc.  Where are these faces here?  It would have been nice to see some of them just to help remember that this is a Paul Thomas Anderson film and not exclusively a Daniel Day-Lewis film.
1878424319|5.0|The four agreements are simple, and, yes, obvious.  What's not so obvious is what they *do*.  They keep you from receding back into the Dream, back into dealing with the *story* you have in your head about the world and the other people who are in it.  These are tools to keep you awake, to remind you that other people have stories in their heads about *you*, too, and most likely their actions are a result of reacting to that story and not to the actual you.  The four agreements help to disentangle the drama and hurt of day-to-day life, to stalk out the lies that we tell ourselves about what is happening to us and around us.  Read some of the one- and two-star reviews to see perfect examples of what Ruiz calls people who are caught in their dreams and unable to engage the observer, unable to relate to the world as it is.

0757302661|4.0|I have been very fearful about giving birth my whole life, until I read this book and a handful of others, claiming accurately that birth is NATURAL.  Mongan makes birth seem so precious and such a privilege, and I was able to change my perspective.      I had a very complicated pregnancy, and until about 33 weeks, was under the impression I would have to have a c-section.  A friend loaned this book to me, and I didn't crack it until my perinatologist said I would be able to give birth vaginally.  I hired a hypnobirthing instructor in my area for what turned out to be private lessons at a very reasonable cost ($100 for 3 sessions), and we \\"crammed\\" during the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy.    I hired a doula to help (who is also a midwife).  At the perinatologist's recommendation, I was induced.  My total labor, once I finally went into active labor, was 3 hours.  It was not pain-free, but it was not traumatic at all.  I requested drugs about 2.5 hours in, and they had no effect, so after the doctor informed me I was at 5 cm and broke my water, I screamed for the epidural.  When they checked my dilation, I was at 10 cm and baby's head was coming out!  No epidural, and baby was not affected by the previous drugs, but I was a bit loopy for a while after giving birth.  I pushed about three times and she was out.    I did not have success with \\"breathing the baby down,\\" and just held my breath and pushed when my body needed to push.  There is honestly NOTHING like the beautiful urge to push, and I am so thankful I was able to feel it and give birth as \\"naturally\\" as I could, with pitocin and a couple of other mild painkillers.  I attribute this to the confidence I gained about birth through Mongan's book (and Ina May's Guide to Childbirth).  Thanks to these two books, I do not have an unneccesary c-section scar.      Let it be said, that I did not get the anti-establishment tone from the book that other reviewers have mentioned.  From this book and my hypnotherapist, I went into my labor very willing to follow the OB's advice, if he decided to recommend emergency c-section.  My greatest concern was for my baby's safe delivery.  The hypnobirthing method taught me to relax and be calm and dignified no matter what the circumstances, and it's helped a LOT while raising my very active, energetic daughter.    I'll be buying my own copy of this book/CD in preparation for the birth of my son in 4 months.      My husband tried to help with this before labor, but he was absolutely no help during labor.  I think you can do this technique alone if you need to.    I have had friends who have tried this method with great success.  Two had 2-hour labors and one had 5 hours (all three had had previously 20-hour-plus labors).
B00005JPS7|2.0|I vowed some time ago to, once and for all, stopping handing over my time, money and brain cells to sequels, threequels, remakes and franchise.  So since this was the first time IRON MAN was being brought to the big screen, I figured I was safe and would be treated to a good, original superhero movie to follow in the steps of the original Superman, Batman, X-Men and Spiderman.    In my (surprised) opinion, no so.  While Robert Downy Jr's acting and spontaneous ability for dialogue and wit never fail to please, the story, for me, fell very short.  If this film is, indeed, based on the original comic book story of Iron Man, then the story failed to impress me.  In this film, it seems you spend more time watching the endless, ongoing process of how his superhero suit is created step-by-step rather than the action and the danger that you crave.  To make matters worse, I felt there were way too many stupid jokes and sight gags inserted into a film that I thought would be much darker, judging by the trailer I'd seen.    I'm afraid that IRON MAN gets thrown on the scrap heaps of bad superhero movies like FANTASTIC FOUR.  And Hollywood can rest assured that I will be going nowhere near IRON MAN II, III, IV, etc.

However, in this particular case, Steven Spielberg (my favorite living director) is a solid exception.  Having viewed the trailer, though, I can't help but wonder if this is going to be another weak, badly-acted story like TEMPLE OF DOOM, which I consider to be one of Spielberg's worst films.  The further thought of Indy having a silly sidekick named \\"Mutt\\" only makes me cringe to the memory of 1984's \\"Short Round\\", whom I personally wanted to strangle back when I first saw the film.    The clock ticks...

080701429X|5.0|Suffering, Meaning & a Worthwhile Life....    \\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity [as the Nazi death camps] is a psychiatrist worth listening to.  He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition with compassion.  Dr. Frankl's words have a profoundly honest ring, for they rest on experiences to deep for deception.\\"    So wrote Gordon Allport, Harvard Professor of Psychology and at mid-20th century, one of the great American psychologists.  What does Frankl say?  More vitally, what talk has he walked?    \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is not a boastful or an easy book.  But it is forcefully honest & gripping -- ongoing struggles, failures and flashes of success, brilliant success really.  Not so much in preserving sanity.  For who of us has the right to dare call insane anyone in a concentration camp who became overwhelmed or gave up?  Frankl's struggles, and the struggles of those around him, were how to keep humanely living in the face of what seems unfaceable.    As Frankl says, \\"...we had nothing to lose except our so ridiculously naked lives.\\"  If there's a meaning, a reason, a \\"why?\\" sturdy enough to bear that load, it must confront outrageous & unavoidable suffering.    I'm a psychotherapist; I work with many who suffer:  children severely abused & neglected, adults still caught up in their abuse, soldiers back from Iraq along with their spouses & children.  A label is easy & obvious:  PTSD.  Healing is not.    Frankl, writing well before we called this a \\"stress disorder\\" (Concentration camps = STRESS?  Can you feel how wrong it is to stop at the mechanics of stress?), shows us a deeper, more accurate, more transcendent reality & truth.  Struggling to find a worthy life in the face of suffering is not a \\"disorder\\".  In that struggle we can become profoundly sickened, and our risk of sickening is never far away.  But equally possible & present is a humbling choice:  we can honestly face our suffering and struggle to find (create, build, open ourselves up to, ....) our own meaning.  \\"Our own\\", in that it is individual to us, but it is never \\"just ourselves\\".    Through brutally-learned understandings & terribly-lived examples, Frankl shows us ways.  I fear quoting a few lines.  It feels like sound-biting & trivializing, not only misleading but obscene.  Frankl isn't about one-liners, though he writes many memorable lines & stories.  But lines pale when removed from their stories, their struggles to grasp onto meaning.    \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is short and easy-to-read, especially the first section, about the camps.  Read it.  Likely someday you'll be glad you did.

B000VBJEEG|4.0|The craftsmanship in a Pixar film is so startling that it's easy to take the genuine artistry behind it for granted given the studio's consistent run of hits since [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story]] over a dozen years ago. Like [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]] and [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars]], this 2007 confection runs nearly two hours, comparatively long for an animated film, with a story that demands more attention than most. Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind the [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]], returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance. Except for a few set pieces, especially toward the end, the movie is not quite as exhilarating as previous efforts, but there is no getting around its sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />The dense plot focuses primarily on Remy, an intellectually curious rat with a heightened sense of smell. He lives in a rodent colony in the French countryside headed by his wizened father Django, who uses Remy to smell everyone's food for possible poison. However, Remy has bigger dreams of becoming a chef like Gusteau, the recently deceased guiding light behind Paris' finest restaurant. While escaping from an old crone whose kitchen he has been using, Remy fittingly ends up at Gusteau's where he meets a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini. By hiding under Linguini's chef hat and pulling on his scalp like a puppeteer, Remy is now able to fulfill his dream of becoming a world-class chef. Thanks to Remy's culinary wizardry, Linguini becomes the talk of the town. Naturally, Linguini has to take credit for Remy's dishes and attracts the attention of fellow sous-chef Colette who has dreams of becoming a chef herself. No fanciful story like this would be complete without a villain, and this time, it is Skinner, the small, self-centered sous-chef who took over the restaurant after Gusteau's death only to cheapen the master chef's name by developing a line of microwavable food products to mass market.<br /><br />The rest of the story plays itself out in inevitable fashion but with plenty of clever twists and turns thanks to the perceptive screenplay by Bird, Jan Pinkava and Jim Capobianco, which focuses on the human qualities in the rodents. Needless to say, the CGI work is impressive, especially when the rats literally take over the kitchen. However, the visual realism of seeing the rats swarm in multiple battalions is a bit daunting to watch no matter how human Bird tries to make them. Despite the appearance of marquee names, the vocal casting is for the most part, merely serviceable. Comedian Patton Oswalt brings the right level of enthusiastic optimism to Remy's voice, while Brad Garrett (Gusteau's spirit), Ian Holm (Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (Colette) and Will Arnett (fellow sous-chef Horst) lose much of their individual personalities to their thick French accents. Lou Romano lends a fumbling callowness to Linguini, while Brian Dennehy is certainly recognizable as Django. The true standout, however, is Peter O'Toole who voices intimidating food critic Anton Ego with his usual theatrical flair.<br /><br />I'm surprised the extras on the 2007 DVD are relatively sparse for a major Pixar release. There is no commentary track from Bird, but instead, a 14-minute featurette with him and master chef Thomas Keller, who opened his kitchen at the legendary French Laundry restaurant to the animation team. This isn't Keller's first foray into cinema since he helped prepare Adam Sandler for his role as a celebrity chef in the execrable [[ASIN:B0007OCG56 Spanglish]]. The two best extras are the animation shorts. The first is the five-minute \\"Lifted\\" that preceded the movie in many theaters. It's an amusing take on the abduction scene in [[ASIN:B000VECAD0 Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]. Thesecond is the clever, ten-minute \\"Your Friend the Rat\\" which features Remy and his chubby brother Emile carrying on about the joys of being a rat and why we should love them, too. There are also three deleted scenes with introductions and plenty of previews from both Pixar and Disney.en-minute \\"Your Friend the Rat\\" which features Remy and his chubby brother Emile carrying on about the joys of being a rat and why we should love them, too.

0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" by Markus Zusak is an unusual, highly creative, captivating, and darkly enchanting novel. It tells the story of four years in the life of Liesel Meminger, a foster child growing up in Nazi Germany during the last years of World War II. We watch her grow from a frightened child of nine to a disillusioned and angry teenager forced to come to terms not only with the inhumanity wrought by Hitler's Holocaust, but also with her community's participation in it. Liesel's life is an uncommon story--one filled with both beauty and brutality. It makes for a riveting and compelling tale, and few readers, even those who find fault with the narration, will fail to be entertained.<br /><br />Liesel's life story is narrated by Death--a character who shares center stage along with the young girl as one of the book's most endearing and unforgettable protagonists. Death has a distinct fascination for this child. He rescues her autobiography from a garbage truck, and admits to having reread it thousands of times in an attempt to understand humanity. In the beginning of the novel, Death tells us: \\"in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt--an immense leap of an attempt--to prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.\\"<br /><br />The language of the narrative is brilliant in its originality. What makes this possible is the otherworldly point-of-view that Death brings to the narration. Through Death's eyes, our human world is seen anew with distinctly fresh and vivid prose. Death does not appreciate the difference between animate and inanimate objects, between people and things--thus his narration is filled with countless richly original metaphors that entertain (and yes, sometimes distract) the reader at almost every paragraph. Take these phrases for example: passengers \\"slide\\" out of a train \\"as if from a torn package;\\" a man wears \\"a face with the shades pulled down;\\" a woman \\"empties [her] words out into the sink;\\" books stand upright on a table \\"as if in conversation;\\" two words of regret are \\"giants\\" that a girl \\"struggles with, carries on her shoulder, and drops as a bungling pair at\\" a woman's feet; an exchange of gunfire is \\"a conversation of bullets;\\" and kind words \\"drop out of [a man's] mouth like jewels.\\" There is enormous reading pleasure to be had between the pages of this book merely by experiencing the narrator's richly creative prose.<br /><br />\\"The Book Thief\\" is being marketed as a young-adult novel, but it can easily be enjoyed and appreciated by adults. Although the story unfolds against a background of immense historical inhumanity, Liesel's story is one of courage, goodness, integrity, and compassion.<br /><br />This book has an overall fairy-tale-like quality, yet it deals with major themes concerning the human condition. I found this juxtaposition between the fairy-tale world and the real world jolting--for example, at times the character of Death entranced me, and at other times I felt his presence to be annoying and contrived. Also, the construction of the plot, although highly original, made it difficult for me to believe in the story or its themes. The author constructed the telling of Liesel's story to be twice removed from any adult reality: first, the story is written down by a young girl who naturally lacks a reliable understanding of the full breadth of human experience; and second, the story is read, reinterpreted, and retold by Death, a character who acknowledges his complete inability to understand the human experience. Yet, we the readers are supposed to derive deep understanding about the human experience from these two unreliable narrators.<br /><br />The fairy-tale-like quality of the work made it difficult for me to give credence to its weighty main theme, namely: given all the pain and inhumanity inherent in the human condition, is there still sufficient value in human existence? In all likelihood, the young adult reader will come away from this book answering this question with a resounding, \\"Yes!\\" But the adult reader may want more complexity and reality from a novel dealing with such a serious theme. For the adult reader, I believe the book succeeds better with its secondary theme concerning the enormous power of words to do good and bad in the world.<br /><br />As a young-adult novel, \\"The Book Thief\\" succeeds admirably. Its words are powerful and do good in the world.  I recommend this work and eagerly look forward to reading more books by this gifted writer.all likelihood, the young adult reader will come away from this book answering this question with a resounding, \\"Yes!\\" But the adult reader may want more complexity and reality from a novel dealing with such a serious theme.

B000AMJC2K|3.0|I bought 2 of these - one for my little 17\\" secondary monitor and one for my wifes 24\\" primary montor.    On the 17\\", everything went very smoothly and setup was simple. The one issue you should keep in mind with this arm is that it's tight - very tight, so when you attach a lightweight monitor to it, you'll need more than average force to move it into place.    On the 24\\", things were more interesting. Technically, this arm isn't rated for a monitor this large, but as I've discovered with other arms, the size of the monitor is mostly irrelevant - it's the weight you have to keep in mind and the 24\\" monitor fell under the weight this arm is rated for, so that wasn't the problem. The issue we ran into with this montor arm is not really a \\"full range of motion\\" arm. Its range of up/down movement is much more limited than you find on other, more expnsive arms - at a guess, I'd say you only have 20 or 25 degrees of motion you can move it through. This meant that we couldn't actually mount the arm where we wanted to on her desk and had to find an alternative, which, after an hour of futzing around, we did and all was well.    So, while this is a fine arm for the money and definately better than any others I've seen for this price, you do get some limitations that come with it. Overall, it's perfect for my small 17\\" secondary monitor, but if I were buying for my wifes monitor again, I'd probably buy another [[ASIN:B000BUK7KW Ergotron LX]] like I use for my 28\\" main montor because of the overall range of motion it gives.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|New Testament album. Awesome. Their first real \\"thrashy\\" album since Practice What You Preach im my opinion. Not much to say other than if you liked their 80's material, then you will like this. Formation of Damnation combines the speed of their early albums (Legacy) and the production of newer albums (Gathering). Paul Bostaph (ex-Slayer) sits in for the drums on this record and, of course, does a stellar job. Funny, because the last Testament album had Dave Lombardo of Slayer on drums. Testament knows how to pick `em well! Anyway, Testament did not reinvent themselves in any way shape or form. However, they did create a great new collection of heavy thrash tunes that are just as enjoyable as their old and newer material. I recommend this album to fans of both the older and newer material by the band. Great record.<br /><br />P.S. You would have never guessed that Chuck Billy had throat cancer. He sounds like he always did. Loud and proud. Buy this record.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I've always been a big Donna Summer fan but was quite afraid of the new album Crayons. After 17 years of absence from the music scene with a complete full length album, one might expect too much from an artist who's been around for four decades (70s-80s-90s-2000s...). The industry seemed to want Donna Summer to come out with a 'standards' album (as Rod Stewart and many other artists did with great success) but the 'Dance Diva' seemed to know better. She surrounded herself with young writers-composers-producers to create what I consider the perfect album for the summer of 2008 ! All tracks are surprisingly uplifting and current coming from a pop artist who will soon be 60 years old (might we remind ourselves). Donna Summer is in her own right the 'Queen of Dance' and she is quite back in fact as one of the songs suggests 'The Queen is Back' with nothing to prove and yet with everything to reaffirm ! With this album, we find a classic soulful and stronger than ever voice who sings along with the sounds of today, and you know what ? It feels really good to feel like time hasn't passed... Donna Summer delivers more than what I expected. She found a way to be true to herself while stepping into the 21st century with a new sound. My summer of 2008 will be a memorable one thanks to Donna ! And now I secretly wish she would come out with a new album every year from now on to always accompany my future summers... An album to listen to with sunshine in the face and wind in the hair ! Thank you Ms Summer for coming back !

0345495004|5.0|Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 - 1959) is arguably America's greatest architect.  This is a sweeping statement but one that the man himself would have been swifter than anyone else to acknowledge.  Wright was without a doubt a creative genius in the molding of space to create buildings in which people lived and worked.  Wright was also supremely confident about his abilities, never missing an opportunity to promote himself.<br /><br /> Wright was also adept at gathering around him a group of men and women architects who in concert with his ideas, brought about a revolution in how homes were designed in the period immediately following the  year 1900.  It has taken a hundred years and more for some of these men and women to have been given their due as contributors to what has come to be called the \\"Prairie School\\" of architecture.  They include such figures as George Grant Elmslie, William Purcell, John van Bergen, William Drummond, Isabel Roberts, Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin.  They called themselves \\"The Chicago Group\\".<br /><br /> For most of the twentieth century, architectural historians tended to take Frank Lloyd Wright's own estimation of the development of the prairie style as gospel.  In the past twenty years or so, more and more of these architects--men and women--have been studied and appreciated on their own merits.  While we may understand that to acknowledge what these other architects did is not to diminish the contributions of Wright, Wright's pattern was to de-emphasize the abilities of those who worked for and near him.  This became more pronounced they years progressed, as his fame grew and as these architectural associates faded into obscurity or died off.<br /><br /> Wright reinvented himself at least three times in his long career, which stretched from the late 1880s to the late 1950s.  However, just as he was skillful in obscuring many influences of his architectural colleagues, so too, Wright was clever and often disingenuous when speaking or writing about his personal life.  So, it is a happy addition to the hundreds of published books on Frank Lloyd Wright to have this historical novel, which stays closer and truer to the facts of the most infamous matter in Wright's life than did Wright, himself.<br /><br /> \\"Loving Frank\\" gives an account of the relationship between Wright and the former client who became his mistress, Mamah Borthwick Cheney (1869-1914).  It details the circumstances leading up to Mamah's murder, as well as the murder of her two children and other members of celebrated architect Frank Lloyd Wright's household at Taliesin, his sprawling hillside home near Spring Green, Wisconsin.<br /><br /> \\"Loving Frank\\" is a work of historical fiction; yet it is a model of verisimilitude. Nancy Horan has researched the facts in the lives of the main characters so completely that she addresses dates, times and places other Wright students have missed.  This is especially true of the time that Frank and Mamah spent away from their families on their sojourn in Europe.<br /><br /> \\"Loving Frank\\" begins in the home that Wright designed for electrical engineer Edwin Cheney and his wife Mamah Borthwick in 1903.  Architecturally speaking, the house is both celebrated and odd, even among Wright's unorthodox residences.  Unlike the standard two-and-a-half story turn of the century homes on either side of it, the house is low, and is screened from the street by a brick wall.  It appears to be a compact, single story bungalow, under a huge ground hugging hipped roof, but is in fact a large two-story house, with the main rooms on the upper entry level and auxiliary rooms on the lower, ground floor.  The Cheney Residence gives the passer by no sense of welcome, no invitation to draw near, no clue as to what might be going on beyond that brick wall.  It appears silent and secretive, vaguely Oriental, and thoroughly aloof from the rest of the streetscape.  Horan describes it in this way: \\"It had struck Mamah then that her low-slung house looked as small as a raft beside the steamerlike Victorian next door.\\" (Page 12).<br /><br /> While well-hidden from the public sidewalk, the Cheney house is not hidden from the neighboring houses, which in stately Victorian fashion, tower above it. The author uses this reality to dramatic effect.  She begins an account of the physical intimacy between Borthwick and Wright in the Cheney house, on the built-in living room couch by the south corner windows.  From there, the neighboring Belknap daughters can see Wright and Borthwick \\"spooning\\" as they observe the lovers from a second floor window in their house.  Thus begins what Horan calls \\"a summer of breathtaking risks\\".  (Page 27).<br /><br /> Horan offers an account of Mamah's growing dissatisfaction with conventional marriage and motherhood.  These both seem stifling to her.  Horan also describes how, at the same time, Wright found himself fin the middle of a full blown midlife crisis.  While his practice in the years leading up to 1909 was tremendously successful, he had explored the variations of the prairie style to such an extent that Wright sensed his work was losing freshness, appeal and momentum.  Wright was at the same time surrounded by a boisterous family that included Kitty, his wife of 20 years, their six children and, firmly ensconced next door, his ever-present mother Anna Lloyd Jones Wright.<br /><br /> Horan portrays Mamah Borthwick Cheney accurately, as a well-educated, modern woman with wide ranging literary interests, a former librarian and early feminist who admired social activist Jane Addams and anarchist Emma Goldman and who was Wright's intellectual equal.  Horan also shows a certain tenderness in Mamah that may have gone unanswered in her personal relationships.  It is impossible, however, to miss the fact that Mamah was also self-centered and foolhardy in deciding to cast her lot with Frank Lloyd Wright.<br /><br /> According to press accounts from the time, which Horan utilizes in her portrait of their viewpoints, both Mamah and Wright felt that their relationship was above social mores and beyond conventional laws.  Both of their spouses strived to maintain their marriages, refusing to grant divorces.  Finally, Wright and Mamah eloped to Europe; abandoning their homes, spouses and children.  The facts of Mamah's departure have not been recounted heretofore and the reader will no doubt be aghast at the cavalier attitude she takes toward the safekeeping of her children.<br /><br /> The scandal that ensued made headlines across the nation and brought Wright's American career to a standstill.  Horan portrays their time in Europe as one in which Wright prepared an elegant European retrospective of his architecture and Borthwick furthered her interest in the feminist movement through the influence of Swedish feminist Ellen Key (1849-1926), whose work is mostly forgotten except by specialized historians.  Horan helps the reader understand Key's philosophy and its appeal to the absconded lovers.  While in Europe Mamah not only befriended Key, she also undertook translating several of Key's works into English.<br /><br /> In the period between 1911 and 1914, Wright salvaged his career as best he could.  Edwin Cheney divorced Mamah and remarried.  Kitty continued to refuse to give Frank a divorce.  Upon Mamah's divorce (1911) from Edwin, Frank Lloyd Wright built a love nest for himself and Mamah on Wisconsin family land.  He used the cover story that he was building a house for his mother, Anna, and in fact Anna had paid for the land.  The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses.  Upon it, Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called \\"Taliesin\\" (named for a Welsh warrior whose name means \\"Shining Brow\\").<br /><br /> The home was an idyllic showplace typical of Wright's aesthetic, with low hip roofs hovering over an elongated complex of stone andstuccoed structures that combined living quarters for Wright, Mamah and their guests, with a workspace for the architectural draftsmen who were part of Wright's practice.  Situated on the brow of the hill, the house had commanding views of the valley below, as well as intimate garden courtyard spaces.  It was the talk of the region, as were its occupants, living together but still not married.<br /><br /> The pair might have settled into a lifetime of isolated tranquility had it not been for the as yet unexplained action of a deranged servant who, one noonday, on August 15, 1914, locked all the doors save one, set fire to the house, and systematically murdered Mamah, her two children and others of the Taliesin household.  Horan offers a poignant description of this massacre and its aftermath, as both Frank Lloyd Wright and Edwin Cheney made their way on the same train from Chicago to Spring Green to mourn their losses.<br /><br /> It is unfortunate that William R. Drennan's exceptionally fine non-fiction book \\"Death in a Prairie House\\" was not available to Horan as she prepared her work; it was published at just about the same time as \\"Loving Frank\\".  Drennan's analysis of the Taliesin murders is the most thoroughgoing by far, to date, and stands as an excellent companion piece to this novel.<br /><br /> As Horan demonstrates, their self-indulgent affair had a disastrous effect on both Mamah and Wright.  Wright would go on to obtain a divorce from Kitty only to wind up ensnared in a ludicrous marriage with the colorful yet psychologically unstable Miriam Noel.  Borthwick fared far worse.  As a result of her love for Wright she lost much in her quest for self-actualization long before her tragic death.  Even her mentor Ellen Key eventually became distant with Mamah because Mamah had deserted her children.  One wonders what Mamah might say about the choices she made. One also wonders whether Wright fully understood Mamah's level of devotion for him and how much she gave up because of it.<br /><br /> Nancy Horan's novel is well-researched.  Ms. Horan was for many years a resident of Oak Park and her daily walks took her past the Cheney House.  Out of the familiarity with the many Wright-designed residences there, she also coaxed the untold but remembered stories about the Wrights the Cheneys and their cultured social set.  Horan has delved into the oral tradition and expands upon it in a way that the events are fleshed out with feelings--she has attempted to answer all of the whys of the peculiar decision Wright made to abandoned his wife and six children, running off to Europe with the wife of one of his clients (who left her two children behind, as well).  The account of their sojourn in Europe while Wright was preparing a high quality volume of his architectural triumphs tells more than any work heretofore about that period in their lives.oth Mamah and Wright felt that their relationship was above social mores and beyond conventional laws.  Both of their spouses strived to maintain their marriages, refusing to grant divorces.  Finally, Wright and Mamah eloped to Europe; abandoning their homes, spouses and children.

Out of the familiarity with the many Wright-designed residences there, she also coaxed the untold but remembered stories about the Wrights the Cheneys and their cultured social set.  Horan has delved into the oral tradition and expands upon it in a way that the events are fleshed out with feelings--she has attempted to answer all of the whys of the peculiar decision Wright made to abandoned his wife and six children, running off to Europe with the wife of one of his clients (who left her two children behind, as well).  The account of their sojourn in Europe while Wright was preparing a high quality volume of his architectural triumphs tells more than any work heretofore about that period in their lives.
B00154GEFU|3.0|I am a diehard Asia fan - ever since 1982.  Even during the John Payne years when most people forget about them, I stayed loyal to them and own every album (studio, live, greatest hits, etc...) that they have out, but I am disappointed in this CD.  It kills me to have to say it, but I must be truthful here.  I don't want to burn these guys.  I think they are the greatest, but they could have done better with this piece of work.  I found 3 songs to be incredible (tracks 1, 3, & 7).  Three more tracks were okay and the other 6 tracks I don't care for at all.  I feel as though they maybe rushed this album and should have perhaps slowed down a little and taken more time on each song.  They recorded it between and during touring, so maybe they minds were more on touring then on creating new stuff.  Just one man's opinion.  I still love these guys despite being disappointed in this CD, but will always follow them and listen to their music.  I hope their next album is better then this one.
B001437DMA|3.0|Ever since my friend first turned me on to Satch I have collected everything I can and I have enjoyed just about all of it. I had high expectations for this new album and I enjoy 65-70% of it. The I just wanna rock would be so much better but it starts to sound like something off of Jock Jams or something. I love the guitar solo he breaks into then it hits..\\"WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE\\"?  \\"I JUST WANNA ROCK\\"!  ....eeeeeeh....<br />If Joe wants vocals on his music I have nothing against that...I'd just prefer it if he was singing. (i.e.:  \\"Lifestyle\\" )<br /><br />Other tracks like Musterion, Andalusia, Overdriver, and even the Itunes exclusive called \\"Ghosts\\" is pretty cool.<br />Joe you know no limits and you highly inspire...but please kill the jock jams.
B00132D808|2.0|I can't understand the thinking behind this crap.  There are maybe three decent songs on the entire album.  I liked PATD's last album; this was a total disappointment.  The good songs, Nine in the Afternoon, She's a Handsome Woman and That Green Gentleman, are really good songs.  Through the first 4 tracks, I had high hopes.  This cd belongs in some stupid musical...I can't get Mary Poppins out of my head when I listen to it.
B0000793ZA|5.0|1984 was the year the post-punk darlings across The Pond grew up ... well, maybe not The Cure who, upon releasing its babbling, tantrum-filled \\"The Top\\" that year, would continue to waddle back toward infancy. The Psychedelic Furs came out with \\"Mirror Moves,\\" adding a polish to its sneer; Echo & the Bunnymen dabbled in orchestral maneuvers on \\"Ocean Rain;\\" The Smiths arrived to fill a college-circuit Elvis niche; and U2 hired Brian Eno to babysit the band in the studio to great effect. Yet, in retrospect, perhaps the finest moment was instigated by the genre-hopping Simple Minds, who on \\"Sparkle in the Rain\\" would find their sound, then quickly be eclipsed by U2, whose frontman (future pope Bono) shared a similar singing style with Jim Kerr.<br /><br />Rediscovering the album a dozen years or so since I lost my original cassette, I am blown away by how much is going on in these songs -- especially the first three tracks (\\"Up on the Catwalk,\\" \\"Book of Brilliant Things\\" and \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\") -- yet how flawless and contemporary it sounds. The band's previous release, \\"New Gold Dream,\\" demonstrated the band's ability to carve out emotional soundscapes, but it lacked the energy and swagger that \\"Sparkle\\" spills through the speakers. By 1984, SM was an accomplished band that had dabbled in punk, art rock, synth and disco, and already had six studio albums under its belt, so it makes sense the band should outshine its contemporaries on No. 7. Yet, it's not the musicianship alone; there is a sense of earnestness here, a Walt Whitman \\"yawp,\\" if you will, that is lacking in other releases of the time, as well as any other Simple Minds release. Subsequent albums came off too grandiose; and on prior releases, Kerr either lacked confidence or purposely subdued his vocals.<br /><br />If you like contemporary bands inspired by the \\"Eighties sound\\" -- The Killers, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party to name a few -- this is the pinnacle of what they're trying to recapture. And when you pick this up and spin it around in your mind, you'll find they're not even coming close.up and spin it around in your mind, you'll find they're not even coming close.

0671646788|5.0|The Magic of Thinking BIG by David J. Schwartz is a well-respected self-development classic. Written in the 1950's it still makes good common sense today. The practical things in life don't change much with time - like the basic principles for achieving success and living up to your full potential.<br /><br />My copy of The Magic of Thinking Big has yellowed pages, sticky notes all over it, pink highlighted sentences on almost every page and yet, every time I take it down from shelf it's like opening a new wealth of information. I even remember exactly when and where I bought it. To me, that says a lot about the importance this book has had on my personal and professional self-development life.<br /><br />In fact, I listened to the CD last night to help get me ready for writing this review and I took four pages of notes. One thing I've found with the classic self-development materials, every time I read or listen to them for the second, fifth or even tenth time I found something new I'd never read or heard before.<br /><br />A really good empowering book/tape/CD/DVD should be read, listened to, watched and appreciated more than once. Every time we revisit a classic, we are in a different emotional and physical place than the first or second time we read, listened or watched it. It's like as we grow and evolve, so do the materials in the book.<br /><br />That's how I felt about listening to The Magic of Thinking BIG by David J. Schwartz last night. I heard things I swear weren't there before. The words in the book hadn't changed, I had. The human mind is a powerful success and self-development tool and that's exactly the powerful premise of this book.<br /><br />According to David J. Schwartz, it's really quite simple - if you want more out of your life, than think bigger. What makes this book a self-development/success classic? The success principles that have proven workable and viable for over fifty years and, are still true today: To make it big in life, you can't settle for small thinking.<br /><br />Your life today is a reflection of how BIG you're allowing yourself to think, dream and plan.  Dr. Schwartz guides you through The Magic of Thinking Big but the rest is up to you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for your success/self-development library. I wish for you that your copy becomes dog-eared and yellowed.

B00003CXXP|5.0|As many wish to paint a bright future for us all. This work was a good depiction of what could be.     It begs the question: What defines \\"a real boy\\" or humanity?     Most of my family thought the end was sad, but given some thought, realized that it was actually good. It throws your emotions all over. You see the good, bad, and ugly in humanity. The emotions of David's \\"Mother\\" - well played. Take special note of when David is \\"Imprinted\\" his change in expression... That kid can act! It is no wonder he landed the lead in Second Hand Lions.     Some may find themselves lost in this film as there are some assumptions to what the audience may understand about the subject matter - Certainly in honor of Stanley Kubrick, but not as lost as you were with 2001: A Space Odyssey (he begged Spielberg to do the movie but didn't until after his death).     I thought this movie was excellent - My taste.   For the price; excellent for all.

I was hoping that the Disc would have extra video material on the Disc, but with this Connect-D disc, the pluses are, the Booklet, the packaging, and the extras you can get when you connect to the web side and see the Video for Who made Who, the Photos, Audio with Angus and Stephen King, and etc. A real treasure trove. My only wish is that they would make the material on the website available on a disc at some stage, just in case it \\"disappears\\" at some stage.  All in all, whilst its not the top of the albums, its a must have for any ACDC fan.  RIDE ON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002B15XI|2.0|\\"M.A.S.H.\\", both successful on the big screen and its many years performing in our smaller living rooms, is an ensemble film that uses surgery, comedy, drama, fear, and football to finally tell its off-the-map story.  There is no denying that Altman's film was funny - it was a comedy - but where it failed here yet succeeded in the smaller screen was the cohesiveness of the story and the development of our central characters.  In small thirty-minute segments, we learn more about our \\"M.A.S.H.\\" in habitants than throughout the nearly two hours in the film.  From Donald Sutherland, to Eliot Gould, to even Robert Duvall, Altman's film never quite left the ground.  The story (or at least the little vignettes of it) were simple, the characters could have been multi-dimensional (yet simple), and the environment could have added to that overwhelming need for comedy, but instead Altman did nothing to connect these simple ideas.  Perhaps it was pioneering to see surgeons during the Korean War at work, but it added nothing to the overall film - no comedy, no insight, no charm - just a way to prove to the viewers that these men were actually men of medicine.  This was a cheap ploy that Altman did not use wisely.  \\"M.A.S.H.\\" had all the inner-workings of a great comedy, the scene was set, and the overhead announce had his funny lines, but, sadly, this film never quite found its stride.  From the actors to the continuity to the muddled themes, \\"M.A.S.H.\\" was genuine for its time, but watching it now, in 2008, it feels dated and overwhelmingly tiresome.<br /><br />What a treat it was to see the groundlings of such great actors like Donald Sutherland, Eliot Gould, Robert Duvall, and even Tom Skerritt.  To see these infamous character actors in their youthful prime is worth one star already, but that may be it.  We cannot fault Altman for not giving these characters souls, because they did.  Hawkeye had his whistle and martini, Gould had his brutal honesty, and well, Frank had his religion and his \\"Hot Lips\\", but alas, our guys never took them further.  These characters were strong in their individual moments, such as when Hawkeye is borrowing the Jeep at the beginning of the film, but, like the others, he suddenly falls flat and uncharismatic throughout the rest of the film.  Duvall's Frank was another character that could have been a staple through the rest of the film, but again, just jumped without reason and walked off the screen.  While we were not hoping for other war films just to be reinvented, we were hoping for some form of structure with our characters that would allow us to see their growth, see their souls, and give us a reason to follow them into the operating room or, oddly, onto the football field.  They had jokes that would make us laugh, words that would inspire, and goofiness that would only befit Altman, but there was something desperately lacking with our guy near the front line.  Sutherland was fun, but as I watched, he was Donald Sutherland in a G.I. outfit.  It was Duvall pre-\\"The Apostle\\".  It was Tom Skerritt being, well, Tom Skerritt.  This was the ultimate shortfall for this cast.  They could not shake their own personalities - their own selves for these roles.  Concluding with this feeble football game that came from nowhere (supposedly fitting in with the tangents of war), that gave us no emotional throwback for these characters - we were left with shells of what could have been.  This was a good movie, maybe lower than good, but greatness was in an earshot if only these fine actors would have tried.<br /><br />Aside from the actors, the story itself seemed a failure from the beginning.  Not knowing the original \\"theme song\\" to this film, the \\"suicide\\" song set the wrong tone for the beginning of this film.  Sure, the morbid nature seemed to fit with what was happening in the operating room, but during the off chance that we knew what was happening in there, it just didn't seem to fit.  Then, when the dentist hashis moment of sanity, we are returned to that same song.  It felt like one big clich&eacute; that Altman didn't want to acknowledge.  While the television music could not be shaken from my mind, this little ditty needed to be erased completely.  Aside from the song, mentioned before, there was just no story to this Korean caper.  \\"M.A.S.H.\\" would have been a stronger outing as smaller stories within one connecting story instead of trying to just keep it all continuous.  At one moment we are listening to Hot Lips and Frank, in another we are fighting for a Korean boy to not join his national army, and then to wrap it up, we are playing in a clich&eacute; football match-up with an outcome everyone expected.  It felt like Altman had the ideas; he just didn't know how to connect them all cohesively.  The thought probably being that he could connect them through the surgery room banter was not worth the printed reel, while the guy doing the announcements at camp was not a close enough second place.  I wanted to like the quirkiness of the characters; I wanted to see the juxtaposition of the tragedy of the war, with the comedy of the doctors.  I wanted to see Sutherland use humor to alleviate the blood of war - alas - this never happened.  I chuckled once during the big Hot Lips shower scene, and that was it.  There was a level of brevity with Altman's war-torn camp, but at times it felt more along the lines of apathy.  Nobody cared, nobody had heart, nobody showed emotion except for Frank, and he was less than a secondary character.  What was needed to make \\"M.A.S.H.\\" a stand out film was a big emotional element or characters with flaws, not the cheapened suicide song coupled with sexual escapades.  It just didn't work.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with the praise that Altman has received for this film.  \\"M.A.S.H.\\" may have been a pioneering film for the time, but over the years it has become more and more chaotic, and less meaningful.  Altman's control over his characters and story is non-existent, as he just added short story over non-connective short story in hopes to make at least a two-hour long feature film.  Add in Sutherland's semi-annoying whistle, and we have monumental film that seemed avante-guard for the time, but now just feel misleading.  Remember, this was pre-\\"M.A.S.H.\\" the television show, which was a defined comedy/drama show.  Looking back at the film, it did work in simple 30 minute segments, so perhaps Altman was thinking television while he made this - that would make stronger sense for the continuity issue.  Either way, \\"M.A.S.H.\\", with the cast and director had bigger hopes in my eyes, but was let down in the long run.  Time has nearly corrupted this film, and even with our current war standings - it just doesn't relate.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****anity, we are returned to that same song.

B0019J1JXI|5.0|After 17 years, Donna Summer has made it well worth the wait! She has put together a deliberate set of songs that span many different musical genres. This is why I have loved Donna so much. She really is an actress who sings. She can apply her voice into any direction she pleases. There are songs here for everyone. But I think the most important aspect for the album is that no matter what genre it is, the songs are superior. She had a hand in cowriting all of the songs. And in all of that, she did not abandon her dance roots. The songs here are mostly danceable. The most haunting song to me though is Be Myself Again. Donna is at her most vulnerable and it's beautiful. Other favorites are the new single, Stamp Your Feet, the #1 Dance Hit, I'm A Fire, Fame(The Game), Slide Over Backwards, Queen is Back, Mr Music, bonus track, It's Only Love, and the title track, Crayons with Ziggy Marley. Wow, Donna, with all this creativity back in full force, please don't make us wait another 17 years for the next CD! Music is not the same without you!!
B0000646UN|5.0|This is an above the average war movie, several kilometers (or miles) ahead of hollywoodland movies. Above all, it deals with the Finnish-Russian war during Second World War, a rather unknown chapter in that war. Outstanding work of acting overall. Very realistic. I have to admit though that 45 bucks is too much to ask, so I wish someone would soon provide a second edition of this film with some extras about Finnish directors or about historical facts that surrounded this movie.

In my latest novel, [[ASIN:1434368793 Standup Comedian: The Secret and Beyond]] I wrote, \\"The real secret is to always want that which is best for All That Is.\\"  Once a person begins to want that his or her ego diminishes in strength correspondingly.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I'll be 100% honest here and say I hate love stories. They are usually boring and predictable. I've enjoyed a select few, like The Notebook and Titanic, but never got into most others. Feeling random one day, I decided to purchase this DVD through amazon. I finally had the chance to sit down and watch it the other day and it was honest to God, AMAZING. The story was so realistic and heartwrenching. You feel like you are these two men. You actually can FEEL their emotions, both happy and sad. It's one of the best love stories of all time and also one of the saddest. Every minute of this movie is worth watching and I wish more movies could be so intense and amazing. This movie is a masterclass and everyone should have the chance to see it. Not only does it make for great entertainment, but it also makes you see people in a different light. I've never been homophobic, but if I was and saw this movie, I'd have a whole new respect for homosexuals. This movie helps you understand that love is love, no matter who anybody is with. It teaches you acceptance and that alone is a great reason to watch this dvd and support this wonderful director and these amazing actors!
1577314808|4.0|One often reads in spiritual works that a teacher will appear when the student is ready. I like to say that there is nothing that can be written that has not already been applied to paper, parchment, or stone. When the individual is ready he or she will be lead to the version that will resonate with them. That's why some love this book and others don't.<br /><br />I find the writing a bit tedious and redundant, but it does drive home the message about living in the now. That may or may not be a spiritual truth but it is definitely a psychological one. That's why there is so much hate in the world; people can't or won't let go of the past, and their drive to bring about their idea of a bright future clashes with the contrary desires of other egoic individuals and groups<br /><br />I rated the book a four because moving people to think about their mind-body thoughts and the resultant thought forms, the good and the bad, is a giant step toward personal and collective improvement and maybe even to enlightenment.

B000A6T1KE|2.0|Oh my, I believe this must be the worst Star Trek movie, if you look closely, it is indeed. The worst is that it could have been very good with the Romulans, but they totally threw it away with a totally unbelievable story. All bad reviews here are in most points absolutely right, I will add the villain's motivation: why Shinzon must blow Earth to pieces? Why does he hate Picard? In all Star Trek movies all bad guys have a clear and straightforward (and even understandable) motivation, even Soran in Generations. And 80 years later, after Kirk destroyed a cloaked Bird of Prey which can fire, the Enterprise-E missed a lot of shots, what the heck?! No evolution in weapons technology in the 24th century? And the Romulans only send two war spaceships to blast Shinzon?! Even the best Star Trek movies have plot holes, but this one is the mother of them all, totally bombarded area! And the car chase...the commentary says it all: Brent Spiner thought a car chase would be great...come on! Would'nt the Enterprise give a call to the team and warn them about approching lifeforms with plenty of time, or even before they went down to the planet?? The B4 subplot is pointless, anyway.    I could go on and on (enough have been said about the Wrath of Kahn rehash). It's sad that the producers and writers did not have the intelligence to write a good story, a lot of good fans would had come with better stuff, lets give it a try: The Romulan Empire is seized by a new bloody sovereign (no Picard clone or funny looking aliens, please), the Enterprise and Riker (at last promoted to captain) in his ship, The Titan, are sent as an olive branch, even some Klingon ship could be involved, but is a trap and all hell breaks loose as they fight along with Romulan disidents to turn the bloody sovereign and his fleet to space dust. There you have it, much better Nemesis in one shot!     The good things are few: I liked the dark tone of the movie, the FX and some space action sequences, the Enterprise bridge blown away was cool, but they are not enough to redeem a poor script and heartless execution.    Trek fans who despise films as The Motion Picture, The Final Frontier or Generations, should look twice: at least these movies, with all their faults, have a sense of adventure of some people doing star treking, those stories are faithful to Science Fiction; I despised Insurrection, but at least it raises a moral dilema (albeit very ligthly), but Nemesis is just a pointless and unsuccesful exercise in Science Fiction, drama and cinema.    I'm very sorry for the cast, for around 15 years they entertained us well, they deserved a better farewell. Since First Contact Paramount failed to deliver and the whole franchise is endagered, lets hope the new Star Trek will make it up to the fans.
6305910340|4.0|Having seen this film in the theatres when it first came out, I've always had a fondness for this film. So there is no need for explanation about why I've seen this film at least six times. It's got a marvelous cast, Laurence Fishburne, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, Joan Allen, Laura Linney, Dab Hedaya, William H. Macy, the list goes on. And what seals the deal is a breakthrough performance from first time actor Max Pomeranc, who shines as the seven year old Josh Waitzkin. The script was wonderful. But what else would you expect in 1993 from the screenwriter who penned Schindler's List? What was amazing though was that Zaillian also directed the film with as much panache and grace with which he wrote the screenplay. And to top it off, Zaillian found a way to shoot chess and make it exciting! I was so glad to finally buy this film, I'm going to show it to all my friends and show them what really good filmmaking looks like.

B0016B6ZKG|3.0|I was anticipating this release - Donna Summer?  Great catalogue, excellent vocalist (something that is often overlooked) and also a great songwriter.  I give this 3 stars for sentimental reasons;  maybe some of this will grow on me.      Production is muddled;  \\"The Queen Is Back\\" is so desperate since it reflects this collection - back from what?  Her last studio release, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" has more personality than this release.  I am disturbed that she had to resort to Britney Spears style production - Donna is a great artist and she pulled a Madonna - Lowest Common Denominator factor.      I don't know why she has had such label problems and has not put out some original material in a full length release in years - her recent singles have been great - but this is boring.  Sorry, Donna.  17 years?   This should have been \\"Once Upon A Time - Part Two\\" and dealt with her life 30 years after that aural masterpiece.  Like I said - GIORGIO?  Come back and help Donna, please!
B000TSIK14|5.0|I'm happy to say that the Scorpions are finally back and are on top. Klaus Meine, Matthias Jabs, Rudolf Schenker and company are back with 'Humanity Hour, Vol. 1,' which is their finest since 1990's 'Crazy World.'    The record starts off really strong with 'Hour 1.' This song is amazing, and it shows how well the group can play--24 years after the release of their huge hit 'Rock You Like A Hurricane.'    And the highlights just keep coming. 'The Cross,' a duet with The Smashing Pumpkins' leader Billy Corgan, is a huge highlight, and his voice and Meine's mix very well together.    Other highlights are '321,' 'You're Lovin' Me To Death,' 'We Were Born To Fly,' 'Humanity,' and 'The Game Of Life.'    Overall, this is one of their finest albums. It's right up there with 'Animal Magnetism,' 'Love At First Sting' and 'Blackout.'     If you like the Scorps even a little bit, than you're almost guaranteed to love this album. It's truly 'love at first sting.'    Highly recommended for any Scorps fan. An instant crowd pleaser. ENJOY!!!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I must admit we watched this movie purely because it stars Johnny Depp and we know we like most of the movies he's in.  We knew nothing more about the movie prior to purchasing it.<br /><br />Imagine our surprise when everyone in the cast (including Johnny) started singing!  It's a musical.  We were disappointed from the get-go.<br /><br />...but I must say, we actually enjoyed the movie.  It took about 20 minutes to get used to the format.  Not that I'm against musicals mind you -- I just prefer them at the theatre when I'm already prepared to hear all the actors sing their lines.<br /><br />The plot was interesting, and the ending had an unexpected twist.  I enjoyed the story-line very much.  The acting was great, the singing was okay, and the set and costumes were perfect.<br /><br />Be aware, this movie is VERY bloody.
0143038419|5.0|Although skeptical I thoroughly enjoyed this book and didn't want it to end. What lands her on the bathroom floor (men) certainly seemed a bit much to me which is why I was skeptical. I didn't want some melodrama about a woman's \\"man troubles.\\" But that's not the point. What lands her on the floor is her complete separation from who she is as a person. A theme many can relate to. The remainder of her story is her quest to find herself. I found her writing refreshing, honest, inspiring and funny. A lovely read with many great gems of inspiration sprinkled throughout.
0312263511|4.0|It's no surprise that it's well-written considering how many journalists (and potential co-authors) Gene Cernan knows.  It is accessible to all because they kept it non-technical.    The author keeps his family in the forefront and puts his wife and daughter on a pedestal.  He lets us in on how an Apollo astronaut's career could be a real marriage-tester due to his time away from home, and the wife being on stage.  I liked the way they chronicled the story not only with dates, but with what songs were playing on the radio and what the non-NASA headlines were.    Personal judgments abound.  He pulls no punches on Buzz Aldrin and a few other astronauts, resurrects the Apollo 15 \\"scandal,\\" and then runs a one-man campaign to redeem and lionize Alan Shepard, burying the screw-ups of Apollo 14.  (For those who consider Shepard a hero, as I once did, may I suggest Andrew Chaikin's authoritative and well-researched tome [[ASIN:B0018ZRERI A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts]].)  Another thing I found really different about Cernan's memoir:  Wally Schirra is finally vindicated as an unsung hero of the space race.  The author recaps Schirra's brash manner during the Apollo 7 flight as others have, but also points out that Wally had been that way during the previous 21 months (since The Fire), getting in everyone's face with his demands at North American and other contractors.  It made me realize how much Wally Schirra had to do with us (the human race) getting to the moon by the time we did.    Any Apollo aficionado would be remiss without reading this.  (Ditto for Chaikin, and Jim Lovell's [[ASIN:0618619585 Apollo 13]].)  This is an inspiring American success story.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Jason returns with a new voice after a soul enlightening tour including Hawaii and Australia where he dove into spiritual readings and the Hawaiian lifestyle. The lyrics of this new CD largely reflect those experiences in this introspective and personal album. Of the title, Jason says it best on his website:  \\"What I love about mankind is that yes, we sing and we celebrate when we dance and we're foolish and we steal things. It's hard to have a new idea in music, in fashion, the land we walk on. It's all recycled. I think to say we stole it is a lot more fun.\\"<br /><br />Starting out the CD is \\"Make it Mine\\" with a retro 70's sound, lots of horn and lyrics that reflect his new perspective on life. In the same vein lyrically, he bolts out \\"Dynamo of Volition\\" with a lot of energy in classic Mraz style that early Mraz fans will definitely enjoy. In \\"Only Human\\" he is accompanied by his new funk retro sound as he reveals our human vulnerabilities.<br /><br />\\"Lucky\\", with the talented Colbie Caillat making for a very nice match, has a subtle jazzy sound, and a beautiful blend of their voices. If you haven't checked out Colbie yet, you should. Ideal love transforms into something more carnal in the horn-fluttering retro funk song \\"Butterfly\\". The Jason sound we've come to know on previous CDs, this song delivers plays on words and tongue-twisting double-entendres that only Jason can turn.<br /><br />He confesses tenderly his own past in \\"Love for a Child\\", a song about growing up too fast. \\"Details in the Fabric\\" is an emotionally gripping call to hang in there through the tough times. The lyrics of \\"Coyotes\\" belie the story of predatory search for love in NYC. Given the subject, it makes me scratch my head that he has a childrens chorus singing backup but is rescued by its very dynamic sound with his rapping style, operatic touches and at times Sting-like sound.<br /><br />The four songs which I consider to be the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the CD are also on the EP \\"We Sing\\" as versions from different sessions. Those include the upbeat reggae sound of \\"I'm Yours\\", a tune already an online hit; his anthem \\"Live High\\"; the light-hearted pop ballad, \\"If it Kills Me\\" in which is he almost sounds a bit like Paul McCartney; and the melodic and nostalgic story of \\"A Beautiful Mess\\".<br /><br />He is back rapping for \\"Mudhouse/Gypsy MC\\" live on the EP CD \\"We Steal Things\\", along with alternate cuts for \\"Love for a Child\\", \\"Coyotes\\", and \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\".<br /><br />The third EP CD \\"We Steal Things\\" contains excellent alternate cuts for \\"Make It Mine\\", \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Only Human\\", and \\"Dynamo of Volition\\".<br /><br />More like Mr. A-Z than his first CD, \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" largely has a melancholy introspective vibe. I think this CD will actually appeal to an older audience with its mostly mellow retro funk sound and revealing personal lyrics. Kenny Loggins fans will find some common ground there. Mraz is definitely stepping away from his safe pop platform and stepping out in a new direction musically. Here's to clear waters! Regardless of the stylistic changes he incorporates in the new CD, I think all fans will be happy with the \\"We Sing\\" EP CD and highly recommend it by itself with 5 stars.

B0009MAP90|2.0|This album is more of a curiosity than anything else. Every great artist has to start somewhere, and while Dylan hardly distinguishes himself from the rest of the folk-singing pack in his debut, he certainly doesn't embarrass himself either. He's not the \\"Dylan\\" everybody thinks of today, although it wouldn't be all that long till he'd emerge - after he worked through his growing pains on this effort, he would mature as few other artists ever had into an accomplished singer/songwriter with his second album (\\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\"). There are basically no standout performances on \\"Bob Dylan,\\" and had he never  followed it up, this album certainly would've faded into obscurity and been completely forgotten by the time of the British Invasion. That didn't happen, of course, but for all the genius that he'd show on subsequent albums, there are only occasional hints on this album that he'd develop into a legend. The only two original songs are \\"Talkin' New York,\\" which almost can be taken literally since he talks most of the song rather than sings it, and \\"Song to Woody,\\" which never really comes together as a song but at least is interesting. Most tellingly, the only song on this album that made it onto his \\"Biograph\\" career retrospective was \\"Baby, Let me Follow You Down,\\" which is a fine song, well played and sung by Dylan, but was his take on another guy's take on somebody else's song. To put this album into historical context, play it all the way through, then listen to \\"Freewheelin'\\" and then consider that the second album came out just a year after this debut. And then look at those young eyes staring back at you on the cover, which seem to be saying, \\"I'm not going to be singing about Pretty Peggy-O for much longer.\\"
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave's second record 'Out Of Exile' is an instant classic. Released in 2005 on the Interscope label, 'Out Of Exile' is musically better than their debut. Chris Cornell's vocals are outstanding, and Tom Morello's guitars are worth the price of the album alone.    Although many people prefer their self-titled debut over 'Exile,' I am not one of those people. Songs like 'Doesn't Remind Me,' 'Be Yourself' and 'Out Of Exile' are among the band's finest.    I never understood why songs like 'Dandelion' never got played on the radio that much. It's a great alternative song, and traces of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine show throughout the song.    Overall, this is highly recommended to anybody who wants to hear some classic alternative. An extraordinary record that is well worth owning.    Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!

B0011N1WE8|5.0|This was such a fun movie.  The tale is great and the acting is wonderful.  James McAvoy is so cute and sweet.  I really enjoyed the sets, especially Penelope's bedroom, it is full of magic and imagination.  Her wardrobe leaves me drooling as well.  This is an entertaining and fun movie and I've been waiting for it to be released on DVD ever since I saw it in the theater.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|This movie was great. I watch many time, then I began to try drifting on my own car. It didn't work out so well and now I'm in a major law suit with the director and producer of this film.

B00192IOBA|3.0|Having seen Jason Mraz several times live, it's disheartening to hear most of his albums sounding so...produced.  So much horn and extra rhythm  sections...extra jazz guitar parts, etc.  His 4 song EP released months ago (\\"We Sing\\")was the quintessential soul of those songs.  Only 2 people should be on stage, as well as in the recording booth...and that's Mraz and Toca Rivera.<br /><br />\\"Live at Java Joe's,\\" \\"Selection for Friends,\\" and \\"We Sing\\" capture Mraz's vocal range, creativity, and stage presence.  His major releases are overly produced, creating clutter around great songs.  Who knew \\"Did you get my message\\" was such a great song, until you heard the live version on \\"Selection for friends?\\"
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This CD has to be one of the biggest bright spots in music over the last ten years. Why? Because it marks the return of REM to their sound of the late 1980s and early 1990s, a sound that was guitar driven and had an edge. Recent albums had gotten rather overproduced and rather sappy. They were not horrible albums, but they did not sound like REM. REM decides to finally rock again and what they deliver is an album that reminds me very much of Monster.
B000065BPB|3.0|This review comes with the caveat that it is written by an old guy with the usual age related diminished hearing spectrum. Sound seems fine without undue bass boom. The headphones fit my XL size head without discomfort. The quality of construction is abysmal as are the materials. If you handle with some care these should last but if they are subject to any rough handling expect them to come apart rapidly. I use mine only about once a day and they fit nicely on my Lacie hard drive while awaiting use. I say 3 stars because for the price they meet my particular needs but I couldn't recommend them for an active listener.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|...they're at it again...<br /><br />This time with a summer offering for the kids.  Not sure if it's just a Billie Joe Whats-his-name side project, but there's a new band called Foxboro Hot Tubs with a new disc.  Sample the tunes on Amazon, but I don't think the samples do it justice.  This disc wreaks of 60's pop, psychedelia, and garage punk sounds.  Just the ticket to jump-start your summer if you're 40-something, male, & a lover of that kind of stuff.  The songs hold up pretty well on their own without being total copies of the Kinks, Yardbirds, etc.  It could be just the thing to get the kids of today weened off all the junk that they listen to, but more than likely it will just be a small blip on their radar screen....in a better world it would be #1 on the Billboard charts, but sadly, it ain't a better world when the kids skateboard to hip-hop etc., instead of pure sundrenched 60's pop.<br /><br />Fox
0786838655|5.0|Imagine Mount Olympus on the six-hundredth floor of the Empire State Building, the Underworld in Los Angles, and a mysterious camp/training ground for kids with one Olympian parent on Long Island. You will never view the world the same. Percy Jackson is the stereotypical class-troublemaker-kicked-out-of-every-school-he-ever-attended-ADHD-poster-child-with-dyslexia. He is also not supposed to exist; the modern day son of the Greek God Poseidon who swore not to have anymore kids with mortals. Oops. The Lightning Thief starts on his alternative school's (school for kids who are rich and got kicked out of other schools) field trip to a museum. The first chapter is titled \\"I Accidentally Vaporize my Pre-Algebra Teacher\\". Oops again. From there, he has too make his way to Camp Half Blood, and oh yeah, save the world from Krono's (the head titan's) evil clutches. Really, it will sound like a book about normal kids in my opinion. There are rivalries, human statue gardens, mattress stores, killing lessons, and a God-level war that sticks kids in the middle. As odd as this may seem, I find it very easy to relate to. Kids are friends, even though their parents think they shouldn't be. Percy never sees his dad, like so many American kids. Children try to prove themselves to their Olympian parents. Adults have hard times getting along and stick kids in the middle when it isn't fair. I give this book two thumbs up. It takes a historical and humorous plot, and inserts real-life right down the middle. Hint to parents: This book will greatly increase your child's knowledge of Greek mythology.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|I love this CD! I agree with another reviewer, the music reminds me a lot of the cool all-gal garage band The Pandoras. I just found out that they are really Green Day. Very cool.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|One of the best soundtracks to one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Got it that day it came out and still listen to it all the time.  It may be short but the music is flawless.  Most of the songs might even be described as beautiful.  Eddie Vedder is brilliant.
0385338082|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's [[ASIN:0385338082 Can You Keep a Secret?]] blew me away with its wit and humor. There were times when I roared out loud with laughter and there was a time near the end of the book where I wanted to weep. This book surpassed my expectations. After reading the Undomestic Goddess, I was expecting a book that was similarly amusing, but Emma is a much funnier character.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />When we meet Emma Corrigan she totally messes up a \\"slam-dunk\\" business meeting and is headed back to London from Scotland on a flight that gets rather turbulent in more ways than one. In some ways, the turbulent plane ride becomes a metaphor for her life throughout much of the book after meeting a fellow business executive, who turns out to be her firm's founding owner--Jack Harper.<br /><br />Emma spills all of her secrets to this stranger on the flight while others on the flight are praying that they will land safely in London. These secrets range from her hatred of crochet to her attempts to kill a co-worker's plant with orange juice. She thinks nothing much of it at the time because he is a mere stranger on the plane. However, she soon gets back to the office to discover that the man on the plane is none other than Jack Harper, the partial owner of Panther Corporation.<br /><br />The banter between Emma and Jack sets the stage for the ultimate betrayal. Emma runs the gamut of emotions in this book from pleased with herself that she and the CEO have a secret understanding to head-over-heels in love to disappointment, embarrassment, and betrayal.<br /><br />***End Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />This books examines relationships in their many forms: love, romance, friendship, family. Emma learns a lot about her familial relationships and that even the best of friends have secrets from one another. She learns that honesty may be the hardest option in some cases, but it generally is the best road to undertake. Her evolution throughout the novel is fantastic and well-paced.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|I like the Resident Evil series, they're a real guilty lowbrow pleasure and I'll admit to quite liking this the third and weakest of the set. But there are flaws, somebody clearly took the title of the second film to heart \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" and having decided that as the third clearly had to be a post apocalypse movie they headed to the DVD collection in order to rehash all the post apocalyptic movies there. A boy and his dog, Desolation Alley, Return of the Jugger and Mad Max all appear to have covered the ground before. In order to get to this point there's been a hell of a chronological jump that to my mind knackers the continuity. Eight years have passed, the attempts to contain the T-virus failed and then for reasons that make no sense and get no explanation, the world dries up and becomes a zombie infested desert with only a few normal survivors scavenging fuel for their convoys. Alice has separated from the group that rescued her and only two of the others make an appearance. Both wonder around finding the usual selection of psychotic survivors and some genuinely scary crows before their somewhat fortuitous reunion.  At this point they come to the attention of the Umbrella corps mandatory deranged scientist, who's happily mass producing Alice clones in his secret bunker complex and killing them off, supposedly in the search for a cure. Battle commences, Alice wins hurrah !  She and one of her clones now get control of the clone plant and sends threatening holograms to the Umbrella CEO, scene for follow-up now set.   So the scenario is stock post apocalypse desert, no cliché remains unturned and the chronological leap leaves much unexplained. Perhaps the CGI Resident Evil Degeneration will plug some of the gaps. But despite this it's a fun bit of escapism.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The thought of anyone monkeying around with the Beatles catalog should start the warning lights flashing, but the effort of George and Giles Martin (George the Dad was the Beatles' producer) have produced a most interesting re-examination and reformation of some classic works.  The Indian percussion added to the opening of Here Comes the Sun gives it a new perspective, and the mixing of rhythmically and sonically diverse elements (all from Beatle songs to Beatle songs) reawakens one's ears to the innovations as you attempt to identify which elements were combined for new effect.  Weak moments are the cheer-enhanced Wanna Hold Your Hand, and the slowed down Octopus' Garden (using the orchestral arrangement for Good Night) sounds a tad forced.  That said, there are oodles of sonic surprises and meshings that make this a worthwhile investment for hard core Beatle fans as well as the novice.    The concept traces back to an inspiration of George Harrison while watching the Cirque du Soleil, and it carries the blessings of the surviving Fabs and their families.  A potential follow-up would be to releace a Cirque performance synched to the tunes - a cursory vieewing of some of the clips on youTube hold the promise that this could be a terrific multimedia experience with the sight and sound combined for those not going to Vegas any time soon - enjoy!
B0001GMIOE|3.0|I have been in so many situations where I couldn't use my expensive camera because I didn't have an extra battery, do yourself a favor and get one.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I'm not even going to try to compare \\"Sweeney Todd\\", the movie and \\"Sweeney Todd\\" the play. Both are great, with their individual personalities. The play allows us to watch the action; the film makes us a part of the action. The photography often races through the dark streets of London, and we find ourselves trying to keep up with it. Then we're suddenly back in the story, in an almost voyeuristic way. We like Sweeney Todd because we can empathize with why he became the \\"Demom\\". We realize we are all capable of commiting bad things. Thankfully, most of us don't follow through. We know the difference between right and wrong. We know Mr. Todd has descended into madness, and it is his acceptance and understanding of his condition that make him respectable. Johnny Depp delivers yet another perfect performance as Sweeney. Helena Bohnam Carter is wonderful as Mrs. Lovett. She allows us to watch as she subtly shifts  personality from a desperate woman guilty of making \\"the worst pies in London\\" to an obsessed, evil accomplice. They become business partners, and soon Mrs. Lovett is happily famous for making the best pies in London. Make no mistake, there is a lot of blood flying in all directions, and that may bother some people. Truthfully, I have seen more blood and gore in those \\"franchise\\" movies. Director Tim Burton mixes up a batch of bright red blood, and along with some great effects he drenches us with Sweeney's vengeance. The flim is beautifully shot in very muted color, which plays well against the artful grayness of old London. The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Alan Rickman as a lecherous, cruel man of power. The story unfolds, as it must, as a gothic opera, with a great soundtrack. (Don't buy the \\"highlights\\" CD; get the full soundtrack with an 80 page book of the full libretto). Perhaps Burton's best decision was to cast the leads with \\"non-singers\\". Johnny Depp is actually an excellent non-singer, his every word making its point. Helena Bonham Carter is definitely a true non-singer, and yet she manages to capture the desparation, obsession, fear, pathos and love her character demands. A lot of people don't like \\"musicals\\", but this film would have been mundane and most likely a flop, if the script was spoken. Why? Because it would have shoved us back to the balcony, only allowing us to watch rather than participate. There are some darkly hilarious scenes, and the lyrics are perhaps some of Sondheim's best. I especially thought \\"A Little Priest\\" was grotesquely funny. If you have not yet seen it, give it a try. It's a gem that was poorly treated by the Academy. Johnny Depp deserved that Oscar. His performance was stunning, reminding me that the last time I was so impressed was the year Meryl Streep won for \\"Sophie's Choice\\". One afterthought: you will probably never feel the same about using a razor when you shave.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I owned this DVD for 8-10 months before i unwrapped and watched it--I didn'T like \\"Spirited Away\\" (you tell me why; I don't know). But I loved \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" from the same studio, and \\"Whiper of the Heart,\\" which I think Miyazaki had a hand in.<br />Miyazaki takes the complexities of a simple problem (must the need for mechanization and what we make of natual resourses ruin nature?) and weaves a story of the most glorious creatures one has ever seen, imagined or not had the imagination to imagine. And although there is a hero and a heroine, nobody else is all good or all bad. I loved all the characetrs, from the girls rescued from a brothel to the (GULP!) Night Walker. Move over, Lawrence Olivier in Henry V (sorry; I was just thinking of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen).<br /><br />There is a problem wih my DVD player, and I couldn't get the original soundtrack. I had no problems with the excellent actors in the English version (I think the Japanese are second only to Bergman in dubbing), but having read the reviews, I will watch it in japanese tomorrow at my friend's house.<br /><br />LATER: The ENGLISH (dubbed) version is much better---because, first, the actors are all adequate to the task, but second, and more important, there is only so much subtitle you can fit on the screen at one time, and the subtitles to the Japanese version tend to be minimalist. The Japanese language is spoken rather quickly, and while the English-speaking actors could keep up, the subtitle-writers could not (besides, they have to take the reading speed of the audience into consideration as well).. (There have been movies where I have learned things from the subtitles that I hadn't even known were in the movies---this is NOT one of them!)You will learn a lot more of what's going on in the speech and thought of the characters--unless you know Japanese--if you watch the English language version.

B00127RAJY|5.0|If you're like me, it is hard to get motivated after a long day.  I figure if I can't do a 20 minute workout then I might as well give up on getting fit.  This workout rocks! You truly get a quality workout in 20 minutes.
B00136Q6D0|5.0|(I'm dating myself but) I remember clearly the day I first heard this music, playing in the Papyrus bookstore on Broadway between 114th and 115th St. (?).  About 11:00 in the morning.  The album had just been released.  I recognized it and came to love it immediately....music so unlike anything else I had heard and so directly connected to the pure idea of 'Beauty'.<br /><br />The bookstore is long gone.  I've heard this album a hundred times since, and there is no point in pretending the fresh, wonderful shock of discovery hasn't disappeared.  But it is still undeniably beautiful.  And listening now it is amazing to recognizing how many hundreds of records made since have referenced it.<br /><br />Anyone who hasn't heard this is missing out.<br /><br />(god bless miles)

0743297334|2.0|I have actually heard more than one person say that \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is their favorite book.  I have no idea why they would say that.  Maybe I just didn't \\"get it.\\"    The novel revolves around five English-speaking expatriates who spend their time drinking and carousing their way from Paris to a festival in Pamplona.  The four men in the group are all in love with the one woman to some extent.  And the woman has affection of some type for each of the men.    There is some humorous drunken dialogue from time to time.  There are some good descriptions of bullfighting and trout fishing .  Beyond that, there is not much to recommend \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"    There is very little story to be told.  The book reads like the travel journal of a lovesick person that has been translated from another language into English.  Perhaps it just hasn't aged as well as some of Hemingway's other work.  \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was lost on me.
0380730405|4.0|I read this book in the 8th grade and haven't forgotten it.  Since then I've brushed up on it a couple of times.  Rebecca, the late wife of Maxim, is praised and adored by the staff at Maxim's house.  The new wife (whose name we are never given) feels inadequate to fill the \\"wonderful\\" shoes of Rebecca.  Since there are many other reviews that describe what happens, I will touch on why this book is memorable and worth reading.<br /><br />The biggest plus to this book is suspense.  Was Rebecca who others thought she was?  Did Maxim adore her?  Does the new wife have any chance at his heart considering their chaste relationship?  They didn't even sleep in the same room.  It's no wonder that the new wife feels like she'll never match up.  The story picks up halfway through the book when we discover that Rebecca isn't all she pretended to be.  This idea intrigued me, and I was relieved to find that Maxim preferred his new wife and did love her more than Rebecca.  I do agree with the other reviewers who said that another chapter could have been added to the ending.  I would like to know how their marriage was different after the trial and fire.
0307237702|5.0|After having read this book, not being able to put it down, it was a wonderful read.  He's quite enlightening with his hopes and beliefs.  It is about time for some sort of change in the White House, why not vote for a man of his caliber, hopes and inspirations?
0743277708|5.0|I love reading, but I have read very few books over again ever.  Having said that, I have re-read Watership Down countless times.  I've bought this book for most of my friends.  I find it odd and lovely that a book about rabbits can say so much about life and the human condition.
B000EJ9N6Y|4.0|\\"Bande A Part,\\" the second album by Nouvelle Vague, follows the same formula as the first, offering up clever covers of new wave/punk/new romantic oldies from the 1970s and '80s -- some are brilliant reinterpretations, such as their take on Echo & The Bunnymen's \\"Killing Moon\\" (which opens the album) and \\"Dance With Me,\\" from Lords Of The New Church, which are recast as introspective cabaret ballads. There are other surprises, such as a coy music-hall rendition of Billy Idol's \\"Dancing With Myself\\" that actually manages to invest the song with a resonant emotional core, or their spin at U2's \\"In The Name Of Love,\\" a song that's easy to despise if you lived through the early years of MTV and Reagan-era Top 40 radio , but here is a pleasant sort of a lark.  The novelty wears off mid-album, though, and some listeners will be forgiven for thinking this is an idea best taken in moderate doses - in a college radio freeform mix, for example.  All in all, nice, clean fun, with the best songs front-loaded in the first half of the album. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slicpue music reviews)
B00006EXDM|5.0|I got this one as a 13 year old back when it was first released and played it for years until I finally wore out the grooves. When it became available on cd I snapped it up quick.I still think that these early songs are the best stuff they ever did. \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\", \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\", \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Gimme Shelter\\", \\"Street Fightin Man\\"........  I'll still be listening to this stuff when I'm old (well...older) and gray.
0321525655|2.0|Nothing particularly exciting nor revelatory going on here. Some nice layouts and references / quotes but at the end of the day it's still powerpoint - like putting lipstick on a pig!
B000002J09|5.0|A wonderful album from a great band. Great tracks all the way through--you'll get pulled in from beginning to end.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|This album is the perfect thing for Green Day.  Coming off a hugely successful opus (American Idiot), what better direction to go but the past?  Songs have a definite retro vibe, but about half of them are definite old school Green Day-type tunes (just not the heavy punk-like songs).  Songs are very catchy, not a bad one in the bunch.  But at only 32 minutes, this is the shortest CD that I've bought since I bought \\"Beatles For Sale\\" to finish my collection.  Good thing it was only $7.99.    If you go in without the expectations of a valid Green Day follow up, and take this for what it really is...a side project, you will definitely be satisfied.
B000005HFH|4.0|Don't listen to this album after a bad break up! Most of the tracks are about being lonely and heart broken. Great cool jazz sound with Baker's unique singing voice. Although his voice didn't have much of a range and he misses a few notes here and there, it's still a great album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD promises to help you lose 20 lbs in 30 days - and as Jillian says throughout the DVD, this workout is No Joke!  I can't say that it helped me drop 20 lbs, but it did help me lose those Last 10 Pounds before summer (with help from my added cardio training and eating right).  It has three 20-25 minute workouts that get progressively harder, and I consider myself a serious exerciser - lifting weights, running and biking - and this DVD is HARD, but totally worth it.  It's perfect for people who have limited time to exercise, but want to work hard for definite results.  I have already recommended this DVD to all of my friends, but I warn them that it's challenging.  There are 2 girls working out with Jillian and one of them performs the easier, modified exercises, in case you need to tone it down a little.  Be prepared to get fit fast if you follow this DVD religiously and do it 3-5 times a week.  I am SO happy I bought it.  Jillian is the best and she knows how to get you moving with specific exercises to target most people's problem areas.  Thanks to Jillian and this DVD, I AM READY FOR SUMMER!
B00005J6UR|4.0|I have always loved this movie, with it's strange and funny story. Watching it again after lots, and lots of years felt unusually good, and having my kids roaring with laughter (I had been telling them about the movie, and they were really eager to watch it) next to me felt even better. The images were dark, and I tried to fix it, but at the end gave up. Maybe it was just that I didn't know how to adjust properly the TV, and since I had not tried again, well...
0321356683|5.0|If you are not too busy at work  it probably worth stop writing code till you finish reading this book.   Seriously.    BTW Don't be tempted to save and buy a cheaper first edition.   The second edition has some very important changes and new information.
0767836324|4.0|I liked this movie very much when I first watched it, being a grown up and all. Now I wanted my kids to watch it too, and I was right: they loved it! Wonderful, funny, fantastic story, with such great actors! I was hoping it was in spanish for my children, but it didn't have the option. They could understand a few things, but even with myself acting as the translator, it was wonderful for all of us!
B0015FHDRW|5.0|I'm surprised by how good this album is! It's a lot better than I thought it would be. It has a great, raw, garage rock sound to it. My favorite song is Broadway, but all of them are really good. Must-buy for Green Day fans!
0143038095|4.0|In the book \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" written by Amy Tan, there are tons of Chinese cultured explored and different peoples relationships that you get to read through. Amy Tan takes you on a journey through 8 different peoples lives and the stories they told. Each story is a little different from one another.   \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is a very challenging read. Amy Tans writing style is very difficult to follow. Each chapter is a different story. If you pay really close attention to each story and kind of take notes they all come together in the end. It is a really good read but challenging. If you have a hard time following book this may not be a good read for you or you can just take notes to follow along.    Throughout the book you get to learn a little bit about the Chinese culture. For example in one of the chapters a character is getting married and it is an arranged marriage, the girl does not want to marry this man. Unfortunately the mother of the groom had told the bride that if the candle that is lit on both sides that represents if there marriage will last, if one of the sides blow out throughout the day of the marriage they will not last together. That is a myth that is told in Chinese culture. While I was reading this book I was sort of comparing and contrasting between American culture and Chinese culture and how much they are different. In this book Chinese mothers and American mothers all want the same thing in their daughters. They all want them to grow up and be successful. In China it is a honor to take after your mother as you grow up. I feel the bad thing in Chinese culture is they have arranged marriages, I don't agree with them. I feel that everyone should get to choose the one they love and want to spend the rest of their life with and not have someone in their family pick for you. If you end up not loving them and you are stuck with them for the rest of your life, you will not live a happy life that you would have if you got to choose the one you loved and wanted to marry.   Challenging but very good is a good way to describe this book. I recommend this book to people who don't mind having a challenge. It is an excellent read.      Reviewer: Brittany Modreski
0061245097|5.0|Cat Crawfield seems rather invincible. She's a half-vampire, half-human woman who works as a vampire slayer for the government. Four years have passed since the events in the previous book ('Halfway to the Grave') and she has been trying to move her life on after leaving her vampire lover, Crispin Randall, known as Bones although the cause of this name isn't explained in this book. However when Cat discovers that someone is trying to assassinate her she finds herself teaming up with Bones again to try to find out who's trying to kill her. Cat now has her own team of humans who help her in her vampire slaying and she has to overcome their prejudices against the undead as well as her own negative feelings towards Bones's former lovers.<br /><br />There's plenty of action in this book - Cat's an invincible (almost) fighter although the fights have more realism than some as people do actually get injured. She's a lively and interesting character too although she does tend to leap into situations without properly reflecting on them some of the time. Cat's vampire-hating mother has a brief appearance in this book which is amusing but it's mostly about vampire politics, fights and Cat and Bones's relationship, as well as Cat's thirst for vengeance against her father.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue for Bones felt a little awkward - he used English slang but sometimes it didn't quite sound authentic to these English ears. He was also slightly nebulous as a character - I didn't feel I really got to know him in the same way that I learned about the other characters. This issue was perhaps addressed in the previous book in the series, which I haven't read, but it didn't really detract from this story too much.<br /><br />However I loved this book, felt it was well-paced and interesting with some good characters and with well-thought-out vampire lore underpinning the events. It has inspired me to pick up the first in the series and I will certainly look forward to the next offering from this author.<br /><br />Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book © Helen Hancox 2008Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book © Helen Hancox 2008
B000002LUB|4.0|This one grew on me enormously. When I first purchased it; I was very<br />put-off, of course, by the cover which is a cartoon joke; but easily remedied by reversing the insert. I was also put-off initially, by Dio's stylistic vocal change. For the most part, gone are the heroic vibratos; replaced by a cynical, and rather nasal sneer. This is not the case throughout the album, however. Witness the vocal prowess of \\"Too Late\\", where he goes from the sad beauty of a balladeer, and seamlessly adds power to his voice in a truly masterful manner. \\"I\\" is another fine example of his<br />evil pipes.<br /> I never doubted the instrumentation, which is superb. Geezer, especially<br />shines, with thick, flowing lines; and some really fleet-fingered devil-rockin' in a few spots. Vinny and Tony hold up their end of the bargain as well as ever; but to this reviewer, Geezer seems to have a bit<br />more punch and flash than usual.<br /> This is a solid album, by some metallic innovators. But, If you're like me; it may take a few listens to free your preconceptions.  Definitely worth buying.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|[[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />  This is primarily a warning to those who have seen the original studio-cut version of Blade Runner (VHS, TV, or theatrical release):  you may be disappointed by these new two-disk Final Cut or the earlier Dierector's Cut versions of Blade Runner because the running Harrison Ford narration has been removed. Despite that, these are still very good films.<br /><br />  I believe the original studio version of Blade Runner is one of the best science fiction movies ever produced.<br /><br />  However, it appears that the Harrison Ford background narration of the original release is still missing from the DVD versions.  I believe this could have been easily included as an alternate audio feature selection.<br /><br />  I have read that this extra narration was added over the artistic objections of original director and now all the new basic DVD versions are being made as he had first intended.<br /><br />  In my opinion, the original studio version was a much superior film.  The background narration lets us better identify with the secretive main character of this film and understand his strange world to an extent not possible with the natural dialog and visuals of the story.<br /><br />  Again, I do not dis-recommend these revised versions of the film.  But those familiar with the original version may be disappointed by the missing narration -- especially as they may not realize that reviews of expensive four and five-disk sets are also lumped into this same review-stream.  These reviews indicate inclusion of otherwise unobtainable, theatrical-release Blade Runner DVDs in those sets.<br /><br />  When I first bought the similar Director's Cut version, I felt cheated.  That film seemed to be an incomplete pre-release version of the original film that I was expecting.  I bought this Final Cut version because I was misled by comments in this review stream which I had assumed to be limited to the two-disk Final Cut version.<br /><br />  I think the narration does add entertainment value to the film, but it may also sugar-coat the director and author's intended warning of the consequences a polluted world of wall-to-wall people and run-away genetic engineering.<br /><br />  I do agree that the extra green-field, escapist ending of the studio version is not required to make this film work.<br /><br />  Some people have complained that the narration seems dead and unemotional.  I think the tone of that narration was exactly in character for a man called out of retirement to do one more dangerous and dirty job -- tracking down a group of murderous, short-lived biological androids.  If Harrison Ford had no heart for adding this extra narration, then this might be a good example of the principle of method acting.<br /><br />MLBhe narration does add entertainment value to the film, but it may also sugar-coat the director and author's intended warning of the consequences a polluted world of wall-to-wall people and run-away genetic engineering.

With her charm and her powers, she helps the two gain confidence in approaching women and being affirmative and outspoken with bullies, such as big brother Chet, and the post-apocalyptic road warrior from Mad Max. Hilarious and entertaining! Easily in my top 20.
0440241901|5.0|I completely loved this book!  This was the first Sophie Kinsella book that I read, even though my mother kept telling me to read The Undomestic Goddess, which I read as soon as I finished this one.  I read this book in a total of 36 hours from the time I bought it at school to the time I finished it the next day.  It was so funny, and I didn't even mind the fact that it was written in first person.  Anyone who likes Jennifer Crusie will love this book!

0385338724|2.0|I recently discovered Sophie Kinsella's books when I picked up Can You Keep A Secret, which I really liked, from my school bookstore. This book, however, wasn't good at all. I kept asking myself, \\"where is the romance?\\"  I liked Lexie and Jon, but there was almost no relationship there.  Lexie is what my old English professor called an unreliable narrator because we don't get the entire story, just what she knows, which isn't very much.  Jon of course knows everything about her, but she won't talk to him, seeing as she is married to an Adonis, who she likes just not in the way a wife should like her husband. It would have been better if the amnesia angle was completely eliminated, and it kept going the way it had been in the prolouge, which was the best part of the book.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes romance, or even reading.

B000EQH2QK|5.0|Oral Fixation V.2 is smart, creative, thoughtful, new, fresh, inspiring, daring, and breaks from the conventional mainstream pop sound. This album is not your one night stand plastic pop kind of album---it's really beyond entertainment for those who take the time to understand it. If you like dance music and carefree lyrics go to Madonna, Rihanna, Fergie, and yes Britney Spears. However, Shakira is something else--something above them in terms of actual meaning and art. This is directly due to the fact that Shakira is fully responsible for writing her own lyrics.     Therefore, it's not surprising that many don't like Shakira because of her unique and \\"new\\" take on the pop world. Yet, she continues to have millions of loyal fans that continue to support her and continue to show her that there are many out there who have discovered her beauty and this treasure called Oral Fixation V.2    Her lyrics are awesome but they are deep and full of hidden meaning.     1. How do you do? Is the first song in the album. It is a direct attack to the Catholic church. One of Shakira's memorable lines is :You've made mistakes/Well that's OK' cause we all have/But if I forgive yours/Will you forgive mine?     2. Illegal--is the 2nd song of the album. A memorable lyrics is: \\"You don't even know the meaning of the words \\"I'm sorry\\"/You said you would love me until you die/And as far as I kno you're still alive, baby/You don't even know the meaning of the words \\"I'm sorry.\\"/I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart.\\"    3. Hips Don't Lie--I won't even go into this one. Everyone knows about this song.    4. Animal City---the most memorable lyric is \\"With you I feel safe/There's nothing to fear from us/Away from the fangs/The fangs of the world/I may be a coward but you are brave/And nothing seems so dangerous\\"    5. Don't BOther---there are several memorable lines but here my favorite \\"I'm sure she doesn't know/How to touch you like I would/I beat her at that one good/ Don't you think so?/She's almost 6 feet tal/She must think I'm a flea/ I'm really a cat you see/ And it's not my last life at all    6. The Day and the Time--The most memorable lyrics is \\"Well, we know/How empemeral life is/Disillusion takes what illusion gives/What's the use of make believe?/This is the day and the time/ I wanna believe that we may still have a chance/We took a leap in the dark/And I can see now/ How our shawdows have turn to light    7. The Day and the Time---\\"Once upon a time you and I/When we were dreaming easy/Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky/There was nothing we could sell or buy/Cause all we really needed/Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly\\"    8. Hey You---\\"Hey you/Makin' an offer that/No one could ever refuse/Don't play the adamant/Don't be so arrogant/ Can't you see I've fallen for ya?    9. Your Embrace--\\"HOpe it isn't too late/To say 'I love you'/Hope it isn't too late to say/ That without you this place looks like London/It rains every day/Don't you know it, babe/I'm only half a body/Without your embrace\\"    I wanna go on but you get the picture. You will love this album. Just give it a chance.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|\\"Crayons\\", Donna Summer's new CD both meets and far exceeds expectations from her fans with the delivery of this fantastic set.  I've gotten to experience a fantastic evening tonight because of this and I'm thrilled to say there's nothing short of electric in the song selections and nothing short of brilliance in the song writing.  Time, age, life & experience all show up in this multi-themed collection.    STAMP YOUR FEET:  Just sit back & let the anthem work its way into your mind.  You'll be stamping your feet in no time.    MR. MUSIC:  A great uptempo song thanking the placement of music in Donna's life and ours.      CRAYONS (FEATURING ZIGGY MARLEY)  Wow - Love the uptempo swing of this song.  A bright color in the box for sure.    THE QUEEN IS BACK  And deservedly so - this R&B/dance groove proves she's got the goods to deliver the crown.    FAME (THE GAME)  Donna's got her own story woven into this one as well and it is the most rock edged tune on the CD.  Nice guitars; classic Donna vocals    SAND ON MY FEET  A really nice acoustic ballad with guitar, nice verse & chorus - still very much in love with her husband - this song is great for anyone who's in a long term relationship.    DRIVING DOWN BRAZIL  A very nice Brazilian tinged tune that will make you swear you're there.    I'M A FIRE  The closest to Donna'a roots of dance, but very fitting in this collection and a nice mix to hear!  Nice little nuances that are not on the remixes make it perfect for this CD.    SLIDE OVER BACKWARDS  For sure the most surprising track on the CD, this blues rock tune has twinges of Macy Gray in it that are very appealing and it's great to hear Donna express this side of her voice - a funky little tune that you'll not be able to help humming.    SCIENCE OF LOVE  A great dance tune with vocals that remind me of Eiffel 65 in the background - again, very fitting for the album and yet another bright color in the box!    BE MYSELF AGAIN  Be prepared to be surprised at this tune- the ballad that will show you a whole different side of Donna that the mainstream will not be accustomed to - this song literally had me in tears by the end of it.  The lyrics are quite poignant and very personal.    BRING DOWN THE REIGN  A great African sound with chants that reminds me a bit of State of Independence.  A great closer for the album.    Anyone that \\"complains\\" about the various sounds in the CD is not a true follower of Donna's previous work, which (with the exception of \\"Another Place And Time\\") was very prevalent in her packaged CD content.   17 years have given Donna a lot to say and write about and I'm really thrilled to get to hear it.    A fantastic add to your collection if you're a passing fan, a necessary belonging if you're anything more than that, and a completely new updated chapter in the book of music that IS  Donna Summer.    Highly recommended.

B0014KD46W|4.0|The latin influenes are still evident in this newest release by Winwood and his band, but the guitar has moved to the foreground on this new collection of songs.  Perhaps influenced by his inclusion at the Crossroads guitar festival last summer, Steve has put the guitar squarely at the center of the two most compelling songs on the album, I'm Not Drowning and Dirty City (a nice dirty guitar sound on the latter).  On Fly the band brings together Brazilain and Celtic influences.  Raging Sea is a funky bass driven ditty and Hungry Man is an African influenced aong with a skittering guitar reminiscent of Paul Simon's Rythm of the Saints recordings.  Nine Lives is Steve's ninth album and contains nine songs, hence the name.  For his fans a satisfying new album and just as improtant, a concert tour.  With the attention the forthcoming album genrated Steve has played three amazing dates at Madison Square Garden with Eric Clapton (we can only hope that a DVD of these performances will be available in the future) and now a summer and fall tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

0307387151|5.0|When it comes to Atonement, I'm arriving late to the party.  I have been aware of the novel almost since it was first published and I know of the major motion picture produced from its story but, for various reasons, it has taken me several years to get around to reading it.<br /><br />Ian McEwan has written a complicated, multi-layered book that is simply beautiful when considered as a whole.  It is a coming-of-age novel, a crime novel, a love story, a war novel, a mystery and an author's reflections on the art of fiction writing, all rolled into one.  The book is structured in three distinctive sections, each with a very different story to tell, and an epilogue that flashes forward more than 50 years.<br /><br />Part One, set in 1935, introduces thirteen-year old Briony Tallis, an aspiring novelist even at that age, who has a vivid imagination but a limited understanding of the motivations and emotions of the adults around her.  Her imagination takes over when from a distance she witnesses a scene between her older sister, Cecelia, and the charwoman's son, Robbie, at the fountain in front of the family home.  Imagining that Robbie has forced her sister to strip to her underwear and immerse herself in the fountain, Briony is filled with conflicting emotions.  As the day goes on, she becomes more and more certain that Robbie is a danger to her sister and is so convinced that he is evil that her imagination leads her to identify him as responsible for a sexual assault that occurs that night.<br /><br />Part Two picks up the story some five years later in France where Robbie, who has been freed from prison to join the fight against Hitler, is part of a British army retreating to Dunkirk in hopes of being evacuated to England in time to fight another day.  Painfully carrying a piece of shrapnel in his side, he realizes that he is responsible for his own survival and slowly works his way to the coast with two others.  But by the time he gets there to experience the chaos and further slaughter of the Dunkirk beaches his wound is causing him serious complications.<br /><br />Part Three focuses on the now eighteen-year old Briony who has moved to London to study nursing at exactly the point at which her training hospital is overrun by casualties from the Dunkirk slaughter.  Her experiences mature her in more ways than one and she longs to somehow undo the wrong she committed against Robbie and Cecelia who has been estranged from the family ever since Robbie's imprisonment as a convicted rapist.<br /><br />Finally, there is the epilogue set in 1999 in which Briony, now a respected elderly novelist joins family to celebrate her seventy-seventh birthday, a section of the book in which McEwan has stashed one final surprise for his readers.  This is an ending that readers will likely react to differently, some in surprise, some in admiration, and others in frustration and even a little anger.<br /><br />Atonement paints a vivid picture of pre-war England and the days immediately after the British army collapse in France caused most Londoners to expect German bombers and troops to appear at any time.  It explores the emotions of both those seeking to atone for transgressions against others and those who suffered those transgressions and find it hard to forgive or forget them.  It studies the \\"truths\\" of fiction and what writers and their readers should expect from each other.<br /><br />I may have gotten there late but this is one party I'm happy I didn't miss.r of the Dunkirk beaches his wound is causing him serious complications.

0785125965|1.0|For the most part I'm not a fan of the Hulk, but I do enjoy him as a story element. So even though I don't like the character I like seeing characters I do like deal with him. Since the Hulk is like a force of nature in the form of a man it can make for an interesting read given the right setting. But I was hugely disappointed with World War Hulk.<br /><br />-POSSIBLE SPOILER- The book should have been titled \\"Hulk Beats Up the Marvel Universe\\" cause thats pretty much what the thing is. Theres very little actual \\"war\\" in this, no back and forth, just a basically invincible Hulk beating on everyone and insisting that they deserve it, despite his main reason for the war is over a misunderstanding, meaning that he is actually wrong in the end.<br /><br />The Book also fails to really touch on the the other side of the \\"war\\" in that the characters who sent Hulk away may have been justified in doing so, regardless of the outcome.<br /><br />So in the end it just felt like the whole story failed to deliver on the very premise. But if you like seeing the Hulk smash stuff then I'm sure this is the book for you.<br /><br />If you're like me then I'd recommend Ultimates vol. 1 and vol. 2 some awesome moments with the hulk in those books.
0375507256|5.0|I finished this remarkable novel at the start of a long plane flight.<br /><br />Then I turned from the last page of CLOUD ATLAS back to its first.<br /><br />I don't usually re-read novels, but this book is that jaw-droppingly good. It certainly qualifies as the best book I've read since Chabon's [[ASIN:0007149832 The Yiddish Policemen's Union]]. As this Amazon page contains analysis and plot synopsis aplenty on it, I'll simply add that this is the rare novel that should have won both literature's Man Booker prize and science fiction's Hugo award.<br /><br />Wowsers.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I love, love this film. I have to say that it is better than the actual play. I saw the play in NYC when Joey Fatone was cast as \\"Mark\\" in August 2002. Joey was great. You could tell he really wanted to get into the part. I think he should do more plays. I fell in love with the characters since then.  Rent is such a moving story. Roger and mimi are my two favorites. I only wish I could have gotten to seen Adam pascal on broadway. I love his voice. I think Manely pope was there when I went to see it at the theater. Not too sure. If you have a chance to go to the play in NYC ,I would go. you can truly see how amazing this story is. Rent is closing - last show September  17 th  2008 !!!  if not the movie is just as good. buy this dvd.
B00005J6T0|5.0|The Eva Peron voice,  although hailed,  sucks compared to the vocals on this LP.  Madonna's vocals are pure and perfect,  wrapped in the wonderful melodies. Pat and Stephen are in great form here too,  add \\"Spotlight\\" and you've a perfect pop album for all the time capsules.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|My girl is back in town and running wild.  CRAYONS is awesome; I currently have two copies and plan to buy more for gifts.  Donna is definately going to rake up atleast five grammies next year. See you in Atlantic City in July 08.  The QUEEN is back in town!  Go Donna Go!!!
B00000DGUG|4.0|The infatuation comes from the semi-melodies located here,  and within this album.  Nothing is supposed,  perhaps a single junk,  or junkie as Alanis would have it.  This pill is not only jagged,  it is bitter and has far more serious side effects.  It is like the proverbial apple,  tempting and alluring.  Go ahead,  bite it,  when you awake in a deathly grave you're happier for it.
1932907009|5.0|i have just finished chapter one and absolutely LOVE this book.  it is by far the best screenwriting book i've ever read.    it's funny and charming and very smart.  i really feel like i can salvage what i'm working on by applying things learned in this book    a MUST READ.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The beauty of her lips,  the sound that emits from them will encapsulate your mind.  These tracks are well written and produced.  Not a pinch of filler.  One of the best full-length albums I've heard in a LOOOOONG time. Thank you Donna and your collaborators.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I enjoy listening to the music of the Beatles and welcome remakes of their music. I have been listening to the soundtrack from this movie in my car ever since I got it in the mail (some 4 months ago). Not only is the music wonderful, but the film is very well done. It tells a story based on the Beatles' songs, excellent choreography too.
B000002MY3|5.0|This album is like an enema:  The pain is torture but the result is cathartic and sould relieving.  The pain of the dental extraction:  The buccal injection leads to the cracked pull from the jaw.  After the anesthetic runs through you,  you're left with an empty pocket of blood and healing with no pain.  Perfect album.
1401216676|5.0|Very well written story that gives a little bit of a glimpse inside the mind of the Joker.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I thought it could not get any better than season 1 and 2, but it proved me wrong and delivered. I cannot wait and am buying it the second it is out! For those simply investigating Supernatural, just watch the first episode and I guarantee you will be hooked!
B00004S5Z3|5.0|Man, I was recommended this CD by a friend, and all I can say is Outstanding! I have never heard a prog group so moving and compelling as Transatlantic. Every song on this CD is just pure magic. This also got me into The Flower Kings as Stolt is a genius and composing guitar work that just is refreshing in the music industry. Portnoy is always amazing and is the best drummer from the US bar-none. It's the best of everything in prog music, no one is telling a lie when they dub these folks a super group.
B00001OH7U|5.0|`Station to Station' was yet another transitional album for Bowie in that it bridged the soul/funk of `Young Americans' with the Euro artiness of the `Berlin Period' that closed the decade. While the making of the album may have been hectic and even painful for David, there is no denying that even in his most trying times, the man could produce a work of genius. While `Young Americans' went flat footed on the dance floor, `Station is a triumph, the best since `Aladdin Sane'. Favorites include the haunting confessional \\"Word on a Wing\\", a beautiful and quite spiritual song. The title track is a two part epic that never seems as long as its ten minute running time....the return of the Thin White Duke. \\"Station\\" the song was seen as a direct ancestor to the Euro-rock of many late seventies - early eighties post-punk bands while \\"Golden Years\\" (lead single released the previous year) and \\"TV15\\" brought back the funk, although the latter also had very Euro leanings as well. \\"Stay\\" was funky too with some excellent hard rock guitar courtesy of frequent collaborator Earl Slick.  Through a haze of cocaine in a desolate LA studio, Bowie created another masterwork which has quickly become a favorite, especially from the second half of the `70's....the European cannon is here!

B00005JPS7|5.0|Go see this movie! Robert D. Jr IS Stark,Paltrow is great,and Terrence Howard WILL be War Machine in the sequels(my prediction).<br />Stay after the final credits to see more of the movie! WORTH IT!!!<br />Now I'm waiting for either the extended version or the directors cut on DVD!! :o)
0385338082|5.0|I'm an English major and I've read a lot of stuff -- from classic literature to trashy novels -- and this has been the funniest book I've ever read. I've never read any of the author's Shopaholic series because it sounds a little too girly for me, so I can't compare them. Some parts were a little predictable, but I was laughing from the start. I recommended it to my mother who agreed. Basically, if you're looking for a completely original and intelligent novel, don't open this book, but it serves its purpose as a light and fluffy book you could polish off in a few days purely for entertainment.
B0002F1CO6|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing, if you like Ajreon sound you must have Universal Migrator
B000063V8U|4.0|I'm not a huge TNG fan, but wanted to add this to my collection.  There are lots of good enjoyable episodes, and worth adding to your collection.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|I loved this production. Everyone was wonderful and so fun to watch. Staging and costumes all traditional. All wonderful voices, especially the beautiful Netrebko. It was so sweet to see the response that Villazon got with \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\" and sing it twice. I thought he was going to cry! :) He really made the show with his silliness and great acting. One gripe I have, is that I thought Nucci was too old for his part. But he did very well with it. But everything was fantastic and you definitely would not be disappointed in this production! One thing that I have to mention-- there is a feature on that DVD that I just LOVED and have never seen on an opera DVD before! There is a part where you can actually meet the characters. No I am not talking about a few words and a picture of each character. It is actually all the main characters that are filmed and chat for a few seconds about what their character is about.. while they are in character! How genius and entertaining! I hope to see this more on opera DVD's!
B000QUCNOU|5.0|I highly recommened this movie to everyone.  The movie takes place in three different decades and has three main characters....Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, and Robert Downey Jr.  I loved the acting, directing, plot, and the cinematorophy of this movie.  The only thing that I think will bother some people is the length of this movie...its 2 hrs and 40 mins long.  Fortunately it didnt bother me at all and I was just amazed with the pace of the movie.  Even two hrs into it I didnt have a clue how they would actually end it.  One of the best if not the best movie of 2007.
B0013HA838|4.0|One strength of this Covent Garden production is that it puts equal emphasis on acting, stage movement, and singing (which only works when the latter is of high quality which it is here). Credit goes to David McVicar's directing for successfully combining all these features. He even uses the overture to highlight the class distinctions of the characters, as servants go about doing their work (and comically avoiding their work) in perfect time to the score.<br /><br />Erwin Schrott, as Figaro, has a rich and deep baritone voice that literally booms out, but is flexible enough for the lyric demands of Mozart. He combines this with great acting. In fact, such is his focus on acting that he tends to speak his recitative. It sounds strange to the ear at first, but he has such a larger-than-life charismatic stage presence that, when combined with his superb singing, the speaking simply becomes Schrott's way of making the role of Figaro his own.<br /><br />Miah Persson (Susanna) possesses a beautiful soprano voice, but she's not a natural comedienne and doesn't have a strong stage presence. The latter is only a problem because Susanna is the dramatic link to all the characters (another way of saying that she's really the star of the opera). I thought Persson was not quite up to the task. Mozart gave Susanna only one stand-and-deliver aria: \\"Deh vieni.\\" Persson gives a beautifully nuanced performance of this exquisite song of hope and longing. She deserves the close-up camerawork she's given throughout the aria.<br /><br />This is the second DVD featuring Dorothea Roschmann as The Countess (Salzburg's 2006 being the other). As always, her creamy soprano voice is rich and expressive. In particular, her \\"Porgi, amor\\" is performed with great pathos and is deeply moving.<br /><br />Gerald Finley is excellent as The Count, appropriately brutish and dense at the same time. His baritone voice has deepened and matured since he played Figaro in the Glyndebourne production from 1994. His voice harmonizes beautifully with Roschmann's. Their work together in Act II is a highlight of the production.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent, led by Rinat Shaham who sings Cherubino's two arias with exuberance and the sweetness of youth.<br /><br />The major drawback to this DVD is uneven sound quality. It must have resulted from the placement of the microphones around the stage. There are times in arias and ensemble pieces when voices predominate but then suddenly fade away and all you can hear is the orchestra. It's very frustrating to listen to when this happens.<br /><br />My favorite \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" on DVD remains the Theatre du Chatelet production conducted by John Eliot Gardiner, featuring Byrn Terfel as Figaro and Alison Hagley as Susanna. This is a matter of taste, but I prefer the more lighthearted approach of the Chatelet production, focusing as it does on the farcical nature of the plot (mistaken identities, etc.). This Covent Garden production focuses on the sexual tensions in the plot, resulting to a large extent from the characters' class distinctions. For example, Susanna's and Marcellina's brilliant first act duet, \\"Via resti servita \\" takes on a downright hostile tone in this production. I prefer the hilarious \\"trash talking\\" version in the Chatelet production. (Alison Hagley remains my favorite Susanna on DVD; she also plays the role in the Glyndebourne production from 1994 that features Gerald Finley as Figaro.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this Covent Garden production and understand why many have given five stars to McVicar's more serious interpretation of this great opera.y with Roschmann's.

B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Love the music, love the voices.  My only disappointment was that I didn't realize it was mostly the same as the soundtrack from Once, which I already had.  But now there is one for my car and one for my home, so it's all good.
034537410X|5.0|LaBerge begins where his first book, LUCID DREAMING, left off, by recapping exactly what lucid dreaming is: the mind realizing that it is dreaming while the body remains asleep, producing a far more vivid dreamscape, one that can be controlled with enough practice.    The book is first and foremost a user's guide: how can we access that wonderfully altered state called the lucid dream?  Drawing upon his own research at the Lucidity Institute at Stanford University, as well as techniques drawn from psychology and Tibetan dream yoga, LaBerge has dozens of suggestions for entering the greatest themepark in existence: our dreaming brains.  We dream about one-third of our entire lives, so why not make use of this time to enhance the quality of one's life?    LaBerge provides a great deal of sound psychology behind his explanations and techniques, explaining the basic reasons why all humans dream in the first place.  He acknowledges that lucid dreaming may be used for pure enjoyment if we want experience adventure, pleasure, or romance.  Likewise, he notes that lucid dreaming can also be used to embrace our darker sides (as Jung suggested), turning darker dreams and nightmares into learning experiences to enhance self-knowledge and confidence, ultimately producing personality integration.  Additionally, lucid dreaming may be used to practice for athletic or artistic events of any kind.  There's simply no limit to the applications of \\"waking dreams.\\"    LaBerge goes beyond these applications, however, to more serious considerations, showing that lucid dreaming can have the same type of transformative effect on people as near-death experiences if we surrender our egos and allow the dream to take us where it wants instead of trying to always control it.  It is in these exciting chapters that we see lucid dreaming as a tremendous technique to reach states of higher consciousness without gurus, how-to books, or seminars.  It's all right within our brains.    Some of the techniques are very simple, such as \\"reality checks\\" during the day, when we ask ourselves whether or not we are dreaming.  Others are as easy as autosuggestion or keeping a dream diary to increase dream recall (very important in all techniques).  Other techniques get a bit more involved and can be frustrating (although LaBerge has since manufactured several kinds of dream masks worn at bedtime which detect REM sleep and signal the brain that it is dreaming via tiny blinking lights that do not awaken the dreamer).    Other metaphysical aspects are discussed, such as whether or not the physical body can be healed of disease if the dream body is healed since lucid dreams tap into the brain at a very deep level.  And can we share lucid dreams with others or make contact with other dreamers who are aiming for the same dream traget on any given night?  LaBerge even notes that he has had at least one precognitive lucid dream that probably saved his son's life.    The practice of lucid dreaming has become more popular over the past decade, but this book remains the most reliable source of information on the phenomenon as well as the best place to research ways to enter the lucid dream state.    It's probably the finest, most comprehensive book on dreams that's in print.
0765316889|5.0|Ever since discovering Mr. Sanderson's writing in Elantris, I've looked forward to anything new from him.  Mistborn I and II were both excellent reads....in depth but not so deep as to drown in.  He has a knack for creating his own magics vs. using the same, worn standards that many writers use.  I will be pre-ordering the 3rd book in this installment soon and expect no less than his determined, colorful and gripping writing.  He has quickly become a favorite of mine along with Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, Weiss and Hickman among others.      Pick up this volume (after you read the first, of course) and if you haven't done so, please take a look at Elantris.  I know you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|\\"Crayons\\" is a continuation of Donna Summer's desire to not want to be in a disco box. She sounds fresh and vocally up to par on every track. Someone called her voice unrecognizeable on some tracks, but I disagree. I've been a fan for a looong time and recognize that voice on every track. Summer's vocal approach can cause one to think she's unrecognizeable (ie. The Wanderer), but if you've played Donna Summer as part of your life's musical soundtrack, it's not hard to recognize her voice if you really listen. She sounds like no other and no other sounds like her. She's like an actress approaching a script. If you're stuck in the 70's then you may not like this box of crayons. Donna Summer is all about moving forward and not limiting her music to one genre just because she's a black female artist. As Donna has said in an interview, (paraphrasing), \\"A painter may paint a chair, but that does not mean that he only a still life painter\\". I get your point, Donna. I'm sorry, Queen. I'm sorry, Empress (smile).
B000093FLA|5.0|I love Jason Statham and got this movie and \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" to add to my collection.  While he isn't the star of the movie, he does play an interesting character.  I'm not normally a fan of British films and humor, but I love these films.  You'll watch them over and over again and always find something new.  And you will have to watch them a few times to catch everything.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Isn't it the dumbest thing to judge a movie by its title? Well, that's what I had done with this little jewel of a movie. When I looked at the theater schedules, my eyes just skipped this title for whatever reasons. But I should've known better because the famous \\"never judge a book by its cover\\" proverb has always been around, hasn't it?     I came across this movie while I was channel surfing and was lucky to catch it just as it was starting. I didn't know anything about it, so it really helped that the initial scene shows no other than Bill Murray riding a cab going furiously fast, through the crowded streets of an Indian city.     Bill Murray's character arrives at the train station and then runs along the platform trying to catch the Darjeeling Limited, a train which is just starting to leave. Then, in a choreographed slow motion shot, we see Peter Whitman (Adrien Brody) catching up with Bill, getting ahead of him, and eventually leaving him behind as he catches the train and boards it through the last car. We won't see Bill's character until a brief scene later in the movie; what we see, instead, is a close-up of Peter lifting his sunglasses and triumphantly looking back at a defeated Bill Murray as he gives up trying to catch the train. This is the beginning of the mesmerizing journey of three brothers, Peter, Francis and Jack Whitman, through interior India, while they look for a reason to be together.    The Whitman brothers share two cabins on the Darjeeling Limited which is loosely based on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a legendary train that runs through West Bengal in northeast India. It's been some time since they saw each other and for some reason Peter and Jack have agreed with Francis to take this trip.    As brothers, they have things in common. They like to smoke cigarettes and they share a taste for over the counter drugs and painkillers. They all carry and share an inherited, expensive, Louis Vuitton-like complete luggage set, which is almost a character in itself; and of course, they all share a past of which, luckily, we get to see a glimpse.     They're brothers, but they are also very different. They all wear suits, but when it's time for bed, Francis wears a \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" pajama; Peter wears boxers, a dress shirt and a sleeping mask; and Jack wears the bathrobe he brought from his brief stay with his girlfriend at a luxurious Paris hotel. They sleep in these, but they also fight, pray and confer. Unexpectedly, these outfits tell us much of what these characters have been through.    Owen Wilson is perfect as Francis, the eldest, who spends almost the entire movie with his head wrapped in an odd-looking set of bandages. He recently crashed with his motorcycle and was technically dead for a moment. He is single or perhaps divorced, and takes, or tries to take, the role of leader and organizes the itinerary. He is struggling to be the glue that they need to stay together but goes a little over the top and even orders what Jack and Peter are having for dinner.     Jason Schwartzman is Jack, the youngest, a published writer who has a high maintenance girlfriend. His stories, so he says, are based on \\"fictional\\" characters, but those suspiciously mirror exactly what happens to him, his girlfriend and his family. Jack is the most candid and doesn't hesitate to say to Francis and Peter: \\"I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people\\".    Adrien Brody plays Peter, the soon-to-be dad who likes to wear his father's prescription glasses although these give him a never-ending headache. Perhaps we get to know the least about Peter, but Brody does an excellent job and with his solemn, woebegone expressions he gets Peter to speak a thousand words.    The screenplay by Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman is extraordinary. But the absolute beauty of this screenplay resides not in the things the characters get to say, but rather in the ones left unsaid. It is like a fill in the blanks puzzle that Anderson and company have given us to complete. I bet anyone can come up with some interesting theories on what it is that we don't see in this movie. I sure came with mine. Initially, I was trying to think of the most logical plot, one that made sense. However, when I saw this movie a second, and a third time, I stopped trying to connect the dots, forgot about logic, took pleasure in the outstanding performances and enjoyed every moment of it.     This is a tale that can spread over so many things that I'm still overwhelmed. It is a story about faith and fate; trust, relationships, aspirations and frustrations; desperation and death. Conceivably, above all, it is a story about friendship, family and love. I do not deny that the mood you're in definitely affects the way a movie affects you. But in this case, I am sure it must be repeatedly delightful and engaging, regardless of your mood, to witness these three brothers spend a few days together, do good beyond what they initially intended and successfully complete their spiritual quest.    This is a funny, engaging and very well made movie. The cinematography, by Robert Yeoman, is outstanding. Teaming up again with Anderson, Yeoman beautifully shoots it through stunning Indian locations in a yellowish, somber tone, mixes it with some slow motion and every now and then shifts to bright blues, reds and greens. The back and forth through the train cabins and the close-ups of the Whitman brothers give this movie a peculiar and unforgettable feel.     Acting, casting, editing, art direction, production design and specially the music and songs, are all exactly what this film needs. Supporting cast is also vital. Like Bill Murray, Anjelica Houston joins Wes Anderson again, and delivers a solid, key performance. Also, after appearing alongside Jason Schwartzman in \\"Hotel Chevalier\\", the 13 minute prelude to the Darjeeling Limited, Natalie Portman can be seen briefly as Jack's girlfriend.     I've always thought that having just up to four stars to rate a movie is like trying to write your full name with just four letters. In this case, \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" gets my highest rating because I could not think of a single flaw in it, nor any way this movie could be better, and most of all, because I really enjoyed it.    \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" might become a \\"cult\\" film. Wes Anderson has another couple of \\"cult\\" movies to his writing and directing credits: The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. I've also skipped those in the past. For sure that, soon, will be corrected. And please, never, ever, judge a movie by its title, poster or trailer!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you are a fan of the musical based on the classic story of the Phantom of the Opera, then you will like this film.  It adds only slightly to the play, but it is a nice addition to your collection if you are a fan of musicals or the Phantom of the Opera.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|If there is a singing goddess it is Loreena McKinnett and Nights from the Alhambra is proof.  The only problem with her music is that it seems to reverberate in your mind long after each performance.  Her vocals are unforgettable and the accompaniment magical with a wide array of unique instruments rarely heard in any venue.  In addition to the sheer joy of lsitening to her performance, the lyrics provide a veritable history lesson about the mysterious Celts.  As a testimony to her skill as a singer/musician, I'm not sure Ms. McKinnett is capable of a poor performance.  She is both an artist and professional and obviously committed to excellence.
B000001EHS|5.0|I love this collection of Def Leppard's greatest hits!  It has all the songs you could want in one convenient place.  If you grew up listening to their music, this is a must have.
B00005NX0L|5.0|First of all, let me tell you how thrilled I am by this DVD - it has amazing musical moment with, for instance, Thelonious Monk, Anita O'Day, Mahalia Jackson and Louis Armstrong shining very brightly (although, yes, the Monk number is marred by some mood shots and other interventions...), Satchmo and Teagarden crooning and scatting magnificently... Actually, I don't think I've seen a more beautiful footage of Armstrong's performance; he was still on the top in the 50s and Bert Stern portraits him beautifully, with some fortunatelly stylized stage lighting.<br /><br />And it goes beyond music; check out the glamour of O'Day's attire, the moment very spirited Dinah Washington grabs the battons and joins Terry Gibbs on the vibes, the look on great Jo Jones' face while he supports Chuck Berry or, for that matter, the bizarre clarinet spot on that number - someone's review said it's Peanuts Hacko (who is too caucasian, as you can see on Armstrong's numbers on some other DVD's), others mention Rudy Rutheford - I don't know how he looked like (I do know he played in Count Basie orchestra back in 40s or something like that, so I guess he might be African American)...<br /><br />I would agree with those who say that cool jazz numbers don't fare here as well as the traditional jazz, blues, gospel, mainstream and some modern ( Thelonious Monk!) numbers, even with the annoying break in the middle of the Sonny Stitt-Sal Salvador performance.<br /><br />The breaks in the performance grow rarer as the film reaches the end, so there is place for true climax and musical as well as cinemathic catharsis in the end. But, from strictly cinematic point of view, I must add that there are some really fine shots; even the disinterested lady eating ice-cream looks interesting - it probably is a picture of the festival culture before the 50s, as is the attempt to connect it with the entertainment and leisure industry in general....<br /><br />All in all, this is a unique jazz experience (and an interesting although not perfect film), recommended (or, should I say indispensable) to all serious jazz fans and interested beginners.ect film), recommended (or, should I say indispensable) to all serious jazz fans and interested beginners.
0694003611|5.0|It is a classic bedtime story book. It is short and simple, yet very young kids like it. Reading it to my toddler daughter is like reading a poem. I started on this book when my daughter was almost 1 year old. It was a bit late, she should have started on it earlier. She loves it. My daughter always sits on my lap when I read the book. She would turn her head around to smile at me everytime I read through a particular part of the story. My daughter is now 15 months, everytime when I pick up this book and starts to read to her, she would start to suck her thumb and know that it is time to sleep. At this moment, she likes this book the most among other story books.
075640407X|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  The stuff that's good is excellent, and the stuff that's not is merely flat.    Admittedly I don't read much high fantasy, because I think nearly all of it is crap.  Now we all have our own guilty pleasures of cliched genre fiction and if you're into fantasy you'll be more forgiving than I.  There is some outstanding world building here, and a few three dimensional characters.  The plot in the large is well developed, even if many of the scenes are quite predictable once set up.  So in general, it was a very pleasant read.    As to the length -- I like long books and I can think of a half dozen novels of 600+ pages that I wished were longer.  That said this book needed editing.  Neither the plot, the writing or the characters were strong enough to make this compelling for 600+ pages.  This is no crime of the author.  One expects every author to love his own voice.    One final item, and it's what keeps me from reading more fantasy.  The proper nouns suck. E'lir Kvothe, Vintish, Yllish, Edema Ruh.  OMG stop already!  The names don't sound 'different' they sound hackneyed.  J.R.R. Tolkien, Ursula LeGuin and Fritz Leiber sucked at making up proper nouns.  Don't use them as examples.  Instead think Charles Dickens, Mervyn Peake, China Mieville and even J.K. Rowling.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I don't know why this book has gotten such a bad wrap.   Every chapter is pretty entertaining and I now feel like  I have a better understanding of where a lot of their songs  came from.   Anthony Kiedis is an extraordinary human being with some serious flaws.   All heart.     This book is a must read for any RHCP fan.
B0018CWEZ8|2.0|With the writers strike most TV shows were drastically reduced in the number of episodes produced. I don't think that these affected seasons should be the same price as full completed seasons, it just feels like your getting ripped off.
B00151G08Y|4.0|This is definitely different from Hold Your Colour, but it's still enjoyable. Where the previous one was more drum and bass focused, this album has more rock and vocal to it. During the first few minutes of \\"Showdown,\\" I was wondering if this was even the pendulum that I was thinking about (I listened to it on Rhapsody and wasn't sure if it was the right artist) but then the basslines started to pick up and I knew it was them.<br /><br />In my opinion, the rock gives each song a little more meaning to it while at the same time giving each song an \\"epic\\" feel as it transitions from rock to drum and bass. The interesting thing about this album, as typical of Pendulum, is that each song is different and non-repetitive, making each song worth listening to unlike most mainstream drum and bass.<br /><br />The only song I didn't like was \\"The Other Side.\\" It had some unique beats to it, but the electronic voices throughout the song kind of drew away from the power of the song, and over all was just \\"weird.\\"<br /><br />A few reviews state that songs like mutiny, 9,000 Miles, and The Tempest are slow and never really pick up. I found 9,000 miles to definitely pick up with powerful bass and neat drums throughout the song. Mutiny has a different feel to it, kind of a jazzy down tempo feel, but is able to pull it together and make a sweet song. The Tempest, albeit slow as mentioned, has a lot of feeling behind it and is \\"epic\\" in its own way. This song features some foreign sounds along with a more rock sound, but listening to it gives the impression of being caught in a rain storm. I believe it makes for a very strong, proper ending to an album which is so high strung and powerful.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer's first album in 17 years is a dazzling display of positive, intelligent songwriting coupled with stellar vocal performances from the disco queen herself.  Although this album will not make you forget BAD GIRLS, CRAYONS is still head and shoulders above the rest of the pop/r&b albums that are out there today.  Intelligent lyrics and intoxicating melodies on such songs as the Brenda Russell-like \\"Drivin' Down Brazil\\", the bouncy reggae title track, the IPOD tribute \\"Mr. Music\\", and the sassy hip-hop lite \\"The Queen Is Back\\" make this album a special one indeed.<br /><br />The best cuts here are the inspirational stomper \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" and the sexy Latin-oriented \\"I'm A Fire\\", a disco stormer that beats Gloria Estefan at her own game.  Not to be overlooked are the pretty \\"Sand On My Feet\\" and the thought-provoking \\"Be Myself Again\\", which can be thought of as Ms. Summer's version of the 1982 Charlene hit \\"I've Never Been To Me\\" with better lyrics.  However, the biggest surprise vocally is the New Orleans swamp-flavored \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" which reminds me of Tina Turner's \\"Nutbush City Limits\\".<br /><br />Ms. Summer should be applauded for coming up with original songs instead of relying on samples or recording an album of standards.  Fun songs with substance--Now that's a concept!

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|There are a couple of other reviewers who've made it sound as if this movie, and the book, are creating a new idea here.  This is far from the TRUTH!!!<br /><br />The greatest teleportation story ever written was authored by Alfred Bester (still only a book - nowwwww, that would be a movie!!!), and it was called, \\"The Stars my Destination\\".<br /><br />The first teleportation story ever written was a short story called \\"Dangerous Dimension\\" by L. Ron Hubbard authored in the 40's.  Both \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"Stars\\" earn the hallowed mantle of \\"CLASSIC\\", and I will be terribly disappointed if the both of them don't make it to the Silver Screen sometime in the near future.  \\"Stars\\" could actually be made into a trilogy.  It is that good, and I recommend everyone read both books.<br /><br />They are . . . awesomely . . . classic.<br /><br />Ian Shillington N.D.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|YES, we have a NEW Donna Summer album !<br /><br />IF you were expecting a 70's style Disco opus, keep reading, for what Donna delivers here is a 21st century creation, that in many ways uses her landmark Bad Girls album as it's template.  Perhaps some never listened to the Bad Girls album from end to end, but that release containes everything from Disco, to Pop, to Rock,<br />to Country, not to mention an ode to one of her idols Janis Joplin.<br /><br />On Crayons, once again Donna takes us on a musical tour de force with a sound talyor made for todays (all over the map) music scene.  A key factor here is that while many of the tracks don't scream dance material right off the bat, most will hit the clubs via remixes, there that multi-layered.<br /><br />The anthem, Stamp Your Feet, and I'm A Fire are the most dance/disco focused songs here, and as proof, I'm A Fire hit number 1 on the Billboard Dance charts, Stamp will be around for a very long time, and is already showing up at pride rallies galore.  Donna's affinity to rock (she strated in a rock band, remember) hasn't been a focus of her albums in a long time, but here two of the tracks rock on, Fame (The Game) and Science of Love.  Slide Over Backwards is probaly the albums greatest \\"out of the box\\" song, yet it's country twang is no stranger to Donna's repitore.<br /><br />Pop is represented here with tracks like, Drivin Down Brazil (after the street in Miami, NOT the country), and Sand In My Feet. A funkier side of Pop meets R & B is found with Mr Music (I call it the i-pod song), and The Queen Is Back (listen for references to On The Radio and Love to Love You) and the tribue to Bob Marley, the title track, which features his son Ziggy.<br /><br />For those of you who have been reading my reviews all along, you know that Donna's ballads are my all time favorite, and here we have one of the finest, Be Myself Again. Simple, timeless, beautiful.<br /><br />The title Crayons, fits this CD to a T !!<br /><br />Ken
0393327655|3.0|If you knew nothing about either Christianity or modern Judaism you might be susceptible to the glib argument in this book.  It is only because most Jews and Christians have not read the Old Testament that is the foundation of their faith, says Harris, that they are able to continue to believe in sanitized versions of God and the law that they learned as children, which are the only versions of the book that could continue to appeal to 21st century moderns.  If we would just read the book, its true awfulness and ridiculousness would become apparent to us.  Harris quotes lengthy sections of Leviticus and Deuteronomy to make us aware of just how horrible the book is.  As to Judaism, Harris  seems unaware of the fact that the tiny, fringe strand of Judaism that believed in the literal word of the Old Testament unmitigated by any rabbinic interpretation - Karaism - has almost entirely died out.  Mainstream Judaism is rabbinic Judaism, dependent much more heavily on the rabbis' evolving oral interpretation of the law than on the literal word of the Bible.  No one practices the religion of Leviticus.  As to Christians, the Old Testament law is essentially irrelevant, having been superseded by the new covenant.   The fact that Harris is way out of his depth not only theologically but morally and historically is made clear in his discussion of anti-Semitism, where he states that it is the \\"truth\\" that Jews \\"have brought their troubles upon themselves\\" because of their \\"unreasonable beliefs,\\" including their \\"refusal to assimilate,\\" their \\"insularity\\" and the \\"professed superiority of their religious culture.\\" Judaism, he says, is \\"intrinsically divisive,\\" as well as \\"ridiculous in its literalism,\\" and \\"at odds with the civilizing insights of modernity.\\"  (pp. 93-94).  These are strange assertions in a book that strongly urges us not to bow the \\"demon of relativism\\" (p. 178) and to impose an objective ethical standard on the beliefs of others.  The true depth of Harris' banality becomes apparent in his breathless description of Eastern religion as the source of all wisdom.  He presents as a \\"rigorously empirical document\\" that \\"cannot\\" be matched by \\"even the contemporary literature on consciousness\\" (p. 217) this 7th century Eastern tome:  \\"when your mind remains in its own condition without constructing anything... only a naked manifest awareness is present... without any duality of clarity and emptiness.  It is not permanent and yet it is not created by anything.  However, it is not a mere nothingness... because it is lucid and present.\\"  Etc., etc.  \\"Rigorously empirical\\"?  Harris' judgment is off on so much in this book that I am not allowing myself to accept his other arguments, no matter how lucidly presented.
0316010669|2.0|This book was extremely well written and the overall premise was quite interesting.    However, the author gets mired down in his own thoughts at times, lacks a cohesive centralized point, and the end result is a bunch of scattered writings that are well-written but unnecessarily verbose and leave you wondering whether you should continue reading.    I forced myself to continue reading this book simply because I enjoyed the author's writing style.  Plus, I thought his individual articles about the possiblities of the mind making rational/irrational decisions was quite fascinating.  In essence, the subject matter was great, but the book really lacked in conveying a centralized meaning.  It did whet my appetite to learn more about this subject, so I suppose that is a good thing.    I give this book 2 stars simply because Gladwell is an excellent writer and his theory, in general, is great.  My recommendation is to skim through the book's chapters and not invest a great deal of time reading (unless you enjoy feeling like you are trapped in a verbose nightmare.)

0099501473|3.0|The protagonist in this book is called shortly Z, because she has an unmentionable name such as Zhuang Xiao Quiao. Probably the author Xiaolu Guo knows pretty well what she has written about, because also her name is not easy to spell. Z is 23 when she came over from Beijing in China to London in the UK. She can't speak any English and she has never been to the West before. Therefor the book starts in pretty dreadful English and every chapter has a specific heading such as in a dictionary. There are very funny scenes in the book for example when Z arrives in London: \\"Sign in front of queue say: ALIEN and NON ALIEN. I am alien, like Hollywood films Alien, I live in another planet, with funny looking and strange language.\\" I found it funny because I nearly had the same thoughts about that word alien when I was pretty young and flying over to England for the first time.     Learning English, Z discovers more and more strange things in the English language, for example the gender definition (Everyone must do his best), which she comments (in her bad English): Always talking about mans, no womans. And Z has problems living in London: The weather is bad, she can't understand much and there is no-one in this country she knows. It doesn't take long and she falls in love with a very complicated guy, who is in his 40ies, who's job it is to deliver goods with a white van, he is trying to be a bit of an artist by making wax sculptures, who is living in Hackney (Greater London) and who used to be homosexuell before this relationship. At the beginning it starts as every relationship in a very happy way: They are both intoxicated by love and make love everywhere and at any time. But slowly the struggle starts. Whereas Z wants to make plans for a future together, he wants to be on his own, depending on no-one. So it comes to a point, while Z leaves London for a few weeks for an Interail tour on Europe. What I really found a shame was, that Z never made any contact with interestingwomen on her journey. It seemed that her life was completely determined by men. I found it a pitty because the protagonist didn't enjoy the Interail journey at all. After coming back to England the struggle starts again...    Nevertheless the book is very sad in the end, but also many things in Europe have been observed with the eyes of a foreigner and therefor it is a very wise and often funny book and it is worth reading it.
B0001FAFL8|4.0|I originally bought this on cassette in the eighties and completely forgot about this band until I recently saw one of their videos on YouTube.  I bought the CD right away because I remembered how much I enjoyed the cassette.  It may at times sound cheesy compared to today's music but nevertheless there are some great 80's tunes on this CD.  I would have given it five stars but the sound quality was not as good as I would've liked when I cranked up the volume in the car.  Oh well, probably better for my aging eardrums anyhow.
B00005JPS7|5.0|While visiting Afghanistan, billionaire arms supplier Tony Stark (Downey) finds his caravan overrun by terrorists and himself captured.  Injured in the kidnapping, he finds a n irremovable piece of shrapnel in his chest.  He must wear an electromagnet to keep it from piercing his heart.  The terrorists want him to replicate his latest and greatest missile for them to use.  Stark has other plans, and is able to fashion a suit of armor that allows him to escape captivity.  Back home, he decides to stop his company from making military weapons, and focus on perfecting his metal suit.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"Spider-Man 2\\".  It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.  The story of the self-made superhero is different and interesting.  Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.  He IS Tony Stark, and he is at least as responsible for the greatness of this film as director Jon Favreau.  Favreau would not be the obvious choice for a film of this nature, but he pulls it off spectacularly.  \\"Iron Man\\" is a great movie for all ages.  I highly recommend it.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|If you're looking for a return to the dark melodies of Felt Mountain, this is the one.  This release isn't as dance oriented as the last two and I consider that a good thing.  I was also surprised at the humor of the lyrics, \\"Clowns\\" especially.  Great!
B00005B9R4|5.0|Released in 1965, \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" is a hybrid of two sides of Bob Dylan, the acoustic and the electric.  Flipping through the liner notes, we see one photo with Bob playing his acoustic guitar and harmonica, another photo with him playing harmonica with a Fender Strat hanging from his shoulder.  Side one of the original LP starts off with the electric, namely \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" a very anti-establishment song, which became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39.  I recall the video, with Dylan holding a stack of que cards, following along with the lyrics of the song.  \\"She Belongs to Me\\" is a slightly weaker track, followed by \\"Maggie's Farm\\", which according to Wikipedia was \\"Dylan's declaration of independence from the protest folk movement\\".  \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is a love song of sorts.  \\"Outlaw Blues\\" is good, it's a song where Dylan expresses some of his dislike of folk music stardom.  Later on, we come to \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\", which starts off acoustic, then Dylan breaks down in laughter, we hear I presume the producer Tom Wilson, then the song starts up again in electric. It's a surreal tune to put it short.  \\"Mr. Tamborine Man\\" is my favorite track, and awesome as it was originally written by Dylan.  \\"Gates of Eden\\" continues where Tambourine Man leaves off, painting a picture of the changes in the 60's.  \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" contains many of Dylans best and most memorable lyrics, for instance \\"He not busy being born is busy dying\\".  The album winds up nicely with \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\".    Many have called this Dylan's finest album.  It's hard to argue, but I add that there are so many that deserve that ranking.  Buy this album knowing your are listening to the birth of folk rock.
B0013UN9DQ|3.0|There doesn't appear to be any difference in mastering between the old release and this one.  The DVD is exactly the same as the old one, too.  I was kind of hoping for some new videos to be included but it's just a re-release.  The only \\"new stuff\\" you'll be getting are the live and unreleased songs on Disc 2.    Apart from all that, it's nice to have if you're a completest.
B00007LTIL|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is one of the definitive Grateful Dead albums, of that there can be no question. Following \\"Workingman's Dead\\", this album continues the direction the band took with blues, country, and folk-styled original songs. To say the album is good is to say that air is essential for life. It's a fantastic milestone in American music. Most of the album will grab you, with tracks like \\"Operator\\" and arguably \\"Candy Man\\" being the weakest. The strongest track on this album in my opinion is \\"Ripple\\", as I understand it, a song that more or less became Jerry Garcia's theme song. It's a deeply spiritual track, and one that I love dearly. You'll almost certainly have heard \\"Friend of the Devil\\", \\"Sugar Magnolia\\", and \\"Truckin'\\" on any good rock radio station, so there should be some familiar territory to cover on this album. Consider this album essential Grateful Dead.
B00005JPS7|5.0|When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting \\"Iron Man,\\" I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.  With Black Sabbath's song of the same name pumping up the viewer, it looked like just another empty action film.  Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.<br /><br />The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.<br /><br />The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.<br /><br />Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|A true classic. One of the only Doors albums you ever need and its one of those classic summer of love 67' albums along with, surealistic pillow, grateful dead, are you experienced, and piper at the gates of dawn etc. The Doors were different the music they were making was heavy and dark and yet poetic all at the same time. They were litterly one of the most creative bands that came out in the 60s and too prove it listen to this whole album and you'll be nodding your head. Some key tracks on here are, Break On Through, Light My Fire, and The End. The song The End is a very apocalyptic song and is really kind of Jim Morrison telling a story or vision of the end of the world extremly great song. Now with the 40th anniversery albums out some songs dont sound the same like, Light My Fire for instance is more faster and isnt as dark and the songs sound more lighter but still this is a great album.<br />5/5 stars

Love, okay i mean its okay to have that as three of your songs but fourteen 2 minute songs is a little too much. But the beats are good and its a good basic rock album but its not as good as albums like revolver or sgt. pepper etc. Its okay<br />3/5 stars

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is one of those really rare albums that has gained widespread success and continues to this day. It has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, and is still selling 5,000-9,000 copies a week or its estimated thats how much this is selling per week. It's also estimated that one in fourteen people under the age of fifty owns or owned a copy of this album. All this proves this album is one of the best ever made.<br /><br />  Recorded from June of 1972-January of 1973 Dark Side Of The Moon is a concept album as explored on such albums as, \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", Freak Out!\\", \\"S.F. Sorrow\\", and \\"Tommy\\". This albums conflict deals with life mainly with such elements as, Time, Greed,Religion, Grief, and Insanity. Really everything Pink Floyd did before this was leading up to Dark Side Of The Moon. Though they did make another really great album before this one, \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\", Dark Side Of The Moon has become way bigger.<br /><br />  Every song on here flows together and is really an epic album to listen too. This monumental album starts off with Speak To Me/ Breathe, which is a Pink Floyd concert staple contains a nice feel to it and is about birth and all that life has to offer, this song then goes straight into \\"On The Run\\", a spacey song with syntheniser effects never heard on albums before that. For three minutes you hear nothing but arcade sound like effects that go straight into, \\"Time\\", dealing with the fact of how everything is rushed or as they sing, \\"Every day seems to get shorter never seem to find the time\\". A classic prog rock song with a really great solo, the song soon goes right into, \\"The Great In The Sky\\", dealing with religion. Really mainly piano and drums with backing vocals a classic songs that goes into another concert staple, \\"Money\\", which mocks greed in the song. Another line in the song also sums this song up,\\"Money get back, i'm alright Jack keep your hands off of my stack\\". Contaning a really cool saxaphone solo a song you cannot miss which then goes into the slow moving song, \\"Us And Them\\", which deals with grief. A great song with great keyboards and piano, one of the best songs on here a great song that soon goes into an almost opposite song, \\"Any Colour You Like\\", which is a space age instrumental song with tons of synthenister space sounding effects that are really amazing to hear, which then goes into the space age song, \\"Brain Damage\\" dealing with insanity. To describe this song can be sort of said in this verse, \\"The lunatics are in the hall, the lunatics are in my hall the paper holds there folded faces to the floor and every day the paper boy brings more\\". A great song that really speaks to you in my opinion its an amazing song and a defining moment in music which soon leads into the final track, \\"Eclipse\\", which is an ending song with lyrics, \\"All that is now, all that is gone, all thats to come and everything under the sun is tun but the sun is eclipsed by the moon\\", once those lyrics are sung this album fades away leaving the listener changed.<br /><br />  If you still wonder why everyone loves this album so much go out and buy it for yourself, and then blast this album and really listen to it trust me it will change your life. Albums like this dont come to often and it is best to listen to them as fast as you can. So if you want one of the best albums ever made in the history of music go out and buy this album now, and once you listen to this album you'll know why this album is included on every single greatest albums list ever made so what are you waiting for buy it instanly if you still dont have it.<br /><br />Thank you.lly cool saxaphone solo a song you cannot miss which then goes into the slow moving song, \\"Us And Them\\", which deals with grief.

They are little more than property to be used and abused and the book gives details that really illustrate what happens there. Everyone should read this book
B000T05R90|5.0|Relesed in August of 1967 this would be the first and last album feautring Syd Barrett before he got too crazed on LSD.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|A Life in Pop details the life of our reluctant 80s Brit-pop duo, the Pet Shop Boys. From their now-infamous chance meeting at a local record store in the early 1980s, the Boys in their infancy managed to survive the stigma of being labeled a \\"one-hit wonder\\" with the likes of their breakout radio hit single \\"West End Girls\\", churning out a chain of hits including their now-groundbreaking \\"It's a Sin\\" and \\"Rent\\". Starting in their respective home towns in the north of England, singer Neil Tennant and enigmatic sidekick Chris Lowe retrace their remarkable 20-year journey in their own words. The film features some previously unseen live performances, rare television appearances (including their first ever from Belgium in 1984), and interviews with famous fans, collaborators and colleagues including Robbie Williams, Brandon Flowers, Tim Rice-Oxley, Jake Shears and Bruce Weber. Featuring 140 minutes of documentary as well as 8 bonus music videos, the disc includes their first ever TV performance and \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This\\" Brit Awards performance with the legendary Dusty Springfield. Overall, A Life in Pop is a fascinating in-depth documentary film chronicling the Pet Shop Boys' enduring and endearing success.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Jefferson Airplane was the first California scene band to get a record deal. There first album was, \\"Jefferson Airplane Takes Off\\", of course that was'nt anything compared to this album. In the summer of 1967 this album was realesed. A truly great album and pretty psychedellic the key tracks on here are, Somebody To Love, and White Rabbit. The song White Rabbit if you've heard is a song that is about drugs since at the time many people at that scene were using drugs. Anyways all in all this a great album<br />5/5 stars
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Daniel Craig delivers surprisingly good interpretation on James Bond.  He is not afraid to create his own brand of Agent 007.  You will not see him impersonate any of the previous takes on the famous spy.  I like his looks.  He is well built bur not pretty; he is handsome in the acquired taste kind of way.  He cares not if his martini is shaken or stirred and we see him vulnerable both physically and emotionally for the first time.  Fighting and running scenes in the movie are frighteningly fast and scary while love scenes more passionate than any of the other Bond movies before.  One part of the film is supposedly set in Montenegro, but I am still confused if the scenes were actually shot in Montenegro, Czech Republic or Italy.  International group of actors brings the right kind of chemistry into this film.  Nothing too heavy and yet, very entertaining.
B000002UAU|5.0|On June 1st 1967 this monumentum album was realesed. It was one of the first psychedelic albums too hit the shelves besides a few others. They spent 129 days recording this album. This album changed the way rock music was and changed the beatles entirely.<br />1. Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, a great opener to the album. It has a good beat too it and is a great song, 5/5 stars<br />2. With A Little Help From My Freinds, another great song and is really upbeat and contains the lyrics, Oh i get high with a little help from my freinds. All in all a great song, 5/5 stars<br />3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, a great psychedellic song containing very cool lyrics(The girl with kalidescope eyes follow her down...) Anyways great song and good organ in it and a nice beat, 5/5 stars<br />4. Getting Better, another good song though its not one of my faviortes on this album but still its a good song and deserves inleast, 4/5 stars<br />5. Fixing A Hole, another great psychedellic song. The guitar riff in this is extremely acid rock how its distorted and the drums all come in and everything. Although it may be short(2:39) it still is a great song, 5/5 stars<br />6. She's Leaving Home, another great song. Unlike some of the other songs on this album this one tells a story about a girl who runs away from home and when you listen too it you actullay see it happening in your head. Extremely good song, 5/5 stars<br />7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!, this is a cool song. It's kind of like carnival music the beat and then the organ in it is carnival style. John Lennon got the idea for the song from and antique poster of a carnival, 5/5 stars<br />8. Within You Or Without You, a great sitar song. George Harrison wrote this song. A very indian styled song and there is a cool sitar solo in it. The lyrics are really indian flavored also and this is a great song, 5/5 stars<br />9. When I'm 64, a great upbeat song but is not psychedelic at all and dosent really fit with this album should of been realesed on an earilier album. Still though its a great song, 5/5 stars<br />10. Lovely Rita, another great song. The beat is really good and the lyrics are really good, 5/5 stars<br />11. Good Morning, Good Morning, another great song and this one has a cool beat to it what else is there too say, 5/5 stars<br />12. Sgt. Peppers(Reprise), cool version of this song, this version is the fast version and the lyrics are nice and simple all in all a great song but only a minute long, 5/5 stars<br />13. A Day In The Life, an extremely great song and the lyrics are really meaningful. Defenent;ay one of the highlight tracks on the whole album and in the end of the song has tons of weird noises, 5/5 stars<br />All in all this album maybe one of the greatest rock albums ever created and if you dont have this CD you need to buy it immediatlyearilier album.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|In a nutshell, the content of the documentary consists of amazing stories, that I have never heard or seen before on any other documentary. The footage is spectacular, consisting of stabilized aerial and ground based photography. This is just an amazing adventure on screen. The only drawback to the Blu-ray version is that it does not contain the \\"video diaries\\" that the DVD version does contain. These diaries were interesting but not a make it or brake it item. The superior visual quality of the Blu-ray far outweighs the loss of the diaries.
B000W74EQC|5.0|This first Harry Potter film is the best to date.  Chris Columbus stayed true to the book and gave us a clean, golden image of Hogwarts and the rest of Harry's new found world of magic.  (From the third film on the image is old, in ruins, dark, dirty and untidy and far from the actual books.  How can the 7th book be filmed when everything and everyone important to the plot and ending has been left out?)  Enjoy this first film and fill your mind with the true image of the books.
B00009V8Z9|3.0|To be honest, I'm not a fan of pop, but every once in a while someone hits it. Gavin has succeeded in recording an album that is completely sellable and it makes for nice background music... However if you are like me and need music to move you, transform you, and break you, there is one song on this album that stands above the rest, \\"Overrated\\". It's the most raw, emotional, volnerable song on the CD and it breaks me the way music should. It refuses to rest in the background and takes over...  The rest of the CD is, well... nice. I'm hoping Gavin can open up a little more in his career, I'm sure if he ever did it would be worth waiting for.
0767827791|5.0|Picnic is one of the best films to come out of mid '50's Hollywood.  Taken from William Inge's play, it is unique in that the entire film takes place in exactly 24 hours.  Yet, by the end, you KNOW each and every character.  William Holden heads a stellar cast.  Excellent summer viewing.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|*Hairspray* is a fun and energetic musical!<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad is a plump teenager who can sing and dance.  Her dream is to land a coveted spot on \\"The Corny Collins Show\\".  With the help of her best friend, Penny, her dad and Seaweed, she does.<br /><br />However, she has to constantly fight and maintain her spot because she does not fit the typical mold of a teenager, figure-wise.  In addition, she's outspoken about segregation between the Whites and Blacks.  The pressure doesn't stop there.  She has to compete with Amber Von Tussle and her mother, the \\"beauty queens\\".<br /><br />Once again, wonderful musical surrounding the issues of racism and segregation.  Self-esteem too.  You'll laugh at John Travolta dragging as Tracy's mother.  You'll also be amazed at his performance.  And, if you'll pay attention, you'll catch a cameo appearance of Ricki Lake.<br /><br />If you're a fan of musicals, you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  It's some transition, totally believable, for Michael C. Hall!  All of the characters are so complex and interesting, and the stories are utterly original.  I watched both seasons in a couple of days each--I just couldn't stop.  I'm looking forward to the next season, and the next, and the next...

B000E0WJIC|5.0|This group is truly gifted and knows how to lay down riffs and melodies. I play guitar and can pretty much relate to a lot of the stuff they play. Its a great album and definitely worth the buy. This album is between metal and mainstream. The hardcore metal fans will most likely be disappointed do to the fact theres no one yelling and barking through out the whole track as to where you cant understand what he's trying to say. This album is what metal should be in terms of singing....incoherent garble just doesn't do a song justice.
0805079831|5.0|This book presents a gripping portrait of what corporations seek to do when they have no restraints upon them. Klein's analysis of corporations and the Iraq war is the best I have seen.  The book is worth buying for this alone.<br /><br />Much of the book is devoted to historical analysis of events over the last few decades in Chile, Argentina, Russia, and the like. I don't have enough background in the recent history of these countries to be certain how much of what Klein describes is accurate.  Her analysis strikes me as plausible enough, though, to be worth serious consideration at the very least.<br /><br />I have a long-standing interest in economics, so that I feel qualified to comment on Klein's approach.  Klein is quite correct that modern mainstream economics has lost its way.  Mainstream economics worships the global free market, in the face of a remarkable lack of evidence that worldwide free markets make ordinary citizens happier or more prosperous.  For more on this, I would suggest Robert Lane's book [[ASIN:0300091060 The Loss of Happiness in Market Democracies]].  Most economic development schemes today assume that the best way to develop an economy is through increasing long-distance export and import.  Unfortunately, basing a local economy on long-distance shipment of goods leaves a country's prosperity completely vulnerable to events occurring thousands of miles away. It also undermines local social cohesion, which is based in large part on local economic interdependence. The doctrine of comparative advantage, which is drummed into every first-year economics student today, takes none of this into account.<br /><br />I have no quarrel with the idea that some government regulations are stupid and destructive.  Some are.  Unfortunately, many of today's politicians and economists are too lazy to do the necessary work to sort out which regulations are good and which bad.  Therefore they want to toss out all government regulation and privatize as many government functions as possible. This idea is more dangerous than many people realize.  Taken to an extreme, it is essentially feudalism.<br /><br />One of Klein's main points is that for any country's economy, rapid change is usually extremely destructive.  This is true even if the changes are valuable and necessary in themselves.  I think Klein is convincing here.<br /><br />Klein does miss some things.  She puts too much emphasis on GDP as a measure of economic prosperity.  The problem with GDP is that it is calculated essentially by counting up what people spend.  GDP ignores population increases, the drawdown of natural resources, and declining quality of life.  GDP is essentially the corporate view of what an economy should be like. Ordinary people should feel free to ignore GDP statistics.<br /><br />Klein is correct that often the people do know better than corporations what they need. Unfortunately, in some cases the people have had the wool pulled over their eyes by corporations for so long that corporate-friendly policies are more popular than they should be. While Klein does not mention this, an example is the long-standing love affair of the American people with the automobile.  Automobiles are great for corporations.  Corporations build cars, parking lots, and highways.  Unfortunately, a transportation system based largely on cars is extremely destructive to American cities, to social and family life, and even to government, which subsidizes cars to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars every year.  Worse, this corporate-friendly transportation system has resulted in making the country utterly dependent on ever-shrinking oil reserves.  For more on this, see James Kunstler's books [[ASIN:0671888250 The Geography of Nowhere: The Rise and Decline of America's Man-Made Landscape]] and [[ASIN:0802142494 The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century]], and Donald Shoup's book[[ASIN:1884829988 The High Cost of Free Parking]].<br /><br />Overall, though, Klein's book should not be missed. Read it even if you don't agree.e Parking]].      Overall, though, Klein's book should not be missed. Read it even if you don't agree.
0792843584|4.0|Slow and plodding, but beautifully shot and well worth watching. Although I prefer more action in a western, I also realize that in reality, the \\"old west\\" consisted of a slow, plodding existence. (The so-called \\"REALITY\\" shows on TV need to take note - There is very little, if any, reality invovlved in those shows).
1857988094|5.0|This novel is up there with Stoker, and in many ways surpasses his classic work. Neville's character is far too believable, the plot unfolds with the character, and together the whole is more than any mere vampire tale -- it is a tale of what makes us human and what it means to survive.<br /><br />Note: Has little if anything to do with the movie by the same name.
B000RZIGYU|4.0|I've not been too pleased with some of John Woo's American films as compared to the HK movies he did formerly but this one is a rare exception.  Free of studio tampering, \\"Face Off\\" is a tour de force for the director and the two lead actors, Travolta & Cage.  I've seen this on Standard def than I rented the HD DVD version and what a difference!!  If you want someone to notice the advantages of Hi-Def over standard, play them this disc! The visuals have a depth of field unequalled to none (maybe Batman Begins perhaps) and the sonics are out of this world to boot!  I am definitely buying a copy of this in HD DVD before they're gone.  I recommend this to owners of HD DVD machines as well.
0307277674|1.0|I found the \\"thrill\\" to be missing from this \\"thriller.\\" I don't understand why people are still raving about it. The characters are not believable, and the plot has inane twists. There are still good novels being written; this just isn't one of them.
0061120073|5.0|Not many books come close to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird on my bookshelf, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has been placed right next to it.   The story may seem bland: a girl grows up in a poverty-stricken section of Brooklyn in the early 1900's, as her mother and father struggle to provide a better life for their family.   Yet, the story does not totally transcend the standard book: the characters are not overly eccentric and the plot is simple. After finishing the book, I could not put my finger on what it was that left such an impression, until I realized it was very demonstration of human nature which left me breathless.   Smith's work offers much insight into the gorgeous complexity that is the human spirit, and the innate ability to acclimate to the life one is thrown into the moment they are born. When boiled down, the essence of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a beautifully written tale of strength in the midst of the eternal turmoil in poverty, heritage and relationships, both deep and superficial.  The book, being semi-autobiographical, is easy to identify with; the themes of poverty, innocence and strength flowing strong throughout the story. But what may seem as urbane and indistinctive actually reveals the matchless feats and adventures conquered in an ordinary life.   The characters of Johnny Nolan and Aunt Sissy bear a kind of comedic tragedy: a loving, alcoholic father who leaves flowers for his daughter a year after he dies, and an \\"over-sexed\\" woman who calls all her lovers \\"John\\". The characters are odd, but also very recognizable in any lifetime or family.   Conclusively, Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the humbling story of ordinary people, doing ordinary things to stay alive, while astonishing readers by how parallel the fictional characters' lives are to their own.

Highly recommended!
B00006JDVV|5.0|Matt and Christian sharing a screen with one really bad azz male dragon, could a movie have anymore testosterone than that.  The story was nicely done, FX nicely executed and the acting no less than great, I was completely satisfied with my decision to give this movie it's \\"day in court\\".  I am purchasing a second copy of this dvd this week because cable chooses to exhaust me with next to impossible to enjoy movies repeating them over and over again and letting great movies like this sit on some shelf collecting dust.  What a Shame!
B000OV170W|5.0|This book is an absolute must-read.  It is compelling, complex, riveting and incredible all at the same time.  Jodi Piccoult tells the tale of two young sisters who are bonded through more than your typical girl stuff like makeup, boys and shopping. One sister is diagnosed with an incurable disease and the other was conceived solely for the purpose to help her sister beat the illness.    This story explores the complexities of issues such as sisterhood, parenthood, medical emancipation, etc. The author does an amazing job of getting the reader to put itself in each of the character's situation.  It forces you to ask questions that you may have never thought of asking yourself.    I know that many people were as disappointed as I was with the ending.  However, this was the only way to make the reader take the focus off a certain situation (Kate's illness) and think of the other things that may or may not happen.    I was crying like a baby throughout this book and had to not read it in public - for fear of looking crazy!  I promise it will not disappoint and I am so glad it was reccommended to me!!  I've since then passed it on to 4 other people and they have all had nothing but great things to say about it.
0340766166|5.0|James Clavell has written many books. This book is my favorite. I picked this book up and couldn't put it down. Clavell has a way with words that make it seem as if you are there in Japan with the characters. Be warned though. This book is intense. Once you start it, you will want to finish it. They made a movie out of this book, but it just wasn't the same.<br />If you have the time, pick up this book and journey to the land and culture of Japan. Learn what it takes to become a Shogun! What a masterpiece.
006135323X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is well written, funny, and easy to understand.  It tells why we make decisions and why crazy decisions are predictable.  It is a humorous psychology book.  It explains ethics and why people think it is o.k. to steal certain items and why they think it is wrong to steal other things.    I really like this author and will buy any books he might write.
0446402389|5.0|To be brief, this is a rugged, educational and also suspensful book that is remarkably well written. It is among the best I have read, at par with Cormac McCarthy.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Not only is this one of THE BEST animated movies, it is also one of the best movies period!  I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's beautifully made and children and adults of all ages will definitely enjoy it.
B00007G207|5.0|There are few people who will know the depths of the loves portrayed in this movie: the complete, early love of an art; the selfless, stern love of a mentor; the young--in some ways unfilled, incomplete--love of an impassioned couple.      Perhaps the film's greatest gift--aside from the wonderful story you will see; the strong emotions which you will feel (tears will drop)--is that you will be shown, almost tangibily, these depths so you may, in your remaining life, attempt to fathom them yourself.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't recomment this series highly enough! Not only did I learn a lot about industrial England and the running of cotton mills, but it also touches on the sad lives of the poor people who had to labour in them. The film also highlights the incredible differences in class structure in English society of that time. The relationship between John Thornton and Margaret Hale smoulders with sexual tension throughout. Richard Armitage plays the role of a lifetime reminiscent of Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy.

034544678X|4.0|I have learned a lot about the way my two pups think. The author explains how to use their thought process to make them modify their behavior and how to get them to accept differant situations.

I would highly recommend this book to any dog owner that would like a better behaved dog.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|If you want to watch a post-apocalyptic film, watch On the Beach.

We like Will Smith a lot, but even he can't save this terminally awful special effects film.
0375424474|5.0|I purchased this book on impulse as it was evident at a glance just how well edited and put together it was.  I learned a great deal and my only complaint is that the cover of the UK hardback was not half as nice as the one featuring the outstanding fossil - Tiktaalik.    This is a vertebrate paleontology book with strong underlying genetic, evolutionary and anatomical themes.  If anything the book kept me asking more questions and it filled in the gaps of the following series -  Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega with the description of the discovery of Tiktaalik.  One more star in the VP pantheon representing a missing link in the ancestry of creatures that culminated in modern vertebrates.  In a lighter vein, the book showed me just how close I was to a shark or a ray or even to a sponge.  Yes, this book made the genetic linkages between organisms and their developmental heritages so perspicacious.    It was easy to read, reasonably well illustrated and above all quite a simple rendition of a complex subject.  In the end, it humbles the reader into acknowledging his/her affinity with the natural world.   That we are not creatures apart from it.    I expect the editors helped erase out back slapping gestures on the heros of this story such as Jarvik, Clack and Romer - that would however, perhaps be another story - as would more information on lungfish, the coelocanth ... this is a very fishy sort of book and now more than ever, I need to know my kinship to them.    In the end a simple phylogenetic framework is indicated and how we arrive at branching trees that describe our ancestry.  I hope this book stimulates more work into conservation and taxonomic research which is very poorly funded.
0452289963|5.0|I am sure you all have experienced a book that came along at the right and changed your life. Well, A New Earth did this for me. I am retiring this year and I honestly feel that it will be the best time of my life.     Due to living the message in this book retirement will be a Renaissance for me. I will be able to live each day in acceptance, enjoyment and at times with enthusiasm. I needed to let go of the past, let go of being a victim and stop worrying about the future. It sounded like an impossible task for me until I read Eckhart's words and asked myself....\\"What is my relationship with the present moment?\\"    What I have learned is that it is my choice, and I chose to live in the Now.    Thanks Echart!
B00005JKGK|5.0|The Joy Luck Club, based on Amy Tan's bestselling novel, is a powerful drama about four Chinese-American families that endures sorrow and painful moments. Ming-Na gives a great performance as June, the daughter of a deceased Chinese immigrant who found out she has twin sisters. Rosalind Chao, Lauren Tom and Tamlyn Tomita were also great in their respective roles. The only part of the film that really got me emotionally, was the young girl drowned her infant son in a flashback. This movie should have won an Oscar for best picture.
B000002UA5|4.0|In 1969, Pink Floyd released this monstrosity.  Half live and half studio, it is really two albums, and it seems to fall into a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of place with their fans.      STUDIO  Each member got half a side for their studio time.  The result is a long instrumental that is more or less hookless, disparate mess of psychedelic noise, an 8-minute drum solo, and two bonafide songs establishing Waters and Gilmour as the songwriters in the band.    LIVE  Here is the real gem.  We get four of their early classics played live, extended and more vibrant than their studio incarnations, and they leave their studio versions far behind in the dust.      Despite its faults, it grows on you if you have an open mind.  If you like self-indulgant avant-garde noise rock, you'll be right at home on the studio disc, and if you like spacey trad jazz, the live disc is fine.    It is a pity that \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" were taken off of this album to make room for the studio parts.  Perhaps since 2009 is the 30th anniversary, Gilmour, Waters, Wright, Mason, and EMI might get together and release a special anniversary edition CD with the two omitted live tracks included.  \\"Embryo\\" live, for those who have only heard the version on \\"Works\\", is simply AMAZING, easily as good as \\"Echoes\\" and \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\".    Highlights: all four of the live songs, \\"Grantchester Meadows\\", \\"Several Species...\\" and \\"The Narrow Way\\".
0575077174|5.0|Publishing's a funny old business. Reynolds' magnum opus, \\"House of Suns\\" has only just come out in hardback in both the UK and the US, but I found a paperback copy at Singapore Airport last Saturday. I hesitated for a moment - this is a big book: did I really want to lug it around the world? - but only for a moment.<br /><br />One of the age old problems in science fiction is that of the speed of light. How can one write a decent space opera, with exotic starships visiting improbable planets, without violating the speed limit? Reynolds decides to stick with relativistic limitations (well, mostly) by playing with the other side of the equation: time. The result is an extraordinary mystery story at galactic scale, in which (for a few travellers) time is measured in thousands, even millions of years.<br /><br />\\"House of Suns\\" is an audacious work. I've enjoyed all of Reynolds' earlier books: even though the stories were more conventional than, say, those of Iain M. Banks, Reynolds confident mastery of his material has been undeniable. In the new book, he takes quite a few risks, and gets away with them. The conclusion... well, my first reaction was confusion, but I found myself realizing how utterly apposite it was.<br /><br />Comparison between writers is invidious, but inevitable. Right now, two of the best science fiction writers are British: Banks and Reynolds. Before \\"House of Suns\\", I would have said that Banks was clearly the greater talent. Now, I'm not so sure. What fun!
0440238609|5.0|Despite all the controversy, I enjoyed these books.  The story was very imaginative and well written.  I wouldn't recommend it for the easily offended or very religious for obvious reasons (***spoiler alert***) because the whole point of the last book seems to be the premise that God is dead or not really what He claims to be.. but religious themes have always been good material for writers.  And there seems to be an emphasis in this series on thinking for one's self and not accepting everything you're told at face value, which is something I think we all would do well to think about in this day and age.    Altogether a very good series!

0143038419|1.0|What started out as quirky, fast paced and funny quickly turned into a painful read for women who have passion and purpose in this world. As a twenty something who is trying to establish herself as a world traveler I found nothing insightful about how Gilbert's experiences shaped her into a strong and independent women- which made me doubt if she really is one. This book is a bulls eye target for women in their mid thirties, trying to define themselves in their post divorce era. Its for women who cannot see beyond themselves and therefore will identify with Gilbert's shallow introspections. If you think that your divorce is the catalyst for a new beginning to be self absorbed while trying to redefine yourself in a Oprah Winfrey feel good way- read this book. Actually contact me and I will send you my copy for FREE.

B0007ZIYM4|1.0|I have heard other passionate renditions of the Seasons before, but I found this one unthoughtful and out-of-control in comparison.  I think that anyone who records something as widely known as the Seasons will have a difficult job standing out.  That's why it's pretty amazing when it happens.  But this recording is indulgent.  It's unique bc it is played without structure -- nothing newer or deeper than that.<br /><br />In the first paragraph of this CD's booklet, Ms. Jansen writes: \\"While trying to be faithful to each score, emotion and passion are very important to me in a performance.  Technique has to be there, of course, but it should never be the main thing.\\" Her paragraph is a good summary of the performance, and it will be a matter of taste.  For me,  I really missed balance, elegance, & nuance in her interpretation. And the technique matters to me because she's a professional with a product that I purchased!<br /><br />It sounds like a clever artist deliberately trying to be different. I would admire that, if the expression went deeper than exaggerated emotions.  It didn't feel genuine to me, and I found myself flipping through the CD booklet with raised eyebrow.  Lots of photos in the same vein as the cover shot: a posey Janine (looking gorgeous obviously) but dangling her Stradivarius like a bauble.  I'm all for gorgeous glamor shots and love cockiness, but the chops need to back it up for bow-down awesomeness; otherwise, it becomes a bit Paris Hilton.  In this one, the phrasing is strange, with emphasis on particular notes rather than the beautiful, overall melody (esp noted in Spring).  IT was chopPY as IF i were speakING like THIS. The tempos lurch from one extreme to the other. The dynamics are in your face, going from one extreme to the other within a space of phrases.  It's not technically clean either -- Winter is a headlong rush & the notes are meshed together.  In a live performance, it would still be awesome bc it would be a one-time deal withJanine on a Strad, but on repeated plays from a CD, it reminds me that she didn't bother to learn/play all the notes (bc she obviously could if she deigned) and believed that a messy, \\"passionate\\" performance would be enough each and every time.  It's disappointing, unthoughtful, and careless from a professional musician.  And done to the beloved Seasons too! Gah!<br /><br />However, this CD is a fun and entertaining listen!  (That's me trying to convince myself and boost up my disappointment - I would love to be as \\"bad\\" as she is in this CD.) The recording quality is excellent and you can really hear the other instruments because it's pared down to a few players.  I listen to it rarely to check if my response is consistent (yup, it is!)  My husband, who doesn't really listen to classical, actually told me that he felt uneasy when I had the CD running, so in a way, Janine Jansen has pushed the envelope (a positive or negative depending on point of view).
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is, simply put, perfection.  If you love the language and wit of Jane Austen, you'll love this movie.  Dialogue after dialogue are literally lifted from the pages of this beloved book and no one says it better than Jane Austen, and I don't believe anyone has acted the roles better than this particular cast.  If you're obsessed with the novel, you'll be obsessed with this adaptation.
0595440096|5.0|Lisa Genova has written a true gem of a book. I heard about it through word-of-mouth, and immediately after reading it I wrote a Staff Pick for it for my independent bookstore. It was also voted in unanimously as a Book Club Selection - I cannot wait for the discussion next week!    Alice Howland's battle with early-onset Alzheimer's is heart-breakingly real. The author compellingly shows the effects on Alice's career, marriage, relationships with her children, and her self-image. It is at its essence a great story with vibrant characters, accessible to anyone, but when you consider the research embedded in the story line, it is particularly fascinating for anyone worried about Alzheimer's or who knows someone suffering from dementia. The unique angle of reading from the point of view of the patient makes a real winner. Still Alice is exceptional - and not a book you can keep to yourself!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Just get it.  It'll be worth every penny you spend on it.  The relationship between the main characters is reminiscent of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".

It was great to HEAR those immortable words once only read, which describe the meeting of Jack and Steven in Molly Harte's drawing room!
0151013837|5.0|[** SPOILER ALERT - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK **] Life of Pi was a fairly engaging story in terms of plot and character, but what made it such a memorable book, for me at least, was its thematic concerns. Is it a \\"story that will make you believe in God,\\" as Pi claims? I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I would recommend it to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of reality and the role of faith in our lives.<br /><br />To me, the entire thrust of the book is the idea that reality is a story, and therefore we can choose our own story (as the author himself puts it). So if life is a story, we have two basic choices: we can limit ourselves only to what we can know for sure - that is, to \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\" - or we can choose \\"the better story.\\" I suppose in Pi's world the \\"better story\\" includes God, but he doesn't say this is the only meaningful possibility. In fact, Pi calls atheists his \\"brothers and sisters of a different faith,\\" because, like Pi, atheists \\"go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap.\\"<br /><br />Pi's point, in my opinion, is that human experience always involves interpretation, that our knowledge is necessarily limited, that both religious belief and atheism require a leap of faith of one kind or another - after all, there's so little we can know for sure. For Pi, then, we shouldn't limit ourselves only to beliefs that can be proven empirically. Instead, we should make choices that bring meaning and richness to our lives; we should exercise faith and strive for ideals (whatever the object of our faith and whatever those ideals might be). Or, as Pi says in taking a shot at agnosticism: \\"To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\"<br /><br />In the end, however, I didn't necessarily read this book as an invitation to believe in God. Instead, I saw it as a mirror held up to the reader, a test to see what kind of worldview the reader holds. That is, as Pi himself says, since \\"it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without the animals?\\" Or, as I took it: Is it my nature to reach for and believe the better but less likely story? Or do I tend to believe the more likely but less lovely story? What view of reality do I generally hold?<br /><br />Another equally important question is this: How did I come by my view of reality? Do I view the world primarily through the lens of reason? Or do I view it through the lens of emotion? For Pi, I think it's safe to say his belief comes by way of emotion. He has, as one reviewer noted, a certain skepticism about reason (in fact, Pi calls it \\"fool's gold for the bright\\"). Pi also has what I would call a subtle but real basis for his belief in God, namely, \\"an intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose.\\" But belief still isn't easy for him. Despite his trusting sense of purpose, Pi acknowledges that \\"Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer.\\" So it's not that a life of faith is easier, in Pi's opinion, it's that for him belief is ultimately more worthwhile.<br /><br />This is not to say, however, that Pi holds a thoroughly postmodern view of God or that he believes as a matter of art rather than in a sincere way. True, Pi suggests that whether you believe his story had a tiger in it is also a reflection of your ability to believe in something higher. And of course it's easy to read Pi's entire story as an attempt to put an acceptable gloss on a horrific experience. Still, there are a number of clues throughout the book that give the reader at least some reason to believe Pi's story did have a tiger in it (for instance, the floating banana and the meerkat bones).<br /><br />As such, Pi's two stories could be seen as an acknowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith, and therefore it's up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest. He's not necessarily saying that the truth is what you make it, he's saying we don't have unadulterated access to the truth: our imagination, personalities, and experiences unavoidably influence the way we interact with the world. But that's not the same as saying whatever we imagine is true. I think Pi, for instance, knows which of his stories is true. It's not Pi but the reader who is left with uncertainty and who therefore has to throw her hands up and say \\"I don't know,\\" or else choose one story or the other. And to me, this isn't too far off from the predicament we all find ourselves in.<br /><br />And that's what makes Life of Pi such a challenge to the reader: Pi's first story is fantastic, wonderful, but hard to believe. Yet there's some evidence that it happened just the way he said it did. And Pi's second story is brutal, terrible, but much easier to accept as true. Yet it's not entirely plausible either, and it leaves no room for the meerkat bones or Pi's \\"trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose.\\" If the reader personally dismisses the tiger story out of hand, I suppose that's another way of saying the reader, by nature, tends to believe the more likely but less lovely story. In the same way, if the reader gets to the story's payoff and still believes there was a tiger in the boat, the reader is probably inclined to believe the more emotionally satisfying story. But it should be born in mind that Pi doesn't definitively state which story was true, something which only he can know for sure. All we can really be sure of, in Pi's universe, is that he was stuck on a lifeboat for a while before making it to shore. So which story do I believe? I struggled with that question for a long time. But after thinking about it for a couple of days, I'll end this review with the final lines from the book: \\"Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr. Patel, and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger.\\"nowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith, and therefore it's up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I fell in love with Mark Wahlberg after seeing this film.  It is the epitomy of a high-level suspenseful action movie.  He was absolutely incredible in this movie.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Released in `64 `Mary Poppins' is without question one of the most beloved movies in Disney's vast vault of wonderful family film classics. I was twelve years old when `Mary Poppins' made its theatrical debut and I must admit that I immediately fell madly in love with Julie Andrews. Obviously I wasn't the only one considering the fact that Julie Andrews won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the magical nanny.<br /><br />This film is what family entertainment is all about; singing, dancing, cute kids, attractive nurturing adults, a zany but lovable character here and there and a heavy dose of enchantment and childish wonder. This is definitely a keeper by all means.

I really cannot think of a single flaw in this production that is worthy of mentioning.

B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Really excellent comeback album for Donna Summer. Very contemporary sounding, with only a couple of mis-steps. What's up with \\"Slide Over Backwards\\"? I'm all for experimentation, but this is just dumbfounding. Why try to sing like Tina Turner when you're Donna Summer? Lyrically, \\"Mr. Music\\" is as trite as anything found on Britney's latest. And the reggaeton of the title song, for me, sounds out of place. That being said, \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", \\"The Queen Is Back\\" and \\"Fame (The Game)\\" will get you up and dancing in no time. Classic Donna. \\"Science Of Love\\" is a good pop song and \\"Sand On My Feet\\" is nice to chill out to. \\"I'm A Fire\\" goes on a bit too long, and \\"Drivin Down Brazil\\" may grow on me in time, as for now I'm not really feeling it. Vocally, Donna sounds as wonderful as she did some 20, 30 years ago. Amazing. No other vocalist can say that. If she hadn't been as flawless as she was on American Idol, I'd say the producers doctored her voice in the studio. Make no mistake, she's back and she IS the Queen!
0452287588|2.0|This book contains no new information; it does, however, express it in a unique fashion.  To anyone who has read self-help, psychology, or spirituality books, this book will likely be disappointing.    Mr. Tolle gets directly to each of his points.  He has no elegance of languance, no nuance, no finesse.  His language is authoritarian and professorial.  He conveys his message that the ego runs our lives and that we can enrich our lives by getting beyond the ego's boundaries in an understandable manner.  However, I found the book's efficiency of language actually to be a distraction from its message.      I would not discourage anyone from reading the book.  The message is important.  I simply prefer to read the message written by a better author.
B000F7OPCC|3.0|1912, a Boy Scout troop is exploring caves.  Two young boys happen upon some men looting.  One of the boys recognizes a cross the leader in a black leather jacket and fedora is holding. It's Coronado's cross.  He realizes this valuable artifact should be in a museum for all to enjoy and vows to stop the poachers from stealing the cross from posterity. He doesn't win--but he gets his enemy's hat and he vows to get the cross.     Thus begins the career of Indiana Jones.     We move forward to 1938. Indy has finally gotten the cross back from his arch nemesis.  He's contacted by a wealthy man who has evidence of the existence of the Holy Grail.      He advises the man he has the wrong Jones.  They should contact his father,     Jones is advised his father went first and is now missing. His principal mission is to find his father--then it becomes to keep the Nazis from getting the Grail.    There's a lot of good things going for this film:    Sean Connery as Jones Sr is a great foil for Harrison Ford. He's Prof Attila, the Medieval Lit prof no student wants, he's also an absent father, and a still-grieving widow after many years.     The Nazis are great enemies, in my opinion, much better than the thugges in \\"Temple of Doom\\" who were just creepy and odious.     Dr. Elsa Schneider is an excellent female counterpart to Indy. She's funnier than Kate Capshaw, smarter and soberer than Karen Allen--plus, she's got a bad side that makes her very interesting.     \\"The Last Crusade\\" was literally supposed to be the last run for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, but I'm glad to see him back in the saddle.  It will be interesting to see if he can play a senior adventurer with as much grace and humor as Sean Connery did.      Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The Queen of Disco has come back as if she never left. Donna Summer's first album of all new material in 17 years kicks off with the pounding \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" showing she still has it. From there she goes right into \\"Mr. Music\\" and the rhythms don't stop. Don't think this is a straight ahead dance album, it's not. The second half of the album takes different directions from the spanish flavored \\"Drivin' Down Brazil\\" to the swampy blues of \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" to the ballad \\"Be Myself Again\\".    I found this album to be a great listen from start to finish and one that you just start over again once it stops. Unlike recent albums by Madonna, Donna Summer isn't trying to recapture the sounds of the 70's, instead she's just taking her sound and updating it. There's no reason why she can't have a huge hit with \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" for instance and attract a whole new generation who know nothing of her past hits.    She's still working hard for the money and \\"Crayons\\" is a great \\"comeback\\".
0595440096|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is one of the most phenomenal books I've read in a long long time. I picked it up while fighting the flu one night and the muscle aches and fever were no match for the emotive power that this novel possesses. Lisa uses a structure to tell this story which makes it absolutely impossible to put down! At one moment, you feel your heart breaking for \\"the fictional\\" Alice and her family, while in the next you find the book has forced you to confront your own mental (and sometimes physical) capabilities - or those of a loved one - in ways that are simultaneously unnerving and oddly empowering.  Lisa's clever interweaving of neuroscience 101 (never again will I trivialize what it takes to eat an ice cream cone) with practical information about the process of diagnosing and treating Alzheimers and its emotional impact on those living with and around the disease, is deeply satisfying. This book left me wanting to hug Alice and her family and never let go. My heart goes out to all those affected by this disease and to Lisa with great thanks for telling a story of such great importance with skillful poignancy and accuracy.
B00169XU8I|2.0|Okay, first off I am a HUGE Madonna fan and it kills me to write a not so wonderful review for \\"Hard Candy\\". I mean it is Madonna so I had to buy it , but after the most flawless CD of her glorious career \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" why did she go in this direction ? I know ... I know Madonna re-invents herself for each new album , but the beats are so flat , un-Madonna like and it just gives you the feeling she really didn't give it her all or even 50% of her all for this album. I mean I know this was her last album on the Warner Brothers label , but come on Madonna you almost made this a Justin Timberlake / Timabaland / Kane West / Pharrel Williams album with you as a guest vocalist. I know Madonna wants to hit the charts hard this time round because even though \\"Confessions\\" was her best album to date it didn't get the radio play it so highly deserved. Madonna may be 50 this year , but her genious in itself will never die out because she rules the dance / pop charts and will until her last day on earth ! Madonna is and always will be the Queen of Pop and she will always be a money maker in the music industry. I mean she does have some fantastic songs on this album like \\"Dance 2Night\\" it is by far my favorite track the next being \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" because it is simply amazing !!!! I also very much like \\"Give It 2 Me\\" , \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\" , but the rest of the album is too flat and really makes one lose interest quickly and for a Madonna die hard fan since 1983 to say that ... it is heart breaking !!! I did buy the album , will buy any CD single that will see a release date off this album and have a ticket to see her in Chicago in October because no one puts together on a show like Madonna , but I pray her next album will gear more toward \\"Madonna\\" , \\"True Blue\\" or \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" because that to me was when Madonna truly ruled the world and our hearts. Please forgive me Madonna as you will always be my Queen , but this album was not your best to date!was not your best to date!

B0001GMIOE|4.0|The battery worked as advertised.  You get what you pay for, not a rip off no name branded battery.  Great Product.
B000001OAA|5.0|This album has several great songs on it. Highly recommended for listening while riding in cars, elevators, or gettin down with the Mrs.
0767834739|5.0|While I felt the first and third movies in this trilogy were entirely average, this second part of the trilogy is nothing short of excellent. Here's why.    This movie breaks the mold of survival horror movies. The usual formula places a group of characters together and kills them off one at a time over the course of the movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the story progression is much more open ended. We follow the stories of several different groups of characters in different parts of a city sealed off from the outside world to contain the outbreak of a virus. While many characters do die, in this case, it is happpening to unique groups of people all making their own way to survive in a city over-run by zombies. Their storylines eventually converge of course, but the storyboarding developed to bring about this connection is stellar. As icing on the cake, all of these characters feel excellently cast and developed.    There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup.     The directing and set design are also excellent. This movie feels like a horror movie whereas the other two simply pass as alright action movies. The sets are intricately designed, with the very smallest attention to detail throughout. They are dark, filled with well placed streams of light and shadow, and dirty looking, in direct opposition to the clean, slick nature of the first movie. Everything really feels much closer to what the games envisioned in this outing. The directing is outstanding, filled with inspired camera angels, and the knowledge that true horror does not come from throwing scary beasts at us, but through the unknown about any scenario. The church scene is particularily inspired, giving us only the smallest glimpse of three attackers stalking the characters being portrayed. The level of suspense is masterfully built slowly to aclimax around wonderful camera angels and the mood of the set. It is also no wonder why the acting in the movie feels so superb as well. It may not be the stuff of oscars, but it is outstanding by action/horror standards. A great director can bring out the best talent from their actors and actresses. Another classic scene portrays frantic citizens of Racoon city trying to leave through the one exit in the barrier surrounding the city until one man at the front of the line succumbs to infection and the exit is shut tight for good.    Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an A grade movie, and by far the best of the series. If only all three were this good, and the director of this movie had been brought back for the third installment. It isn't a perfect film, but it is excellent in all the most important places. If you only buy or see one movie out of this trilogy, see this one. It is expertly crafted.

0875847706|2.0|I didn't get much out of this book, but it is an easy read. It is mostly a bunch of MBA 101 platitudes that won't challenge your thinking.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|...but I can only think of one word for season 2: AWESOME.    This season was more emotional than the first, but instead of making it a bit soppy it only added to the tension, and worked its way to a gut-wrenching finale.  There were some wicked new nasties that gave me the heebie jeebies and plenty more I would share but I don't want to give away anything!  All I can say is if you liked the first season, you'll love the second and be waiting impatiently with bitten-down nails for the third.
B00008N6N5|4.0|I always liked this movie, but this edition with the new documentary and the commentaries from the director and some of the actors is a nice bonus.  It was definitely worth paying the extra few dollars in order to hear that, especially Woody and Milos each talking about the making of the movie.
B0013FBS20|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with the blu ray version on this movie.  It wasn't as razor sharp as I've seen with other movies on blu ray.  Maybe I expected too much.  For $18.95, it's not a bad price.

0618526412|4.0|This book was on many high school reading lists and I decided to re-read it 40 years after my first time.  It's still a great read, evocative of an interesting period, like stepping backwards in time.  The message on the other hand is timeless, reminding those who think we live in a difficult period that all times are challenging.  Readers sensitive to racial stereotyping would do well to remember that, when this book was written inclusion of African-Americans in a novel, much less one who is a doctor, was very unusual.  Well worth the time.
0756404746|5.0|I don't review books very often; I'm not a very good critic as far as dissecting the flaws of those who write far better than I.  That said, I know when I see something good.  My time is precious, and I hoard it carefully.  When I pick up a new novel, invariably fantasy genre, I carefully consider its worth even before cracking the first page.  I'm just a nobody, really, but I wanted to express my opinion on this one because it's a debut, and I think the author earned it from even the lowest of his readers.<br /><br />This was a great book; a wonderful beginning to a tale that has me eager for more.  The auther has that special knack for setting a scene that puts the reader right there next to Kvothe in all his tribulations.  This book is also a wonderful parable of how legends grow from small events, how truth is twisted by the perceptions of individuals.  This is a fine lesson that I personally hope spills out of the fantasy genre into the real world somehow.<br /><br />Kvothe is not a perfect creature, and not all of his trials are those of others' making.  He's protrayed as a human, just like the rest of us; given choices and the opportunity to fail.  He does fail, too, and the reader can empathize with his downs as well as his ups.  He lies, he cheats, he fights dirty.  He's reckless and foolhardy, but he's also likable, gentle and talented.  The reader (that's me, really) wants to like him.  More, we cheer for him.  I felt, while reading this, like the kid sitting on the floor listening to storytime and not wanting to move or speak for fear that the Teller would stop before I found out what happened next.<br /><br />I also felt like glaring at the other kids when they interrupted with questions or disturbed the flow of the Teller's thoughts.  At the same time, though, I understand that the author pauses with deliberate purpose.  At intervals throughout the novel, we're brought back from the colorful past into the present day's dimly lit Waystone inn to glimpse current events in Kvothe's world.  Each of these breaks in the story told by the friendly barkeep serves as an intermission; a moment to gather his thoughts is a moment for the reader to consider the gravity of the story thus far.  It's a fantastic way to pace the author's novel and I loved it.  The downside is that if one isn't a fan of anticipation, then it can be a bit painful.<br /><br />Yes, there is foreshadowing of things to come once the tale is done, but the story is not about the world around Kvothe.  The story is about Kvothe in the world; and for that, one must begin at the beginning. ;)<br /><br />Buy it, read it, and I hope you enjoy it every bit as much as I did.  It was well worth the lost sleep. :)he's world.

B00005JPNZ|5.0|NO SPOILERS!    The long awaited and much debated continued story of our favorite gallivanting archeologist does NOT fail to deliver!    Wonder what's happened over the last 19 years?  Don't worry, they'll catch you up!  Want an action packed opening sequence?  Ok!  Want fantastical escapes and impossibly magical artifacts?  You got it!    They stuck to the award winning formula for this one.  Indiana continues his humorous one-liners and quips while accomplishing death defying stunts, solving quick witted puzzles, and reconnecting with a favorite old flame!    The new adventurer Mutt Williams is a star ready to fill the master's shoes!  He's not just a carbon copy of Indy, but a unique and fun character that you're happy to allow to fill the screen while our favorite hero takes a breather for a minute.    All your favorite Indyisms are back and you die hard Lucas and Spielberg fans will be thrilled with all the favorite little tricks that you love not only from the Indiana Jones Movies, but from Star Wars as well are brought back to light. ;)    I won't give you any spoilers, but I will say that there's no need to worry about whether or not you will be happy with what happens to your favorite characters.  It's pure FUN all the way through.    Do I have any complaints?  No, I really don't, but some people may find some of the action and plot sequences to be SO completely impossible and (my title) fantastical that you may see it as a bit contrived.  I enjoyed every minute of it and want to see it again!    Summary?    Plot - B+ - I give the plot a B+ because of the fact that there is a bit of a predictability factor in a way that you feel like the writers are playing directly to what they know you want to see, but no less than we would expect from a sequel 19 years in the making.    Characters - A- - Indiana hasn't lost a thing over the years, Mutt is truly his own person and has some great tricks up his sleeve, the villain played by Cate Blanchett is not quite as diabolical as you might think and other than offering someone for them to run away from or fight in the action sequences, she's a bit of a Vanilla villain, but still due every bit of her comeuppance.  Marian steps back into her own shoes well with her fiery personality and disapproval for some of Indiana's methods, while accomplishing some excellent saves of her own.    Action Sequences - A+ - Magic! Pure Magic!  Car chases, whip swinging, booby traps, gun fights, sword fights, car leaps, and close escapes from some truly nasty critters!  You'll be on the edge of your seat all the way.    Dialog - A+ - You'll have some new favorite Indy one liners and quotes for your t-shirts and bumper stickers and the trailer did NOT give them all away! hehe    Score - A+ - Hum along with me!  Duh duh duuuuuuuuh, du du du du du, duh duh duuuuuuuuuuuuuuh, dudily du dununu dununu duuuuuuuuuuuh, yup, it's still there!  hehe  You'll be whistling along the whole time!    Visual Effects - A+ - Seamless and impressive, from the creepy crawlies to the chase scenes to the grand finale, technology keeps an excellent pace.    Cinematography - A+ - Camera angles, wide screen views, and the ability to make you feel that you are a PART of the action are some of the things that make these movies reach out and grab you and pull you in!  I SWEAR I thought a part in there somewhere was in 3-D!  How do they DO that???    Overall - A+ - I'll be going again before the weekend is out!    Watch it, love it, and let's start asking for some Adventures of Mutt Williams movies to follow!

B00000DWHH|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said about this great album?Nothing that   I have heard through the years compares in my mind to this album.Still  sounds fresh and vital.If you can't find at least one song to like off  of Who's Next,move on.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I have this concert and it is really great, but i wonder why some important songs were not included in the DVD, for example, Acid Rain, New Millenium, Jordan Rudess Keyboard Solo, Learning to live, etc. Does anybody knows if this part of the concert was released on a different DVD edition? Becasuse it would be amazing to see Jordan Rudess playing the old DT songs with a new style.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a film for those who love music and children. A great film. Must see
B0013ND30M|3.0|I was one of the fools who bought the 2-disc DVD of Sleeping Beauty a few years ago. Now, of course, Disney is bringing YET ANOTHER one out, claiming it is \\"better.\\" How stupid do they think we are?         It's just like what Lucas just did with the three Indiana Jones movies. Those were released five years ago in what we thought were the \\"Ultimate\\" version. Of course, they weren't.         I'm sick and tired of being treated as a chump by Hollywood. Everyone should boycott these \\"re-releases.\\"
0471267554|4.0|As a young-earth Creationist, I love the concept of this diet, and it really works.  I have been losing about 1/2 lb a day very consistently over time, I have more energy than before, I've lost that \\"brain fog\\" that so many people have on a high-carb way of eating, my general mood and outlook are improved, I'm certainly not starving.  I'm in ketosis most of the time, so my body is a fat-burning machine, without me even trying - I don't even exercise, although I'll start soon. Why is this great from a Creationist viewpoint?  The same principles apply -- what did the first human beings eat?  Genesis 1 tells us that God created 1) grasses, 2) edible plants (vegetables,fruits,herbs) with seeds on the outside, 3) edible plants with seeds on the inside.  Then, God tells us to eat those edible plants. Nowhere does He say to eat grass (grain) or seeds (grains, legumes, arguably potatoes). In Gen. 9:1-3, right after Noah's flood, God finally gives people permission to eat meat.  Sure, people began to eat grain, beans & potatoes later in the Bible, that is an historical fact recorded in scripture. But going back to the beginning, what did our Intelligent Designer create for us to eat, originally?  Fruits, vegetabes, herbs, (arguably) nuts and later on, meat too.  Not grass, and not foods in which the entire food items IS the seed (grain, beans, potatoes).  Some animals can eat those foods fine, but human beings aren't designed by our heavenly Creator to eat those things. We can if we have to, but in a free society today, we have the freedom to eat the way we were designed! I give this 4 stars. I withheld one star only because Dr. Cordain is very vocal about his foolish belief in the fairytale of evolution and its supposed basis for this diet.  Frankly, this should be more aptly titled \\"The Creationist Diet!\\"  It fits perfectly hand-in-hand with biblical Creationism, so I wholeheartedly recommend it to bible-believing Christians everywhere!
0440238609|5.0|I did not think it possible to make an interesting story involving religion, String Theory, Kids saving adults, and war, but Philip Pullman has. Do not worry about the String Theory part, as he never mentions it directly and there is no math involved. However, his ability to create an imaginary, yet believable world rivals J.K Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series.
B000026F7T|5.0|I owned this when it first came out on cassette. I had forgotten just how good the entire cd is. The sound is a bit dated- it is the 80's. But Rick's voice and the quality of the writing still holds it's own. This is blue eyed soul at it's best. 10 quality tracks out of ten. Highly recommend.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I love this CD, and it's definitely one of Mariah's greatest CD's.  She's an amazing singer!
B000CRKW9A|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I hadn't seen it on dvd until I purchased it. Very poor quality/grade dvd though. This movie is not for kids under 18 AT ALL!!! But the great story and great acting make this a must see or own. Loved it when it first came out and it is just as good today. Highly recommended.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The CD arrived in excellent condition with nary a defect and with pefect timing!  It arrived in plenty of time to gift a dear, 47th birthday celebrating friend who is a fan of both of these exceptional artists.
0595440096|5.0|After a well familiar running route becomes confusing, Alice begins a journey into the unknown rarely encountered by middle-aged women.  Many mis-steps follow before early onset Alzheimer's Disease is diagnosed. Gradually we begin to understand the dangers and isolation of her reality in Still Alice, beautifully crafted by Lisa Genova. It is often said that Alzheimer's Disease is harder on the family than the patient, but Ms. Genova  gracefully presents the world according to Alice, true to the daily difficulties but never ignoring the all encompassing over-riding pain experienced by an accomplished woman watching herself decline.  Ms. Genova  skillfully manages to keep us thoroughly engaged while wonderfully weaving the science, denials, family conflicts and treatment options into an amazing page turner. Partner or patient, child or care-giver, this book is a must read for all involved in Alzheimer's.  For those of us who have not yet been touched by this disease, Alice's story will feed your soul.       [[ASIN:0595440096 Still Alice])
B00005BPKD|5.0|Although this thing is technically supposed to be a \\"learn to swim\\" aid, I discovered that it is an excellent boogie board for young children.  The shape of the back and the fact that it's inflatable make it perfect for catching waves with virtually no effort, and the handles and flotation make it easy for the kids to stay on top and ride it all the way into the beach.  The distance of the wave rides was amazing compared to a styrofoam boogie board.  If you want to get your kids into boogie boarding this is a great way to introduce them while avoiding frustration.  Can't comment on using it for a swim trainer.
0425220931|5.0|Victor Wooten weaves a lyrical yarn that is simple and pure in language and deep in the beautiful mystery of the spirit. Not just about music, this book reminds me of Richard Bach's classic \\"Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah.\\" A must for musicians and artists, and those who like to think and explore and dig a little deeper into their souls.<br /><br />Download the podcast of  Victor's interview with Bob Edwards on XM radio for a great companion experience.
0385338724|4.0|I love all of the books from Sophie Kinsella.  This latest one was good, but not outstanding. I found that she concentrated too long on the amnesia throughout the book and did not spend enough time resolving the plot in the end.  The end of the book came very quickly and was resolved in a matter of minutes.  The characters lacked depth, and their relationships were never really fully developed.  Having said that, it WAS an entertaining book and I will keep it in my personal collection.  I still respect the book because it comes from Ms. Kinsella, whose track record speaks for itself. I DO hope she continues with her Shopaholic series and writes about Becky and company once again! My all-time favorite book of hers is The Undomestic Goddess - that one has it all.
0061537934|5.0|. . . this story of a dog who wants to be human will enter your psyche, your soul, and yes, ultimately your heart. It's THAT kind of book. Think Owen Meany meets Curious Incident. Think bigger than the ubiquitous \\"boy meets dog\\" love story that so many publishers are rushing to get onto the shelves in the wake of Marley and Me. Although this is a love story, it's more. Way more. Enzo and  \\"Racing in the Rain\\" are touchstones for humans striving to do their best in a world that doesn't always make it easy, trying always to find the path to peace, love, and understanding. Do yourself a favor: Listen to the dog.
B000F7CMRW|5.0|Syriana is deliberately confusing.    You have to stick with it or you will be lost.    The characters are not one-dimensional: all represent shadings of good and bad, and all can be corrupted by the system of Oil at Any Price.    The only fully decent character--the reformist Sheik--is killed by the CIA, for that very decency.  (He wants to help his people, rather than the oil companies.)    The Matt Damon character grows in moral maturity before your very eyes.  When his son dies, he must face the choice between giving up his wife and doing the right thing, or selling out and keeping his wife.  To his credit--and with terrible difficulty--he lets the wife go.    The U.S. govt. lawyer, on the other hand, states his price and sells his principles (and the sheik, and the sheik's country) out.    The Clooney character comes to realize the nature of the business he is in only when it turns and bites him--in the shape of gruesome torture and threats to his family.  Like the Damon character, he renounces evil in the name of good, and gives up the whole thing.    Naturally, as in all politics, might makes right, and the good guys lose.    But we see how such a system destroys people and countries, and recruits self-righteous terrorists who aren't going to quit.
B0000042HV|5.0|Shostakovich's string quartets are as much the supreme masterworks of 20th Century music as Beethoven's were of the classical period. I hardly dare say more about them; they are profound on every level, and like Beethoven's, they grow more profound with every listening.<br /><br />Shostakovich, in a sense, discovered the Fitzwilliam String Quartet when its members were undergrads at Cambridge. He entrusted the first western performances of his last three quartets to them for premiere, and they in turn made the first western recording of his full quartet cycle.<br /><br />Many full cycles have been recorded since, and people have different favorites. I have three sets; this one by the Fitzwilliams is my own choice for the most insightful and incisive. But here's the important part of this review. Although $46.00 more or less is the standard price, I've just happened to notice that there are several sets available used for less than $10.00! Some used-CD dealer in Outer Slobbovia is gonna say a prayer on my behalf tonight!

0060853980|5.0|To those few who found the book \\"amusing, but not laugh out loud funny\\" may I make a suggestion.  Leave your house once in a while.  You will discover an entire planet filled with people who are not exactly like you.  Even more shocking, they may find something hilarious, at which you would barely chuckle.  It's called individuality.  Look it up...as soon as you are able to pull your heads out of your b***s (of course I meant books, get your minds out of the gutter! Then learn how to co-exist with people who do not agree with you on everything, without becoming judgmental.  I think they call that \\"growing up\\"....
B000OZ2CZW|1.0|Rihanna isn't really a great singer, and you realize this quickly after watching her sing live again and again. I've never been a big fan of her music, but this album really just isn't cutting it. She is Pop/R&B for the moment, until someone else comes along as she came along on Christina Millian, Amerie, Kelly Rowland, & other singers. They all have the same bad break-up songs & happy make-up songs. I don't know what makes Rihanna so different or better than Kelly, Amerie, Christinia Millian or Ashanti.

B00005JPNZ|3.0|\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spieldberg\\"<br /><br />1957: WWII is over and the US and Soviet Union have emerged as the worlds super powers and the Cold War is begun. The Soviets have heard of an artifact that they suspect will provide them with the ultimate weapons. The only person who can locate this item is none other that Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford)\\". Jones is captures and forced to go to work and adventure ensues...<br /><br />I think Lucas and Spieldberg made the same mistake with \\"Kingdom of the Crystal\\" as many do when making sequels trilogies and the like. They worked harder on pushing the action sequences and special effects than they did on the story and how it unfolds which is usually expected but the fact that this mistake was made by these two makes it a little more disheartening an unexpected.<br /><br />The Good: The good you enjoyed in the other Indy movies is present in \\"Kingdom\\" as well. Harrison Ford actually still manages to pull the Indy character off. It was nice that they re-visited the Marion Ravenwood character (Karen Allen). Good performances by Cate Blanchett as Irano Spalko who is Indies nemesis this go around and Shia LaBeouf as well.<br /><br />The Bad: I think they pushed too far with the unbelievable escapes, lucky falls, near death misses etc. I realize this in an Indiana Jones movie and everything isn't supposed to be believable but there is still a line as to how far it should be pushed and I think the line was shattered. I can't go into detail without giving spoilers so will just leave it at that. As I said a classic mistake in that they tried to out do all of the predecessors in the wrong way.<br /><br />They added CG special effects in some scenes. I liked the fact that all of the old movies were done with practical effects and I think they should have stuck with that. That was kind of a signature of the Indy franchise.<br /><br />I also think that the comic relief was overdone. When you couple the fact that the comic relief was overdone with the fact that the actions sequences were overdone the finished product almost has a campy feel to it which isn't good.<br /><br />Overall: \\"Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull\\" isn't terrible and is still an enjoyable movie for the most part. If you are a fan of the franchise go check this out but don't expect something equal to \\"[[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]]\\" as this movie pales in comparison.couple the fact that the comic relief was overdone with the fact that the actions sequences were overdone the finished product almost has a campy feel to it which isn't good.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This production marks a highpoint in the medium. It entertains you and makes you feel intelligent at the same time. The picture of history that it paints shouts with authenticity, and the insights into the personalities of the founding fathers is enthralling. This very well may be the release that forces me to start going Bluray. Well done!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|...and at first, it WAS handsome enough to tempt me...i even bought the DVD.  Now I ask myself, \\"why?\\" I've watched it only once. I really can't stand it, sorry to its avid fans. But, when one has watched Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and a 6-hour, faithful-to-the-book adaptation, this really pales in comparison. A LOT. I really don't know what they were thinking when they cast Keira Knightley as Elizabeth. Instead of being a spirited young woman, she seems to be an egoistic teenager who can't keep her mouth to herself.   Matthew McFadyen as Darcy was alright, but I agree he was rather wooden- Colin Firth spoke with his eyes, and through this we saw every unshaped thought and desire of his. It really disappointed me how so much of the book was cut (although more could not be expected from a movie), and the unfaithfulness to Austen's time period was simply shocking. When Jane was sick, Mr Bingley should NOT have walked in to see her! It was highly inappropriate and although I sound like a pedant, such small details ought to be considered in making the movie more memorable. Mr Bingley looked like a lovesick teenager, which was irksome too. *Sigh* maybe I expected too much...but is it wrong, when high-quality, endearing literature is in the mix?     In its favor; the music and scenery. Both were exquisite, and (to others) patched up the movie's faults. Sorry to sound so harsh, but that's the way I felt.
0393312836|5.0|Eerily intoxicating, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess delivers a graphic portrayal of a futuristic totalitarian society. The epic journey of the protagonist Alex from his extreme highs to his disembodying lows serves as the focal plot throughout the novel. The themes of violence, mischief and revenge leave the reader anxious to see what happens next. Burgess is able to evoke an array of emotions from the reader toward Alex such as anger during his reckless days to empathy after he is left a shell of himself as a result of Ludovico's Technique. Though the nadsat language takes some getting used to, I thoroughly enjoyed this provoking, poignant read.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki is a genius. This movie was a delight, with the lovely soundtrack   and the breathtaking animation. Beneath it lay the story of a girl's transformation into maturity and a deeper understanding of the world around her. I was enthralled, and I plan to see all Miyazaki's animated movies. Howl's Moving Castle is another magical adventure, watch that as well. Both transported me into a land of make-believe, and i enjoyed every minute of both.
061891868X|5.0|I have been reading this book on the commuter train, and it is making me look forward to my hour long commute.  If you read science books for non-scientists this is one of the best I have ever read (especially if you have read the Brian Greene books, like \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" because they help contextualize the author's (Lee Smolin) perception of String Theorists enthusiasm).  This book is part science, and part critique of academic culture. There is also a good dose autobiographical anecdotes.  Very entertaining, easy, and fun to read.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Frankly, I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr., playing a superhero. This probably had to do with the initial impression I had from what I had read so much about him - faltering years as a drug addict & jail bird in real life.<br /><br />I last saw him as the conniving Dr Kovak in 'The Shaggy Dog', & also as the rogue special agent, John Royce, opposite the characters of Tommy Lee Jones & Wesney Snipes in the thriller action movie, 'US Marshalls', on cable television.<br /><br />With the last movie, 'The Forbidden Kingdom', in the same movie theatre, my gym buddy & I saw a brief trailer of 'Iron Man', which had sort of piqued our personal interest.<br /><br />Yesterday, my gym buddy & decided to go for a movie in the late afternoon, & we chose 'Iron Man' at Jurong Point.<br /><br />In a nut shell, 'Iron Man' was more of a CGI-boosted special effects extravaganza. I read from the papers that the movie costed US$165 million to make.<br /><br />The movie was based on a superhero character from Marvel Comics, creators of 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men'.<br /><br />Story-wise, it had a relatively simple plot.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr., played Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist & also an inventor extraordinaire in designing & building high tech weaponry of mass destruction for the US Army.<br /><br />His company was known as Stark Industries, founded by his late father, Howard Stark, who was involved with the Manhattan Project.<br /><br />While traveling in Afghanistan on a business trip, his convoy was ambushed in a war zone - he was injured, ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets - & was kidnapped by a group of militants, headed by a lunatic who wanted to control the entire Middle East.<br /><br />Kept alive by a make-shift electro-magnet embedded above his heart, apparently designed to prevent the shrapnel from puncturing his heart, Tony was forced by his captors to build a missile with metal scraps & electronic leftovers in a cave-enclosed prison.<br /><br />Instead our hero, with his usual cool arrogance & drawing on his inventive genius, hatched an escape plan revolving around a crude metallic armoured suit -the advent of the prototype, 'Iron Man'.<br /><br />Of course, he managed to escape - with the electro-magnet over his heart intact - & eventually returned to America, seemingly a changed man after seeing the death & destruction caused by his company's weapons.<br /><br />With that, he decided arbitrarily that Stark Industries would stop producing military weapons, much to the chagrin of his mentor & associate, Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges), who somehow had other sneaky ideas of his own.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tony began experimenting with the electro-magnet imbedded over his heart & exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor - apparently a power-yielding generator that could emit enough juice to keep his heart shrapnel-free, & at the same time, could provide adequate power to a new armoured suit he had in mind.<br /><br />So, while our hero was cranking his new armoured suit, Stane was secretly conniving with the militants in Afghanistan, who apparently had managed to salvage the original work plans of the armoured suit built in the cave during Tony's captivity.<br /><br />It was during this movie segment that I realised that Tony's unfortunate ambush in Afghanistan was all the while being set up by Stane in a futile attempt to take over Stack Industries.<br /><br />With the original work plans secured from Afghanistan, Stane managed to assemble a team of specialists to build a modified version of the metallic armoured suit, nicknamed 'Iron Monger'.<br /><br />The remaining segment of the movie - in fact, for all the excitement we were waiting for - displayed the power struggle between Tony & Stane, eventually culminating into a violent clash - with CGI special effects, of course - between the two heavy metal behemoths, 'Iron Man' & 'Iron Monger'.<br /><br />[We must accord our thanks to the ingenuity & inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios.]<br /><br />If you have the opportunity to watch the sci-fi action movie, 'Transformers', you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans & vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork.<br /><br />When compared with 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men', I had this notion that 'Iron Man' was more like a slapstick comedy to me.<br /><br />The two actresses, one playing Tony's Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) & the perky television reporter, were primarily eye candies. I reckon they were there just to show Tony's flamboyance.<br /><br />In fact, the most fascinating gadget in the movie, to me at least, was the flash-drive-sized sonic paralysis emitter, which Stane used to harmlessly knock out his opponents. I would love to have one of that.<br /><br />Did I enjoy watching the movie at the end? I sure did. Was it entertaining? Yes, especially the action sequences & witty dialogue. Was it worth spending the two hours in the movie theatre? Yes. My gym buddy felt likewise.<br /><br />At least, I now have a different impression about Robert Downey Jr.rmers', you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans & vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork.

B0013BNY2Q|1.0|I've been an REM fan for years. Some albums have been fair, some poor, some inspired and brilliant.    This is trash. The 'music' is bad enough, but the 'wall of noise' production style is a crime. No tonal balance, no dynamics, just a mash of undifferentiated sound. Ugh...    If I could have given no or minus stars I would have. This was a complete waste of money and time.

0385334206|5.0|Breakfast Of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut *****<br /><br />Breakfast Of Champions is satire at it's all time best, and Breakfast of Champions is Kurt Vonnegut's all time best, the only other novel of his to even come close is Slaughterhouse-Five. Which is a must read. But as I was saying, BoC is a not so subtle comment on the social structure of America in the early 1970's, but what is so amazing, much like with Orwel's Nineteen Eighty Four, and Huxleys Brave New World, is that this is more relevant now then it was thirty-forty years ago. His take on war, racism, and politics strips them of their importance and breaks them to their core and makes you realize how much energy and time we spend on these things. He does the same with Sex, and success, and material goods as well.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it is a strange one, and one that is at sometimes hard to follow, or it would be at least if it weren't for the excellent drawings depicting what is currently happening in the story. Yes this has pictures but it is in no way a graphic novel in the technical since. As Killgore Trout a novelist makes his way to a arts rally across the country he finds himself face to face with a man named Dwayne who believes his storys are true and has become a psychopath because of it. It only gets weirder from there.<br /><br />The book is not tired or a strain to read ever, it is one of the most enjoyable reads I have ever had, and I would go so far as to say that Breakfast Of Champions is one of my top five books of all time.

B000005IU1|5.0|The Stooges *****<br /><br />I'm sorry but before I start I just wanted to say that when I saw the 1 star review I started laughing so hard my eyes watered...but anyway I digress....<br /><br />So once upon a time, in the greatest city the world has ever seen, Detroit, Michigan, my place of birth a musical revolution happened. The precursor to punk was born in the form of The MC5 (motor city five) and The Stooges. I'm not going to go into the whole back story on the album as that page has been written one to many times. But what I will say is that this, The Stooges is one of the most breathtaking rock n' roll albums ever!<br /><br />Iggy was the one from the beginning, even here on this, The Stooges debut album you can tell he was ready for a change, ready for everything to be his. Though he was Iggy Stooge then. With Ron and brother Scott Ashton on guitar and drums, and Dave Alexander on bass, this was one hell of a lineup. Ron never got the credit he deserved as a guitar player, much like Iggy didn't as a frontman. Aside from maybe the Rolling Stones and the Kinks, The Stooges are the worlds greatest garage rock band.<br /><br />'1969' is easily one of the greatest and most important songs in the history of rock, it along with the even more important and even greater, 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' are credited by many as being the first punk rock songs. The groove along on 69 is astounding. The really embody the emotion and attitude of the whole movement, though it was about six years away. 'We Will Fall' is pointless. It fails at doing what it tries to do, it does not entertain, and is almost impossible to finish. I know they wanted avant garde but this just didn't work like it did on Funhouse. 'No Fun' for me might just be the best song on the album. As a teenager you really couldn't find a better song to relate to, honestly. 'Real Cool Time' and 'Ann' are not stand outs but are great to listen to still. 'Not Right' and the closer 'Little Doll' go hand in hand, to appreciate one you need the other, with 'Little Doll' being the stronger of the two.<br /><br />This was the start of something amazing, a start to some of the greatest rock n roll ever played. The Stooges were an institution, even their reunion album The Weirdness was killer! For Iggy and rock n roll fans this is a great listen.th 'Little Doll' being the stronger of the two.

0784011176|5.0|After viewing this film more than a few times, I asked myself why I enjoy this film so much. I really didn't like what I had found. This film showed me what is wrong but appealing in society. I do stand by my five stars because the textures and postive aspects this movie has to offer are inumerable. Although...<br />A look at the \\"dark\\" notes: 1) We must ask ourselves in this modern society is it right  to cast  a very young minor in a supporting role in a movie that she shouldn't be allowed to watch. 2) a sex relationship issue. The husband almost feels entitled to \\"rape\\" his wife. 3) Adultry made acceptable (nothing new) but there are others.<br /><br />Pacquin and Hunter's chemistry and acting are impecable and the film deserves a positive review for this reason alone. The ironic line that delivers it all perfectly for me is when Sam Neil(Stewart)in trying to locate his wife asks Anna Pacquin(Flora)where her mother has gone, The frustrated little girl, who has learned too much about adult relationships yells \\"TO HELL!\\"
1594489505|3.0|Then again, maybe it is a tall order to live up to a book of that magnitude. While 1199 reviews say otherwise, I can only speak for myself when I say this.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is a story that centers around two women battling the last 40 years of oppressive Afghanistan history. The first woman, Mariam, was born a illegitimate child and quickly shuffled off by her father and his wives to marriage from a man in Kabul at the age of 15. Her husband is a grade A ***hole who forces her to wear a burqa despite the fact that many women in Kabul go without theirs. The second woman, Laila has a more legitimized upbringing and is born just before the Russians come in and take over Afghanistan. Unlike Mariam, Laila believes she is destined to do something great in her lifetime but those dreams are dramatically put on hold when a misguided missile is fired in her house, killing her parents and uprooting her very life as she knows it.<br /><br />Ironically, Laila recovers in Mariam's house with her husband Rasheed. However, Rasheed says Laila cannot stay in their house and is worried about his reputation. With the alternative being put out on the street, Laila reluctantly agrees to become Rasheed's second wife. Despite hating each other at first, the two end up forging an unlikely friendship and end up making sacrifices that are truly moving for each other as the book wears on.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book, which is why I didn't give it two stars. However, it just didn't have the same appeal, the same freshness as Kite Runner did. That and the fact that the book just continually got more and more dark in it's overall tone and while Hosseini tries to convey a message about how things are in Afghanistan, I just thought it was too depressing this time.
0307346617|5.0|I have recently read the book known as \\"World War Z\\" by Max Brooks. And I have to say it is one of the best books I've read, granted I am a huge zombie fan. But the way Max describes the events in this book about how this infectious disease spreads throughout the world and reanimates the dead, and how the zombies chase humans down like wild animals and eat them as if the world was one big buffet. I almost started to believe this book this actually happened, haha. Another thing I liked about this book is that in the story there is this \\"Interviewer\\" (which I'm still not clear who he really is)-who travels around the world and interviews people about their experiences with the undead, and the people he interviews goes from high political and military people to the average citizen. The dialogue in this book is phenomenal; the way the author has the people talk in this book makes me think I can actually hear them talking. One other thing I like was that every chapter is a different stage in this apocalyptic hell they call a \\"Z War.\\" 1st chapter: Warnings, this chapter explains how the mass population could see signs of what was to come. 2nd chapter: Blame, this explains of who was responsible for this, and how the government didn't help with the problem. 3rd chapter: The Great Panic, this one tells about how the people who were interviewed survived their horrific encounters. There are more stages in the book but I will leave that up to you to read the rest of the book to find out.   Overall I thought that this book was a great and well written, so if you ever see it at your local library, I advise you to pick it up.

0684803356|4.0|In the past few days I have finished reading the internationally acclaimed book \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" by Ernest Hemingway. Before I began reading this book I had heard and read from many that the book was a classic and a very good read; after finishing the book I have to say that I completely agree. This book well deserves the praise that it has been given over the years; it is a classic in every sense of the word.   From Hemingway's unmatched descriptions of the beautiful Spanish countryside to the deep inner thoughts and struggles of the people. Hemingway has captured the true inner feelings of the Spanish people in their struggle for their idea of freedom, from the gripping oppression of fascism.    Yet he goes even further, in the unlikely relationship that develops between Robert Jordan and recently rescued Maria. He is still able to show that there is always some good even in some of the darkest situations. From betrayals and tragedy to unlikely and unexpected aid Hemingway covers all spectrums and interests     The only criticism I can give this book is concerning the ending which I personally found unsatisfying but that is for you to decide for yourself. In conclusion I find this book to be a great read for any who feel they are a skilled enough reader to fully appreciate the majesty of this work of art.

0316166685|4.0|Young Adult- Susie Salmon was murdered and now she is stuck in Heaven, watching her family fall apart as her killer goes unnoticed.  She wants so bad to go back to live her life but knows it's an impossible dream.         Lovely Bones is a mixture of real life drama and mystery.  Something new is constantly happening, always keeping you on your toes.  New clues being discovered revealing the murder.  With everything that happens each person's character is being tested more and more.       I love realistic fiction and being able to relate to what is happening in the book   Real life issues that could actually occur.  This book covers a numerous amount of topics that kids can relate to, from separation to your first kiss.  It makes you feel as if you are a part of their life.       The one bad part of the book is that the ending was not good.  I was not expecting what had happened.  I, for the most part, like a book to be somewhat predictable, and this book was the total opposite especially the ending.  The only good part about the ending was the irony in it.       If you like a book that is full of twist you will like Lovely Bones.    -Kenda B.
0375812024|5.0|My son loves any aircraft since his father is a pilot so this book is great. It takes some kids on a tour through an airport and all of it's parts (mind you they do it in an airplane themselves)teaching a lot about the ahppenings. Scarry always entertains.
0142407380|4.0|Yet again, Alex Rider is back. A near fatal bullet wound won't stop him either, as Ark Angel has as much action as the previous books if not more.    The book begins with Alex in the hospital recovering from the Sniper's attack from last book. The hospital quickly becomes a battle zone when four armed men come in during the night to kidnap a kid. The kid is no normal kid either, as he is the son of Nicolei Drevin one of the richest men on the planet. Being Alex, he rushes in to save him. Before you know it the book starts an incredibly long road trip. This includes London, Washington D.C., a Caribbean island named Flamingo Bay, and finally to the book's most unbelievable final location.    The book sometimes teeters on the edge of believable and non-believable, however I feel Anthony Horowitz did a good very good job at making a mostly believable yet exciting adventure. It also feels like Anthony did a lot of research on this book even without the series' first acknowledgement section.    The book also does a good job at explaining why Alex is being locked up instead of just shooting him on one of the many times Alex gets caught. However, there a couple instances near the end that would have been so much easier for the bad guy to bring a gun other than going through all the trouble that they did.    If you like a book nearly bursting at its seams with action and danger, than this book is definitely for you. However if you're more laid back then you let this one fly by you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This documentary is freakin AMAZING!!!!!! I have learned many things about our planet that I did not already know. I have had my jaw hit the floor every time I turn on this DVD. No kidding. The production quality is A+. The cinematography and camera work is A+. This is without a doubt the single greatest achievement of any documentary film maker. Spectacular in every way!!!! I will buy it for many this Christmas!
0671027344|5.0|The Book The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a very good book. It is mostly aimed toward teenagers, but anyone could read it. The book relates to high schoolers, especially the ones who don't usually fit in with the \\"in\\" crowd. It has a good look out on teenagers and how rough high school life can be.     I liked this book mostly because when you're reading it you think of yourself in that position. It made me think about what I would do if I was stuck and had to deal with the battles everyday of what Charlie (the main character) did. One other thing about the book that made me think was Charlie's dad would say, \\"There is people who have it worse than we do.\\" So it sort of makes you think about the brighter side of things.     Charlie discusses his life in a diary sort of way. Charlie talks about his daily life, the ups and downs of high school, family, and his friends that he's made along the way. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a good and easy book for young adults to relate to.
0743496736|2.0|I had a very hard time finishing this novel. First, I found it incredibly hard to connect with *any* of the charaters, feeling that they were overdramatic about small things, but didn't make enough of a fuss about real issues in their lives. I also felt that Picoult's portrayal of high school life was highly cliche. The reason that many YA lit appeals to adults is that it gets into the culture of highschool, not the made up Hollywood version. Picoult would be able to take a cue from that, but still apeal to an adult audience. Overall, I was very dissapointed in this book.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|It was very hard to like the author.  It felt like a long whine. I put the book down after the third chapter.  For those of us that aren't globetrotters yet there are better books to read.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I love this movies it shows life can be a big adventure.<br />I can relate cause I'm learning disabled, I learn slow.<br />I remember when kids uses to call me stupid, cause I didn't<br />learn the way they did.<br />It's sad how mean kids can be, but just remember kids usually<br />do what they see their parents do.<br />I think this is one of Tom Hank's best movies.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen!  I can't believe I wasted $20 on it.  From the unending farewell party (boring, too long, banal conversations, need I continue) to the chase across the city to \\"save\\" the girlfriend (please!  the character didn't have that much \\"character\\"!) this movie was a total waste of my time, the actors time, and everyone elses time and an insult to Godzilla fans everywhere. As bad as the Japanese Godzilla movies were, they were GREAT compared to Cloverfield!! This movie is going to the \\"sell it quick before everyone finds out how bad it is\\" pile!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing Jillian's other 5 DVDs for a total of 5 hours per week every week for months so I felt ready to try her new offering.    I decided to start with level 3 (no problem right?). It was tough. Really really tough. I'm now doing level 3 around once per week and it is getting easier.     This tape is another fabulous set of workouts. If you're used to her other tapes I'd suggest that you may want to start at level 1 or 2 and work up to 3.
B000OV170W|1.0|I read this book just over three years ago and one quote still sticks out: \\"Darkness is relative.\\" This is coming from the misunderstood arsonist son. Every page had a fortune cookie of wisdom, along with tired metaphors and characters that evoke no empathy. The popularity of this book makes me a little ashamed to be a woman, in that they seem to LOVE it. The ending was a cop-out, not that it mattered much; an interesting ending wouldn't have been enough to save it. I also would like to point out that I was excited to read this and the idea seemed it had a lot of potential. A waste really.
B00006I53S|5.0|I dont know how this lens can be put down for the range and versatility it offers.  No, we aren't going to be using this as our primary lens on the 5D, 1DSMKXX, etc. etc.  But on the cropped sensor cameras, it produces exceptional results all in a compact package.  Lets see a point and shoot camera do what a currently selling Canon XT/XTI or even used 20D with this bargain priced lens can do by comparison.  People not liking the lens should be shooting with the 5D and their good glass, not the other way around...
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|It's rare when, after so many years of waiting for new material from an artist like Donna Summer, one can truly say, The Queen Is Back and it was worth the wait.  Wow!  What a collection of fresh, current, and eclectic material.  She made a wise choice in convincing her label to release an album of new material over covers.  Where does one start?  From the moment you listen to the first song, the current anthem single Stamp Your Feet, to the exclusive It's Only Love, which is sure to be another club pleaser and follow up to the #1 hit I'm A Fire - in between you will find a kaleidoscope of sounds and colors.  Mr Music should be a definite new release sure to please hip hop dance fans. Slide Over Backwards is the hidden diamond among all the colorful jewels - doesn't sound like her at all which is I think the sign of a true artist.  Other notable tracks are Crayons, Science of Love, Fame (the Game), and the one ballad Be Myself Again where she confirms why she's the called the queen.  I think Donna has outdone herself and created a masterful production. I rank this album right next to The Wanderer as one of her best!  So Madonna, keep your Hard Candy - I'd rather play with Crayons!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|The Canon BP511A is a very long lasting battery for a DSLR based camera.  I do not know how the electronics of everything work inside a DSLR to give better battery life, but this one has been as long lasting a battery one can ask for.  Highly recommended to get a second or third one of these for vacations.
1595141715|5.0|I ran across this book while looking at possible books for my Honors English class to read.  I didn't choose it because I could practically hear the parent complaints, but I did mention it to my current class.  The kids took the opportunity to read it and tell me it was a MUST read.  I must say my students are right.  Anyone who works with teens, interacts with teens, or has teens should read this book. As a teacher, I could see my students in the characters of this book. (Please slap me if I ever become a Mr. Porter)This book was so compelling and accurate that I was literally bawling my eyes out by the end.  While I don't think I could get away with assigning this in my class (Stupid censorship people), I am recommending this to absolutely EVERYONE (teachers, students, parents) I know.
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|I hated this version from beginning to end. Keira knightly's jutted out mouth and her fake accent makes me cringe. And Mr Darcy was completely stiff and I agree with one of the reviewers questioning why he was like a brooding Heathcliff. Ugh, although I agree with everyone that the A&E/BBC version was much better  I still don't like the fact that Elizabeth is always portrayed as the prettier sister instead of her sister which is suppose to be the beautiful and sweet one. I might be nit picky but I just find that aspect of the book to make Elizabeth seem more charming and the story more movable that a plain, tom boyish, intelligent girl wins a mysterious, handsome, wealthy man. I so wish James McAvoy agreed to be Mr. Darcy. It would have been much better with him in it and probably win more awards. He was stupendous in Atonement and so was Keira Knightly. Ugh!!!!! What a waste of film.
0060837020|5.0|I found myself saying aloud \\"I know\\" \\"Excatly!\\"  To be cliche and say that I found myself in this book is not justice.  I felt for her in all of her thoughts, and actions.  I was constantly saying to myself \\"she's not crazy this is normal.\\"  Terrific book for anyone who ever finds themselves thinking that the day to day actions we do are frivolous.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|Yet another example of excellent casting here paring Gene Hackman with Danny Glover. The film is riveting, and even while telling the story of Bat 2-1, it delves into the heart of Vietnam, where Bat 2-1 made his 18-hole sprint to freedom. Highly recommended.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|... this film simply left me baffled. With no plot, and little point, it seemed like a waste of wonderful talent.<br /><br />I've heard about this movie for years. Now that I've finally had the chance to see it (or at least, most of it, as I found it so tedious that I shut it off about 3/4 of the way through), I found it pointless.<br /><br />I'd suggest skipping it, but based on the high number of positive reviews, I must be missing something.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|If you can suspend your disbelief and cynicism for an hour or two..., then you may leave this movie feeling that despite all of our flaws that there is something good, true and dare I say it noble in all of us.<br /><br />You can read the other review for a synopsis of the film, but for me two scenes come to mind that reveal the true magic of this wonderful film<br /><br />When James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett sings and dances for the sick little pig, a truly human and tender gesture of affection for Babe, I find myself choking up with emotion (that's not a tear, that's a speck of dust in my eye).<br /><br />Similarly when the Farmer Hoggett places his faith and trust in Babe to be able to perform in the sheep trial, when despite all the laughter and ridicule he stands firm, until the trial is over and the gate is closed, that moment my friends is pure bliss and transcendence.<br /><br />Perhaps it is become there are few characters as masculine or manly as an Australian farmer, but beneath his gruff exterior there lies a human being, and this film shows that sometimes despite what the world tells us, our humanity can only be found in our most human of moments.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00004YZFR|4.0|Much enhanced picture and sound quality from the original theater version. It seems there's also added footage. It's a great documentary of a historical social event. It does seem to drag a little, perhaps the times have changed or the added footage is too long, but its definitely worth it anyway. I highly recommend watching this film.
0385338082|5.0|I finished the book in less than a day. I was so intrigued with the story that I kept reading. I only wish this was part of a series.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|The video effects are amazing and the story is well worth watching again and again.
0756404746|5.0|I am probably too old to still be reading fantasy books, but this one is simply beautifully written. The story opens subtly and gradually, but before long you are so caught up in it that you will not put it down. Beautiful story, gripping plot. Whether or not you are a fan of fantasy, you, take a look at this book. You will not be disappointed.
B00132D808|5.0|I used to hate PATD music, but then I could not get Nine in the Afternoon out of my head. Hesitated to buy the CD because....I have enough CDs with only one song I like. But finally caved. It is different from their first CD, which I have since bought also. Pretty. Odd. is a whimsical,happy accomplishment. And isn't that a great form of escapism?
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only remotely scary part is when the crawly creatures attacked in the subway. Using a B2 bomber to try and kill a monster in an urban area? Stupid. They obviously had no military consultants. Climbing up 30+ flights of stairs in order to crawl across to another building that is leaning over and resting against it to try and save someone who for all practical purposes should have been dead? Idiotic. And what was with the sappy \\"I love you! I love you too!!\\" ending? All monster movies require the willful suspension of disbelief, but this dreck requires that you go waaaay beyond that in order to enjoy it. It also requires that, given all that they are going through, they still have the presence of mind to make sure to record the entire event. The only redeeming quality was that I got to look at the yummy Jessica Lucas for an hour or so. After being completely enthralled by LOST for the first two seasons, bored by the third and having completely given up on by the fourth, JJ Abrams has proven that he is long on hype and leading you down a rabbit hole, but can't close the deal.
0061537934|5.0|This book has a lot of soul. Saw this book in Starbucks and had to give it a try. Pulls on all the emotions from humor to tears and was an engaging and enjoyable read. The metaphors of racing and living were apt and the dog as narrator is quite insightful. It's like a Nicholas Sparks novel-The Notebook but with dogs, death, racing cars, and court fights. Also Enzo the dog is like Lassie as a family counselor. Enzo the dog is the man- almost.
0061245097|5.0|It's a rare occurrence that has me giving a book a 5-star rating. But this one gets it and more!<br /><br />One Foot in the Grave is a truly stunning sequel to Jeaniene's debut novel. She doesn't go for the hard sell as some sequels fall prey to that whole BS of bigger, more, better! Instead Jeaniene just does what she's good at.<br /><br />Telling the damn story.<br /><br />I laughed all the way through this book. (that is when I wasn't gasping for breath at the sexy sexy parts :D ) From beginning to end it was entertaining, heart-stopping, touching, and just plain fun. I'm not kidding, I don't think I've read a book lately where I've laughed quite so much, Jeaniene has a great way with quick, witty dialog that's not forced at all.<br /><br />Everything from Cat and Tate snarking at each other, to Bones' great one-liners, to Juan saying (to a newly revived friend) \\"You have to come back, Tate is boring and all Cooper does is train!\\" (seriously I nearly hurt myself laughing there) speaks of her characters depth and personality - they have history and we know it.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this story. It's truly entertaining and all-around awesome.
0307265730|4.0|Jhumpha Lahiri always has a great writing style and ability to explore relationships between characters.  This is again a short stories that are really good.  I have read her earlier two books. I think she needs to move to different set of domain as I do see repetitions of Indian immigrants in American that to only in Boston & New York. Most of her characters are also very elite.  I hope she tries to change her demographics in her next venture.
0375842381|5.0|Phillip Pullman's magnificent trilogy started with The Golden Compass and continued with The Subtle Knife before reaching its conclusion with The Amber Spyglass, and there is much to be said for his achievement. He has told a story of sweeping grandeur that succeeds on a number of levels, with believable and affecting characters, amazing incidents of great beauty and terror, and layers of meaning which make you think as well as feel.    It all starts with Lyra, the heroine - an urchin in an Oxford University which exists in a parallel universe, where all humans carry with them an external \\"daemon\\" or animal spirit which corresponds to the soul of man. Lyra's daemon, Pantaleimon or Pan, has not stabilized his form, (which takes place after puberty) and takes the shape of a number of different animals, from mouse to moth to leopard.    This parallel Oxford appears mired in a Victorian-like era marked by a very powerful and reactionary Church. There are five known planets in the sky, the wealthy travel by Zeppelin, and though the glare of \\"anbaric\\" light is common, so also is the warm glow of naphtha lamps. Their physicists (called \\"experimental theologians\\") have discovered a class of elementary particles called Rusakov Particles or \\"Dust\\" which have an affinity for human life, and may in fact be alive themselves. This Dust is attracted to adults, not children, and the Church is disturbed by this, equating Dust with original sin.    We are quickly swept into an adventure with Lyra, whose absentee parents prove to be the mysterious Lord Asriel and the beautiful, ambitious and amoral Mrs. Coulter. It is Lord Asriel who has set his sights no lower than to topple The Authority himself, the corrupt ancient of days, oldest of divine beings who lives in a fortress in the clouds and cynically claims to be the creator of all. In this effort he has the assistance of angels, divine beings from the fall so long ago. Lord Asriel is opposed in this by his former lover, who has gained considerable power in the Magisterium by heading the General Oblation Board, the fearsome child-stealing \\"Gobblers,\\" who have been spiriting kidnapped children away to the far north.    Action in The Golden Compass moves north, toward the frozen lands of the aurora, because that is where Dust is most detectable, and where the towers and buildings of another world are visible in the sky beyond the northern lights. When we finally arrive at the terrifying research facility called Bolvangar, where the Gobblers do their Dust-related experiments on children, we have come to a very powerful additional level of narrative, for though this place is run by seemingly familiar, genteel Victorian Englishpeople, it reminds one of the laboratories of Dr. Mengele, a frightening parallel for parents reading the book.    When Lyra walks into that other world at the end of The Golden Compass, she has already had an incredible adventure, with her friends the Gyptians, Iorek Byrnison and the armored bears, the proud and beautiful witches and the rumor of angels. She has learned to read the Alethiometer or truth teller, the golden compass of the title, which has sent her to the ultimate north. And she has betrayed her best friend unknowingly, and been betrayed herself.    In The Subtle Knife we meet Will Parry, whose arctic explorer father has been missing since before he was born. Now 12 years old, Will has grown up fast, protecting his ailing mother from her inner demons, and from the mysterious men who have come (from where? Lyra's world?) looking for John Parry's papers. Will accidentally kills one of these men, and from then on he is on the run with no looking back.    Will escapes through a portal into another world, the same world that Lyra has walked to. They meet in Cittagazze by the sea, a city deserted by adults fearful of the vampiric Specters who drift almost invisibly on the air and suck the life from these people. Will takes Lyra back to his Oxford, where she meets a physicist named Mary Malone who is studying Dark Matter, and has reason to believe that it is intelligent. But Lyra and Will are hunted and wanted for questioning in our Oxford, and Lyra has her Alethiometer stolen by an aristocrat from her world, who sets for them a task if they want it back.    It seems that several hundred years before, a guild of scientist/philosophers in the crossroads world of Cittagazze had forged a knife sharp enough to split atoms - or cut doorways into other worlds. The bearers of the knife became adept at stealing from these other worlds, but tragically the doors they opened allowed the Specters to come in, bringing horror and sorrow. This is the task Lyra's aristocrat sets for the children (for he cannot enter Cittagazze because of the Specters): if they bring him the subtle knife, he will trade it for Lyra's golden compass.    Will and Lyra enter the haunted Torre degli Angeli and Will fights for the knife, becoming maimed as a result, with a wound that stubbornly refuses to heal (shades of Parsifal). As the new Bearer he is instructed in its use, and becomes as adept with the knife as Lyra is with her truth teller.    With the help of witches who have followed them to this world, they escape a mob of evil children, and the witches try to heal Will's wound without success. The witch queen Ruta Skadi follows a flight of angels to the distant world where Lord Asriel prepares his armies to fight the Authority, and returns to tell about it. And Dr. Malone has an instant message discussion with her shadow particles, which identify themselves as angels, and send her (protected from Specters) to follow the children into the world of C'gazze. The book ends in confusion and alarum -- a cliffhanger readers had to wait several years to resolve.    Before we get to The Amber Spyglass, a few comments. These books were inspired by Paradise Lost, and are full of allusions to the Hebrew Bible. The Authority, who Asriel is rebelling against, was the One who called himself Yahweh and claimed to be the Creator, when he was really just another angel. In other words, in the world(s) of His Dark Materials, the God of the Bible is a liar and a fraud, and His Church (read: all organized religions) is a Blakeian thief of innocence and inhibitor of joy throughout the ages. This helps explain Pullman's well-known antipathy to C.S. Lewis' (delightful) Narnia books, which Pullman detests for glorifying an afterlife (in The Last Battle) at the expense of the living world. I acknowledge this without further comment, except to say that The Last Battle is probably most readers' least favorite Narnia book.    There are also many allusions to the story of Adam and Eve, particularly in reference to Dust as Original Sin, which send the Church into paroxysms of agitation. We come to see as the story unfolds that Lyra is tremendously important, with a destiny that affects all the worlds. How could this be otherwise, with Lord Asriel for a father (who can bend time itself to serve his rebellion) and the exquisite Mrs.Coulter for a mother, she of the most indomitable spirit and force of will anyone has ever seen, whom even the Specters obey? Of course, Will himself is an embodiment of this spirit - even the witches are afraid to look him in the eye. If Lyra and Will are to become Adam and Eve, with Dr. Malone playing the part of the serpent, well, this is just another layer to the story.    I believe The Amber Spyglass will be long remembered for its bravura centerpiece: Lyra and Will's frightening, depressing and ultimately inspiring journey down into the land of the dead, but that's not the only arrow in Pullman's quiver. This big book is full of wonders, including angels, tiny aristocratic Gallivespian spies, Harpies, the wheel-riding Mulefa, and War in Heaven. Nor is it short on human emotion.    I feel a strong reluctance to give away any details of The Amber Spyglass. It begins by resolving the cliffhanger of The Subtle Knife: we know where Lyra is, and crosscut to all the parties trying to reach her. And we are privy to her feverish dreams of the land of the dead, where her friend Roger languishes on a vast darkling plain of ghosts.    Readers of Dante and Homer will not be disappointed - the land of the dead that Pullman has created is very real and frightening. It is all part of the age-old deception of the Authority: that believers will go to Heaven when they die, because instead all who die in all the worlds go down into the land of the dead. We feel uneasy when Lyra and Will and the lilliputian Gallivespians cut through to a world in search of food for their journey and find a stable full of dead horses covered with millions of buzzing flies, the corpse of a farmer with his throat slashed, and soldiers with guns coming up the road.    They cut again, but with difficulty, into an identical world where the farmer stands wide-eyed in his kitchen, clutching at his throat, knowing he is dead. \\"I can't stay here,\\" he says, and indeed the road is now filled with people from the town, dead people, walking towards the land of the dead. I shouldn't say more.    These books are among the best young/adult books I have read, and I hope you will enjoy them.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I was blown away by the power of her vocals at almost 60 years old. This entire album drives like a ferrari on the autobon.....It moves you emotionally up and down and with a great fresh sound. Donna's songs are updated, fresh and new.  Her song with Ziggy Marley (crayons) is great along with Stamp your Feet, The Queen is Back, Mr. Music, I'm a Fire,Driving Down Brazil and Being myself again.  What is great is you hear her joy in singing on this release. You know she wanted to record this and was not obligitory from a record company. I highly suggest this to the Donna Fans of the past and has the balance and weight to be very appealing to a much younger audience..This is a must for the Summer of 2008....It is worth every penny and will have many number 1 songs of this album.
0743455967|5.0|This nonfiction work sat on King's desk longer than any of his novels, and the wait was worth it. Encouraging, practical, and down to earth, this brilliant essay on writing weaves expertly between personal biography, nuts-and-bolts advice, and philosophy of writing. No writer, aspiring or otherwise, should be without this masterwork from the master.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|After I saw this terrible movie, and it wasn't just me, I wanted half of My $$ back. I was disgusted. I was BORED. I was let down and led astray. buy the other one Planet Terror instead!!!!!!! How can they have a double disc.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|What can I say that hasent been said. This album is great. This album sounds like it was recorded back in 89' which is great. The thing I really like about this album is that rocken Dave never changed Megadeths style. They have always been straight ahead thrash metal band which is the best type of rock. If you like Megadeths old Rust In Piece work. I am sure you will love this masterpiece. Right when I turned on this album it brought a smile to my face I loved it so much. There is not one bad song on this album. There are some that are better than others but I have never heard a Mega song that has let me down. I really hope they come out with another album soon I am sure It will be just as good.
B0010X745K|5.0|Prior to this movie release, of all the stories by Stephen King, only the non-horror ones were any good.  Theatrical releases such as Christine and Dreamcatcher were utterly horrible, while the made-for-TV horror movies such as The Tommyknockers and the Langoliers were also bad.  On the other hand, the non-horror ones were excellent.  These included Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and Misery.  Then came The Mist, released in 2007.  This adaptation of a short story is probably the best horror movie released this decade that was not based of a Japanese story.  Though based on a short story, the movie clocks in at over two hours; long for a horror movie.  The plot is very believable, and the casting is excellent.  No big names in this movie, instead the story has a cast of a dozen characters that drive it forward; all of whom play important parts.  The ending is also great.      As to the content, there is some gore, but it is not excessive.  There is some violence, but it does not dominate the story, and instead is only an extension of certain subplots.  The scenes requiring special effects are kept to a minimum, but those scenes are extremely well done and all the monsters look quite real.  Most importantly, there are no stupid scenes in the movie.  There is no scene of a guy running from a monster and then tripping.  There is no scene of some lady hiding from a monster, and then giving away her presence by tripping.  Each and every scene was well thought out and well done.  All in all, a great movie.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|hummm....sonido crudo..poesia derramada en forma desprolija..altanera...momentos brillantes, momentos erraticos...profundos baches, belleza de a golpes...en fin...monotono no es...sencillo de escuchar tampoco..pero creeme que te escupe en la cara el rock crudo, insensato, salvaje de estos cuatro jinetes fugados del apocalipsis!!!!!!!!!!!!! tomate un vino y escuchalo!!
B000W11RJK|5.0|this album is one of the quietest in my collection; it even beats some of my mofi titles.  when this seller says the album is near mint, believe it.
0141439661|4.0|Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot.
0452289963|2.0|The author is more or a philosopher than most \\"How to Books\\".  I found it very hard to follow what he was trying to get the reader to do to make their life easier.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I love the movie so much very well put to together and beautiful! Loved the music and just recently decided to buy the soundtrack for it, you forget in the movie there are several people actually making these songs not just computers! Cant stop listening to the soundtrack! Movie, music all of it very beautiful!!
3832790810|5.0|I love this photographers work.  Beautiful, compelling and very well done! The theme of private rooms/hotel rooms makes the images have a certain story behind the provocative style.
B000000XB9|5.0|si, viejo...esto es parte de la biblia del rock..que mas se puede decir..ahora..queda alguien sin escucharlo????
B000002HRE|3.0|This album is not terrific, as it has some filler. That filler is, generally, very bad. But when its good, this album succeeds. For some reason, the thrashing burn-outs never matured, however, and they are here giving undeserved 1-star ratings. It's all very unfortunate.<br /><br />This album is a good, solid, hard, blues-based, rocker. It is interesting enough to keep you listening. The first half of this album is very good.<br /><br />If you like hard rock, check it out.
0143034901|4.0|Utterly gobsmacked, as would say my British friend who recommended this. This is one of the most beautiful and compelling works of fiction I've read in a long, long time. It throbs with the poignant, haunting tension between loss and hope. One of the few books I'll almost certainly reread in years to come.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Excellent fantasy adventure with some unexpected heroes.  Warrick Davis gives a sincere portrayal of a struggling family man/farmer who still has dreams.  This version also has a full length commentary by Warrick Davis and several other bonus features.  Great Buy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  It has compressed the story of Pride and Prejudice a bit but for the most part remains true.  Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth.  I am a huge Austen fan and find that she embodies the spirit of Elizabeth.  Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy makes me drool everytime he comes onto the screen.  I only wish the movie had been longer!
0307237702|5.0|Get a view of the other guy. It's there, in black and white (no pun intended). Is this the way you want the country of your children, grandchildren to grow up in? If your no longer here, would you feel your family is safe with this man being the leadership of your family's future?  Is he perfect, not by a long shot. But ask yourself, if you had to hand over your children. what ideas, values and life lessons would you want them to embrace. This may be what your looking for.
B000002TPS|4.0|This album is as underrated, as it is misunderstood. Every album that Megadeth has ever done has been different from the other. They always keep it heavy, but are wholly willing to try anything new, so long as it is quality.<br /><br />I appreciate far more the thrash/speed metal Megadeth we all love, then, say, the \\"Risk\\" or \\"World Needs a Hero\\" MD, that takes getting used to or just isn't any good. Having said that, this album is high quality, as far as written material goes. True, don't expect \\"Rust\\" or \\"CTE\\" level decibles, but there is material to treasure here, I don't see how that can be in question.<br /><br />Most songs on here, while more metal than thrash, are extremely well written. I personally love the majority of the songs on this album.<br /><br />Check it out.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|One of the most amazing movies I've ever seen! It's magical and beautiful and very entertaining at the same time.
0307387178|5.0|Having been to some of the places outlined in this book, you can understand why someone would want to go \\"into the wild\\". The sights are truly breath taking.  The west is a totally different culture, in my opinion, and geared toward the artistic and bohemian type of individual.  That being said, I found this book hard to put  down and totally haunting. My teenage son and I debate this book often.  It has left in my mind, the thoughts that noone truly knows what young children are thinking and the impact certain situations have on their life.  I found it disturbing that this child was intelligent, from a good background, and no violent abuse to speak of.  I often think of the saying \\"youth is wasted on the young\\".  Had he had more wisdom and more experiences in his life, would he have made the same choice?  At times, I am angered by the way that he did not have the kindness in his heart to let his family know occassionally that he was alive and well.  At other times my heart breaks, because in this child's eyes perhaps he didn't think he would be missed.  I found this book to have a profound impact on my life to the point that it has changed my view of teenagers and the world around me.  If you are an avid reader, it is a must have.
1932100660|5.0|I got this book as a gift and then I gave it to someone as a gift. It made me think about what I am eating. As a result of the information, not marketing hype, I have made changes to my eating habits. I feel healthier and have lost weight. It is a very good book for those who want to improve their health through food.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars. It is right up there with another genre classic, \\"Rust In...\\", also by Megadeth.<br /><br />There has never been another example of pure, uncompromising, metal that remains such a mainstream success. These guys had to compromise nothing, and because of that, this album is well-deserving of its acclaim. It wasn't simply the singles that were great, it was the album - in its entirety! There is not a bad track on here.<br /><br />Very \\"techy\\" thrash/speed metal with some of the greatest thrash solos of all time.<br /><br />Essential if you love metal.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|You really can't go wrong with Buble.  I'm not as crazy about the song selection as some of the his other cds, but that's completely personal preference.  Overall - just a wonderful collection of music, performed well.
B000ZN8036|4.0|This movie is based on the story of Christopher McCandless, a young man that leaves behind the promise of his college degree, (potentially) Harvard Law School, and all the trappings of upper-middle class life for his attempt to find real life. He didn't think it could be found in contemporary America with its crass materialism, consumerism, divisions, lies, and discord. For Chris, he thought that life could be found by a return to nature, away from civilization & the trappings of society. For me, the movie was haunting and very sad. I couldn't sleep after watching it.    I believe the movie was affective, because it whet my appetite for more. I wanted to understand more fully what made Christopher McCandless tick. In perusing a few reviews this morning it seemed that most tied Chris' desire to enter the wild due to American materialism, consumerism, and the general disenfranchisement with American life. While all of this is true, I think all of this is simply the fruit of what appeared to be a terrible family life, which the materialism, consumerism, etc., was the whitewash for otherwise ugly tombs. He saw his parents, who achieved the \\"American Dream\\", and they appeared to be an absolute mess - abusive, adulterers, maybe drunks, greedy, selfishly ambitious, &, for Chris, the tipping point seemed to be learning that he and his sister were \\"bastard children\\".    In my understanding, you take that family context and a guy that was probably pretty sensitive and keenly aware of sin in the world (even if he didn't have the right categories to articulate it), and then you throw him into the 'education' of Emory University and you have a time bomb waiting to go off. I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of his education at Emory he was a bit of a misanthrop and was longing for something different. Through his readings of Thoreau and others, he thought a 'return to the wild' was the answer & shedding off of the filthy rags of hypocrisy and lies (his families story). Yet, when he got there, he learned that the 'structural' problems in society are there as well. He learned that life in a state of nature is 'short, brutish and harsh', as he started to starve and the flies, maggots and wolves didn't care about him.    In many ways, although I was blessed with good family, I am sympathetic with what I learned of Chris in the movie. Middle class morality isn't sufficient, especially when it is the veil covering hypocrisy, sin, & a want of love. A college degree, a new car, a new apartment, a good savings account, & all the other 'blessings' can't provide us with what Augustine and all of us desire - 'to love and to be loved'. In my mind, Chris is like Kafka's \\"Hunger Artist\\". Many are impressed that he could leave it all behind and starve himself, but for him it was easy. He would tell us, \\"I have to fast, because I couldn't find the food I liked. If I had found it, believe me, I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else.\\" Unfortunately, I have a feeling that he was still hungry when he died.
1576754227|2.0|At the start of this book Tracy says that he will not go into the psychological or emotional aspects of procrastination, yet that is exactly what procrastinators need.  If you don't know why you do things, how can you change?  I know all about goal setting, prioritizing tasks, doing the most difficult task first -- that's not the problem.  I know what to do, but still can't get over the mental block.  This book says, Just Do It, and you'll feel better, and want to do more!  This is useless advice.  If I could just do it, I wouldn't need a book.    Unless you're completely in the dark about goal setting and time management, avoid this book.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG FOR ME TO LIST THE MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS MOVIE [setting, missing scenes, character portrayals, etc.], BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IT IS TRITE AND NOT WORTHY OF BEING CALLED \\"JANE AUSTEN'S P & P\\".  I WENT TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT, BUT LEFT BEFORE THE END BECAUSE IT WAS SO \\"untrue\\" TO THE NOVEL. AFTER CATCHING IT ON CABLE A FEW WEEKS AGO, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS \\"I'M SORRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK IF THIS OSCAR-NOMINATED MOVIE IS ALL THEY HAVE TO GO BY.\\" THE FIRTH/EHLE VERSION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THIS. IF YOU ARE NOT AN AUSTEN FAN AND/OR HAVE NOT READ THE NOVEL, EITHER READ THE BOOK OR RENT/BUY THE FIRTH/EHLE MOVIE.
0595440096|5.0|When I opened this book, and I almost didn't as it's subject is one that gives many of us pause, I was immediately drawn into the world of  brillant Alice. Whose world has begun inexplicably to be lost to her in small pieces.   Genova has presented this story of early onset Alzheimer's with tenderness and care, giving the reader a finely drawn picture of what happens to a family,friends,and colleagues who must watch a loved one disappear before their eyes.   I'm so happy I not only opened the book and read it to it's conclusion, and I have recommended it to so many people. It's a worthy read on a very timely subject.
0143038419|1.0|Ok....in all fairness I did enjoy the first section as the author traveled through Italy. I gave up on it when she got to India and I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. I tried to like it, but it bored me. There are far too many great books out there to waste your time or money on this one.
B000RZGIOA|5.0|I dont know why these people are crying but the movie is out on BLU RAY now. Paramount has swithed to Blu Ray and will start releasing films on BLU RAY. I Allready own it and its great
B000ZOXDG4|5.0|I was deliriously happy to see that this sequel to Elizabeth was in production and waited most impatiently for its release.  We bought both segments in the glorious HD format and were delighted by the quality and depth of color and detail.<br /><br />The Golden Age does not disappoint as so many sequels do and it most definitely lives up to the integrity of the first movie.
B000M3452Y|4.0|Lots of great songs on this cd, especially the first four songs on the cd. The first song rocks. The third track, \\"North American Scum,\\" will have you jumping up and down and chanting like an English football hooligan. And the forth song, \\"Someone Great,\\" will bore its way into your subconscious like a mole. But while there are truly some catchy songs here, I have to admit sometimes it does get a bit too repetitive with the Casio-like keyboards and early 90s electronic effects, sounds I know far too well from a misspent youth. This is still worth getting, though.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Always loved this album, really great guitar work by Eddie. I'd like to see some unrealeased stuff from this era maybe live or demo studio stuff or acoustic. You know it's out there
B000002J03|5.0|One of my fave's of Zepp.  Best rock drummer of ALL time...  More original beats than anyone I can think of, after playing drums for 30+ years IM not even close...  Classic songs as well..
B000RF7XZI|5.0|Elizabeth has occupied a spot in my personal Top Ten of all time movies since it was first released.  I was ecstatic when it was released onto the HD format and was not in the least disappointed by the quality!<br /><br />For anyone interested in the Elizabethan age, this is a must-see movie.  Cate Blanchet is luminous as Elizabeth I, the costuming is sumptuous, set design and scenery are breath taking, the acting superb and the direction without fault!
B0013FNC38|4.0|Jason's newest CD is amazing and those of us who love Mraz best from the front row of his concerts will find that the EP's nicely balance the different studio sounds he chose for the full length CD.  As always, the star of the show is his voice no matter whats going on around it.  From a true fan since Live at Java Joe's, this new CD experiments with some different sounds but is of course quality music. I love it!
1400049628|5.0|The book is presented in a serious fashion; sort of like mocking the other \\"survival\\" guides out there (namely the \\"Worst Case\\" books). The fact that it is \\"serious\\" in nature makes it a hilarious book.    The book is divided into three sections:    1) The first section explains how to survive a zombie attack. It covers everything from securing your home, to working in a good, to clean up procedures, and preparing for the psychological effects of an outbreak. The book follows heavily on common errors made in zombie films and proven method that is common in all films. Personally, I don't think this section is the reason why the book is popular. The second section, in my opinion, makes this book extremely popular and worthwhile to purchase.    2) The second section explains history of outbreaks. The book blames zombie outbreaks on a virus. The history section goes back to the \\"BCE\\" era in time until the present day explaining all sort of zombie attacks and method of how people survived. This section is not in a comedy tone - it is in such a serious tone that it's hard to tell if these cases are actually true or just made up. I give extra credit to the author for making such an outstanding history of attacks. Honestly, I think it takes a really creative mind to make up these stories. It's very interesting to read and at the end, you'll feel like you're a zombie expert. I heard the author made a second book, \\"World War Z,\\" that follows heavily on the second section of this book.    3) The third section is just three pages long, but it's the \\"breaker\\" in my opinion. It's just a blank sheet that you can \\"record\\" zombie outbreaks or possible outbreaks. This made me laugh hard - something I haven't done in a long time due to a book. There is one sample outbreak file that made me laugh hard. It explains that there is a news story about how people got sick and died, and the person who wrote the report is asking neighbors and preparing for an outbreak. Hilarious. I decided totry this out. I made a copy of the outbreak case, and studied news stories for suspicious deaths and such. I found one, and it made me laugh but at the same time I felt horrible because someone actually died and I'm making up a joke paper at the decease's expense.    Overall, this book is funny. I highly recommend the book just for the second section about the history of zombie outbreaks. It scary and the author sound serious enough to make you think twice about the validity of the stories.
B000002KKK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000002KKK Degüello]]  The Deguello album may be considered a peak performance by this legendary Texas blues-rock group. It contains such classic songs as \\"I thank you\\", \\"She loves my automobile\\", \\"Fool for your stockings\\", \\"Cheap sunglasses\\", and several more. Different from previous albums, Deguello introduced a landwinning new kind of production, taking traditional blues and rock to higher and much more interesting levels. Many old and new fans say that Deguello is the Best of ZZ Top. I am certainly inclined to agree. Guitarist Billy Gibbons' inspired vocals and raw-elegant guitar style with a genuine blues feeling in the numerous solos is greatly matched by the work of the rythm section (Dusty Hill and Frank Beard). Some think that blues may be dull or repetetive in its basic structures, but the arrangements of all songs on Deguello prove in every single instance, that this is a grave misconception. I recommend Deguello to all music lovers out there, who want to explore groudbreaking blues-rock in its finest form.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is a fun movie and that's about all. A 4th film was rumored since 1997 but they couldn't agree on a script they liked. If this was the best script of them all, then I'm scared on how bad the others were. But still there's a lot less to whine about than there was with episode 1. This movie is never dull like that was. It's goofy and cartoonish though. But I didn't have a problem with that since the others have had their share of unbelieveable moments. Like Indy using a raft as a parachute and landing on to a river of all places in Temple of Doom for instance.<br /><br />  The action alone really isn't the only goofy thing about this one though. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress but I stopped taking her villain Russian character seriously after she tries to read Indy's mind with the palm of her hand. Shia LaBeof befriending monkeys the second he sees them and swinging on vines with them wasn't needed as well. But still, people shouldn't whine so much. I'm just happy to finally see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again. I mean all the reviews here that say stuff like Spielberg and Lucas let me down again just make me wanna puke. I mean when Lucas is coming up with the story you should know that you shouldn't be too excited any more. The Star Wars Prequels are examples of that. His imagination has gone to a galaxy far far away.<br /><br />  The movie still managed to make me feel like a kid again though. No matter how goofy the action got I was still entertained. Ford is at least in good form as Indiana despite his age. He also has some fine chemestry with Shia LaBeouf (Transformers). They almost make as good of a team as Ford did with Sean Connery. It's also nice to finally see Karen Allen's character reintroduced as well. While Ray Winstone (The Departed) and John Hurt (Hellboy) are fun in supporting roles. The movie wasn't perfect like I said but I still left with a smile and so should other fans. They should just be happy that the movie was finally made and it could have been worse. Like, Indy could've had a new sidekick called Jar-Jar Binks for instance.the movie was finally made and it could have been worse.

B00104QSOM|5.0|Some people have already hailed this as a masterpiece topping nearly all films in history.  I saw one recent list of the greatest movies ever made that put There Will be Blood as number two, following only [[ASIN:B00009W0WM Casablanca]].  Perhaps that kind of message is somewhat consistent with the film's themes of false prophets and capitalist hype.  Time will tell if this movie deserves that kind of glorious praise I suppose, but I will agree without a shadow of a doubt that among the many tall trees in 2007, There Will be Blood is the tallest.  It is an astounding achievement and P.T. Anderson ([[ASIN:B000PAAJZ6 Boogie Nights]], [[ASIN:B000PAAJYW Magnolia]]) has officially settled into all of his massive potential.  He had not made a movie in five years but has always shown flashes of brilliance.<br /><br />There Will be Blood is apparently based to some degree on the Upton Sinclair novel [[ASIN:0141031700 Oil!]].  The movie tells the tale of a silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) who stumbles upon oil deposits in one of his mines.  The first part of the film shows us how he gradually refines his drilling techniques and how he eventually creates a massively successful oil enterprise.  One of his expeditions into a small town suspected of having vast oil reserves is framed in greater detail and introduces us to Eli (Paul Dano), a faith healer and head of the Church of the Third Revelation.  Many other significant stories involving Plainview's adopted son and a half-brother he didn't know he had, also portray the moral dilemmas he faces, but it is his dance with Eli that is more fascinating and layered than many cinematic conflicts I can think of.  Blind faith and devotion, whether it be in God or money, so easily devolve to greed, dishonesty, and self-destruction.  This is a dark movie with an incredibly powerful screenplay.<br /><br />Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead put together the music and the [[ASIN:B000XA50MK soundtrack]] is as effective as we've come to expect from a P.T. Anderson movie, as is the first rate cinematography from Anderson partner Robert Elswit, who has put together a wonderful career even outside of Anderson's movies.  However, stylistically this is restrained by comparison to Anderson's earlier films and I actually think it serves to make the film far more effective.  Almost everyone loves the hip booming [[ASIN:B000002UKO soundtrack]] and Tarantino-esque dialogue of [[ASIN:B000PAAJZ6 Boogie Nights]],  but it would not have worked in a serious film like this, and Anderson seems to have grown out of caring about that sort of thing.  Good for him, I really enjoyed forgetting I was watching a movie and instead stepping into the cutthroat world of Daniel Plainview for two and a half hours.<br /><br />The one element of this film that will be remembered in the annals of cinematic history is of course the Oscar winning, and more than Oscar worthy, performance of Daniel Day Lewis.  This guy is never less than great in anything he has ever done and seems to come out of seclusion every three to five years or so to show the rest of the world what acting really is.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a performance that is definitely better than this one.  He is a remarkable and gifted actor, and showcases that here more than anywhere else.  On the other hand, I think Paul Dano's performance will be overlooked.  The young actor was highly praised in many circles for his performance in 2006's [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]], a dramatically different performance in a dramatically different movie, but here is even better and is definitely one to look out for.<br /><br />There Will be Blood offers great visuals, great performances, and significant insights that some viewers may be sensitive to.  I felt a subtle contemporary social commentary that points to overwhelming hypocrisies happening in our modern world.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.pect from a P.T.

0061120073|5.0|This book was very popular when I was in eighth grade (1968.)  Lot's of the girls were reading it.  While I read books that were considered \\"girl\\" books then for some reason I avoided A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  Thirty years later I picked it up in the bookstore and couldn't put it down.  I avoided rereading it for a few years because I didn't think I could enjoy it as much the second time around but I did.
B0017U7PT6|4.0|If you went to this movie expecting to: see a decent reinvention of the prehistory genre, filled with some imagination, a little more thought, better acting, more story line and less cheese than you normally find in this type of movie, then you were probably pretty happy.  I like cave man comedies also, but the absence of fart jokes and zug zug (an old movie now that some may not get the reference) was actually refreshing.  We have seen all that before.<br /><br />For those somehow expecting a cinematic classic (rather than a cult classic), no wonder you were dissapointed! If you compare this movie WITHIN it's genre, it really is one of the best. It has plenty of natural humor without the cartoonish nonsense. It IS well acted for what that's worth. There is a plot.  I did find some moments I personally would have done differently, but I think there is an alternate ending available.<br /><br />It is a fantasy movie afterall, so suspension of disbelief is something you take with you before you even buy the ticket. There are plots and subplots enough to carry a CGI adventure beyond just the visual spectacle. Cammille Bell is stunning and well worth the price of admission alone. It's a terrific movie for what it is.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I don't really care that much about the new extras, the real need to double-dip for this release is the improvement of the video for the three films. If you own the original release you'll have noticed just how un-watchable the three movies were, specially because of the incredible amount of specs and marks which I've found distracting and downright intolerable; there's not a +/-5 second period in which a spec does not appear on I & II while the video in III is affected by terrible color and brightness.  While watching the new release of the Bond fims a few months ago I concluded I couldn't be long before the GODFATHER series received a similar treatment and sooner rather than later, here we are. I really hope the price for this edition is brought down by Amazon from the 62.99 it currently stands but, even if it doesn't, two of the greatest films of all time are worthy of just swallowing and making such expense. I like III very much too but obviously it isn't in the same league with the first two, just about no other film ever made is.  10/13 UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: Having finally seen this DVDs: fantastic picture, much improved sound. There are plenty of images and sounds there to find which simply couldn't be appreciated in past editions. But you'd think that for $62.99 they'd get the labels on disc 4 & 5 right ! $62.99 !!!! You can find this collection on e-bay for half the amount. Very sorry to say that for the last several months, Amazon has been pricing themselves out of being considered the best option in DVDs.
B000QRIGLC|1.0|After reading the product reviews especially by the publishers, there was no reason to read the book except to fill in the details.

B000000993|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to Tool.  Being a long time fan of progressive rock tool seemed to fit that mold so I picked up \\"Aenmia\\" but it did not do that much for me.  Then when \\"Lateralus\\" came out I kept seeing glowing reviews for it on progressive rock web sites to I decided to give Tool another shot.  This time it clicked and I \\"got it\\".  Since that time I have become a big fan and went back and picked up \\"Undertow\\" from their back catalogue.  I don't think this one is quite as strong as some of the albums that came later, and the production is a bit on the muddy side compared to the later discs, but this is still a great album that introduced the band to the masses with the song \\"Sober\\" which is still a fan favorite.  \\"Prison Sex\\", \\"Bottom\\", \\"Swamp Song\\", \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Flood\\" are all great grinding metal / prog that still sound unique.  Maynard Keenan's vocals soar over it all like a roaring engine.  I have grown to really appreciate this band and finally got the chance to see them live last year.  \\"Undertow\\" is not their best, but it is certainly worth checking out.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Okay, I'm pretty new to Porcupine Tree, having only gotten into them this year.  I started off by purchasing Deadwing and In Absentia.  Deadwing is a darn near perfect album from beginning to end, and In Absentia isn't that close behind.  So I had really high hopes for this album (Especially considering all of the great reviews on Amazon).    Now don't get me wrong.  Musically and sonically, this is one fantastic album.  It may take a few listens, but there are some melodies here that are truly haunting and will remain with you for a long time.  Steven Wilson is simply a song writing genius (and just an all around musical genius, really).    But what I think turns me off about this album (at least more than the previous two) are the lyrics.  I kinda get the whole conept about the alienation and isolation of our youth, but I'm a 38 year old guy and quite frankly, I don't want to hear an entire album about bored teenagers.  Give me something I can relate to.  Okay so In Absentia was (more than likely) about a serial killer.  But at least it's a realm of fantasy I can get into....and not a sociological statement like this album.      Yes, I agree that there is a problem in America (and in many other parts of the world) regarding the fact that our youth have become isolated and alienated and spend way too much time doing nothing but zoning out in front of their TV's and X boxes and getting into prescription pills to zone out even more.    But do I really want to listen to an entire album about kids wandering around the mall, stoned and bored?  Ehhhhh...not really.  Hearing songs about a guy burying bodies in his shed (Ala In Absentia) may not be any more releveant to my life than this particular topic.  But at least it's more fun to listen to.  :-)    Bottom line:  The music and instrumentation is brilliant.  But I have a real hard time relating to the lyrics.  Steven:  For the next album, maybe lay off of the social and political lyrics.  Or at least include a song ortwo about a girl riding around in a car in her summer dress with her hair blowing in the wind (A little reference to Deadwing there).  :-)
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is what the title says. I can never get bored of this CD. The maturity and musical orchestration weaved with the melancholy of Tolkien's tale is nothing short of magnificent. If you read the book (The Silmarillion), this will not only sound good, but cut at a deeper emotional level. An album to be cherished!!!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|I found the settings/costumes of the time period to be very well done. You feel as if you are back at that place in history. Even though the film didn't follow the book faithfully, over all it was a good solid representation, and it created an appropriate sense of creepiness and suspense. The depictions of the crimes were very realistic, and horrifying.<br /><br />The cast did a wonderful job, especially Robert Downey Jr. He grabbed the limelight nearly every time he was on screen.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|What is this movie about?  Blair Witch Project style filming of a gigantic monster that wrecks havoc on New York City (Godzilla strikes NYC).  Cloverfield is the government name for the incident.  The camcorder is found at some later point and it shows the disaster from the viewpoint of a few \\"regular\\" people who try to escape and then through various reasons wind up close to the monster.  Somehow these regular people don't put down the camera even under the craziest of circumstances.<br /><br />There was a lot of marketing about this movie and this got me very interested in the film and it reminds me of a set of books I read long ago from Gregory Benford that started with \\"The Ocean of Night\\" and then progressed on to \\"Across the Sea of Suns.\\" In them there is talk of animal monsters that are flung to earth by some super advanced aliens to keep humanity down.  All through the viral marketing for this movie, I kept thinking that this was an \\"adaptation\\" or recasting of Benford's fantastic book series -- who knows though, maybe its just a recasting of Godzilla.<br /><br />Regarding the movie:<br /><br />What I loved:<br />a) The concept -- there is just so much that goes untold that just makes us wonder what this thing is, where it came from, the parasites or baby creatures.  Is this an invasion from space?  Are the creatures sent by some super advanced race to attack us (ala Benford's Across the Sea of Suns)? Is it the product of pollution? evolution? engineering by humans (oh dear god, no not another movie of pollution gives breed to monster)?  Please let it be Benford's vision.<br /><br />b) The fact that they left enough open for us to speculate<br /><br />c) The fact that there is so much left to make a sequel about<br /><br />d) The acting came across as real<br /><br />What I hated:<br /><br />a) Jerky filming - this is ala blair witch but gosh everything is jerky the entire movie.  Starts off slow and then jerky jerky jerky jerky -- gosh.<br /><br />b) The sometimes silly things that were done by characters....like going towards a gigantic monster that is wrecking havoc in NYC (I'd be running away - always away)<br /><br />b) So little is told, that this movie lives in my imagination more than in the film<br /><br />c) if they make a sequel and they tell us more, they're going to displease some of us when the monster turns out to be some creation of a polluted world or something that gets awakened when the polar ice caps melt -- etc.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />a) if you love sci fi - watch this, you'll like<br /><br />b) if you're a regular person - stay away, you'll hate<br /><br />c) if you like monster flicks - watch, you'll like<br /><br />d) if you hate jerky reality filming - stay away, you'll hate<br /><br />Overall, to me this was just a giant advertisement for a 300millon dollar summer blockbuster sequel if they do it right (but please no more shaky single camera filming) -- give me a story, and infocus special effects --- give me Benford's world!

B000001E21|5.0|The ONLY downside to this entire CD is that with the exception of Desert Song, Fractured Love, & Two Steps Behind....each of these tunes had original releases as B-sides.  For the most part, those songs have been tweaked here and there for reasons only the band can answer.  I am a Leppard fan through the Adrenalize album.  Aside from the song Promises, Euphoria and each release afterwards has gone farther away from the Leppard I grew to love.  When Love & Hate Collide was even a track which had it's start long before it was released and the \\"demo\\" version contained the \\"last\\" recorded Steve Clark guitar solo from the studio.    This release culminaates alot of loose ends for the Lepps when it came to the legacy of Steve \\"Steamin\\" Clark.  As others above have said, it is MORE than worth the price and is probably the last of the \\"old\\" Leppard sound.  I love this disc because it pays homage to a guitar-man who had a short time on Earth to share his gift of passion and music.      In short, if you LOVE the old Leppard you will MORE than enjoy this everytime you play it.    Rock ON!!!!  R.I.P. Steve, you ARE missed.    :)    Shawn

B00005JPNZ|2.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is unfortunately quite a disappointment. Disappointing to the point of embarrassing for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, the duo have taken a character of extreme popularity and a trilogy of great admiration and added an additional chapter of unnecessary absurdity. During an early scene, our capable hero survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, which is catapulted from the blast zone with deadly force. This momentarily excessive lack of realism is forgivable because he's Indiana Jones. But the rest of the film becomes even more ridiculously farfetched and cannot as easily be brushed aside. Indiana Jones is no longer a man of reason, who could be traversing the world right now hunting for lost treasures. He is complete fiction.<br /><br />It is 1957, and Professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is once again in the midst of peril, this time at the hands of Russian radicals led by Stalin's Austrian psychic scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). Forcing him to lead them to magnetized remains of some obscure creature in a government warehouse, Indy manages to escape to the safe-haven of a nuclear blast testing zone. Shortly thereafter, he is returned to the comfort of his classroom, to teach the seemingly boring topic of archeology.<br /><br />Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) catches up with the legendary adventurer to inform him that a colleague, professor Oxley (John Hurt), has been captured by Spalko, and is being pressured to lead the Soviets to the location of El Dorado, the city of gold, where a crystal skull has been stolen. The legend places the city in the Amazon, and claims to grant the retriever of the artifact unimaginable powers. Soon enough, Jones travels across the globe to South America to play a vital role in fulfilling the legend, and making sure to encounter every danger and every adventure imaginable along the way.<br /><br />Kingdom of the Crystal Skull makes countless references and pays nonstop homage to the original Indiana Jones trilogy, and even brings back familiar characters such as Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Indiana can still take a beating (more than any of the previous films), creepy crawling bugs frequently inhabit his locales, tons of comedy relief peppers the nonstop action sequences, and riddles, puzzles and buried treasure abound. Yet for all of its attempts to make this fourth outing a faithful addition to the already resolute Indy saga, too much of it is unfamiliar. Indy is older and noticeably more weathered, but what feels the most inconsistent is his ability to continually achieve more and more outrageous feats. While most of the action scenes are standard high-speed pursuits, his endeavors to brave raging waterfalls, nuclear blasts, and armies of ants, (plus an even more far-fetched conclusion) just doesn't feel like the flesh and blood Indy we grew accustomed to in the original trilogy.<br /><br />Everyone's favorite archaeological adventurer has tackled everything from the Nazis and their steel beasts to booby-trap-filled temples of doom and lost arks of unimaginable power; so what's left for him to do? Unfortunately the creative minds behind Dr. Jones's escapades seem to have run out of ideas and reverted to both the ridiculously unbelievable and to creations extremely alien to Indy's regiment of religious history. The Russians have replaced the Nazis, the outlandish has replaced the reasonable, and the extraterrestrials have replaced Jesus.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinse original Indiana Jones trilogy, and even brings back familiar characters such as Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Some might make the arguement that early on, Donna Summer was a producers  muse and a voice for Girgio Moroder (as well as co-wrtier/co-producer Pete Belotte) to use in order to release eclectic and sometimes electronic based music.  Prehaps that was true in the very beginning but overtime, as a co-writer and powerful vocalist, Donna certainly put a very feminine and personal stamp on all of her albums, starting most strikingly with \\"Four Seasons Of Love\\" and continuing on to the blockbuster \\"Bad Girls\\" and until their last release  as a team misunderstood (excluding \\"I'm A Rainbow\\") but brilliant new wave effort \\"The Wanderer\\".      Now, in 2008, Donna once again finds the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own singer-songwriter on \\"Crayons\\".  It is hard not to take notice of the producers (and co-writers) here since more often than not, they seem to make their impression known on the tracks.  The best at just making strong pop songs with Donna, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois.  \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is a positive upbeat pop track with good hooks and is a perfect place for Donna's voice to belt out.  It's anthem like feel never feels phony, either.  She is really rooting for you!  Nor does Donna's strange \\"accent\\" on \\"Crayons\\" with Ziggy Marley.  This blasting Reagee pop track has a catchy chorus and is very danceable.  Donna and Ziggy Marley make a memorable well paced piece of music that blasts with positivity and a strong message about working toward \\"one love\\" and letting the \\"crayons\\" melt into one beautiful color.  The Brazilian pop of \\"Drivin' Down Brazil\\", with its fun story, is strong as well.  It has a nice feel of the Jobim songs she references.       Not such a dream team is JR Rotem (with co-writing help from Evan Borgrat....Yep, the son of Neil Bograt, who used to be the head of Donna's seventies label, Casablanca).  \\"Mr. Music\\" is a very simple upbeat pop song and does have a memorable chorus thatwould suit TV commercials...but it suffers from dull hip-hop beats and is dragged down by it's simplicity and silliness and in the moment product placement (\\"Got My Ipod/Shake My Body\\").  Donna doesn't quite rap on \\"The Queen Is Back', but it's a strange boost track (that starts in third person narration talking about \\"she\\" and switches to first without explination) that once again is dragged down  by dull big beats and sound effects.  They are not terrible songs but feel like an attempt to be modern yet sound very dated and childish.  It's not like she is trying to be Britney, even...it's more like trying to be safe and Disney!    Sebastian Arocha Morton is the mastermind along with Al Kasha as a songwriter behind \\"I'm A Fire\\", which is Donna's sweet spot, comfort zone, whatever. It's what you want and expect from someone who stopped making albums but continued to crank out strong club singles (including remixes of pop ballads like the Pokemon based \\"Power Of One\\"...or an upbeat makeover on the Luther original of a similar title, \\"Power Of Love\\").  A chanting, catchy almost minimalist dance track that allows the \\"queen\\" to be a force of nature.  Here, we believe in her over the top claim and she truly is a fire.  It's worth looking for the import or the exclusive edition (sold at another...the initials are CC) to find the similar sounding track \\"It's Only Love\\" (by the same team).  It's not as well structured as a song and sort of just floats as a free form poem that just rants yet it's a beautiful trip!  It's Donna that is probably the reason for the differences in the tracks; the music is very similar, so it is the songwriting and performance that makes them very unique.  Even though \\"I'm A Fire\\" only takes up one track, you can understand her reasoning for not making a full album like this.    Toby Gad is a good contributor, too.  \\"Fame (The Game)\\" combines rock licks and stomping dance beats for a song that describes the quest for fame but unlike songs by young starlets, it's not whinning but wise and introspective (talking about the movies that portrayed beauty queens like Marylin).  \\"Science of Love\\" has a bit of a rock feel, too.  It's a very well paced pop track that really understands good songwriting and Donna's vocals are impressive here as she travels through melody of the track.  Tony Gad also produces to the light pop ballad \\"Sand On My Feet\\".  This track flows and is romantic (the only song from the set were get a love song form the First Lady Of Love).  It has some slightly akward lyrics, though.    Nathan DiGreise, a producer/co-writer from Donna's recent past, brings us the most controversial track.  \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" seems like it would be the basic club stomper but in fact is a funky, rocky blues based character driven piece where Donna tells a story through the created \\"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\\".  It sounds laughable on the surface but much like with \\"Crayons\\" (the title track) and her adopting of a Jamaican (?) accent there, it manages to work.  What Donna lacks in authenticity in the \\"character\\", she makes up with sincerity.  She seems to really get into it and the funky, rollicking vocals of Donna (along with sister Mary Gaines Bernard) have fun with this track.     Also contributing one track is Lester Menedez (producer/co-writer) with Wayne Hector.  It's a simple but hauntingly personal ballad titled \\"Be Myself Again\\", which also centers around fame.  It's a letdown lyrically to her Donna just bemoan fame and talk about how hard it is to be herself again and not the character.  While the lyrics are a bit of a drag, its her voice and how it shifts that sells the song.    Jamie Houston produces/co-writes (with co-writer Fred Kron) the world beat driven gospel infused \\"Bring Down the Reign\\".  This song is not over the top but a subtle song about the terrors in Darfur that works with with drum beats, a children's choir and Donna's combination of strong vocals, spoken word and chanting.  It's a great powerful way to end a CD that has three songs about Donna's issues (good and bad) with being famous and shows a real social conscious.    While there are some questionable moments in songs, every track works in its own way with songs like \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", \\"I'm A Fire\\", \\"Crayons\\" and \\"Science of Love\\" being dance pop classics, \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" is a fun experiment from the usual to even \\"The Queen Is Back\\" as a passable attempt to be modern.  \\"Crayons\\", for an album that tries to be made up of different styles by using different producers, never sounds desperate.  Donna works with fine people but notice there aren't any million dollar names here that could garunatee a hit single.  She clicks with every person in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle the best).  The album altogether is a welcome return not being a queen of the clubs but to making great albums, which is something Donna did for many years, with or without hit results.  Hopefully the public will pick up on \\"Crayons\\" and hear an album by an artist that is often fun, sometimes introspective and compassionate about the outside world that has nothing to do with fame.

0679879269|4.0|The Golden Compass brilliantly invents a fantasy world full of adventure, action and allegorical lessons regarding religion and life. The two sequels smoothly carry on the story line and largely continue to keep the readers absorbed and satisfied, but I cannot say that they are as perfect as the original.<br /><br />While the author successfully introduces new environments and characters through the series to keep it fresh, I cannot help notice that his preaching of liberal values grows more naked as the series progresses. Make no mistake, I am happy that this series exists to serve as a counter-weight to the typical Christian fundamentalist propaganda parading as young adult literature, e.g. Narnia, but I have to admit that some story elements in this final volume push the envelope a little too far and make the book suitable for mature audience only, which is quite regrettable as the first two books have been great for even very young kids. Specifically, the climax of this book involves the protagonist, 13-year-old Lyra, committing \\"the original sin\\" with her boy friend in the woods within the sight of the last surviving bad guy, a zealot priest on a mission to assassinate her. The ex deus machina comes about when the priest is killed just in time by a gay angel sworn to protect the boy. Yes, you read me right. This book features gay angels (as well as horny ones by the way). The author certainly cannot be accused of a lack of imagination.<br /><br />My other complaint regards plausibility. We are talking about a fantasy series here, so I am not trying to apply real physics to the story. It is the motivation and behaviors of some characters that bothers me. For example, the ghosts and harpies talk, interact and respond in ways totally illogical and unrealistic. But they are minor characters non-essential to the core plot, so flipping quickly past these parts is not difficult.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, I still enjoy reading it tremendously. This series is truly one of the best in its genre.
0143038419|2.0|So, you tell me you have to go to 3 countries, find God, meditate, etc. to get over a husband and a lover?  Good Lord.  How little one must think of themself if the \\"pity-party\\" lasts for that very long.  In the course of the book, she tries to tell women to see their inner worth - that we are not solely dependant on a man for happiness.  And, where does she end up?  Right back in the fray - right back where she started from.  On the other hand, there were a few good lines in the book.  A few good insights.  A few good quotes - such as:  \\"Give us this day our Daily Gripe.\\"  She used this to describe how annoyingly negative people are.  On this - and a few other points, I totally agree.  However, as far as Liz and men are concerned - I think she needs a man sort of as a crutch.  Walking strong, proud and free ain't such a bad thing, Liz.  It's just not as hard as you make it.....
1592289444|4.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" is Polish Army officer Slavomir Rawicz's enthralling account of an escape from a Soviet labor camp in Siberia in 1941.  Rawicz claims he and his companions walked south across the rugged interior of Asia to freedom in British India.  Along the way, he and his companions managed to cross the Gobi Desert and the Himalayian Mountains, equipped only with ragged skimpy clothing, a hand axe blade, an improvised knife and a small initial store of food.<br /><br />It is an absolutely gripping read that will make an impression on the reader, a seeming monument to the tenacity of the human spirit.  It is so incredible that, well, the rather bare bones story might just be too good to be true.  The survival of the small group in the face of so many obstacles does strain credibility, and there is some outside evidence that the story as presented is not entirely factual.  Readers will have to make their judgement on the matter, but they are more than welcome to enjoy the read.  Cautiously recommended.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|God knows that this woman cannot sing, but this album is definitely enjoyable and worth picking up.  Britney Spears has been in the media a lot lately, so I wanted to see where her creative mind was, so I decided to take a listen to \\"Blackout\\" since it was released right in the thick of all the drama.  What helped me get past her sub-par singing voice and bad delivery was the infectious and experimental production found on this album.  These beats are very fresh; the provide listeners with a new and fresh sound.  Lyrically, she addresses many of the negative issues which surround her such as her failed marriage, parenting skills and a slew of other interesting topics.<br /><br /> \\"Gimme More\\" begins this album nicely.  I remember the first time I heard this song and I was really impressed with it, namely the hook, beat and the fact that she began it with the unforgettable quote, \\"It's Britney b*tch!\\"  \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Radar\\" and \\"Perfect Lover\\" are up-tempo highlights, too. As with every song she has ever recorded, her delivery is alright, but she needs to give a lot more vocally because that little whisper-singing she does is not working.  Christina Aguilera is a pop artist too, but she sings.  But, maybe Britney gives all she HAS.  \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" definitely has that Neptunes sound.  They did a very nice job with this song.  Britney addresses the issues surrounding she and Kevin Federline on this song.  She's pretty open with what she says.  This is easily one of the best songs on \\"Blackout.\\"  Thank goodness she has a ballad here because most of the tracks are fast.<br /><br /> This album will be in my CD player for a while.  But, I don't want to be stingy.  I would like to recommend this album to those who are taken in by great beats, dance numbers and an album that is not too long and not too short (it's 43.6 minutes long.)<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Gimme More\\"<br />2. \\"Toy Soldier\\"<br />3. \\"Perfect Lover\\"<br />4. \\"Why Should I Be Mad\\"<br />5. \\"Radar\\"
0743487583|1.0|One word. \\"Endeavor\\"<br /><br />This word was used ATLEAST 4 times a page on every page of the book when Victor is talking.<br /><br />By the last half of the book, I was so fed up with her lack of vocabulary that I just could not stand to read it anymore.<br /><br />Horribly written. Decent plot, though. I will give her that.
B0016B6ZKG|2.0|Musically (I'm talking melody, voice leading and chord progression here, actual tonality and harmony) this is a repetative sounding effort - lots of minor chords and sparse progressions that leave one waiting for a hook or chorus that never appears. No anthems of Paul Jabara or Jimmy Webb calibre here - which may point more towards the state of modern pop music than Donna's abilities (this is the lady that gave us the exquisite \\"Dim All The Lights\\"). Nothing to turn up loud and sing along with in the car. These songs are more of a forgetable Janet Jackson-esque style. It seems the modern crowd depends on drugs to fill the dance floor, not hit tunes. Remember how the floor would fill (and still does) when the Village People's \\"YMCA\\" starts up? Few tracks use actual acoustic instruments - when she tours this summer, she'll need a synth bank and a drum machine, not an orchestra. Donna has the proven ability to inspire awe in a listener, all too rare these days and sorely needed. Joy, which is a Donna trademark, and the reason the lady is a star, should be in a major key, as any child taking piano knows that minor \\"sounds sad\\". Memorable cuts include \\"Sand On My Feet\\" and \\"The Queen Is Back\\", which itself should have opened the album and reminds the listener of Bette Midler's \\"I'm Beautiful (Damn It!)\\". All in all, a disappointment. This release makes \\"Cats Without Claws\\" and \\"Mistaken Identity\\" sound good. I wasn't hoping for a repeat of the past, but I was hoping for my Donna Summer \\"Fairytale High\\", which I've gone so long without and I'm still waiting for...
B000VR824S|5.0|This is really good stuff for any fan of guitar wizardry at its finest. Multiple genres are well represented, the sound is great, camera work awesome, & Eric Clapton does not steal the show.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Following 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor is not an easy task.  Much like Ray of Light before it, Confessions was one of those landmark albums that seemed to really gain strong positive reaction from fans.   But Madonna certainly delivers on Hard Candy.  Any apprehension I may have had that this would be way too urban or hip hop was soon dismissed once I listened to this for the first time.  In fact, despite what some reviewers are saying (which only proves they did not even listen to this cd before reviewing it) Hard Candy is far more a pop/dance album with some funky/hip hop influences than a full on r+B/hip hop record.      Madonna has always been about reinvention.  She could've easily gone back into the studio again with Stuart Price to create another euro-disco/electronic dance album but Madonna is never one to repeat herself.  So why would you expect her to do so now?  Her choice to work with well-known producers does not take away from this album's appeal.  Madonna has always been about tapping into influences from music, culture and fashion and adding her own unique style to it.  Here she again has created another great album that is influenced by the people she has chosen to collaborate with but her own style is present and front and center as always.      My song for song review:    1. Candy Shop (great opening track which sets the mood for the record.  This song got alot of flack from fans when it was leaked in 2007.  I can not understand why because i love this.   It's funky, urban, but still danceable all at the same time.   Madonna pleas for us to \\"get up on the dancefloor\\" and it is obvious that she has not forgotten the place that she started from and that is the dance clubs. )   2. 4 minutes (the hit single featuring Justin timberlake and Timbaland.  Solid production with great horns and a thumping urban/dance beat.  Although this song is solid it is definitely not indicative of what the rest of the album sounds like.  The most hip-hip influenced song here and dispite being a good track probably one of the weaker songs here. )  3. Give It 2 Me (classic Madonna dance/pop track! Great lyrics, thumping dance beat and a funky breakdown in the middle before jumping back into the dance beat again.   Anyone who is a fan of Madonna's  more recent dance/electronic songs with Mirwais and Stuart Price will love this gem.  Great choice for the second single.)  4. Heartbeat (another great dance/pop track.   Funky drums with an 80's inspired electro/synth melody running throughout.  Madonna's vocals are bright and sweet which reminds me slightly of her 80's era hits Into The Groove and Angel.Would make a great single)  5. Miles Away (great mid-tempo ballad with strong lyrics and melody, acoustic guitar and one of Madonna's strongest vocals since Evita/Ray of Light era.  This song wouldn't sound out of place among ballads like I Deserve It and The Power of Goodbye although it is backed with Timbaland's signature drums.  But the beat never overpowers Madonna's performance or melody.  Proof that Madonna does greatly influence whichever producer she collaborates with. Definitely has hit single potential)  6. She's Not Me (Another great dance gem that wouldn't sound out of place on Confessions on a Dance Floor.  This disco-funk track reminds me of the sound of 70's disco-era group Chic's hit \\"Good Times\\".  A great track with great lyrics and bass guitar. This has the making of a huge dance/club hit)  7. Incredible (Great track influenced by 80's era electro/dance.  I love the beat and the way to song ends althogh it is a bit long.)  8.  Beat Goes On (Another disco-funk gem featuring Kanye West.   With it's infectious dance groove and chorus this track is definitely hit single potential.)  9. Dance 2Night (This 80's inspired dance track reminds me of Madonna's early club hits like Physical Attraction.  Great production from Timbaland. )   10. Spanish Lesson (another song that has gotten some flack from fans.  Granted the lyrics are silly but the production is great and Madonna's vocals are sweet.  This reminds me of a new millenium take on Who's That Girl or La Isla Bonita, except more danceable.)  11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You (Another stand-out track.  This mid-tempo, atmospheric ballad has a dark, haunting feel to it.  Wonderful lyrics and melody and another great vocal from Madonna.  With it's slight trip-hop vibe this reminds me of a more modernized version of some of her Ray of Light era ballads.)  12. Voices (Another great track with a haunting melody, interesting lyrics with a thumping bassline underneath it.   A great way to close the album.)      Definitely another great Madonna album.  It hasn't left my car stereo since i bought it three weeks ago.
0743297334|5.0|I think Hemingway attacked the theme of insecurity because, he was also dealing with his own issues.   Hemingway had a history of alcoholism and this novel serves as release for the author. The speaker, Jake, takes an adventure and in turn experiences a self-discovery. The fiestas, society, and friends meant everything for Jake at the novel's opening. However through a difficult journey dealing with lost love and false friends, Jake manages to realize several truths in his life: his drinking will lose him friends and those he calls friends are not true in their loyalty.    Montoya, the hotel owner that shared Jake's passion for bullfighting, no longer wished to associate with Jake after the fiesta. Due to all the rabble-rousing, partying, drinking, and the friends Jake brought, Montoya no longer could bear to be associated with Jake. Hemingway, too, lost friends as a result of his hurtful drinking habits.    Despite his losses, Jake realizes that his love for Brett is merely and allusion. The novel ends:  \\"'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, 'we could have had such a damned good time together.'... 'Yes,' I said. 'Isn't it pretty to think so?'\\"  Jake has come to terms with the fact that he is to be a loner, that he needs to be alone.    The Sun Also Rises is considered not only one of Ernest Hemingway's best books, but also one of the greatest classics of modern literature. I believe that the book is so powerful to read because the author underwent a catharsis in writing the novel. In writing the novel, Hemingway attacks his alcoholism and takes the first steps towards dealing with it. It is from that natural process that the reader is able to feel the emotions in the book. The language is curt yet true. The book is great.
0307387178|5.0|First off, my rating is for this book, not a referendum on Chris McCandless's life and death. This book succeeds on many levels and is driven by the author's affinity for his subject. This is foremost expert detective work, solving the mystery of exactly what happened to Chris. Next, this is a psychological study of a unique individual, and Krakauer also presents parallels with similar people including some of his own experience. Maybe the most important point the author conveys is that nothing about Chris's tragedy is as simple or transparent as it appears. Many reviewers dismiss Chris as naive and ignorant, but Krakauer disproves this notion several times over. A good example is the wild potato seed/mold incident at the end of the story.<br /><br />You will not forget Chris McCandless or this book. I would have enjoyed it had this only been a straightforward telling of the facts, but Krakauer's treatment of this story makes this book truly compelling. In response to many critics, Chris is not heroic but misunderstood. He clearly made several missteps and was \\"over his head,\\" but was never suicidal.The author details many experiences in Chris's background during the 2 years prior to his death which gave him overconfidence in his abilities. His tragic mistake with the mold on potato seeds took his life.<br /><br />Chris had a passion for solitude yet was unforgettable to anyone who ever met him. Krakauer offers tremendous insight into the meaning of Chris's life and the cataclysm that was his death. All readers won't agree with the author's handling of Chris, but to paraphrase him: a dispassionate rendering of this tragedy is impossible.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|MGMT has garnered a lot of music press hype over the past year, leading up to the release of their major label debut, \\"Oracular Spectacular\\".  The knee-jerk reaction to all of this publicity would be to label this duo as Critics' Flavor of The Month and then quickly discard them.  However, the album succeeds as very listenable album that upbeat, quirky and oftentimes a lot of fun as well.      This Brooklyn duo grabs their influence from the entire alt-hipster spectrum.  The psychedelia of The Flaming Lips (courtesy of producer Dave Fridmann), the wink-wink humor of Ween, the full arrangements of recent Radiohead, electronic production elements reminiscent of Portishead and Gary Numan, funky beats worthy of OutKast and Prince, melodies straight from The Beatles and Bowie.  Vocals are thin and spindly, often relying on a faux-Prince falsetto as in the current single \\"Electric Feel\\", sometimes trying for a measured rock energy a la T. Rex.      Whew - that's a lot of ingredients in this mix, eh?  Yes, it is.  And unfortunately, after several tracks, the line starts to blur between the result being inspired and just plain contrived.  There's nothing really new occurring here in the reassembly of the source material.  Again, not to say that the end result isn't thoroughly catchy and generally enjoyable, but will it be a must-listen material for years to come?  Probably not.
B000TGJ80I|2.0|So I vaguely remembered seeing Underworld, possibly even in the theaters when it first came out, yet didn't quite recall my final judgement of the film. Then came the glorious Blu-Ray release of the film, well HD viewers, don't waste your time or money. The film itself comes out still appearing too grainy in spots while in others is too dark. I remembered this about my original viewing of the movie and I will say that the HD quality improved it slightly. Foremost in my mind is the overall terrible movie that this is. Bad acting, bad scripting and convoluted plot don't help matters at all. Overall just skip this movie, it will not stand the test of time.
B000244EMO|5.0|This movie is way cool AND the special features included in this set are actually worth watching. The \\"making of's\\" are pretty interesting.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Despite a few stutters by the writers on racial and gender issues, Supernatural's third season follows the show's established tradition of cranking the intensity a notch higher than in the previous season. The crew, as always, have outdone themselves in set design and dressing, locations, props, and camera technique. Lighting, which began the season as the network wanted, brighter and more colorful, was found to be less effective. By mid-season it returns to the familiar moody noir-ish look that provides shadow and mystery to things we never completely see, and is something of a signature look for the show. The effects departments, both physical and digital, are up to their usual standards, always bringing the viewer movie-quality visuals. Veteran directors Phil Scriggia, Robert Singer, and Kim Manners bring their unique styles, perspectives, and knowledge of the world the characters inhabit to their episodes.    The actors surpass their performances in previous seasons. Ackles, always a gifted physical actor, delivers some of the best facial acting anywhere on film today. And Padalecki, after years as a dependable male ingenue, has matured into his craft. Physically imposing, he uses his body as an instrument, drawing in to present Sam as self-effacing and non-threatening or, where it's called for, using his height and impressive wingspan to intimidate and dominate. His facial acting has refined with maturity as well, to the point where he can hold the screen with his costar. The emotional reaches these two young actors take their characters are deeply affecting for the viewer, breathing life into characters on a page.    The themes the series returns to time and again, family, alienation, rescue, surviving in a hostile world, helping the less fortunate, are solid themes whether set in medieval Italy, on a planet in a distant star system, or in an urban sitcom. The background of ordinary, uniquely American life overlaid on an unsuspected realm of myth, legend, andtheology is merely the setting for these themes to develop and unspool. This crew of writers, technicians, craftspeople, directors and actors is able to establish and invite the viewer into this created reality. It's an invitation worth taking.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I've been a card carrying fan of Donna Summer since 1975 and really happy that she was able to release a new CD after all these years.  We've been teased every few years or so with a dance song here and there, and or a track or two that has appeared on someone elses CD project, but this really will feed true Summer fans both new and old. CRAYONS is very colorful, and allows the listener to experience a variety of beats, vocals and themes.  Most know that Donna has always had a POWERFUL VOICE, so to me hearing it used in different ways is okay.  If some of the songs are remixed, they should include accapella versions and allow us to hear her belt out the words without some of the extra do-dad stuff that a previous reviewer was put off by.  Since I realize that she doesn't need all the electronic stuff, it doesn't bother me to hear it.  It allows her to hit that current market, and that isn't a bad thing. I'm just glad to hear her new songs on the internet/radio and see her back on TV, having a good time.  From Disco Queen, to the Diva of Dance, to Musical Empress.  Do your thang Donna!  Much love always.
0060989157|5.0|I have never enjoyed reading a book as much as I did The Dirt. I am not suggesting it is the best book I have ever read but it is the most entertaining.
0765342294|5.0|If you are someone that refuses to read books, or thinks that books are a waste of time, I challenge you to be able to put down this book.  From the very inception of its first page the reader dives into a world of fantasy and excitement.  Orson Scott Card creates a world that we all feel an affinity for and characters we all can relate to on some level.  For the science fiction buff, this book is a wonderful and riveting read.  For people that could care less about \\"aliens and spaceships,\\" this book brings to life the scenarios and events that abound in it, making even the most stubborn person a true believer in the power of creative writing.  Orson Scott Card magnificently delivers this book with politics, war, creatures, and a cast of characters that rivals any other book in this genre.
B000001GS2|5.0|I bought this recording relying on the fact that there is not a single bad performance in DG's 'Originals' series and I was not let down. I was fortunate enough to be able to listen to the disc all in one sitting, and when the piece was finished I could do nothing but sit there in awe. I strongly reccomend this recording of Pagliacci. The sound is great, the performances are moving, and the overall effect is absolutely overwhelming!
1416905014|3.0|This book by Matthew Reinhart not in collaboration with Robert Sabuda leaves a little (a very little) to be desired. The illustrations are nice, but not as eye-poppingly beautiful as a book about Cinderella could be and the quality of the pop-ups are not as crisp as those in the books in which the Sabuda/Reinhart duo collaborated. There are several pages which do not close properly and the pop-ups needs to be manually adjusted before closing the book or the pop-ups will be squished. I have not found this problem in any book in which Sabuda has a hand. It could be just my copy. I'm just saying....
B000FCKC4C|5.0|My brother had introduced the book to me two years ago but I could not start the book for reason I cannot remember now. So when I requested the book from him recently, I was disappointed to learn that it was not his book, and he had already returned to his friend. Instead, I borrowed another of his Paulo Coelho's book Veronica Wants To Die. I enjoyed the book and decided this is a writer that I can read now.<br /><br />I finished the book in two days. I was stunned to learn that The Alchemist is basically saying the same thing as The Secret and The Law of Attraction, that is \\"when you want something, all the universe conspires to help you acheive it.

He defied fate to become a shepard boy because he wanted to travel and see the country when he was meant to be a priest all along. Disappointed, his father neverthless gave him three gold coins he had found in his fields and his blessing,  for that was his father's now buried dream too.<br /><br />In his travel with his sheep, he met a King of Salem, who told him he needed to look for his Personal Legend. 'A Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. But as time passes, he is convinced that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.' The King told Santiago that his Personal Lengend is to travel to the Pyramids in Egypt to find a treasure. Since Santiago already wants to travel, he sees no harm in going further than what he had planned before. So he sold his sheep to fund his travel to Egypt, which was across the straits.<br /><br />Along the way, he met many people, some kind, some conned him of all his money, and some wanted his life. In his despair from his losses, he remembered the King's advice not to stop dreaming, as the Universe is helping him acheive it.<br /><br />During his treacherous journey across the desert when he was worried about being killed in the cross fire of the tribal war, a wise camel driver related to Santiago that \\"because I don't live in either the past or future, I am interested only in the present.

0743564413|4.0|This is one of the great books of the Twentieth Century, but the at times disappointing reading by Hurt causes me to deduct one star.     Hurt is too intrusive as a reader.  He hams up the part of Michael Campbell with a thick and drunken Scottish accent.  His reading makes a likeable character like Jake's buddy Bill seem like an oaf. His impression of Lady Ashley leaves one wondering why Jake or anyone else would even bother with her. Actors, of course, are supposed to interpret the work, but a lighter hand is necessary when reading a book as opposed to acting out a play.  Moreover, Hurt's interpretation is unjustifiably negative.  Yes, Hemingway is writing about the post-World-War-I \\"Lost Generation\\" and, yes, Jake hangs with a bunch of alcoholic wretches, but Hurt's interpretation is a bit too cartoon-like.  There is more subtlety to these characters than Hurt is willing to acknowledge.     As for Hemingway's book, it's worth reading and re-reading.  And this audiobook has allowed me to re-read the book easily at a later stage in life.  In some ways the book does not age well.  Robert Cohn is a central character, and the rank anti-semitism of the author as well as his characters is inexcusable.  Cohn's \\"Jewishness\\" is totally gratuitous.  Hemingway could have sketched this character without this cheap and mean-spirited use of the easy prejudices that so pervaded his time.  Yes, we have to give Hemingway some slack and not judge him by modern standards; but not everyone was an anti-semite back then and a better man would have overcome this social prejudice.    On the other hand, the book is extraordinary for the muscularity of its prose.  The story is told largely through dialogue and spare descriptions.  It is a riveting style that draws the reader into the book and requires the reader to make many of the essential judgments about the various characters.      I can't agree with those reviewers who are left unmoved by the story.  The story is quite interesting andfast moving.  And it touches on the elemental themes of how to define a moral code in a lost world.  Also striking is Hemingway's struggle with how to define masculinity in such a world.  Jake seems to strike the best balance between assertiveness and empathy, but lacks the physical abilities.  Cohn has the physical gifts but none of the emotional ones.  The other characters seem to suffer from various self-destructive impulses, which seems to be a common outlet for the the masculine impulse.  Perhaps the best masculine role model is the bullfighter, Romero, but there are hints that even he is prone to corruption and self-destructiveness.    I recommend the book, but see if there is an older, better reading somewhere.
B000MQPU7U|5.0|A gem of a film, made in 1975, directed by Sydney Pollack. Robert Mitchum is superb as a retired PI going back to Japan in post WWII. Mitchum and his buddy who he is doing a favor for (Brian Keith) were MP's in Japan during the post-war occupation. When an arms deal with a Japanese syndicate boss goes awry, Brian Keith's daughter is kidnapped and Mitchum goes to see if he can find her. He enlists the help of the brother of his ex-love. The plot is thick, the action intense in this superb film. It is full of conflict between East and West culture but the intrigue never slacks off and builds up to an amazing conclusion. One twist after another builds up the suspense with some jaw dropping revelations and great action. Highly recommended. Takakura Ken is superb.
1401216676|2.0|I am not a die-hard Batman comic book fan. I grew up on the post-Frank Miller live action movies and animated series. Before \\"The Killing Joke\\" my exposure to Batman comics was decidedly limited. I say this to show that I'm not one of those people who say: \\"A Batman comic? This is AWESOME!!\\" I have no loyalties and I'm not a hater. If it's good, it's good. If it's not, it's not.<br /><br />1st, the car. The Batmobile is what we all want to drive. Forget Kit from Knight Rider. THIS is the car! Killing Joke's batmobile... was the ugliest POS incarnation of the Batmobile I have ever seen. Like I said, I don't know if this was Brian Bolland's (artist) continuation of someone else's design or an original, so not sure who to blame. It has what looks like a giant fox on the front of a car that looks like a modified version of one of those old '50s cars with the giant bulges around the wheels, a giant tailwing sticking about 8 feet into the air, and with Batman sitting in a large George Jetson bubble behind a long cylindrical hood. Had to mention. Just couldn't get over it. Worse, much worse, than George Clooney's neon open top from Batman & Robin.<br /><br />Now the story. It just didn't do anything for me. It was emotionless, uncompelling. My previous Batman readings literally kept the page turning. Sometimes I didn't have time to admire the art because I wanted to see what happens next. Forcing myself to put it down because I've been reading for too long, then not being able to wait to get back to it. THE reason to buy this book is the transformation of one of the pivotal characters of the Batman universe: Barbara Gordon, commisioner Gordon's daughter and Batgirl, being senselessly shot by a heartless Joker and paralyzed for life. This pivotal moment occurs within the first few pages and with little emphasis, as if it was the requisite opening mugging of a nameless citizen of Gotham, rather than the climax it should have been.<br /><br />This story also includes a detailed origins story for The Joker. As others have said, what makes The Joker so scary is that we don't know anything about him. We don't know what made him the way he is or why he does the sick things he does. Alan Moore's creation is mundane and questionable. Barring the obvious disfigurement, most people who would have undergone Moore's explanation might have gotten a little bummed, had a drink, and called it a day, not go inordinately psychotic and committing to a life of crime.<br /><br />And those two details aside, it simply didn't move me. It was unemotional, undramatic, and bordered on boring. There's a bonus short story included, written and illustrated by the artist, Brian Bolland, that was, though short and unavoidably simplistic, far more dramatic and interesting then The Killing Joke, which just shows how much of a failure the main story was.<br /><br />Lastly, character. The story opens with Batman making a trip to Arkham Asylum: He rolls up and parks out front. Batman wouldn't do that. He walks through the front door. Batman wouldn't do that. He gets directions from the receptionist. Batman wouldn't do that. He talks face to face with \\"The Joker\\" for five minutes before the \\"detective\\" realizes it's not even really him. Batman wouldn't.... And later, the murderous Joker -who just shot and paralyzed Batgirl and kidnapped and tortured Commisioner Gordon- tells a joke, and the brooding Dark Knight laughs. Batman wouldn't do that!! And the whole flashback of the joker and his life before crime is lame, tired, and at this point, pathetic.<br /><br />The short 60 or so pages and the disproportionate price is just not worth it.<br /><br />I have recently moved on to works by Jeph Loeb (writer) and Tim Sale (artist) that I highly recommend as far trumping the Moore-Bolland work. Although plot and character will do that.<br /><br />I don't mean to come off so strong and verging on sounding like an *ss. The Killing Joke is a decent read.  Like I said, mediocre, but grade A mediocre. It passes the time, the artwork -outside of the awful Batmobile- is pretty good, the opening and closing panels were very nicely done, and the story is pretty okay. The Killing Joke is not garbage, but definitely not a masterpiece. With the ambitious origin telling, and life-changing injuries of a pivotal character, it just could have been so much more.the awful Batmobile- is pretty good, the opening and closing panels were very nicely done, and the story is pretty okay.

B00005JPNZ|1.0|I am huge fan of the Indiana Jones trilogy. So, naturally, when I found out that they were making another one I was hyped. Well come to find out, bad things come when making a movie nearly 20 years after the original films. This is one of those films. If you agree with this paragraph so far then read onward. If not, then I advise you to ignore it.<br /><br />WARNING-CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />First off, the whole \\"Indiana Jones\\" feel just wasn't there at all. From the very start you're delved into a confusing plot involving I'm guessing some form of military and they're after the Crystal Skull. I believe that they go to Area 51 or whatnot. Which reminds me of something else. The script was not well written and a bit cheesy and there seemed to be plot holes throughout the movie.<br /><br />I know that Harrison Ford is older but he is still the same guy with the same mind. I felt like his character was a bit altered. If anyone understands what kind of guy Jones is they'll know that he makes certain and sometimes funny facial expressions, especially in Temple of Doom, and cracks some pretty good jokes in serious situations. In the Crystal Skull I didn't really get that from him. I know he's older but I did feel like his character was changed a bit.<br /><br />Now here is the most disappointing of anything that I have to say and I must say that I think it was a huge mistake to put this in the movie. The whole riddle of the Mayan ruins in the Crystal Skull ends up being about aliens. That's right. Aliens. Aliens in an Indiana Jones movie. How the heck do you put something like aliens in an Indiana Jones movie? The movie lost me there. I hated it then.<br /><br />The feel was gone. I wish that movies today were like how they were with the original Indiana Jones movies. NO special effects and the whole melting thing in Raiders of the Lost Ark was cheesy I'll admit but it also added a bit of comedy to creepy scene.<br /><br />Well, come to find out, Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark, is in it and apparently she had a child with Indiana but she never told him and so this kid named Mut, played by Shia Lebouf, is his kid. And then at the end Indiana and Marion get married, which was an extremely lame scene. Indiana was a bit of a player if you know what I mean. You can clearly see that in all three movies.<br /><br />All of the movies had their main plots. In the first it was all about the Ark. At the end we see a supernatural movement and it's figured that it was God since the Ark was messed with. In the second they are in India and have to return a village's stones back there and save all the children so that they can return to the village. In that movie Indy, Shorty, and Willy come across basically a cult which involves making Indy one of them and pulling out hearts of people. A bit far fetched but REALISTIC. In the final, The Last Crusade, they find the Holy Grail, which is a popular subject. King Arthur and his knights searched for it. It's a popular story. People sought it to have eternal life, drinking from the cup of Christ. This one is also realistic but it's because of the way that they DID it.<br /><br />The Crystal Skull did not have the same feel at all. And it's because it was made 20 years after the originals, they used special effects, the script was horrible and cheesy, the film didn't look like the ones in the 80's, the characters were altered a bit, and they put SCI FI into it. Not a good combination. To all the Indiana Jones fans, I strongly advise you to NOT see this movie. I know that many will see it anyway and I don't blame you at all. Just know that if you're a huge fan you will be VERY disappointed and it will be scarred on your brain!<br /><br />So, with that said, either ignore or agree this review. It's just an opinion so no one has to agree. I had to pop in the Temple of Doom when I got home so I'll continue watching it now, along with trying to forget the horrible movie. As far as I'm concerned it never happened. Good day to you all. =)

0486424545|5.0|This brilliant classic of English literature features the clash of the artistic and social Schlegel sisters--Margaret and Helen--with the business oriented and pragmatic Wilcox men--Henry and his sons Charles and Paul.  All are wealthy.  This is a novel of comfortable upper-class Edwardian life set in London and rural England.      Although written in 1910, Howards End is amazingly contemporary and relevant.  Of course, the conflict between the personal and the practical, the artistic and the commercial is ever-present.  Also Forster touches cleverly on many other societal issues that are current.  We read about the motor car just beginning its dynasty in 1910; indeed the automobile is almost another character in the novel--mute and ominous.  There are also insightful passages about pollution and environmental issues, urban sprawl, and a wonderful discussion of the commercialization of Christmas, among many other fascinating discussions some shallow others deep.  I was particularly interested in Forster's exploration of the practical and commercial as the necessary underpinning of the artistic and personal.  At one point Margaret says that money is the \\"warp of life,\\" a metaphor based on the warp and woof of the weaver's cloth (a clever pun also).      One aspect of reading Howards End that I felt continually, but seems not to have been mentioned by other reviewers, is the giant tentacles of the ugly octopus of World War I looming darkly over the characters and their futures.  Neither the author in 1910 nor his characters, the half German Schlegel sisters nor the very British Wilcoxes, could know that a great war that would end their peaceful and prosperous Edwardian era was soon to begin.  Throughout the novel the issues of German and English culture are in the background.  The Schlegel sisters met the Wilcoxes in Germany.  The Schlegels often have relatives visiting from Germany, and Helen returns there toward the end of the novel.  Only slight foreboding hints ofa coming disaster are slinking here and there.  At one point just in passing early in the book Forster says that war with Germany is inevitable because the newspapers say it is.  The war was a result of the commercial and military competition of Great Britain and Germany which was already anxious and worrisome in 1910, although no one could anticipate what a monumental crisis it would provoke.  Almost twenty percent of all upper-class British males were killed in action in the war--over 40 million casualties total for all combatants in World War I.    Howards End is just as readable and fascinating now as it must have been in 1910, and it was a popular success.  I do not believe, however, that it would have even been conceivable just five years later.  So much had changed by 1915.  World War I--1914-1918--was roiling the entire civilization of Europe.  The old ways were dissolving on the battlefields France and Belgium.  The easy intercourse of the Schegels with Germany and their German relatives would be impossible.  Indeed the Schegel sisters themselves would be suspect and isolated in England.  (Perhaps though they would find their fulfilment as volunteer military nurses as many Germans living in England did.)  Paul and Charles would be in the trenches at Ypres if they were still alive, not in business in London or strutting about the colonial empire.  Everything would change so fast so soon.  As I read this novel I felt every moment the monumental disasters stalking the Schegels and Wilcoxes and their world, disasters that would make their current personal trials seem rather puny.  For me this gave the novel an extra frisson of tension and awe.

B00003CXC7|5.0|I think that this is one of Hitchcock's most popular and entertaining films.  I truly adore Jimmy Stewart, and his work with Hitchcock is just magical (Rope, Vertigo, and the Man Who Knew Too Much).  Grace Kelly IS the Hitchcock blonde.  Their dysfunctional relationship is believable and well acted.  Thelma Ritter stands out, even among these two, to be a transcendent comic character.<br /><br />The story itself is still so intriguing: a voyeur witnesses a crime, but has trouble convincing others because he is prying on his unsuspecting neighbors.  I think reality t.v. proves just how much interest we all have in the lives of others.  The timeless storyline is so well acted and cleverly presented; it is difficult NOT to like this film.<br /><br />The DVD is quality, but it is obvious that the extensive reconstruction work used on Vertigo is not present here.  All the extras make it a must have.  For Hitchcock fans it is a must.  So indulge your voyeuristic curiosities ... Highly recommended.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|You people cant handle a shaky cam? Oh you might get a headache? .. now take your Gummy Bear aspirin and go take a nap!   I loved this movie!  But \\"Cloverfield\\" is not perfect; for one the monster is a little video game boss like (but done extremely well) and why oh why is HUD filming his POV of a life or death disaster? He must be a moron! (actually the script doesn't make him smart in the least, so the makers tried to say \\"Hey he never dropped the cam to run for his life cuz he really is a moron!\\") Well SORRY even a moron would drop the camera to run for his life! So there is a problem there. The makers should have devised a helmet cam device that is somehow written into the plot, but even that sounds gimmicky.     Also, maybe it's technically possible to run a cam's battery for the length of this movie, but this cam ain't filming a T-ball game. It gets dropped numerous times, never appears to even run low on battery life AND the tape itself (or hard drive) survives (spoiler alert ) a nuclear bomb? Amazing! What brand of camera is that? Cuz I want one!    But the plot-dilemma's of the cam doesn't ruin the spirit of fun and horror this movie provides. I would like a little more humor and a tad better acting. But this is fun, different and most important .. entertaining!!
0061547832|5.0|I actually checked this book out at the library and ended up loving it so much I plan to purchase it from Amazaon. I own a small business and am always searching for a new perspective on anything regarding business so I thought I would see what the Donald had to say about it.     I appreciate his direct approach and the book was always entertaining. Yes, he was born into money but the man has guts and has experienced his fair share of low points in his business endeavors. He has a lot of passion for what he does and although his advice is simple, \\"common sense\\" it is still informative- if you are willing to apply your knowledge. It's a book I will refer to often, even if it's just to keep my confidence levels high and build my momentum. I recommend it.
0385340540|3.0|I liked reading the book, but as you get to the last 50-100 pages it seems as though the author was in a rush to get it to his publisher.  The ending was very compacted given the pace of the first 2/3 of the book and could have been greatly expanded upon.  I left feeling as though the author met his quota of pages and wanted get on with the next novel.
B000K6QIQO|3.0|Make no mistake, this is a Russian bootleg.  Not an official release.  Perhaps if Capitol would wake up and see time and opportunity slipping away, they'd release Hey Jude as part of The Capitol Albums Vol. 3 or The Apple Albums.    I bought this CD to get the stereo mix of I Should Have Known Better which is what is included.  But for some unknown reason the bootleggers placed mono mixes of pretty much the rest of the album.  The mono mixes are already available on The Beatles' CD singles releases.  The album was only released in stereo in the U.S.  In fact, several tracks had to be mixed into stereo for the first time for the official release.    The cover is a faithful reproduction of the original.  The music is five stars (come on, it's The Beatles!), but the selection of mixes brings this down to three stars.
B00132D808|5.0|If what you enjoyed most about Panic was their techno fast beats, you will not like this album. The only carry-over element is their level of bizarre, in example: their lyrics. The majority of their lyrics need a Rosetta Stone for translation but after listening to the album, it's understood that its not about the lyrics. Pretty. Odd. has a deeper, more full sound than \\"Fever\\" and overall musicianship is greater. Each track is deliciously layered with harmonies, guitars, and a sweet strings and brass section courtesy of infamous Abbey Road. A great sample track would be track 5, 'That Green Gentleman'. This album transcends their flashy digital past and send listeners into a deliciously happier place. Listen to this album at least three times and go into it with no  pretenses of it sounding like it's predecessor. Forget the punctuation change and welcome the Pretty Amazing, Pretty. Odd.
0307387178|5.0|The power of the human spirit is none more inspiring and striking as it is in Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild. A young man abandons a well-to-do life to find himself through an adventure that concludes in Alaska. Based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, the book is retold from Krakauer as he interviews McCandless's family members, friends and the people he encountered on his journey. Krakauer paints the arresting picture of life that was Christopher McCandless effortlessly.   Originally written by Krakauer as an in-depth article for Outsider magazine, the article was extended and more extensively researched for it's 1996 publication as a nonfiction book.    Shortly after graduating Emory University, McCandless set off. He burned the dollar bills in his wallet, donated his $25,000 worth of savings to OXFAM and mapped out his adventure to Alaska. A big fan of author Jack London, McCandless wanted more out of life. He saw a hollowness in a typical post-college future. Krakauer paints McCandless as a young man on a solitary quest to enlightenment. By living off the wild, McCandless thought he would reach a sort of independent, spiritual apex in his life. Bumming rides, money, jobs on his cross-country adventure to land in Alaska, McCandless crossed into the lives of a handful of people, who were all seemingly touched by McCandless.   The book is noteworthy, chronicled by Krakauer in a reporter-like style. Christopher McCandless's great Alaskan adventure is one proving the remarkable nature and beauty of the human essence, proving Into The Wild a modern masterpiece.

From chapter one, Still Alice had me hooked.  I had never read a book from the perspective of the person WITH Alzheimer's.  I felt for the first time that I could really understand the experience of the disease through Alice.  This book was a real page-turner and I could not put it down.  I highly recommend Still Alice to anyone looking for a good read.

However I do agree with previous post in that he does repeat a lot of the same thing, but it is a good read.    I have not have finished reading the book, however it has helped me in certain points in my life.   For example; (1)Eating (lol) yes eating! I have become more aware as to what I am eating and how much of it. Making better food choices with some simple changes within my way of thinking. Providing the body with more of what it needs then what it wants - eating is becoming less of an issue.  (2) Being present in 'Today.' So many times we do get lost into our thoughts, thinking \\"what's next?\\", \\"I have to do this and this and that then I will be happy, complete\\" which is almost never the case. I complete what I need to complete, but also take time to really listen appreciate the moments (memories) when I am with my child or with friends.   (3) Anger - is it really worth it? Is it really worth it getting offended by a simple word, expression that someone made? ***Of course still need work in this area but it has improved.   I feel as I am more aware of the moment-    The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it does repeat it self somewhat. Of course this is a book that has many key points that will help you, but it easy to overlook it with the wealth of information it offers, so I will probably re-read it, in a few months.     I would recomend it as a good read, what do you have to lose?

This Henry Tilney is my new hero -- what a love!  Eleanor seemed a bit older than she is in the book, and they dressed her in an older style than the young Catherine, but that's my only real quibble with the production. All in all, it's excellent!
0061537934|5.0|Peter Egan's review from Road and Track sent me to this book.  Great read, bitter sweet, and often funny.  From an author (who is a racer) that truly understands the passion of Sports Car racing and how much it is under the skin of those who have the addiction-- but its not a \\"racing\\" story.  A good insight into the world, yet its just one element of the story
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This adaptation was disappointing, with the characters not really coming to life.  Everyone seemed rather leaden, actually.  Anne's 'race' around Bath at the end was totally unbelievable, and the kiss between Anne and Wentworth was staged so awkwardly that I nearly fast forwarded through it -- not pretty to look at. And what's up with Wentworth buying Kellynch for her at the end?  Stick to the 1995 version -- it was tons better!

0143038419|4.0|Though not the deepest of all the existential novels, there is something very sweet and familiar in Gilbert's Eat Pray Love.  Her writing is very straight forward and accessible.  The joy in this book is the common theme of self-discovery that is universal.  A bildungsroman for 30-somethings.

Them if you're still feeling bad, think about it long and hard before you decide to quit.  Second, take it one day at a time.  One evolution at a time.\\"  \\"Don't let you're thoughts run away with you, don't start planning to bail out because you're worried about the future and how much you can take.  Don't look ahead to the pain.  Just get through the day, and there's a wonderful career ahead of you.  Captain Joe Maguire, Navy Seal\\"  If this is not the best advice for LIFE, then I do not know what is.  These words had to have been crucial in Marcus's survival.    The book is so detailed that you actually feel as though you were a part of the experience on the mountain that day (not to mention the training leading up to and including Hell Week).  It was so real that I also felt a loss when Axe, Danny and Mikey were killed.    I had the opportunity to meet Marcus recently, and he was as humble as could be about what he did; he almost felt regretful about living, however, he knew he needed to tell the story of what happened out there.  He does not want any recognition; as he put it, \\"I was just doing my job.\\"   From a former U.S. Marine to a former Navy Seal, Thank you Marcus.  Semper Fidelis, Jesse Vitagliano

0142000671|5.0|The book, Of Mice and Men, has to be one of the good books I've read in a long time. The good parts about it are at the start, you get to meet the characters on how they act and the way they get along. Of course, there are some bad parts in books. One of them is when one of the bunk mates picks a fight with Lennie, because he is taller than him!   Of Mice and Men, Lennie Small and George Milton take a bus, after getting chased by a mob, to a new job. After a couple hours and a lot of walking, they get to the job only to get the job, get in a fight for no reason, and work for good money. About the characters, George and Lennie, George is a quick-witted man that became friends with Lennie back when they were younger. Lennie was told to go with George to get a job by his aunt Clara. They both have a dream of a ranch, where their friends can stay, and people they don't know can leave. Lennie dreams of tending the rabbits. After a while, George and Lennie meet Candy, a nice old man that said he would help in the dream ranch. The dream ranch may work out; they have most of the money, but somewhere along the way someone messes it up, and it falls back to the way it was. Do you think they get the dream ranch? Read the book to find out what all happens.
