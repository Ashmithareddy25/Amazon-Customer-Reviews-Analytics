B0053YGYO4|5.0|If you are a Coldplay fan, this cd will not disappoint you.  It has the music you expect and hope to hear from Chris Martin.  Every song is awesome, even Princess of China with Rihanna, which is a little out of the box for most Coldplay fans. Love this band and was so fortunate to see them on the Mylo Xyloto tour!

B003QTSMXE|4.0|Wall-E gives us an insight to what our future could be & it is heart felt that Wall-E falls for Eve. The graphics are excellent and the movie shows us how lazy we are becoming with more and more electronics being introduced to our lives.
034580404X|4.0|Very happy with the condition of the books....even though they were new.<br />Pricing was very economical.<br />Read them within two weeks... I think the story line is a little exaggerated, but isn't that what Non-Fiction is??? Now moved on to the next.<br />Also happy with the delivery time....received when promised<br />Could not have asked for more!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I read alot of historical romance novels and I was just great to see a show based upon the era I read.  Great Product. Great Price. And  look forward to the next seasons.

B004EPYZXU|5.0|This is a great movie.  Bought it for hubby and he liked it.  Nothing is wrong with it, I fall asleep during any movie!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|This movie is a good film for all suspense horror fans.  Daniel Radcliffe does a great job playing the lead role, which is NOT your  typical Harry Potter role.  Good spooky moments through out the movie.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story was unusal and the ending left me hanging.  I guess there will be another book following to continue the story.<br />The Hunger Games.

B005OK722U|2.0|I was hoping to be surprised, as I read all the negative reviews. I saw this film on netflix, I figured why not give it a shot? Now I didn't see the unrated edition, so I don't know how many changes were made.<br /><br />Story: A group of friends go to stay at a Hostel in vegas. There's the first problem, this should be taking place in europe, like the previous films, then again, this is a straight to video release, so they were probably on a budget. So like the previous films, everything goes wrong. Basically a bunch of crazy rich people kidnap them and tourture them on a stage infront of everyone. The kills were pretty bad. I mean shoving cocaroaches down someones throat? Not a hostel kill, seems pretty cheap. In the end of the film, when one of the guys get chainsawed, they don't even show it, you just here the guy screaming outside the house. Not gory at all. The only gore scene is when the guy's arm gets cut off, I gotta admit, I was pretty impressed. I'll admit the twists were good, but that doesn't make up for the lack of tourture that hostel is supposed to be. I won't give any spoilers away.<br /><br />Special effects: The special effects weren't bad, they just cheaped out on them. Even when the guy's arm gets cut off, there is little blood loss. Not scary at all.<br /><br />Acting: Ugh, slightly better than the syfy, but hammy. Again, when the guy's arm gets cut off, he shows little emotion, the only reason I gave that scene a thumb up was because it was the only \\"gory\\" scene in the movie. The villains sounded like they were reading off a script, but I guess I should have expected the from a straight to dvd release, and the fact that neither Takashi Miike were involved, or Quentin Tarantino. Even the female actress in the film was bad, the girlfriend.<br /><br />Verdict: Now before you go making your purchase, really think, If I were you, I would watch this either on netflix, or on a website somewhere. Seriously, I don't even know why they bothered making this, If you are a hardcore hostel fan, then buy it. Even the second film was bad, not horrible, but bad. And I bought the second film on dvd without thought because I loved the first film so much, and sadly, I felt let down. The idea was constuctive, turning an entire tourure into a show. There are good straight to videos, and there are bad ones, this one falls in between. If you want to see a REAL good straight to video release, check out \\"Captured\\". I may just by this for the collection since I have the first two, but other than that, It's a complete waste.his, If you are a hardcore hostel fan, then buy it.

B000SZK41M|5.0|Classic action movie. It has become a Christmas Eve tradition to watch this great film each year. Yippee ki yay!
B000HIVIOW|4.0|This movie, though maybe a bit slow, is a surprising hit for the kids under 3 years in my family. A perfect Christmas movie that's short enough for the whole family's attention span.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I tend to use either Pandora or TuneIn for music.  Xiia quickly became one of my favorite apps. Streaming is very fast and has a very good selection of stations to choose from.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I cannot change the color of the controls. The lettering is to dark. Otherwise,  this is a keeper.

B00935KWWO|5.0|This is hands down the best Twitter app you can install on a Kindle Fire. I use Tweet Deck on my phone and sometimes on my pc, this is very similar, even has a few extra features with image previews in column.  I had to download this on my phone and email it to my kindle to install it, it works great.  No clue why it is not available in app search on my Fire HD 8.9

B000MD9UJC|5.0|Love this product. I was thinking of spending a ton on one of those tactical flashlights and then saw this on Amazon. Gave my mini-mag a new life, and twice the range.<br />Highly recommend it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I found this film to be delightful and thought provoking. Each character is on their own solving life journeyand whined up in this cheap hotel where the propiertor is is too. The fun is in how they figure things out and resolving that it is never over until it is over.

B007FEZQF8|4.0|The kindle version in great, but the price is a bit abusive for such short comic books. The resources for reading it on kindle have pleased me, however.
0525952926|5.0|Although this is part 2 of a trilogy it can be read and enjoyed without reading part 1.  The characters are introduced naturally and convincingly, and nothing of importance is lost. (Still better to read book 1 first!!)<br /><br />Follet places his characters at important points in history, so while the book does not pretend to provide a comprehensive account of the time, there is enough background to get a feel for the period.  An excellent 'historical novel&#34;.

B004TI5N38|4.0|First time reading this author.  I thought the beginning was a little labored, but it took off once you got through the character defining sections.  Towards the end, I found myself fully engrossed in the story.  Very believable premise,  which is scary.  A good read.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I found this book really good. My impression of Lincoln from the book is simply that he was an incredibly good person---magnanimous, forgiving, shrewd, not quick to anger. I had forgotten that Lincoln appointed Chase to the Supreme Court of the U.S. Lincoln's forbearance and patience in keeping Chase in the cabinet----in spite of Chase's own presidential ambitions for 1864, are a marvel.

Lean Startup shows a disciplined approach for entrepreneurs (and entrepreneurial people) to look deeper into the ventures without fantasizing the endeavors.<br /><br />I have started adopting innovation accounting in our new and on-going projects. Thanks for the sharing.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible App is really good, and I am really disappointed that you cannot purchase this and a whole set of apps for your Kindle Fire HD, if you are living outside the US. In this day of technological advances you are selling a product outside the US and then telling users they cant purchase apps for the product. Amazon you should know better than that. SMH<br /><br />Apple here I come, because I can get whatever App I need for an iPad
B009O36EO0|5.0|If you want to listen to the songs from Loreen's CD \\"Heal\\" all of the songs are on YouTube (for now anyway). Fabulous voice and very appealing songs. She has her own sound. I bot it and very much enjoy it.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan, you'll love Rear Window.  If you are not familiar with Hitchcock, this is a great introduction to his work.  Rear Window is a timeless classic capturing the brillance of Hitchock, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.  The movie takes place in New York in the 50's during a hot spell.  In addition to having a great plot, the movie captures of bit of the culture of the 50's.  Everyone smokes.  No one has air conditioning.  Grace Kelly, like all of the lead actresses in Hitchcock movies, is blonde.  Rear Window is a great thriller worth watching.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all three and love every one of the books!  Hope you all read the complete set I'm sure you will enjoy!

B009FBX5M0|4.0|Such an interesting music CD.  The instumentals are so enchanting.  I bought this as a gift along with the  Life 50 Years of James Bond book.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie kept me glued to the screen waiting to see how this would turn out. It was entertaining and full of twists. If you like action adventure movies this has it all.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Has possibilities but it needs more work. It's too difficult to navigate and also is missing many sources. TuneIn Radio is a better choice.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I've watched the series more than once. It continues to stun and enlighten me. It is both about the men who fought the war and the battles they fought. I learned a great deal about the European campaign from watching this and then researching the things that were new to me.<br /><br />The introductions and then the full interviews with the Veterans is not to be missed. These men are so honest in their emotions, their memories and about the job they did in fighting for years for our country. They are all to be admired.<br /><br />Anyone interested in WWII--both battles and about the men who fought them--has got to watch this series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  I just recently started reading Nicholas sparks books, and I can't put them down.
B007REV4YI|3.0|2012 was really quite a thrilling year for moviegoers, one of the most interesting in a long time. The Hobbit, Amazing Spider-Man, Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and ... Skyfall, marking the 50th anniversary of James Bond, a historic marking in film history.<br />Despite being that old, the character never lost any of its appeal - remarkable when you consider that the series was in production almost continuously for five decades. Many tried to explain the magic of 007, but in the end, my point of view is this: movie magic is like love. If you can explain love, it's not love.<br /><br />Skyfall, like the two previous Craig outings, firmly positions Bond in the year 2012. But this time, it harkens back to his past, his childhood. So, while the plot itself doesn't use prominent source material, the film extensively explores the character's past as written by Ian Fleming.<br />You could rightfully say that the plot plays almost second fiddle to Bond's personal characterisation, the confrontation with his age and his relationship to M. This gives Daniel Craig a vast playing field to portray James Bond like he never was before, a fully fledged dramatic character. Indeed, what you will most likely take with you from this film is the acting and character scenes by Craig, Dench, Bardem and Fiennes.<br />However, this is where the good news probably end.<br /><br />With all the hype, and reviews calling this the best Bond film since Goldfinger, I rarely left a theater so dissapointed.<br />You know, ever since Casino Royale, and even in the Brosnan era, we were confronted with always the same tagline: Break out from the formula!<br /><br />With every new Bond movie, it appears like the producers say there will be something special. However, if you announce something special 10 times in a row, it's not that special anymore. And that is a trap the guardians of the Bond heritage should not fall into: replacing one formula with another.<br />When was the last time James Bond was sent on a regular, straightforward mission until the end? Well? That was precisely 17 years ago: GoldenEye.<br />That was the only movie that did not feature \\"specialties\\" such as \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\", Bond \\"going rogue\\" or Bond falling in love \\"for real\\" or Bond being constantly at odds with M.<br />The quintessential mistake the Bond producers made (and make) is their thinking that the formula didn't work anymore because of the lukewarm reception of the later Brosnans. It wasn't the formula that was wrong with these films - they were just averagely produced action films with average scripts.<br /><br />That mistake was mended when Craig took over, and still they feel like they can't just send Bond on a regular mission without detours or psychological WMD.<br />The motto of these films may be \\"away from the formula\\" and \\"more realistic\\", and still there is that nagging feeling deep inside that says been there, done that. When Bond feels betrayed by M, when the villain hints at being Bond's darker side ...<br /><br />But fine, these are deeper flaws, let's assume it's a given, and you are not bothered by it. Then Skyfall still has many flaws.<br />First and foremost, the plot. It was almost a miracle that the same guys who \\"wrote\\" Die Another Day also contributed to the Craig scripts. This time, however, Purvis and Wade let their Die Another Day mindset shine through.<br />Skyfall focuses on Bond being too old and failing his test, even though Quantum of Solace showed a Bond who just received his 00-status. Makes no sense. Even less sense makes the fact that even though focusing on a list of all undercover agents worldwide for more than an hour, leading even to M's retirement, it disappears in a magic cloud of smoke, never to be mentioned again.<br />Silva's scheme to kill M relies on so many coincidences that it even insults the term \\"deus ex machina\\".<br /><br />He gets captured. Deliberately. Then he escapes, also planned (let's forget for a minute that his escape seems to rely on the assumption that MI6 would hire exactly the guy who invented Silva's choice software for encryption), and I ask myself why he wants to get captured in the first place; apparently, to see M. But since he seems to know out of nowhere where and when she will have a semi-public hearing (that coincidentally happens when he gets captured), why would he bother?<br />Indeed, I have come to accept many impossibilities in Bond movies - they simply belong in there.<br /><br />But: we see Bond being shot twice, once hitting organs (as hinted at later), falling 500 meters to his demise, drowning on top of that. 10 minutes later, we see him banging a woman on some beach, conveniently focusing on the wound at his shoulder and forgetting the one that seems to have punctured his liver, and back in action. Gloss over much?<br />I have an easier time believing Jaws could have actually survived the freefall in Moonraker.<br />Then Berenice Marlohe's character. She's introduced in utterly brilliant scenes in Macau and Shanghai, making you believe she could be the best Bond girl since Natalya in GoldenEye. And then? Killed in the very next scene. What an awful waste.<br />Being a film music fan, Thomas Newman's score remains dull and generic, without the faintest memorable thematic wisper or hint at Bondian romanticism, strings chopping away every 30 seconds in an attempt (!) to generate thrill - the most forgettable Bond score since the original Dr. No score by Monty Norman.<br /><br />Other things dragging the film down: an opening titles montage that feels like you are being sucked into an animated Tim Burton film, a finale on a graveyard that feels like a Tim Burton set, unintentional comedy when Bond plays \\"Bond Home Alone\\" at his family lodge, complete with exploding floorboards. And a dangerous reminder of better days when Bond drives M to safety in the old Aston Martin DB5, seemingly parked randomly in the city because we don't have enough hommages to freaking Goldfinger piled up, the last significant one was only in the very last movie!<br />Speaking of continuity, at the finale, a weeping Bond holds M in his arms and kisses her forehead. Really. An emotional Bond is one thing, a wimp another. This isn't the same man who threw Mathis' body into a garbage can in Quantum.<br />At some point I was praying that Bond's housekeeper wouldn't lead M to Bond's room and show baby pictures or a photo of his parents dancing in falling leaves.<br /><br />Skyfall is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it surely isn't the revelation people are making it out to be.<br />We have now spent *three* entire movies to set up James Bond as we know him! For Christ's sake, enough with the Stockholm syndromes, the psychoanalysis of Bond's mind, the mother complexes and the broken hearts! After 10 years of this stuff, one is longing for a bloody Roger Moore escapist adventure.<br />It's time Bond walks right into the office to learn his mission again. That doesn't mean the movies can't be down to earth as they are now, and Bond sticking to Fleming's characterisation, but Bond being personally involved in everything for 15 years now is tiring beyond belief. Connery's films never needed that heavy stuff despite not resorting to pure comedy.<br />Despite contrary statements, the feel of the Connery films was never reproduced. Don't be fooled into believing it isn't possible.<br /><br />Perhaps the Broccolis should actually watch Goldfinger to search for something else than the possibility to pay hommage to it.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought this item to charge my Kindle Fire.  It was described specifically as a charger for the Kindle Fire.  This NEVER worked.  I am extremely disappointed as this came directly from Amazon and is worthless.  Waste of my time & money!!!  I still cannot find a charger on the market that works with my Kindle Fire.  The one that came with it lasted less than a year and I bought another through a different vendor that didn't work either.  I give up at this point!!
B0011WL8MK|2.0|I must like the movie; this is the second DVD of it I've bought.  But this disc, like the first (though from a different seller) is defective.  Damaged areas mean big jumps in the DVD, whole scenes are unwatchable.  Too bad.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Not a terrible movie but nothing stellar either. Falls far short of other time travel related movies like Terminator and Back to the Future. Plot was quite predictable too.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|A top quality production complete with extras and behind the scenes features. The casting is perfect and the grandeur and scale of the staging at the Royal Albert Hall are amazing. Order it soon (and hope that the delivery guy doesn't leave it on the doorstep of a vacant house at the top of my street like mine did. : )
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone who has ever liked a fantasy novel. It's got political scheming, potential magic, action, adventure, and, goodness!, does it have drama. With only minimal hyperbole, I had trouble putting this series down. The world built in this series is very engaging and the characters equally so, for the most part. And, this particular version was a great choice: four books for quite a bit less than what you would pay for them all individually.<br /><br />That said, there IS a fifth book at the time of my writing. It would be a better bet to get that five-book bundle that's floating around on Amazon.<br /><br />But, I cannot stress this enough, give the series a try!
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Its a good story in itself yet not at the grandeur and scale and youthful innocence of the original Phantom of the Opera. The DVD is full of extra features and well worth the viewing for all Phantom fans.

It gives you the ability to open, edit, save files both on SDcard as well as stored in the cloud in BOX, DropBox, and Google Docs .. really excellent product. I will admit that I tried another office package that was a little prettier, but did not have the capabilities of this one. Excellent work!!! Very satisfied. Thank you.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this action-packed game a couple of months ago and showed it to my pre-teen grandsons. They absolutely went wild about it and seemed to automatically know how to play (smart cookies LOL). Bottom line: I bought each of them an Android tablet for Christmas and put this program on their own personal tablets.<br /><br />We have enjoyed hours and hours with this app, highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love all these books. I am going to read them again. Great story line. Every one should read all of them
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This little app turns your Android color tablet &#34;Kindle Fire-Like&#34; only better (IMHO), cause you still have full Android capabilities along with the ability to acquire e-books from Amazon .. I say this a little tongue in cheek cause I understand that the new Fire line is much more friendly and Android-y ..<br /><br />Amazon is a wealth of reading materials, much of it no-cost. You won't be disappointed at all, give it a try!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book. You know if you've read it. I am thinking about reading it again. Love the story line. Thanks
B008XG1X18|5.0|My wife has been a Pinterest enthusiast for months on her laptop, She showed it to me and I thought it would be a great addition to my tablet. I was right!! Graphics are great, everything runs smoothly, glad I got it. What more can I say???
B007UQRW62|5.0|My wife loves this movie and the blu ray is fantastic! The umbrella is a little silly but a nice touch.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have been familiar with Flipboard from my days with my iPad, so it was natural that I download the Android version when I got my Android tablet. I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />Flipboard is my #1 Go-To-Every-Day app. It ties together my facebook and tweets and gee-whiz... everything else in the world into one easy-to-navigate series of pages the &#34;flip&#34; literally. Great graphics, works like a charm!!!!! You gotta get this one for sure!
B008VBYN80|4.0|I kinda thought it would suck but its pretty cool only thing is that there needs to be more ways to get diamonds without having to pay real money
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|fun...fun...different take on Tesla story line and pleasant hunt overall for clues and conclusion. mini games were a pleasant change from the typical usual to these games... thx for the re-wire...
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Very disappointed with this game. Did not like it at all. I could not believe how scrappy it was. Expected better than that.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This will be a cult classic. The cast do a spectacular performance by creating fictitious community that draws you into the lives of coming to age youth's with a  odd tainted love spin. Bruce Willis breaks his tough guy casting with his great performance. Bill Murray is Bill Murray, always a top performance. Entire cast does a great job.
1401324649|5.0|The title captivated me and I was totally pleased to follow this tale with it's warmth, assortment of characters, humor, mystery, and flashbacks through history. I gave the book as a Christmas present to friends who appreciate good writing. It's the kind of book I want to read all over again.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Have to make a good cut on a bottle. May be more the material than the product but that should clear up front that perfect cuts are unlikely.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, Vince Flynn has written another exciting, spell-binding thriller. I enjoyed it from page one to the last page.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I bought this item as a collector's item so it could be displayed proudly as the center piece of my Walking Dead Collection.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it to see that the details shown in the pictures were not exaggerated at all.  I will not be opening the actual DVD's and will be keeping this in a low lit area and will also be keeping all of the original packaging so that I can hold whatever collector value it has.  Overall, the head looks great and does what I expected it to do....it grosses out the wife!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When this first came out I was skeptical it sounded ridiculous and dumb but turns out my dear friends arnt exactly great at explaining heck their so bad I thought peata was named Pam but now that I've read it I know it's a wonderful book and I rarely get drawn into the book though it took me awhile to do so this is kinda like the stuff I write rebellious but fictional  overall it was a good book but I still don't understand why every one freaked over it , then again I am one of the few lone wolves of the pack we call school soon us loners will group and merge into our own pack that will one day have as many adventures as writers do in the world of paper
B008BIZ06M|4.0|Let's just get the only major gripe I have with this album out of the way: It simply isn't as good in comparison to previous endeavors by The Offspring. Through my experience there hasn't been an album by these guys that I didn't like. Some just end up being better than others. I simply prefer the energy and sound of works like Ignition and Americana.<br /><br />Regardless, there is a lot that this album has going for it. For starters, Dexter's vocals, Noodles' guitar work, and Pete's drumming are great. Greg K's bass works is sadly not that prominent throughout the album. The overall quality of each song varies. The Future is Now is a great opening to the album, Days Go By is my favorite original song on the album, and I have even warmed up to songs like OC Guns and Secrets from the Underground). As for the ever dividing Cruisin' California, I actually rather enjoyed it for the fun joke song it was meant to be. If you ask me for my favorite song on here, it most definitely has to be their re-recording of Dirty Magic from their Ignition album (my favorite song by The Offspring). While I prefer the faster tempo and quality of the original, I love this version's guitar work and added vocals. The rest of the songs, while not as memorable, are still good.<br /><br />Overall, as a stand alone album or as an album for people that aren't big on The Offspring's earlier hits it is worth a listen. For hardcore fans, you may not get as much enjoyment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I first downloaded this and deleted it cause I didn't know what it was like but once I installed it again I loved it
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Loved it . Great book and great tv series although they are different, can't wait to read the next one
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book is well written and easy to enjoy. It is an interesting and fresh fairytale with wonderful old photographs used to enhance the story. I found this to be an excellent and peculiar read....Worth it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you haven't played this...don't start unless you're willing to get totally caught up in another addiction!<br /><br />Then, I found out you could play in more that one suit!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple to use. If you simply need the basics, this is the app for you.  No fanfare, simple calculations and it also has a memory.  The big buttons make using it a  breeze.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first foray into the Jack Reacher series.  I like to read in order...<br />A friend recommended and I found it a great thriller.<br /><br />A fast read when you need one.
B008B68J2G|5.0|I like this play set the cafe is sturdy and is fun for my daughter to play with it does have small food parts so if you have smaller children that might be an issue.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Once you've tried Spider Solitaire.<br /><br />But if you like the traditional game of cards, this is for you.<br /><br />Fun for starters.
B008B68IUY|5.0|I like this car better than the roadster my daughter has both and this one is much easier to get the dolls in and out of.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I must admit it took me a bit of time to get into this story.<br />But....once there, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Twists and turns that revealed so much about the characters.<br /><br />Loved it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Interesting. What happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. Enjoyed reading this crazy love filled and sex filled book.
B000002A46|4.0|I had this on my list for years and had thought it was a complete package that I would enjoy like others that I have (Estefan, Alex O'neal)...she delivers but the songs are not always happy celebratory.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Works exactly as it says in description. Perfect tv connect solution for Nexus 4. No lag at all which is great for games.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Great movie.  I'm a Clint Eastwood fan.  It was funny, sad, and the ending was a great surprise.  It is a movie you will keep thinking about.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|For its simple functionality just plain awesome. The connection is so easy to setup in seconds u have full access to ur pc. Luv it.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Simply a great movie.  The acting and actors are great.  If you like Westerns and Robert Duvall, this is a good as it gets.
B003UYUP5I|5.0|After falling in love with How I Met Your Mother it was easy for me to fall in love with the simplicity and stupidity of this book. It is In no way, shape, or form serious but the humor and consistent warped view of relationships and the first encounter with someone your hitting on is nothing but delightful when you want to pass the time. The narration is only a plus if your a fan of the show with all the extra ad libbing.
0525952926|4.0|Enjoyable, especially if you like Follett's other books.  Although the way he structures his stories seems to follow a similar pattern and becomes repetitive.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun game for passing time when I need to take my mind off stressful things.  starts simple & gets more difficult as you progress.
B008ENA74E|3.0|The media says Smith was not that bad on GS in the book, and actually GS came out looking good. I disagree with that. But I would have liked to have seen more jabs.
0143037757|3.0|I realize that reviews here should be directed toward content rather than format, but for Kindle users, format is the way to the content.<br /><br />Because of aging eyes, I am no longer able to deal with the tiny print in the original hardbound copy I bought and read circa 2005. I had read the previous reviews of the Kindle presentation and thought, perhaps, the problem of the lack of links to individual chapters within the four parts of the book had been solved.  Alas no. So I am painstakingly,with notes,following the hardback page numbers to make my own links. The Kindle edition, unlike the book, has no index, so, with the help of a magnifying glass, I get the page numbers from the hard-bound index in order to locate places in the Kindle version. Painful, but because of the book's contents, worth the effort.<br /><br />What if one doesn't have the hard-back copy?  Does the paperback use the same paging?  Why wouldn't Penguin have made this important book more user friendly for Kindle users?
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Most movies made today aren't worth your time to watch them, even for free. I only ask to be entertained without thinking throughout the movie that what I'm watching and hearing is stupid. This was an entertaining film that was one of those what came first the chicken or the egg?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My husband was very happy to receive this item in his Xmas stocking - he loves Adele and her music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 Am I closed my e reader sighed and thought Ill be reading this again.<br /><br />Hopeless is one of those books that will make you cry, smile and have your heart aching for the good and the bad ! You will gasp at discoveries throughout the read and every character you meet you will find, has a depth and connection of there own.<br /><br />The characters lives are certainly no bed of roses, but the way in which Colleen Hoover captivates the reader is just amazing. It will pull at your heart strings, have you giddy and smiling and also have your heart aching for all the pain the characters experience..but also all the love within.<br /><br />Sacrifices are made, truths are uncovered and as a reader I can see a means to and end.<br /><br />Certain parts are hard to fathom - these moments will have you sniffing, and feeling so drawn to the characters you not only feel the pain but the sorrow.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chemistry between Holder and Sky - it was just so damm sizzling . The love was not based on just the physical side but that side we dont see alot of in many books. True love...<br /><br />A deep connection. A past that was forgotten - memories that are uncovered and a future with answers.<br /><br />Holder was Sky's overall savour in more ways than one - and finding out SKy's story also brings a little closure to Holder's sister Less.<br /><br />The last few chapters are a real eye opener - but despite what a Hopeless situation it seemed at the time, the ending was everything a reader could want and more !<br /><br />Hopeless is a thrilling, yet intense,and addictive read that is shocking in it's violence in certain parts yet emotionally touching and certainly emotionally draining at times.<br /><br />The characters breathe a life of their own within these pages and the world and story that Colleen has created is so well detailed it will make you cringe, laugh, love and cry.<br /><br />My favourites quote -<br /><br />Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />( SIGH )<br /><br />I just loved Holder ......<br /><br />A must read for all romanctics, but be prepared for a few twists and turns that you will certainly not expect !!<br /><br />Gripping, compelling and totally wow !ays in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I play it on my kindle fire. this game is addicting. I play it all the time.
B003HARV4S|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out in 2006. From the opening strains of the haunting Philip Glass score I was pulled into the story. The pre-World War I Europe depicted in the film is rich, deep, and fully believable. Edward Norton in the title role gives a satisfying performance and fully inhabits his character. Jessica Beil is believable as the love interest. Rufus Sewell obviously enjoyed throwing around his weight in his role as the crown prince and heir to the Austria-Hungary empire. However it is Paul Giamatti who pulls off the most amazing performance in the movie and, by the end, is the pivotal character of the story. The final five minutes of the film, perfectly built up over the course of the script, released a series of magical 'ah-ha&#34; moments that I thought about for several days.<br /><br />As a side note, I have found that this film and the similarly mystical 2006 film &#34;The Prestige&#34; (I can only assume some type of big studio competition to have two such similar films taking place in the same historical timeframe released only a few weeks apart from each other) had very different effects on audiences. Those who first saw &#34;The Illusionist&#34; thought &#34;The Prestige&#34; was the inferior movie, and vice versa. My enjoyment of &#34;The Illusionist&#34; is certainly colored by seeing it before &#34;The Prestige&#34;.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed the Harry Potter books and this confirmed what a good writer she is.  Characters and plot were engaging.  Not a light read by any means and some dark subject matters.
1594487154|5.0|To Sell is Human is a wonderful book for anyone looking to deepen their skills to connect and move others.  Which is pretty much all of us!<br /><br />Pink has a great method to his writing.  He takes unique and sometimes contrarian ideas, links up relevant social science research to validate and adds great human stories that tie it all together.  Juggling these pieces is challenging, but Pink manages to do this in a relaxed, informative style.<br /><br />In To Sell is Human, one central idea is: Buyers have almost equal knowledge (and therefore equal leverage)as sellers.  This means the days of \\"Used Car Sales\\" are over.  Pink demonstrates this in many ways, most enjoyably by spending time with used car sales guys - both old style and modern.  The results are striking - and lets his humorous field observations make the point.<br /><br />Another core idea: Everyone Sells, and doing it well is about being in service to others.  He shares a lot of detail on this, including multiple approaches and methods built around solid social science research.<br /><br />I'm a long time fan of Daniel Pink's books, so I jumped at the chance review an early copy.  Living up to his last book [[ASIN:184767769X Drive]] is a tall order, but Pink met and might have exceeded it. To Sell is Human is a must read.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|i was a little disappointed with this cd of whitney houston, it sounded to me that this was'nt  remastered at all
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Not Oscar caliber, but an interesting and quirky plot.  A bit predictable in spots, but still a fun flick.  Go for it!
1444737112|5.0|I bought this book on a chilly morning in Tokyo; after spending the holidays and New Year's alone in a foreign country, away from my family and friends, I was looking for something light to read that would cheer me up.  This book did that and more.  I wound up reading it all in one afternoon.  It is a wonderful book!<br /><br />The story is told in a very simple, straight-forward way.  James's story is very believable and heart-breaking at times.  Ultimately, it is a story of hope.  Bob the cat may be the star (and he is quite a character!) but I found myself really engaged with James (the human) too.  I wanted him to succeed.  By the end of the book, I felt as though I had been through a journey with James and Bob.  I definitely felt happier and hopeful after turning the last page.<br /><br />But the end of the book is not the end of the story, I think!  I'd like to hear much more about James and Bob the cat in the future - maybe he will write a second book, telling about how his life has changed after the success of this book?  I hope so.  In the meantime, I will continue to watch the cute videos of Bob the Big Issue cat on YouTube and look forward to further news of their adventures.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone, though cat-lovers, and those who have been down-and-out, will particularly enjoy it, I think.  I think everyone could benefit from opening their minds and hearts to stories like James and Bob's, though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it it is amazing and fast! I can see the pictures so clearly and I can even upload my own pins! :) two thumbs up!
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. does a great job of playing the super hero and the filming technology of this movie is simply fantastic
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app does a good job of letting you share web finds on pinterest.  works well on my kindle fire although a tad slow.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|I like the Bond movies and this one is more the middle of the road in thinking overall about James Bond movies
B005MJ883K|2.0|Maze just frustrates the kids. Ball keeps falling out of the track. The storage bag is to small. There is no way can put the ball in that bag. Not happy with this purchase at all.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Stallone still has it with the idea of this story and eventually he will become lengedary for this type of film category!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i personaly love this game its a good alternative to carrying ur laptop around and for 7 bucks i found this a great steal to play on line on the computer is over 2o dollars! This also looks great on my kindle fire hd i also use my phone so if someone doesnt have it they can use my phone because  can cross system play (kindle to phone,phone to ipod ect.) so a great deal overall and if u habe the full version on any device u can play together (highest unknown did have 4 people playing once though)
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Director and Story writer does a bang up job for making a continuation of the story beyond what Matt Damon was doing when he left the story line....
B009G78EE2|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. I've loved Macklemore for a long time and am so glad he and Ryan Lewis finally got around to releasing this.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Stallone showed he can taken a licking and keep on ticking with a great story and great film effects based on where he came from!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|[[ASIN:B007R3AZNK Driving Towards The Daylight]]<br />Am fairly new as a Bonamassa listener. First cd of his that I bought - Dust Bowl.<br />2nd cd - Driving Towards The Daylight<br />3rd cd - Live From Royal Albert Hall.<br />They keep getting better with every purchase I make.<br />There's not a bad one in the bunch. They're all terrific.<br />Not only is Bonamassa an awesome guitarist, he's also a darn good songwriter with a<br />good voice. On top of all that, he's a excellent showman in person.<br />This is one talented young artist !<br />I can see why his shows are sold-out.  People have been waiting for someone like him to<br />emerge, for a long time. It's great hearing the return of quality Blues Rock !!
B00005JPS8|2.0|This was a mistake purchase and I will not make this mistake again I assure you. I enjoy the BluRay quality better as the effects and picture quality is simply amazing to say the least
B001F12J48|3.0|As with the Shrek 3D movie this product is not just for 3D tv's. It can be used with any tv. I bought this for my daughter and son in law thinking it was for their 3D tv. It did state this but I just didn't realize it after seeing the 3D symbol I just assumed was for 3D televisons only. This product takes the red/blue glasses.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This can keep you occupied for ages with all the possibilities of design, color, applications and even erasures.  There is no age limit on those who can enjoy this fun adventure into design.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I always find myself staring at the game waiting for more coins so I can get the prize!  this game is addicting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was amazing! I flew through all three books! I wish the series was never-ending!I am sad that I have finished them all.<br /><br />---and I would like the world to know that it was my 17-year-old daughter who \\"flew through\\" those books, not her considerably older mother, who does not have time enough left in her life to spend it on \\"Twilight, but with more sex.\\"
B009MCRHH6|4.0|a simple game that requires some puzzle solving skills, great time killer in waiting rooms.  Although I would recommend turning the sound off.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started the series out of curiosity; I had heard it called \\"mommy porn\\". But it truly is a sweet, sweet love story about overcoming obstacles. Loved all three books.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I love the TV program Castle, found the book okay.  I will continue to watch, but not sure I will purchase anymore books.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well, you know you can't just leave off where Catching Fire ends. I won't spoil it, but you'll feel pleased in the end. And you can finally resume your life after you've finished the trilogy.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This is a fantasy that I could have done without.  On the one hand there are the very realistically disgusting discriptions of gore ingested for the purpose of survival, and on the other hand fantasy flights of imagnination that do not appear possible in the fantasy settling the author attempted to create.  I unforunately read the whole thing expecting a redeeming quality of some sort that never appeared for me.  Perhaps others have found something I missed, but I am not inclined to back back for a second look.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My 15 year old daughter recommended we watch this together and we LOVED it!  There is a lot of creativity, musical talent and humor involved.  It will be a great memory for us to reflect on.
B005FISBTO|5.0|The show is great, I just felt I needed to complain about the DVDs.  Every DVD starts with a long commercial advertisement for Showtime and you are forced to watch it every time.  It won't allow me to fast forward through it.  I shouldn't be forced to watch this if I'm paying for the DVDs.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a great product for protecting your new Kindle Fire.  It's not too bulky or flimsy and looks really nice too.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for some extra protection for their purchase that is durable.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Don't miss the first three or four minutes or you will wind up wondering what the ..... is going on!<br />An absolute waste of 2+ hours.  Should have just gone back and watched all three of the original Bournes.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is the perfect first person shooter for the casual and serious gamers. If yo enjoyed playing N.O.V.A. or the previous Modern Combat games, this may be for you.
B0098460O4|5.0|After their appearance on BGT show, I knew an album would be out - so I waited and this is a wonderful collection of songs.  Charlotte's voice is so strong and mellow and could easily stand on her own talent.  I love this album!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|A couple of funny moments, but really just a Glee rip-off, this movie is not for discerning adults (or any adults for that matter).
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works great I haven't had any trouble with the app so I'm happy. Kindle fire HD<br />Five star to the app personally.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|This movie is one of the best movies based on a video game that I've seen, and as a gamer, I've seen a lot of them. Definitely a movie worth watching!
1572700955|5.0|Good story. Jane Austen showed people with honorable, dishonorable, deceived, officicous, vacant, characters, and developed them beautifully, showing great insight into people's foibles.
B0035XQW74|5.0|I absolutley love this movie!  One of the best. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx gave brilliant performances!  A must see!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|just have started the game...has excellent graphics...playing medium level....always enjoy g5 games...keep the good games coming....I love hidden object games with mystery...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great game to play once you get the hang of it. It is very challenging as you go farther into the levels. If you get stumped you may need another eye to help. It challenges your brain a bit too.  I have gotten some that you have to be a little creative to get the puzzle to work out. Not bad for a free game I will be purchasing the other one soon. That is how much I like it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app...makes it so simple to do everything from my Kindle.  Even faster than booting up the old computer!
B004SBX112|5.0|Oh this one is easy.  Who does not like angry birds? Now the pigs they are not so nice.  I thoroughly enjoy this game. The seasons give you something cute to look at too.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fast pace bingo game.  If you like to play bingo this is a fun one to play .  You play and level up land there are more rooms in the higher levels.  They are fun to play when you are bored or anytime you just want something different to do .  Each room is a little different but the same in the end because it is after all Bingo.  If you try this game and think you wish you had not gotten it, give it a few more tries.  You will find it gets easier and a lot more fun as you play more often. Good luck and get that first BINGO it is very exciting!

B002RI9PKO|5.0|In his book, Outliers, Gladwell argues that there is no secret to success. There are key ingredients, he says, such as being in the right place at the right time, receiving extra tutoring/training, and additional opportunities. Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc? In summary, there are no short cuts to success and very few successful people who have not put in their 10,000 hours of practice. Now, stop reading this review and get practicing!
B008QMMEOE|3.0|Downloaded this app for my 3 year old granddaughter, she played with it for a few days then got bored.
075669910X|5.0|Great book with fantastic all-round details, images and diversity of the various types of life through out the billions of years this planet has existed.<br />Truly just fantastic value for a really great book.<br />Could not be more happy with my purchase, thanks very much Amazon! :D
B00000IL26|5.0|Never heard of this trumpet virtuoso before listening on satellite radio but I was sold after my first listen to the song &#34;The Sidewinder.&#34; An outstanding lineup of musicians playing top-notch Jazz music in a traditional format albeit with an elan and gusto that is bound to give one a lifetime of listening pleasure and wonder at just how such beautiful music is created!
1844256383|5.0|This book is outstanding! It gives helpful information on everything from how to choose the perfect saxophone to fixing and maintaining the instrument. As a saxophonist, I can say there are many times the horn may not sound right or a key feels sticky. This book helps you in diagnosing the problem and provides step-by-step solutions that are very easy to understand. In my opinion, it should be on the shopping list of anyone who owns or plans on owning a saxophone. My only complaint is that I wish I would have found it sooner.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I loved watching the series on Hulu Plus and am now thoroughly enjoying owning both seasons. Buying Seasons One and Two as a set makes it all that more convenient to watch the series straight through and is additionally an excellent value.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Great effects and action, can't go wrong. There is good comedy too I would recommend this movie to anyone out there
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It's hard to read about this poor girl who can't make herself trust anyone. The one betrayal of sorts was hard to believe, but by then I was plugging on to see how the story ended. This book was saved by the titled substory, a subject that always interested me. You'll have a good catalogue of flower language at the end.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|It starts off quick ,but then slows down. I did enjoy it. I liked how it gave the green lantern history up front so anyone could watch and understand
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was very enjoyable. I look forward to reading the others in the series. I am very intrigued by the end of this book and interested to see how the author addresses the underlying story in this edition.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This game is good.  Very good;  but there's just one flaw this game folow's the consept of the original Cut The Rope but for this one... you have to pay so don't waste your time... and money.  Like I said this game is good and Cut The Rope is good so don't pay for what you can get practily the same and free.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This is a fabulous read. I was unsure about this one because I could never get into a 'Harry Potter' book/CD and didn't really know what to expect. I would recommend this book to everyone. It is so 'unputdownable'
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is really cool.  I love it but they have other Cut The Rope's out there.  For Example I no of (and is a really great game)  Cut The Rope: Experiments which I love as well as this game.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|What's not to like about this movie? It's an oldie but goodie. I also bought this movie for my 4 year old daughter. She loves action movies.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|I love this game and my title may have thrown you off...BUT why pay?  why pay for the exat same thing that you can get for free!  This is HD and the plain Pudding Monsters is just as fine and you can get it free.  This game is good but is the price?
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I hate when books waste my time and this one does. It starts well and then there's nothing new to add but the book just keeps on going and I kept reading looking for more interesting stuff.<br /><br />The info is interesting but it's only on 10% of the book the rest is fillers.<br /><br />For this info a 30 page book would do it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was a great read, could not put it down. Can't wait to get into book 2. I hope it is as good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just found out about TWD and I love the show!<br />I've never been particularly into zombies but you don't have to be with this show. It is incredible, give it a shot!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked it. It has a good twist. It's not a fairy tale but not an ending nearly as depressing as I expected based on other reviews. The close of the book is a little quick for my taste but it leaves some to the imagination which I think is a good thing in this case. You want more but are forced to think hat happened on your own. It's a good quick read and definitely worth while. And anyone who dislikes it because of decisions that the characters made need to get over it. Life is not usually what you expect and this is a decent portrayal of humans behavior. I like that she makes them as human as she can.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I have some suggestions for this demo to be better. What you can do is first give us infinite demo time BUT we just can't have certain items and some items we have to collect like wood. I hope the creators look at this. And my thoughts about the game is that its a very good game but its too short. You give us only one day and that just isn't enough because in the demo, its about 15 minutes. Please read this. ~Ms. Burrito
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I don't think I have ever read a book so fast in my life! I liked reading the different perspectives. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Jeff Lynne, the man behind the Electric Light Orchestra, one of the most creative and timeless pop groups of the 70's and 80's, has released a new solo album of cover songs.  Titled, \\"Long Wave,\\" Lynne takes the opportunity to pay tribute to the various styles and artists who have influenced him throughout his long, prosperous career.  Based on the selections on this release, you could truly justify the eclecticism of Lynne's recordings throughout the years.<br /><br />Lynne plays all the instruments on this album, and the songs are at their strongest when he uses his signature vocal arrangements that have figured so prominently in his music, particularly on the Charles Aznavour standard, \\"She,\\" and \\"Running Scared\\" by the late Roy Orbison, one of Lynne's bandmates in the 1980's supergroup, The Traveling Wilburys.<br /><br />Several Broadway classics are featured on this collection. The Rodgers and Hart staple, \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,\\" and the famous \\"If I Loved You,\\" from the 1945 musical, \\"Carousel,\\" are both included, in addition to \\"Love Is a Many Splendid Thing\\" and the Charlie Chaplin piece, \\"Smile.\\"  Purists will scratch their heads at listening to Lynne's vocal on these tunes, but fans of his work will accept his versions of these tunes as the expansive risks of an artist with little to prove at this point.<br /><br />More predictable choices include Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock,\\" considering the Electric Light Orchestra's early success covering Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" and the Alvin Lee rocker, \\"Mercy Mercy,\\" whose bluesy sound provides a sensible fit for those familiar with Lynne's work.  He also adds \\"So Sad,\\" a 1973 song from Beatle George Harrison, another former bandmate (along with Bob Dylan and Tom Petty) from the Wilburys, to the setlist.<br /><br />The recording is short: out of the eleven tracks, none of them reaches the three-minute mark. However, it is nice to have some new sounds from a timeless rock-and-roller.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This should be a warning to the young immersional women out there. A person has to have a good deal of self respect. It was kinky, crazy & a good fast read in the airport terminals.
B004G600A4|5.0|The purchase of this video went without any problems whatsoever.  The video has worked without any problems. Everthing has worked and gone as advertised.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs has lived a facinating life. It was nice to see the progression of his lifes achievements. and his downs.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I ordered this as a Christmas present for my sister-in-law.  She loved it.  She said it was just the one she wanted!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Really enjoyed this one.  Very hard to put down. I liked the different points of view of the characters. I will check out her other novels.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift and was afraid it would not arrive in time, but i got it in time.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This book was very slow at first.  It picked up towards the end and ended up having a nice twist once I got into it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was heart tugging, full of tears and laughter. I could not put it down! So well written, wished it never ended
B004H83IM8|2.0|I was expecting three DVDs. One had two movies and which may be OK if it at least where labeled. Spend a little more money.
B00005U122|4.0|I am a little disappointed with the video and sound sync. the sound is about a half second ahead of the video but the show is so good I would still recommend it!
098555780X|5.0|great book, I enjoy it everyday, compare other books , this one is my favorite.  It it clear understanding pictures and instructions. You can may changes to the patterns and still come out great.  THANK YOU!!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I'm a fan of the Dark Knight or the darker Batman characters so this movie was an excellent wrap up to the Dark Knight series.  I enjoy the &#34;ethical dilemmas&#34; that confront Batman in his &#34;work&#34;.  This movie was well-cast and Anne Hathaway as CatWoman was particularly effective.  Probably my one criticism was the villain Bane.  Didn't think the whole enhanced voice thing added to his character at all - and seemed a little dated Darth Vaderish.  I haven't watched this on DVD yet but expect the excellent production values(sound, special effects, etc) to translate well to my TV screen
B0014QABX0|4.0|I thought this was a great album and had a good mix of songs.<br />Good for a long drive and or working out in the gym.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Love it.  I kept coming back for more. Every time I put it down I will immediately jump right back for more. My fastest reading by to this date: 3 days.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was absolutely captivated by the story`s use of flowers to express and project thoughts, Feelings and emotions.  Elizabeth, Victoria and Grant are wonderful complex characters that I wish to know more about ··· The Language of Flowers is in my top 10 favorites books!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Really fun plot and characters, good action sequences. Better than average sequel. The computer generated aspect was very well done.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good time killer, but nothing really challenging. Honestly reviewing it for the in game points. Words Words Words Words Words
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I am a fan of Cher, Christina and Stanley Tucci, so I thought this was a great fun sexy romp of a movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have played most of the G5 games and this one was very enjoyable.  Perfect for a rainy afternoon.  Lots of fun.
B00846TRHY|4.0|My husband and I decided to watch this movie having no idea about the background or story of the main character.  All in all, it was a very good movie with a very strong message concerning the impact of civil war in the Sudan and how children are being affected.
B000001F26|5.0|Excellent CD of the best songs of Eric Clapton. I would recommend this to anyone else who enjoys his music.
B0000630YA|5.0|Ok,I admit it. I bought this album not only because it is a great album,but it is an album from the time I grew up, so I figured it was time to buy it on CD. That begs the question: when listening to it now, has it passed the the test of time,or or does it  seem dated and not-so-good after all?<br />The answer is that it sounds great. Like a true classic. I think a lot of people forget to see past the Alice Cooper character, with the spectacular stage show and everything. This is an artist with a lot of great songs, and it shows on this record as well. Just listen to a gem like \\"Only Women Bleed\\". The idea however, that this album is built upon,is Alice Cooper as a dark horror-like vaudeville/musical artist. So the songs are shaped very much like songs in a musical, with lots of parts, lasting longer than the usual three-minute hit song. A musical, yes, but keep in mind, an Alice Cooper musical that is.<br />The guest appearance by Vincent Price is, you guessed it, priceless. He certainly adds an extra dimension to the whole idea of this album. Don't know who Vincent Price is? Google him. It is well worth your time. I guarantee it.<br />So who would I recommend this album to? Anyone who likes rock and grew up in the the seventies,and everyone who is curious about it. This is a very seventies, beautiful,very entertaining, hell-of-a-ride kind of an album. It deserves to be ranked up there among the great must-have rock albums.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I was looking for a cover that would also work as a stand.  This is exactly what I wanted. Works great, easy to use and kindle is secure at all times.
B001AEF6C2|5.0|Brand new and in great quality too! I was really impressed with the price and shipping time. Got this for my brother in law
B007IXWKUK|5.0|She did it again! Fifty shades darker had me biting my nails and hoping for more. This is great for anybody who loves romance sex and reading.
B00838HRP2|2.0|I've seen this movie, it's great, however the item I thought I purchased was NOT the item I received.  I am still waiting for a refund or an exchange.  (the movie I received is formatted for European DVD players, not USA)
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Was interesting. I really enjoyed the book. I think it is nicely written. And very intriguing. I would recommend this book.
0064431789|5.0|Came in good condition and has become my three year olds favorite bedtime story, and it was mine when I was her age as well.  Can't complain.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|As a film student I love watching special features to see how the movie is made. The only thing that would've made it better is if there were commentaries during the  movies, but I think I'm one of the only nerds on this Earth that actually watches the movie with its masterminds talking through the whole thing.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this for my dad as a birthday gift. He is entirely satisfied with it, so I must be as well.
B008133MDK|5.0|In this season of the retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic they cover some of the most famous tales, such as The Lady and The Hound.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I do not care for the carnival game, but, love this version. Definitely try it.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I used to own this for the Sega CD but after that stopped working i looked for it for other consols finally after finding this i can play it again.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this one.  We loved the way the story twisted history to make it so believeable.  Action-packed, a must-see for any zombie movie buff.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Ever feel like killing everyone on earth?  Now you can with this fun game evolve your virus or bacteria into a super killer and destroy the world.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|We had to constantly stop the movie and rewind because we laughed to the point of tears.  A great hommage to the original, but is an instant classic in its own right.  We will be purchasing this one for the collection.  Crude and stupid, its a perfect way to spend an evening lauging out loud!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Arthur Conan Doyle would be proud of how well the BBC retells his classic characters.  It is easily the best retelling I have come across.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|This is a good book to keep on hand if you have curly hair.  I bought the kindle version and was a bit surprised that I was able to read the entire book in about an hour.  I thought it would be more beefy than that and have more information.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good book.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Just got this movie - and I love it. Plenty of action and a hot sexy officer ( Rihanna) make this film worth watching<br />again and again. The battleship Missouri saves the world ( Navy Rocks).
B0041OOEJY|4.0|Good movie, although too slow in some places.  Loved the scene with the Chinese lady and the snake. Jaden Smith is adorable.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best military history books I have read.  Great insight to the German side of the war.  The fact that they were defending their country rather than the Nazi party was quite intriguing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|if you have plated where's my water and watch Phineas and ferb. u will love this game!!! it is a mix of the two but even beget than you think!! get this app!! get this app!!!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I'm new to Kindle Fire. Thought this looked like a fun little game to start.  WRONG.  It's more like a narcotic wrapped in honey.  No wonder so many were addicted.  I'll never make all the levels, but when playing with the birds you certainly forget any woes you might have.
0811879542|5.0|This book is so simple that is always amazes me how excited the children get when it is read to them in a classroom.<br />with all the electronic games, videos, books, and etc that the children are exposed to it makes me happy when something so simple, yet beautiful makes them laugh.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love  your books I am looking forward to a other books that you have made thanks for the books
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; good.  This is a type of story where you simply cannot put it down.  The writing is fantastic and there are twists and turns from the beginning to the end.  The character development was phenomenal and I am now a huge fan of Flynn's work. If you want a thriller with a humourous vibe, this is a must read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book I recommend this to all young readers another excellent book in the trilogy and good laugh
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This novel was a great read from beginning to end.  It had many twists and turns and when I read this as a young adult I was sucked into the controversial plot. If you are a person who loves a emotional young adult lit, this is a good book.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A good book. Even if it is a child's book, nonetheless a good novel. I enjoyed it and I loved it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is exciting and the writing is truly a great level of quality. I would highly recommend this to other people looking for something from a different angle and with a magical touch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book!! Granted it got a little inappropriate at times, but I liked the openness of it all. You were daring...and it paid off!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Spielberg at his best. Picture and sound quality are amazing. While the fourth movie may not be the best, it still is a pretty darn good movie.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like this product. It works reliably. I'd give it five stars, but it's a bit clumsy to use; maybe it has too many options.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game to play when you want to pass the time . A bonus is that the daily rewards are so high so you're not waiting forever for money.
1934030597|5.0|I know some great guys that work at bike shops.  But you can't beat knowing how to do it all yourself.  The first time I used this book to fix a shifting issue, it paid for itself.  Saved myself a trip to the shop, and the cost & wait of having someone else do it.  If you own a mountain bike, buy this book.<br /><br />Knowing what's going on with your bike will also make you a better rider!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Im not usually into hip hop but this album is amazing! Thrift shop is a super catchy track! There are other gems such as neon cathedral and same love. Good beats and amazing lyrics!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I'm a little late in jumping on the Angry Birds bandwagon.  However, I had a 99 cent credit from Amazon and wanted to use it on a tried and true game which works as expected on my Kindle 7&#34; HD.  Well it does, ad free and there looks to be a ton of levels to keep me busy for a long time.  I love using the birds to tear stuff up and pop the piggies.  The crashing sound effects are great and smashing glass, rocks and boards is a great release.<br /><br />No problems and a great bargain for 99 cents.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was sad.  I enjoy all Nicholas Sparks books so I still gab  it a 5.  I loved the characters.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great story! Lots of twist and turns. I enjoyed reading this book very much. I will look for more books by the author.
B007885IJU|5.0|My favorite album of late 2012/ 2013. Each song is unique- this will appeal to a wide audience without being \\"pop\\" music. I love all of the songs. They are talented and original. Very catchy music, upbeat and fun. And they are easy on the eyes too! Crisp and clean music, heartfelt, and great voices, I love this group.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|To be honest, there were moments in this movie that I was rolling my eyes. I was not completely wowed by the way Catwoman was put into the story. Interesting? Yes. But something about he relationship Bruce made her seem more like she could have fulfilled the role of Bat-Girl as well.<br /><br />All that aside, Bane is an impressive villian, not just for size and appearance, but his creepy voice and his smart tactics. He is someone you can come to appreciate and understand for a villian, even if you're still rooting for Batman the whole time.<br /><br />The movie tied back into the 1st one more than anything, as if the 2nd movie had been skipped...but that is what helped it close out the series well. Batman finding himself back in another pit that he has to get out of - a somewhat &#34;duh&#34; idea but it worked well, artistically.<br /><br />The scenery and mood for this movie are probably the most impressive and touching of all the movies - and Batman certainly is presented with a number of tough situations just in trying to get to Bane. And - hint - Batman still makes some mistakes that make the ending a bit of a shocker.<br /><br />Weeks later I still want to watch this again, and again...sometimes just for the scenes with Bane!
B009H442DG|5.0|When listening to their Christmas CD I was really glad I bought it. I received the cd right away. I could see the 2 singing and having a good time too.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Went to play after fresh install. Full page ad pops up and obscures gameplay. I guess one has to click on an ad (because as a married person, I am really interested in match.com?) in order to proceed. Had a better idea, uninstalled it. If you don't want to offer the app for free, then don't.
B005USZYDU|5.0|this made the grandbaby a happy child. so much delight on christmas day. thanks for shipping in time for christmas.
B0090O07RS|5.0|Doors fans shouldn't hesitate to get this.  It is a tremendous improvement over older issues of this performance.<br />The Doors sound engineer, Bruce Botnick, is something of a master in his field.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|these made the grandbaby a happy child. so much delight on christmas day. thanks for shipping in time for christmas.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I use this app frequently now. I think it may have some features that I have not figured out how to use. It initially had me enter zip codes to pick out other places that I wanted to see weather for but I have not figured out how to access that feature.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the series. It ties in a lot of mysteries throughout the movie collection.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was simply amazing. I wish the series kept going and going. I will be waiting for the next installment!
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is great for showing a life experience with a little comedy. I enjoy the actors in this movie.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Really enjoy this Cd.  The killers know how to deliver good quality music and this Cd does not dissappoint.  Highly recommend.
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|I saw her tour live, which was amazing. Getting this Blu-ray helped me relive it, and all its greatness. Really great!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, and love all in one day. Literally, a day because I couldn't put it down. I continue to look back on parts I loved, especially the poems and musical references. What I expected was a light read but was surprised by how much emotion an enjoyable book can bring to what I thought was going to be a lazy Sunday!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This is the perfect movie to the Bourne series. It ties everything in, and it adds a new twist to it all. I really think it could match up to bond.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|So with everyone saying that mc4 is not comparable to mc3, I guess I need to prove it to you guys that it is in fact better than the previous modern combat.<br /><br />Campain- Continuing the mc3 story, you play on both sides of the fray. You will reconize several characters from mc3. But the gameplay is noticeably different. The graphics are much better looking and the lighting, sound, and cutscenes are better than ever. The time is somewhere around 2020, a little futuristic. But everything seems better than mc3. Now lets move on to the more important part.<br /><br />Multiplayer- Here is where the big changes have been made, so many that I will breifly summarize each of them.<br /><br />1) New perm's system, that has 4 specific classes each with there own set of perks.<br /><br />2) All new weapons, only weapon that are not the same are the grenades and launchers.<br /><br />3) New and larger maps, all with unique features and stuff.<br /><br />4) Much easier leveling up, making it seem like your actually making progress.<br /><br />5) All guns are always avalible, but you need lots of coins for even cheap one. There will always be something on sale though.<br /><br />6) You need to buy everything.<br /><br />7) Much more social attached. You can access facebook, twitter, and gameloft live right from the game.<br /><br />8) Friends leaderboard. Keep track of how well you are doing compared to your friends.<br /><br />That's all I can think of now. I definerly recommend this game.<br /><br />PS. There are now ragdoll physics and smart moving implemented into the game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Watched the movie hunger games, and found it to be entertaining, and wanted to continue on the journey. I thought cathing fire was a good follow up, and looking forward to Mockingjay.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I got it for my family and now a lot of people aroind us are thinking about getting a copy, because it is an awesome album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just when I think I'm done something happens to keep me going. This makes this game not only last but makes it funner.
1423136802|5.0|A really nice edition, easy to handle, and the price was awesome. I really enjoyed been able to read the whole collection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's so much fun, my husband and I  play it together.<br /> I don't care for the war games etc. but I love the simple little birds and piggies.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Awesome web series, with subtitles in a lot of languages, full of juicy extras and no region lock.<br /><br />I wish more DVD/Bluray editions would be like this. They would probably sell more copies.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love Boardwalk Empire.  It has such a great cast and the story is so impressive.  I chose it because my wife and I loved to watch it together.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is a fun game. Wish you got more than 5 lives at a play though, that makes playing time shorter if you're not really good at the game.
B0000261RJ|5.0|If you are a true DIo fan you gotta have this..All the tracks are up to his rigid standards...Excellent CD for the money
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend reading these books to any one! I loved it! It was super good. Couldn't stop reading this book!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's was so good. Kinda creepy and sad but it was so heart touching. Like everyone can relate to Charlie one way or another. Through his thoughts or actions. but a very well told story
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this album to play in the background during my Christmas party.<br />Was perfect.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  Michael Buble made Christmas that much more special.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I did not think I would like this game.  I thought it would be boring.  I love word games like Boggle, Scrabble, Words with Friends, etc.  This sounded soooooooo boring.  I could not have been more wrong.  This game is so much fun.  I like that it is actually challenging.  I like the ability to interact with other people via the chat bar.  I like that it gives you choices of words to draw at different challenge levels for different amounts of points.  I like that you can choose to play against your friends or a random player is chosen for you.  I like that the number of letters is provided and there are a choice of letters given to choose from.  I like that you can &#34;bomb&#34; some of the letters away when you get stuck.  I also like that it saves your games and if you have to stp away from them, you can come back to them whenever you have time.  Love, love, love this game.  Fun and challenging.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the third book!!! What a cliff hanger.<br />Excellent writing and such a captivating story! Highly recommend!
1455519006|2.0|Granted, as a former Green Beret, my standards of verisimilitude might be a tad higher than the average reader's, but is it really too much to expect the writer of a book about a hit man to know the difference between a bullet and a casing? In one sequence, he has the protagonist explaining that he usually \\"polices his brass\\", but that he can't after this hit, because he's using dum-dums, so the bullet will stay inside the victim!  Granted, authors of thrillers often know little about weapons. They are constantly confusing pistols with revolvers, or making silly mistakes like putting sound supressors (AKA \\"silencers\\") on revolvers, but give a break: not even knowing how a bullet is constructed? The action sequences are just as unrealistic: most of them are downright clownish. You'd think he'd get someone with a modicum of police or military experience to read the manuscript and point out the most obvious gaffes. I've never been impressed with his writing in the past, but I liked the premise so I got this from the library. Good thing, too: I'd hate to pay money for this kind of lazy, unprofessional hack writing.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I usually love all the Resident Evil pics but the last two have been so far off the mark with zombies who have things coming out of their mouths to the new ones who drive cars!!  Oh no what will be next....a zombie who runs for president?  Oh wait-we already have one!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|I gave it 2 stars for the special effects but the story was absolutely terrible.  Not worth the time even if you are a big Alien fan.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Not a collectors item like others have said and not many extras, but still, 8 blue rays for this cheap is great.  I didn't want to spend $300 plus on the one with all the extras and nice case.<br /><br />After I purchased this I saw reviews on this product about a cheaper set from the UK that had more features.  So if I were you I'd check that one out.  Just look through these comments, I'm sure you will find it.
B00A25NLOU|3.0|Premise was great then it went wrong. I am sorry but about midway, it lost me and I ceased to care.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|Bought for my BF.  He really loves Mad Max.  Figured I'd just go with the blueray-DVD combo since the price wasn't bad.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I've had this album for over a year and I still listen to it. Nary a song on here that I don't like.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|my son and wife absolutely loved this movie, of course we are big fans of hugh jackman anyways, great movie.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Very creative.  This is one of those movies you could watch twice and still pick up something new.  The kids loved it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! Its a fun action game and is fun when you die! I love to change the characters and play everyday!
B002VXGW2E|4.0|I really liked this movie. It was fun to watch Meryl Steep play Julia Childs settle into Paris and learn to cook. It was also fun to watch Julie learn to cook, creating the more notable recipes in one year. It was just a fun relaxing movie so I picked a rating of 4 Stars. I agree with some comments that the Julia Childs side of the movie, could have been a movie unto itself, espcially with Meryl Streep and Stan Tucci playing the roles. I thought they were both great, just as in &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34;. Not too much I didn't like about the movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Its a fun game that helps you to think about what you need to build plus I have always loved angry birds!
B000002W9Q|3.0|This album has a bunch of tunes from the movie that are mostly well mixed.  Mostly they are not to my taste, but the one song I was really looking forward to was the #1 track \\"The Time of My Life\\".  Sadly, the remarkable singing of Jennifer Warren and Bill Medley ends up backing the remarkably uninspired snare drum of some anonymous session musician with his girlfriend on the maracas.<br /><br />The rest of the songs seem to be recorded with more balance.<br /><br />I recommend not buying this if your main interest is in track 1
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love being able to hatch dragons and take care of them! It gives me something to look forward to when I get home!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Unconditional love is what Katie and Alex have, even though she was still married and her husband abused her he still accepted her for who she is. This is truly a heart touching love story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun and funny game! It funny when you hit the trains or the guy carrys you away! Love it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great story. Can,t wait for the next one.<br /><br />Which guy will she pick. Can't wait to find out.<br /><br />Number three, let,s go.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Its a fun classic game that has been around for years! It brings back memories full of cheer! Its the perfect game to play after school!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I think the series has gone down hill a tad.  Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a bad movie, my opinion is relative to the series as a whole.  Great action, great cinematography, okay story.  Worth the purchase.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It helps me practice my chess and it gives me a reason to get out of chores! I love chess and hope to teach it one day!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good, I couldn't put it down. Recommend to anyone, all ages. Hopeless was a great read.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I've been hooked on this game since I first got it. Very fun, yet challenging. My 9-year old had enjoyed it on a simpler level, but there are more complicated nuances that make the game interesting for us grownups, too.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Nevosoft always has great hidden objects games and this one continues that same track record. My only objection is that the storyline is too wordy. I would prefer less dialogue and more scenes.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|The only complaint I have about Unorthodox Jukebox is that the \\"Young Girls\\" track is different from the way he sang it on SNL.  That was magical!!!  Bruno in the white spotlight and blue background wearing his hat and shades, brothers singing background with the harmony blending with Bruno's voice was so tight you couldn't cut it with a knife.  The strings and keyboards providing the beautiful music was hypnotic.  I had to buy that episode of SNL so I could have that version of \\"Young Girls.\\"  Worth every penny.  Bruno is an amazing performer and I am buying all of his music.  I have them on my computer - now I will have him in my car.  He travels very well.  One more thing - \\"Gorilla\\" - HOT!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn sure has written a great novel.  This one kept me guessing until the final page.  It's a book you can't put down.  I've recommended it to all my friends, and they loved it too.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is the original and far better than the current remake. The quality of the image is wonderful considering how long ago the movie was made, but the story and acting is superb. Don't waste your money on the new version.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a heart warming book. Sparks really know how to write. I'm so glad I took time to read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this stroy and I couldn't put it down. I found the main character Sky to be very brave and strong. At the begining of the story you are introduced to her very best friend Six. I loved Six I just  wish she was in the story more. I loved how Holder came into the story as well. At first you werent sure what to make of him. Holder  was very hard to figure out.  As the story unfolded  you understood him and why he acted the way he did. Holder says things that just simply take your breath away! I really enjoyed the story and if you have read any of Colleen Hoover's other storys you will not be disapointed. If you havent read any of her storys start with Hopless and then you need to read Slammed and Point Of No Retreat. I have loved all of her books so far. I highly recommend this story!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a great read and hard to put down. So many emotions involved.  Ended the book sobbing and wiping away tears. Can't wait to see the movie now.
B007ZVSHR0|5.0|The album is full of fun upbeat dance songs on the first half and then it slows for some amazing rock ballads! Best thing I've purchase all year!
0741470314|5.0|Thx so much for this wonderful book Karen and for given a exempare to our Heal the Children Fundraising Campaign inspired by Michael Jackson. love from Sandra - MJJ Memorial Munich - Heal the Children Org
B008IGP8RI|4.0|Good music, but a soundtrack often doesn't have the coherence of an album. Ralph Stanley doing Lou Reed is a highlight.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a laugh out loud and clings to the real myths. I love this book and hope you do to
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I liked the acting.  It's a believable story.  One can only hope &#34;Taken 2&#34; is as good as this one!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is the best movie from 2012.  If you are looking something incredibly funny...this is it.  The one liners are phenomenal!!<br /><br />You MUST love music to watch this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got a Kindle for Christmas and was looking for a good book to read. I usually read true crime but was looking for something lighter. With 5 stars and over 1000 readers I downloaded the sample and couldn't stop till I finished.  Loved this book.
B005S9EK1S|1.0|I love this movie and bought the blu-ray version so I could have two copies of it.  Unfortunately I didn't realize unlike most Blu-ray movies you purchase it only came with the Blu-ray movie version.  I wanted it to watch in my kitchen but that player is just a basic one and won't play this movie.  :(
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I dont need to rate thie movie as its already a big block buster and all time best batman movie.<br />Today I am rating the amazon prime video. Quality is good and renting for 48 hours is the best option.  Its easy way to rent movies online.<br /><br />Sub- titles are not available
0307463745|5.0|Rework changed my life - there, I said it. The concepts found in this book radically changed the way I think about work and business. I was fortunate enough to read this book during the summer after I graduated from college while looking for my first \\"big-kid\\" job. Suffice to say, if you work, or are planning on working in any capacity, read this book. It's that good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I frequently need a calculator, and carry one with me, but that one is never where I need one. My Fire is usually in hand or next to it. This app works great, is easy to use, and right where I need it. Free as well, which makes it a 5 STAR little app!<br />It's well worth your time to install it...
B000FC1HBY|1.0|I made it through the book and it was boring even to the end.<br />Not nearly as good as the first book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The way it is packaged is great. You pull a &#34;book&#34; out of the cover and for each DVD there is a sleeve of graphics from that movie.  Good pick!
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|The Smith family live in a panties optional trailer park. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a young coke dealer who is in hock for $6,000 for 2 ounces that was fronted to him and apparently stolen by his mom. Okay I know that is too much for 2 oz. and no one fronts drugs, but go with it. His equally slow witted dad (Thomas Haden Church) lives there as well as his step mom (Gina Gershon). To round out the group is their dog Tebow and child-like sister Dottie (Juno Temple) who reminded me of the Hillbilly Ninja (Google it) in one scene.<br /><br />Chris believes his real mom, who he suspects stole from him, has a $50,000 life insurance policy and names the half witted Dottie as the beneficiary. Their plan is to hire \\"Killer Joe\\" (Matthew McConaughey)a Dallas detective who moonlights as a gun for hire. Without the up front money, Joe takes Dottie as a \\"retainer\\" to the ire of Chris who perhaps loves his sister a little too much. This provides us with a very erotic scene between Juno and McConaughey.<br /><br />There of course is a problem with the expected twist, and another twist thrown in just in case you thought you were clever, although there are clues that most of us would ignore. The opening sound track lets you know this is a grindhouse style movie. Plenty of sex, nudity, and bloody violence. Clearly not for everyone. Good accents.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, full frontal nudity (Juno Temple, Gina Gershon or body double, uncredited strippers) Blood, violence, killing, violence to women.
B000ZI8E5K|5.0|I think this book is great day to day reading material..... and if the methods are applied accordingly..... it will change your life... As it did mine forever....
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|For a free app, this is really a good one. Lots of layouts and auto shuffle when you're out of moves. Only suggestions are to lose the layouts that make the tiles really small and hard to see/touch the right one...also, make the music a toggle option on the main screen because it gets old. Otherwise, a great, addictive free game. Thanks!
B007XF0X6G|4.0|My 3d DVD purchases come slow, as the price for 3d DVD is usually more.  I watched this, it is a good DVD, 3d Works well.  I also have Clash of the Titan in 3d
B009LXEBD4|5.0|If you like her mainstream songs, and her chart hits, then you will enjoy this entire CD.  Although there is one Christmas song, this is a great addition to the casual fan's collection.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I have watched this on a  3d HDTV, worth the view since, so much of the dvd is animated anyway (which works better in 3D)<br /><br />Worth the 3d Content if you like the movie.

0140187863|3.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover is Lawrence's final novel before his untimely death from tuberculosis at the age of 44, and like every one of his works it follows these same familiar themes: the renunciation of the body in favor of the intellect, epitomized by the wheelchair-bound Clifford (Lord Chatterley) and his unconsummated marriage to Connie. Predictably, then, the novel unfolds Connie's physical flowering, awoken by an initial affair with the populist Irish playwright Michaelis, who fails to satisfy her, and eventually by Oliver Mellors, the local gamekeeper, the lover of the title.<br /><br />It startles me that I have to give this book such a low rating, since I have at least liked, if not loved, almost everything else I have read by Lawrence. Women in Love, in particular, I consider to be one of the greatest novels of the English canon. But Lady Chatterley's Lover pales in comparison to that earlier work. The central reason is that Lawrence provides a cast that is too didactic and one-sided for its own good. The reader is never in any doubt that our sympathies are supposed to lie with Connie and Mellors, with Clifford presented as a fairly straightforward petty tyrant whose sterile emotional and intellectual life cannot make up for his obvious physical limitations. Sorely missing is a character like Gerald Crich (from Women in Love) who, despite repeatedly being in the \\"wrong\\" in terms of Lawrence's philosophy, nonetheless possesses a robust physical presence and energy that lends nuance and ambiguity to his character, making him a worthy counterbalance to Rupert Birkin's role as Lawrence's mouthpiece. In Lady Chatterley's Lover, by contrast, Lawrence fails to give voice to the kind of self-criticism that adds depth and credibility to his other works of fiction.<br /><br />It was because of this lopsidedness in the narrative perspective that I constantly felt in a rebellious mood against the novel's point of view. Connie is supposed to be the sympathetic core of the book, but while I understood her reservations well enough, I couldn't identify with many of her actions. Unlike her Victorian predecessors, this adulteress was not stuck in her marriage to Clifford: she could have walked away at any time, having both the financial means and the legal ability to do so. Instead, she prefers sanctimoniously to torture Clifford from a sense of revenge that completely undermined any sympathy I might have had for her. Sure, Clifford was a mistake and a boor, but Connie's cruelty to him is selfish, immature, and ultimately unwarranted. Her sadistic fantasy of passing off another man's child for him to raise is probably the nadir of her character.<br /><br />Ultimately, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a failure not only for its shrill one-sidedness, but because it fails to extend Lawrence's philosophy in any meaningful way. Certainly the language and sex scenes are more explicit, overlaid as they are with the usual Lawrentian jargon that makes them sound strange and outdated to readers not used to his metaphors, but the whole story is haunted by a sense that we have seen it all before: Mellors, in particular, might be Paul Morel, the protagonist of Sons and Lovers, some twenty years later. The philosophical discussions, similarly, feature an array of forgettable characters who pop up and then disappear without adding anything new to what Lawrence has said before. But what irked me the most was Connie's newfound desire for a child as the symbol of her hope for a better world. This conclusion I found to be the worst kind of emotional blackmail, one that implies that the decision not to have children is an indicator of despair and a renunciation of life.<br /><br />There are times when I have thought, like a young Nicholas Urfe in John Fowles's novel The Magus, that Lawrence was the greatest, most splendid human being of the twentieth century. There is certainly plenty of wisdom and insight in his diagnosis of the underlying problems of modern humanity. But then there are other times, such as when reading Lady Chatterley's Lover, that I find myself unable to follow him any further, not because I have come to a fundamental disagreement with his ideas, but because the terms on which they are offered are no longer acceptable.umanity.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I have had this for a few months now and I am very happy with this product.  I hate to carry around CD's and I don't have a MP3 plug for my stereo, so this was the next best thing.  I live in a fairly small area, so its not to hard to find a station that is not being used.  I could see this not working as well in a bigger city with a lot of stations filling up the air waves.  But for me its been great.  It come in really clear and has a powerful broadcast signal.  I tested it by turning it on in one car then driving another car down the street, and to my surprise, the signal went about 100ft away be for losing its signal.  Great product, I'm very pleased.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Bought it as a Christmas present for my sister; she loved it.<br />*It arrived within a few days after purchasing.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He is a BIG Indiana Jones fan and really likes this series.  Now he gets to watch it in HD Blu-Ray and he couldn't be happier. A must have for all you Indi fans.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|A very well done series - rather a British soap opera as far as content, but the acting is outstanding with great character development.  Maggie Smith is fabulous!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm a big Batman fan and I couldn't wait to get this trilogy on Blu-ray.  I pre-ordered it a month in advance as to get the lowest price, and I could not be happier.  Its a must have for any Batman fan, and it has a lot of extra features.  You will not be disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. could not put my kindle down until it was done. literally. the way the main character, sky, narrates the book got me hooked. Shes funny and real, relatable characters make you able to get lost in a story and I did just that. and holder?! ugh. just amazing<3
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Not the greatest of literature but she is a wonderful story teller.  She keeps you glued to the pages.  I was born just at the end of world war ll so I identify so much with the timing of the novel
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love all of the Jack Reacher books. I am excited to see the movie. Once I picked up that first book I was hooked.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|Just started opening and listening to this Box set. The Abbey Road lp was open. The shrink wrap on the album had actually been opened and the album has a thumb print on it. Also came in a white sleeve, where the other albums have  nice black sleeves. I think they should of put all the albums on the Apple label, or else the Parlophone label. Also the Past Masters LP has the first album on Parlophone and the second album on Apple. It feels like a mixed bag, and for the price, it could of been better packaged. That said the Book is beautiful! Since I have now bought The Beatles Box set for a second time, Got the Itunes set on Mp4. Hope I don't have a need to buy again, but would love to see the Capital Albums remastered for vinyl..
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It arrives on time, the picture needs to be a Christmas gift and it was, the price was excelent and i am very pleased with the product
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Best yet for The Darkness!  Can't wait to see them in concert rocking out Every Inch of You!  Every song is a concrete jungle of fun...must buy for any music lover!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My kind of book.  Much death and destruction.  I plan to read more of Jack's adventures.  I like when good over comes bad in the end.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I love the concept of getting the acting and singing performances for this great musical \\"raw\\". I think they pulled it off in every respect, except in the case of Russell Crowe. His performance was like finger nails on a chalkboard, almost.<br />Every time the movie has nearly recovered from his last number, there he is again to kill it fresh.<br />I know that, as a point of pride, they won't consider overdubbing him before the Blu-ray comes out, but I sure wish they would...
B000FCK65W|5.0|this is an old book that I wanted to read for a long time. I really enjoyed it even tho the heroine was so dicriminated against.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, although sometimes I had a hard time following all the characters. I did like it though and was glad I read it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I am an avid Grisham fan and this did not disappoint. I thought it was great even though it had a bit of a twist for Grisham. I was going through a situation similar to the lawyer in this book so I especially related to how he was feeling. The book hit home for me at the perfect time. But that aside I would recommend to any Grisham fans.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Good movie.  Nothing great.  Great bicycle riding scenes.  Plot is weak.  Quality was very good.  Something a little bit different from what's out there.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|Hardly worth your time when part of your time is spent declining up-grade offers and there are very few scenes actually given to you to play. A good tease at best.
B0086700CM|5.0|everyone out there should try this best best best game I know you will love love love this awesome game
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Maybe two funny parts in the whole thing. I wouldn't watch it again and feel like it was a waste of money.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love this author...this book is no exception!  Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys mystery and psychological thrillers.  Definitely a must read!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Read a lot of his book and they are action packed.  I will continue until I finish all his books.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|*Update*:<br /><br />The game runs great on a Kindle Fire HDX.  If you bought, played, and abandoned this game on the Kindle Fire HD, try it on your HDX and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The HDX's beefier and more powerful processor and GPU runs all animations smoothly and with ease.  I finally get to enjoy my purchase!<br /><br />*Original review for those with a Fire HD*:<br /><br />I don't know where they get off tagging it with \\"Kindle Tablet Edition\\" when it runs so poorly on a Kindle Fire HD.  There is constant lag with all of the animations which makes the game near unplayable.  I have played PQ2 on both the PC and DS, and did not experience any of these issues.  I'm guessing that other than a few cosmetic tweaks and control adjustments, the game engine was not recoded or optimized at all for the Kindle hardware.  I'd recommend saving your money and then purchasing this great game on another platform or device.

B000IZA9NK|5.0|The script is campy and perfectly executed. Kerry Conran's vision is mind-blowing. All the charm of a 40s action adventure, but with incredible special effects. And apart from all that, the story is very good!
B000P407K4|2.0|Cost too much for such an old movie. This could have been a rental. We will be less likely to choose Amazon video in the future.

Seller shipped fast and I am so glad I broke down and bought this for myself. Wish they would have made it to Missouri on their last tour as I would have loved to have seen their concert...hopefully they will not be in hiding for as long between concerts and will visit the midwest next time!!

B003O6R2DK|5.0|I'm giving this album five stars, as I believe there is enough goodness here to justify calling it a must-have purchase for &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; fans. That said, it is missing a couple of important things.<br /><br />While the album includes three beautiful, iconic recordings by Julee Cruise, including &#34;Falling,&#34; the vocal version of the &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; theme song, it is missing &#34;Rockin' Back Inside My Heart,&#34; one of my favorite of her tracks created for the show. I have no idea why this track isn't included on this album, but thankfully Amazon does seem to sell it as a stand-alone mp3.<br /><br />Secondly, I can't fathom why &#34;Sycamore Trees&#34; performed by Little Jimmy Scott does not appear on this album. Well, maybe I can understand it: they made a follow-up soundtrack, seemingly dedicated to Season 2, and it was in the last episode of the series that &#34;Sycamore Trees&#34; was played. However, it's not on the Season 2 Soundtrack album either! If you want to find it, &#34;Sycamore Trees&#34; can be heard on the &#34;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me&#34; movie soundtrack. I have no idea why it's there, as I can't even recall the song being played in the film whatsoever. Still, all's well that ends well; I'm happy that it can be purchased online at all, even if it doesn't show up on the album where you'd expect to find it.<br /><br />Those minor gripes aside, this is a fantastic album, showcasing some of the best of Angelo Badalamenti's score and, as previously mentioned, three gorgeous vocal tracks by Julee Cruise. All of the familiar themes are there, from the &#34;Twin Peaks Theme&#34; itself to the haunting &#34;Dance of the Dream Man.&#34;<br /><br />I've got good news: this music you like will never go out of style. Let's rock!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the series, It is on of those books that once you start you can't put down. It make you want more and more of the Shades Series.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|This movie was very strange and didn't really appeal to my son. Some parts were funny, but overall not a good animation movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game love playing it all day.  So realistic and enjoy all the quests and problems they create for you.  WOW!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I saw all three previous Bournes and this one was disappointing. I expected more action and the chase scene was too long.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This was a very good book well i have  read all of them now and i hope they make a next one!!!!
1449433251|5.0|Calvin & Hobbes is one of most incredible comics that I ve ever seen, This package is awesome for all their fans like me. Thank you Wattersson and the introduction is the best of all previous books
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book because everybody said the movie was good. I ended up not being able go put it down. It sucked me in. I think everybody can relate to Charlie and Sam an  Patrick. I loved the part when Sam helped Charlie realize that he needed to actually do things and not be a wallflower. That part was kind of an apiphany for myself too. I loved, loved, loved, this book. Everybody can feel infinite.
B0091REZMW|4.0|entertaining game if you like looking for hidden objects. good game. waiting for energy is the only part of the game thatsno fun. I enjoy it.
B0051XQI84|5.0|Watched this with the grandkids. We all enjoyed it. No subtitles, so my hard of hearing wife could not watch it.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Great present to give to my family friends from out of state ... considering that i&#34;The Town&#34; is where I grew up!
B004DM0UII|5.0|App as good as satellite radio.  Listen to your favorite music without commercials.  The free price at Amazon did not hurt either.  The only problem I encountered was that I could not download the same app to my Samsung Galaxy S phone and my Samsung Note 10.1 concurrently.
B002ZDOXM6|4.0|The CD was ok, this is a toned down version of what I was hoping for in this CD .. I like the BSB - so for me .. it was  still okay
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This series is addicting. Although I was not as keen on the Fae part at first, it kind of grew on me due to the implications for other parts.. I' m looking forward to the next book.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I am now up to date with all 4 seasons of the Sons and am waiting for season five to come out.  Amazon never not delivers quality merchandise in the time frame promised. Great job as always.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I LOVE this!  This was a quick and easy way to upload all the Twilight Saga books into my kindle.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|After getting hooked with season one I had to purchase season two.  The writing and style of this series is ahead of its time.  It is the Godfather of motorcycle drama.  I cannot get enough of it.  Every actoir brings something unique to his or her role.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Django unchained is similar to Inglorious in that it retains the entertaining if unashamedly ignorant nature of the latter. However, where it falls short of Inglorious is in its reliance on just 4, static, characters to drive a \\"single\\" plot (Basterds had two divergent plots and although many of its characters were static, it had a lot more of them. Though some may argue that there were one too many) , something which, considering the length of the movie, wears a bit thin towards the end. Despite this, all the characters are well done and are very well acted with Samuel L Jackson's character proving to be the most interesting of the four (his style reminded me a bit of Grima from the Two Towers).
B00000DG1R|5.0|next you will want to buy a Dvd of all their old MTV videos!<br /><br />Great compilation for a great price!
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book is one of the best books in the world I want to read is next book the house of Hades I can't wait for it just can't
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I heard this all summer long- and never got sick of it.  It will now always remind me of the summer of 2012.
1401937519|4.0|I love Anita's story about life after death, and healing in this life. I think it is extraordinary. I am telling loads of people about this. I just wish you didn't write the word cancer so many times, as I believe that we become what we think. But the essence of the story is wonderful and inspiring.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Good luck finding any artist or group putting every song hit on one cd - it just doesn't happen.<br />But if you want to buy a Cd with a lot of Michael's hits- you cannot go wrong with this selection.<br />Pricing was very fair.
B004J64QSI|5.0|OK, Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were good, but this video will put it all in perspective. Alfie Boe is great here - possibly the best Jean Valjean ever. And Lea Salonga is always good. The rest of the cast is excellent too.  Definitely a must buy.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This CD is good but not as good as I had hoped. Brought it for one song though so mission was accomplished.
B008J344BQ|5.0|My daughters can sing along with me to all songs. It is a wonderful buy! It is constantly playing in my car.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|It is not a straight forward movie and the ending was suprising. Very entertaining from beginning to end. It is kind of depressing though so keep that in mind. This is a must see.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The classic game for free in all different patterns. Lots of fun, helps pass the time especially at doctors appointments!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I downloaded this from the Tubemate site, and I've tried to use it to download several different videos. It would not download any of them. There are apparently no instructions on how to use the app, so there's nowhere to go from here. I realize that some people have recently had good luck with this app, but it apparently suffers from the \\"frequent update\\" problem, and the updates often destroy the usefulness of the app. At present, it's a big waste of time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a entertaining game. All the different levels are amazing. Cut the Rope is just freaking awesome!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I like it as soon as I seen it. When I received I really enjoyed because no one cell phone can be in a table, but this product helped me to do. ALso I can take panoramic photos mounted in a Tripod. I liked the idea that you can separate the holder from the mini tripod.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It show excellent writing skill and I enjoyed reading the book and it kept my interest throughout the book. Castle season 1,2,3, was enjoyable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have been using this free app since I received my Kindle Fire HD in November. I love the fact that it shows me exactly the amount of battery life I have left along with additional helpful data. I have experienced absolutely no problems with this free app and would highly recommend it to other owners of the Kindle Fire HD. This is one of my favorite apps and would consider upgrading to the Pro version but I have everything I need with the free version.  All advertisements are so small that they are almost invisible and cause no interference whatsoever with the app.  I love this app!
1401324029|4.0|I like good writing, get you involved in the story. Can'y wait to read the next book and see how you continue the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book for any girl/ woman to read. It is one of the best books I've read in a while it has the perfect amount of love and heartbreak in it all at the same time. It take turns that you would never expect! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
1401323820|5.0|All of the Heat books are good.  I hope you will continue to write more Heat's books.  Let me know if more to come.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I was up late hoping I would finish. I was constantly reading it when I had the chance.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Sorry I bought it; sorry I read it. Will delete it from my kindle as soon as I figure out how.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|It came in the mail faster than I thought it would and the movie looks amazing! So happy with my order!
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Fair. People apparently don't know what good sound, sounds like. Too much misc. &#34;collector&#34; BS in the package too. I'd sure like to return it!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The USB port was crushed due to bad packaging. But I guess that's what I get for buying it used.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A great story.  I chose this book because of the movie promotion.  It was hard to put down. Descriptions were quite complicated in places (On the lifeboat).  I liked the story of Pi's early  religious experiences  and how he overcame the threat of the tiger by feeding it and controlled it by being dominant.
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|I Loved it!  Paints a great picture of how the struggle starts so you can place into context the games.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|We have all the Step up movies, my daughter is a dancer and she loves these movies, we see them over and over again.  Oh well, keeps her happy right?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was inspired to read the books after watching the show and I couldn't be happier. Even though I knew the outcome it did not diminish my pleasure in the least. On the contrary, I find that it enhanced it. I was able to put faces to names and learned so much that was not included in the show or was not given its proper coverage. If you enjoyed the show you must read this book. It is known.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game wont download. I have it for my Kindle Fire and it would download all the way to 12, freeze and then restart. I am extremely mad. I would highly reccomend that you do not get this game!
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Everyone should see this! This is the greatest rock band ever, and the concert lived up to all expectations indeed.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I loved this show and thought the ending was great. The only complaint I have is that I wish there would have been more about the lives of Jenny and Eric.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|While I feel that Hugo could and should have made his prose more succinct, his writing is largely inspired and his social and political commentary is surprisingly still apropos.  This translation seems to capture the spirit of the age and writer while remaining readable - not always an easy task. If you are interested in reading an unabridged version, I highly recommend this. If you are looking for a page-turner, I suggest you find a good abridged version.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Though this is not like the original Oregon Trail it is mighty fun! More like a FarmVille, this game has you build your homestead, rather than travel the trail. Hey, for a free game. you can't go wrong.
0140157352|5.0|Now if it would only work when trying to negotiate with someone under the age of 6; like grandchildren. Recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great insight made you really feel inside the story .  Will definitely try out the next in this great authors books.
B008518MOW|5.0|great movie. I have 3D and love all the 3D movies any way. This was a fun ride. But nothing like number 1 MIB
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Of course what movie with Johnny Depp in it that isn't a great movie. The man is fantastic at bringing his roles to life. I had seen the remake of the show and I have watched the original. The Movie was a nice adaptation of the original.
B009JBZH54|4.0|good movie although I like the older batman better. This was a little wishy washy. especially dark knight rises although the action was good
0891349553|5.0|I am enjoying learning how to use polymer clay and this book has some adorable animals to inspire me to make.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I love this book! It's quirky, with unexpected twists  and delightful and a fun read. Beyond entertaining. I highly recommend it.
0823015033|5.0|I can only hope to get good enough with polymer clay to make these lovely sculptures. It is nice to look at the pictures.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Typical Tom Cruise movie with terrible acting and crappy movie.  I really can't stand this guy anymore and would like to see him go away.  Maybe the Scientologists can find him a position that keeps him too busy to act anymore.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Love the movie - received in great timing and after shopping around for prices this was the best deal I found!
B005K17RU0|3.0|i was looking for an app that gives me atmospheric pressure for kindle fire  there isnt one. i will have to use my phone app for that  this app tells me the temp outside so works as advertised
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love this movie - and so does my 2 year old son!  I received the movie within great timing and after shopping around for prices this is the best price out there.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has made Lincoln and his times come alive.  I enjoyed learning about the context surrounding his famous speeches and actions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use with good sized buttons. I like it and recommend this calculator app. I haven't had any issues with anything.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Finally a movie with no sex in it!  You can watch this move with your kids.  It is a typical Clint Eastwood movie with some humor and some seriousness.  Loved Justin Timberlake in it too.  It's a &#34;feel good&#34; movie the whole family can enjoy.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was shocked how much we fit into this backpack! We have 3 cameras in there plus microphones, cables, batteries, etc. Very good design and is comfortable to carry.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a funny movie, but don't be fooled by the teddy bear on the front cover!  This is a pot smoking, sex starved teddy bear.  The movie has a nice plot to it, and it is pretty funny, (in a Cheech and Chong kind of way) but I was not prepared for how much sex and drugs was going to be in it.  I mistakenly let my 12 year old watch it before I had a chance to see it.  That was a very bad decision on my part.  I have older teenagers that had seen it in the theater, and told me it was a hilarious movie.  What they neglected to tell me was that it is inappropriate for the younger kids to watch.
B0094K1K42|1.0|The title says it all, This was just a waste of my life and my GF's life as well.. We watched the entire movie (to my regret) and with the ending I knew deep down within I would never get that hour and something back from seeing this film. Give it pass or read the other reviewers who deem this as a Horrible film. I cant be the only one who thinks this.
0307887448|3.0|I had many friends recommend READY PLAYER ONE to me. I was born in 1980. I grew up playing video games. I can quote a ton of movie references from that period. And a good bit of my ipod playlists are made up of new wave hits. You'd think I'd love this book, but no. READY PLAYER ONE by Ernest Cline was a fun read, but it didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.<br /><br />It is a fun adventure story, but the protagonist didn't make sense to me, and the plot was weak, relying on an almost literal deus ex machina several times. In the end, I think READY PLAYER ONE relies far too heavily on readers smiling and thinking \\"I get that reference,\\" while they gloss over the story's weaknesses.<br /><br />It's the story of Wade Watts, who, like many in 2044, escapes the ravaged real world by jumping into the OASIS-once an online game, now an all-immersive online experience. OASIS was founded by James Halliday, who, upon his death, reveals that he has created a hidden, three-step-puzzle based around his love of the 80s. The person who solves these puzzles will receive billions of dollars and a controlling interest in OASIS. When Wade Watts is the first to solve the first step of the puzzle, his world is turned upside down. Can Wade Watts trust his friends? Can he evade the all-powerful rival company that is racing him to the finish while also trying to kidnap or kill him?<br /><br />I won't spoil the story for you, but I will raise the following points. When people are trying to kill Wade Watts or beat him to the finish, what does he do? He spends time flirting with a girl and hanging out at parties in OASIS. He almost forgets about the contest entirely. And while I can sympathize with the passions of young love, I grew very frustrated with him during this stretch of the novel. At best, this was a comment on how a sudden fame can make a young person grow complacent. At worst, it didn't make a lick of sense.<br /><br />And the rival company with nearly infinite resources can't unpack a clue that a freaking Google search would answer? Google must not exist in the future, I guess. And years of research and nitpicking and memorization don't seem to work either.<br /><br />Ernest Cline sets up Halliday as someone obsessed with the 80s, but Watts takes time out to research things that didn't come out until the 90s or 2000s? (My suspicion is that Ernest Cline included these things because his readers like those things, but I have no way of knowing for sure. But the fact that the inclusion of these \\"anachronistic\\" items don't move the story forward was frustrating). Heck, Ernest Cline even used the phrase \\"This might just work\\" in his story. I could go on and on, but I will limit myself to one more point: most upsetting, the book relies on an almost literal deus ex machina and coincidences to repeatedly save Wade Watts from danger.<br /><br />READY PLAYER ONE is a fun read, sure. You'll smile when reading it, particularly if you are of a similar age as me. But, I walked away feeling like this book was like a chocolate Easter Bunny: it looks good on the outside, it's hollow on the inside, and it's largely forgettable once consumed.unpack a clue that a freaking Google search would answer?

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best King book since the completion of The Dark Tower Series, reminiscent of It. A must read for everyone, a great book to start with if you're new to King. Loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|very fun time.if you take a good look and use some spatial geometry skills-(watch which way the coins will move when pushed) the coins last longer. you don't HAVE to purchase coins-just have patience as they give you one every 30 seconds. Let them build up for 10 minutes My disappointment lies with the lack of some prizes. I've been playing a total of about 8 hours now and haven't seen about 6 of the prizes I need to move to the next game.
B001U887WY|4.0|This is my 3rd pair I got for my hubby. I  bought these for him 2 years ago. And 2 again this year, one for the house and one to leave at the cabin. He absolutely loves these, he says there warm & very comfortable. He wears them around the house all day and yes, has even gone to the store with them! Lol. The only downfall is the lining gets dirty & dingy fast and is difficult to take the lining off & on to wash. Overall, I do recommend these!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I have loved &#34;Home&#34; since I first heard it on the radio. Now that I've listened to the whole album, I really like it!!
B008VNIBFO|5.0|Sunset Boulevard [blu-ray] I really enjoyed this movie, and the extras. I would definitely buy this product again. thanks, ania
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I like this product ,backpack it small coast,good.Amazon did good job.Shipping was very fast.Size is very good you can put a lot off things
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've seen the movie, but the book is so much better. I could hardly put it down. It was fast paced and easy to read. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a must have for every age.  One cannot have a well defined movie series without this all time classic.  Great music, acting is superb!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it !!! it could almost be described as mommy porn haha. it is written so well, and very detailed, as i am reading i have a clear image in my mind of what is going on. Best book ever! I highly reccomend!
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Great movie, great cast, the acting is flawless.  You need to own this if you are a serious movie collector.  Paltrow embodies the perfect Emma!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I have seen the movie before and wanted my own copy because I think there is a little of The Dude in all of us.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an amazing novel. Very full of emotion and the characters were real and the situations were so believable. The suspense and the wait was torturous but worth it!
B009X01ELC|5.0|I found this case to be attractive, sturdy and to be just what I wanted for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it!!...definitely my favorite book by Nicholas sparks ....the ending was soon suspenseful and totally didn't see it coming...amazing
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good book, felt the begin was great then got a little bogged down with details, but generally a good read.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The background information that documented this book is excellent. The author's research and interviews are outstanding. The book itself reads like a fictional novel and is very informative.  I couldn't put it down.  I hope Adam Makos decides to find another project and write another book.  This is one of the best on WW II German and American aviation.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I have this on both my kindle fire and android phone. It runs better on the kindle, still crashes on the phone tron time to time. I like it, but wish the radar would load faster. good app.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Same old! minus Jason Bourne. There was nothing new to the story line and neither to the character. Interspersed with references to Bourne to find some legitimacy to fit with the franchise...
B004LWZWGA|5.0|My 34 year old husband, 4 year old son, and 7 year old daughter have all enjoyed watching this a lot!  My son's hero is Batman so I was worried that seeing Bane beat down Batman would bother him, but he really loved it and got that Batman was still the hero.  I myself (age 33) amnot that into action/guy flicks but I did enjoy watching also.  I mean, Christian Bale makes everything nice to watch!
0857685848|3.0|The cover really made me take notice, but its a shame the work inside was not as dynamic as the cover suggested and the lack of how the art work was achieved by the various artists would have made this a great Dinosaur book.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|the CD is very good.  it came to me unharmed and plays very well.  i like the quality of the music cd.
1594481717|3.0|Abundance will elevate the R brain is too simple<br />The point of view is a pretty commercial.<br />It will take more time for the R brainers to take over<br />that point is far from now.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss attacks the skill of learning to cook like a military campaign.  There is so much research, techniques, product information and insights into each skill set that he really engages the reader and makes them want more.  The recipes are simple, the instructions clear, the pictures and illustrations are awesome and it is just fun.  If you are looking to be a cook instead of just learning how to cook then this is for you.
1451627289|4.0|This was a gift for a student who read Bradbury's &#34;A Sound of Thunder&#34; and enjoyed the time travel portion and the idea of messing with the past can affect the present.  She has a voracious appetite for reading and received this last summer (2012) and is enjoying it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Loved it in hardcover and in paper back.  Love it even more in e-book.  The characters are as real today as in the Austen era.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I'm in the process of updating my VHS and DVD library, and when I saw this 50th Anniversary Edition of Lawrence of Arabia, it was a must!  I watched it the night I received it and was dazzled by the Blu-ray edition!  The surprise that was included in the package was an original film from the movie.  I'm very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a an upgraded version of a true classic!
B007NU54H4|5.0|my grand daughter is in love with this dvd she loves tinkerbells sister. that is her favorite person now thanks fast delivery too
B005LAII08|5.0|Great movie! Great package of DVD, Blue Ray, Blue Ray 3D, and digital copy. I won't review the movie, there are plenty of self-appointed movie critics out there already. I love Disney/Pixar and think this a wonderful addition to the library.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I spent time trying to get to the next level and then received a pop-up to pay for the regular pac-man....
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|IT'S SO EASY and fun!If you get it you will love it.but first never get sweet pets.it's a copy of littlest pet shop
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Just as good as season 1. Looking forward to seeing season 3. Great cast, great storyline. Wish I could get it on Netflix.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|this truly was a great, suspenseful novel.  it kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. i cant say the characters seemed completely real to me but it was a great premise and ending.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sad but a wonderful, historical book. Made me think about the past and about the children who suffered. Great book.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|As a huge fan of Mumford and Sons and Dave Matthews I can say, if you like these guys, you'll love Phillip too!  He's amazing and I can't wait to see what he will come out with next!  Not a bad song on this cd.  Also, if you enjoy, check out his AOL sessions youtube videos.  No band, just him and his guitar... wonderful.  He has loads of talent.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very interesting and makes you appreciate our SEALS and the men and women who serve our country.  Their stories often get over looked but there is not fiction that can compare to these real life stories.  Very well written and hard to put down and &#34;must read&#34;
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show has everything! Love, humor, family, brotherhood!!! I have introduced this show to numerous friends, and they all love it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After a few clunkers, Grisham comes out with another good one. A little slow in the middle but I recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|My daughters love this series. We have everyone. They read them over and over. All four from my 8 year-old to my 5 year-old and my 7 year-old twins in the middle.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|It had some very good moments and also some very corny moments with some horrible acting.  The song selection was great and most of the actors sang them very well.
B000O75VSK|5.0|I was sad to see After Forever split up after the release of this album.  The good thing is, they went out with something good.  Many bands will spend years together and start off with several good albums and then lose it (coughmetallicacough, however, i cannot say After Forever have any bad albums.<br /><br />By this time they have almost completely moved away from their Gothic roots and established a more \\"in-your-face\\" somewhat power metal album while continuing with the beauty and the beast vocal arrangements.  Floor is once again amazing on this album.<br /><br />The album has a good variety on it from the more pop oriented \\"Energize me,\\" to the catchy ballad \\"Cry with A Smile\\" to the more thrashy \\"Transitory.\\"  And then powerful themed lyrics such as can be found in \\"Equally Destructive.\\"<br /><br />Once again AF deliver an album that is about well written songs, not showy impossibly to play guitar solos.  The musicians are talented but it is definitely the song writing that makes this album strong.  If you liked After Forever's last album \\"Remagine\\" you probably will like this one even more as this is almost an improved version of \\"Remagine.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it but wish could get coins faster. my hubby and I play this all the time together at night to relax.
B0099ETLPS|4.0|I must confess that I normally do not buy into the current 'Deluxe Edition' trend being put forth by the record companies, however, I made an exception with 'LLR&R' , simply because my only copy of this recording is on vinyl, and the bonus material piqued my interest. Plunking down the extra bucks for the DE of this album has proven to be a worthwhile expense, and one that I would strongly recommend. Great remastering and sound quality, and the bonus stuff does not disappoint.  Long Live RJD !!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game!!!!  Great graphics, keeps you busy for awhile. Only down side is seems like the game takes a short time to finish!!!!  Well worth it tho
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this game to play with my husband, not generally a game player, and he and I have both enjoyed it tremendously. We have been playing with two colors each and have found it surprisingly challenging!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish. A very interesting concept and a a very surprising ending.  I just wish I knew if she remembered the next day.  Again, a good read.<br /><br />B. Stevenson

B00846REIS|5.0|Definitely a must read book! Similar to 50 shades of Gray....couldn't put the book down!!! Hoping there's more to this novel ;)
B007B6VOG0|5.0|my child introduced me to Fun. I love the band...love the lead singer's voice....absolutely love the song &#34;some nights&#34;.  Very, very happy.
B00321GTJU|5.0|Planet Earth was amazing when it originally aired in 2006 and has not lost any of its luster since. I really enjoyed watching this series again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Good quality dvd, shipped quickly.  Bought this movie over the holidays to complete our Harry Potter set.  A wonderful series of movies for the young and old.  I love being able to watch the characters grow up into young adults, it adds just the right touch of 'awe'.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Excellent price and definitely helped make my iPOD touch experience even better because I've been able to connect it to any television and the handy included charger just makes everything painless!
B001F12J0C|5.0|A brilliant series of movies!  This has been on my husbands wish list for some time, and I was over the moon happy to find the trilogy on Amazon for such a great deal!  Happy hubby, and I love watching the Borne Trilogy as much as he does!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie! The story was similar to original but enough change to make it fun and entertaining!
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I went to see the movie and of course came home and bought the soundtrack, only to realize that several amazing songs were completely left out, such as lovely ladies, do you hear the people sing and little people (which was far to short in the movie to begin with.)<br />I hope beyond belief that another version will become available that includes all the songs. I don't really care that it'll be as long as the movie...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastically suspenseful, twisted read!  Couldn't put it down!<br />I am looking forward to diving into another Flynn novel as soon as possible.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a really great deal. It is definitely better than purchasing both seasons separately. I cannot wait until season three is available in the United States!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|i highly enjoyed life of pi, it's not without it's flaws though.  took FOREVER to get to the good part, almost to the point of me giving up on the book.  also theologically speaking this book isn't good at all.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Very cute love story. It is clean and the music is also very nice. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good chick-flick.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really enjoying the story line.  great graphics. puzzles not too hard. would recommend to anyone. really fun. id like to play a sequel
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Not particularly a big sci-fi fan, however the character acting by JGL was very good. He got all of BWʻs expressions  and mannerisms down. JGL has a lot going for him as a character actor. BW has definitely done better in other action roles as a cocky hard talking old timer action star. The plot definitely plays to the title &#34;Looper&#34;, but the overstatement of other details in the movie is distracting and doesnʻt tie in well together.
B005C4ERHQ|4.0|I got this book for my daughter after it was recommended by a friend that said he uses this book where he works as part of their employee training. She was feeling directionless in what to do with her life and where to focus or what to do. This book did help her find her strengths and now she is focusing and developing those aspects. I want the book for myself.<br />I wish it came with more codes to use online. Seems silly for only one person to use the book. That is my only complaint.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I used this immediately after buying it. I needed a reminder to place a phone call. I had  choices in alarm sounds that were interesting. It does a good job for me<br />.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Lots of non-stop action...and the good guys win!  Seeing all of the old action heros together in one film is a Kick!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Fantastic, full of twists and turns and you never know what is going to happen. I hope there is more to follow
B009CGYO0K|5.0|This was a very comical book. If you own a cat, you should definitely read this!  Some of the things seemed very true with my cat. Haha.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was interesting and kept my attention so much that I have bought and read the next book and now I can't wait until May so that I can continue. It is not as HOT as 50 shades but it is a good read........HAPPY READING
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This CD has a very nice new sound to it, Phillip has a great gift, he wrote alot of the songs on this, which is so wonderful for being so young.  Something on it for everyone.  My children and grandchildren have this in their cars, and I'm 73 years old and play mine in the house. Talk about an age difference. 22 year old male, 42 year old female office manger, and Grandma.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Having read her other novels, I had expectations of fast paced action but this book is different.<br /><br />I grew tired of trying to remember the various characters (many) and kept wondering how they fit together.  I wondered how the plot would end as the characters meandered from place to place.<br /><br />This book would be great for someone who has a lot of time to figure out the relationships.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My wife really wanted to see this...and I am glad I watched it with her! Very funny and more than I expected!<br /><br />Watch it!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought that this would be a light book but found that there were topics that shock although teens might experience or discuss these things in their lives.  There is a sense of sad hopefulness that makes me ask why?
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|Several years ago, a missionary friend of mine asked me \\"Why is it that some countries become prosperous, and others fail miserably?\\"  Because of that question, this book intrigued me.<br /><br />Content wise, the book gives a brief tour of the usual economic theories of success and failure and then points out historical examples and counter examples to demonstrate how the theory performs in application.  It then takes up the author's point that distribution of power but with limits (neither overly centeralized nor completely in the hands of individuals) is necessary but not sufficient.  Institutions that make resources available (instead of restricting them to a powerful class of crony's) are also required.<br /><br />The author also notes that power systems are \\"sitcky\\" and they tend to persist even through revolution--witness the goings on in the Middle East.  This book was written contemporary with the \\"Arab Spring\\"...<br /><br />One of the difficulties of this theory is that migration of power and wealth from the few to the many, without becoming overly diffuse, is generally viewed as a positive. The problem is that no quantitative (or even qualitative) methodology is proposed for prejudging which power struggles will result in benefit and which will be detrimental.<br /><br />For example, is the current power struggle in the US Congress (seen as between the advantaged and the disadvantaged) an economically beneficial or detrimental struggle?  I didn't feel that the book provided forward looking guidelines in this case.<br /><br />One of the validity tests for theories is their ability to predict the outcomes of future experiments.  I would have appreciated some predictions based on current events at the time of the writing for validation.<br /><br />I wish the theory were more clearly stated and that the parameters involved were more clearly defined.  Providing some sort of quantifiable metric would also be useful, if it were possible.  I enjoyed reading so much history from around the world, and I was surprised to find out that Mexico is not a democracy (or republic) as we think of it in the States.<br /><br />Well worth the read!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Good program and I really like the way it shows different categories for you to chose from.  I first tried MAPS and chose a city.  Boom it was there and I could then get closer of get a view from space.  The view from space is great if you from outer space and needed directions. I wish they had a street view but what do you want for free.  I highly recommend this program.  Remember if your reading this as a space person \\"My Casa is Not Your Casa\\" Go Away.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is the best show on TV... EVER! I would recomend to anyone who likes anything! Love Deryl Dixon ALOT
B004DM0UII|5.0|This program is outstanding.  I like music and got this so I can hear Music as I use my tablet.  I just typed Japan in the search feature (No reason I could have type Ethiopia but I was not sure of the spelling!) and a list of Japanese listening language) channels appeared.  I selected one and BAM (Like the Chef!) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga.  I wonder what they were saying during the commercials?  I highly recommend this program.
0345803485|4.0|This book was not the best, if you want smut, good old fashion porn works way better than this book. Story line is horrible
B008M87GJK|5.0|I really liked this link to BBC.  It is just like what you will see on the TV version but you can view it anytime.  I really like BBC as I get a better feeling or view of how people in another country feel about a subject.  I recommend this program.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Love these books!  I have read them several times and they just get better and better.  I can't wait for the movie to come out in August!
0345803507|2.0|The books went down hill after the first one, I would not recomend waisting your time on this book or the second one, it's the same thing over and over.
0441013597|5.0|So yeah, this is one of THOSE books on my list: Amazing, Classic.<br /><br />The first time through I had to force myself through the first few pages. I don't know why, I just couldn't really get into it.  Now of course when I reread it, I'm just immediately sucked into the world again.  Definitely worth it. Loved the setting and the story. Pretty much everything was perfect.<br /><br />For the later books, I wish prescience hadn't become such a major plot point but in this book, it adds just the right \\"spice\\" to a great story. :)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I chose this rating because I really did LOVE this movie. I wasn't sure if I was going to but after watching the first time I had to keep watching it! so funny! and the music was great!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This story has been put on screen so many times, but putting it in present time gives It a great new twist. Exciting and smart.

0761158820|5.0|I bought this book for my children, ages 6 and 9, and it has been a huge hit for the whole family.  The monsters are very creative and my son in particular loves to read their descriptions and personalities.  He remembers all of their names and keeps inventory.  I have found that the monsters are pretty easy to punch out and fold, as they are pre perforated and also scored for folding.  Some of the more intricate designs are hard for my kiddos to punch out, let alone build, so when they are building themselves they stick to the ones marked &#34;easy&#34;.  We have been using a school glue stick to put them together and it doesn't work very well, but that's our own fault for being too lazy to hunt down a better glue bottle in our house.<br /><br />Every kid that has seen our monsters has been fascinated and I am back to order a couple more to have on hand as birthday gifts.  Highly recommended, especially if your kid is mechanical and into Lego construction, etc.
B00846REIS|3.0|first of all wtf another book about dominant and Subs boring! Fifty shades of grey is so much better and they should totally sue the author for being a copycat. Don't buy waste of money boring and messed up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read. Good insight into the twisted perspective of a wife beater. Chilling and charming all at the same time, this book is perfectly paced  with a well thought out plot.
B002VHI8J0|2.0|with its construction into 5 different story it's quite hard to enter into the book. The first 2 stories dont seem to go anywhere. there is a bit of action from the 3 story<br />Not for someone who likes book with a lot of action
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It will not let me upload pictures that I have in my kindle and I have the same problems I read from other reviews about the news feed not want is to load.Also non of the other applications that I have in which you can connect through Facebook will actually do it .

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Heart warming story that includes many characters many mini adventures made by a young girl and her amazing friends the lion scarecrow and the tin woodman
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great follow up to one shot<br /><br />Excellent read and great story shortcut a great twist that was not expected expected at all
B003Y6GJD4|5.0|This is a first rate thriller which closely follows the excellent book on which it is based.  The performances are top notch.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I really enjoy shinedown. They always have good tracks. Like all their songs. Great album!! I recomend this to anyone.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a classic book that has withstood the decades of time. I saw bits of the story enacted on PBS, but I couldn't always understand the why for different characters in the book.  Now I will be able to understand in depth the whys and wherefores.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Adam Lambert's sophomore album Trespassing blows his first one completely out of the water! Although For your Entertainment was a great album, Trespassing is a thrill ride! It also gives you a more in-depth look at the artist himself through his music. His vocal ability is simply amazing. Adam even adds some of his own writing to the project with Outlaws of Love. It is rare that I like every song on an album but i have to admit I love every song on this CD! I can not wait to see what Adam comes up with next!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are lots of different games that remind me of when I was a kid. Great for when I've got a few minutes to kill &amp; want to do something fun &amp; not too challenging.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Much better than other albums. You will be suprised. The acoustic and blues section stand out.I would buy this first!
B006L9B6TI|3.0|Ms. Byrne took the virtue of gratitude and created a book that was a bit of a stretch in many areas.  I had a hard time believing that if I was just thankful for the money I had, I would receive more.  If I was thankful for my health, my scars would clear up.  I did like the idea of writing 10 things I was thankful for each day.  I still like to do this.  I also name three things I enjoyed about my day and pick the one I like the best.<br /><br />I found that many of the concepts were reworded over and over.  Maybe the book needed to be a certain length.  I would probably not recommend this book, since I did not find it too magical.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Nice set, nice collection of progression of Mr. Mayer, and his extraordinary talent with a guitar.Acoustic sessions give his songs a nice simple flavor also.
0156027321|1.0|I am going to be calling a spade an agricultural traditional hand tool.<br /><br />Reading those five-star-awarding reviews on this website, while deeply moved by the generosity extended by those reviewers, I constantly ask myself, are these people for real? Or even more seriously, are they honest?<br /><br />Or, perhaps it is I where the problems lie. I must have missed something terribly great during my teenager years, namely, reconciling the three great religions of the world, with which Pi was preoccupied with a raging passion. I still remember those shameful and disgusting deeds I committed when I was a teenager, being under the spell of the raging hormone, being subjected to the tyranny of ever surging testosterone. I thought that was natural until I read the Life of Pi.<br /><br />Come on, who are we kidding! Who in their right mind would buy that story? Apparently, a lot of them, and their mind seems not quite right to me. But, hey, who am I to say what is right and what is wrong?<br /><br />This is a twisted tale that reflects the state of mind of the West, which is also appeared to be twisted. The author is trying to find something that would revitalise an ailing and aging, literally and figuratively, civilisation, to wake up a hedonistic and godless generation, to confront life-threatening conditions with true self confidence. The reality is, as the author rightly realised, that no amount of material wealth, technological advance, and military power is going to satisfy man's longing for spiritual peace and security. The ever innovative ways of consuming natural resources offered by the West are not going quench the thirst for true inspiration.<br /><br />The author's solution is to produce a GM religion by mixing polytheism and monotheism in one test tube, and then forge a clinical trial report to pass the substance off as an elixir to treat the ailment of the West. To me, it sounds like a plumber has looped the sewage pipe and the tap water pipe of a household, expecting to create some kind of holistic, organic, inclusive, ecologically sound, sustainable system.<br /><br />The fact that the book sells well says much about the West, a really confused lot.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Awesome! Live is better, you will enjoy this whether you are a new fan or not. Suprises with the 3 sets give a new respect of that &#34;singingl&#34; guitar in the blues section. I wish he had another. I cant wait to buy his newer work, he has really set himself apart from a young POP musician. His vitality in every note gives you all of his energy.I would buy this becasuse it is a collective of his work.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A very good read and a good opportunity to reflect upon the true meaning of the Christmas season. Recommended for readers of all ages.

B009HELT3C|5.0|Found this to be very entertaining, and revealing for their good relationship. We get an insight how events of the past have a significant impact on their friendship. Very motivational.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|First, I should say that I primarily read historical fiction.  I don't often read contemporary stories, however I have enjoyed Nicholas Sparks work in the past.<br /><br />Alex and Katie were good, if not a tad bit boring, characters.  I liked them both, even if Alex was a little TOO perfect, and rooted for them.  Kevin was a bad guy.  I disagree with other reviewers who found him stereotypical and repetitive.  As a mental health professional, I read his portions with a sense of mania that rang true for me.  One reviewer disliked the repetitive \\"He was a good detective\\" line.  For me, it spoke with Kevin's desperation and lack of a grip on reality... he clung to his belief that he was a good detective, despite evidence to the contrary and an obvious descent into madness.<br /><br />I enjoyed Katie's learning to trust and enjoy simple pleasures again.  The end was suspenseful to me (if not a bit long), and I could picture the scenes in my mind's eye.  Overall, I liked the story. I did think \\"love\\" happened too quickly, and parts of the story were too wordy for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There's nothing like being able to take your bible with you wherever you go. At times I run out the house and forget my bible for church but this comes in handy.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|My kid loves these movies, blu ray Jurassic Park is even better. He likes it when the dinos eat people and stuff. haha
B004LROUW2|4.0|great story that keeps you hooked. Strong character development throughout the novel...but maybe a little unrealistic characters..their interior monologues tilted towards dramatic.
B000YT3KEA|4.0|Over all I'm very pleased with this book. Hence the 4 stars. I'm a huge fan of CS Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia series. So I wanted a picture book to introduce my children to the story.<br /><br />Yet, I suppose like any translation of something dear to your heart it never fully lives up to your expectations. This picture book is short and glosses over much of the story, but what was I expecting? If you want the entire story by the novel.<br /><br />The art is good and the translation of the text is good. Not amazing. But good.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|The most interesting part was seeing how this boy viewed and interacted with his world. I'm curious to know what the author's experience with autism was.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would give it 5 stars just because it is solitaire, however after every game, a new ad pops up and the method to remove the ad before being allowed to play the game is different apparently based on the advertiser....Just another good reminder when something says it is FREE, it isn't.  There is always someone, somewhere paying for FREE.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well thought out and well executed.<br />The hero is like a combination between Spock and Tosh.o. Very funny and very entertaining

1609611543|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Great read for anyone that is trying to get to the bottom of their health issue or for someone that just wants to find out what they are putting in their body
1589795474|1.0|This book, breathlessly promoted as \\"The Real Story\\" of what<br />millionaires are \\"really like\\" is based on what looks to be a very<br />poorly designed survey.  In the appendix, the authors explain the<br />basis for their conclusions.<br /><br />It turns out is a survey sent to neighborhoods thought to hold<br />high wealth people.  3,000 surveys were sent out of which<br />barely more than 1/3 were returned, of which 385 turned out<br />to be millionaires.  Off hand, I would say that no reliable<br />conclusions could be drawn from this.  It doesn't seem like<br />a true random sample, and has too small a sample size.<br /><br />As this is outside my area of expertise, I would be interested in<br />hearing from a professional statistician.  Otherwise, I am assuming<br />the book is merely a collection of anecdotes.<br /><br />I would imagine any study of wealthy people would be devilishly<br />difficult.  For one thing, standard surveys have a margin of error<br />around 2-3%.  Some estimates put the millionaires in the US at<br />around 5% of the population, so just the margin of error would<br />swamp any attempt to capture the truth about millionaires.<br /><br />At the very least, there was very annoying statics given.  For<br />instance, a certain kind of car was owned by \\"5.9%\\" of millionaires.<br />Even if you have a gold standard survey, statistically there is NO WAY<br />you can have less than a 1/10 % margin of error to make a number<br />such as 5.9% meaningful.<br /><br />The authors talk about focus groups in which the rich drink cheap<br />beer, and \\"regular guy\\" food.  But how do they know they are<br />really rich people - they just have to accept people's word on<br />what is in their bank account.  My personal hunch is that a bunch<br />of working class Joes saw the authors as easy marks to scam<br />free food & drink from, and have a laugh at them.<br /><br />Even if it turns out that my strong suspicions that this book is<br />shoddily researched is a false assumption, I would still dislike<br />the book.  There was a huge amount of \\"what millionaires are<br />like\\" and \\"how they got that way\\".  There was nothing on \\"Why?\\".<br /><br />The millionaires profiled here are very materialistic.  Not in the<br />normal meaning of wanting to spend on exotic cars, glitzy jewelery,<br />etc.; but in the sense they are only concerned with how much wealth<br />they control.<br /><br />To a certain extent that is understandable.  The people in the book<br />run profitable small businesses, and to do that you have to have<br />a passionate love of what you do, and a single minded focus on it.<br /><br />This would partly explain their low spending.  For example, if one:<br /><br />- could sell their business for $800,000<br />- have $180,000 in home equity<br />- have clothes, cars, furniture, and other material goods worth $30,000<br />- had bank and other financial accounts of $40,000, and no debts<br /><br />One would be a millionaire with wealth of $1.05 million.  This<br />wouldn't support a spending spree.  That is, unless they sold<br />the business which they enjoy running, or perhaps their house,<br />but you have to live somewhere.<br /><br />However, in a world with enormous problems, you would like to know<br />what the millionaires think their responsibility to the world is.<br />Beyond one joking that \\"my favorite charity is myself\\" there<br />was very little.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this Melody Gardot CD. Easy to listen to. Has an old night club jazz feel. Will definitely purchase more of her music.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is by far the best 3D I've seen in Blue-Ray. The effect was extremely good on my LG 55LM8600. Except for screen size it was every bit as exciting as in the theater release.  When Avatar first came out I was convinced that it broke new ground in the proper use of 3D to enhance a movie and this DVD confirms that opinion.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|I can't get my mother to play many games, but she couldn't get enough of this one. The fast and simple gameplay coupled with elements of risk, chance, and competition were perfect for her. She doesn't have the patience for longer or more complicated games, but she was happy to play round after round of this.<br /><br />I've introduced many people to Zombie Dice since I purchased it, and I've yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy it. It's fun to sit around the table and trash talk each other when someone gets an incredibly lucky set of rolls, and then applaud when they risk it all and walk away with nothing. And there's just something about the game that encourages you to play big or go home (it's much more impressive to get 9 brains in a round and lose, than to win by get 2 brains every round.)<br /><br />I guess my only suggestion is to hold the bottom of the cup while shaking the dice, since if you shake hard enough the bottom can fall out and dice will fly everywhere. Ask me how I know...

B0059XTUB8|5.0|Michelle Williams turned in an Oscar-winning performance in My Week with Marilyn. I disagree with those reviewers who said Ms. Williams missed the mark portraying Marilyn due to a lack of charisma, bombshell sex appeal, etc. The film was meant to (and did) portray Marilyn as Colin Clark remembered her during the filming of The Prince and the Showgirl. Read his book and you'll find the film very closely follows it. Both the book and the film describe a woman who was tormented by her own fame and status as a bombshell, which she believed kept her from being taken seriously as an actress, a wife, and a person. Michelle Williams brings Marilyn's insecurity and sadness to this film in a way that is heartbreakingly real. Whether you're a fan of Williams or not, this is definitely, in my opinion, her best performance ever.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Ive been reading lots of books over the Navy Seals and this is one of the best. This guy is an animal.<br />Great book!!!

B0093X80VQ|5.0|My four year old couldn't go to bed without reading a few chapters and asked for it first thing in the morning as well. Love the kindle edition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is one of the best Nicholas Sparks books I've ever read. It takes you deep into the mind of an abuser and the abusee. I would highly recommend to anyone!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The story was great with a sad undertone. The only thing that bothered me was some of the terms of writing were misleading. The characters were from the United States but the characters dialogue sounded as though they were British.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Affordable for the quality. It was a gift for my husband and he loved it. Great sound and great music. A must have for a Tommy fan!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is great. My girlfriend and I play it all the time and take turns earning gold for a weapons and armor. The only problem we had was earning gems is a pain.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son, nephew and myself love this game. We have not stopped playing it since we got it. Awesome game.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought Journey Collector's Edition for myself, but both me and my teenage son are loving this game.  I have played all 3 games, and they're amazing.  The music is beautiful, the graphics are spectacular, and the ease of play is wonderful.  Overall a very relaxing group of games.  A warning that all games are playable in under 3 hours, but they are so great that you are going to want to do it again and again.
146500632X|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my 14 year old niece who likesOne Direction and she loved it. Makes an easy gift for a pre-teen or teenage girl.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This was a good movie.  Definately worth seeing.  I would recommend to an adult audience as it's a spin on the snow white fairy tale.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Some parts of book i did not like,thought they had to many sex chapter loved the falling in love part
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was so well written and on such an unusual topic. I was as intrigued with the story as I was by the circus. I had to really think about the story in order to pull it together.  I imagined a movie based on this book as I was reading. It would take a talented amount of special effects to give this book justice. The author managed to mystify the reader just like anyone who entered the circus was mystified. I would definitely read this author's next book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny I think you totally improved from your last book I've read all your books and I think this know is the funniest.
034580404X|4.0|There is a lot of sex in it but there is a story also which makes it all good.  Very well done.
0307719774|5.0|This journal is awesome. It's on the small side which is nice, I love the way it looks on the inside and outside, and the questions are exciting to answer. I'm already looking forward to filling out an entry each day and I just got it in the mail an hour ago. I'd recommend this to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie's view on the world is raw and refreshing. I was expecting a book about a shy kid living vicariously through his peers and instead I got to know Charlie on a more personal level than I ever could have imagined. He's a very emotional boy who is a lot stronger than he realizes. I enjoyed this book immensely and would strongly recommend it to everyone.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It wasn't as funny as the other ones. I think it could have more of a better story behind it..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books in a week. I was completely captivated by the story and their true love. A true page turner. A must read again and again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very upsetting and graphic. Great details. Loved all the perspectives that we're described, even the ex husband's. I recommend this book!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I didn't expect to like this game as much as I have. Its been great entertainment and just enough of a challenge to be fun rather than frustrating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a good game..it is fun, just like the real minecraft. It has good, responsive controls, and the bulls dont chase you down and kill you like on survival craft, a free version.
0439023491|5.0|This was my favorite book out of the series.  The story is definitely more engaging but it leaves off at a major cliff hanger at the end which leads into the 3rd book.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I thought this was a great game until it crashed and basically froze my kindle. I removed the game immediately after my kindle finally started working again.
0439023513|4.0|The ending of the series was somewhat of a let down.  Overall I still enjoyed the book and I loved the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did an excellent job with this book. I'm a little late in reading it, but I'm already a big fan!
B0069JBKHI|3.0|I finally have this camera up and running and so far I'm happy with how it is functioning, but it has taken me over a week to get the camera set up.  The only way I found to contact the company was to e-mail.  I never heard back from the company for product support and ended up fiddling with the camera for ages and searching the net for answers before getting it working.  The batter it comes with does not hold a charge and I'm in the process of figuring out how to contact the company for a replacement.  On the other hand I'm really excited that I can view the camera picture from anywhere :)
B00ADYYBFI|2.0|I just don't love it.  I thought it would be good considering the show is AWESOME.  It's ok but not great.
B008ILPJTK|4.0|Sounds like Dream Theater, but that isn't a bad thing. The newer releases by Circus Maximus are moving away somewhat from this clone like sound. (again not a bad thing) Hope they keep on evolving and am looking forward to their next release.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|As a big fan of the Bourne series, I had high expectations and was looking forward to The Bourne Legacy!  The movie had great action scenes, but the story line and overall move fell way short to what I was expecting.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Indiana Jones has to be one of the best. He is to the eighties, what Tarzan and the Lone Ranger was to the fifties and James Bond was to the sixties and seventies - and now Bond has returned ... he's still cool, andIndiana Jones is awesome.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have just started the book and am very happy with the way it is written.  You get a feel for the characters personality. It is one of the best book I have read recently and look forward to continuing my reading
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I've been using the free version for a while and the streaming quality was quite low 33kbps ACC quality which sounds somewhat like mono.  I figured the &#34;Pro&#34; version would give you the option of streaming at higher bit rates but unfortunately that is not the case.  Since this was a &#34;free&#34; app, I'm not to terribly concerned.  I still get good quality streaming from pandora.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|My wife and I were really disappointed with Brave.  We have loved all of the Pixar movies (except the Cars series).  What we love the most about Pixar is how intelligent, heartfelt, and truly funny their movies are.  They never stoop down to potty humor for easy laughs.  Well, Brave is not the Pixar we know and love.  It is Disney's Pixar:  more generic, more lowbrow, more mass-market.  I was actually a little bored watching it.  There's potty humor and naked butts, too.  Definitely not the Pixar that created the masterpieces Up, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo.  I hope their next movie is a winner.  I would say that Brave, Cars, and Cars II are all sub-Pixar standards.
B000ID37LS|4.0|Was well acted, Michael J. Fox is a funny guy and the show was something the whole family could watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and fell in love with the characters.  Colleen Hoover has a magical ability to create characters that you can relate to and fall in love with and root for against impossible odds.  You smile as you read the story, laugh, cry, and hold your breath.  She surprises with some great plot twists, and at the end you are left wanting more.  The characters are so well developed you can feel right along with them as you read, and they have reactions that you feel you would have.  She uses humor and catch phrases that stick with you and give the story even further depth.  I have read Hopeless twice now and I am sure I will go back to it again in the future.  I have loved all three of her books and I can't wait to read whatever she decides to create next.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|great actors, great script, these two really worked well together and I felt the movie was fun and great for the whole family.
178054068X|5.0|I ordered this calendar for my granddaughter, who is a fan of the boy band One Direction, as a part of her Christmas gift.  To my disappointment, the expected arrival date was given as mid-January, but I let the order stand.  To my surprise, the calendar arrived a few days before Christmas, and I was able to give it as planned.  Thanks for going above and beyond expectations to help make a teen's Christmas special.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|I have never been a fan of Roger Waters Solo ablums for several years. I love Pink Floyd and wished they had not split and continued to make records. While Roger always wrote the lyrics and played Bass Guitar, I always thought David Gilmour to be the soul behind Pink Floyd, including his vocals, until I heard this album Amused to Death. It changed my very perception of Roger Waters, and now I understand he was the heart and soul of everything Pink Floyd. If only they had united again and released this album as Pink Floyd, it would have topped several charts, to me it is the best album done by Roger, as good as the Dark side of the moon, The Wall or Animals.<br /><br />I got this CD a few years ago, like many reviewers, never gave it a good listen, I was also much younger and the songs never caught on to me listening to Roger's dark theme in this album. Recently I gave the CD another go, and now I am hooked and a permanent disc in my CD player. I have heard the songs again and again and again, they sound so fresh and awesome with every listen. A brilliant concept album where each song blends in to the other like many Pink Floyd albums.<br /><br />The first title song sets the stage for the entire album. The songs Perfect Sense, What God wants, Three Wishes, Miracle and the title track are all classics. I always thought how cool it would have been if Gilmour had played the lead guitar on this album, but Jeff Beck is brilliant. His style of play along with Rogers vocals blend so perfectly. The solo guitars on the tracks What God wants, Three wishes and the title track Amused to Death are so powerful and haunting.<br /><br />It is almost 20 years since this album was released, the lyrics so fresh that it is more valid now than ever before. I find it hard to believe that Roger could come up with so powerful lyrics which makes us wonder what our future would be as we continue fighting wars even now, and hooked on to modern day social websites, media and television with nofeelings left. The quality of recording is spot on, and if you hear this album thro' headphones the Q-Sound mix is magical. To quote Roger Waters, \\"God wants Insurance to cover his soul, What God wants, God gets, God Help us all\\".<br /><br />If you have not bought this album, it is highly recommended and one of the finest concept albums ever recorded. An absolute masterpiece.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fab grafics and loads of fun I loved this game<br />I would recommend this game to all kindle users holds you captive until I wax done
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I love this game I have all of them on my phone my kindle its the best. Can't wait for more updates.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I had a hard time putting the book down. It has plenty of twists and turns. The characters are so endearing I did not have difficulty remembering details from the first book.  It takes you on an unexpected journey that is both informative and thrilling.  Can't wait for the next book.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Love the story. Great music. Great cast too. Watch it. Feel-good for sure. Definitely a hit for us on movie night.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I didn't realize I could only take pictures of myself w/ this app.  This app does not do anything for me.  It was a waste of money.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Kevin can play all my favorites.  I loved him as Wyatt Earp and he does a good job as Robin Hood.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|basic calculator. does as described.  I use this at least once a month for my budget and I works great every time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a beautiful yet sad story, at first I thought it was just a  teenage romance story, yet it turned into such a much deeper story, my congratulations to the author.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I really like the plot of this movie. The characters and development are splendid. It does take one or two times watching to catch all the little details, but it's such a visually rich film that's watching more than once isn't any sort of burden.
B007EECSFA|2.0|took too long to get to the gist of the story. Hints given throughout but difficult to follow in the way it was written
1476719071|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book a lot-nope I'm not a teenager anymore,etc. that's not why i liked it so much as many reviews mentioned. The book made me laugh and I liked the story a lot. It was easy to read and,enjoyable and entertaining. A cute love story. I noticed many readers didn't agree with Travis behavior etc. and wrote harsh critics about how negatively it can influence teenage girls view of a relationship-but come one guys, it's a book and nothing is real about it.Plus then my advise, never read 50Shades or the Crossfire triolgy if you are against some violent man character.<br /><br />I read this book and enjoyed it without spending too much thought about it how it could influence other people;simple because I WANNA ENJOY what I read and don't do it for other ppl.<br /><br />In short: I really loved this book! It's a fast-reading book that offers a romantic love story about two stubborn/troubled teenagers that go through a lot. It has a lot of funny parts that made me laugh while reading. Overall I enjoyed it A LOT!<br /><br />I'm aware some have the opposite opinion and that's ok-everyone is entitled to their own opinion ;-)<br /><br />I'm looking forward to read the second book!!!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Bought this as a recommendation from my sister.  I LOVE this trilogy!  I listen to it over and over while driving, cleaning...
1936891026|5.0|Yes, this is a book for everyone to read whether you write or not, draw or not or simply dream. We unfortunately seem to live in a negative, manipulated world and allow our brains to be sucked out along with our lives and dreams. Steven hits the nail right on the head on how to combat this. I know as a writer, this book has saved me much anguish. Read it. You will not be sorry.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't wait for Season 2.  This is one series where watching them all at once is fun - like a good book, you can't put it down.  Definitely would recommend.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book has the info to get anyone started toward the abundant minimalist  lifestyle.  A must read for those seeking simplicity.
0525952926|5.0|Great book, very informative, I learned more about the WW2 than I ever learned in school.  Great characters, although their names were confussing, the cheat sheet in front of the book was helpful.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Great movie.  One of the best of the four.  Lots of good humor.  Family loved it.  Great price.  Better than in the stores.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|Better writing, better storyline, better characters -- I can hardly wait for each episode.  Well done!!  Waiting patiently for MORE.
0962477060|5.0|The author of this book is amazing, after purchasing this book and going to through the lessons for about a week or so my barre chords have progressed immensly. He conveys the information in a common sense approach which is easy to understand and apply. I would suggest this book to any level of player if they want to enhance their music theory and usage of what is taught in the book. It cleared a lot of confusion up for me because on youtube music training videos already assume that you know the basics etc. They also sometimes provide the wrong information, they are only giving you what works for them everyone is different.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a story with fascinating twists and turns. Well and originally written. Calls for a sequel! It is more than a who done it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|As movies are actually up to the individual, according to each ones taste, you must choice for yourself. Yet my granddaughter did like it.
6300182282|5.0|I wanted it because I had remembered enjoying it years ago. I would recommend it to others who are older.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book was a kindle edition. I guess it is okay if that is what you like. It appears to be of fine quality. It appears that my granddaughter did not like it herself that much. She only read a few pages. It is not my type of reading. That is why I gave a no opinion.
0060763280|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone! Not only does it teach you about ways to improve your life financially, it teaches you how to improve your life in all areas
B006O6F932|4.0|The Monster High high school is a larger play area than I expected it to be. My 9 year old loves it. She takes it out nearly daily since getting it for Christmas, and stores it away t night before bedtime. I gave it four out of five stars because of all of the small pieces that are easily lost that come along with the set. If your child enjoys Monster High, they'll love this set!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Splendid. Thought provoking and reflective. An emotional roller coaster that had me crying and laughing at regular intervals. Much enjoyed.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I have not used this much so far but what I have done on it has been really good. As I find out more about everything I am sure I will enjoy it even more.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|If you are looking for something that is unchallenging but will keep you entertained then read this book. Fast paced and fun this wouldn't win an Oscar if it was a movie but would do well at the box office.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've read all of his books and find this one to be one of his best yet.  I could not put it down!  SandyV
030759565X|5.0|Every cook will get caught in a rut now and again. This book is the antidote. The pictures are lovely, the directions are clear, and the food is exciting. A very good choice for the novice or the seasoned cook!<br /><br />KrysP
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app its the best there's like100 levels its awesome there's not a thing wrong with it really
0525952926|5.0|This book wasn't for me, but a gift.  I think it was a perfect gift for the person that received it.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is the best book ever & the best movie ever!  The characters are pudgy & cute with nice voices.  They made the movie right along with the book with a few extras for detailing.  This is an excellent movie & is only about 25min or so which is perfect for an evening of Dinner & a Movie with my 5yr old!!
0439023521|5.0|arrived in great shape working great would recommend to anyone better then I was expecting it to be might order more later on
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does the job just fine. I use it all the time as a nurse and love it!  No unnecessary stuff. Does what it says. Perfect =)
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I bought this CD thinking it was used and it wasn't.  It was brand new!  It arrived very quickly and I was very pleased with the product.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The only reason I gaved it one star was because there is no other option for a lower rating.  Sorry but it's true, this movie is the worst!
B000093FLA|5.0|I love this movie. It's packed with lots of action, and has a plot/story line that just doesn't quit! Even at the end of the movie, the twists just kept coming! Very entertaining, and is definitely one of my favorite rolls for Brad Pitt!
1423140591|5.0|My daughter bought this book, so I picked it up to see what all the fuss was about. 30 pages later I realized I'd better get back to work!
B00007ELEL|5.0|My husband and I absolutely LOVE this movie! It has definitely become a classic since its release a few years back! And rightfully so! It was brilliantly done, and the cast was awesome! You couldn't have picked better actors who were more suitable for each role!
1423136802|5.0|All the Percy Jackson books are a fun to read, so buying the set just makes sense! A must buy!
B001H5X7JS|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this movie, lots of good actors involved.  It is an over-all funny movie! Gave us lots of laughs!
1423140605|5.0|My daughter wanted the complete set, so when it came up for sale she grabbed it at a great price!
B0089IGUP4|5.0|I just recently got into these guys from hearing them on satellite radio. I bought their album because of a couple of songs that I heard. I was pleasantly suprised at how good the whole cd is. I can put it on and listen to it all the way through without skipping any tracks. That to me, is hard to find in today's music. I would definitely buy their next album and may look into their stuff before this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game to play.  When I run out of coins I simply play something else until regenerated with new.  Only down side is I wish there were more walls and other fun things but all in all a fun game for free.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Creative way of sharing a serious story . Even though it is for young adults it's a story adults can really get into
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandson at 7 loves challenging games and this proved to be such for him; BUT he has conquered it and gone on to more challenging games. Now his sister (5) is attempting to play it and his twin cousins (also 7) and another at 6 are giving it a go. So overall was well worth getting!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God blessed me with this app It showed me how to walk with God and Its awesome that it comes in so many different languages
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|At first I wasn't sure about this game.. I've playing for about 15 minutes now, and I'm starting to find it addictive
B000MQC9H4|5.0|In many stories, the characters' main struggle is with other characters. That isn't the case here. Each of the five main character's biggest struggle is with themself and their reluctence to let go of old thinking and trust something new. I think this represents life better for most of us than the struggle with ouhers.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story to anyone but especally to anyone who is clinging to old ways that aren't working for them.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love to read and this was exactly what I wanted. I loved these stories and will get more later.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the two characters converging in time. Once you discover what has happened, the plot continues with multiple twists. A great engulfing read!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I bought this for my son at a great price.  We both really love Doctor Who.  Matt Smith is his favorite Doctor.  Series 5 is the one that got him in.  It comes as no surprise to me why this is his favorite.<br /><br />Series 5 brings us a lot of changes.  Of course, a new Doctor, new companions, and new stories.  I also love that it brings us again to River Song.<br /><br />This is a must-have set.  But then again, I think that any dvd set of Doctor Who is a must have set.
1589795474|4.0|the message of this book is great, I got a little lost in the statistics though.  I am grateful for the wakeup call to living a high consumption lifestyle vs a low one...message received.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  That is kind of a lie though, because I am probably the bigger Doctor Who fan.  We have all of the newer Doctor Who episodes on the dvr, so whenever I can get the full seasons at a decent price, I get them to we can delete some of the episodes to hold the newer ones that come on.<br /><br />I hear a lot of things about this Doctor.  Whatever your opinion is of him though, this was still a great series.  It brought back Doctor Who to those who watched it before, but also introduced it to a lot of others.  If you are new to Who, I think that this is where you should start, to get an idea of what the new series of Doctor Who is about.  There are story lines that begin with this series that go on for the second one.
B001VFM60A|5.0|I really like this movie and  its almost like being there in concert. The HD clarity and sound are amazing and when watched on my 65 inch Mitsubishi 3D tv, its simply stunning.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I bought this set to go with my son's other sets.  He loves building and rebuilding this game.  Angry Birds Space is his favorite version of the game.  It is great by itself, but even more fun to combine with the other games for even bigger knock-downs.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I was watching a friend of mine, on our downtime, play this game.  I then downloaded it to my kindle fire and have been having so much fun with it also.  It is very addicting and worth the download.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Cool cars hot woman and team work promoting and protecting life over personal feelings and against all odds. Fun movie and beautiful actors and actresses.
B007U4DDXK|5.0|i recieved this movie quickly and it was a great movie to see<br />kids loved it a lot<br />great show
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was an easy and interesting read.., suspenseful and romantic. Hoover has done her magic yet again with this book!
0807014273|4.0|After the glowing recommendation I received on this book I was expecting more.  Maybe I should have read this 20 years ago and I would have had a different slant, but I have grown weary of listening to victims believing that by surviving the ordeal and then telling the story that they are somehow making up for the less than human behavior they exhibited. The holocaust was inexcusable.  I just didn't feel like I learned anything new from this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game. Gets harder as you go. Becomes quite the brain teaser. Reminds me a little of Trainyard, another brain teaser.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I give this book four stars because of the laughter and the truth of we all have embarrassing middle school years and sibling rivalry between two brothers
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I found the first 100 pages or so very, very dry.  But once, Lincoln wins the Rep. nomination it becomes a fascinating read.  Especially if you enjoy history.  Lincoln becomes REAL!
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Just did not have the story and power of the other movies.  The zing was missing, that used to be there.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|say this movie in the theatre when it came out and i loved it and seeing it in blu ray its like watching it for the first time. the scenery and battle scenes are fantastic
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was fast paced even thought it was somewhat predictable.  The end came as a surprise even though I had guessed what would happen. Me question is how does Jack kill all these people without getting caught?
B001AVCFK6|5.0|enjoyed the movie regardless the story. i think everything is better in high def and sound was really awesome. i would recommend this
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Good music, very funny, light romance, convienant to rent and stream from amazon to the playstaion. Will defiantly watch again
B009E3EY38|5.0|For any Led Zeppelin fan, this is a must have. It has a number of great songs, and it is with today's (2007) technology. The feature Blu-Ray is better than the practice session....
B007PJFIU6|5.0|A review in two parts:<br /><br />If you have never played Dixit: it's an excellent game. This particular copy has the best rules of all the versions. That is not to say you should avoid other Dixit boxes, but this one has been practiced and clarified, it's the one I would pull out to teach any new players.<br /><br />The play is pretty creative, but not so wide-open or embarrassing (like some people may consider charades to be) that you can't get a wide range of people to play. The basic premise is that you have cards with images (unusual and lovely) that you want to get some but not all other players to guess by using some sort of verbal/noise clue. It's a great casual game. I hesitated for a long time before trying it, and now it's one of the standard games my family and friends want to play. Absolutely worth it. Any earlier version is still excellent, this one is just more refined for new players.<br /><br />If you like it, you can buy the other sets to have more cards to play with.<br /><br />For those who have played Dixit: the art style here is different, but the game is essentially unchanged. Journey is as worth the money as any other set just for the deck. The rules sheet is refined and I think the best at balancing the vagueness of Dixit's concept, while still clearly defining how the game works. I use this copy as my go-to for gifting to people, or introducing new players with. If you like having a large set of cards to play with, these ones don't disappoint, but are a clear departure in art style. There are some cards culled from previous sets, so it's not all new either.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you have played Dixit before: do it. Try any set you like or find on sale. It's really a lovely, lovely game.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game was challenging, fun and rewarding. It as also emotionally stirring. Twice I was moved to tears by the culmination of hard work along a brilliant storyline enhanced with serene and breathtaking music. Thank you 2d boy.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|No prince Charming, no romance, just a headstrong daughter who causes a problem and then has to fix it.  The animation was wonderful tho.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've never been a big fan of puzzles, but this has totally changed my mind.....it is fun for kids and adults and a great time passer in the car... I LOVE FLOW FREE'!!!!!!!!!!/
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is the cutest little lego set.  It was given to my niece and she too loves the set and I'm sure she'll play with it often.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO THE ORIGINAL. Could not put it down. Can't wait to read the last of the trilogy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this free app for my new Kindle Fire. It loaded quickly and without problems. I love the game and would recommend.
B008XBASVY|4.0|Definitely worth reading and worth pondering over. Can't say much else for fear of spoilers. It will be interesting to see the movie in relation to the journal
B001BZRUR4|4.0|a good read but the ending was rather abrupt. I liked it as a quick read that kept my interest.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good story and excellent animation. I watched ii twice. A different twist on an old fairy tale. I found it to be most entertaining.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|You are in for the story of a lifetime. Just make sure you have tissues ready! I was literally bawling my eyes out. The twist will definitely surprise you!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A very good film...have watched it many times. Good story line and fabulous special effects. If you have not seen it, take the tiime.
B008KE3960|4.0|Tower defense game that has its challenges. I like the ability to choose loadouts and buy the planes you like, I just dont have the time to play as much as I would like.<br /><br />  if you like tower defense games, this is a great addition and new type of challenge.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. Does an efficient and noteworthy job of connecting to my main computer.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have used this product for some time and became aware that it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  I have attempted to stockpile a supply that will last me for a while.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story is heartwarming, and interesting from start to finish. Perfect for all gals that LOVE to be lost in another romantic story and want to experience the belly fluttering sensation of true love.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I could not get by day to day without my dictionary. I have it on my Kindle and on my iPhone. I use it constantly.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Especially in this day and age. Good material presented in a timely manner. It makes one realize that we are not alone in our stuggles, and that many folks are dealing with the same kinds of things. It is a good mental and emotional pick me up.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I was thrilled to see the new Soundgarden album come out and waited a long time for it. It took me a few listens to really get into it, but now that it has sunk in I keep it in my regular rotation. It reminds me a bit of when Metallica changed their sound from Master of Puppets to the Metallica \\"Black\\" album. It's leaner, but hard edged. \\"Bones of Birds\\" is my favorite track; it's lulls you in  and is haunting at the same time. If it were possible I would give this 4.5 stars, but due to the fact that this album will be in the same career collection as Superunknown and Badmotorfinger I couldn't give it the same 5 starts. I purchased this for $5 on Amazon at a special price instead of the extended version of the album that includes three outtakes of songs already on the CD for $14.99. I saved $10 and made my own extended version by adding the \\"Black Rain\\" single from a few years ago and \\"Live to Rise\\" from The Avengers soundtrack. I really hope they will continue to release more music in the future.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|\\"That's not accurate.\\"  As I read the book that was a common thought that pop-up in my head. The author does not know his history or understand the significance behind HTML5 changes.  If you can get  around these distractions, the author gives an OK overview of what HTML5 has to offer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Have to wonder about one of the main characters.  You feel sorry for her, you hate her, your opinion will change over and over.  And then in the end, you wonder what next.  Hoping for a follow up to find out.  We all like it but hated the way it ended.
1449410243|3.0|There were some funny parts, but it wasn't worth the money. I didn't like that the cat uses the GD curse. I am a Christian and I tend to flinch whenever I read/hear it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Still reading this one, it was a book club pick.  The details to the time period are good.  Tells the story  from several sides and several characters so you really get the entire feel of plantation life and a woman's station from then.  Highly recommend this read.
B008KW43TE|1.0|Seriously this album is bad, I bought into the hype and purchased it, wish I vould get my money back. However if You like Miguels knewest album Kaleidoscope dreams you probaly love this, if you dont youll hate this one to.
0385535147|5.0|Nothing like having a Mississippi boy do good!!!  John always thrills with his writing and always takes you to the brim and delivers.  Way to go, John!!!!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I have watched these movies for years but it seems like the writers/producers are starting to lose interest in the series.  Typical killing of all the good guys until none are left and few surprises.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This product is right on time. It take beautiful pictures and is so easy to use. Love the Kindle products.
B001E7EONC|5.0|If you are a Jason Statham fan, enjoy British film/tv or just like to watch a captivating movie this is a good buy.  It usually takes me 10/20 minutes to pick out a movie but Jason never let's me down.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was fascinating and was exciting to read. At the end I was addicted! Definitely worth the read to me.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Pretty good for a love story.  Special effects were decent.  Some of the scenery was nice too.  If the sequel was REALLY well written and acted I would buy it.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My kids and I rewatched this a few weeks ago (they are 12 and 8) and we still enjoyed this movie.  They were looking at me so strangely because I still know all of the songs.  I love that the &#34;hero&#34; is actually a heroine in a culture and time that doesn't value women.  Most children's movies are all about the guy saving the girl, but Mulan saves her father, her commanding officer and China!
B004CEUEWE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and you can find several movie reviews elsewhere. Since this is an Amazon.com product, here is my review of such.<br />As part of &#34;Digital&#34; products being offered my Amazon.com, I would like to point out that the XBOX interface is better than netflix, its faster to load and navigate. However, there is no option for subtitles for this movie, which makes it difficult to watch when you have kids or other members of the house sleeping in adjacent rooms. The Amazon app on XBOX lacks the ability to purchase new content, I think thats partly due to the way purchase options are set up on XBOX. On PS3 app for Amazon, the interface is just as quick, however it adds the ability to purchase new content and add it to your video library.
B001U887MO|4.0|These Crocs are great for crossing semi-slippery surfaces that occur in the mountains.  The liner, however, is difficult to remove for washing, and does not wash up as nicely as I'd hoped.  They are, however, great for around the yard use.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I do a lot of travel and outdoor photography. I saved lots of cash when I purchased this pack and can take all of the lens and accessories I normally used for my photography. It is comfortable and easy to setup in several configurations depending on what equipment you want to carry.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|The DVD came damaged. There was damage to the cover and the paper had several holes in the front. Furthermore, the product itself had damage. The DVD did not play properly - there were lines moving across the screen the entire time. I could not even watch the movie. I've never ordered a DVD online before this, and I am extremely discouraged from purchasing anything else with Amazon let alone another DVD. I am a frequent customer on this site and I normally speak volumes of your customer service and product quality, however this is seriously disappointing to me.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved. Totally captivating. I cannot wait to read the next two books. I don't know what to expect but I do know I probably won't be disappointed.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm not sure if anyone has considered it, but this is an amazing read and would translate well into a movie....!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was useless to myself and my family till I finished the book. Do not start if you have deadlines to meet!
B009JBZH54|4.0|a great collection for the nolan batman fan. the 3 films in glorious blu ray and the 2 bonus discs give a great collection to own for batman fans.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|the levels are simple at the beginning but get progresivly harder. Also there are different endings to some levels so if you're stuck you won't nessasarily (that might be spelled wrong) be stuck for weeks. plus you get to draw your character which is different.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|i remember the first killers album being wow! the second on being a different album but still very good and then the third one having some very good points. but this............................if your lacking sleep, buy this album. its so boring. it seems Brandon Flowers solo work has really played a apart in this album. dull is just the only word i can use to describe this album. its all the same and very disappointing!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Have not read yet-but so excited that I could not pass this deal up! Can't wait to read it soon!
B000001E8P|5.0|a great great album at the peak of britpop, this was one of the seminal albums. its worth owning just cause at the regeneration of british music this was on the centrepieces. full of references to working northern class life and angst. the stand out track being common people gives you a lesson in some brilliant music!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Worth the price we paid for this! Funny movie! Glad to add it for a great gift this season too!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Picked it up for free but think it is well worth the low price tag. Plus the graphics are adorable.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a great deal for this movie as well! The price was perfect for the gift that it became!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I love both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  They make this film believable and I enjoyed every minute.  It was filled with emotion from sadness to happiness and it had a good ending.
B00138EV8U|5.0|Loved this movie growing up and love that I can listen to the music whenever I want now as easy as 1 2 3!
B004TP6O8O|5.0|This album is basicly his best songs made compiled into a single album. It is missing a few others but overall it's probably the best in my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book, loved the characters and the way they were described. Nicolas sparks has dome it again. Can't wait fir the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|SO GOOD I couldn't put it down.. loved it for sure. Definitely hits you in the heart, even brought a couple tears to my eyes.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Maybe I missed it in the description, but this is a widescreen DVD.  It comes with a Bonus disc (I believe it's a &#34;making of&#34; DVD) and also a poster for the movie.  The poster is rather small at, maybe, a foot by 1 1/2 feet, but it's something that I didn't expect to receive, so, for about $15 you get all that AND it's a movie of &#34;The Wall&#34;!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I bought this book without reading anything about it.  I was in my buying books by how cool the cover looks moods and this one was a part of the bundle that ended up on my kindle.  So I had no idea what kind of book it was or if the writing was going to be worth sticking around for.  When I first started it and realized the story centered around the life of a teenage girl I was a bit upset.  I hate teen books.  I don't want to go back and re-live my teens and I don't really want to read about it either.  But I had bought the book and I was going to finish it no matter what.  And I'm glad I did because I can honestly say that I'm blown away.  Colleen Hoover took me on an unexpected ride.  Skye (the main character) is smart, funny and unlike any teen I remember being around, but wish I was like when I was her age.  Holden is just straight up sexy, and their relationship is filled with angst, humor and a lot of hot moments.  Just when I thought the story was going somewhere it takes this wild turn and I'm re-hooked into it.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because at the end it got to be a bit preachy.  Skye's point was made through out the whole book and I didn't really feel the need for her to repeat it at the end.  It made the story lose it's realism and head into the corny category.  But I'm only talking about the last 3 to 5 pages. So glad I bought this book!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Likable character.  Decided to read after seeing previews for the Reacher movie.  Will continue to read the series until the plots are easily predictable.
B004H1YH66|5.0|Ouf, what a blast!!! You can feel the power of all the musicians, blowing that extraordinary soundtrack wich is, according to me, the best soundtrack of all movies. Just a point: keep your old Milan version, as the latter is more \\"raw\\" and even better! But it is my taste.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works just as advertised.  I went with the Apple product because of listed problems with the aftermarket version...  The other reviews were correct.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This movie really gets your attention and keeps you wondering.  I watched it twice to make sure I followed the whole movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have always loved reading John Grisham. It so easy for me to get caught up in his stories.This book was an easy read.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries but doesn't have a lot of time to read a long involved book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My husband loves Star Wars...ok, so do I. So glad to have all the movies on Blu ray to break out and watch every now and again. He actually just watched a couple of the originals yesterday!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|We watch it every year, and it makes me laugh at the same places every year. Jim Carrey is just a stinking genius.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for a friend.  Unfortunately, we waited to late to play the discs and discovered they did not read or work.  :/
B007MDB548|5.0|This movie has a very cute story line and the characters are fun and interesting.  I was really impressed and my daughter loves watching it -- over and over.
B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Really enjoy this album, different sound than most bands. Catchy tunes with some depth as well. I liked all songs except troublemaker and it wasn't bad by any means. Also, this is a cohesive album with an underlying concept. Listen to it as a whole and you will appreciate it more.  My only complaint is the 8 minutes of silence after Irene until the final song. Found this not a very good idea. Tried to listen to a bit of their previous album , many people liked it better, I think Bloom is much better. 4.5 from me.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|It was good to read the first Reacher book. I never knew how he got out of the Army. I have read all the other books.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I thought this book was very entertaining had turns in the story that were not expected. I thought it was weird at the first but the more you read the more interesting and the more you want to read. I thought it was a good book.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a great soundtrack and if you close your eyes you can imagine the movie all over again! Love it!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Again another brilliant movie by Clint Eastwood. It is well acted, crafted and directed. Eastwood just gets better with age just like a good wine. He always seems to pick the right actors which makes a great ensemble for this and all his movies. The acting is never overstated. Eastwood playing a baseball scout who is going blind and his estranged daughter who reluctantly agrees to help him, with the prodding of his friend, is a nice dynamic. Again an enjoyable and touching movie which everyone has come to expect from an Eastwood movie.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very simple and easy to follow. It made the next step very understandable. format is also easy to follow and read.
1419705849|5.0|I was happy to find this book on line at a great price. It was a last minute gift I forgot to pick up and was dreading another trip to walmart! my son loves these books and it made for great reading over xmas break.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Everything about this Deluxe Box set is worth every penny!! I personally enjoyed watching both the Live concert in London and RATM's first concert back in 1991. The quality on both the sound and picture are awesome! I hope they do something similar w/ Evil Empire!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This was a great deal..pre order match the lowest available price. was delivered before christmas and made a wonderful family movie! We all sat down with full bellys and laughed together! We have already watched it multiple times and have it memorized! Hilarious!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This would be a great movie if you we're blind and deaf.  Here are the eight more that I need.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I really love this album. The infusion of melodic, soothing vocals and raw passionate lyrics made me an instant fan of the weeknd's music. There are give or take about thirty songs on this album and I like about 26 of them.  However, I can recognize that this album might not be for everyone. It doesn't encompass the typical cookie cutter songs but details what seems to be authentic struggles  of someone dealing with love, power, and partying in this century.
0670024813|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00I2GDTF2 An Executive Summary of Jared Diamond's 'The World Unitl Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies']]<br /><br />The main argument: The onset of agriculture and farming some 11,000 years ago (termed the Neolithic Revolution), is arguably the most significant turning point in the history of our species. Agriculture induced a major population explosion, which then led to urbanization; labor specialization; social stratification; and formalized governance--thus ultimately bringing us to civilization as we know it today. Prior to the Neolithic Revolution--and extending back time out of mind--human beings lived in a far different way. Specifically, our ancestors lived in small, largely egalitarian tribes of no more than 50 to 100 individuals, and hunted and foraged for their food.<br /><br />The transition from our traditional hunting and gathering lifestyle, to early farming (and herding), to civilization as we know it now (which, on an evolutionary time-scale, occurred but yesterday) has certainly brought with it some very impressive benefits. Indeed, many of us today enjoy comforts and opportunities the likes of which our more traditional ancestors would never have dreamed of. However, it cannot be said that the transition from traditional to modern has left us without any difficulties. Indeed, some would go so far as to say that the problems that civilization has introduced outweigh the benefits that it has brought; and even the most unromantic among us are likely to agree that our experiment in civilization has not been an unmitigated success.<br /><br />This then brings us to the problem of solving the difficulties that civilization has left us with. Now, when it comes to solving our problems, it is without a doubt the spirit of our age to look ever forward for solutions--by which I mean we tend to look for new technologies and hitherto untested arrangements to help us out of our current predicaments. However, when we consider that our traditional lifestyle served us well for millennia on end, and that it was under this lifestyle wherein we underwent much of the biological and psychological evolution that lives with us to this day, we can begin to see how it may be fruitful to look back at this traditional lifestyle for possible solutions to the problems we now face. (This idea is not new; indeed, the `state of nature' has traditionally been of great interest to philosophers--for it has been thought that understanding how we lived by nature may serve as a guide to help us design the most fitting political communities given our present circumstances).<br /><br />Also of interest here--and deeply connected to the more practical goal mentioned above--is that investigating our traditional way of life promises to shed light on our underlying human nature in a way that is not possible when we look at ourselves through the obscuring artifice of civilization. It is these things that we stand to gain by learning about traditional societies, and it is this very project that geographer Jared Diamond takes up in his new book The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies?<br /><br />Diamond is certainly not one to deny that civilization has brought with it many important benefits over our traditional way of life (the most important of which, according to the author, being that state governments are much more effective at ending the cycles of violence that tend to plague traditional societies). However, Diamond does contend that there are many areas wherein traditional practices represent an improvement over how we do things in the modern world, and that these practices could (and should) be incorporated into our modern way of life (both at the personal and societal level). Specifically, we could afford to learn a thing or two from traditional societies when it comes to conflict resolution (how to re-establish and mend relationships);raising children (that it really does take a whole village to raise a child); treating the elderly (that they are deserving of respect, and are still capable of contributing to the community in many important ways); approaching risk (with extensive caution); communicating (in a face to face way, and with multiple languages); and in diet and exercise (favoring natural foods, reducing salt, and sugar intake, and adopting a more active lifestyle).<br /><br />In the course of his exploration of traditional societies, Diamond also delves into why and how our ancestors transitioned from traditional societies to civilizations (with a focus on such areas as social, economic and political stratification, and also religion).<br /><br />Diamond has made a career out of studying the traditional societies of Papua New Guinea, and is therefore a very credible authority on the subject matter at hand. What's more, his wealth of experience has left him with a trove of interesting and illuminating anecdotes to draw from, and these are on full display here. Finally, I felt that the author always maintained a very sober and balanced view with regards to the benefits and drawbacks of both traditional and modern societies. I would have liked to have seen certain topics discussed more, and others less, but this is mere personal preference. Altogether a very good book.

B008FSCNTK|5.0|Just a nice, sultry, relaxing jazzy, catchy CD. Next itme you have friends over, put it on. Everyone will ask: Who is that?
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious movie, just silly with some good tunes! Fat Amy was, by far, my favorite part! Mermaid dancing, a lot of floor work!
B008469DGY|4.0|I have enjoyed Flick Golf over my Christmas break.  I can't stop playing.  I love real golf, but this a very nice substitute.
034580404X|5.0|I know people seem to either love or hate this series.  I am a huge fan, love the whole thing.  People need to be open to the idea to 'think outside of the box' and this provides that inspiration.  I loved the 'Gray' book so much that I purchased the trilogy and was not disappointed.
0316232955|5.0|It was a christmas present for my daughter. It arrived in plenty of time and she can't wait to read it.
B007P3Q95K|5.0|Richard II - 5 STARS.<br />Perfect acting, incredible story, gorgeous costumes, beautiful cinematography. By far the best of the four, and mostly because of an electrifying performance by Ben Whishaw (Cloud Atlas, Skyfall).<br />I asked myself why I hadn't seen Whishaw more often!<br />His performance as Richard II is towering, electrifying, chameleon-like, moving, disturbing, delicate, multi-faceted, and most of all, brilliant.<br />A phenomenal performance, and worthy of much praise indeed.<br /><br />The supporting cast more than holds it's own:<br />Patrick Stewart (always great, but sadly he leaves the narrative rather early), Clemence Po&eacute;sy (a great, underrated French actress), David Suchet (reliable as ever), and Rory Kinnear (Who's Bolingbroke \\"bursts with valour and courage\\").<br /><br />But let us give credit to where credit is due. Shakespeare...was one damn fine writer!<br /><br />BEST SPEECH (delivered gloriously by Ben Whishaw):<br />For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground<br />And tell sad stories of the death of kings;<br />How some have been deposed; some slain in war,<br />Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;<br />Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;<br />All murder'd: for within the hollow crown<br />That rounds the mortal temples of a king<br />Keeps Death his court...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Henry IV Part 1 - 4 STARS.<br />Jeremy Irons is one of the finest Shakespearean actors to ever live. His Henry IV is a sharp contrast to Whishaw's Richard. Richard is pious, noble, weak-hearted, and entirely eligible to be king. Henry is strong, prepared, diligent, hard, and a usurper.<br />And there you see the problem. Richard was the rightful king, yet he was not a good ruler. Henry was a traitor, banished by Richard, yet it was he should sit on the throne of England.<br />It was not until Henry's son - Prince Hal, would sit on the throne of England as Henry V, that England would have a ruler that was both ready and legitimate.<br /><br />And as Prof. Peter Saccio (a renowned Shakespearean scholar) points out, overthrowing a king (as in what Henry IV did to Richard II) proves to others that a king can be overthrown.<br />So it is with great certainty that Irons's Henry proclaims:<br />\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.\\"<br />...<br />Henry IV, Part 1 has a great cast, led by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons.<br />In the supporting cast we see: Tom Hiddleston (Mentored by Kenneth Branagh, Tom is an excellent actor, as adept at playing Loki as playing Prince Hal), Simon Russell Beale (a most excellent Falstaff - perfectly capturing Sir John's mix of charisma and loathsomeness), Julie Walters, and Joe Armstrong (a fine, impulsive Hotspur).<br />On the whole, the cast is as well chosen, experienced, and star-studded as you could expect from a BBC Two Production produced by Sam Mendes (Skyfall).<br />...<br />So far so good, Henry IV, Part 1 has a stellar cast, luscious costumes, a battle scene or two, a heroic speech here and there...What's not to like?<br />I'll tell you - the lack of Jeremy Irons.<br />Yes, the Oscar winning actor has a very small screen time - the majority of the play given to raunchy tavern scenes, and political intrigue in Scotland. I saw disappointingly little of Irons in this adaptation, but on the whole, I loved it!<br /><br />...<br /><br />Henry IV Part 2 - 3 STARS.<br />Ian McEwan (Game of Thrones) co-stars in this one. Sadly, I didn't find this one at all as interesting as the previous wins.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Henry V - 5 STARS.<br />In my opinion, Henry V is the greatest play in the Henriad, and one of Shakespeare's greatest ever history plays (other greats would include Richard II, III, and Julius Caesar). There is quite simply, something for everybody here. Whether you love action, romance, political intrigue, drama, or historical fiction, you will love Henry V.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the greatest things about Henry V is that it gives the title actor room to shine. And there have been many great portrayals of the warrior king, over the years. In film, there have been only 3:<br /><br />1. Laurence Olivier, who starred and directed in a very famous 1944 adaptation of [[ASIN:0780021320 Henry V (The Criterion Collection)]]. This film was released during WWII, and depicts the English as strong, valiant, heroic soldiers, and the French as pompous, foolish, and decadent.<br />Everything about this film was meant to boost morale during the darkest time during English history.<br />In short, it was thinly veiled British propaganda. And by Jove did it work. It was a serious morale booster.<br /><br />2. Kenneth Branagh, who starred and directed in an acclaimed 1989 [[ASIN:079284615X Henry V]]. The great Branagh's first film, Henry V co-featured a star-studded, immensely talented supporting cast.

Tom Hiddleston, who stars in a 2012 adaptation directed by Thea Sharrock, released by BBC. Hiddleston was younger than Olivier when he played Henry, but a year older than Branagh. The actor (fresh from playing the foolish, care-free Prince Hal) is surrounded by older players, so the end result is a Henry quite young, fresh from the death of his father, and forced to play a large role in the affairs of state.<br /><br />But it's nothing less then compelling. I have always wondered how Henry the Fifth made the transition from Hal the playboy, the rascal, to Henry V, the warrior, the man. Tom Hiddleston manages the transition perfectly. His Henry is one charismatic, grave, and cerebral.<br />An excellent, fresh take on a classic play.<br />...<br />The film itself is well shot, and the action scenes are good. The supporting cast lacks the star factor, but none of the talent, of the previous films - with Julie Walters returning as Mistress Quickly, and John Hurt as Chorus.<br /><br />However, Henry V suffers from a lack of visual grandeur. In Branagh's film, the King delivers the disturbing Harfleur speech from a rearing stallion, surrounded by fire and the carnage of battle. In The Hollow Crown, Hiddleston delivers the speech with equal gusto, but this time it is on a bridge, on the back of a complacent mount, with the fat mayor of Harfleur standing a few yards from him.<br />And what of the most famous speech in the play - perhaps of ANY Shakespeare play save Hamlet - the \\"St. Crispin's Day\\" Speech? Kenneth Branagh delivers it on the top of supply wagons, surrounded by a hundred soldiers, to a rousing Patrick Doyle score.

B005EVVESM|5.0|It arrived on time and was just as described.  It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time IS truly unlike any other whodunit murder mystery you have ever read. I guarantee it.<br /><br />The victim: Wellington, a poodle.<br />The sleuth: Christopher Boone, a 15 year old boy with Asperger's Syndrome.<br />The suspects: Christopher's neighbours.<br /><br />Mark Haddon, the author, shows a marvelous grasp of words and language. Through Christopher's eyes, he shows us the world in a way we have never viewed it.<br />The plot, too, is breezy and easy to read. It's quite riveting, actually. The premise is ingenious, original, and smart.<br />It bears all the marks of a crime/fiction/black comedy classic.<br /><br />So what is the problem with the novel? Christopher Boone.<br /><br />...<br /><br />It's hard to like a book when, if you met the protagonist, you would probably want to punch him in the face. As I read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, I found myself hating the main character.<br />This is, in some ways, a testament to the writing prowess of Mark Haddon. Christopher is a strong, well-formed character. He is realistic, although Mark Haddon says that Christopher was based on 2 people he knew - neither of which had Asperger's Syndrome, and, even in the opening pages of the novel, has a unique and individual voice that saturates the narrative.<br /><br />But I really found myself disliking him, especially in one scene, where he discovers the body of Wellington the dog. The police arrive, and he strikes one of them. Christopher lies down in the grass. \\"I lay down in the grass. It felt good.\\" Christopher carries around a small pocket knife, and imagines stabbing people if they came too<br />close. He goes into in deep detail about his urinating. He is nosy, rude, and cannot understand human emotions.<br />He is, quite simply, not a likeable character. Kind of like the little boy in Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, but worse.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But Dog in the Night-Time is not a murder mystery, or a book about Asperger's Syndrome. It is a book about outcasts, and being accepted. Mark Haddon said of his book, \\"[It] is not a book about Asperger's....if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. The book is not specifically about any specific disorder \\"<br /><br />And as that, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time succeeds completely, brilliantly, movingly. However, the book fails pertaining to it's main character Christopher Boone - a character I did not like at all.<br />But I think that this book is a success, and above all, I think that YOU SHOULD READ IT and judge for yourself.<br /><br />3.7 Stars.murder mystery, or a book about Asperger's Syndrome.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is not one show of this series that I do not appreciate. It is slow sometimes, but is a great show overall. I highly recommend checking out this TV series and the comics under the same name.

B00ATPVA78|3.0|spirit walkers is an OK game leaning towards the cheesy side in my opinion. I only played up to the $4.99 unlock and I stopped. Didn't feel that this particular game warrents the price. Maybe 2.99 not sure.
1609611543|3.0|Informative about the wheat issue. The recipes are good, but not great. Had also bought the Wheat Belly Cookbook in the hopes of a better variety of recipes.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really liked this book because of the very descriptive first person point of view through Ana's eyes. Christian Grey is guarded, kinda creepy, sweet & \\"sex on a stick\\" like Alexander Skarsgard  from \\"True Blood.\\"They both (more he than she) make BDSM seem like it's worth a shot & it really gets stuck in your head. Lol! Like many others, I was skeptical, but my friends talked me into it. Now I can't wait to read \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\" I'm officially hooked & recommend this for a mature female around the age of 21 & older.
B009329Y30|2.0|This was a Hallmark Channel special at best, how did this make it into theaters?? Not horrible but ...... even my girlfriend thought it was a dud.
0399157565|1.0|I received this book for Christmas and just finished it.  It is barely worth your time, believe me.  The plot is excellent, but the character development is shallow.  Dialogue is ordinary and repetitive and Scarpetta is distractingly narcissistic.  It would be better if cut in half.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when I thought I knew the twist, there were more surprises down the road. A thoroughly enjoyable read! Recommended.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|very funny, witty.  HIghly recommend.Great acting by big names.  A real sleeper and well worth your time.  Good for the whole family.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I almost didn't watch the DVD. I was alone in my house, at night -- did I really want to watch a desperate struggle between man and wolf, on my big TV with full surround sound? Maybe it would be too intense -- too painful.<br /><br />It was indeed intense, and at times painful. But it was also beautiful, and compelling.<br /><br />The men -- hardened oil workers at an isolated outpost whose plane crashes on the way back to Anchorage -- are dropped into a terrible situation. In the end, they maintain their humanity. They admit how much they want to survive, to see their child again, or to have sex one more time. They admit how scared they are. They ... well, you should see it for yourself.<br /><br />At one point, I found myself thinking that the title was poorly chosen. I thought \\"The Grey\\" referred to one giant alpha wolf, with whom Liam Neeson's character would go one on one. And when that didn't seem to be happening, I felt misled.<br /><br />But then I thought, maybe the title actually refers to Neeson's character. He is, in a way, caught between life and death, between blackness and color. Maybe he's The Grey.<br /><br />The film is also, in part, anti-religious, while being deeply humanistic. Neeson's character finds value in the immediate physical truths of life, and the human connections, rather than thoughts of the hereafter.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a very good book.  Lots of whimsy and mystery.  I have recommended this to most of my family!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I would consider this show flawless except for one thing. The way in which Carrie's illness is portrayed is inaccurate, especially the administering of her ECT. Having been through many treatments myself, the reality is far from what the episode portrayed. There are no mouth guards inserted and most especially the body moves so serenely it is barely disernible. Having said this I cannot fault with much else. The plot line, acting, suspense and overall show itself is a sure winner!
0525952926|5.0|Excellent reading.  Very well written- great detail.  Love this author.  This author take time to entertain his readers.  I would recommend this book to people that love to read.  It takes you to the time period and you feel apart of the message begin conveyed.
1416583432|5.0|Fabulous read! A must for any dog owner that simply loves their pup. The author not only knows how to educate, she writes in an entertaining manner that keeps the pages turning. The best part is that she allows a dog lover like myself to enjoy my pup without formal training. Walks with my dog are more enjoyable and I look at him in a whole new way because I understand more of what he \\". . . sees, smells and knows.\\" Read and Enjoy!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I bought this a few weeks ago but only recently had time to watch it.<br />All I can say is wow.<br />This is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen on my Samsung 55\\" 3D television.<br />I don't want to go into much detail regarding the movie itself since almost everyone has already seen it or at least heard about it; I mainly just wanted to throw my 2 cents in regarding the 3D aspects.<br /><br />The 3D rendering is fantastic. Obviously nothing will compare to IMAX but this is about as close as you can get in the comfort of your own living room. This movie was made for 3D. The colors and just the scope of the sequences filmed on the alien planet are set up perfectly for 3D.<br /><br />Overall I think it was fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a 3D television; you will not be disappointed!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved this movie and I'm normally not a super hero move kind of fan by and large.  Smart writing with clever dialogue and a great ride!  This is one of the really good ones to add to your collection, particularly if you're a fan of ANY of the characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know there are not as many features as the pc and Xbox version, but there will be updates. Even if they never update it, it's still worth the money, but it's certain they will, as they already announced some of the future updates. If you are considering buying this app, I think you should get it. It's worth the money.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoy playing this type of game. I only wish that they would make them faster so that I wouldn't have to waste time playing the crappy games.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am not overly critical, but never give 5 stars for a book. But this is a well written book that is gripping from the beginning to the end. I could not set it down. Well done.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|I was so excited to see this movie come out as when my 30 year old kids were little they loved it!  I bought the movie for my 30 year old son who liked the smurfs the most.  Great family movie!
B005HSL626|4.0|great clean kids game...I love it also, but it does freeze up a bit too much on my kindle...but can't complain for it being free!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|As always, Reacher at his finest. Child throws in enough clues to keep you confused to the end. Great read.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love being able to look up words on my Kindlefire when reading ebooks. So, I purchased this app to use when reading non ebooks. It is great and very easy to use. I definitely would recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has left me with a tear stained face and lots of thoughts about life, love and living! This is amazing story that everyone needs to read. This book makes you think about your own life and the choices you make and if you had borrow time would thoughs choices be different?  Beautiful read with a storyline that will leave you breathless!!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The action was good and the acting was okay. There was more acting in the original TR. Digital action was very good.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I downloaded the program from amazon and the program timed out twice and the quality of the image was poor.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|It was slow moving but the few action moments it had were OK. This seemed to be more of teen movie.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Contrary to some reports, a minor amount of digital tweaking was left in this transfer of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But on the whole, the films look just gorgeous on Blu-Ray!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great action movie. Good acting. This movie left me with a good feeling. My grandchildren liked it very much which is different because it is something they do not watch very often.
B0087UNURU|5.0|After watching Graceland on PBS, I just had to have the album and this one even includes some of the video of Simon's tour to create the album. Before seeing the PBS special, I merely enjoyed a couple of the tunes. Now I have a totally different impression of Paul Simon and the impact that he and his music has had on this world. What a legacy Paul Simon will leave. I also have to say that Amazon makes buying, storing and listening to music soooo easy - thanks Amazon!
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|This was not as good as the previous RE series. This left it open for another RE. I thought this was an end to RE but I guess not.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in-1 games is a great time killer. kids love it.  there are a lot of choices.  super addictive . hlepfull with quite time
0920668372|5.0|\\"Love You Forever\\" was given to me as a gift when my twin daughters were 4, their 24 now, and I would read this book to them quite often, it left us very touched, caring for one another. I recommend this classic story for all. You not too old to read it. Share the story with your family..God Bless
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Extremely well written.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a compelling story teller, and you are drawn in to the world of Lincoln.  She obviously has a lot of affection for your subject, and, because of the book, you start to as well.  Even though you KNOW how the story will end (if you paid any attention to your middle school American History class), it's still saddening, because your understanding of this great President has grown so much.  Loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Who can't want s to see the next book of the awesome hero's of Olympus series the house of hades
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A truly great look at our habits, why we do the things we do, and how we can change them.  A clear breakdown of how habits are made and how they can be altered.  Great writing pulls it all together.  I devoured it in one day.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book I ever read in my life it was action pack. I could not put this book down I would recommend this book to everyone
B0001932ZA|5.0|I watched this movie all the time growing up and always loved it.  I was happy to find it on Amazon for sale and pleased that it was still a fun movie to watch.  Granted that the movie is a number of years old it is still entertaining and a good movie!  I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Arnold!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was too short lol. Lots of connections were able to be made in my own relationship and it made it that much better. Easy read, good read.
B009MO5960|4.0|The movie was good and if you like the other Resident Evil's this one will not dissapoint.  I am tired of movies coming out as 3D and sacrificing story line and acting for the sake of more CGI and 3D visuals.  The first and second movies are still my favorite of the series so I am hoping that for the next movie they go back to their roots!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My 13 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas. I got it for her and we enjoyed the action together.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The movie is done in a very unique fashion.  The general story follows a young girl as she is forced into performing for patrons of the establishment that she resides.  Without spoiling anything I want to say that the movie is done in such a way that there are stories within stories.  The movie involves trips to other worlds and locales where the main character along with her friends go on various missions.  I recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys imaginative action/drama movies.
1451695195|5.0|My wife wanted this book and enjoyed the whold story. She is a physician in the midst of physician skeptics so this gave her faith in heaven support. She sent it to her skeptic brother in the hope he might find faith also.
B00APUQT7I|2.0|Did not enjoy this animation film because of the characters. No warmth in any of them which is disappointing for a children's film. Hard to get by the associations of the adult voices with previous characters they have played as well as the dialog. So many better choices out there.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|My daughter purchased this book series with my permission on my kindle. She loves the story. When we talk about it,it sounds like cowboys and indians in space. It has been an opportunity to talk about dystopian literature and how plotlines work. Fun and literate work.
B002361MLA|5.0|My wife was reliving mistakes she had made over and over, what I came to call her &#34;woulda, coulda, shoula&#34; paradigm until she read The Power of Now.  If gave her a new perspective and the quality of her life improved in some important ways.  Highly recommended.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I just saw the recent movie and enjoyed it. It was well done. I wanted to follow up with the book to discover the nuances.
B00000DHTF|5.0|If you are a Springsteen fan, Tracks is a must addition to your collection. These mostly unreleased or little known Springsteen songs from the 80s and 90s illustrate the breadth and depth of his talent. These songs that were deemed not good enough for a major album release are better than 90% of what is put out by many other rockers. Get Tracks, turn the volume up, and listen.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I loved this movie. It's funny and nicely done about how a marriage can be rejuvenated after it became all routine. I recommend it for couples who's kids don't live with them anymore.
0545425115|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas. I should have bought another for his sister because they immediately began to argue over who was going to get to read it first!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I usually don't like remakes, but this one is very nicely done. The original story has been altered so it is very entertaining again. Also great ideas about our possible way of life in the future. A great cast just further improves the quality of this movie. Enjoy!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Loved the strong connection between man and animal.  Loved that the boy never gave up looking for his companion as animals do for their humans.
0307472590|5.0|During my stay in Barcelona, I asked our guide what would be a good book about the city and she suggested Zafon's &#34;La Sombra del Viento.&#34;  It is a great book, in clear Spanish, with beautiful character development, a bit of mysticism, and enough human interest to keep one glued to its tail.<br />El lenguaje es simple y educado.  El misterio, la historia de la juventud en Barcelona, el cuento sobre el amor primero y su disolución, la descripción de Barcelona, todo mantiene el interés del leyente.  Me gustó mucho.<br />León
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Except to say I am completely hooked!  I absolutely love Downton Abbey.  It is such a rich, wonderful series.  I want more.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Would love to see the companion TV show, but I don't watch TV!  This is a must-read for most in the US, as it contains a wealth of information NOT taught in schools...it shows a much bigger picture of US history, much like Zinn's  A People's History of the United States
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book ever greatly detailed good description good job! I really hope there will be a 2nd book I just loved it
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Glad I waited to see this movie till it was on DVD. Ok if you need to kill 2 hours.
B003719G40|3.0|I bought it for my kindle, for better ease of transportation.  unfortunately, I guess neither the CD, Hard Cover or Kindle edition helped.  My wife still left.  Seemed that it wasn't the languages at all, it was another...  Well, the languages didn't really help
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I decided to read this book because of the hype created by it. Reviews had said that it made you believe in God; however, I was disappointed in the fact that it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.<br /><br />The Positives:<br />Imagery was great! My love for animals made me appreciate the wonderful beauty of the Earth. There was also very good information on zoo keeping, and animal behaviors that I had not known of. The whole philosophical aspect of the book also intrigued me. The incorporation of major world religions, and the author's knowledge about them also surprised me.<br /><br />The Negatives:<br />It felt like a very slow read, and was drawn out more than it was supposed to. At one point I had to put the book down for a week, and forced myself to start reading it again because I wanted to know what happened. I thought that the whole book had a deeper meaning behind it; however, I read one of the author's interviews and he had said that there wasn't a drawn out deeper meaning but what the audience wanted to believe in at the end. There was also a lot of Hindi words/foods/Hindu gods incorporated in the book, which was fine with me because I understood most of them; however, to the audience that doesn't know the words, it might be a little difficult to understand the context around the words.<br /><br />And I must say: Richard Parker was my FAVORITE character.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|Great tale of the little guy getting the last word; rightfully so. Plausible at any time. Good characters. Couple  hour read.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Written in a nice easy flowing style. I liked the little bits written by his wife in between.He has just enough balance between the technical stuff, field experiences and the ever present politics in these conflicts.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|It just keeps getting better instead of bogged down like some shows do. I laugh the entire episode at the geekery
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is so cool. it rox and i cant put my kindle fire down!works great .really cool graphics .weird, but cool.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up Married was a very cute well written story!  I enjoyed the plot, and the humor.  There was enough sexual tension without going into too graphic detail.  The characters were very likable.  Even though it wasn't completely believable it was an awesome story and one I was able to read in one day and made me want to read more titles by this author!  I would definitely reccommend this book to anyone who loves quirky romance novels that make you laugh, while retaining your attention and make you want to continue to read to find out what is happening next. It's predictable but, very good!
B009LREA1S|5.0|I cant describe it, probably the best plot/action, gadget batman ever. Its dark and ominous and just very well written. Man, just blown away.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it is a lot of fun to play..  It is relaxing and sometimes challenging and great.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|CD, whatever, it's just a great set of music, liked them for what I heard on the radio mostly &#34;The Cave&#34; and &#34;Little Lion Man&#34; And now I like the whole CD, not a bad song on the whole thing!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My got this got my boys 4 &6. They love it and caught into it really fast. I am looking into the other Dr. ones too.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  This is a love story but also a story of compassion and revelation.  There are twists that keep you guessing right up until the end.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this one!
B005KMX866|5.0|What is better than Chris Isaak, nothing, except when he does the cover songs from past artists.  Many of these artist were from another era.  But these guys are timeless.  Thanks Chris Isaak...love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I adored the first two books by Colleen and was thrilled to see a new book with her name on it. This book exceeded my expectations. Her writing is genuine and full of heart. I picked it up and finished it in a day. Colleen has a gift for shocking you when you least expect it. She takes her stories for twists & turns but completes the story. You finish the book with no questions. She is marked as one of my favorite authors and I will not hesitate buying any of her books in the future. If you are considering this book, there is no question, this is a must read.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is probably the most addicting book series I have ever read. Catching Fire I think is the best book in the series.

B001RTCP1A|5.0|One of the best Vin Diesel movies I think. I love this movie, probably my favorite of its genre. Blu ray makes it even better.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is the best compund you can really use for any cpu, gpu, or whatever else yo have that needs compound added to it. Used it in my gaming rig.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|always a classic and so we bought this so we would not have to wait for the TV versions with all of the commercials! extra materials were a bonus as well.
0670024813|5.0|I learned 2 new things from the book:<br /><br />1) In traditional societies, it was normal for people to be talking all of the time - narrating and sharing their thoughts, ideas and feelings. This explains why people are so attracted to data dumps like Twitter and Fakebook. The computer provides an outlet because nobody really wants to listen.<br /><br />2)Status goods have a very long history. Explains why expensive sunglasses, handbags and shoes still matter to most people. Apple is the master of<br />status goods for now, thus they can set high prices, which reinforces the status aspect.<br /><br />Nice work, Jared.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book! It was an exciting read and I am now hooked on this plot. I'm definitely going to get the next book. I'm so happy to find a new series to read.

B0053O89IS|5.0|I have all the seasons of Bones and this is the best so far. I love this show.  David Boreanaz is the best.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I like Family Guy, so I figured a Sth McFarland movie would be great. Even for Seth, I thought it was lame...
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|My wife is a fan of Susan Boyle's singing.  However, she felt this album is not as good as Susan's previous efforts.  Susan tried to emulate or eclipse the singing of artists who made these songs great and she really failed to do so.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great toy for the family. My 13 and 6 year play with it. Should have bought them for all the nieces and nephews too.
0345803493|5.0|Just like all the women, my wife loved it.<br /><br />Though I had an issue with my One Click Ordering address being wrong, and it getting sent to a previous residence.<br />I actually went to the old house and no body would ever answer the door to let me get it from them.<br /><br />But Amazon Customer Service stepped up to the plate and offered me a refund or a re-ship, and because this was for my wifes birthday, I couldn't wait for a re-ship. Took the refund, went to Books A Million and bought a copy 3 times as expensive :-(<br /><br />One Click thing was my fault, not Amazons - great customer service giving me a refund on something that was my fault (even though at the time I was mad and blamed them for not providing a confirmation screen).
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang is the best comedy series on TV now. Dr. Sheldon Cooper played by Jim Parsons carries the show. The other stars in the show each bring their individual personalities into the show and make it a true success like other comedy series of the past (Seinfeld, Friends). Mayim Hoya Bialik who plays Amy Farrah Fowler does a remarkable job as Sheldon Cooper’s friend who is a girl.  The sixth season continues to bring you great episodes week after week. Well worth the watch.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is now in my top 5, I cannot believe that we haven't seen it sooner.<br />Plots great, my kids liked it even. My 5 year old daughter keeps wanting to &#34;Watch Big Mike&#34;.<br />Will definitely be buying the DVD for $4.99 on Amazon.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I gave this book five star because I really liked the way the author went into so much depth. I love the way the author adds in comedy and it really amuses me.<br />I am a huge fan of Rick riordan`s work and have read all of his books except for the Kane chronicles series.<br />I think this is definitely the author`s best work.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I did.
B007TMON8M|4.0|some of the levels seem to be tougher, and different than earlier reviewers.  the online aspect is a bit annoying, although not so intrusive, just annoying that it's online.  the game itself seems to have some challenging levels, and the physics seems a bit interesting.  The combination of extra weight of your structures counteracts the increased strength from additional bracing makes structures at some of the higher levels (at least for me) pretty tricky.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Quite possibly the best 1st album of any artist from the &#34;Idol&#34; franchise. I truly enjoy Mr. Phillips work. I believe that Mr. Phillips will be a force to be reckoned within the music industry for years to come. This is a wonderful work of art... You will not be disappointed.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This is the best movie for your kids and your family! It can teach them alot of stuff about fish and how they live it is the best movie ever
B0070NSPCU|2.0|Book has many misspellings.  It is a little slow but once you get into the story it is okay.  I don't think I will buy the next one.  It seemed unprofessional to have so many errors.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|This is a review of the film as a self-contained work for people who are not Lord of the Rings buffs. If you don't fall into that category, I invite you to stop reading now. Almost 40 years ago I read \\"The Hobbit and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" with middling interest, then bogged down somewhere in the first third of \\"The Two Towers.\\" I realize these books are near-sacred texts for many and apologize for not sharing your enthusiasm. I don't mind if you vote my review unhelpful if it fails to do what I intend, which is review the movie on its own, but please don't vote it unhelpful because I don't bring to bear your level of expertise on the books. (Also, I have not seen any of the LOTR trilogy movies.) I was willing to see \\"The Hobbit\\" because my kid wanted to go and I had become a fan of director Peter Jackson based on \\"Heavenly Creatures.\\"<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman as a young man; Ian Holm as an old man), a Hobbit who likes his quiet, orderly life in The Shire of Middle Earth, is recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to accompany a group of Dwarfs on their quest to recapture their treasure-filled home in the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Along the way to the mountain, guided for much of the journey by Gandalf, the Dwarfs and Bilbo battle various monsters and dark forces and receive help from the Dwarfs' historic enemies the Elves. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a bit slow in the beginning, but about a third of the way through, the pace picks up, draws the viewers into the action and leaves us in awe of the fllm's craftsmanship in creating one spectacular action sequence after another.<br /><br />The costumes, makeup, sets and special effects are wonderful throughout. If you suffer from vertigo, be careful. A number of highly convincing scenes (even in flat-screen; I did not see the 3D) take place in narrow, high places. The acting is decent for the most part, especially veterans Ian McKellan and Ian Holm. Christopher Lee makes a stunning Saruman,the White Wizard whose wisdom Gandalf consults during the journey. The script has its share of bromides and stilted dialogue, especially in the beginning and in the sequences that take place in Rivendell, the home of the Elves, but it does the job of keeping comprehensible and clear a story with a large number of quirky-named characters, groups, places and objects. For example, Orcrist is the name of a sword, an Orc is a monster that attacks mounted on another monster called a Warg, Azog is an Orc war chief, Radagast is a wizard, Thorin is a Dwarf king, Moria is a Dwarf kingdom, etc. You can see where this could get confusing for the uninitiated.<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"The Hobbit\\" entertaining and beautifully made, enough so that I will watch the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Parent note: This film was more violent than I expected. There are some pretty bloody battle sequences. A PG-13 rating is appropriate.
1401235417|5.0|He was thrilled with this gift.  This is a beautiful hardbound comics.  I recommend them for any avid comic reader.
B001HN6922|5.0|Another Pixar instant classic! We bought a separate TV and DVD player so that Cars 1 and Cars 2 could be playing continuously through our house!
B000000OF6|5.0|This is Queen's greatest hits.  Of course if you like rock you will love it.  I discovered some of the lessor know songs and loved them as well.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Husband loved this and I got it cheaper than I would have at the store!  Speedy shipment so I had it in time for Christmas.  Easy process!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|My daughter downloaded this and I do  not do games.<br />I will probably delete it as soon as I can figure out how.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Just what I ordered and how it was described.  Fast shipping and no problems with the movie.  I will definatley purchase more DVD's.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|They won't let me play it.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and my phone.  They enjoy it and when I need them to be quiet, it works great.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|Was exactly as described.  As close to new as you can get.  Easy payment process and shipment was quick.  No complaints.
1449415881|5.0|Finally something to keep my sane at work. It's amazing how many situations in this calendar are exactly like what I experience.
B005JVNTGM|5.0|Just as described!  Looked like it had never been viewed.  Very speedy shipment and tracking was given to keep up with order.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This movie is full of love, desperation and of course ACTION.  You learn to love the characters= flaws and all!
0307887960|5.0|My husband and I found this diet book very clear and concise, and have been losing weight steadily on it, without feeling deprived.
B0051XI9FO|4.0|Glad we ordered these, bought several on web site, thought shipping charges on some were high, but after all we didnt have to drive to store after store looking for these!
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|it was damage on arrival and i wont ever by anymore movies again because of this and i have nothing else to say
B005NJFSZK|5.0|this was great find, super good quality and heavy enough to take a little boy play time! Glad we ordered online. so easy
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Game is simple with simple graphics. Better graphics would make game better.  Game is fun for a few minutes. Best part is at least it was free.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Awesome, we love the soundtrack!  I got this for my wife, and we love it! We listen to it all the time...lol
B00846REIS|5.0|I was a little reluctant to read this just because I didnt think anything could live up to 50 Shades but this was a great read.  I couldnt put it down.  Now I am impatiently awaiting the 3rd installment.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Great book! Rhonda is the best author that I have read in a long time. It really gives you the power.
B000EQ4434|2.0|HD-DVD is a format that was abandoned by Toshiba in 2008 and is now as extinct as Betamax VHS.<br />HD-DVD discs will not work in standard DVD or Blu-Ray machines.<br /><br />.<br />THE BROTHERS GRIMM was directed by Monty Python's animator and contributing writer, Terry Gilliam. Gilliam's small but impressive directing resum&eacute; includes [[ASIN:B00005O3VC MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL]] (UK-1975), [[ASIN:B0000844JJ TIME BANDITS]] (1981), [[ASIN:0783225903 BRAZIL]] (UK-1985), [[ASIN:B0043X1FM2 THE FISHER KING]] (1991) and [[ASIN:0783229526 FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS]] (1998).<br /><br />Visually cluttered and awash with CGI crâp and mud, THE BROTHERS GRIMM challenges credulity at every turn, even as it distorts the 19th Century timeline. Set in 1811, characters hum \\"Brahms Lullabye\\" when not listening to Rossini's \\"La Gazza Ladra.\\" Feh!<br /><br />I shoulda known better than to hope for a semi-biopic about these guys. In an ultra-busy fairy tale about fairy tale creators, Jacob and Wlhelm Grimm are depicted as a pair of traveling ripoff artists. The reality is quite different.<br /><br />They came from a family of nine kids and had an idyllic childhood. Both were academics; together they compiled a German dictionary. The fairy tales the Grimms are renowned for were written as a result of their main interest, the study of linguistics.<br /><br />In 1808, Jacob was named court librarian to the King of Westphalia. Their first volume of legends was compiled two years later; some of these got published in 1812. Eventually the Grimms amassed and published over 200 such fables.<br /><br />These facts wouldn't make for a good movie, though... or would they?<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.9) The Brothers Grimm (UK/Czech/USA-2005) - Matt Damon/Heath Ledger/Monica Bellucci/Jonathan Pryce
B009H442DG|4.0|I love Olivia, so I couldn't resist this one.  Overall, it's good but not great.  But it'll be a servicable addition to all of Olivia's many fans.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really good book. It has suspense and humor. It kept me interested throughout. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the ending could have been written better.
B00186DV1U|5.0|As an Eastwood fan, it was an amazing bonus to get Malkovich as part of this durable, re-watchable film.  Both excell in their diverse roles and the action is well done.  Very good flick!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|Blah movie but that's just me :) I'm not a big Kristen Stewart fan either so that didn't help the movie :)
1419705849|5.0|This was one of a couple of books my son was wanting for Christmas and he was excited to see it under the tree
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very entertaining. Im glad i paid the 3 bucks. Dont play unless you plan to buy, or youll be stuck on a cliff hanger.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|great way to pass the time when waiting for the kids to get out of school or after school practice
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|Sadly I only got through the first 150-200 pages before I lost interest in this book. The focus on grand events and powerful magic left the characters lacking in depth. Several scenes were not played out to their potential, clearly functioning as plot points taking the reader to the next scene, leaving the setting cardboardlike and the people uninteresting. Examples are the surprise meeting with the empress in her throne room and the scene in the death realm. Furthermore, all of the main characters seem to have the same mindset and voice, which gets boring fast.<br /><br />I can see the fun in throwing the reader smack into the action without explaining too much of what's going on at first, but this strategy will only work if the reader can latch on to compelling characters with their own unique voice.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. She loves the series, as well as I do and was thrilled to receive it. Cannot wait for series 3. Love the idea it was the original UK version
0446541478|4.0|This book was truly a great and enjoyable book to read. It focuses on how Israel, a tiny country with its back to the wall for survival, was able to overcome all odds and become a technological and economical powerhouse. The examples given amd the way its told are truly remarkable. However, the reason I gave it four stars was because the middle portion of the book goes into a repetitive lull that I think could have been condensed. The book has a great beginning and a great ending but just has a boring portion in the middle that slows it down a little.<br /><br />Regrdless, I highly recommned this book to anyone looking to be motivated and inspired. You will not be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun, just wush adds werent so often and game didnt ask to pay so often blah blah blah blah blah
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. Large print and keeps up with how I got my figures. Highly recommended for all!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Nothing like pac man .  This is also a good app.  This not only keeps me busy but also the kids enjoy it as well.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|While other families watch the the usual traditional holiday movies we watch this movie over and over throughout December. This movie is so entertaining the jokes are just as funny as the first time we saw it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual his books are hard to stop reading. They keep you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for the next one.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|This was nothing like the original series. It was too stupid not even funny. Even the part where Johnny Depp played a short scene could have been eliminated.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The movie was awesome and the soundtrack is great! It is only selected highlights, so you don't get the whole movie soundtrack, but all the best is on there! I have it in my car and I'm sure the people driving around me are wondering what i'm up to when I am singing along!
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I loved Puss in Boots in the Shrek movies so when this movie came out, I couldn't wait to see it. I loved it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This latest by Vince Flynn did not disappoint. Having worked in the business for many years I have had first-hand experience with some of the personality types that Rapp reacts to so it enhances the believability of the characters for me. Some parts are a stretch but that's why it's fiction and I prefer that to factual/historical novels.
B0088TG252|4.0|Denzel always plays very good parts and this was no exception. I wasn't real happy with the ending though. I
B0086700CM|5.0|My 11 daughter loves this game.  She plays it all of the time.  I think she is attached to it
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|I love movies with a female action hero and Zoe didn't disappoint me. The actor that played her as a child was outstanding!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am not much on fantasy but this group of books kept my attention. This book may have changed my mind on how we really are.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I started watching this series of movies one weekend when they were playing the first three movies back to back so I rented this one and it was great.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Kind of a confusing movie. My husband liked it more than me.  I would have preferred to rent this from the red box instead.
B0071MV540|4.0|This movie was OK. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be and it wasn't as interesting as i thought it would be,
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Once again, my husband liked this movie more than me.  I would have preferred to rent it from the red box for one dollar.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book is a great read but be warned, it is depressing. You don't usually get books with an ending like this one - or at least I do't normally read them.  What it does drive home is the opinions and legality of euthanasia and how everyone is different.<br /><br />It's hard to review this without giving it away - so all I will say is be prepared to be left feeling sad but go along for the ride, it certainly makes you think.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love seeing the things people make from crafts to food to just about everything. I get many great ideas to make things for my grandchildren. Or crafts they can make themselfs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is addicting and fun. It is simple but you can work towards beating your friends by connecting the app with your facebook. My friends and I are always competing. It is fun to see who can get the highest score. You can work towards getting upgrades that help you go a longer distant. The only bad thing is that the app sometimes gets bogged down on the kindle and will glitch every now and then. I still recommend this app to anyone. Even kids should be able to play this app without many problems.
B000000QFV|4.0|Post-Dio Black Sabbath is still very maligned, sometimes for good reasons (Many, many lineup changes, slick 80s production values, a few duds here and there, the entire \\"Forbidden\\" album), but there are good albums from this era. \\"Tyr\\" is one of those gems. It's biggest weakness is the mix. It's very late 80s-early 90s, with way too much reverb, and for some reason the guitars are mixed way in the back, and the drums sometimes drown out the other instruments. Regarding Tony Martin, he's a solid vocalist who does a great job on this one. He lacks Ozzy's personality and Dio's virtuosity, but he is far from the weak point of Sabbath's turbulent decade.<br /><br />Now for the album itself: it's not the doomy, sludgy 70s, and it's not the melodramatic bombast of the Dio albums; \\"Tyr\\" is a Sabbath that is more like Jethro Tull at times, but you never forget who it is when Tony Iommi's guitar is there. \\"Battle of Tyr/Odin's Court/Valhalla\\" is a great triad that carries you through a lot of moods and melodies, and builds perfectly from one piece to the next. It's a fantastic mini-suite. \\"Tyr's\\" other highlights are \\"The Sabbath Stones\\" and \\"Jerusalem.\\" There really isn't a bad song on this album. \\"Tyr\\" has just been ignored because Ozzy and Dio aren't on it, and unfortunately it's gone out of print as a result. If you find it though, scoop it up. It'll grow on you.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I won't go into a long-winded review here because that has already been done.  But I will add to all the previous opinions that this soundtrack is awesome!!  Howard Shore has created another masterpiece.  If you love the movie (or the Lord of the Rings films) and you enjoyed the music...you will love this soundtrack.  It is well worth the price.  If your on the fence...get it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|A little long to get to the resistance part of movie but I liked the remake and the visual chase was very good. Kate was worth it.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Positive: Grammatically, well written and very descriptive on the setting.<br />Negative: This series drug on! I kept waiting for something big to happen and it never did. The characters were bland and not well developed, despite the amount of description for the setting of the plotline. My advice: save your money. The book ends poorly, like the author just gave up writing or something. I'm rating this 2 stars because the grammar is super for a Kindle book-no misspellings or grammatical errors. I can't give it any more than that because the plot was just weak.
067942850X|5.0|This is not exactly a novel, but a sort of a chronicle, a really interesting book about Christopher Johnson McCandless and his trip into the wild, in Alaska. The books covers the two previous years in which Christopher McCandless walked through the USA. A really interesting story about human relationships, living in the wild, humanity... I recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is a fantastic one for teens who are trying to figure out life and find themselves. You can really empathize with the main character, Charlie, and realize a lot of things about yourself. This was a great read and I really do recommend it to young adult readers and anyone who wants to experience the thrills of learning more about yourself and finding out who you really are.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|OH MY GOD!!!!!! The moment I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. When I first saw this book the title didn't really appeal to me until I saw the movie. Then I thought why not give the book a shot?? And now I don't regret it at all!!!!!!! Suzanna Collins you are my new favorite author!! I love your work!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was funny, touching and very well-written. I loved every page of it. I think the author has tremendous talent. Romance usually isn't my cup of tea, but this one rocks!

B00AIQP9DE|2.0|it was a good game and had me interested. I hated that when you get kind of far it cuts off and you have to pay. I don't like games like that. if if wasn't for that then it would have been a great game.

0688170528|2.0|OK nothing to &#34;write home about&#34; very predictable writing and did not much for me. I know this author is very popular but it is too preachy in some ways and one can see the end miles and pages away.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|Arrived intact as advertised. Looks great and works great. Will recommend it to all who might be interested. Good deal!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Suspenseful and creepy and awesome! Always twists and turns that you don't expect. My husband and I could watch the whole season in a day if we could,  I'm sure.
B00000J1YR|5.0|Of course a great album by Dire Straits. Live tracks recorded from 1978 to 1981. On this album we listen to Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits on the beggining of their carrer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing... everything about it, amazing. This book makes you rethink what you are doing with your life, and the people who change it and make it worthwhile.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was chosen as my book clubs January selection.  To say I was dubious, skeptical, and underwhelmed by this choice would be an understatement.  However, I decided to open it and at least I could say I 'tried' to read it.  Wow!  The first thing that struck me was the passion and honesty that translated through the words of Dr. Alexander... then when I saw he had practiced at Brigham & Women's Hospital, in Boston... I quickly contacted a trusted, longtime friend who also worked there at the same time.  I told her what I was  reading and that it sat open on my desk... she used 3 words... \\"I believe him\\".  That's all I needed... because it was exactly what I was thinking, too.  After chatting for a bit, I hung up and turned the page, I finished this book excited to share it with every one!  Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!

B005VPRETE|5.0|First of all, ANY lego set you buy for your kid is going to be great. Teaching them how to follow the building directions is a good thing; putting the directions aside and building your own creation is a good thing for stimulating imagination and creativity.<br /><br />This particular set is a winner. Building the treehouse itself dishes up just the right amount of challenge without it being painstakingly complicated. The little animals and girl it comes with are cute. The touch of \\"girly\\" colors make it fun.<br /><br />We've taken it apart and put it back together several times, and it's still just as fun and cute. And I know that someday when the treehouse has lost it's appeal, the uniquely shaped pieces will make a nice addition to the tub of legos in the closet and will still be fun for building other things.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've loved this game on other devices and it didn't fail me on my Kindle Fire HD.  Now I can play when I want & where I want.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing Mahjong!!  Enjoy ...
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I have never watched any movie more than once except Avengers (twice). I watched this movie 3 times already and I'm deciding whether to watch the 4th time or wait for DVD to come out. I just love how they made the mythical beings from my childhood become awesome butt-kicking superheroes! The characters interaction with each other is also a lot of fun to watch.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I like the movie for its complicated plot and twists and time travel. I am also impressed with Emily Blunt's acting.<br /><br />But I think the movie can do away with the scenario where Gordon does shoot covered Bruce dead and take the gold. This part doesn't make sense. Because if Gordon closes the loop in 2044, then the rainmaker's mom would not die from Bruce and the rainmaker would grow up not being the master criminal who terrorizes the planet, closes all the loops and kills Bruce's wife in 2074.  They would have to tell another scenario about how the Rainmaker had a bad past/path and became the Rainmaker. The story would work if someone else in 2074 also  tries to go back in time to kill the rainmaker and in turn hurts the mom.  This other killer contends with Bruce and Bruce eventually takes him out also and became in direct line to kill the mom instead and forces Gordon to eventually kill himself to save the mom.<br /><br />Sometimes the violence was too much especially, it makes you crinch in light of recent real shootings. Some snippets showing gun availability, drug use, shooting an innocent kid and mass shooting with the rifle, all remind you the worst of  humanity today and possible future.  Too dark on that part.  I wish it had less of that super die hard element. It could have been done still tastefully w/o it.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I've been a follet fan for years, but this is a piece of really bad writing. It's written in a style that might appeal to a young reader, but not any adult mature reader that I know. The dialogue is stilted, immature and not at all like real people would interact. The characters are shallow and not developed as I would expect.<br />Having read just about everything ken follet has written, this is a real disappointment. It's as if he was in a hurry and couldn't be bothered to do an edit. This is a cynical piece of tripe that makes him more money but cheapens his franchise.<br />I am torn. Do I bother to finish reading this or dump it in favour of something with real literary appeal.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Pitch Perfect is like all the Dancing, Cheerleading and Singing movies that have some sort of contest associated with them,,, they are DUMB!!!!
B004U52VPS|3.0|The game is ok but not quite what I expected in the catapult. Flimsy for a 5 year old. Angry birds
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Loved Mad Men Season 5, cannot wait for Season 6 and beyond.  It brings the sixty's and seventy's alive again.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had these exact headphones but I think they folded and sony painted the tip gold so they were a little nicer but from what I remember these sound just the same.  I don't use them every day so I can't comment on the durability of these but like anything if you pull on something too strong it'll break.  It's an electronic not a chew toy for a dog. I didn't even need these but I bought them because the price is so nice.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is a good entretaining movie.  Big fat Amy makes the movie.  I will recommend it.  It rocks. Don't miss it.
B000SZK41M|5.0|This is one of the most action packed, unpredictable movies I have seen in decades.  The more recent movies pale by comparison.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love the game & play it all the time.  It's great that you can go back & try and beat your old record.
1451696205|5.0|My step daughter loves to read, so this was a simple, fun purchase for her...  very happy with everything, only wish I had thought to have it shipped to her house, in Michigan rather than mine in California
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fu game, we have it on my IPhone, my Kindle Fire and my sons tablet my son and Iplay this game all the time.. however it gets very hard the further you go
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I never knew about this movie.Sawt he adult version on amazon and figured what the heck.Anyhow,its a must see movie,not for kids in adult format,The picture quality was horrible despite the fact Ive got plenty o bandwidth
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Love Scarpetta.  This was a great book and had no idea who did it til the end.  Patricia Cornwell is one if my favorite authors.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is Amazing. A def must read for anyone that is looking for a great book to read. It is definitely worth every penny.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|This is a well written dissertation on how the author believes the universe came to be. The concepts are well presented in a layered manner bringing the reader along for a fascinating journey.<br /><br />I consider myself a lay person with a strong interest in physics. I appreciated particularly that at just the right moments the author would briefly remind the reader of a previously discussed important concept.<br /><br />The only detractor was the constant harping on why we do not need a God, and the not in the least bit subtle criticism of those who may choose to believe otherwise. It was difficult to tell if that was not his real message rather than one of presenting science.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the previously mentioned distraction, and another because I felt there may be other possible alternative scenarios which should have rated at least a couple of paragraphs. The body of the work really could have rated 5 stars if the author had not been so focused on the exclusivity of his own opinions.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It is utterly impossible not to fall in love with this book. I love all the characters. It is perfect.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Great, lots of fun!  Definitely a good one to see if you like the Avenger series.  Can't believe the bad guy is Mickey Rourke.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book as a little slow in the first few characters. But then it just takes off and you can't put to down.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The music is perfect (as Bella would say) for the last movie.  I like that it has so many songs I want to memorize the lyrics to so that I can sing along.  And, there are only a couple of songs I'm not interested in,which is rare for me.  I'd recommend it to everyone, not just Twilight fans.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok until u have 2 buy...... but since its free i would get it cuz 4 the first 5 or 10min i had a lot of fun
1400067820|5.0|Very pleased with this order. My husband ordered the book and it was here in three days. Great service .
B009KY0UCK|5.0|This is a true collectors item from this great BOND Movie...Adele sounds great and the song reminds me of the Great BOND Classics of the past...dont miss getting this item!!!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Reading the classics give you a perspective that is not much seen to those of us only exposed to the movies or modern story versions. This book took the story to a new and different level I did not expect.
0375851569|5.0|Came in time just as described on web site.  Do not have any thing else to say about it now.
B009ZE27US|1.0|it is so stupid I dont know why anybody would get it.<br />who's stupid enough to by it anyways. so if you are reading this don't by this game its so stupid.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I bought this cuz Tom Hanks and Steven Spielburg did an excellent job filming Band Of Brothers.  So when I saw them filming The Pacific I just had to get it.  I would recommend this to anyone that is a war fan out there 5 out of 5 good job HBO.
B000P0J09C|5.0|classic movie of young men serving their country. on the way they experience many, many things that will change their lives forever.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|The song by Adele was excellent.  I saw the movie and heard the song so I could not wait to purchase this single<br />recording.  I hope Adele will include it on her new album and I hope it wins an award this year.  I recommend this song and<br />movie to anyone who would be interested.
B0046H95RM|5.0|And Then Were None by Agata Christie - I love it. One of the best book written by A. Christie. Will read again:)
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Wasn't what I thought it would be.  Both actors are some of my favs, but this movie was not.  If you don't want your spouse bugging you, watch it alone.  lol
B0076DELIG|5.0|One of Michael Connelly best.Great story. Fast paced and full of twists and turns.  Hard to put down.  Recommend highly
B00000JBFW|5.0|Many waited for Deep Purple to reunite and when they did they came out with a perfect release. Perfect Strangers is a masterpiece. Every track on this cd is enjoyable. Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore together just bring something special to the band. But it takes the whole band to work for something great to be created. Just think how much fantastic music could have been written by this band if they had found a way to stick together in the 70's to the 80's, oh well at least they gave it another shot and it was just perfect.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was was smart, rivoting and kept me actively engaged from beginning to end! Great perspective and really twisty turny! BUT, THE VERRRY END...was unsatisfactory to say the least. I was disappointed. :(
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The  free adobe reader for kindle fire works well. I just recently downloaded the app on my kindle fire from the kindle app store. I haven't encountered any problems with the app as of yet. Glad to have it.
