0765356147|2.0|After looking forward to this finale to the trilogy for over a year, perhaps my expectations were too high. Suffice it to say I'm disappointed. Aside from the fact that hardly anything happens in the first half, the characters (those that are left) are scattered and thus unable to further their relationships in any meaningful way, and Vin and Elend's marriage has faded into flatness, it was ultimately the ending that just plain didn't work for me. The explosion into over-the-top epicness isn't a bad thing by any means, and I do respect Sanderson's world-building and his ability to tie off all the questions and loose ends so perfectly, but the final solution just left me feeling flat. The book as a whole I would rate three stars. I don't generally get upset over disappointing endings, but perhaps because I loved the first book so much, I can't help but be extra disappointed with this one.
0307951529|5.0|I've been reading Chris' blog for years, and he's one of the most inspiring people I know.  By using several real-world examples and REAL NUMBERS in this book, Chris gives very specific examples of people who have become their own bosses for little money up front.  I encourage everyone who enjoys the book to also read Chris's blog -- no hype, just continual inspiration and encouragement.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have downloaded a few calculator  apps, and this one by far is the easiest!  No frills.....just a big calculator!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if it was an option. This was a good movie; entertaining. Way too violent for my usual tastes, however. Some scenes were just over the top violent. The acting was good. Overall, a good sci-fi movie, definitely reminiscent of Aliens, Predator, etc.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|It's grotesque. It's disgusting. It's disturbing. It's wrong. It's brilliant. Yes, the sickest movie ever made --- 'A Serbian Film', has finally been released in the U.S. completely uncut and uncensored for the first time. And it's not for the novice. Look, I don't care if you've seen 'I Spit on Your Grave' and 'Last House on the Left' a hundred times each. They're Disney films compared to this puppy. This is it. This is as far as you can go in a film. The limits have been stretched to the max. Director Srdan Spasojevic takes you on a ride to hell you won't ever forget even though you might want to.<br /><br />Banned in Norway, Spain, and Australia --- 'A Serbian Film' is, in actuality, a parody of modern politically correct films made in Serbia which are financially supported by foreign funds. Yup, underneath the layer of perverted ultraviolence is a powerful political message. Unfortunately, for some people, the disturbing nature of the movie won't allow them to see it. The story? All I'll say is it revolves around a retired porn actor accepting one last 'job' that turns out to be an utter nightmare.<br /><br />Be warned. Be careful. Believe the hype.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super super super super addicting to play. I play at least once everyday because I can never get enough of it
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It has really realistic graphics (for an app.) and is so addictive that I find myself playing for hours nonstop.I had this game on my ipod touch, ans was super happy when Ifound it here at the amazon appetite.
1439192812|5.0|We have a house full of books, we encourage our kids to read whatever they want. This book went in the pile and my eldest (11) just loved it. A million follow on questions arose, which I think is a success for any kids book.<br /><br />Mr Dawkins, well done, and we would love a follow up.
0345472322|5.0|A really succinct and readable insight into what motivates us. I would recommend it to anyone working in schools as applying these ideas will make your life a lot easier!
B003UYUP58|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is drama on a grand scale, compelling one to read through the night to discover how we<br />fought this terrifying adversary in the past and what we now employ in this enormous battlefield. Beautifully written, but<br />the feeling of unified struggle unravels a bit towards the end.  Magnificent!  Completely absorbing from the first words.
B00846WWVM|3.0|this game is very fun.its difficulty increases every level and its okay but this game is not as addictive as i wished. but very funn. i recomend u to get it.
0312641893|5.0|I opened this book this morning on the recommendation of a co-worker, and I could not put it down.  What a fantastic book!<br /><br />If you love Star Wars and fairy tales, with a hint of dystopian thrown in, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Even though it is technically a teen book I would recommend this item to younger readers that are advanced readers.  It is not overly 'girly' and I can see male readers enjoying this book as well as females.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next installment of the series.
0061450162|5.0|I might have arrived too late to review such a classic. There was a time in my life when Stephen King was THE KING. I am sorry king, it's Gaiman time. Neil Gaiman is not the kind of writer you read one or two of his books, just. He is an artist that should read everything he does. You should even watch his interviews on youtube and add them to your DVD collection. I am not going to review one of the most intriguing plays ever Snow, Glass, Apples, because whatever you thin he has done to the fairy tale, you're wrong. His work is a stroke of genius.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|The two recent Sherlock Holmes movies, featuring Robert Downey as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, offer a complete reinterpretation of the premise.  In contrast to Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, where Holmes is mature and seasoned, in the films he is played as brilliant but wild and erratic.  His relationship with Watson is now an egalitarian friendship: the more stable Watson is the anchor that keeps Holmes sane.  The second film, Game of Shadows, is a considerable improvement over the first.  The plot is ingenious and cleverly written.  The direction is outstanding, with fast pacing and good visuals, which bring the late nineteenth century to life.  There is more action than in the original stories - again, this is a reinterpretation for contemporary audiences.  The climactic scene, in which chess is used as a metaphor for the struggle between Holmes and his arch-nemesis Moriarty, is a nice touch.
0439023521|5.0|when I first bought the book, i thought I will keep rolling my eyes as the book is super stolen from other books. There are few plots in the world, when  a Japanese guy comes with a plot of children killing each other on life tv, you can't convince me that this was your idea too.<br />Anyhow, that said, the Hunger Games is still a masterpiece of its own that I really recommend. I really wished if only a thank you note was given to the writer of Battle Royal and Stephen kind.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! all I do is try and beat every level I would loveeeeee to have this game all to myself
B007Q476KU|3.0|This movie is about the war, and a horse... but the only pivotal moment is amid the war when it brings people together to help the horse.  Other than that, the movie is anti climactic because so little is spoken.  Pretty horse, great scenes... but not oscar worthy to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok so I love this game and have been waitiing for like ever to get it and even begetter it was freeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!&lt;3 lol
B0000DG00B|5.0|I was totally blown away by the clear sound quality of the recordings of those two nights! I have said to many of my friends this recording has some of the best live preformances the Allman Brothers ever produced to date, in my opinion of course.<br />There is a very well written history booklet of that weekend, that also revealed how Duane almost did not make it to the opening of the show.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is soooo kool just like Mario bros.... so fun... luv it :o) its so addicting even my neice n nephew luv this game I just downloaded it n its so kook Id recommend this game 2 every1
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lep's world is great if you're bored. It reminds me of Super Mario Bros.  Being an older person I loved Mario as a child so I'm sure I will love Lep!!! Plus it was free so that's even better!!!  Get it!!
B000SX8BXC|5.0|Norah Jones did it again with this beautiful album.  I couldn't wait for this one to come out and bought the CD as soon it was available.<br /><br />Every melody is wonderful yet again.  The album starts with \\"Sunrise,\\" probably my favorite song of all.  It makes me think of making pancakes on a Sunday Morning.  Then \\"What Am I To You?\\" keeps the music flowing.  Each song has its own sound but they still clearly belong together, linked by the beautiful voice of Norah Jones.<br /><br />Get it now!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! it sooooooooo awesome! :o)  I am so glad kindle fire finally put temple run on!! this g ame is so addicting and you should download it right now.... I mean it download it right now... go do it!!!
0439023513|4.0|If you finished reading Hunger Games or Catching Fire with a sense of hope, Mockingjay will slap that right out of your head.  Mockingjay is a dark, fantastical journey into the worst recesses of the human mind, the evil that lies within absolute power, and the lengths that people will go to break free.<br /><br />I complained about Collins' writing style in her first two books, so I won't dwell on it here.  I still don't love the way she writes but I pushed through because her content is so intensely compelling.  Katniss thinks she's leading the show (as always) but she's quickly put in her place by larger forces at work.  I feel so deeply for Peeta in this book, who is so brainwashed that he can't think straight.  And Finnick is a wonderful secondary character.<br /><br />There was no way to finish this series with kittens and butterflies.  It wouldn't have been right.  It was depressing at times but I was pleased with the way things ended.  Excellent ending for one of the best series I've read in a while.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game but I hate it when it lags so that's why I give only three stars! !
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out and I love it as much (or more) today as I did when I got it.<br /><br />Norah Jones has a haunting voice and every note is sung with passion and love.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" are certainly my favorite songs on the album.  I can listen to them over and over again.  There isn't a single song that I don't like.  You can push play, let the music float over you, and drift away from the real world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.  Norah Jones is a goddess!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game was really fun when I started, but after a while the games get really boring so boring that I haven't even finished all the levels.  Plus there are a lot of adds.  It's fun though if you're looking for a new pass time.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it,  thanks. for bringing this to the fire finally.  cant put it down,  great way to pass the time.
B0069UV0LS|1.0|The best you can do is kill the dog in the first 2 minutes?  That's how you establish the conflicted nature of the protagonist?  Do people really still fall for this cheap shortcut?<br />Don't waste your time on this POS.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and addictive. Great time waster. No lag and very smooth animations. Definitely worth the free download. Can take awhile to get the credits you need to upgrade.
B000VSYDRM|3.0|Silence of the Lambs with notes of Clockwork Orange and a twist of Oliver.<br />A very different movie. You sort of feel like you need wash your mind with soap and water after watching it.<br />Preferably a good smelling soap...
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|I really liked this film, but the plot and writing were a little lacking and overly sentimental. This is definitely worth a look and an enjoyable viewing experience.
0345803485|5.0|This is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. Very captivating and thought provoking. Great love story with several twists and turns along the way. The author makes you feel the emotions that the characters feel. The more you read, the more you want to read. I could not put down this book and each book after was more compelling than the book before it.
0345522478|5.0|Read this in almost one sitting.  Funny and intriguing.  Love how the author mixed pop culture with Druidism.  Highly recommend.
B003EYVXVY|5.0|I did not see this at the theaters, so have nothing to compare it with. I was able to get a hold of a region free copy from Europe. The 3D was stunning. The halographic control panels actually looked like halograms in front of my TV screen. The scenes in the forests of Pandora are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on TV. My only criticizm is that toward the end I had to keep taking my glasses off to wipe my eyes. This is a great movie, with great 3D, great scenery, a great plot, and 5 stars the whole way through.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Has the potential to be a great game.  Just need to fix the bugs.  Getting out of the game isn't impossible but shouldn't be so complicated.  Unable to play with friends.  Also it will not download the update it requires.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a cute game to play when you have nothing else to do.  It keeps you guessing.  Cute little families.  Has some problems with the game but you can work them out
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Realistic action movie with scenes that actually could happen.  Good acting by vetted movie actors that are excellent in the action and above-the-law genre.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and I never get bored of it. I think everyone should get it.its very entertaining and amusing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've never written a book review before, and I don't like to be too critical because I appreciate all the hard work that goes into writing a book, but when I received an e-mail from Amazon asking if I would like to write a review on my recent purchase, I thought if I could prevent one person from wasting their time and money on this book, it would be worth my while.<br /><br />I don't understand why this book is such a big seller.  It is one of, if not THE, worst book I've ever read.  If you are reading the reviews, please believe all the negative ones.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this book for my Kindle so I wouldn't have wasted my time and money. I was curious because of all the hype, but what a disappointment!  The plot is so flat, the characters are not interesting or engaging, and the sex scenes are not even hot.  I've read simple kissing scenes by other authors that are steamier than the scenes in this book.  This book could possibly have potential if it was written better.  It doesn't flow well and the author keeps using the same expressions over and over again. She keeps telling us that Christian is so hot and \\"beautiful\\", but I couldn't buy into it.  His character was a dud.  And I don't understand why he was so attracted to Anastasia.  She was so dippy, and I don't get why she kept wearing her friend's clothes.  Why didn't she have any of her own dresses to wear?  Not a big deal, I'm just sayin'.........<br /><br />There are so many books in this genre that are so much better, I just don't get how this one got so much publicity.  I guess it was just marketed better than other books in this genre, which is a shame, because there are so many other authors out there that have written this type of story so much better.  Please believe these reviews and don't give another penny to this publisher and author.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a fun little app. It's not too time consuming and can be a nice distraction while you're waiting to do something else.
B006RED4GA|1.0|this movie just sucked i want my hour and a half back no plot or resolution so dissapointing will not bw recommending this to anyone
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game its really good esp for kids too. Great graphics easy missions and do not have to use real money.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|Hard to select the boxes on my deroid incredible 2. Could really use the ability to zoom in to make it easier to use on a touch screen interface.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was awesome. To the Author Eric Blehm you did a wonderful job of telling us about Adam Brown. I truly felt and feel I knew him.<br />To Adam's wife, children, mom and dad, and is brother and sister. My heart goes out to you for your lose. I have a son that is in the Navy. He is a Chief I will always remember the day he because a Chief. I was so proud of him. I know all of you had that same day with Adam the day he became a Navy Seal.<br />If anyone wants to know what it is like to be a Seal this is the book to read. I could not put it down. I laughed when Adam was funny. I cried when I got to the end of this book.<br />I respect him and his fellow team of Seals. I also thank each and every member of the Military that help to keep us safe.<br />Freedom is not Free.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|I liked this movie a lot and here is why:<br /><br />The fight scenes were awesome and believable.  There was no frame chopping or camera shaking.  The Bourne movies have awful fight scenes for this reason.  The scenes in this movie were just done with skill.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie was not dumbed down, you have to watch and pay attention to know what is going on.<br /><br />My guess is the people who did not like this were looking for over-the-top, unrealistic action similar to the matrix or bourne movies.....or they were just looking for an action movie that required no thinking.<br /><br />Give it a chance with the right expectations and I think you will like it.  Very underrated.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second story in this trilogy is every bit as good as the first one was.  I could not put them down but didn't want them to end.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is up there with Gone With The Wind. Loved the character development. Would make a great movie.  Need a sequel though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting but a great story line.  Shocking but it was an easy read and I couldn't put it down.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a fun mystery and gave you lots to think about in terms of human experience and memory. However, inconsistencies in plot development and character development plagued the book a bit. Not bad for a first novel.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this book after my boss recommended it too me. She was telling me she was laughing out loud the whole time she was reading the book... Maybe we have a different sense of humor.  It was indeed funny but never caught myself laughing out loud. I also hated the footnotes because they are hard to manage on certain kindle apps.... I click on it... I read the footnote, but then I just lost where I was reading.  So that annoyed me.  I just stopped reading them... they didnt seem very important anyway.  A lot of names were mentioned that I had no clue who they are so it's confusing sometimes.<br /><br />I the good side, Tina Fey is indeed funny and some of the stories are very entertaining to read.<br /><br />All in all, the book was still very enjoyable to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited when I saw this I was waiting like forever for this game to come I cant beloved people are rating this game one star I love this game and its perfect no glitches
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is the best! Could do without the lag. I keep dying too early cause of lag. Otherwise, it's super addicting.
B005LFS3ZS|5.0|Best album ever! Ben Howard is a genius. Everything about this record is s so good. Everything from the melodies to the words, it's so easy to listen to and the amount of talent is amazing. Buy this and share it with all your friends. This guy deserves as much recognition as possible.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The detailed pleasures of the brilliant books are always available to readers willing to tear into them; however their excitement is not lost in this visually stunning and sexy re-telling of this epic story.  A must see and own for anyone interested in post modern fantasy genre.  I am looking forward to Season 2 with bated breath!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like playing this game. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an addicting game. I, as well as my friends enjoy this game. Hope you do too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The graphics are clear and cards are easy to see. The game is easy to understand, but challenging enough to take several minutes to complete a game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I don't know what I would do without it. Everyone should at least try it. You with love this game. It is great for both kids and adults. Please try it !!!!!!!!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|What a disappointment-Phantom had some of the most beautiful songs-music and lyrics both-this sequel has neither. No wonder it bombed in London.

B001HBYHFA|5.0|A must have collection of a wonderful series, cut short after only one season. Great scifi, against a clever backdrop of mid 20th century American TV westerns
B004SDEP38|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I use it on my Motorola Droid 2 and Toshiba Thrive tablet. The one thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating is the number of updates. Every day Amazon tells me there is an update. I don't know if it's a DataViz or an Amazon glitch but it's really annoying to have to update so often for no noticeable changes.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Prometheus was a titan who stole fire from the Gods, gave it to the humans and prevented Zeus from obliterating the human race. In punishment God chained him to a rock and bade an eagle perpetually eat his liver.<br /><br />In Ridley Scott's new film we open with sweeping aerial shots over a steaming, blasted landscape that may be Icelandic and may be Martian. We alight on a waxen figure of titanic Grecian aspect, standing astride a great waterfall, who may be Prometheus himself, \\"chained\\" to his \\"rock\\". Overhead, a higher power is concluding a visit. It does not appear to have been a cordial one.<br /><br />I do not know this for sure, and Scott does not explain further. That mysteries are more potent unexploded is a significant theme of this motion picture.<br /><br />We are pitched forward 35 millennia, to 2093, and into the face of Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an anthropologist out in the field, clawing at an aperture into a concealed cavern with cavalier disregard for that theme. Dr Shaw and her partner Dr Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered cave paintings suggestive of the intervention of an advanced civilisation. This is, of course, the stuff of Erich von D&auml;niken, fashionable as long ago as the 1970s but long since discredited. Nonetheless, Shaw and Holloway propose a multi-billion dollar, ten year expedition to a remote star system to further investigate. Elderly philanthropist Weyland (a rubber-suited Guy Pierce) green-lights the proposal.<br /><br />It must have been one hell of a business pitch.<br /><br />We jump forward a further four years and 50 billion light years (the laws of physics being due an overhaul between now and 2090) to the spaceship Prometheus, which has arrived at that star system. Without ado the ship fetches up on a blasted, steaming landscape, adjacent to a quite [[ASIN:0425166805 von D&auml;nikenesque]] archaeological complex.<br /><br />House android David (an excellently Hal-like Michael Fassbinder) and ship commander Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) are busily waking up their scientists and nursing hidden agendas. It quickly becomes clear that the crew of scientists, shaken from their stupor, have their own agendas too. Thus do we conform to the deep space adventure playbook established by the likes of [[ASIN:B000HEBCZQ 2001: A Space Odyssey]] and, well, Alien. Yet note a dissonance here: just as the dialogue starts in earnest, Scott shifts our gaze from the reverend contemplation of the immortal to the petty melodramas of some new characters with whom we cannot, yet, empathise. Naturally there are figurative parallels but, all the same, this shift in perspective risks rendering the cosmic mundane.<br /><br />I mention this because but for the wonderful production design and those grand metaphysical thoughts there is really nothing really new about the first hour of Prometheus. It is to Alien what [[ASIN:B000HF4U04 2010: The Year We Make Contact]] was to 2001. In place of ineffable profundity there is talky exposition.<br /><br />Ridley Scott renders the cosmic mundane in another way too: We are treated again to HR Giger's stunning necro-organic architecture, rendered briefly in Alien and largely unexplained in the form of a ghastly skeleton with a blown out rib-cage. But this time Scott indulges in exposition: he begins to fill in the details of this race of &Uuml;bermensch, ascribing them motives and agendas. We even meet one. It was better not knowing.<br /><br />In Alien the titillating ambiguity of their remnants left the job of world construction to the viewer. In Prometheus Scott takes away the viewer's autonomy, [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]] dictates a back story, and opens himself wide to plot illogicalities and non-sequiturs. Disappointingly the Engineers' motivations are base, predictable, and not worthy of the phallic grandeur of Giger's production design.<br /><br />By half time in this two hour picture the studied monkishness of its opening has entirely given way to melodramatic space opera, rendered in haphazardly-directed action set pieces. As convention dictates, the dysfunctional crew must be picked off, but this is accompanied by none of the grimness of Scott's original, because the characters are only caricatures of the real men and women we met aboard the Nostromo.<br /><br />There are, generally, too many of them, and they spend too much of the picture gabbing at each other in the meter of stock Hollywood dialogue, depriving the screenplay of the air it needs to work up a genuine chill or to properly frame its grand eternal cogitations.  There are about three false summits before the final denouement, which falls on an offbeat not quite accented enough to justify its build up.<br /><br />This makes me sound too negative: I enjoyed Prometheus a great deal, but hoped to enjoy it immensely more still. It is a beautiful picture to look at, and many of the action set pieces are well executed (Noomi Rapace has her own John Hurt moment, self-inflicted, and it is in equal parts horrifying and (deliberately) hilarious.<br /><br />Ridley Scott has famously railed against studio demands to tinker with the final edits of his pictures. Here, I suspect he had full autonomy. I left the cinema wondering what might have been had someone been more assiduous in that regard: this is a good movie which could have been made great had there been a director more prepared to cut.<br /><br />Olly Buxtony to melodramatic space opera, rendered in haphazardly-directed action set pieces.

1419702203|2.0|For such a large and thick book, the content is very disappointing. The text is just short quotes from George and/or people who knew him. The photos, just one per page, are not especially interesting or revealing. Pictures of scraps of juvenilia drawings, old photos of war-bombed Liverpool, etc etc. Most of the Beatle years are glossed over with just a few pix from films. I was able to flip through and read this whole thing in about 30 minutes or less. The film that it was produced in conjunction with is much more worthwhile. I wish they had taken more time to create some much deeper content for this coffee table volume.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|Apparently right in front of your face. its one thing that every game free or not has some sort of money vacuum attached to it. But to just produce crap like this is just a shame. And from Gameloft. Foreshame, foreshame. Where's Waldo was a classic too bad greed put it ruins, atleast for my Kfire.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This is not a happy film, and there is no Hollywood-esque upbeat ending. As such, this family tale is not likely to be a big hit. Clooney's intelligence in his choice of films is obvious, and this one is a cut above most Hollywood fare. It's a film about dysfunctional people. The mom spends the entire thing in a coma, looking more and more corpse-like. Great acting there! The kids are better than usual. Actually, the best thing here is the soundtrack of genuine Hawaiian music. I'm going to look into getting it. It is great.

B000FCKBCU|4.0|This a sweet fun romantic comedy that reminds us what we really want from life. Hint, it's not always what we have always desired. Sophis Kinsella is a gift to the over worked over stimulated working women trying to find her way in the urban fight to be on top. I love her audio books the narrator does a fabulous job and it is easy to lose myself in her world. A treat.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|On first glance you'll think that this is just a nasty, over-sexed fictional book, but as you read further it's really a deeper insight into how a man deals with childhood abuse.  I was fascinated and have bought the next two books in the trilogy to hear \\"the rest of the story\\"!

B00846REIS|5.0|I've read some reviews that say this book is very similar to Fifty Shades of Gray. I loved 50, and in the reviews of another book, this one was recommended, so I picked it up. I have to admit I'm only about halfway through this, but I'm so impressed, I had to leave a review.<br /><br />First off, the similarities to 50 Shades are startling. Gideon even has a brother with red hair and gray eyes by the name of Christopher. Even this cover is scarily similar to the 50 cover. And now I read that there's a second book and it's got a very similar title to the second book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy? I'm really not certain how they managed to get away with it.<br /><br />That being said, as much I loved Christian in 50 Shades, I love Gideon more. This book is, frankly, better written. The writing itself is very well done. It's intensely emotional (my absolute favorite), and very sexy. Yes, it's erotic, but tastefully done, and it's frankly smokin' hot. The author does very well to put the reader right there, experiencing everything with the characters. I find this a rare treat.<br /><br />At first, yes, Gideon was the arrogant alpha jerk, as I call them, but Eva is his perfect match. She matches wits with him. To watch her put him in his place in the beginning was so much fun. I was cheering her on. The characters are very real. They both have painful histories, and insecurities, and Gideon screws up, he hurts her, but it's very clear it's not intentional, that this is all new to him too. And it's very endearing to watch him. He's an alpha who's out of his realm, because he's so gaga over her. *swoon*. Seriously. I'm in love.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down, and was glad to have all three of them. Finished this whole book in a week, and will reread it again.
B00846REIS|5.0|Since finishing Fifty Shades Freed in March, I was on the hunt for the next book that would satisfy my need for a thrilling and overtly sensual read. Well, I am happy to report to you that THIS.IS.IT. Sylvia Day's Bared to You was extremely well-written, passionate, engaging, and kept me up till the very early morning hours.<br /><br />For Fifty Shades of Grey fans, Bared to You is definitely one book you must read. Eva and Gideon's story does bare similarities to Christian and Ana but the setting and incredible well rounded and equally damaged secondary characters gives this story an edge. I liked that fact that Eva wasn't scared to be in bed with Gideon. No fears of flogging, whipping or caning.<br /><br />With Fifty Shades, Ana always had that lingering fear of Christian physically hurting her. With Gideon and Eva, it is was all about fulfilling their intense sexual desires. These two simply sizzled together. This book was more than a 5 Star read.
B004J4X73K|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series and this author and her newest addition does not disappoint!  I really liked that Alec and Seregil were back in Rhiminee as Nightrunners again, and I enjoyed the character development for mage Thero.  I hope we will see these characters back again soon!
B007RAJVR4|3.0|I like the songs, however, it feels like they're overly produced, smoothed, for lack of better explanation. The best tracks by far are the live cuts.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just finished the last 25% of this book yesterday and I have not stopped thinking about it.  In fact, I woke up in the middle of the night, wondering, like I did when I first read the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, if this could really happen.  Just as I had wondered if anyone really received letters to Hogwarts, I so wondered if maybe we were in the middle of one of Al or George/Jake's \\"time-resets,\\" and our lives could be totally different.    This book was an incredible undertaking, and part of the reason I enjoyed it so much is because I'm NOT a history buff, and born in 1980, I was not alive during Kennedy's assassination.  King's protagonist, George/Jake, also doesn't know a lot about history.  He's an English teacher (like me).  Stephen King makes the historical accounts of Oswald and Kennedy and Texas palatable and easy to read.  He brought the late 50's and early 60's to life and made me almost jealous that I couldn't be there!    My favorite FAVORITE part of the book was the love story, which was totally unexpected.  I loved Jodie, Texas and George/Jake's life there.  I am still totally haunted by the devastating and messed up future of King's imagination.  The ending was bittersweet, and I was surprised to see that it was NOT the original ending.  You can find the original ending here:    [...]    I am thankful to King's son for having his father rewrite it.  Overall, I give this book five stars, and recommend futures readers to not be daunted by the length, but rather to enjoy every bit of it.  I'm sad it's over.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I think everyone who read Hunger Games had been looking forward to the movie.  I counted down the days until it finally came out.<br /><br />  Generally, I find it hard to see a movie based on a book that I love.  I find that I'm never satisfied and I can't help but compare the two.  I really didn't want to do  that when viewing Hunger Games, though of course I did.  But gratefully I can say, I think they did an excellent job.  The movie followed the plot of the book almost to a T.  Yes, of course there were missing elements and a few added surprises, but what were we expecting?  Perfection?  I was really shocked at how well they did.<br /><br />I have high hopes for Catching Fire considering how well they did on Hunger Games.

B00870ZH3U|5.0|I always say that I am going to start reviewing items on Amazon more often... So here goes!<br /><br />Allow me to preface by saying that I generally cannot tolerate the stage production of musicals, nor theater!  Oh and I have given them so many attempts to earn my appreciation.  They usually irritate me more than entertain me.  I will note that I do enjoy Opera and most of the productions I have seen.<br /><br />My first introduction to the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" was the CD after hearing a version of \\"Music of the Night\\" when I was 18 in 1992 and loving it.... I have seen the stage production several times, the traveling group when in Dallas, and usually left disappointed because I always thought that Christine's performance and reactions were a contradiction to the music and lyrics. I never liked Christine.  Not even Sarah Brightman when I saw the performance on TV.  Also, I did not see the charisma and suaveness that the Phantom possessed in the book.  I always listened to my CD and imagined the two, Christine and the Phantom, performances based just on that composition...  Isolating the music and lyrics from the visual...  Only the 2004 movie did come the closest to what my imagination always produced...  but that is another review, altogether.  This is for \\"Love Never Dies\\"!<br /><br />\\"Love Never Dies\\"..... WOW!  What can I say about it?<br /><br />Ben Lewis.... I believe he nailed the Phantom!  That suave charisma that the Phantom was known for, with the underlying insecurities and madness.... He was excellent!<br /><br />Anne O'Byrne.... Awesome Christine!  You can see the internal conflict regarding her love for the Phantom.... And in the book, Christine did love the Phantom.  Leroux wrote it as a serial gothic mystery and tragic romance.  Although, it sold poorly and not really that great of a book, only one of the most amazing characters!<br /><br />The production value of LND?  Well, it entertained me more than it irritated me!  I cannot wait to see this one day on the stage.  I would love to be in the first few rows during \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" and \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\"...  The visual aspects of the filming of this stage production are beautiful!<br /><br />Fleck, Gangle and Squelch?  I wanted to see more of them!!!!!  They were so entertaining....<br /><br />The storyline?  I thought it was good.  I have known of the book on which it is somewhat based, \\"The Phantom in Manhattan\\", and never really had an interest in reading it.  I do believe that Meg is not the antagonist in the novel... BUT, I always thought that Webber always portrayed Madame Giry as obsessive... and a little CRAZY!!!  So, I can see the parallel in her passing that obsession onto Meg.<br />I still gave this 5 stars because I think everyone who is a Phantom fan should give this a chance... But really it is 4 ½ stars... Wished Webber would have stuck to the timeline.  I mean... he had an active role in the 2004 movie... AND I think he used that as his vehicle to re-characterize the Phantom and Christine, especially their relationship.... So why did he not utilize it?  You know he has had LND in mind for a decade, at least!<br /><br />It does give those of us who always wanted Christine to acknowledge her love for the Phantom some closure... haha!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|What the hell could I say to give Jamie the justice she rightly deserves. I was told about this book a by a good friend who said she needed someone to talk about it with so I bought it of course because I take upon a good recommendation where I can get it since there are plenty of duds out there. Well Beautiful Disaster is not a dud, it is a one of a kind! I started it when I got home from a 40th birthday party last night at about 11pm and began to read it. By 2:30am I thought, Holy hell I better get some sleep so I went to bed only to get up again after half an hour and read some more for another two hours. At that point I really could have kept going but being a wife an mother I knew i had to get some sleep so I grabbed a few hours before I was back into it again.<br />I lost sleep and some of my Sunday and I don't regret it one bit as I enjoyed being swept up in the love story of Travis and Pige (Abby)<br />I could relate as a teenager of 16 when I met my now husband who was a few years older then me and scared the crap out of everyone because of his tats and protective nature, but I knew him to be a nice marshmallow. Like Abby and Trav, we started off with the fact I didn't fall to his feet like the other girls and he knew right then (so he tells me) that I was the one. He stopped his girl entourage and we became friends in hopes I would realize he was not the man everyone believed him to be but what I wanted and needed.<br />People snickered over his change and my naivety but we were so intense it scared some people.<br />I am telling you this because I have heard people say that this kind of relationship is BS and wont last, we have 2 children and have the happy ever after story 16 years later and even if we didn't it was still a great work of fiction that had me on edge for their relationship survival the whole way through. Well Done!<br />I loved this story and can not wait to read others Jamie has written and if the rumor of Beautiful Disaster being written in Trav's POV is true then I am in.<br /><br />Thank you Jamie for a loving, entertaining, whirlwind of a romance.<br />Kezin Trav's POV is true then I am in.<br /><br />Thank you Jamie for a loving, entertaining, whirlwind of a romance.<br />Kez

B00005JKN9|2.0|There were so many basic errors in the historical facts, clothing, weapons, gangs themselves, the army, etc, that I could not enjoy it, the way one can with Braveheart or other good movies where the director doesn't let facts get in the way of the truth.  Most of the gangs of NY were Irish Catholic and fought among themselves in support of candidates, but deaths were rare.  Whole blocks were NOT the scenes of pitched battles with axes and guns and every woman wasn't a prostitute.  Its wasn't Irish Catholic vs Protestant.  The scenes of the army and navy in 1863 were not even close.  Scorsesee completely ignored those facts.  One thing he did get right was the attitude of the rich and some of the machine politicians of NY, and the basic attitudes of the poor Irish vs the draft and anything they believed made the draft necessary (like freeing the slaves and further competition for jobs).  There was no great pitched battle between \\"Americans\\" and \\"Irish\\" interupted by cannon shells and murderous soliders as depicted in the film.  The draft riots were simply police and the army vs the rioters who went on a rampage against the draft, killing negroes, police and setting fire to anything they perceived as supporting it (including a negro orphanage).  Anyone watching that movie came away with the opinion that the whole area was shelled by navy ships and shot and stabbed by soldiers as hundreds died in an hour or two, with a hundred more killed by the rival gangs. In reality, most of the deaths were poor blacks caught and killed as scapegoats.  The death toll was probably around 120, 80% of them black.  Five Points wasn't even part of the riots - that was centered on the areas where the draft machinery and establishment lived.<br /><br />Its too bad Scorsese could not figure out a way to tell the fantastic story correctly, make us smarter and entertain.  Nice costumes though...a few were even accurate.<br /><br />but the saddest thing is he did not pay homage to the spirit of the immigrant population themselves, as if all were out of work thugs or prostitutes.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.f the immigrant population themselves, as if all were out of work thugs or prostitutes.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.

1469984202|5.0|I just bought the omnibus set (Wool volumes 1-5) last week, and - having a day job - have spent every night reading into the wee hours, having to force myself to set it down for a few hours sleep before work.  Don't bother just buying one book at a time - i promise youll want the whole series, so just buy the omnibus!  (And as soon as I finished that, I jumped back on Amazon and bought Volume 6!)<br /><br />The story picks up steam as the books fly by, and the writing is surprisingly excellent, allowing you to get to know and care about characters without any feeling of over-writing or pretentiousness.  With good writing, the reader has vivid scenes unfold without being reminded he's reading, and that's the case here.<br /><br /> I have no doubt that Hugh Howie will be more and more successful as awareness of his talent spreads, and am SO glad that we are in an age of  e-books so his work can get recognition simply because it is so good (rather than risk never being discovered because a big publisher didn't happen to notice)!  All the people now reading his work are FORCING them to take notice!  :-)

0062119044|2.0|The story is told in what, accurately or not, I think most people imagine is the internal dialog of an intellectual woman living in New York City. Relentlessly self-examining but barren of any real change, tiresomely laden with rich vocabulary and the pensive tone of a person who is obsessively watching their own emotions from a literary distance, the voice of the protagonist - the mother of a teenage boy who has slaughtered everyone he doesn't like at his school - is difficult to like and to listen to for the whole book.<br /><br />The story seems like a depressing and horrible cautionary tale for women who aren't sure they want children - her reason for having her child has nothing to do with love for her husband and is openly, transparently, the selfish result of a kind of pernicious boredom.  Again, as I imagine people in New York to be, her implicit feelings of superiority over most other people and contemptuous disdain for religion, become wearing. It was also tiring and discouraging to read how consistently her husband denies the child's hostility, malice and hatred, and gradually discards his wife in order to protect his illusions about his son. The fact that the style of writing seems realistic makes this dissolution of a marriage seem realistic, too, as if the slow, painful emotional separation from a once-loving husband is as much a predictable outcome of a not-really-wanted pregnancy as is a son who premeditates and successfully carries out a mass murder.<br /><br />The internal monologue that shapes itself through the medium of letters also sometimes delivers commentary on our culture - we are characterized as lifeless watchers who \\"need\\" mass murderers to commit acts that can be endlessly watched on the news, in books, and in sensational dramatized movies.  While the commentary is not without value, it's such a narrow and grim view that it almost has the effect of creating or hardening a cynical, bitter view of humanity in general. After reading the book, if readers are not conscious of adopting these ideas as they are reading, they may find this dehumanizing outlook difficult to shake off.<br /><br />The letters to her husband are odd in that they don't seem to be addressing a person who will or does respond, so the surprise ending didn't surprise me very much at all.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found the book to be depressing and an ugly glimpse into a mind that, while being full of words and concepts, is spiritually empty. Because the antagonist, her son, and the story are so ugly also, I can not recommend this book.

The album is dominated by grand ballads which in addition to \\"The Wild Ones\\" count songs like \\"Still Life\\", \\"The Asphalt World\\", \\"Blask or Blue\\", \\"2 of Us\\" and \\"The Power\\" - especially the former two are highlights on a generally very complete and consistent album.<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains besides various demos and live recordings a string of contemporary singles releases which include the catchy \\"My Dark Star\\" and the beautiful moving \\"The Living Dead\\".<br /><br />Especially the acoustic \\"The Living Dead\\" is a personal favorite.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|About 8 moths ago I began receiving Entertainment Weekly in the mail for absolutely no reason.  It was free so I figured, \\"Why not?\\"  I would kind of flip through the pages, haphazardly reading a line here, a review there.  Then came the issue with some information about Prometheus which I was very interested in reading.  I ended up reading the whole magazine that time and at some point someone mentioned something about the Wool Series being made into a movie.  I love books that come in a series so it piqued my interest.  I thought that this book must have been around for some time for them to be considering making it into a movie.  To Amazon I went and lo and behold, there was a 6 book series (a 7th in the making!!!  Can't wait!) that sounded like it was right up my alley.  Love post apoc stuff.  So I downloaded this Omnibus edition and realized the book had really not been around that long.<br /><br />This book was amazing.  I could not put it down.  The story line unfolds relentlessly.  The characters are so well developed, even if it is very briefly in some cases, that I actually got emotional about Juliette and I wanted to shout for joy when Barnard reaped his reward.  I immediately bought the 6th book and I have just bought Half Way Home.  Hugh, you're becoming a staple on my (electronic) book shelf.  You kind of remind me of Kurt Vonnegut with some Phillip K. Dick mixed in but altogether lighter. I will read as much as you have to say.  Keep 'em coming. :)

0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is a cleverly written, astonishingly touching, yet witty novel. Green's story features the life of several characters and how it is affected by Cancer. When writing about such an emotive subject as Cancer in teenagers it would be easy to fill a book with stereotypes and clichés. However, Green's work is much more than a book about Cancer.<br /> Green's novel is from 16 year old Hazel Grace Lancaster's point of view, a girl who has terminal lung cancer. She has an oxygen tank attached to her nose because in Hazels' words \\"My lungs suck at being lungs\\". Her life changes dramatically when she attends a Cancer support group and encounters Augustus Waters. As these two grow closer, their witty and thought-provoking conversations serve to lighten the mood of a novel surrounding a rather serious topic. They ask the questions that relate to the reader: Will I be loved? Will I be remembered? Will I leave a mark?<br /> The author's writing style has the ability to handle the pace of the novel appropriately and create characters with a voice that will touch the reader. Furthermore, Green makes The Fault In Our Stars an enjoyable read as he bases Hazel's journey not on the acceptance of death but on the acceptance of life. How life is not always fair, but life just is. The Fault In Our Stars is not a depressing read and it is not an uplifting novel either. It is simply a truthful depiction of love, loss, and the life of a young girl who has cancer.<br /> The Fault In Our Stars is an insightful and moving novel that will leave the reader with a lump in the throat, but with a more optimistic understanding of life.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|Going into SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO I knew there was no way they would have the time to compact such a dense and detailed mythology into one movie - as to why it was limited to one film and not a trilogy?, I have no idea.  Given the popularity of the series not only in its home country, but around the world, it would seem like a smart idea to keep people hooked for three films instead of packing it into one; but this one was under the wave motion gun from the start to try and cobble together enough of a plot of justify making the film.  I wish I could say that they managed to do it, but, as it stands, this version of the YAMATO is whole different version all together.  The choices made to compact the story line are baffling and the changes made are confusing - you do see the ghost of the original, but only in the corners, along the margins and tucked into the shadows.<br /><br />The film suffers from not being able to get over itself.  This is one emotional boat full of people who seem more interested in their personal honor and minor problems than looking at the whole picture - yes, everyone speaks with lofty voices about their mission to save the Earth, but in the end it's all about people saluting each other every time they walk into a room (seriously, every time someone saltues, take a drink and have 911 on standby to rush you to the hospital) and then apologize for some event that happened in the past and then go gung-ho on some random event that seems totally disconnected from the rest of the film.  The original series was a saga, a soap opera, but they had years to get through this material - here, you've got only over two hours and it happens so fast...until it happens so slow.  This is a film of fits.  One moment seventeen stories are going and then you get a long scene of nothing but one guy thinking to himself, staring slightly left to the camera and not sharing his thoughts.  The ending on the bridge as the final (last, totally, this it it, it's all over, people; watch me make the bold choice of going down with ship, it's really over, wait for it) sacrifice is about to be made - it goes on for forver, I feared it would never stop.  By the time the YAMATO finally is destroyed (taking the enemy down with it), I felt like a long stay in a boring room had finally come to an end.<br /><br />And this is another point - count the sets.  The Yamato is a big ship with a lot of room to move about, but the film limits us to a mere handful of rooms and most of those rooms you'll see are the main bridge (which, again, point of fact to the original series - you do see a lot of the bridge); which lacks any of the depth and interest of the original series.  It's grey, dull and the Captain's chair doesn't even go up and down (I waited the whole film for that, didn't happen).<br /><br />The Yamato itself is a high point in the film.  All the space shots, battles and the CGI work does, for any fan, send a true thrill through you.  It's beautiful, but so little time is spent with the ship, too few space battles and even less wave motion gun.  If you were to edit just the external scenes of the Yamato together it wouldn't run five minutes and that's plain wrong - the Yamato stands at the center of the story, here it's just something to be sacrificed at the end and you end up not caring.  It's one of the best ships in science fiction, even STAR TREK knows that people come just as much for the ENTERPRISE as the crew - here, not so much.<br /><br />A point on the music - as much as I love the original theme, it's used too much here to both over score and underscore the tension and mood.  It's played loud and brave in one moment then low and slow in the next (at points it borders on a dirge); there seems to have been little effort made to expand the score and what additions they have never rise high enough for you to even know it's there.  Whoever thought to get Steven Tyler from AREOSMITH to pen and sing the closing theme - put them in front of the wave motion gun and fire!, and then hit the ashes with the wave motion gun again, just to be sure.<br /><br />Overall, SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO takes too few chances and takes away far too much from the original for it to make any kind of connection.  It's too long, too unfocused and at its very worst feels just like an overhyped, pointless Hollywood production about battleships - we got that, don't need another.nt of the wave motion gun and fire!, and then hit the ashes with the wave motion gun again, just to be sure.<br /><br />Overall, SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO takes too few chances and takes away far too much from the original for it to make any kind of connection.

B004L3AR0K|2.0|The dvd that I received was ridiculously scratched up.  I would've returned it if I didn't get the movie as inexpensive as I did or even if the parts that I was able to see (probably 45 minutes were left unscathed) were up to par.  The movie itself was a letdown.  A part of me is glad that it was as scratched up as it was because now I won't feel as bad when I throw it away.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|I have used Nikon cameras for a long time and have always purchased the Nikon grip.  I had a d40x and d200 with the battery grip when I purchased the d800E.  I was hesitant to purchase this grip because of the price but the camera just did not feel right in my hand.  I bit the bullet and purchased the grip.  The camera just feels better in my hand.  That being said it really is expensive.  Now if I can only find an extra battery for the camera!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Apart from episode 24 \\"Getting Closer\\" and episode 25 \\"The Hollow Men\\", season 2 of Dollhouse is absolute perfection.  It's taken me quite awhile to find something as groundbreaking as Dark Angel is, and this surpasses DA in every way, shape, and form.  Unlike DA, Dollhouse gets even better during Season 2 instead of falling flat-on its face.  Eliza Dushku is absolutely flawless as the main character that this series follows.  This is an absolute must-see series for any fan of science fiction, futuristic plots, or even Dushku herself.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was fun, exciting and refreshing to read a book that evoke real feelings in today setting. A must read!
B0061S073A|4.0|good lock for kids.. ..allot of updates. i think i updated 3 times the first week. would recommend if you have kids.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Mirror Mirror on the wall, is this the greatest Snow White movie of them all? The answer to that question is no. And I had a feeling that this was going to be a pretty bad Snow White movie. But I gave it a chance because who knows it could have been a really great movie.<br /><br />Pros: Visually the fantasy was great I loved seeing the magical creatures and the forest and I liked how there was more of a back story to the Evil Queen as to why she became evil. The only good actors that shined were Chris Hemsworth (as the Huntsman)and Sam Claflin(as Prince William)and both actors were nice to look at too! But thats all.<br /><br />Cons: We already saw the best parts of the movie in the previews. The acting from Charlize Theron was over the top and she acted like a hormonal woman rather than an evil Queen. Kristen Stewerts acting as Snow White was terrible but not surprising. She had her mouth open a lot and didn't speak a whole lot except grunt and make sounds. She also had 2 looks on her face being confused or looking annoyed. And her british accent was akward and not believable. I also found out that many other actress's were considered for the part of Snow White but the director was probably desperate to make a movie. And the love triangle between her, The Huntsman and the Prince was ridiculous. It was like Twilight all over again. Sorry Twihards Edward and Jacob took a break from Bella! Can't we just have one main girl and one main guy be together? Enough already with the love triangles. Even with the love triangle when her true love kissed her YOU KNEW who he was and you knew who she was going to end up with. Even with the love triangle there wasn't enough romance.<br /><br />I think if the director wrote a better story and he had better actress's to play Snow White and the Evil Queen this movie would have stood a chance at doing great. But for people who haven't seen the movie yet I suggest you wait to watch it on t.v. or just rent it and then you decide whether its worth the buy or not. Just don't expect this movie to be an academy award winner or the acting to be believable.its worth the buy or not. Just don't expect this movie to be an academy award winner or the acting to be believable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a cute little game.  Graphics are good.  I think it's one of the better free games.  Give it a try since it is free.
0345803485|5.0|I've heard different comments on this so had to get it and read it for myself.  I must say though, to me, it was very interesting.  It wasn't like a 'turn on' book to me but it was the story line behind the two individuals.  And interesting in a way that I'm saying \\"hmmm, never thought of THAT before\\".  I loaned it to a friend to read and just ordered the next one.  Just got it last night and will be starting it here in a bit.  Enjoy!

After having a stroke I had problems holding &amp; reading my paper Bible; but now I can look up scriptures quickly &amp; choose different versions to see how they read; some versions will even read to me! I love listening to the voice they chose to do the reading too! Thank you YouVersion for helping to make life easier for me!
0345803507|5.0|Ok.  So I almost teared up and went through a long list of emotions reading this one.  I really liked it.  Oh!  I laughed out loud reading the bonus maaterial.
B0010358CG|3.0|Not as good as the first Appleseed 3D version, which I think is excellent.  The problem with this version?  John Woo.  His influence in the project is blatant...overuse of diving gun shots and fluttering flocks of doves is just abused in this film.  Abused to the point where flocks of doves flying around the camera is actually a plot device instead of just an annoyance!!  making it doubly annoying!!!  Also, the stylized 3D animation is nearly as well done as the first Appleseed 3D.
0345803485|4.0|I gave it a try and finished the trilogy.  I enjoyed the books.  People just look for anything to complain ...if you don't like it put it down.  I like it. A LOT!

B0064NTZJO|4.0|'<br />I'd been hearing about it for a while, and I had to admit I didn't get the buzz.  \\"It's a really great film!\\"  \\"This movie is really surprising people!\\"  \\"Ryan Gosling is terrific!\\"<br /><br />Ryan Gosling?  What?  The baby-faced guy from \\"The Notebook\\"?  The nut from \\"Lars and the Real Girl\\"?<br /><br />Yes--the same guy.  And boy, does he deliver.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" is a movie that will sit in your head for days after you see it.  This is a very strange film, not easily definable, and not at all what you think it's going to be.<br /><br />It's romantic.  It's very violent.  It has several twists in it that I found either shocking or disturbing, or both.  And it's a film that makes no bones about making it extremely difficult to pin characters down into easy stereotypes.<br /><br />Don't worry: I won't provide any spoilers.  I'll just say this: Gosling plays a near silent man named/described as, simply, Driver.  An absolute whiz behind the wheel, when he's not busy at his day job as a car mechanic or a Hollywood stunt driver he moonlights as a man who will drive questionable guys where they need to go, no questions asked.  Here's how he puts it...<br /><br />\\"There's a hundred-thousand streets in this city. You don't need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own.\\"<br /><br />And that's almost all he says throughout the film.  But he really doesn't need to...he speaks pages with those great eyes, whether he's admiring Irene, watching over her young son Benicio, or staring the hell out of some rotten guy who is trying to hurt them.<br /><br />In the manner of the great Steve McQueen, Gosling is able to express an awful lot with those baby blues, and his near silence really works to establish him as a man who speaks rarely but is by no means inexpressive.  It's hard not to latch on to his iconic smile when he sees Irene, and to understand his feeling of dismay when he finds out she has an ex-con husband who's coming home from prison in a couple of days.<br /><br />And that's when the trouble begins.  It's easy to see that Driver does best when he lives on his own terms, but now he feels he needs to watch out for Irene's loser of a husband and that's when things begin to get ugly.  I mean, real ugly.  And Driver finds himself embroiled in a war he didn't want, but to his credit he won't back away, either.  It's all in those eyes: you just know he won't let Irene or Benicio down.<br /><br />There's quite a pedigree in this film, too: Carey Mulligan is Irene, Albert Brooks is a crime boss, as is his hair trigger partner Ron Perlman, and Bryan Cranston is Gosling's boss at the garage,  There are several other young actors of note here as well, but much credit has to go to the movie's director, Nicolas Winding Refn, a Danish director who is no stranger to violent movies about the dark underbelly of life, most recently directing 2009's \\"Bronson,\\" starring Tom Hardy (soon to become Bane, Batman's formidable nemesis in \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\")  Refn does a fine job letting the film speak for itself, letting its actors walk a fine line between the notions of good and evil, making it very hard to pick absolutes within this film.<br /><br />In fact, when this movie is over it is very hard to clearly define anyone within this movie, and that includes Driver.  \\"Drive\\" is willing to allow itself to intermingle traditional concepts of right and wrong, and very few people can be easily categorized here.  It makes for interesting watching, and will probably make the film resonate for you for quite a while.<br /><br />If you hadn't guessed, I'm most impressed with Gosling, whom I'd thought was a simple hot chickflick guy who filled in the blanks when a romantic movie needed a hot dude.  But I realize now that he'd done the same thing in \\"The Notebook,\\" too.  Hesays a lot without saying a lot.  He definitely has acting chops.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to Gosling's next role, \\"Only God Forgives,\\" a Bangkok thriller pairing him with Refn once again.  Also along for the ride is Kristen Scott Thomas.  Gosling was reported as describing the script of \\"Only God Forgives\\" as \\"the strangest thing I've ever read and it's only going to get stranger.\\"<br /><br />And this from a man who made \\"Drive.\\"  I can't wait.says a lot without saying a lot.

0316056863|1.0|Even though I like Tina Fey's acting and comedy, I did not like her writing in this book. It wasn't that funny. I laughed maybe three times while reading the entire book. She was trying too hard with her jokes. It also showed me someone with a gargantuan ego who has a lot of false modesty.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This \\"author\\" should be charged for plagiarism! First of all, the plot, characters, state they live in, personalities etc... etc... etc... copy twilight to the point where I was sure James copied and pasted Meyers work and added a few porn scenes. The writing is horrible and repetitive. The same scene is written over and over and over. I was lured into reading the book because of all the hype is was getting and I was more than unimpressed. It was horrible. I do not think anyone should be rewarded for so obviously copying another person's idea and rewriting the same story with a tiny twist. What happened to original ideas and great writers? It is hard for me to believe that a book of this caliber is on the best seller list.  I will say that it is a very easy read with absolutely no depth. So if you have a few hours to spare and want to turn your brain to mush, indulge. My suggestion would be to pick up a trash magazine instead. My inner goddess was vomiting the entire time I read this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so great but the lag happens to make it only 4 stars worthy. I still love it though!

B008469DGY|5.0|graphics, mechanics and fun are all there. worth the 2 bucks and although similar to &quot;office jerk,&quot; is somehow much more enjoyable.
B007HNFREW|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing.  It captures what fans love most about one of the best fantasy series ever written almost as well as the novels do themselves, and it honors the author's story perfectly.  The story is wonderful and quite addicting, but also be prepared for a lot of adult themes including bloody violence, homosexuality, incest, prostitution, rape, and anything else shocking and revolting.  It made Mr. Martin focus and commit to finish his epic series that drew all of us into a wonderfully evil world of adventure and intrigue.  The cast is excellent, the acting mostly superior, though a few roles are obviously chosen for their look rather than their acting skills.  The only reviewers who talk down on the series are either too cool to love a good fantasy story or too proper and prudish to enjoy the bloody and sexually engaging storytelling.  If you want a true escape from reality into an epic world of swordplay, mischief, betrayal, honor, loyalty, sex, and adventure, then you too will soon be anxiously awaiting the spring 2013 release of Season 2.  While you wait for the new release, buy the novels or the audio books that are even more excellent and amazing.  Well written, well produced, excellently casted, and greatly loved is this epic fantasy series that only compares to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings with adult themes.
B00846WWVM|3.0|the graphics are nice, the game mechanics work... just lacks the &quot;addictive&quot; factor. I'm sure my 9 year old will dig it though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All I can say is wow!  I couldn't put this down and have ordered the prequel. Science fiction fans will love this and if you enjoy books with strong women characters, you will like this.

0061692042|5.0|There are already many reviews posted, so I'll stick to giving<br />my opinions about the book.<br /><br />This is an amazing work. At first it is hard to believe that it was written<br />by the author of \\"The Sports Writer\\".  It almost seems to be something by<br />Raymond Carver, if Raymond Carver had written a long novel.<br /><br />But then it becomes clear that it certainly is by Richard Ford - writing at<br />the top of his form.  The first person narrator is completely real<br />as in fact are _all_ of the characters.  And, through the slow<br />accumulation of many subtle, low key thoughts and remarks, we watch<br />Dell Parsons learn and develop.  We're inside his head as he gradually figures<br />out that his father lacked any real sense of himself and his mother is,<br />as she says, a weak person.  We get to join Dell as he gradually figures out<br />that Arthur Remlinger is a socio-path, a person for whom no living creature<br />except himself is real. They're all just \\"points of reference\\" for Arthur,<br />be they pheasants on the road or two foolish men from Detriot.<br /><br />The end of Dell's sister Berner's story feels just right, like something we should<br />have guessed the first time we saw her.<br /><br />Ford manages to create flawed but fascinating dynamic and evolving characters.  This<br />is comparable in execution to Flaubert, I think.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" is a joy to read, a melancholy one but a joy none<br />the less.

0345803485|1.0|Christian Grey is every woman's fantasy. A man who emails you back only seconds later, just magically shows up on his white horse to save the day, fulfills all your sexual needs and only has eyes for you even with the Charlize Theron look alike roommate portrayed in the book. WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP. This man does not exist and the author is a genius for playing on the imagination of all desperate woman around the world. KUDOS for that. However A Bestseller? HOW? this mess of a book was written so poorly with the same 10 words on every page \\"flush, blush, murmur, sated, chin cupping, lip biting\\" ugh I can go on and on. Does this author own a Thesaurus ???? Anyways watching my husband finger the X box controller in his boxers while getting updates on his phone about his sports agenda is the dose of reality I needed to pry away from this patheticness. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this app!! even if you don't know what this game is (if you don't, I am sorry for you) get it anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wait. I have to be 13?
0345803485|5.0|First off you people who are so judgemental have you even read the book???? YES it is somewhat of a \\"fantasy\\" life, but beyond the dom/sub and sex there is a true love story. I find myself drawn to the characters. I applaud EL James and I think that her writing is very amazing. She is writing to woman, and to be honest most MEN should be thankful that she has written such a HOT book b/c you might be getting more action than ever if ya wife would read it!!!! So rock on EL James I can't wait for the next series!!!!

I've seen this movie before, but for the price I had to add it to my collection of DVD's.  Watched it after receiving it and will be watching it again and again. And this was a true story of one man working very hard to bring joy and comfort to his fellow man. Ordered this dvd and received it in a few days...thank you Amazon.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|To all who mention age of author or reality of the story..HELLO THIS BOOK IS A FICTION...A FANTASY. No one who is reading this book should be younger than 18 maybe even 21 so lets be real. Tis is a fantasy.  A fantasy that we all dream about at one point or another. Weather its the good sex or the really hot man..maybe even the virgin. Its not meant to be real or realistic its meant to entertain your brain. I loved this book and cant wait to read part 2. I have no illusions that maybe this could be me or my life. Its a book...that's it and that's all

B002ZG99TA|4.0|This film was fun however it got a little corny about the last 20 or 30 minutes a bit over the top with people cheering like the winning field goal in the last seconds of the Super Bowl with the score tied and a 48 yard kick besides the corn it was good. I will always tell it like I see it.<br />Scott M

B0054JZC6E|4.0|i absoulutly love this product! It provides hours of fun for me and my friends. And its free!!! The only downside is the adds but they are small and easy to ignore. All in all i give it 4 stars. It would be five but the adds are slightly annoying.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Not sure what else I can say other than echo the many sentiments here.  This was an amazing book, very similar in feel to the Kingkiller books.  Do not be put off by the pricing or by the fact that it's an e-book. This was very well written with excellent pacing, great characters, and a deeply engaging plot.  As someone said, it's a very bad idea to start this book on a weekday since you will lose much sleep! This book is also long but it was so well written that the pages flew by since I had to see what happened next.  Many series starters also leave you with an unresolved plot with a cliff hanger since they spend most of the book building the world and characters.  Not so with this book!  This book had a very satisfying ending and the book stood on its own but also left enough questions hanging to have me craving for the next book in the series.<br /><br />Only thing I would suggest is perhaps do a second edit to make sure all the misspellings are corrected and the appropriate words are used.  There were a few instances where I had to fill in the correct word. (I think it was stuff like \\"he\\" instead of \\"the\\" etc.) I want to mention that these were very minor as well.<br /><br />Also the \\"magic\\" in the book was a little nebulous, perhaps to be fleshed out a little more in the next book.  Anyway, I highly recommend this gem and can't wait for the next book in the series.<br /><br />Edit: March 2013 - I re-read this book recently due to the update and realized that there are even more numerous grammatical and editing issues than before.  This is puzzling since this book is now with a major publisher but there are now sentences that have lost their periods altogether and have been fused together with a comma which made the entire passage confusing. Sometimes it was just a fragment and missing a noun altogether.  It is apparent that the author has gone back and revamped some of the narratives and added/clarified more details since I last read this book.  Although someof the added details are appreciated, some of the prose seem very fragmented and I'm afraid I can no longer consider this as a 5 star book.  I hope this is not the version that will be sold as hardcover!

0307474259|5.0|This was a great book--my favorite of all the books I've read about insulin resistance and how we can lose fat and be healthy and possibly free from disease.  Taubes has been criticized for repetition, but when he repeats himself it is necessary for the complete understanding of the subject.<br /><br />My only criticism is that on his eating plan all types of oils and artificial sweeteners can be eaten.  From all my research, I know that refined oils and artificial sweeteners are very bad for us.  So I don't understand why he gives all oils and sweeteners the stamp of approval.<br /><br />Here's a question I'd like answered: Taubes' research proves that eating fewer carbs helps fat people become lean and free of diabeties and many other diseases. But is this the way we all  should eat to be healthy and free of disease?
B001NLKT60|4.0|A great read in this sequel to the \\"Girl with the dragon tatoo.\\" A bit graphic in details of rape situations ...I guess it's up to the reader to deal with the picture pasted from it on the mind. Overall I like the crime solving aspect so it's great.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|I was really enjoying this book when just after the halfway point I got an almighty shock & I sat there for a few minutes totally dumbfounded. Martin throws some unexpected & amazing curveballs at you particularly in the second half of this book & more so than in any of the previous books in this series. If you don't like having your mind blown away & have an aversion to awesomeness you should steer clear of this book. For everyone else, ENJOY.

B003O86FMW|4.0|BTW please disregard my typos...its not easy typing on your kindle...<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Well, I loved 3/4 of it. I took off a star because the beginning of the book in District 12 was so boring and non thought provoking I was literally skimming the pages until something interesting would come up. it was like Collins was just throwing a bunch of random stuff in thre beginning without any emotion or action just to make it as long as the last one.<br /><br />BUT the part when Katniss finds out that she would have to enter the games once again was the ice breaker. I was hooked revived from my mute feelings at the beginning. In fact i thoought it felt like whole seperate story than from the beginning. Collins has once again exceded my expectations and i was overwhelmed by th creativity she brought and loaded on to this amazing sequel to the hungergames. She made amazing characters and an even better seres of events that just keep on coming and coming. I almost started crying once I finished the bok and downloaded the third witbin seconds after i finished.<br /><br />Now, on to the characters. I believethat the author could have drew up Peeta a little mor since he was Katniss's biggest objective to save him. I wish he could have amped up the romance with Katniss like in the first book but it seems as if that feeling is completely gone.<br /><br />Next, Finnick Odair. Oh my godfather fromthe moment he talked to Katniss about her'dirty secrets' and learned how he acted in the games, i seriously fell in lov with him!No joke. i thought he had the most attributes tht actually made him seem like a real person. And not to mention during the mockingjay portion ofhe 'clock' and at he end when  he started crying about his love Annie, ialmost cried too! Who doesnt love Finnick?<br /><br />All in all, Catching Fire was an amazing book that left the Hunger Games in its dust. Even though the beginniing was excruciatingly slow, the end definetely made up for it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome I really enjoy playing it all the time.I recommend this game for everyone. you will love it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have read the stereotypical young adult novels like Harry Potter, Twilight, Riordan series, etc. nd kept putting this on off over and over again thjnking What else is there to be written? surely after the hundreds of other books all there was to be original is probably used numerous time and this is some mixmatch vampire zombie wanna be bok that is most ljkely jusst a rewrite of another book. Boy was i wrong!<br /><br />I loved this book more than any other tht i had read before and thouhtthe them and originality was mind blowing. She dveloped emotions that were so powerful i was literally sucked into the book and couldnt get out for hours at a time. In my opinion, i wouldnt have don he story in Katniss's POV or would have made her character more interesting and unique. But kudos fo reviving this world tha is just dripping with cheesy teen dramas.<br /><br />I took off a star because i thouh that she couldve made th other tributes a littl more expressive in the book. I know it was a game to see which person would com out alive out of 23 others, but she could have made them talk more or express unique feelings tha placed each of the players apart. I also hink tha instead of using one persons point of view she couldve made it first person omniscient or head hopped so hat we ould understand the story better.<br /><br />I lik te way tha she had peeta be soomewhat of an enigma at the beginning then have him just pour out at the end. I hope tha peeta gets katniss inhhe end.<br /><br />P.S.  Sorry for the typos... its hard typing on your kindle!!

0307592731|4.0|As a chicken who wouldn't even walk in a county park by myself, I was impressed at young Cheryl Strayed's decision to hike the Pacific Coastal Trail (think: left coast version of Appalachian Trail) at all, much less all alone, backpacking for two-plus months. At times it felt like an adult version of one of my most favorite books of all time, \\"My Side of the Mountain,\\" where the little boy runs away from home and hollows out a tree and makes his (quite cozy) home there for the whole winter.<br /><br />I enjoyed Strayed's accounts of how she did things, how she packed the enormous, too-heavy backpack, how she cared for her bruised, blistered feet, how she counted her pennies (literally) and every few weeks walked several miles into a town to pick up a package and have a real meal, maybe cadge a shower, before hitting the trail again.<br /><br />I loved her story of her mother, her mother's hard life (and therefore the author's hard life as a child) and tragic, too-young death, and Cheryl's anger at her mother as she comes to terms on the trail with her harsh, harsh loss(es).<br /><br />As with any memoir, I found myself wondering how, years later, the author remembers such tiny details and can write them accurately into a memoir. She doesn't mention keeping a diary on the trail. She mentions reading books and then burning the pages she reads, to lighten her load. But not writing in a journal. Yet she recounts tiny details, rocks, leaves, mountains, expressions on people's faces, in chronological order, things that took place over a 60-day period, 20 years ago.<br /><br />And as with any memoir, or fiction for that matter, some parts dragged for me. There was a point where we had heard it all before...the long walk, the setting up the tent, the hike into town, the disappointment when yet again a package isn't at the post office as hoped. I began to skim quickly about two-thirds of the way through, impatient with the repetition of wilderness descriptions and kind of inane and unimportant interactions with men she met on the trail. I was looking for the real meat of the story, which for me was Cheryl's coming to terms with why she was on that trail, and her grief about her relationship with her mom.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, a very satisfying read, she's a talented writer with a great story.<br /><br />Side note: I hear Reese Witherspoon has optioned the book and plans to star. Love Reese but she's TOO OLD at 36. Cheryl was 22 - 23 when she did this.ane and unimportant interactions with men she met on the trail.

159308322X|4.0|This is definitely a classic story. If you have read other classics you'll see many similarities between Collin's writings and later authors like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and even Bram Stoker. The author makes the characters very familiar to you in his method of passing the story to different characters. This does make the story move a little slow at times and the story lingered a little longer than I believe it should have. This story is written in the style of many of the great authors of that general period. If you like the stories by great authors like Dickens, Dostoevsky and Hugo, you will comfortable with the author's writing and you should appreciate how far ahead of his times he was regarding detective stories.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|J Edgar is worth watching. My husband and I both enjoyed it, I think I a bit more than he. The acting was terrific. Leonard DiCaprio was especially impressive, and so was Armie Hammer (the Winklevoss twins in \\"The Social Network\\") as his longtime companion. Their scenes were heartwrenching. The American historical aspects of the movie were fascinating, but confusing. I admit I knew almost nothing about Hoover or the FBI before the movie. After watching it, I'm not sure if I learned anything, since I don't know how much of it is true or not, a la an Oliver Stone movie. I am interested in the subject now, and will read more about the man who started the FBI.<br /><br />That said, I'm surprised Clint Eastwood let the dark lighting get through the final cut. Was the darkness supposed to be \\"arty\\"? Symbolic of how \\"shady\\" these times were, you were never sure of what you were seeing, truth or half truth, etc.? Whatever, it was annoying. At times I literally could not see enough of each face to have identified the actor moments later in a lineup. Crowd scenes are so dark, men in dark suits completely blend in to the background and you can't make any distinctions. That got very tedious and cut down my interest level.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, it is worth watching, for the performances.

0307730697|5.0|I have read several books in the last couple of years pertaining to SEALS and their missions and training, starting out with LONE SURVIVOR and SEAL TEAM SIX . This book , FEARLESS ,  is the only book, pertaining to SEALS,  book that I dreaded to continue to read. Why? Because I didn't want it to end. In fact, I was so into this book that I am going to read it again before I let any of my buddies get a chance to borrow it.  I have never felt so emotionally touched ( and drained) by a book as I have with FEARLESS. I am an old Marine who has seen alot, (nothing like Adam Brown and his team, mind you), and never really showed much emotions, but I had to issue a &#34;hanky alert', dur to extreme &#34;eye sweat&#34; when I got to the end of the book that describes Adam's death. In fact, If you haven't viewed the promotional video here on Amazon.com about the book, check out this web-site  ... [...].<br />  There is also another website that the author gives you toward the end of the book that has a two part video of interviews with the friends and family of Adam that is not seen on the previous web-site, including the interview with his family on the night they were informed of his death by that dreaded &#34;knock on the door&#34; late at night.<br />  I believe this book has made me a better father and man. I'll never forget Adam Brown and only hope that I can become a fraction of the man he was.<br /><br />UPDATE  (03/01/15)...<br />  Well, I screwed up and allowed my nephew to borrow my copy. It's been over a year now and haven't heard from him or seen the book since... So I finally gave up on ever getting the copy back. I re-ordered another copy last week (paperback edition) and have began reading it again. I last read it back in 2012, and could not believe how much I had forgotten .  It is definitely one of those books that you will read over and over.  I highly recommend it, along with other books by Eric Blehm. Which BTW, he has one coming out soon about a Green Beret legend back in 'Nam

0525423281|5.0|There's just something about the way Stephanie Perkins tells her stories that make you want to \\"aww\\" all the way through. Her characters are always affable and they quickly get under your skin, her storylines (although simple and not particularly spectacular in their originality) still make you impatiently leaf through the pages wanting to know what happens next, and her writing is a blend of wit, humour, and romance.<br /><br />I could not put this book down, and was disappointed at how quickly it ended. I really wanted it to go on for much longer than it actually did and it's worse knowing that the next Stephanie Perkins book won't be out for a while. I also loved seeing Anna and Etienne and witnessing how their relationship has developed and matured.<br /><br />I'm actually not sure which I prefer more, this book or Anna and the French Kiss. They both had their own flair and appeal, I finished them both in one sitting and they both made me feel the same way. Sigh. Confused.<br /><br />I'll say one thing though, the way Lola reacted when she heard Cricket was back and that whole mystery (which didn't remain a mystery for long) behind what happened between her and Cricket in the past was over-exaggerated in my opinion. Yes, I would've been hurt and angry as well, but seeing him again years later, her reaction seemed a little over the top. I expected something a lot more serious to have occurred than what it actually turned out to be.<br /><br />Also, Cricket is such a sweetheart. SUCH A SWEETHEART!! Like, seriously, he is SUCH a sweetheart. Okay, I think I've said it enough times now.<br /><br />Great book. This is a book I can see myself reading again in future.

0439023513|1.0|This story was so bad that I was expecting \\"The One Ring\\" to show up on Katniss's finger to explain her behavior.  When you find yourself rooting for the capital citizens and the peacekeepers to kill off the main character then maybe there's something wrong with the novel.  I felt like action was being put into the novel to fill up pages.  Deaths became meaningless, just more pages to fill.  The heart and soul in The Hunger Games was completely vaporized in Mockingjay.  I feel like the author made her money on the first novel and just threw words together for the conclusion.<br /><br />The only plus I can add is that I would like to see a novel on Beetee and how he won his Hunger Game.

B000HAEK4A|5.0|Fans of Mad Men will notice that Christina Hendricks guest stars as the erstwhile Mrs. Reynolds in this episode and reprises her role in a later episode in the series. As always she is lovely and a lot of fun, as is the episode and the entire run of Firefly. When I first heard Firefly described as a cross between sci-fi and a western, I was a bit dubious, but I have never yet been disappointed and the shows remain fresh even with repeated viewings. I highly recommend the entire series for writing, acting and social commentary.<br /><br />In this particular episode, Mal takes care of a thief that has been preying on a small community and finds himself with a wife in payment. The rest of the crew is amused and amazed and as usual finds themselves in trouble. Getting themselves out of trouble requires even more finesse than usual. A great episode of a wonderful show. Do yourself a favor and watch them all and then watch [[ASIN:B001HBYHFA Serenity]], which finishes the story. Great sci-fi with Whedon's characteristic wit and pathos.

1600597963|5.0|Jaime Cloud Eakin first wowed me with [[ASIN:1579907180 Beading with Cabochons: Simple Techniques for Beautiful Jewelry (Lark Jewelry Books)]], which introduced me to bead embroidery as a jewelry technique. In Dimensional Bead Embroidery, Eakin expands and enhances her earlier techniques allowing her readers to learn every aspect of bead embroidery and construction but to know enough to design their own pieces. Each chapter is clear and concise and focused on an aspect of bead embroidery. It helps that the steps are arranged in an order that makes sense. Finally, there are the projects and the inspiration pieces from both Eakin and other bead embroidery artists.<br /><br />I recommend this book first for the amazingly clear instructions. Eakin truly makes her diagrams and photos easy to follow even for the rank beginner. Second, the organization of the various steps to the process are well explained and well organized, these two things are far more important than the just as wonderful inspiration and eye candy. Eakin's books are recommended to anyone who wishes to learn bead embroidery. Top Notch!

0140143505|5.0|84 Charing Cross Road is filled with the love of life and the love of books and is timeless and charming with a tinge of heartbreak. Helene Hanff wanted nice copies of used English books when she began corresponding with a used bookshop in London and she got more books than she could ever have imagined, but she also got several life-long friendships, beginning with the manager of the bookshop on Charing Cross Road, Frank Doel. Hanff was a writer in television, novels, textbooks and articles and well known in her time, in addition to being politically active. Hanff's correspondent was a mild-manner manager in a bookshop, beloved by all who knew him, but easily overlooked with the usual English reserve.<br /><br />Their correspondence, along with several other employees of the shop and extended family of employees covers more than two decades and begins with post-war rationing still in place and ends with screaming fans of the Beatles and the rise of Carnaby street - quite a progression in the England of the twentiety century. These letters are full of life and humor and every human emotion. The book reads quickly, but that is all right because as soon as the last page is turned, eager readers will begin again looking for favorite passages. Highly recommended to all sorts of readers but especially those who love English books and England.
0307474712|4.0|This book was beautifully written and very hard to  put down. Emma and Dexter's relationship evolves over the course of many years and their lives take very different paths. I really don't want to say to much, giving away the beauty of this book. I could not put it down and I have reread it twice. This book is sad, so it may not appeal to some readers but for me it shows that life, love and relationships are not perfect, hard and take a lot of work.
0062060562|3.0|I've given her 3 stars because I liked the first 200 pages. The next 100 pages dragged for me. I  began to skim, but it was tolerable. However, that last section at Brighton was absolutely incredulous. \\"She set us up for THAT unbelievable ending?\\" I yelled as I closed the book.<br /><br />Another problem I had is that the dust jacket says Watson lives in London, but she certainly hasn't caught the British dialog. At times I had to remind myself that the story took place in London and they were English. For example, several times she referred to being in A hospital or going to THE hospital. She didn't seem to know about the boot and the bonnet of a car. Even worse, the dialog sound too American and spoiled part of my reading pleasure.<br /><br />I liked her writing style and voice. I think she has promise.

B0071LLHGC|5.0|I consider myself to be somewhere between an uber-casual to avid \\"Up to Duane's death\\" Allman's fan. I own all the studio stuff (+ Dreams) up to \\"Brother's and Sister's\\" and all the legitimately released live stuff from that period. I have to say, IMHO, that this performance is just a notch below \\"Fillmore East\\", maybe half a notch. Sonically it's not going to set new standards, they may have been a tad more possessed on @FE, but the mix is fantastic. Greg's vocals and keyboards are clear as a bell for the most part, Duane and Dickie almost manage to yet again sound like the world's first and only four armed guitar player and Barry, JJ and Butch do not disappoint either...but then when did they ever?<br /><br />Does the music world need any further proof that Duane Allman was one of only 5 or 6 guitarists that ever really mattered? Well, here it is and 40 years later we can only guess where his frightening talent may have taken him. I played this for a friend on the way home from work yesterday and he said that he loved \\"Southern Rock\\". I almost pulled over and asked him to get out. \\"THIS IS NOT SOUTHERN ROCK\\" I almost screamed. Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet and Charlie Daniels are Southern Rock bands, these guys are Musicians.

B000002BE9|3.0|It is hard to believe that 16 years have passed since \\"Tidal\\", Apple's debut album, was released back in 1996.  At the time Apple was a mere teenager, but had a wealth of raw talent and an incredible voice that sounded much more mature than her young age would indicate.  Although I find this album rather average and not on the same level as some of her later material, her green talent comes through in spades, and it is obvious that this girl had a very promising future.  This is one of those rare albums where I actually think the hit single (\\"Criminal\\") is the best song on the disc.  The way Apple sings it again sounds much more mature and experienced than an 18 year old normally would, but that is part of what makes the song as strong as it is.  Other highlights include \\"Sleep To Dream\\", \\"Shadowboxer\\" and \\"Carrion\\".  On the negative side, some of the lyrics resort to cliché's and tend to reflect some level of immaturity in her songwriting development.  Even though Apple's voice is beautiful, she occasionally gets slightly off key here and there on the album, which again is an indication of her level of experience at this point in her career.  Overall this album is worth owning, but compared to the two albums that came after this one, I would rate this lesser of the three.
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy is very nice, sometimes it reminds me Twilight, because some of the dialogues are much the same, but at some point the kind of kinky love story that is developed trought the book remains and takes on its own. So it´s love, some kind of spiced up love story where sex is key for communication between the main characters. Easy to read and quite enterteining!!!
B005LAIGZU|3.0|\\"Act of Valor\\" is an action picture with a difference:  It features actual Navy SEALS in staged scenes of what they have been trained to do.  In the wake of the SEALS' successful assassination of Osama bin-Laden, the movie seems equally a recruiting video and a gripping drama of men under pressure who never lose their cool and always stay focused on a mission's goal.<br /><br />The plot concerns a SEAL team doing its part to save the United States and its citizens from international bad guys.  It takes the team from one exploit to another, often showing in minute detail how well coordinated team members are and how it is often necessary to communicate silently when discovery could mean death.  Team members are referred to only by their first names, such as Lt. Commander Rorke and Special Warfare Operative Dave.  The rest of the cast are actors.<br /><br />The villains are broadly drawn -- Mexican drug cartel members, Chechnyan crime kings, and a drug smuggler turned jihadist.  They don't quite twirl their mustaches and scowl at the camera, but directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh aren't exactly subtle.  They actually appear at the beginning of the film, claiming its authenticity and warning of its no-holds-barred images.  Whether to hype the picture or give it a documentary feel, their appearance seems contrived.<br /><br />\\"Act of Valor\\" has the look and feel of any number of World War II movies.  We get to know the principals as they engage in gun battles and covert missions, and they are portrayed as almost supermen in their ability to read, outthink, and outshoot their enemies.<br /><br />Blu-ray extras include interviews with each of the Navy SEALS, deleted scenes, directors' commentary, and several featurettes including a making-of documentary and a look at the tactics employed by Navy SEALS.  \\"Act of Valor\\" is also available on DVD.
0307594165|4.0|Toni Morrison's latest novel (or novella) is a compact tale tackling the broad subject of \\"home\\". Frank Money is a veteran  returns to the US after serving in the Korean War. Like most Black soldiers of that time, he's returning to a country that could care less about his service and the trauma that he's experienced. Frank works hard at trying to achieve some level of normalcy and overcome the memories that he can't escape. He receives news that his younger sister, Cee, is in trouble and must pull himself together enough to come to her aid.<br /><br />As usual, Morrison's writing is beautiful and descriptive, making even the smallest detail appear paramount to the story. It's hard to believe that a book that is only about 160 pages long could contain a wealth of storytelling. The plight of Black people in the 1950's is fully explored here: returning soldiers, travelling the country under Jim Crow laws, medical research exploitation, and much more. Morrison's incredible talent assures that no matter how many physical pages there are, her stories are always fully told.
B00316DDUE|5.0|I love Yanni's concert at the Acropolis very much and looked forward to a blu-ray edition instead of buying his other concerts on DVD. Alas, the man decided instead to release \\"The Concert Event\\" on blu-ray. And this one is just as good as the other, although the format here is some departure from \\"Acropolis\\".<br /><br />In Acropolis Yanni plays with the backing of a large Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra in a show tailored to the taste of Greek aristocrats (and their counter parts else where)- the ghost of Plato was milling in the crowd. This concert, which follows years later, incorporates a number of exotic musical instruments and musicians selected to give it an international flair. The tempo is often upbeat. All of which may be a good thing. After all there is no point buying two concerts that are nearly identical in all aspects.<br /><br />The DVD version of this concert is very good in both video and audio quality but playing the blu-ray on HDTV is visually more pleasing.
1582701709|4.0|This is a very simple book with a simple message...it took me six readings of the book to finally get it. I think mostly because of resistance to the message. I keep a copy in the lav and read a couple of pages each day, then start again from the beginning. Each time I get something I missed on previous readings. Good way to start the day. Basically, stay out of your head...be here now...and project out what you want, not what you don't want.

Joining Noah Wyle are Moon Bloodgood as Dr. Anne Glass, a pediatrician who has become the survivors' primary physician, Will Patton as Colonel Weaver, the gruff and emotionally scarred commander of Second Massachusetts, and Drew Roy as Tom's oldest son, who is just about to turn 18.<br /><br />\\"Falling Skies\\" attracted more than 6.9 million viewers in its first season on TNT and was basic cable's Number One new series of 2011, according to Nielsen Media Research.  The three-disc DVD and two-disc Blu-ray sets include all ten episodes from the first season along with such special features as a sneak peek at Season Two, commentary tracks, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.

B004LROMSY|4.0|If you are a fan of Eva Green, then by all means get this series. She is excellent as Morgan. The other actors are ok. This is not as good as the HBO series Game of Thrones. I think the writing so far is average at best. The production values are first rate, a pity the story is less well done. I give it 3 starts for Eva Green  and one the the rest.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I have this app on my iPhone and iPod Touch, and it helps me go into a relaxing sleep.  When I fell upon it here, I felt what is the better way to enhance my reading experience on my Kindle Fire but to play while I am reading a juicy novel on the bus, train and during lunch.  Pure escapism.  I also listen to it while reading at night to lull me to sleep.  A relaxing atmosphere, indeed! The only reason why I did not give it a 5 is because I am able to combine sounds on my Apple products, but it only appears to allow you to listen to one sound at a time on the K-Fire.  It may be a function that I haven't found, yet, but if it does not, I sincerely hope that the developers find a way to allow this on the Kindle, also.
0894803123|4.0|I truly do not understand why some people are rating this item with two or three stars. Yes, I has kid like pictures; however it's a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream book and the book matches the wild personalities and off the wall thinking of their ice cream flavors.<br />I'm a novice and the recipes are simple to follow.
B000025RX4|5.0|I remembering getting this ALBUM when I joined Columbia House record club WAY back.<br />One of my friends told me to get it. I hated it at first - dont know why. Then Guess Ill Go Away kicked in and Prodigal Son, On a Limb and the funny - Aint That A Kindness - I was hooked.Good stuff!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lloooovvvveeeee so entertaining. I am traveling so it os keeping me busy. what more can I ask for from a free game
145551389X|5.0|quality and quantity are just perfect. MUST HAVE for little monsters. And I guarantee, you won't disappointed. really get to know GAGA
B004132HZS|1.0|The first episode was excellent. The rest were a series of quick visual and mental tricks that flattened the other episodes and made them hard to follow. This series' treatment of \\"the lady\\" was insulting to the original in which Irene was a women who could take care of herself. The Baskerville episode removed the emotional fun of the original story.<br /><br />I think when this series sticks to creating its own story it works, but when it rewrites the classic pieces it disintegrates into jerky pieces of drama that do not entertain.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|Ok, first and foremost, I want to inform everybody that this movie was very much liked by Bethany Hamilton herself. She thought AnnaSophia Robb did a great job at portraying her. Bethany even said during an interview with AnnaSophia that she picked her out herself and I think everyone should give credit to her for doing the best job she could have possibly done. Much of the other people that were portrayed were also on the set as it was being made. I give it a four star because the acting wasn't the best and could have been better but wasn't worth one star. I really think it was rude of people to trash talk it since it was based off of the book Soul Surfed written by Bethany Hamilton. Also since Bethany herself thinks it did a fairly good job. Even if Bethany thought the scene at the hospital wasn't actually how it was, she still thought it was a good scene to have.<br />The clothing situation I mean is like IT'S HAWAII AND IT IS SURFING BASED!!!!<br />Another thing is the end.  Bethany in this scene never said she did or didn't want to go back to that day.  She just said that she wouldn't change what happened.<br />This is all I'm going to say before I start going off on random rants to those who gave it a one star rating.<br />This is by the way a girl not Randall.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|It restores one's faith when they actually carry an intelligent, thrilling, and fun TV series for another season.  We loved the first season and couldn't wait for this one to arrive.  When it did we immediately opened it and started watching. The episodes are delightful.  I was impressed how they changed the storyline of \\"The Hounds of the Baskervilles\\" to make it current.  If you enjoyed the first season you will definitely want this set as well.  Those unfamiliar with the series will enjoy it if you like the premise of a modern day Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Watson, Moriarity, and the rest.  Exceptional performances and a great detective series.  If you enjoyed this, be sure to check out [[ASIN:B001BLM15O Time After Time]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B000006UD8|5.0|The rock n roll hall of fame is a joke as long as this band is not in there. Machine Head is one of the best ever. Ian Gillan has the greatest scream in the business and he shows it on this one.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|If you like amazing stories or amazing dreams this is the movie for you,don't be desapointed!<br />Specialy if you like unbeliable stories about normal people.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its great could allow u to play faster though. I don't buy any extra anything because it is expensive to play a game that keeps making u spend money. that is the only bad thing with this game.
B007R21JJK|5.0|It's a mobo. If you know what that means and it has the features you want, buy it.<br /><br />NB: it is a DVI-D, not a dual-link, which means it won't drive the bigger monitors. Therefore the video support is useless unless your monitor is 1600x1200 or smaller.
B004G6009K|5.0|I bought this movie without actually seeing the whole film before. I had heard that it was a cute movie, and from the few scenes that I had seen here and there, (not to mention that Pascal is so cute) I decided to get it and I am so glad I did. I have watched it several times since I have received it. First, the color and animation of the film in Blu-ray ( I watched it on a 1080p screen) is very good, not to mention it has a great story line. It is has been such a long time since Disney has produced a good \\"fairy tale\\", comparable to it's past films. I strongly recommend getting this movie, whether in Blu-ray or DVD, it is cute, and funny, and it will leave you feeling like you're a kid again. :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|My friend has this on his IPad and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad they finally have it on kindle fire! Before there was only the paid packs you had to buy seperately. This version allows you to download other free puzzle packs as well as the paid packs so that you can access them all from a single app. Very convenient!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  I was so sad when it was over.  I found that it kept my interest from the beginning to the end.  I only wish that the Night Circus was a real thing... described beautifully, I would follow it to the ends of the earth. Highly recommend this wonderful tale.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|So I have just finished chapter 1 and I have to say it wasn't easy.  I had to make myself finish it.  There were a couple moments that grabbed my attention but the majority of it was slow, unecessary and drawn out.  The first book I read was \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" and that was in high school about 15 years ago.  I didn't read another book until recently when I read \\"The Hunger Games\\" triligy.  Now I am addicted to the enjoyment of a good book and I had high hopes for this one but so far I have been greatly let down.  I was affraid of this and that is why I didn't read another book until recently.  Thanks for reading.<br /><br />OK, I'm on chapter 7 now and still there are really slow spots.  I definitely can tell this book was written by a women that has a seriously distorted view of reality.  It has some good moments.  I think I'm going to try to fish it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I love it.its fun and addictive. temple run is the best app ln the store<br />temple run yeah
B0086700CM|4.0|This is great fun - I still love Angry Birds (all types) the best but this is surely a good reflex tester. AB is more strategy - this is more MOVES!! Highly recommend especially for a rainy day. Give it a try - it's free after all. Thank you Amazon -
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great fun and an increasing challenge. So simple at first, but then look out.  Excellent work noodle geeks, five stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game will keep you occupied for hours. as long as you can tell the difference between items that cost real money and things that cost coins it is completely free! I definitely recommend this app.
B0086700CM|4.0|i like this app but the only thing is that i was suprized it dident coast alot of money but over all i thaught it was really good
B0000E1ALR|5.0|THIS CD IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  I HAD THIS CD AND IT BROKE.  SO GLAD I FOUND IT AGAIN.  ITEM ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.  WOULD USE THIS SELLER AGAIN.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|Tom Cruise was a lot more than I expected and would have given it a higher rating except a few days later I watched the recent 007 films, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. They pale in comparison. The photography, the writing, the acting and so forth are all far better in the Bond films. That said I enjoyed Ghost Protocol too. It ran at a faster pace. Had an interesting story. It's an adventure film which runs from scene to scene until the climax. I've watched it several times. Nevertheless it's not a gripping film like Casono Royale with Daniel Craig and Judy Dench which commands your attention from start to finish. Ghost Protocol is the best of the Mission Impossible he series. People were quite right. The films got better as the series continued. Great second hand buy.
B008518MOW|1.0|$50?!!!???? Does Will Smith come with this Blu ray? This is so outrageous. It feels like a test to see what customer are willing to spend on a movie. Wait till it goes on sell.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Miss Peregrine certainly has some peculiar children. There are even pictures to prove it. Haunting pictures. The protagonist faces many fears and learns a lot about himself and his mysterious grandfather. This book was truly original and I loved how it wove some of the atrocities of living in wartime through the magic of time travel. Will the lead character decide to stay with the children in the past or will he decide his place is with is family in the present? Adults and children will equally enjoy this tale.<br /><br />Colleen<br />Author - Because of the Moon<br /><br />[[ASIN:0973579811 If I Was The Mayor]]
B0059XTUVI|5.0|From what I remember of seeing Mrs. Thatcher in the media Meryl Streep exhibited a convincing representation of her personality, passion and presence.<br /><br />I was hoping to getting a good reveal of her relationship with Queen Elizabeth II, but there was no mention of The Queen.<br /><br />The movie seemed to show that she was out of touch with the poorest people who suffered the most from the status of the economy. Mrs. Thatcher seem to expect the same show of strenth and stringent sactifice the English people had in dealing with conditions during the WWII.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it but I just don't like that u have to start over<br />:) but its pretty cool :)
B007L96VCY|5.0|I really enjoy all the other points of view  here, you mean that there are other people in the world who care about this stuff too? I can't top the more in-depth reviews of the music-very interesing reading.  However people still going on over the \\"hostilities\\" between John and Paul?  That is so 40 years ago. Paul and John went through a damn divorce from each other,people say hurtful things to distance themselves from the pain they were experiencing, they grew past it, honestly, they were fine and remained close with each other until John's death. Arguing over who is the better artist?  Who gives a s***!  I recommend you embrace all the joy they both have brought to you in your life.  As I see it this album was a retort, a  second solo \\" I'm BACK.  I am going to do my own thing, in my own way, and I AM GOING TO HAVE A TON OF FUN\\" why, because I am allowed to be a normal person album. Paul was not particularly concerned if whether the lyrics were heavy and cool--(slaving to create heavy lyrics kind of kills the fun aspect you see). Let's face it-- the man (in colloboration with John) had already been there done that (several times over), he was indeed coming out of a deep depression post Beatles break-up.  The pure joy and love that Paul had creating this music carries every song. If you have really dug into the biographies and \\"get\\" Paul you will \\"get\\" some of the songs here that might not musically bowl you over.  My personal favorites:\\" Too Many People\\", \\"Smile Away\\", the easy melody and musical facility of \\"Heart of the Country\\", \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" is  TOTAL FUN celebrating domesticity, the long fadeout to me captures what it must be like inside Paul's head,a vulnerable genius letting stream of consciousness light-hearted melody making all hang out. Paul has the confidence to put this out here as he knows and we know that this is only one facet of his seeming unlimited musical range and repertoire. BTW whoever said Paul is no longer cool, has lost their mind.nd.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|It keeps your attention from start to finish. It was well written, well cast, directed and so forth. The first film can be seen alone but should be seen with the second one. I liked Casino Royale better than Quantum of Solace
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|LOVE IT! The extra large numbers are great! Makes balancing my checkbook so much easier. It's convenient too for figuring tips etc...
B000059RL3|5.0|a masterpiece that revolutionized black music. It's rich with grooves to it's boundless sense of possibilities. What's Going On is the Sgt. Pepper of soul.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and I love this game. We try and see who can get the highscore (he usually wins). very fun game.
B007X038BI|5.0|Madonna the Only queen of Pop... Did it agai. With this awesome single !! And the remixes are splendid!!! L-U-V Madonna!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I for one would watch it again. Everything about it was wondeful, the action, the drama and especially the humor. Joss whedon has proven to be great at making films. I would suggest he do more marvel films.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|There's a problem with the star system. Let me explain. I would easily give Casino Royale a B+ and Quantum of Solace a B- but I am obliged to give both films 4 stars. Quantum got off to an excellent start with the automobile chase. The organization is chasing after Bond with Mr. White in the trunk of the car. The connection to the first film is established with the delivery of Mr. White to British Intelligence. So far so good but then it kills Mr. White. It was a mistake. They should have spent more time on the development of Felix Leiter and Rene Mathis. Perhaps from a clue left by Mr. White during interogation Bond reaches Haiti it should have reached Haiti and Mr. Greene sooner. Instead Bond goes on some escapade with little to do with the story. With a better story line the film would have matched the success of the first film. Perhaps a better plan would have been to simply forget the first film and the opening with Mr. White and there would be no need to worry about the other film.
B000002OTL|4.0|I have to say I enjoy this soundtrack very much over the years, just now getting around to writing the review of it.  I am a big fan of almost any style of music and my taste is everywehre when comes to music.  This movie soundtrack as an added bonus of the movie lines thrown into the mixture of the songs.  Tarantino never seems to amaze me both with the music and his movies.  But back to the soundtrack I enjoy the good feel nature of the soundtrack and the tracks your able to sit back and enjoy almost all of them.  Their were a few tracks that I didn't enjoy personally but doesn't mean you won't enjoy them for yourself.  I will be looking into his other soundtracks when I get more free time.  So if you enjoy old school music and movie lines thrown into the mixture of the songs, then buy this CD and bring back memories or just sit back and relax to each track with a smile on your face.
B001KL3GZO|5.0|This masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. It's a radical break from everything going on at the time.
1469984202|5.0|I loved this book, and neglected large portions of my life in order to keep reading.  A thoughtful premise, well-developed and appealing characters, and a plot that kept me intrigued until the last page. I've read so much fiction over the years, it is hard to find a new perspective that isn't predictable or cliched.  Howie manages it. At the end of the Kindle version, Hugh Howie says he reads all his Amazon reviews, so here's a message to you, Mr. Howie:  Thank you for writing this.  I'm your newest fan and am telling everyone I know about you.  Now stop messing around here and go write some more!

B007SSEBCU|4.0|I am conflicted because Meryl Streep was fabulous but I hated her Margaret Thatcher's politics. Meryl Streep makes the movie worth watching.

B0086700CM|5.0|The kindle fire finally got temple run! I love this game so much! YEA!!!!!! This is the best free game ever!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The HBO series is a  favorite of my family. After the season is over, we watch the DVD to catch things we missed the first time. Trust me, you miss so many little details the first time. Always nice to go back and watch it again.
B000002BFY|5.0|Yeah, Yeah Totally agree with everyone, BUT.<br />What the heck about the FREAKIN' PACKAGE ?<br />UnBELIEVably COOL.<br />If you have never read the tiny details, please do.<br />We humans are SO F**d up.Creepy.<br />People used to believe this.<br />Thanks
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really is great.Had this app about 15 minutes and finished 3 puzzles. Downloaded<br />a couple of other groups and all worked great. Easy to navigate and the choices of<br />new puzzle groups to choose from is incredible. Would highly recommend this app<br />to all who like puzzles.
B0079KGAOY|3.0|i just wanna say that all Films in this set looks great on Blu-ray, but i really wish all of  these were the Director's cuts.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a really great game that I enjoyed playing. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who likes card games.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Excellent and easy read.  There are many twists and turns in this book.  Definitely a recommend if you like suspense.  The villains definitely take the plot to another level at the end.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My husband is a history buff. He loved the series on HBO, I bought it for him for Father's Day. He was very happy with my choice. A great addition to any family DVD library.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I'm ashamed of myself, the media, my government, and the humans of the world for not realizing this is happening. We will never be civilized if people anywhere are treated this way.
0439023513|3.0|I thought book 1 was strong, book 2 was great too but this one became a bit of a chore to be honest. I was really wanting to like it and tried my best but the first 3/4 of the book didn't grab me at all. The location of much of the book is underground and there was so much structure to every little thing that I felt really uncomfortable. I understand this may have been deliberate but I was also perplexed by the war plan details. There seemed to be no stable plan or not enough information given until you find yourself in the thick of it wondering 'what just happened and why?'. There were a few good conversations between characters but I was hoping for it to pick up pace earlier.<br />In a nutshell for the first 2/3 of the book, a lot went on but nothing happened.<br /><br />I also could not understand the obsession with food descriptions of every single meal and why it was so necessary to give Katniss a makeover for everything. I can understand it's a Capitol thing but what I don't understand is why Katniss never just put her foot down and made them stop by the third book of a trilogy where she was constantly made over.<br /><br />I think throughout the book, my interest was held by Gale and what Peeta would say next. I liked both characters for different reasons but Gale was my favourite and to me he always seemed the deeper match for Katniss.<br /><br />There were good and bad points to this book, and I thought the end was all good. Without giving spoilers, I was satisfied with the ending, both the action and the aftermath and the way grief and post traumatic stress was handled.<br />I wish I could have liked the entirety, but at least the end was enjoyable :)
B004I744AS|5.0|straight forward info. Lots of other neat added content beyond the dictionary. I like the word games and the additional info.
B006GHA9VQ|2.0|Pros,<br />Beautiful production, great sound, love the music, perfect floating, well directed, Kristine great voice, Phantom voice-acceptable,<br /><br />Cons, Very week story, not believable, should have been not related to the first Phantom at all. It destroyed the whole concept. That's why I had to block the first story out of my head completely, in order to enjoy the sequel. The acting was to mechanical for me. The best actors were Meg and the kid. Kristine was to young for her role she did not have any experience, in being a mother, wife and a lover. Phantom himself was to stiff and he is so far from Michael Crawford, like me to Michael Baryshnikov. I must have watched the first Phantom 5 times, 3 times with Crawford, and each time I watched I had chills in my spine. Even watching the movie, I had to wipe my eyes a few times. LND did not do anything for me, except a nice music. Some of the melodies repeat themselves over and over again Did ALW run out of the notes? He should have borrowed from Frank Wildhorn, he has a lot of them in his head. The ending of the story is absolutely stupid, and did not make any sense for me, besides it contradicts the original story. Kristina, who does she really love, besides her dresses? The story should have had a happy ending one, when Kristine helps the Phantom to be recognized as one of the best composers by beautifully performing his ballads. People could see the beauty in his music that would over shine his distorted face.<br /><br />I can go on and on about cons, but I will stop right there, because over all its pretty good show, just do not compare with the first one, if you do you will be disappointed.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. I've spent countless hours on these puzzles and they're all so fun. Would highly recommend. Plays well on the kindle fire.

0465068367|4.0|The title pretty much covers it.  This harrowing book tells the story of the Japanses conquest of the Chinese city of Nanking in late 1937.  Not for the faint of heart, Chang's story includes numerous detailed tales of rape, torture, and murder.  The handful of pictures in the book alone will turn your stomach.  The Japanese army's treatment of enemy soldiers and non-combatants rivals anything I have read on the Holocaust and the Eastern Front during the 1940's.  One of the most fascinating aspects of the story is that of John Rabe, a committed Nazi who, along with other westerners, made superhuman efforts to mitigate the damage being done to the city and its residents.  Chang's research appears thorough and she writes well.  My only quibble with the book is Chang's attempt to balance a historical account with a position piece on the lack of Japanese accountability after the war.  Chang's commentary on the latter is so heated that one cannot help wondering if the historical narrative is strictly objective.  That said, Chang is writing popular history, not a dissertation, and she succeeds admirably.  While reading the book I kept thinking how difficult it must have been for Chang to go through the source material.  I was thus saddened, but not shocked, to learn that she commmitted suicide a few years after this book was published.

B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Honestly, after Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and even Thor, I expected a lot more from this film. It felt draining and too long. Loki annoyed me as the villain but I get it. Honestly, it was just too long and I don't know if it was because I was just tired or it was just boring, but I had fallen asleep for about 10 minutes in the middle of it. I'll try to watch it again when the blu-ray comes out, and if I like it this time, I'll change my review. But at this point in time, not a big fan.<br /><br />Why I didn't give it 1 star, because I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo playing the Hulk. He did a phenomenal job. Also, who doesn't love Robery Downey Jr. playing Iron Man; entertaining as can be. Thor annoyed me in this movie, and Captain America was barely in it (Also one of the downfalls for me).<br /><br />Updated:<br />saw it again and honestly it wasn't that good still. I did notice Captain America more. The fighting scenes were okay. I guess the first time I was just really exhausted. All in all 3 stars should do it. Looking forward to the next Captain America film. Evans did this justice. Oh and Ruffalo was fantastic as well. Hope he is in the new Hulk film! Cheers.

B0042J6VUS|4.0|Anyone expecting a Gitzo quality tripod and mount for $3 shipped from Hong Kong should have their head examined for cracks.  On the other hand, if you purchase it with the idea that the clamp is a reasonable thing and the tripod is thrown in for giggles, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal.  Take care with it and use your brain and it should work for a season or two.  I think its a fine iPhone mount.
B004J00KJ8|5.0|This generally popular classic film is so well-known that further comment as regards its content is neither necessary nor relevant to this update review which relates specifically to the new Blu-ray edition. Whether or not the film is liked is not the point of the following upgrade comment.<br /><br />Although it is generally true that most Blu-rays offer extra image definition and sonics over the previous DVD version/s there is not always a huge difference achieved. This may simply be because the original DVD is so recent that most of the technical information is already encoded into the DVD. Sometimes the transfer to Blu-ray simply lacks due care to be worthwhile.<br /><br />However there are occasions where extra effort has apparently been made and where all the above provisos no longer apply. This is one such film. The improvement is quite remarkable with a tremendous improvement apparent throughout the process of restoration. In particular the DVD letterbox imaging has been replaced with full screen imaging and the soundtrack has far greater range. Both imaging and sound have greater definition than offered on the previous DVD.<br /><br />Provided that reasonable allowance is made for the age of the original film stock, it would be reasonable to expect most purchasers to be more than satisfied with this transfer to Blu-ray. In my opinion this improvement is a real 5 star achievement and the restoration team deserves success for their efforts.
0316154687|4.0|I've heard a lot about Sedaris but never read him and, to be honest, I was ready to dislike the book based on his stellar reputation alone. I mean, someone that popular cannot be any good, right? Alas, this is an excellent book, and Sedaris is a pleasure to read. Did I have hysterical fits of laughter? No. Did it rejuvenate my quest for the meaning of life? No. But it kept me company on some long flights across the country and I never set the book down in a bad mood. I suspect Sedaris can be more acerbic than this volume suggests and I look forward to reading his earlier works. I guess popularity does not always imply mediocrity. Oh, wait, Lady Gaga sold a thousand albums while I typed this.

B005LAIGP0|3.0|This movie had its moments. Tense. Moody. Creepy. Decent acting, a decent plot, a decent ending...but overall, this film was mediocre. For horror fans, it's worth a watch, but this film is like many of the cookie cutter horror films that have become the norm these days. I don't see myself adding \\"The Woman in Black\\" to my collection.
0743297334|4.0|This is my second Hemingway book of the past few months and I am very much a fan.  His writing is clear and the story never drags.  The book struck me as a \\"Seinfeld novel,\\" that is, an interesting story about nothing.  At the novel's beginning, Hemingway offers Gertrude Stein's famous statement about the \\"lost generation\\" of post-World War I Europe.  The characters in this story are definitely lost, or at least alcoholics.  Nearly every scene involves the consumption of a lot of alcohol; I was surprised any of the characters could stand, let alone relate Hemingway's crisp prose.  The Seinfeld comment aside, the novel centers on an American journalist who lives in France and travels to Spain with a group of friends.  All of the friends are damaged goods in various ways, but mostly they seem bored and heartbroken (not in the romantic sense of heartbreak, but the spiritual sense).  In the aftermath of the Great War they simply do not know how to comprehend life.  Careers, religion, and even love seem meaningless.  The people just exist -- and go to bullfights.  Indeed, the book is famous for Hemingway's vivid description of bullfighting in Spain; while the writing of these scenes is superb, I found myself cringing at the cruelty of the sport, which I suspect was not Hemingway's intention.  He would think I am being a weanie.  I am not sure I would widely recommend this book because of its somber tone, but if you're feeling a little lost and need something to relate to, give it a try.

B007PBL9KC|5.0|Man, I don't know what else to say about this album, except that it is REALLY good. I would say their sound is a mix between the folk of Mumford and Sons, the ensemble sound of Arcade Fire, and the uniqueness of Bon Iver. I've been listening to this album for about 3 days straight, which is two more than I give most albums these days.<br /><br />OMAM does a great job of putting together layered sound, both instrumental and vocal, along with some catchy lyrics and melodies, that make it tough to put down. Another reviewer said they sound like pop rock; I'd slightly disagree. They have a lot of the elements of pulling you in on choruses that Arcade Fire does on songs from \\"The Suburbs\\" or Mumford's debut album. You could call this pop rock, but I think it's pretty clear that they are very musically talented without really needing post-production to get them to shine. I'm sure they are as good live as they are in the studio.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best albums I've spun so far this year. I'm looking forward to taking this one on our family cross-country drive this summer.

0060853972|4.0|A collaborative effort on the part of two well-known fantasy authors, the book is intelligent, funny and a pleasure to read.  Pratchett and Gaiman have successfully written a parody of eschatology.  Yes, they are making fun of The End Times.  Given the book's audacious premise and numerous characters it is impossible to neatly summarize, but the plot is coherent and maintains a good rhythm.  Two characters stand out: the angel \\"Aziraphale\\" and the demon \\"Crowley.\\"  Rivals in the business of manipulating human conduct since the Garden of Eden, the two supernatural beings develop a friendship based upon their alternating amusement and disgust with human nature.  The dialogue between these two is often brilliant.  A minor criticism is the narrative sometimes slips from clever parody to sillines; a strong editor might have turned a very good book into a classic.  Still, the book rewards you with some laughs about the impending Apocalypse and subtle insight into the meaning of life.  If only the Bible could be that helpful to modern minds.

When I wasn't reading it (because I do need to earn a living) I found myself distractedly thinking about the characters like they were alive and living out their crazy lives while I was working.  I would have expected to pay a lot more for this book after having read it.  My only disappointment was that it ended too soon....a cleverly crafted plan Mr. Howey.  You will have plenty of followers willing to pay much more for the sequels, and the prequels!

B000005Z0E|5.0|This album is NOTHING like All Eyez on Me or any of Pac's later works. This album has no commercial appeal and is strictly for a real rap fan and a true 2pac fan.<br /><br />The social and political matters expressed throughout this album all have a strong delivery which makes you listen and appreciate Pac's views and believes. The old-school underground feel for me only adds to the greatness of this LP. here are my top 5 tracks from 2Pac's debut album:<br /><br />1. Brenda's Got a Baby (this is a top 10 2Pac track, and the message behind this song is strong and meaningful. Pac uses a fictional figure called Brenda and tells 'her story'. As the title of the track says, Brenda gets pregnant and has a baby at the age of 12, and like Pac says 'let me tell you how it effects our whole community'. A powerful song)<br /><br />2. Violent (a ridicuoulsy underrated Pac track. Great story telling about Pac and a friend taking on the police. Pac really shows his abilities and intelligence in this song)<br /><br />3. Trapped (a single from the LP. This is a very early 90s straight up olf-school hip-hop track. No techno beats with an R&B hook and a fake rapper spitting awful lyrics, just the greatest doing what he does best)<br /><br />4. Soulja's Story (an underground classic hit. A dark beat with violent lyrics make this a brilliant track and a highlight song from this LP)<br /><br />5. I Don't Give A F*** / If My Homie Calls (both tracks deserve to be in the top 5. These are both highlights and are great)<br /><br />Buy this album and listen to how Pac began as a solo rap artist!

0985114606|3.0|Initially I was furious with this book. Let me preface by saying I read 50 Shades & didn't think it was anything special. However, I was incredibly irritated & appalled at the shameless way this author copied 50 Shades. When I say copied, I mean COPIED. The storyline, yes very much the same, but literally there are multiple lines taken from 50 shades, I mean verbatim! That really got under my skin.<br /><br />Also, in the beginning the relationship progression between the two was inexplicably fast and didn't ring true. I get relationships are like that some times, love at first sight, infatuation or whatnot. But it didn't feel right.<br /><br />Despite this, I kept reading anyway & got hooked on them & very much emotionally connected to them, which is why I gave 3 stars rather than 2. In the end I really liked the story; they both were super intense & damaged & infatuated. (And as a therapist myself, I found the characters to be interesting regarding the road to recovery for so many of them)...(Another side note, I very much appreciate the authors subtle and seamless integration of diversity in this book; a job so well done I've never seen it happen before). Still, I remain annoyed and, quite frankly, disrespected at the authors blatant reproduction of the \\"hot new best seller\\" 50 Shades. Like I said: mixed feelings.<br /><br />If you haven't read 50 Shades, or devour romance novels quickly & won't mind an exact replication of something you've already read go for it. I will say the sex scenes are written a lot hotter than in 50 Shades. All in all I suppose I will read the sequel when it's released.

B0055SWM08|5.0|\\"Thinking Outside The Box\\" as the old cliche goes.  Although until now I've never seen a littoral example of the oft-used phrase.  Quell entices the player to consider options and movements in a totally unique way and disproves the adage, \\"The shortest route between two points is a straight line\\".  Through the clever use of switches, portals and traps, Quell presents a vast array of unique puzzle boards that are as complex to decipher as they are simple to behold.  Stimulate your mind while relaxing in the elegantly soothing puzzle-realm of Quell.
B0000039QA|5.0|In my opinion, to really understand Biggie and his style, you have to respect the hip-hop game. When i first got into rap, i liked the usual suspects such as 2Pac, Eazy, Snoop (back when he was worth listening too), Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan, but at first, i just couldn't get into Biggie's music. Once i developed a high IQ of knowledge in the hip-hop game was when i began to appreciate The Notorious BIG. This might just be me of course, but honestly, and i don't know why now looking back, but i first thought Big was overrated! Well, i was wrong, but as a kid, i wasn't all that fussed about Biggie.<br /><br />Years later, i purchased Ready to Die, his famous debut album. After hearing the third track on the album 'Gimme the Loot', i was hooked and never looked back. Once the final track on the album ended, i bought Life After Death. Besides 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, this was my favourite album from the later stages of the 1990s.<br /><br />This double disc LP has all the formula's to mix together to create a timeless classic. Now, onto the actual tracks on the album. Disc 1 is great and very consistant. Here are my top 5 tracks from the first disc:<br /><br />1. Somebody's Gotta Die (Along with 'Juicy', 'Gimme the Loot' and 'Who Shot Ya?', this is Biggie's greatest work in my opinion. The story-telling expressed in this track is stuff of legend, and this song sums up why BIG is one of the best to ever spit on a mic)<br /><br />2. Kick in the Door (a lyrical masterpeice track. Easily a top 5 or 6 Notorious BIG song. This is a real rap track. The skit at the begginning of the track which lasts little over a minute is entertaining and funny too)<br /><br />3. I Love The Dough (this features fellow rapper Jay-Z back in the day when he was worth listening too. A nice smooth beat works perfectly over the hard delivery of Big and Jay-z(<br /><br />4. I Got a Story To Tell (any track with Biggie telling a story always equals pure greatness. A great east-coast track)<br /><br />5. Hypnotize / Whats Beef? (i couldn't pick one without the other. Hypnotize is a great old-school party track and Whats Beef? is dark and grimmy. Really great and memorable songs)<br /><br />Disc 2 is equally as good, in some ways better. I find that Disc 2 hasn't got that great blow-off track which makes Disc 1 so brilliant, but Disc 2 seems to have all tracks being very good to great.<br /><br />1. Long Kiss Goodnight (a classic dark track by Big which is a forgotten hip-hop gem. Easily a top 10 Biggie song)<br /><br />2. Going Back to Cali (a song which has Big giving the west-coast props. A great party track which is another top 10 Big track, and also one of his more well-known tracks aswell)<br /><br />3. Notorious Thugs (a proper hip-hop track! This song features the great Bone Thugs N Harmony, and for anyone that knows of BTNH, you'll know the effort they put into their music, and in this track, they outshine Biggie and deliver some excellent high energy fast paced verses. Classic)<br /><br />4. Ten Crack Commandments (a forgotten classic track. The rhymes and flow hit hard here and is for the real rap fan)<br /><br />5. My Downfall (this features DMC, one of the three guys that started the hip-hop game with the hip-hop and rock trio Run Dmc. Two hip-hop all stars on a track together screams greatness, and this song acheived its hype)<br /><br />Overall, this album should be owned by any and all hip-hop fans!

0060853972|5.0|This may have been the only Terry Pratchett book left that I hadn't read.  So if the world ends today, I think I can die happy.  Also, avoid Lower Tadfield and anyone on motorcycles.<br /><br />As someone with a religious upbringing and a sacrilegious adulthood, Pratchett/Gaiman's take on end times demonology really hit the spot.  As per usual with Pratchett, he peppers his prose with wryly humorous descriptions of things.  His descriptions cut straight to the heart, peel it open, and reveal the charming absurdity inside.  My favorite line of the whole book is a good example: \\"It is a high and lonely destiny to be Chairman of the Lower Tadfield Residents' Association.\\"<br /><br />I've always loved the way Pratchett writes his child characters.  Their inexperience with the world allows them to plausibly alternate between astonishing nonsense and deep insight.  It's that back-and-forth between profundity and absurdity that has kept me reading Pratchett since I was a teenager.  I loved the decision to have an eleven year old Antichrist who would rather ride bikes and hang out with his friends by the river than unleash fiery doom on the world.<br /><br />Over the years, I've grown to expect wonderful things from anything with the Pratchett name on the cover.  This book does not disappoint.<br /><br />[Note to Neil Gaiman fans:  I haven't read much Gaiman, so I apologize if I seem to be ignoring his contribution to the book.  Imma get around to him!]

B004LROUW2|5.0|To be honest, I don't know how to approach reviewing a book like IQ84. I read other reviews of the book and many of them centered around Murakami as an author morethan the book itself.  The New York Times Magazine had a really good profile of Murakami some time ago. This book to me at its essence is a love story.  A love story between two people--Aomame and Tengo--who knew each other in grade school, were separated by the natural paths that life took, and then reunited after working hard to find each other. Their reunion in fact seemed a little too unbelievable in a city the size of Tokyo but to be fair this is a book that oftentimes takes you to the edge of credulity--two moons in the sky, little people emerging from a device made up of threads, hearing voices, pregnancies without sex, etc.  The book itself was actually written as three books originally by Murakami and I would say that the 2nd of the books is by far the fastest paced and most interesting. If you can stick with it and get past some of the believability issues, I think you will find this to be one of the best books you have read in years. I enjoyed it immensely.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Ha, that glitches with everything resetting time thing happened to me 3 times! Annoying, but you can use it for your advantage. 144 hours to collect items to cure a sick pioneer, it helps. The time reset thing doesn't effect buildings (or farm plots, animals, homes, businesses, etc.) that have finished production and just needs to be collected or have not started production yet like an empty farm plot. The way around it was I cycle my farm plots. I have a ton of lots and they are broken up into sections. First is an open unused section, another is a section ready for harvest, and the last is a section that is producing. When the glitches happened the other 2 times it didn't have that big of an impact. Also, I don't usually spend energy on collecting from the smaller homes so that saved my button. I would suggest multiple infirmaries (I have 10) and multiple workshops to make it easier to complete tasks. The waiting for 3 minutes for energy is annoying but do able. I HATE the constant spend real money crap! You will not beable to get everything because of that. Who the hell would actually spent $200 REAL DOLLARS anon something that will improve town's production 120%.Realistically, a huge waste of money. That is my biggest complaint. They really should have a way that you can produce the cash like the coins. Have buildings that cost coins (even if it's ultra expensive like 500,000 coins or something) that instead of producing coins pops out a few bucks here and there. The fact they want you to spend so much real money is absurd. The only other complaint I have is that there was a glitches that happened that everytime you would click on a settler to get a task the taste would pop up as you just completed it. It was nice getting the experience points and money for completing the task but the point of the game is to actually complete the task. Now, I've gone through 15 levels and still no more tasks, like I've completed all the task of the game. Hope they update soon. P.S. I got plenty of coins items what not, if you want to become a friend so you can get coins or other items I'm not sure how but look me up and I'll help out anyway I can..S.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I've waited since 2010 when Adam announced that he was working on this album, patiently weathered (verb) the moved released dates, and followed his headlines when ever I could. So when I finally got a hold of this second work of art by the American Idol alum, I decided to give one of my favorite music artist/entertainer the true benefit of the doubt. I was sold after my first thorough listen. I had read and re-read reviews by some music critics and made up my mind to ignore every single word they had the nerve to write. I say let Adam's fans be the true critics. Trespassing is everything I could hope/waited for and more. His own original work and collaborations with other artists is work of pure and resounding genius!!! Of course with any music cd I have my favorites and in this one, I love all of them. Adam really knows how to show his true self and speak to his fans through his music and I hope he continues to keep doing it. Can't wait for the next work of brilliance.

0061743526|5.0|It seems to me there is no better teacher in this life than fresh and honest simplicity. And where better to get a candid view of life - all its quirks, little joys, terrible meanness, and what is truly important - than through the eyes of an unworldly, but wise, child (Scout). But here lies the power in Harper Lee's mid-20th century story, To Kill a Mockingbird. In one sense it offers little more than some visits over a few years with Scout, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus - along with associated kinfolk, neighbors, and small town notables - but it gives to you the feeling that you haven't been alone in how and what you felt as a child, and what you knew and always will know was right and wrong; and the irreconcilable despair you felt and feel when you haven't much control over the bad things that happen.<br /><br />Scout's family is somewhat enigmatic; her mother has passed away, her father is a lawyer and elected state government representative, and she and her brother are both well read, intelligent, and sensitive. This lends some of the objectivity to the story as she witnesses and experiences ignorance and disdain for non-conformance. It also provides clarity and incisiveness in illuminating readers about the extent of discrimination - very pervasive and practiced during this time period - against the town's black people, and in particular, a black man accused of a crime who is being represented by Scout's father.<br /><br />Knocking around from her adventures in elementary school, summer playtimes in outdoors - where imagination was the roux of recipes for fun, excitement, and inevitably trouble - visits with neighbors, Q & A with her lawyer-father, her relationships with the townspeople, etc. - the perennially inquisitive Scout collects and analyzes information and tries to make sense of it all.<br /><br />Told through dialogue, observations, and reflections that embody the simple and mundane activities of day to day life in small-town Alabama during the depression, the story always seems lively and fresh with Scout's sense of humor, as she struggles to understand the world she lives in and the people who are part of it. The closeness, honesty, and love shared by her small family - always in their own way - warms you like a wood fire on a chilly night, and leaves you with a glow with which to remember it.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved the way it was written. I also really enjoyed the pictures that were included in the book. I also liked that it was very down to earth. It didn't have this big \\"end of the world\\" feel to it. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Jacob and Emma. I also liked that Jacob comes to the realization that he isn't crazy, but different and he embraces that. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a little bit of the peculiar.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever!:) it is very addictive. once you start playing you cant put it down. you should get!!! its worth it.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Bradley Cooper makes a decent fist of his role here, as the down and out writer struggling to find inspiration and motivation, who is introduced to a new pill.. this wonder pill allows the brain to access not just the 20% we use, but the whole brain - making him smarter, able to access every memory, and his abilities seem.. well, limitless.  Alas, this performance comes with a price.  The drug is not strictly legal, and he is not the only one who wants it.<br />It's a good hook, and broadly speaking the movie does a decent job of wringing a thriller out of it, and on the way makes some commentary on addiction - whether it is to drugs or to power or to consumerism - though unfortunately loses a lot of the bite as it progresses to an increasingly predictable thriller denouement.  Effects and editing are cleverly (if rather flashily) used to emphasise the heightened awareness, creating an oddly hallucinogenic mood as he transitions from down and out to super perceptive charmer and wheeler dealer.  In a supporting role Abbie Cornish does fine, and Robert de Niro shows up and says his lines in a throwaway role which seems almost perfunctorily added on.  Presumably he does just enough to get on the front cover to help sales, but it helps neither his career, or the film.<br />It's pretty exciting and relatively action packed, but with not too much violence.  All in all, any looming ridiculousness is staved off by a pace which doesn't allow you to think too much.  A shame perhaps, as with braver hands this might have been more of an interesting commentary rather than a thriller.. but it still works.  The directors name is Neil Burger.. perhaps if you consider the movie as cinematic fast food, it's a success.  It never felt like it had been put together by a masterchef, but it satisfied me at the time, reliably entertained me, even if I didn't remember much about it the next day.

B006R1T40I|5.0|Slipstream is a really good album.  Raitt's voice is unchanged and she still has that perfect mix of blues and rock n roll. I love it when artists like Raitt and Gregg Allman continue to create and keep coming back with new great recordings.  The album is a great mix of some upbeat and some serious songs.  I love that she did a few by Dylan, her voice is so perfect for his music.  On of my favorite songs on this CD is the last one -  \\"God Only Knows\\".  For those of you who did not see her on the 2012 Grammys perform the duet with Alica Keys in tribute to Etta James, you should check it out on you tube.  Proof that she can sing anything. It has been many years between albums for her, so I hope that the songs keep coming.

0062012339|5.0|This book has gone down somewhat into the folklore of the hard rock and metal worlds as something of a must read and it's easy to see why. The Dirt sees one of the most vacuous success stories of 80's hard rock excess laying their souls down in print, discussing their early years and the struggles they had in order to emerge, festooned with mascara, from the primordial ooze of the Sunset Strip of the early and mid 80's and then taking that story further by discussing the travails of their later career up until circa 2001 when it was originally copyrighted.<br /><br />Rather than give you some tasty and tasteless highlights of the stories that are set forth in this book I'll just point out a few things about it. Firstly the book seems to have been done in a collaborative spirit in that the various band members `own' chapters and this gives each a chance to speak their mind. As mentioned earlier these stories range from early years through to mid and later career thoughts and points. Interspersed with these band member chapters there are also chapters devoted to business partners, managers and the like and some of hte chapters are in the form of interviews done with various external figures. All of which makes the book feel very rich and authoritative.<br /><br />Secondly the way the book is set out allows it to feel like a breezy read. None of these guys is Shakespeare though they do like to talk and Neil Strauss really is to be congratulated for knocking this into shape so well given how much of the book must have been sourced from innumerable conversations by people whose memories are almost certainly.... hit and miss shall we say.<br /><br />In terms of production values the typeface is easy on the eye and the regular black and white photographs of not only the band but all the miscellany of tour programs, tickets etc do make the whole thing seem quite well thought out and informative. A picture speaks a thousand words as the clich&eacute; says.<br /><br />As we all know this book is not the final word in that the band continued to operate past the date of its release.  Whether this means we'll get an expanded edition at some point in the future is totally open to conjecture but whatever the case it's certain that few rock `warts `n' all' tales will equal this one for blunt honesty (and some dishonesty I'm guessing). An excellent gift for anyone you know into rock `n' roll excess, who enjoys loud and proud hard rock or the like and has the stomach for lots of debauchery and the sort of language usually reserved for naval folk.w this book is not the final word in that the band continued to operate past the date of its release.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not the game I remember as a kid. nice update on the classic game. works well on a kindle too
B006OKOZGU|5.0|This blu ray version of this classic movie is eye candy all the way through. It begins with several jewel robberies but then switches to Cary Grant's spectacular house in the hills behind Nice. The scenery is absolutely incredible. I have been there and that is a lot of the pleasure at seeing this beautiful place again. The cafe at the waterfront is on the steps going down to the yacht harbor at Monaco. That scene is no longer there as the steps were removed in a remodeling of the harbor. The winding road where Grace drives her Sunbeam Alpine at such high speed is the Corniche road where she was killed in a car accident years later. The movie is spectacular and one wishes to have been there at the time. They look like they are having a very good time shooting it and I certainly did have one watching it. From the picnic spot in the hills, one can see the casino at Monte Carlo in the distance and even the palace where Grace was to live out her life. Highly recommended.<br /><br />There may be a few spoil sports who don't know the story although other reviews cover that well. Grant plays a retired jewel thief from before the war who was paroled by the post war French government with the understanding that he abstain from theft. His companions during the war are also on parole, a situation threatened when someone takes up Robie's (Grant's) old practice. John Williams is a suitably whimsical insurance agent willing to go along with Robie's plan to catch the thief in the act. Grace Kelly is gorgeous as the daughter of a rich women who is an obvious target for the thief. When an another man is killed, she realizes her error in accusing Robie and becomes an assistant, as does Williams the insurance man. The scenery is still the star and the chief reason to see the movie.<br /><br />Watch it for the scenery, not the plot.

0553801473|2.0|Having just finished A Dance with Dragons which is Book five in the Fire and Ice series by George R. R. Martin, it occurs to me how the series will end in the planned seventh book: there will be only two characters still alive (sort of) who will alternately capture and torture the other, the imprisoned one will escape over countless miles and misfortunes, but being so tormented he/she will change their name and plot how to imprison the other.  Then the former oppressing character will be captured by the former prisoner (only after killing any remaining peasants along the way), will take sexual advantage of the other, will have various body parts removed or mutilated, and generally debase the other as completely as possible.  Great fodder for an HBO mini-series.  The final scene will probably involve cannibalism (yet again) and some will read to that final scene to see who gets in the last bite.  Not me.  I began enjoying the author's writing in the early books and his excellent character development, but the repeated attempt at cliff hanging endings to chapters, constant pointless wars that decimated the countryside, bizarre story twists, killing off most characters, debasing of all the people and characters, and weak storytelling lead me to keep drudgingly reading in hope that the story would come together and some theme or coherent story lines would emerge.  Alas, this has not and likely will not happen.  Read on in morbid curiousity, if you must, but I quit the series right here.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This app does not work on my tablet. I have a cruz t301 tablet and this app will not work.
0345803485|3.0|I did enjoy this book to a certain extent (good subject matter), but I didn't think it was as well written as its reputation would make you believe.
B0086700CM|4.0|I had this game on my iphone and had been waiting for it to come to the kindle.  Very enjoyable!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How this is a best seller, I'll never know. 50 shades of grey is genuinely an awful book. The plot is uninteresting and drags quite a bit.  It seems like it was written by a 14-year-old girl. Redundant phrases, pretentious, ridiculous descriptions. I lost count on how many times she said \\"holy crap!\\" or \\"oh my\\" or \\"I flushed\\". The sex scenes were so awful I couldn't even get turned on by them I was laughing too hard.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game I would have to rate as the most addictive game ever I start to play then I just can't stop playing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its not the best at first Cuz most of the boring games are there before u buy any new games but once u start buying more games it gets better and fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun for anyone of any age. especially when your bored. it would be fun for kids and adults
B007JM4CWY|5.0|II'm so addicted to this game, it's not even funny! I'm so happy I got it. It's well thought out, and more functional than other games of the same kind. I love how you are able to mark what boxes for sure can't be used, I can't find that on any other game.. Seriously, this eill keep you entertained anf thinking for hours!
B000SEJHRA|4.0|The tip of the roots of Sedaris's witty, crafted writing. I'm an avid fan of his work and Engulfed in Flames is still his best.  At least it is for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun! I think it would be even MORE awesome, though, if we were able to customize our own individual runners. Like be able to buy different clothes and shoes and change hair color and body types! Just my opinion!
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|I'm not a power user of Plex, but I'm glad I can access much of my Mac-based media on my Samsung Verizon Fascinate, without hooking up via USB or doubletwist.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this. my favorites are now on my kindle fire! thank you amazon! love it! I give it five stars!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Just writing to say that this is an excellent inspiring movie.  When she quotes Job 39:19-24, that is enough to make you WANT to watch the movie.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This is a fun one, for a while. You definitely need a dry wit to enjoy the characters' jokes. Use it on a Samsung Verizon Fascinate, no problems running it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game the ads are a little annoying but I only get an ad between games so they aren't too annoying
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I like this app I have played on my freinds ipod. but its just to expensive you need to have a sale
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really love this app.  The SEARCH feature is my favorite, if I cannot remember the location of a verse I simply type in a couple of words and there's a list of references. I only wish that I could get the Strong's definitions inside the app: that would make it 5 stars.

0439023513|5.0|I just read Mockingjay for the second time.  The first time read it within 48 hours, and I was left wanting more and unsure of the ending, so I needed to go through it again slower and really take it all in.  I loved it; it was the perfect ending.  I highly recommend this trilogy, it pulls you in!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Simple and fun. Could use a little more explanations on some of the games, but they are not too hard to figure out.
B0086700CM|5.0|A very addictive game that I have always wanted to get thisvgame and when it came to the kindle it was awesome.
0783233477|4.0|Not a big fan of Brad Pitt, too much of a signature, but have always like Anthony Hopkins. Well acted and convincing. I actually cared about the characters and there were a few interesting character studies with the older daughter and her relationship with the younger daughter who was the apple of her daddy's eye. I really found myself hoping the youngest daughter would get together with the angel of death.<br />Hopkins, as usual, was very believable as the successful, caring entrepenure.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|This one will give you everything you expect from a Wallberg film.  It is worth the rental.  While there may be some forgiveness of the script and story for not being watertight, it is a really good action film.
B00005U122|5.0|Excellent stage show, well filmed, updated versions of the songs, including sound quality. Probably better than seeing it live because you are front stage.  Well worth the purchase price, and you can't see Roger Waters live for $10!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lep's World reminds me of Mario! Controls are easy for all ages. It can be very addicting just like any other game!
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I was worried after seeing all the low rated reviews but really enjoyed the movie.  Good action, characters I cared about, good to know that the actress is a real-life hard ass.  See it!
B001EYU1VO|4.0|Bought from a local retailer for 10 dollars more than the Amazon price.<br /><br />Had two other Saiteks in past years an original Cyborg which I have always regretted giving away and the original AV8R which I still have.<br />Thought I'd give this thing a go for FSX and ended up liking its features.<br /><br />The folding base turned out to be a great benefit for me because I can actually rest this stick in my lap for comfortable flying.<br />The tiny thumb-wheel between buttons 2 and 3 works so great for aircraft trim.<br />This feature really helps me fly so much better.<br /><br />The button placement is OK for simming no cons or pros there.<br />I don't have to fumble as much for basic flying with the buttons.<br />Buttons 10 and 11 are in a weird place being on the left front under the throttle slider.<br />This ended up being a good thing because if you have need for something like a throttle cut-off that's a good out of the way spot.<br /><br />The adjustments on the stick are in some cases good.<br />I shortened mine even though having larger hands.<br />Gives a compact feel in hand.<br /><br />The 2 piece design could be good for some.<br />I'll just leave mine alone no need to take it apart for storage.<br /><br />Seems like the rudder axis is tight and slightly glitchy.<br />I'll have to fiddle with the dead zone adjustment.<br />Maybe widen it a touch.<br /><br />The Saiteks have always been somewhat stiff.<br />I really don't like the firmness so I just apply silicone or petroleum jelly under the sticks centering collar.<br />Not a cure just seems to smooth the movement some.<br /><br />Hope these impressions help.<br />I recommend this joystick for basic flightsim use.
1451626657|4.0|A clever mix of \\"alice in wonderland\\" kind of dialogues in a \\"apocalypse now\\" scenery. A rich cast of unlikely characters, full of bizarre idiosyncrasies, blurs the border between reality and fantasy, and makes you ponder about the absurd double-binds of our \\"normal\\" lives. The very non-linear narrative ties together a long list of episodes, loosely revolving are the main character, Yossarian.<br /><br />Some parts were truly great (I loved Milo's character and syndicate), but at times the it seemed to try too hard to be clever and witty.
B0086700CM|4.0|it sometimes gliches on a kindle......but I still like it because it never stops completley...its a big time waster....best game I have
B0086700CM|4.0|There needs to be more stuff to buy and some more objectives in the game. But otherwise the game is a blast of fun!

0451232577|4.0|In a small Welsh town of Aberowen, a 13 year old boy, Billy Williams, enters the dark pits of the world of coal mining. His sister, Ethel, is a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts and makes the mistake of falling in love with Earl Fitzherbert, who is already married to Princess Bea of Russia. The Earl's sister, Lady Maud Fitzherbert, crosses into forbidden territory when she falls in love with a German diplomat. Two orphaned Russian brothers, Grigori and Lev Peshkov, dream of leaving Russia to emigrate to America but fate and the war affect their plans. And finally, the over-privileged American diplomat, Gus Dewar, who serves as an aide to Woodrow Wilson, plays his part in drawing America into the war.<br />The reader is taken into a riveting story that weaves together the lives of the main characters with each other and with real historical characters. As the story unwinds, so does the war.  The time period is well researched and serves as an informative history lesson on coal mining, trade unions, women's rights, attitudes of the aristocracy, politics, revolution and of course, the events that led up to the First World War.<br />I really like Ken Follett's development of characters, and I noticed this in Pillars of the Earth also. He portrays their motivations in such a way that the reader develops an ambivalent understanding for even the most unsympathetic characters, such as Lev Peshkov or the Earl.  None of the characters is perfect, and none are completely bad either. They all have their strengths and flaws that make them undeniably human and thus, relatable.<br />This is another magnificent, epic novel of historical fiction that I thoroughly enjoyed. A hefty book at 1000 pages, it would be easier to download on your slim kindle or ipad. Book two of the Century  trilogy is called Winter of the World...but I have not read it as yet. Enjoy!
1594200653|3.0|Tony Judt's Postwar deserves the praise it gets. But why no sources?<br />That absence is a grave defect. No bibliography, no essay on archival<br />sources, no notes to documents.  We have to take it all on trust and<br />Judt's reputation. That it's meant for a popular audience is no excuse.<br />I just finished Timothy Snyder's Bloodlands,<br />also good for a popular audience, and it is fully documented.
B00324AS3K|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a novel set in a cafe in the middle of Lahore and is in a monologue form between an American tourist and a Pakistani man. The story is told by the Pakistani man named Chengaz about his time in America as a student, his first job, and his love interest with a woman named Erica. Though the story focuses on Erica, and his job, he also talks about how he was racially profiled after the events of 9/11. After that happened he talked to a man in South America where he learnt more about himself and his identity as a Pakistani man. At that point he decides to accept his Pakistani side and slowly reject the American culture that he has been exposed to. But because of that, the consequences are that people don't accept him anymore and the company he works for had to fire him and then he went back to Pakistan with his family.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because it gave me great insight to both the \\"American Dream\\" idea of many foreigners and also insight about Pakistani people and their Islamic faith. I recommend this book to anyone who would want to learn more about the Islamic faith and also to have a insight on how people after the 9/11 incident.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I bought this book, I thought that it would be a lot of blah! However, the title intrigued me, and I bought it on the Kindle. It has been well formatted on the Kindle.<br /><br />It took me one or two attempts before I read the book through, but at the end I was hooked. While not in the same powerful genre of a \\"1984\\", this book does manage to capture the de-humanizing effect of a sort of all seeing power situation, and the effect of war games on children. Since the book has been written in the first person, I knew that the heroine would not die, and that she would survive. However, the almost deadpan style of writing is effective in showing how kids can be completely dehumanized by war. It makes you think of children who are put into this situation in Africa, East Europe, Afghanisatan....<br /><br />I am not sure why some book stores classify this as a children's book. It goes much deeper than that.

B00000JNOJ|5.0|I first heard this CD about 2 months ago, when my boyfriend came to visit and brought it with him. He said he thought I might like it. Within just the first few notes, I was hooked. Grabbed the CD case and ran over to the computer, logged onto amazon.com to order my own copy before the first track was finished. This CD is now on my Top 10 list. This is an album of BLUES, no messin' around. This is the real deal. Muddy Waters brings the blues up from his toes to the top of his head. His voice was made for the blues. And my ears were made for hearin' 'em. The best music on earth. Sheer perfection.<br /><br />If you're so inclined, check out the DVD called Cadillac Records, and see how it all started.<br /><br />Muddy's the Man. Oh, yeah.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book ends the trilogy well, and goes deeper into the theme of manipulation and power. Even though she is the \\"mockingjay\\", and the symbol of resistance, she is never the real symbol. She is consistently manipulated, even by her childhood friend. EVerything is to be subdued in the name of the cause, and in the name of those in power.<br />Her final act, when she kills the new president, is a powerful indictment of those in power. Revolution never really builds a new future for the masses. It builds a new future for those who lead the revolution.<br /><br />The final climatic scene where she looks into the eyes of Snow, before firing her arrow is a fitting end to the trilogy indeed.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The item arrived as adverised.Still one of the funniest shows ever. Some of the later episodes were a little lame but not too many. The only negataive thing is that somewhere in the third or fourth season they changed the music from Sinatra to some junky instramental. I don't remember this on the reruns so it must be something with the music industry, who also are making it impossible to have more seasons of WKRP!
B002KS1IJC|1.0|It looked good on paper:  Jim Caviezel, John Hurt, and a cool sci-fi concept, but lordie, it's bad.  Bad bad bad.  Writing is bad.  Acting is bad.  Makeup is bad.  No reason to continue watching after 42 minutes.
0307959856|3.0|This book falls between good Austen and good P.D. James--it has neither the depth of the Austen characters it appropriates nor the crackling excitement of a good James mystery. It focuses on the characters of the wild and feckless young Bennet sister and George Wickham, the swashbuckling cad she eloped with, who was paid to marry her. Wickham's friend is murdered and Wickham is accused; the resulting trial causes consternation among the rest of the Austen characters and of course there is a surprise ending.<br /><br />The long discussion of events in Pride and Prejudice at the end is confusing to those who have not read or have mostly forgotten this novel, and annoying to those familiar with it. On the other hand, if you just want a slow-moving cozy set in the early 19th century, this book may be for you.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a good sequel to the first book. I like the symbolism of the robes that catch fire, I liked the way that Suzanne Collins introduced Mr Snow, however, I am not sure of the sybmolism of the rose, unless it is to emphasize the contrast between the white of his clothes and the blood red colour of the rose. It continues in the same vein as the first, however, there is much stronger emphasis on the whole element of manipulation of the masses by the powerful elite.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|In the afterword of Stephen King's remarkable \\"11/22/63,\\" King credits the late Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" as the greatest time-travel story.  With all due respect to King's humility, not since H.G. Well's classic \\"The Time Machine\\" has this popular but tired topic been handled with as much creativity - and purpose - as this in-depth examination of Lee Harvey Oswald and the JFK assassination.<br /><br />Lewiston, Maine diner owner Al Templeton has stumbled upon a time portal in the pantry of his aging stainless steel diner.  Unlike many stories involving the science fiction of time travel, in this one the traveler has no control: a journey through the back of Al's Diner always ends at the same point:  September 9, 1958.  Templeton reasons that there is a short list of events that have had major impact on world history - the Kennedy assassination one of them.  So investing the five plus years in the past between 1958 to that fateful day in Dallas in 1963 to determine if Oswald really was working alone, and if so, to stop him, would be well worth the sacrifice.  But Templeton finds that the past is obdurate - it resists being changed.  So before completing his quest, he is stricken with terminal cancer, and it becomes very clear to him that Al will die before being able to complete the mission of his accidental journey.  Enter Jake Epping, English teacher at the local high school and casual friend of Al's.  Armed with Al's crazy story and his detailed notes, he steps - literally - through the pantry and back into 1958, just as Al described, and assumes the role of history-changer.  What follows is a rich and unexpected mix of nostalgia, history, love, and mystery, all wrapped in King's unparalleled knack for detail, subtle foreshadow, and suspense.  The imagery is superb: \\"Cocked on the back of his head was a filthy fedora that looked straight out of a 1950's film noir, the kind where all the women have big bazonkas and all the men talk fast around the cigarettes stuck in the corners of their mouths.\\" And as in much of King's work, inanimate objects take on sinister qualities: in this case, it is the past which proves to be a worthy, daunting, and malevolent adversary.<br /><br />I've observed that readers of fiction fall into two general categories - those who love Stephen King and those who can't tolerate him.  As I see it, \\"11/22/63\\" bridges these two groups; a fascinating blend of rich history and clever fiction that, while lacking the horror and terror expected from King, provides twists and turns and enough mystique to make this unmistakably Stephen King.  And strangely, this is also a love story; a tale complicated by the paradox of time; a sensitive treatment that avoids being maudlin while delivering a knockout blow as powerful and poignant as you'll ever read from accomplished authors known more for romance than terror.<br /><br />In short, \\"11/22/63\\" may be Stephen King's most important work; the culmination of over four decades of writing - an ambitious but superbly executed epic that dares to cross genres and succeeds on all fronts.  Whether you are a fan of historical fiction, science fiction, drama, suspense - or Stephen King - this is simply a novel you can't afford to miss.stuck in the corners of their mouths.\\" And as in much of King's work, inanimate objects take on sinister qualities: in this case, it is the past which proves to be a worthy, daunting, and malevolent adversary.<br /><br />I've observed that readers of fiction fall into two general categories - those who love Stephen King and those who can't tolerate him.

0062020897|5.0|\\"Eye of the Needle\\" is absolutely five star material.<br />I had a great week of reading, going back and forth with this and Dean Koontz's \\"Whispers\\".  Oddly enough, these two books are what sparked the career's of two of my favorite writers.<br />I'll admit I was a little wary of reading a new Follet book, reason being that I have read and LOVED all of his historical fictions.  The rest of his books, although there is a historical aspect, are mainly spy/thriller type books.  So I wasn't quite sure how I'd respond to them.<br />I decided to start with what seems like many fans regard as the best, \\"Eye of the Needle\\".  Let me just say that in UNDER ten pages, I was totally hooked on this book.  Something that I did not see coming happens right in the beginning, which blew my mind immediately.  From the opening pages through the conclusion, everything that makes a great thriller is there.  Twists and turns, great dialogue, and one hell of an action-packed ride throughout.<br />I loved the balance between the different viewpoints of the main characters.  You have \\"Die Nadle\\", who is a German spy, and then you have Godliman and Boggs, two of Britians men trying their hardest to catch him.  The chapters from the spy's viewpoint are fast-paced, while the chapters written about the people tracking him are more informative, although still somewhat fast-paced.  It is a joy to watch them put all of the clues together, hoping to catch \\"Die Nadle\\", and likewise it is a joy to watch the spy cunningly stay one step ahead.  This is a book that is very difficult to put down.<br />More than that, it is such a privilege to be a fan of Follet's.  I consider \\"Pillars/Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\" to be at the very top of my list as best books i've ever read, and honestly, \\"Eye of the Needle\\" comes extremely close to matching them.<br />Another superb book by Follet, and as a fan I'm extremely satisfied.  5 out of 5 for sure...and I can't wait to read more from him.

0375758992|5.0|Today, I came across a critical review in an esteemed journal, wherein the author emoted that whereas Alexandra Fuller pleads that she and her parents don't go to the dogs tonight, it would be better if they did.<br /><br />For each historical era there have been a group of people whom it is considered politically fashionable to hate. I sometimes sense a resounding cry of \\"leave the others alone, and hate only these ones!\\" In the mid 20th Century is was okay to hate the Jews, if you were alive in Europe at that time. Blacks have often been hated -- especially in the American 20th Century. Women are still regarded as sub-human in myriads of cultural and social contexts.<br /><br />In Rhodesia, and more so the Republic of South Africa, one wouldn't have wished to be born black in the 20th Century. The contemporary state of Zimbabwe is not much kinder, economically or politically, to the average person who has been born black.  Still, there is a spirit of freedom in the air that was not there before.  People are happier, lighter, and act in a more harmonious way with their surroundings, compared to what I had observed during the colonial era.<br /><br />Such wonderful change comes at a price.  I lost my identity when my family emigrated.  (I was fifteen.)I didn't know where to begin, so I tried various things. Experiments. One of these was to embrace fundamentalist Christianity. It made me increasingly sick. Sick to the heart. Sick to the bone. I tried to recapture the possibility for adventure I had earlier enjoyed in my life. That seemed to work up to a point, but something was still wrong.<br /><br />I didn't resolve the issue until I wrote my PhD thesis on a Zimbabwean writer and the traumas he faced, due to racialism and war.  Since I was also traumatized by my post-emigration experiences by this point, I found Dambudzo Marechera's writing  cathartic.<br /><br />Fuller's writing captures the life of real people, many of whom, like Fuller's mother, were traumatized by life.  She details the magic of the Rhodesian experience, which involved transcending the immediacy of one's personal traumas and finding pleasure even in the midst of hardship.by life.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Once upon the time, there was a little kitten left at the doors of an orphanage.  His name was Puss. You will have to watch this wonderful animated movie to find out how can such cute little creature turn out to be such a bad little kitty....<br /><br />I absolutely adore this movie.  It is great for both adults and kids.  One does not have to be a cat lover to fall in love with this kitty cat character so adorably played by Antonio Banderas.  In the story, Puss meets his match.  Her name is Kitty Puff and she is a female Zoro (played by Salma Hayek).  This animated film is very original.  It has wonderful moments such as Puss in the bar when he orders a shot of \\"leche\\". The way he drinks it will drive you mad!  Not to mention dancing duel between Puss and Kitty when she pulls a \\"kitty litter\\" dance move on him. I loved this film from start to finish.  It is one of the best animated movies ever.<br /><br />I still cannot get it out of my head when Antonio Banderas at the end of the movie says how Puss is a 'great, great lover\\" and \\"seducer of beautiful women\\".  With his hard rolling \\"r\\"s and spanish accent, this figure of speach will be a kind of thing that will make you smile every time you think of it.  Enjoy!
B007OXWWX4|4.0|First things first: spring for the Deluxe Edition. The 2 \\"bonus\\" tracks are songs that feel like they should be on the regular album anyway, and with them included the album clocks in at 61:27 (an hour is basically my ideal time a record should last). The \\"behind the scenes\\" DVD (which has a close up of the angel/demon/guitar cover art on the disc - it looks SWEET!) is only about half an hour long, but being a musician myself, I can't help but love it. Slash & the guys talk about various aspects of the record and working as a band (only a few songs are discussed at any length), but the best part is watching them play/practice, which is done throughout the 30 or so minutes. While watching Slash play a concert is incredible, watching him rehearse is equally awesome. It just is. The booklet has NO LYRICS, which some people don't care about, but I'm a lyricist as well as a guitarist so it does irk me a little. Myles isn't always the easiest singer to try to decipher, ya know?<br /><br />Also, it comes with a coupon that's redeemable online for a free T-Shirt (which, judging by the picture on the coupon, is a white shirt with the album cover on the front in black & white. I personally think it's cool that it's not in color, 'cause I'm sure you'll be able to buy that anywhere), but you will have to pay shipping. I'm in Cali, so it was about $5. Still a great bonus, especially for the price of the total package. It expires 5/21/2013, just so you know.<br /><br />Now as for the tunes themselves, it really is Slash's best work since the original Snakepit. Yeah, better than the last album (which was too diverse for my tastes, though the guitar work was amazing as usual), better than VR, better than Snakepit 2000. And I don't mean just guitar work, I mean the songs themselves are better. Bold statement, I know. My favorite is \\"Hard & Fast\\", which I'm actually listening to as I type. Easily the most rockin' song, it feels like Chuck Berry on speed during a pornstar gangbang while driving 100 mph in traffic. I don't know how else to describe it. My least favorite, though I don't hate it by any stretch, is the next track (which I'm now listening to as I type) \\"Far And Away\\". The only real ballad on the album, it certainly stands out and is kind of an awkward slowdown from the rest of it. Admittedly, I love the phrasing of the solo, as is the case with basically all these songs. Slash is going out of his way to not only not copy himself too much (I say \\"too much\\" because a little here & there is inevitable) but to raise his own personal bar, and it shows. Great riffs, great solos, great songs. That's really all you need to know.<br /><br />On a personal note, it's a shame that Axl bailed on the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame induction ceremony, because now it's confirmed that there will never, ever be a GN'R reunion, and as I listen to this record (for the third time now & it just arrived today) I can't help but think that these songs would be so much better coming out of Axl. But it's probably better to not make the comparison, so forget I said anything.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars. Great Rock N'F'N Roll album & made even better by the timing of it's release because this feels like an ideal summertime record! Buy this as soon as you can afford it, and if you don't love it then don't claim to love rock n' roll. Straight up.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Indeed, Snow White meets the Grimm in the film version out in theaters this last Friday. I love the concept of giving Snow much more to do than lay in a coma waiting for her Prince. When she awoke after the Huntsman's kiss, it seemed that she left the fairies and fantasies behind to pick up a sword to fight the good fight...a decision not made in the fanciful tales we grew up with. Kristen Stewart is worthy of leading a film. I'll buy a copy for my DVD library to go along with the Twilight Saga when it is available.

1451627289|3.0|I found 11/22/63 very enjoyable to read, but difficult in equal measure to swallow.<br /><br />It wasn't because of the writing, as I like the way King weaves a story, and I've read most of his books over the years and have always enjoyed them, especially this one being such an  endearing love story.  It wasn't because of the mechanics of time travel, as the conundrums time travel creates presents endlessly layered plot shifts to happily mess with our time-limited environment.<br /><br />What I did have difficulty with was King's premise regarding the killing of John F. Kennedy. 70-80% of Americans believe that JFK was killed by a conspiracy. The House Sub-Committee on Assassinations in 1979 concluded as much. A simple observation of the Zapruder film shows that the Single Bullet Theory, the tortured assumption that one bullet caused the injuries to both JFK and Governor Connally, is easily disproved. A bullet traveling at ~2000 fps did not linger in the air for almost 2 seconds waiting for the governor to assume the correct position to be injured. It did not crush and mangle bones in the Govenor's chest and wrist and then emerge in pristine condition. The SB Theory is the linchpin of the Warren Commission.  When shown that more than one bullet caused the injuries to these two men, its findings disintegrate. Occam's razor demands the simplest explanation based on the facts-more than one bullet for those injuries, more than one shooter caused them. Even Governor Connally and his wife Nellie, sitting beside him in the limousine that sunny Dallas morning, always disagreed with the Single Bullet Theory (aka Magic Bullet Theory).<br /><br />It was therefore hard to read the aspects of King's book based on the conventional myth presented by the Warren Commission--that Oswald alone killed JFK. And it is too important an issue to let slide as the continued lie slowly leaves people numbed to the truth--our president was killed by our own. An American coup d'etat.<br /><br />It does not matter what sort of screw-up Oswald was if the laws of physics and common sense show that there was more to the killing of JFK than a lone gunman. Another book, [[ASIN:0982906404 The Memoirs of John F. Kennedy: A Novel]], covers similar ground as 11/22/63. Released a year before, it comes at the subject from a more nuanced approach than the \\"Oswald did it\\" crowd and shows what might have happened had JFK survived the assassination attempt and gone on to a second term. What might have occurred had his real killers and their motives been exposed. The book has won numerous awards. I am the author. I am not a wild-eyed conspiracist. My comments here can be taken as self-promotion, as it is true that I desire more people to read my book. But more importantly, a more vigorous reckoning with the facts is needed.<br /><br />We Americans want to believe in our government. We want to believe we act morally and follow our best angels. But there are times when we must look behind the curtain and see our dark side. Attributing the death of JFK to Lee Oswald as a lone and independent sociopath is a convenient means of avoiding the hard truths behind the assassination. 50% of the American people disbelieved the findings of the Warren Commission when it was released in 1964. That number has only grown as more information and independent investigations have chipped away at the mis-information presented by that supposed Blue Ribbon panel. Extending the myth via this otherwise intriguing book by Stephen King is unfortunate.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Until less than a month ago, I hadn't heard of this book. A friend told me over lunch one day, and it seemed like after that I was hearing about it several times a day - on talk shows, news shows, conversations at work. I had to read it. Couldn't get it at my local library so I purchased it. I've been at a loss ever since about why it has sold the way it has. It's not a horrible book, unless you are opposed to reading borderline porn. It is well-written. But it wasn't a book I couldn't put down. And it was far from the best book I've ever read. And I've read books on my Kindle that were only 99 cents and were at least as good. Maybe the time was right for putting out a book that read like several x-rated movies page after page. And I kept thinking - no wonder the world is so messed up, if basically good people like Ana could be sucked into a love affair with someone like Grey and actually expect it to turn out better than it did.
0345803485|3.0|I have read all three books, because I thought perhaps once I read them all I would get a better perspective on the story as a whole.<br />All I have to say is where is the meat in this book?  There was very little of a story line in this book.  I get how Ana brought Christian<br />around in her own way, but I too do not understand the whole repetitive sex scenes and the I hate you one second I love you the next. It got<br />tiring after the first half of the book.  I think if she had not been so repetitive and perhaps had some major life crisis in the book it would have been<br />a bit better.  Every time something happened to Ana it would be about a page worth of story then suddenly Christian would come to her rescue.  I think<br />Ana was boring and needed to have more of a traumatic contrasting experience to make this story more meaty for the lack of a better word.  This book could<br />have had a lot of potential alas it did not.

0345803485|1.0|I don't normally bother writing reviews but in this case, I thought it was necessary. This book lacked creativity in every sense of the word. Ana gets a handsome, rich, successful man to fall head over heels in love with her. To make it more absurd, he satisfies her EACH and EVERY time they have sex... oh please! The plot in this book was no better than the Sweet Valley High books I use to read as a kid. Except, now, I am a grown woman and my time is much more valuable so I don't appreciate wasting it on garbage like this. If I could advise the author, I would tell her to keep the sexual material (that was actually fascinating) but scrap the plot and characters. Give us a woman we can relate to and put her in a more realistic situation. Not many of us woman come out of college to find a handsome rich guy that buys us an Audi and anything else our lil heart desires.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's account of her pilgrimage along the Pacific Crest Trail is the story of a woman finding herself in both the misery and triumphs of day to day moments unfolding in her journey.  Reading her words, I felt the intimacy of finding a new friend, who wrote like she was speaking to me from across a kitchen table.  I understood her devastation at losing her mother, and recognized the confusion and indigestion that often result from trying to digest one's future, all in a lump.  Rather, she offers things as they are, truly surrendering to all the feelings and sensations of each step along her hike.  Her quest is to get through each day, in spite of the heavy pack on her back, her blackened toe nails and often extreme discomfort.  She becomes the observer of herself and her stories, watching herself with humor, insight and growing compassion.<br /><br />I imagine that there will be many many more hikers hitting the trails after reading Strayed's story, but even for those who don't test themselves in the wilderness, there is still much to be learned just by living each day on the edge, Strayed-style.  We are all capable of listening to the stories we tell ourselves, and gently reshaping our experiences through finding the survivor, the savorer of experiences, the hero, who waits beyond the surface of our life stories.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock: Season Two is nothing short of spectacular. It is just as good as the first season and I'm sure the following seasons will be just as enticing. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman deliver an amazing performance. There are two DVD's one with the first two episodes and the second with the last all episodes have an optional commentary as well. Praise BBC.
B0086700CM|4.0|creative and entertaining ... wish the game was not so commercial because you have the option to buy tokens to spend.  other than that it is a great game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Outstanding fantasy book. To criticize the book or writing means you are taking it too seriously. It's fiction...not nonfiction. Lighten up and go enjoy life. This book provided a temporary fantasy for entertainment purposes only and it was successful at that. Excellent book if you are not uptight and understand the difference between real life and fiction. Go buy it!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the mini games.  It's a good way to pass time.  You can get instructions for each game before playing, contrary.to what other reviews say.  For what it is, I enjoy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting along time for this game! Even better on Kindle fire than on iPod or a phone!!
B007JM4CWY|3.0|This is a delightful puzzle game (a bit like Minesweeper mated with a crossword puzzle), but after the first few puzzles the matrices become too large to work with on a phone. You must very precisely tap a square to mark it, and they are just too small on a cell phone screen. On a tablet, I suspect the problem would be considerably lessened, though some of the larger puzzles might have the same problem on a 7 or 8 inch tablet. An iPad or similar 10 inch Android is really the ideal medium for this game.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The game is great, if you like griddlers (or any of the dozen other names used for these puzzles). The images are nicely done and the hold-and-swipe is very helpful...theoretically. Actually it's often faster to tap each square than to swipe a row, swipe again to x out the wrong row, swipe again to blank it, again to get the right row, tap the last couple that you missed...

B007SYWFRM|2.0|At first ice age village is a lot of fun. I am a fan of this type of game, having spent countless hours on similar facebook games, along with tiny village, tiny zoo, Oregon trail, and others on the kindle fire. Sadly ice age village is one of the worst of the group.<br />First the positives: graphics are great, everything is adorably cute. The game starts great, you grow your village at a nice pace, the game is explained well as you progress, and there are a number of 'quests' to get you going.<br />First problem - visiting friends doesn't work on the kindle at all. It's broken and to date nothing has been done about it, this makes a number of the quests impossible.<br />Next major issue: the interface leads you to accidentally removing your items from the village, or worse paying acorns for land expansions you didn't want without even realizing you've done it. Acorns are the real world cash component of the game, so losing 85 of them without any way to correct the mistake is very annoying.<br />The scratch minigame... while it is fun and challenging, its ultimately senseless, the rewards are totally random, whether you have your best game ever or just let the first 3 pirannas through it doesn't affect what you get for a reward.<br />lastly, the game doesn't add anything at later levels, within a span of a fee days you will essentially own everything you can get that doesnt involve paying real world money... in substantial amounts. for example a family of dodo birds costs 1800 acorns. 1000 acorns is $49.99, so thats $100 to buy a tiny  little square of dod birds - a family of theropod dinosaurs would cost you $200.<br /><br />overall the game is fun for a while, but needs something to keep your interest after the first couple days, needs to fix the visiting friends aspect, and needs some form of an undo for accidental spending of acorns :
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was never much of a reader, really. No books could really hold my interest for long enough to get through. Wool shattered that. The world Howey paints creates a vibrant, chilling, and completely believable picture.<br />I don't write reviews, especially for books, but all I can say is that I had a hard time pulling myself away, chapter after chapter...book after book. Constantly wanting to see where Howey would take me next. As I read the last word of Wool 5, I immediately went online to buy First Shift (Wool 6).<br />Buy the book. Just do it!

0143035711|5.0|The story of his tour in Vietnam, like many other authors, Robert Mason is telling us that he experienced pride, passion, failure, and hope, but not victory. Like thousands of other Vietnam veterans, he was deprived of victory.<br /><br />The Army doctrine of using helicopters to transport troops and materiel into and out of \\"hot LZ's\\" (when under fire) is a sad tale of incompetence, poor planning and bad doctrine on the part of the Pentagon and the Army. This book is a very good handbook that all generals and field commanders should read and understand what not to do in similar tactical situations.<br /><br />Back in 1964-65 when I was in college and the bodies of American soldiers were coming home all too regularly in those steel cases, and there were funerals all over the country - I didn't fully understand. After college and with my own subsequent tour in Vietnam as a C-130 pilot, I have a better understanding ... but only better.<br /><br />Having myself been to all the locations (not the LZ's): Pleiku (pussy mountain), Kontum, Tuy Hoa, Qui Nhon, Can Tho, Saigon and every other city and town in South Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, that only had even a rudimentary dirt runway, I know more now; but I'm still ignorant.<br /><br />The harrowing conditions under which the Army helicopter pilots lived, fought and died is told in painful detail by Warrant Officer Mason. His journey from recruitment, officer training, and flight training is as told over and over by thousands of young American men (including this writer) in their transition from civilian life to experienced combat crewman in Vietnam.<br /><br />The lessons the national leaders should learn from Chickenhawk is that during an offensive, ground should be taken and held. Troops should not be sent into \\"hot LZ's\\" and then be extracted 24 to 72 hours later, just to let the enemy reoccupy the same ground. The tactic of massive helicopter assaults landing under fire, the shooting up of the helicopters and crew, as well as the grunts, should be abandoned as a flawed doctrine. It's a worthless waste of life and equipment as Mr. Mason has so eloquently stated.<br /><br />Michael W. Rea, Captain USAF<br />Savannah, Georgia
B003VANOFY|5.0|These arrived on time as everything does with Amazon.  The packaging felt cheap and initially I thought I was buying something average.  Turns out the product itself is far superior than the packaging.  They feel well built, sturdy and like high precision instrument.  I play BF3 and when in game I can hear the sound coming from the correct direction which is why I wanted surround sound.  I'm not a big audio expert so I can't say whether the frequencies are right or wrong, but I can say is everything is clear and as I'd expect it to be.  I don't get any distortion or sounds that don't belong, even at full volume.<br />When I first used the headphones the volume control on the headset didn't work, but I updated the driver and everything works just dandy.<br />These headphones sound great, everything works and I like the feel and look of the equipment.  That's 5 stars!

0307730697|5.0|I have bought hundreds of books on Amazon and never been compelled to write a review until ten minutes ago when I finished reading Fearless. I am in awe of the emotions this story brought out in me. I laughed and cried through the beginning of the book, and cried at the end, sobbed actually. I logged in to see what others were thinking, and I will stand firm with the majority. This is the most powerful book I have ever read. It pushed so many buttons, ones that made me proud to be an American, ones that made  me feel guilty for not having done more to serve my country, but others too that made me realize it's okay. I am just on my own path in life, and that's okay. In the end, Adam Brown inspired me, even through tears (and I have never cried while reading a book, ever...) it made me feel like I could overcome anything. I will say that reading a few of the reviews here made me angry. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but it is obvious the three star reviewers either marked the story low because they did not like the audio version or, they must generally read fiction and aren't accustomed to non-fiction reporting. They did not like the narrator's voice, and that sentiment should not reflect on the quality of the story or the writing. One reviewer said the writing was horrible, and that is simply not true and I suspect this reader had an axe to grind, politically, or with the military. I consider myself a literary snob, I am a severe critic of most books and this is one of the best I have read in recent years. Top five, ever... If you are compelled to read this book, do not let the very few negative reviews dissuade you! Fearless is five stars on all counts, the story, and the writing. I intend to look more into Eric Blehm's other books, and applaud his work here. Adam Brown, you are a hero...

0345803507|5.0|The beginning of this book is very SLOW, but if you can get past the first 1/2, you will be thoroughly entertained.  I gave this book 5 stars, and the others 4 because I could not put it down at the end.<br />The book starts off while Ana and Christian are on their honeymoon and there is a lot of descriptive writing about places they visit as they travel through Europe.  I suspect the author is using this because it is something she knows more about.  Christian seems more \\"normal\\", or as normal as he can be.  There are a few side plots going on, which don't add to the overall story, but are nice to read.  It brings the best out of Christian and there are very sweet moments.  We see Ana becoming much stronger as she learns how to \\"handle\\" Christian, making her more likable than in the other two books.<br /><br />Well, you know there is a storm brewing.  As you will recall, the first two books E.L. made a point to beat us over the head with the ripping foil packets, then 2 OBGYN visits.  We don't hear anything about that in the third book...<br /><br />This book delivers two emotional scenes that are sure to leave you reading until the bitter end.<br /><br />E.L. Midnight Suns us in the last chapter.  If you know what I'm talking about then you know what to expect.<br />If you don't know what this means, expect to be further entertained with a different perspective on the same story.<br /><br />After reading all 3 books in 10 days, I wish she would have kept going with the last chapter.  I wanted to read more!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not wait to start reading the 2nd book in this trilogy and I loved it as much as the first book. Suzanne Collins delivers what is expected of an author writting a trilogy, once you finish the first book you are hooked and very grateful you have a Kindle so you can immediately download the next book and start reading....
B007UR1OHO|4.0|Good movie if you enjoy a romance with a twist and like channing tatum and rachel mcadams. The movie even says \\"inspired\\" by true events, so of course the book is better it always is! General public wants two good looking people with good chemistry and hollywood wants to sell you on a romance story with a tragic event, this does just that.

0143039504|5.0|Great Product and Much More Economical Than Buying The Individual Novels. The book is pretty thick but the text is much clearer and doesn't require a magnifying glass to read the words like my previous lost/misplaced 7 novel edition from the mid-to-late '90s. Overall I've been really enjoying revisiting the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austen and her timeless stories.

B000025H0Q|5.0|I note that a lot of reviews seem to revolve around whether this is Nick Drake's best (or as some say, his worst) album.  With all due respect, that's a sort of a goofy question.  Each of the 3 albums Drake released in his lifetime is a masterpiece, and I am happy they're so different.  Each one has been my favorite at one time or another.<br /><br />At the moment, this one is my favorite.  I find the floaty, jazzy production a perfect compliment to Drake's spare but rapid-fire lyrics.  It's also an album centered around Drake's reactions to moving to London, and the jazz-oriented, more heavily produced sound seems appropriate to the material.  The quality of the playing, production, and arrangements is first-rate.<br /><br />Drake's short sad life was unlucky in many ways, but he and we are certainly very fortunate that he found such excellent musical collaborators.  This is a true desert island disc, and definitely the best Nick Drake album... except maybe for those other two!

B006RED4GA|2.0|I love scary movies and do not like ones with gore, so I was truly hopeful when starting this film. The plot never developed and the characters, while well acted, lacked motivation and purpose. The plot line seemed focused on setting up scenes that were expectant with something scary just about to happen, but I couldn't stop thinking, \\"so what?\\" There were a couple of times where I found myself tensing up, but then I found myself thinking how stupid the story line was. The ending really ruined it for me, it seemed just plain stupid. I hate giving negative feedback about someone else's artwork, and there were good things about this film but I felt it was a flop. Sorry.
B007MDB71O|5.0|When I saw the trailers for John Carter of Mars in the theater, it looked like another mindless summer CG action movie. Aren't trailers supposed to make you want to go see a movie? It seemed like a bad mashup of [[ASIN:B006C45MRE Cowboys & Aliens]], Star Wars Phantom Menace and [[ASIN:B00000JHPN Oddworld]]. It wasn't helped by the pounding orchestral version of Kashmir. Led Zeppelin songs are becoming somewhat of a movie trailer cliche now (used recently in The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo remake, Sucker Punch). After watching it at home though, boy, am I glad to be wrong. This is a really fun movie and I gladly recommend it to action/sci-fi fans!<br /><br />Helmed by Pixar's Andrew Stanton who directed Wall-E, Finding Nemo, Bug's Life, and wrote all 4 Toy Story films, those are some impressive credentials. This is a period piece, set in the late 1800's and based on the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs (whose other creation is Tarzan). This is old-skool sci-fi/fantasy (think Jules Vernes and H.G. Wells) and the film has a very steampunk/vintage look to it to match, down to the color saturation in some scenes and film grain. The similarities to Cowboys and Aliens and Star Wars are not accidental. Jon Favreau was supposed to direct this film. There's a lot of CG in here. Much of the art design looks like Star Wars, especially the ships, because Peter Chiang headed up the art department on both. Filmed in the American southwest, there are lots of beautiful shots of canyons and geological formations. Mark Strong is always good as a bald bad guy.<br /><br />I won't give away too much of the story. John Carter, a man with a broken past, is a reluctant hero thrust into the role of savior of Mars (or Barsoom, in the story). A Civil War veteran and already a skilled fighter, his abilities are greatly magnified on Barsoom due to the difference in gravity, allowing him to leap long distances and fight with superhuman strength. Along the way, he meets a beautiful British-accented princess (played by the gorgeous Lynn Collins who's actually American) and befriends a race of green Martians.<br /><br />Aside from the obvious violence, there's not too much for parents to worry about. (It's a Disney movie after all). It's gunfights and swordplay. There's even a cute dog-monster thing. Worth watching and I'm definitely going to watch it again. It's not a thinking man's movie. Just enjoy it for the action, taut visual design, and story. I hope the DVD sales do well because I'd love to see another film made from these novels.rincess (played by the gorgeous Lynn Collins who's actually American) and befriends a race of green Martians.<br /><br />Aside from the obvious violence, there's not too much for parents to worry about.

B002EDH0FE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think it had a good plot/acting/dialog and action scenes.I liked how it was dark and a lot more adult oriented as well. I never followed the comics and I was more of a marvel guy, so I am not sure how true it was to the original, but overall it was a good movie on its own.

0345803485|5.0|I purchased this book because of a recommendation made by a friend. Prior to making my purchase, I did not read the negative reviews many people are giving this book. Had I listened to these terrible reviews I would not have purchased the set.  Frankly, after reading the first installment, I wonder if the people giving such off-putting reviews actually took the time to read it!<br /><br />Of course, each of us has our own opinion. However, I have read thousands of books in my lifetime, and I can tell you this--the book is well written.

B00020QXDG|4.0|Elvis Presley's 1974 concert at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis finally receives the BMG/Follow That Dream treatment. This 2004 reissue eliminates the overdubbed applause and provides the listener with a relatively complete show. One of his best late-period performances, Elvis gives the hometown crowd something extra by digging deeper into his gospel and 1950s repertoire. The Grammy-winning version of \\"How Great Thou Art\\" remains a standout.
B0073PZIBQ|1.0|Forget bird watching, suicide watch is more like it. Totally awful. With a cast like this I expected much more.
0674057929|5.0|Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You will want to stay up all night reading this one!  The author describes a man we would all secretly love to know.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|We went into this expecting more considering all the positive reviews on Amazon, but although the action sequences were good, the dialogue was wooden, as if they were reading off of cue cards. As other reviewers have mentioned this often dampened the action scenes. Also, I find it hard to believe that a serviceman of ANY color could disregard a direct order while flying a mission, engage single-handedly in brawls in an all-white bar, or fly off-mission (again disobeying orders) without being severely disciplined. The character \\"Lightning\\" did all of this and merely got a light tongue-lashing. As much grief as the \\"colored\\" airmen endured from the white society of that time this doesn't seem believable. Add to that a scene where one lone fighter plane sunk a battleship without dropping any bombs, only using bullets in a strafing run, or another scene where Germany used jet fighter planes to attack the slower moving bomber planes (even though NO jet planes were used in combat in that war, they were still in the experimental stages. Look it up.) I guess they felt the need to sensationalize the movie. I couldn't help comparing this movie to Memphis Belle, which had more character development and was  more believable. I would rate it as an okay movie to watch if you go into it knowing it is LOOSELY based on real events. But it could have been so much better.

B004JN1D2I|1.0|I refuse to pay double the price for the Kindle version over the actual paperback. This kind of nonsense is what pushes folks to their local library.

0345803485|1.0|I have so many issues with this book, but I will keep it short as other reviewers who gave it 1 star have already pointed out how horrible this book is. I just can't believe the hype this book is getting. Seriously? I am struggling to get through it. I am forcing myself to read it just because so many people love it and I am waiting for something great to happen. The sex is so dumb. Who calls her vagina \\"my sex\\"? And who thinks to themselves \\"jeez\\", \\"get it together steele\\" during sex? And who begins a sentence with \\"er...\\"? This is some of the worst writing I've ever read. I have actually read erotica...and this doesn't even come close. I guess if you are a lonely housewife with a boring marriage and sex life and absolutely no clue of good writing vs bad writing, this might be the book for you...

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made [[ASIN:B004JMSIRC Iron Man]] (1 & 2), [[ASIN:B001LM1456 The Incredible Hulk]] (the 2008 version), [[ASIN:B0034G4P8A Thor]], and [[ASIN:B005IZLPMY Captain America: The First Avenger]] purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable.  A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.<br /><br />Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in \\"Thor\\") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in \\"Iron Man 2\\", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.<br /><br />Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.)  For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.<br /><br />The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.y.<br /><br />Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these three books. It's not written specifically for young adults, it was well written and gripping. A very good read!
B007N0REX6|3.0|Hello everyone... To keep this short and to the point, this is a pretty good album over all. Slash is my all-time favorite guitarist, and I am a pretty big fan of Alter Bridge, so I would figure  mixing Slash with Miles Kennedy would be totally awesome, but I am a little disappointed overall. I just think Miles Kennedy's vocals are better off with Alter Bridge, and Alter Bridge is actually a better \\"band\\" to me than this album is. All in all, I guess I was expecting more of a Guns N Roses type album. The bottom line for me here is, I guess Axl Rose has been a bust without Slash, and Slash is a bust at times without Axl. This album would have been 5 stars with a more modern snare drum, and Axl Rose at vocals... P.S. I think the best song on this album maybe one of the bonus tracks \\"Crazy Life\\". Its has a Led Leppelin feel to it...

B0063IH60K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game on the Kindle. The moves are easy to do by simply tapping the card or column. The various options are great.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The writing is better with this book over the first one, but its Hunger Games redo. All the while I wondered how these were a best seller then I saw it was published by Scolastic. Instant audiances of millions of school kids who are encouraged to read and buy books.  I just was not impressed with the story or how wishy washy our hero was the last two books.  She started so tough, I liked Katnis way better in the first book.
0307592731|5.0|I admire the author for many reasons--one for revealing so much of herself--and then not so much for undertaking the PCT but for undertaking it without any idea of what she was doing--putting herself into serious pain--and depite the conditions not giving up!!<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" by John Krakauer comes to mind when reading the book. Cheryl running from her past--running from emotional pain--into a world of extremes on the PCT--not knowing what she will find in front of her--much like the character in Into the wild--unlike McCandless..fortunately for Cheryl--her ending was a good one!!!<br /><br />For those who may choose to follow the path--searching for something--seek out some advice at least on equipment!! I'll bet if you ask Cheryl today if she could have shaved 20 pound off her load what the difference might have made....and I'm sure if you were able to ask Christopher McCandless if he would rethink going into the wild without a map which showed that there was a way across the river only 1/2 mile from the bus where he died--he would be the first to advocate being better prepared.<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is truly inspirational-and highly recommended!
030788743X|5.0|This needs a 6-star rating, 5 stars just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I received this book free though a Goodreads give-away.<br /><br />This book isn't going to appeal to everyone. Ready Player One relates the story of how a small group of virtual reality (OASIS) addicts fought against nasty corporate drones to seek out the Easter Egg set by the originator of the OASIS game environment. This was to be done by finding 3 keys and their subsequent gates using prodigious amounts of pop-culture from the past---mostly the 1980's as experienced by a Midwestern USA youth.<br /><br />A simple enough plot. What makes it magical is Ernest Cline's deft balancing of 80s trivia with his obvious love of geeky folk everywhere. In this regard it reminded me of the movie Galaxy Quest wherein a bunch of geeky SF fans save the day by virtue of just being themselves. Here in Ready Player One large numbers of people escape their dismal reality by venturing into an entirely immersive virtual reality simulator--and the geekiest of them seek out the prize laid down by the game's originator, James Halliday. A prize worth billions and carrying with it, the potential to save the world. Or just flee it.<br /><br />This book is like Stephenson's Snow Crash without the philosophy. A thrilling ride with danger around every corner, both virtual and real, and a Shrek-like love story in the background. With a lot of War Games stuffed in. There's even Easter Eggs in the book--in a few places the plot seems to \\"shimmy\\" a bit and you might think that was an editing mistake. But twice I realized those little asides were actually wink-and-a-nod references to movies. The other asides I didn't recognize. I guess I don't know the 80's as well as Cline does.<br /><br />No summary of this book can relate just how good it is. You need to read it. Right now.
B005ZUR724|4.0|some quests are &quot;broken&quot; so it could use some fixing more often but its a fun game its essentially like world of warcraft so if you like that its cheap and easy on the go fun on my kindle fire I gave 4 stars because its not perfect but it does pass the time well
B007L4HET8|3.0|This is simply a re-release of the previous Spider-Man 3 blu-ray (that was released individually and as part of the Spider-Man Trilogy box set).  You can find those below:<br />[[ASIN:B0018KSB5C Spider-Man 3 [Blu-ray] (2007)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man: The High Definition Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />There are only two additions to this new release - the cover art is different (and not very good in my opinion), and they have included an Ultraviolet digital copy so that you will be able to stream the movie to various devices.<br /><br />Now for what's missing... there used to be a second disc which included some great bonus material about shooting the film, creating the villains, etc.  It's a shame that the studio did not include that disc in this new version.<br /><br />My understanding is that they used the same transfer as the previous release, and so the picture/audio quality is the same as on the previous disc (and it is very good).<br /><br />In short, if you already own this movie then there really is no need to buy this... it's not much of an upgrade unless you want that Ultraviolet copy of the film.<br /><br />**For a limited time, if you purchase this blu-ray through Amazon, it will come with $10 movie cash that you can use on \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" in theaters (promotion ends 8/3/12).  This movie cash promo is also available for a limited time at many local retailers like Target and Best Buy.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|not a bad game, would be 5 but for the ton of ads at the beginning of gameload every single time!
B007L4HFDI|4.0|At this point, I will assume that everyone is familiar with the film itself - it is a great piece of entertainment.  The film itself, the image quality, and the audio specs all remain the same as the previous blu-ray release: [[ASIN:B0042AGNC8 Spider-Man [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />Here are the main differences between the previous Spider-Man blu-ray and this newer version:<br />- Bonus Material, including an audio commentary and several featurette (all of which come from the Special Edition DVD but were not on the previous blu-ray) have been included here.<br />- There is new cover art for the blu-ray<br />- Included is an Ultraviolet streaming copy of the film that works with various portable devices so that you can watch the film on-the-go.<br /><br />Obviously, the studio is releasing this new blu-ray to capitalize on/promote \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" film which arrives in theaters this summer.  But the least they could have done for this \\"new\\" blu-ray is give us some new material, whether it be an extended cut of the film or some new features.<br /><br />So while I love this movie, I really see no reason to buy it again because it doesn't add much to the experience that I am getting now with the previous Spider-Man discs that I own.  But if you are new to blu-ray or did not own the previous version, then I highly recommend you pick this up.<br /><br />And below are links to \\"Spider-Man 2\\" and \\"Spider-Man 3\\":<br />[[ASIN:B007L4HF74 Spider-Man 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B007L4HET8 Spider-Man 3 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]
0385738765|2.0|I fell in love with the first book of this series, The Maze Runner. I was so excited to see how James Dashner was going to twist this story to make it as thrilling and intriguing as the first book. So, I read and read, waiting for that big moment that was going to knock my socks off, but it never came. I needed a big shocking plot. Yes, it did have some twists here and there, new characters, and a new scenario, but it was BORING. All in all I was not impressed. I guess he set the bar really high with his first book, where as the second book was just trying too hard.<br /><br />I kept putting it down, and not really wanting to pick it back up. If you know me, when I like a book, my face is literally buried in that book until I'm done.<br /><br />I tried really really hard to finish this book, and after forcing myself to sit and read, I did accomplish to finish this book. Now I am left with a \\"I just read a really bad book\\" feeling. I am really hoping that the next two books in my summer list are good, so this feeling goes away!<br /><br />I don't think I will read the third book, since I lost my interest.<br /><br />From: [...]
0345803485|3.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]] PLEASE, PLEASE, don't spend your money unless you're a teenager. No self respecting 21 yr. old, especially one who has no self confidence, college grad would be this taken in by an older, handsome, multi millionaire way out of her league to even contemplate joining him in his preposterous self-serving schemes. I find the whole premise laughable. I find the female in need of serious therapy, and the \\"male\\" dispictable in regard to the lengths he goes to to get sex. You would think he was the \\"elephant man\\". Is this going to turn out to be \\"Beauty & the Beast\\"??Granted, I'm only halfway thru, but will give the benefit of a doubt to finish to see if there are any redeeming factors. To be continued after I finish \\"book 1\\"......

B0080YGZ20|3.0|I listened to the \\"Live at Sing Sing Studios\\" videos on youtube and was floored by this amazing talent. Her band is solid as well.<br />I bought the CD Vows as soon as it came out in the US and was disappointed by how watered down the producers made the album. The punch the drums had on the youtube videos is not there. Instead they are replaced with electronic percussion. The energy is just not the same.<br /><br />I would still recommend the CD, or at least purchasing some of the better songs like \\"Good Intent\\", \\"Cameo Lover\\" or \\"Two Way Street\\". Kimbra's voice is melodic and pleasant and powerful. The songs blend Jazz with pop, which is very refreshing to hear in this day of cookie cutter pop singers playing 3 chord music.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This app its awesome. I can't get enough.started over so I could do it all over again. Oh ya. Kill zombies!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book repulsive.  This is not what anyone in the world today needs to be reading or buying into.  I hate the thought of young adults getting their hands on this book and thinking these are things that need to be happening.  This is not what freedom of speech was created for!  At least I was able to return for a refund!

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game it's very addictive and hard to stop playing , the leveles get progressively harder, it's lots of fun and I would definitely recommend it to my friends .
B0086700CM|4.0|When you first start to play there are lots of glitches (at least on the kindle fire) which makes it kind of hard. But after you play for a while they stop.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie has two parts to it, the love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Miranda (Kajol), and Rizwan's quest to speak to the president and declare, \\"My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist.\\" The Rizwan-Miranda love story is portrayed as Rizwan's flashback while traveling to Washington D.C. to meet the president. I believe this technique was quite effective and did not disrupt the flow of the story. Both parts are just as good and gives variety to the film.<br /><br />Rizwan grew up as a Muslim in India and was later diagnosed with the mental illness called the Asperger's syndrome. After being sponsored by his brother in America to move to the states, he meets Miranda, a Hindu who falls in love and marries Rizwan. Just when everything seems perfect, the 9/11 attacks took place and the post-9/11 prejudice tears the couple apart. Miranda sarcastically tells Rizwan to tell the president that he is not a terrorist before he is allowed to see her again. Rizwan takes it seriously and begins his quest.<br /><br />In addition to the great plot, the movie incorporated good humor and religious significance. One thing I love about this film is that it attacks many stereotypes against Muslims and shows that Islam is not about violence. In one of the scenes, Rizwan confronts some Muslim extremists and explains the true meaning of Islam and the brotherhood that they share. It also reminds you of the hardship that innocent Muslims have to bear after the terrorist attacks. The perfect love story destroyed by a few extremists makes you watch with compassion.<br /><br />I seldom watch Bollywood movies, but the high movie ratings made me give it a try. And surely, the ratings didn't lie and it is a must-see Bollywood film, especially for those who need a new perspective of Islam.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun, buy there are to many advertisements. All I want to do is play the games and bot be offered various things inbetween.

0060936223|2.0|I have a historian friend who adored this book because she was familiar with Mapplethorpe's work, was unfamiliar with Patti Smith's life, and enjoyed reliving what was an exciting time in her own life. I, on the other hand, completely lost interest about a third of the way into the book. I was in and out of New York during most of the time the book covers. The characters that Smith goes to pains to describe weren't interesting to me then and they are even less interesting to me now. And I find her matter of fact descriptions of people somewhat off putting - like one person is as good as another. Perhaps Smith really is that egalitarian in her relations with everyone, I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't interested in Mapplethorpe except that he was close with Smith whose work I have always admired. Mapplethorpe's work, beyond the incredible mastery of light and dark, is frankly trite and uninteresting. Smith always represented for me a kind of rebellion that I wasn't able to achieve myself, so the book seems to describe someone who is just trying to find a career and follow some presumed predestination, which I found disappointing, and there is no evidence of any anger toward the universe. I'm happy for her if she really doesn't feel that kind of angst, but I'm also disappointed. I thought she was doing battle with the gods and it turns out she was just a lost waif.<br />So, I am happy that I got the book so heavily discounted and didn't have much invested in it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Lots of useful info is provided. The UI is simple and easy to navigate. Changing locations is very useful too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Almost perfect! Does everything I can think of that I would like to do with this app. Love the ease of changing translations.
0345803485|1.0|Dont buy the book. Rent it from the library if you really can not help yourself. I bought it from walmart and Im very disappointed that I did. I wish I read the reviews on here before I did.<br /><br />To the other people like me who bought the book:<br /><br />Sell your book on ebay. I just did and I made a profit. ($12 at walmart) Check ebay and see how much people are bidding for it. Its almost as ridiculous as the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I have it on all of my ipods and I unlocked everything and ive been wait to get it on my kindle fire for so long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000QE1U9K|1.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />Put aside the fact that Newt, Hicks, and Bishop did not survive. Put aside the fact that Ripley miraculously ends up with criminals at a prison. Put aside Ripley being impregnated somehow with a queen and committing suicide by falling into lava. Put aside all the silly, idiotic stuff in the script. What the first two movies had that this one horribly lacked was tension. It had gore and grossness, but without the tension, it was as scary as trick-or-treaters on Halloween night.<br /><br />I loved Alien. I really enjoyed Aliens. After having seen this one, I just choose to ignore it altogether as though it never happened.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very entertaining! Although, I wish there wasnt so much pressure to share on facebook or twitter and the lack of &quot;energy&quot;
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I should have read the other reviews before I made my purchase. I am at chapter 12 of this awful, awful book. Erotic this is not. There is little attempt made to create lustful suspense and it certainly isn't shocking.<br />This is a badly written book with poorly drawn characters. The highly experienced billionaire philanthropist dominant jumps into bed with the email-less, beautiful, 21 year old virgin? Really? Or should I say \\"oh my\\".<br />I always finish a book, so I no doubt will finish this one but it will be a difficult slog. Perhaps if the author had used a thesaurus every now and then and re-read the manuscript at least once, this may not have turned out quite so badly.<br />For those who have read this book and enjoyed it, good luck to you. For me, this book goes into the same class as trashy celebrity or reality TV. You don't need talent. Just create a sense of infamy or scandal and folks will line your wallet with money.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is sooo awesome I would give 100 stars if possible. Who ever made this game should get some kina reward!
159448385X|5.0|This was one of thes best books I have ever read.  I fell in love with the main characters and was sad when the story ended.
0671449028|2.0|I have a bunch of her books but this one is my least favorite.  It just doesn't make sense.  The animals take a bath, put on their pj's and then go upstairs to exercise.  I know it's a kids book but it's kind of annoying.  Maybe I'd feel differently if I was read this story as a child.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|I think black veil brides has come a long way since we stitch these wounds.  that albums was really good-no doubt.  now, however--in the last two years this band has rocketed.. don't know if since CC coma joined the band but my god they rock!!  all five members are truly talented.  their lyrics resonate & drums blast it...  love all five of their personalities & looks-but it is the music that carries them through.  they have won soooo many magazine covers, awards & worldwide tours... Go bvb-can't wait till the next album. YOU GUYS ARE TRULY AMAZING LIVE-LOVE YOUR SHOWS IN VENUE. AND SET THE WORLD ON FIRE IS EXACTING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|very addicting and at times very frustraiting I play this game every day incantation get enough of it. I'm hoping by doing this review it will give mefree stuff
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|Most people like the later albums that are so placid and professional, beautiful (I couldn't see me part from those albums Darkside/Wall/Wish etc.)<br />Yet I don't feel they have the adventure, timelessness and strange sounds of the first album. The poetic quality of the lyrics, the images they deliver<br />are high above the semi-Bob Dylan/Lou Reed stuff that Waters published. Ok i like the Wall but if I had to choose I'd stuck with the Piperalbum.<br />There are really not much real psychedelic albums. The Doors, Dark Star (G.Dead), Piper/1st 3 Hendrix albums and the Family (1st two albums) are really psychedelic,<br />so a lot of stuff that many people see as psych is in fact dripping in soul/standard pop, blues etc. So I think the Psychedelic album is Piper, virually no<br />other has that quality. Later Floyd stuff is great but sounds too glamorous, perfect, and in my view \\"Pop-album' like. And I don't like it when its too popular.<br />It is perfected untill all life is polished out of the surface.
B0086700CM|5.0|Dude, this thing is so cool! why would u not want a game that practices not falling to your death? jk, but this game's awesome! :3

B0086700CM|5.0|when i got this game it was awsome now i can play it all the time and keep on winning
0345803507|5.0|I thought book 2 may be my favorite. . .I quickly changed my mind.  This book had much increased suspense but continued with characteristics of book one and two.  I highly recommend buying the whole series and clearing your schedule.  Totally worth it!
B0086700CM|5.0|once you start...its hard to stop.<br />it starts off pretty easy but quickly speeds up and gets difficult.  it stays fun either way<br />.
0345803493|5.0|This book came across somewhat different than the first book with the plot. . .As I read it I thought it may be my favorite book in the series!
B00631HASU|5.0|ive played this so much- I've beat it 4 times now but each time i find new hidden objects in it that give me extra amulets.

B0086700CM|5.0|finally temple run came out on kindle fire!!!I am so so so soooo happy it is a great game to play!!;)
1594203334|5.0|Immensely insightful book on how societally-drivien we are when it comes to raising our children. I loved the following insights:<br /><br />1. The historical grounding that Druckerman provides for why the French raise their kids the way they do.<br />2. French mothers almost subconsciously put their babies on a feeding schedule - 8am, Noon, 4p, 8pm<br />3. Weekend baking is an essential exercise in teaching kids moderation and patience<br />4. \\"Merci\\" and \\"S'il vous plait\\" are essential but \\"Bonjour\\" and \\"Au Revoir\\" are considered even more essential in French civilized society to put kids on an even footing with adults and to start to get them to look beyond themselves. I have a wonderful French neighbor who constantly emphasizes this with my kids, now I know why.<br />5. Whereas the US way of raising children is typically focused on development (and often anally so), the French way is focused on self-awareness and self-discovery.<br />6. French mothers do not feel guilty for taking time for themselves or their mate. For instance: The babysitter or relative takes their child to swim lessons while the mother and her partner go enjoy a nice lunch together.<br />7. French mothers mostly work. Few stay at home for reasons of financial independence and to \\"participate more fully ins society\\". Being a working mom is also much much easier in France thanks to all of the social programs in that country and thanks to much less stigma around nursery schools.<br /><br />I believe that this book is much more than just a cute culural difference story. It will change the way that many US moms think about child-rearing and my hope is that many of us will learn toput ourselves and our partners first far more often. Here's to seeing far fewer stressed-out, maxed-out moms!
B006Z4LOPK|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. Buffy + Charmed + True Blood = Lost Girl. Great story line. i watched the first season non stop. i could not stop watching!

B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all the books, couldn't put them down.  Though you can tell the author is not a writer and some of the events are a little out there but the love story was wonderful.  She is very creative in creating such great characters.  When I was finished with the 3rd book I was disappointed that that was it, no more of Ana and Christian.  Though I do hope that maybe she writes a 4th book about their lives as parents and how it has affected their relationship both emotionally and sexually.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Purchased this for my son as a gift. We have seen this film before. Since all my children were born in Alaska, they have heard about this episode about the demise of this young man. They made a trip to the bus to see for themselves where he spent the last part of his life. Since then, they have made a few more trips there. Taking my grandson to it a couple of years ago. It does exist - have pictures of my sons taken next to the bus.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Let me start off by saying that this is my first time assigning a one-star rating to a book. Most bad books usually possess something redeeming enough to warrant two or three-stars. Unfortunately that is not the case here.  This book is an epic fail.<br /><br />Simply put, this book is a waste of money. The best thing going for this book was the brevity of it. This book offers no practical advice on how to stand out amongst the noisy marketplace and sell ebooks. This book is a bunch of motivation, feel good hodge podge that's befitting of a Tony Robbins seminar. In other words, this book mostly contains empty feel good, motivational sayings that lack substance. Thank goodness his fiction is a lot better than this how-to manual of nothingness.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/21/2012:<br />I discovered via a New York Times article that the author had purchased hundred of reviews.  I'm not sure which books or which reviews were bought, but given the number of 5-star reviews that this book had received I suspect that the majority of those reviews were purchased too.  As a self-published writer, I can tell you firsthand that there is no practical advice within this book that will help you sell books... NONE.  Don't believe me?  Just follow the hodgepodge nothingness within this book without buying the reviews first.  If you don't piss off everyone that isn't your mother with spamming and tweeting them to death then I will be totally shocked.<br /><br />While I hate this book with a burning passion, I still recommend that readers and aspiring writers alike to buy his fictional novels because he truly has a remarkable gift for writing fiction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was just truly amazing. I find these books just breath-taking. They leave you wondering. Suzanne Collins is a true author. I have to say. This series is so amazingly good. I could not stop reading this book. I highly recommend this book. If you can take some violence, READ THIS!!!!!!!!! (: Also watch the movie. The book is better though. Well, that is all I have to say... Thanks so much! (:
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun to play it is very cool but it could have some improvements<br /> it should make it where you can choose where to go a lot more than what people usually
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book by other reviews. I'm immensely impressed at the quality of writing from an \\"unknown,\\" but I'm sure that Hugh Howey will quickly rise in fame in the sci-fi genre. This book rivals some of the best novels I've read, ever. I found it as a kindle recommendation from amazon, read a few reviews, and after convincing myself to give it a shot - I am now compelled to write a review of my own. I've recommended this book to several friends already. I don't like my reviews to contain spoilers, so I will refrain from revealing any of the plot (you can find that in the description), but as a fan of character-development combined with strong plotlines - I am thoroughly pleased with Wool. In fact, I'd say that I may even go into a slight depression knowing that the book is over. Hugh Howey - congratulations, because you have not only come up with a fantastic, fast, twisting, deep plot...but you did it with characters who the reader loves and cheers for. I think this book transcends \\"sci-fi\\" and is just a good story that anyone should read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it.I think evrey one should get this app.It 's awesome.It is one of the best apps I could get.remember get this app.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I personally enjoy this game. its great to pass the time. to bad they didn't make Lep before Mario. They should make more games like this maybe a remake of that gorilla guy.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This is a great game!  However, there seems to be a glitch for some of us between the Station Clock time  and the Train Schedule times.  I looked everywhere for a solution, but the only ones mentioned did not work for me.  I DID notice that the people who had problems all had different Train Schedule  times than I did.  So I decided to start the whole game over, and it totally solved the glitch (other than having to play all those worlds over again).
B0086700CM|5.0|this game, temple run is better on the kindle than the ipod or iphone version. the screen is bigger, it moves more to your liking

B00006RCOB|4.0|The film follwed tha book very carefully.  I read the original book whileI was traveling to europe.  Sometime's the writers of the film go to far in cuttin out or changing the facts from the book.  Clint Eastwood as star & Director normally finds the story he has choosen for a film production tobe as good as necessary to mke a riviting movie,  The only thing missing making a movie of the follow-upbook \\"Firefox Down\\"
B0086700CM|4.0|it is kinds fun but I hate how u can just buy coins with real money and not have to earn them.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|All I seek is middle of the road entertainment, but this was subpar, boring and contrived.  I'm only grateful that it wasn't peppered with over exaggerated, gratuitous teenage sex and raunch.[[ASIN:B0083GPDBO Chronicle]]
B007SGM084|3.0|I cannot believe tht the author managed to get three books out of this .... seems to me that one book on erotic would have covered it.  By the end of book one, I was so bored with the \\"story\\" that I did not bother to read 2 and 3
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is so much fun. I only gave it 4 stars because I find it difficult. but try this game out. good for all ages. don't play it while operating heavy machinery.

B007CGLRWA|3.0|While A. Brody's performance was above average compared to most Hollywood actors, the movie was bleak much like the educators depicted in this movie. All of whom appeared to be either mentally unstable or troubled.<br /><br />Having worked in public schools in the inner city, suburbs,  rural areas, on the east coast and the west coast, I can write with certitude SOME scenes are rather believable.  For one, the educational system is in a state of disarray. SOME teachers are jaded, SOME caregivers are indifferent, and SOME students (and parents) are disrespectful.<br /><br />If a director wants to portray the negatives of public education in the United States of America, they will start with THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, and our OPEN BORDERS.
B0086700CM|2.0|this game is not that fun when it glitches a lot so I rate this game two stars nobody wants glitches

B0053O89KG|5.0|When my friend first told me about this show, I had no interest in adding another \\"cop\\" show to my DVR. I was late to the game, when one day I happen to catch an episode in the third season! One episode and I was hooked, I now own seasons 1-3 and can't wait for the fourth season to be released. The writing for this show is so smart! Each episode is brilliant and one that can be watched over and over again. The relationships really make the show, Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion are so great together. This show offers it all; mystery, drama, action, romance and family. Each character feels like a main character in this show, you will fall in love with each of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. its truly addicting and its a game you could play while waiting for the bus on the bus etc. I reccomend it to anyone.

The book has many examples that drive its points home, and this allowed me to best learn the information. What was particularly significant for me is that I have no desire in starting up a \\"business business\\" (large corporation, etc.). I desire a simple one-man operation, and this book will become my bible. Now don't get me wrong, if you want the big business model, this book is very helpful in that regard as well. This is definitely a must read for anyone who wants financial freedom.
0143119680|5.0|I really loved this book..  All though it was kinda of like Twilight meets Harry Potter and then becomes Outlander.  All of my favorite book series'.  It is nice to read a novice writer that is not full of them self. The only negative is who ever edited the book did a horrible job.  I read word for word where most people don't so I caught a lot of mistakes.  I hope the next book is better edited.  I got completely lost in this book and can't wait for the 2nd book to come out.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I recently purchased the SB-700 to replace a faltering SB-600 that I purchased in 2005 to work with a Nikon D50. I now shoot with the Nikon D7000, and I've found the SB-700 to be an excellent companion to that setup. I'd venture to say, this is the best all-around choice for most people shooting a D3000/D5000/D7000 series DSLR from Nikon.<br /><br />OUTPUT<br />While the extra features are great, the ultimate measure of a flash is its output. Carrying the SB-600 since 2005, I always found its output to be more than adequate for my needs (event photography, and other mostly indoor or medium-range outdoor uses). Although the SB-600 is slightly more powerful than the SB-700, I've found the difference to be negligible at best. Bottom line, while the reach of the SB-400 is too shallow for me, I've found the SB-600/SB-700 to be the perfect balance of power, size, and function.<br /><br />USER INTERFACE<br />Especially when shooting with a Nikon body, the SB-700 is setup to simply work with your camera out of the box. There's really nothing to configure unless you want to dig into the more advanced features of this unit. Should you choose to dig into those features, you'll find Nikon has done a great job laying out the controls in a logical manner. Output patterns, and flash modes are each individual switches. The scroll wheel makes accessing, and using other on-screen features much easier than the navigation on my old SB-600. Overall, I'm really impressed with the SB-700's interface; I consistently forgot how to access certain functions on the SB-600, an issue I've yet to encounter with the SB-700.<br /><br />WIRELESS OPERATION (CREATIVE LIGHTING SYSTEM)<br />To help add more depth to your photos, the SB-700 can be triggered remotely as part of the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS). This has to be one of my favorite parts of the SB-700 when paired with my D7000. The SB-700 can serve as a Master or Remote (Slave) unit. While the Nikon CLS certainly isn't as robust as using Pocket Wizards, it's one of my camera's built-in functions. The power switch has Off, On, Remote, and Master positions, so putting the SB-700 in Remote (slave) mode is very easy. Switching the built-in flash on my D7000 to Master mode, I am now able to fire the SB-700 wirelessly (without anything other than my camera and the SB-700). The ability to remotely trigger a flash was not something I could do with my D50/SB-600 setup, and has added a whole new dimension to my photography.<br /><br />OTHER FEATURES<br />Shortly after purchasing my SB-600 in 2005, I also found a need for a diffuser. While a diffusion dome was a relatively inexpensive purchase, it was a separate purchase nonetheless. In unboxing the SB-700, I was happy to discover Nikon chose to include a diffusion dome with the SB-700.<br /><br />In fact, not only does Nikon include a diffusion dome with the SB-700, they also include an incandescent and fluorescent filter. These color the flash to help with white balance. In addition to this, I've also found the incandescent filter helpful for \\"warming up\\" the lighting on subjects.<br /><br />Another nice addition (over the SB-600) was the addition to an integrated reflector card. I would frequently carry an index card a rubber band with my SB-600 as another way to soften the light coming from my flash. The integrated reflector card within the SB-700 makes it a lot easier to use or not use a reflector card between shots, and certainly makes for a more professional presentation.<br /><br />In summary, I've found the SB-700 to be an incredibly solid unit. I'd venture to say this is the best general purpose flash for Nikon DSLR's. Unless you specifically need the additional output power of the SB-900/SB-910 units provide, the SB-700 is a very good choice for anyone shooting a D3000/D5000/D7000 series DSLR.

B006VA57CY|1.0|The Product, 'Amazon instant video' was a pain in the arse, as for a second night in a row I've been forced to abandon my attempts to watch 'Downton Abbey', by having been thwarted by the complete lack of video related menus and video related-assistance.  There was TONS of assistance to SELL-SHOP-BUY BUY! BUY!!!, but not a DAMN thing about if I might find a closed caption subtitle for my hearing impairted Husband. I Dare say, \\"He won't be using AMazon anytime soon, We are both COMPLETELY disappointed in the product and very disappointed in Amazon.

B000EXZ9P4|5.0|Knopfler and Emmy Lou Harris might seem an odd combo, but they complement each other gracefully in this album.  Some wonderful harmonies with a touch of the expected nod to country music.  It's fun and good music.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|I love Mark W - he has been great in all the movies I have seen with him in it.  I loved the action and non stop twists and turns in this movie.  I would recommend it if you love spy thriller type of movies.
0307959856|4.0|In ideal world of Jane Austen, one does not need profound investigation into wicked matters, especially when it comes to the rather half-witted sister and brother-in-law of the Darcys and the Bingleys. A modern, CSI tint into the story would spoil Ms. James attempt to put suspense in all that's well, so the book is thus presented. It's not perfect, but it's dreamy still. If one should look for a material to finish while completing a trans-ocean journey, this book may be it.
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|The best song on the cd is Let's have a kiki.  This cd is not the best they have put out but it is still very listenable. The video for Baby Come Home, their next single, is a riot!  Will being seeing them on 6-27-2012 in Royal Oak Music Theatre-cant wait.<br /><br />Give it a try!

1612680011|5.0|An work associate was telling me about the steps he and his wife were taking to become financially independent and what the last 10 years had brought them in terms of getting closer and closer to being financially independent; achieving real wealth.  His story impressed me. When I asked him how he got his game plan and learned to see things the way he explained them to me, he cited this book.<br /><br />My father gave me a few nuggets of wisdom to help guide me financially, which (had I followed) would have put me in a better state financially than I'm in how; however, it was  this book that helped connect those \\"dots\\" (or nuggets) and make everything click in my mind.  I now see how to become financially independent, understand the importance of REAL assets, and am now working on putting together a new game plan. Wish I'd have read this 20 years ago.... Alas.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is that it reads as friend-to-friend conversation.  I hadn't gotten past Chapter 2 but that my \\"wheels\\" were already turning; the creative energy flowing.  I've already recommended this book to friends and will continue to do so.  It really opened my eyes!
B0086700CM|5.0|totally adicting I have it on everything that I can! I lllllllooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeee this game its so fun! it is do cool and awesome!
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a simple game but surprisingly addicting. I like the explorer concept and the powerups. The graphics could be better but doesn't take away from the overall. fun factor.
B007SGM084|1.0|Wow this is too expensive for a Kindle version of book.  No printing costs, etc, to recoup so why?  (Other than greed).  Just get real...

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was my first purchase for my kindle touch.  Love that I don't need to carry around the big books!  The trilogy was a very good read.  Hard to put down once I started reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy the rush of going faster and quicker to stay in the game longer. a down fall I have with this game is I can't just choose to be a female in the beginning. I need to save up $10,000 to get a female character?? it takes forever (at least for me cause I want to upgrade my dude)
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I just love Rhianna anyway, but I really think this is her best CD. I could listen to her all day, even if she sang the telephone book. GREAT CD!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love restaurant story! It is so fun! Download it! You won't regret it!:) The gems are expensive and not worth it. But with an exception of that it is spectacular!
B00454U1NS|5.0|What can you say about P!nk that hasn't been said? She has an awesome voice and this CD is fantastic! My favorite song is \\"Eventually\\" but there are so many good songs on the CD, I love them all!

0930289234|5.0|I spent a lot of moneybfor the expedited shipping for this item, but it was worth every cent. I love this book. It kept me intrigued for weeks and is now my favorite book. The art is awesome, the plot is well planned, and the brilliant symbolism such as the smiley face crater on mars and the use of clocks as a countdown to Armageddon amazed me. This book had so many interesting \\"types\\" that it was practically like the bible of comic books. Worth every cent!
B006VA57CY|5.0|I absolutely love this show!! The acting is amazing. Maggie Smith is just stupendous. I love the whole portrayal of how the aristocracy had to deal with changes.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|very fun and addictive<br />this game has very good graphics and is one of my favorite games to play<br />highly recommended
B005HSG3TC|4.0|My daughter gave me a Kindle Fire, and a cover that cost about $40.00.  Mr. Frugality that I am, I could not \\"get\\" the idea of spending $40.00 to cover a $200.00 item.  I returned the expensive cover and got this one online for about $10.00.  It is entirely adequate for the purpose.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Waste of money and time.I really could not see any story in this book. It was just sex over and over and over again. I am not a prude but it got old real fast.
0439023513|2.0|I read the first two books in the series and couldn't put the books down.  But this one....well....I had to struggle to get through it.  It was a real struggle until about two-thirds of the way through, then the action picked up.  But the book really was a disappointment.  Unfortunately, the third book needs to be read to resolve all the issues generated in the first two books (I can't stand unresolved plots!). But if unresolved plots don't bother you, don't bother reading this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant put it down literaly it's so addicting it's awesome. I love getting coins when I'm done with the game!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is awesome, each book makes you want to read the next one. It's more than just about sex, there is really a good story line. I enjoyed all three books & wanted more.

B002TYZKIM|2.0|I actually own this DVD as I think it gives valuable insight into who Michael Jackson was, particularly before his death.  There are a few things I found to be a BIT illuminating, given the idea we have of who he was. The movie was made after his death... however, the film starts with an endorsement for Obama - something that clearly was not possible. We have no idea if Michael would have endorsed Obama - and I find it disrespectful that the ad is in there in the first place.  (And it is a rather lengthy ad.)<br />The other thing, if you are truly a fan of Michael Jackson's work - you're not going to find much good work here.  He was a perfectionist, as is obvious by all his other work... I suspect he would not have liked to have his rehearsals shown.  Rehearsal is exactly that - re herse.<br />Having said that, I've watched it a few times.  Clearly there were those he truly loved working right along side him - and that's a lovely thing to see.  He also looks fragile and weak, disoriented at times - and like there is no way he could have withstood the pressures of the actual production had it gone that far.  I didn't know angels could be so humanely fragile and damaged,yet powerful, at the same time.
0345803485|4.0|This story is just sooo sad. Christian is a guy that his past has had an impact on him. He just happens to find the right person to love but can't come to love her. A lot of people go through things like this. He just happens to release his anger in a different way. Even thought it did bother me very much to read. But he's not a bad person and you can tell. As for Ana she's just an innocent chick that has no idea what she's put herself up to. I find so sad that she lost her virginity to this man that was so rough with her. When I heard about this book on the Ellen show that Bethanny Frankel mentioned it It seemed so interesting I had to read it. I did and I am on the second book. This book doesn't represent fantasy it represents a real life story, at least that's how I see it. I know there's probably someone out there that can relate to things that the author expresses in this book. One person can't change the world but they sure as hell can help someone change their their world.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run and instantly bought it when I saw it. I only have one tip; do NOT (if your playing on kindle fire) press the power button in the middle of a run. if you do,  the game will become very glitchy and its annoying. the only way to fix it is to uninstall and then install it again losing all your progress. please listen because I had to do this twice now and it is annoying
0345803485|5.0|From beginning to end...I was enraptured into these books.  The second book and the third at the end made me cry.  I have never enjoyed reading anything as much as these books.
0345803493|5.0|I bought this for my wife after she finished the first book, because, frankly, I didn't want the great sex to end! Something about this series turned my wife on and it definately did a number on our sex life.<br /><br />Buy it
B000002B2X|4.0|Alice In Chains had put themselves on both the alternative and heavy metal maps with a pulverizing set of songs courtesy of their debut LP `Facelift'. As a follow-up, the band came out of left field with a mostly acoustic EP called `Sap'. Intended to be rough demos for future records, the quartet reconsidered and put `Sap' out warts and all in early 1992. `Sap' got little if any national recognition until the song \\"Got Me Wrong\\" appeared on the `Clerks' movie soundtrack two years later and became an alt-rock radio favorite.  Four songs, (not counting the mostly instrumental nonsense hidden track) with each song possessing a certain sense of the bleak but also each seemed to be filled with a tremendous harmonic strength.  \\"Brother\\" is probably my favorite but all are noteworthy including the all-star Seattle jam, \\"Right Turn\\". Ann Wilson also makes some notable vocal contributions to both \\"Brother\\" and \\"Am I Inside\\", keeping the Seattle connection alive and not limiting it to just the grunge underground. `Sap' is more than a happy accident and it is a worthwhile purchase for anyone who wants to know what the fuss was all about, from a true indie rock standpoint.
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|I was not keen on reading this knowing it was about an abduction and then many years of keeping a girl prisoner.  But in the end, in the eyes of her child it was quite nice to read.  I definitely recommend this book.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I like this show so much that it surprises, no, astonishes me.<br /><br />Now I am surprised, no, astonished at the absence of a Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />What gives?  This is a hit show for MTV.  We know the high-def masters exist.  I watched it on MTV-HD.  I can get HD digital downloads from Amazon.<br /><br />Seriously, if you missed this show when it first showed, give it a try.  I haven't been this surprised by horror on TV since Spike's \\"Blade.\\"  It seems that \\"Teen Wolf\\" is finding an audience, so hopefully it will fare better.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is a fun action type flick and to me is the best in the mission impossible series especially because I didn't like the first 3 but I loved this one. Plus my favorite comedy style actor is Simon Pegg and they gave his character Benji Dunn more comedic parts to lighten the story better... so instead of being so bad it becomes too goofy like 2 and 3, or it being too action packed that it gets boring and predicable quick making it a bad movie like the first Mission: Impossible, it is a fun, action packed, spy flick just like my first Bond flick known as Goldeneye. I love this movie because it's like this and you will too.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|It felt like you are watching the book on fast forward.  everything was cut down.  one example was the parade scene.  seems like it was about a minute long.  i left the theater feeling exhausted because it felt like i was speed reading.

1594488843|1.0|My own view on Drive is that Pink gets a little right - but not a lot. It is a brilliant read, a lovely view, one that I would prefer would be dominate. But he is an author who wants to sell books and that is often best done by being disruptive, taking the opposing view and being controversial. We need people like Pink in the world to encourage corrective behavior when (in this case) people apply one particular model exclusive of all other considerations and approaches.<br /><br />My own firm belief is that in order to optimise motivation you have to apply some of Pink's view as a ingredient, like an onion in a soup - an onion does not make up a meal!<br /><br />From an Organisational Development perspective I try and think about basic motivation within roles that require cognitive function to be considerate of the three time-tested psychological concepts:<br /><br /> - Instinctual drives<br /> - Stimulus response<br />-  Shared intentions<br /><br />It might help for clarity to explain my view and own perspective:<br /><br />Instinctual drives - Nature or nurtured behavioral drivers are hard wired, hard to change, also influenced by culture or community - like a bird learning to fly or a cat wanting to hunt or our need to seek to satisfy Maslow's hierarchy of needs.<br /><br />Stimulus response - cause an effect, I avoid fire I don't get burnt, I eat I don't feel hungry, I work hard to achieve a goal - I get a rewarded, I don't achieve a goal - I don't get rewarded, I practice something - I get better at it, I work on this project (altruistic or otherwise) - I feel good helping.<br /><br />Shared intentions is about \\"fit and belonging to something to achieve something\\" - I want to be part of something great, I want to be on a winning team, I want to work with smart people to achieve something I'd value.<br /><br />I completely believe in the value of his \\"autonomy, mastery and purpose.\\" But when it comes to money pink missed the point, its not about the cash, it about how the cash (as an ingredient in the soup) helps to achieve our instinctual drives, eg; the need to fulfill our most basic fundamental needs; (Maslow's safety) provide for the family, health, shelter, food, even fun etc. Then stimulus response applies - I know if I achieve a goal I will be rewarded which will help me achieve some of my instinctual drives. If an employee's instinctual drives are not being fulfilled and they believe money will in part help resolve this - they become disengaged and leave for higher remuneration. Obviously there are other causal factors of instinctual drives not being met including how their manager treats them; whether they receive acknowledgement, respect, have the ability to create, solve problems etc. This is not debated by Pink.<br /><br />He mentions in his book countless studies to prove his theory - but the \\"countless\\" are not mentioned and there are many, countless studies demonstrating the alignment that cause and affect of having a range of rewards including amongst many; money aligned to the achievement of a goal to satisfy basic human needs and how this delivers value to an organisation. Its also important to note that most people don't grow up with the same experience as Pink, he had a privileged upbringing, he was a Truman scholar, Juris Dr from Yale, editor of the Yale Law review and was Al Gore's chief speech writer... He is one of the 1%. Money, the need for it and how it fulfills basic, fundamental needs is not something he truly understands.<br /><br />I believe Pink set out to write a best seller, he has brilliantly made a calculated, political attempt to tap into the anti-profit, anti-greed, wall street = bad sentiment that was prolific whilst writing Drive in 2009. I tell others to remember - he was Al Gore's chief speech writer and he was exceptional at it! But he has basically told us to eat the onion, not the soup.<br /><br />I'm giving this a bad review - not beacuse its not an interesting read but because just recently I had to try and convince an organisation that adopting his glossy \\"no cash incentive\\" approach would be disastrous for them and their environment. Applying \\"POP Leadership\\" like this is simply going to send a lot of businesses to the wall!<br /><br />Happy to debate further<br /><br />- John Me just recently I had to try and convince an organisation that adopting his glossy \\"no cash incentive\\" approach would be disastrous for them and their environment.

B004EPZ0AC|4.0|It is more than obvious that all the bad reviews were done by one hater , they are all in the same day and every \\"reviewer\\" has not history of reviews but this one. So yeah that was pretty stupid and amazon should delete them all.<br />Now onto the movie , it's true it wasn't as good as the first one ,but what sequel really is? so yeah it was good , the kids liked it and liked seeing a familiar character again, so that's what matters.

B0019IB0II|5.0|This is a book about survival after a stroke. It is a must read for any family, not just where a member has suffered from a stroke, but any family in which a stroke may strike and that means every family. Often, with the best intentions, we do the wrong thing, while the victim is trying to ask for the right type of help but cannot communicate. All strokes are not equal so the response must be appropriate. The most profound lessons are: give the victim time to respond, don't ask yes or no questions and don't finish their sentences for them. This a great work that deserves serious study.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a great book. I purchased it through Amazon for my Kindle. I have also purchased book 2 of the trilogy and plan on buying book 3 soon.

1442419814|3.0|The concepts and the heart are great--one might read it as a non-religious meditation on Proverbs 31:30 and 1 Peter 3:3. Maybe that's why it seems that so many Christian women seem to like this series.<br /><br />However, the writing isn't great. To be fair, it isn't horrifyingly ugly, but it isn't especially pretty, either.<br /><br />Writing: 3/5<br /><br />Plotting: 3/5<br /><br />Concepts & heart: 4/5

0857520652|4.0|Former stage actress and BBC Radio writer Rachel Joyce has fashioned a novel of personal discovery that will leave you emotionally invested from the very first chapter. Drawing on spiritual antecedents such as the well-known [[ASIN:0743453255 Forrest Gump]] and the less-known but equally relevant [[ASIN:098430813X Amazing Adventures of a Nobody]], The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a British walking adventure--\\"Life was very different when you walked through it.\\"--that offers descriptive prose with commensurately good dialogue. There's even a trail of [[ASIN:0877017883 Griffin & Sabine]]-like correspondence. The reveal is heartachingly shocking. Not until the final chapter does the scent go cold. I suspect the author was unsure how to tie off loose ends. In the real world, relationships are not always mended satisfactorily, and I would have preferred for art to imitate life in this case.<br /><br />>>Harold took the A roads, B roads, lanes and tracks. The compass quivered northward and he followed. He went by day or by night, as the mood took him; mile after mile after mile. If the blisters were bad, he bound them with duct tape. He slept when the need for it came, and then returned to his feet and walked again. He went under the stars, and the tender light of the moon, when it hung like an eyelash and the tree trunks shone like bones. He walked through wind and weather, and beneath sun-bleached skies. It seemed to Harold that he had been waiting all his life to walk.&lt;&lt;<br /><br />[The reviewer was provided with a complimentary copy of the book.]
0345803485|5.0|I saw the review on Ellen and new I had to get this book. I have just started reading it and it is hard to put down. Thank you!
0553801473|3.0|I have read through many of these reviews and most of them have a consensus... One in which I agree with.<br /><br />I started with A Game of Thrones and read all the way to the end of A Dance with Dragons. A long and testing quest... with many characters and many stories. And now that I have completed all 5 that have been released-- I have to voice my opinion.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones: 5/5 of stars.<br />A Clash of Kings: 4.5/5 stars<br />A Storm of Swords: 4/5<br />A Feast for Crows: 2.5/5 (My least favorite book... Cersei just rubbed me the wrong way and she was in it way too much.)<br />A Dance with Dragons: 3/5<br /><br />George R R Martin is a fantastic writer... one who can create worlds with such elegance that is just unreal. But I feel like that A Dance with Dragons; the counterpart to A Feast for Crows, just dragged on and did not have much action in it. A few good \\"Oh man!\\" parts that I saw in the first three books but just not enough. Martin is keeping us waiting... and waiting... and waiting... for something to happen. Not much does here.<br /><br />My advice: Make sure you got lots of time, caffeine, and patience to make it through A Dance with Dragons. I was disappointed in this ok but not so grand book.<br /><br />I love you Martin but lets make The Winds of Winter the book we cant put down... we all need it.

1592332803|3.0|This book's strong points are also its weak points, depending on what your priorities are. As other reviewers have mentioned, the author generally makes simple substitutions from standard baking - usually margarine for butter and ener-g or tofu for eggs. The upside of this 'lowest common denominator' style of vegan baking is that it's very easy and inexpensive to find substitutes, and it won't alter your routine too much if you're used to standard baking. Still, it reminds me of a vegan cookbook that gives 'meat and potatoes' recipes with just tofu or seitan instead of the meat, in that it wears out its usefulness and gets boring pretty quickly. It helped me when I began baking vegan goodies, although I never really baked with eggs and dairy (I didn't know how to bake, period, before I bought this book to start learning). The sections that explain how to make substitutions and how leavening and binding agents work were helpful, but I imagine that other books or websites give similar information.<br /><br />I consider this book a decent buy if you want to make sweets as close to their egg- and dairy-containing counterparts and possible, with minimum substitution; this is especially handy if you're baking to share with people who might be leery of chocolate cake made with zucchini or something such. It also doesn't ask you to use chickpea and spelt flour and other expensive, hard-to-find ingredients that are so annoyingly common in vegan recipes (there is an over-reliance on 'pure maple syrup', however; does she not know how prohibitively expensive that stuff is? I use agave instead). If you really want to save your money, I recommend using vegan recipe websites and blogs rather than buying this book. Great ones to try include the Post-Punk Kitchen, Vegan Dad, Fat-Free Vegan Kitchen, and No-Meat Athlete; they don't have the same baking substitution tutorials as a cookbook (at least, not that I know of), but they generally have great basic recipes as well as more varied, innovative ones...plus, it's free and the commenters often give nifty tips and tricks. For the record, this author publishes recipes on her website too, but you have to pay for a subscription to access them. I don't necessarily fault her for it (she has to pay the bills too), but I'd rather try out the recipes that authors offer for free...then buy their cookbooks if they're good. Thank you, Isa Chandra Moskowitz!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I first picked up this book, the writing drove me crazy. It's obvious that the author didn't do enough research about the way American 20-something people talk. But the more I read, the more I got used to the author's voice and in the end I enjoyed the book and will be reading the next one in the series.
B006ZCWTFG|5.0|!I do not currently own this! (I do now, see update) I write this only to encourage amazon to provide us lovers of vinyl albums more details about the products.  I have seen on other websites that this is offered in a brown limited edition (150 hand numbered) and a clear LE (350 hand numbered) LP.  As I type this the description on Amazon merely states [Limited Edition].  Which one is it?  Is it either?<br />Also please provide a category for all LP's that informs the consumer as to whether or not the LP includes a link to a downloadable digital version of the album.  I am more likely to purchase a product that provides a link to a lossless digital version of the album included with the LP.<br />I will purchase this and update my review (change the rating) accordingly after receiving it.  If I do not see a better description for LP's in the future I will consider shopping elsewhere for my vinyl fix.  Thank you.<br /><br />***Update 6/15/12***<br />I actually drove around looking for the LP.  Spent a whole day trying to find this and ETID \\"Ex Lives\\" on vinyl.  One distributor said their version of Ex Lives (LP) comes with the limited edition CD inside the record sleeve but they didn't have any in.  Another distributor had no idea.  I think in the future I'll deal with this fantastic little ma & pop record store I discovered.  They'll order it for me then if it's not what I want I'll just pass.  The owner seems like good people and to me that is part of the music experience.  Good people.<br /><br />After I saw a clip from the included DVD (Deluxe Digipak Edition CD) I decided to purchase that.  Plus I saw the LE vinyl doesn't come with a link to an mp3 version of the LP or as some other artist's have made available a link to a lossless version.  No tube amps.  No horns.  Highly processed sound and that's not a bad thing with a band like Meshuggah (they show their recording method in the DVD which is great!).  Because of this I thought I'd probably prefer the cd anyways.  As I originally stated \\"I will purchase this and update my review (change the rating) accordingly after receiving it.\\"  I see a couple people have commented and I understand were they are coming from.  I despise it when someone rates an item without owning it.  Perhaps they erroneously thought I was an inept intellectual lightweight.  Perhaps they didn't notice I had written I'd purchase then update my review accordingly.  It was one of those hurricane me days.  Reviews on Amazon have been a great method for communicating with both manufacturers as well as distributors as I have found in the past they watch these reviews closely.  I also consider things like handling times, packaging, accurate information, and the overall purchasing experience to be valid in an amazon review.  Those considerations would not be applicable in say a Rolling Stone or Spin magazine review which I believe some may confuse these Amazon reviews for.  For what it's worth I believe the brown, the white, and if they made them I can't remember clear LE vinyl Koloss are long sold out so I'm going to speculate and say the ones being sold here might be black vinyl.  That's not a bad thing.  Speculative though.<br /><br />Koloss's audio CD is great.  I am beginning to heal and am training again.  When I absolutely, positively have to destroy everything in my way... I reach for a Koloss.  It's brutal.  It's intelligent.  It's precise. It does not lie.  I feel a chaotic calm wash over me when I listen to Koloss.  The energy is there and easily accessible but not overwhelming.  Controllable.<br />Comes with a foldout containing lyrics on one side and album art on the other.  One might call it a poster.<br /><br />Koloss's DVD is a fantastic addition.  It gave me a new appreciation for not just the music but also the people involved in bringing the Meshuggah experience to us, live as well as recorded.  Two options greet you at the main menu.  \\"Konstrukting The Koloss\\" and \\"Meshuggah In India.\\"  Konstrukting the Koloss takes you into the studio with Meshuggah.  You are briefed by the band members on the tools of their trade down to the drumsticks.  One moment they are speaking Swedish.  The next moment perfect english.  I got the sense that these guys work hard at being masters of their craft.  The results are validating.<br /><br />Meshuggah In India; At The Gates Production.  I found it to be a rather humbling portrait of hardworking small business owners.  Like the album this short documentary does not lie.  Nobody acts for the camera.  It is not flashy or glamorous.  It's subjects do not ramble on incoherently about obtuse subjects.  It was done right and is a nice addition to the album.<br /><br />I am out of time.  Just want to say that I will keep an eye out for the release date of Meshuggah's next LP.  See if they are going to do another LE LP printing.  I'll have to catch one of their shows too.  Maybe in India.  Scratch two items off the list.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I don't typically write reviews for books.  But I feel compelled to write a review on this book because I honestly cannot understand how the book received so many glowing reviews.  I got the book because of the overwhelmingly positive number of reviews.  It had to be good, right?  Wrong.  The reviews were misleading.  After I read the book, I went back and found the negative reviews.  For the most part, they are right on.  First, I felt like both the character development and relationship development lacked depth and authenticity.  Then there's the complete lack of believability.  I don't read books expecting the story to be completely realistic, but I just cannot suspend my disbelief as much as this book required.  I also share some other reviewers concerns that this book seems to be a young adult book but contains a surprising amount of violence without consequences and glorifies a seriously unhealthy relationship.  I could go on with specifics but I don't want to spoil things for anyone who wants to read the book.  All that being said, I was able to finish the book, so it's not completely hopeless.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have always loved this game and its the real one not a fake. It is very fun but drains your battery very quickly. In less than an hour it drained more than 10% of my power. Even if you don't play this game it still drains your power. Otherwise it is a good game to pass time and doesn't need wi-fi. If you really like this game I would still get it. If you unstall this app you don't have to pay again to install it. Have fun!
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|This movie was nowhere near as good as they said it was. Sure, it sounds good on paper, when you read the reviews, the preface, the plot, the 'synopsis', but the movie itself... it's, uh, good, but only good.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane (A lot of thought must have gone into that name), a failed baseball player who becomes a highly regarded manager. However his team, the Oaklands A's are at the bottom of the team ladder, and they are under threat for survival in the league. With a name like the A's they very much deserve to be out of the competition, but anyway.<br /><br />There's a lot of scenes where old men (selectors) sit around a table talking about who had a good swing, commanding posture and all, and then Billy Beane just starts yelling at them like Brad Pitt is still in his 'Inglorious Bastards' character, or maybe he's trying to be Tom Cruise in 'A Few good men'. Then Jonah Hill's stereotypically nerdy character comes along with a way of determining who has good 'stats'. Billy then tries to put a team together based on the stats - much to the chagrin of the old selectors. It's like tradition versus the new way of doing things. Eventually Billy starts putting his team together. At first they lose, but after a while they win. All that stuff is interesting, worth the hype.<br /><br />But about half-way through there's a diversion - an unheralded diversion that no critic warned you of - that delves into Billy Beane's private life. There's all these scenes where he drives around in his car looking sad and sometimes thumping the steering wheel. Then there's meeting his ex-wife's new man, who starts talking about what 'improvements' can be made to the daughter's up-bringing, which is when Billy recites the line, yes you guessed it 'She's MMYYY daughter' - which is all fine and good, except that it's a line that has been in every stinkin movie for the past ten years, like 'Thank you for smoking' and 'The Weatherman;. And watching him spending that 'quality time' with his (predictably 'troubled') daughter... whew! that's just cringe inducing.<br /><br />Towards the end Billy is having all these emotional episodes, which seem forced. You get the impression he's 'had it' with baseball, he's over it. That's hardly a good sign, seeing this is a 'baseball' movie. But right at the end the manager of another team tells him some good news, and you realise 'it was all worth it in the end' - which is kind of like watching this movie, you get some brilliant moments, your bad bits, but it was all worth it in the end; although Pitt is intent on playing his characters neurosis to the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a quick and entertaining read. I would not recommend this book for kids under 12 as some parts are very violent.

B0000DYKET|5.0|I got a pair of Neport sandals this spring and have been using them for 2-3 months now. I couldn't make up my mind if I should buy these or the \\"Newport H2\\" model. The difference seems to be that the H2 is using some \\"water friendlier\\" material than leather for the outer layer and the H2 have 100% rubber sole while the Newport have some leather upper layer on the sole that makes it more comfortable.<br />I chose the Newport because I thought I was going to use them occasionally for 'street use' but if I could make the choice again I would probably select the H2 because apparently I see to use them only for hiking. The leather layer does not even come in contact with your feel anyway so I'm not really sure what's the point.<br /><br />These sandals are great! Here's what I like about them:\<br />* super comfortable. You can wear them all day and never feel the need to take them off.<br />* Hold your feet very well. I haven't tried super difficult trails but I have tried dry trails, creeks, boulders, you name it. They just won't quit.<br />* Sole has very good grip. They do not slip and slide even when wet.<br />* toe protection is great<br />* nice reflective stripes on front and back<br />* it takes a second to wear them or take them off<br /><br />They are not perfect though:<br />* they take a longer to dry when they get soaking wet then I would have expected<br />* they are a bit on the heavy side. I was surprised when I first lifted them out of the box. But you get used to this<br />* the price you pay for the good hold and grip is I guess some less air. When it's really hot outside, your feet will get a bit warm. These are no flip flops...<br /><br />Note that I had to pick up size 9. I normally wear 8 or 8.5 max.

B005LAII0I|5.0|Though it has all the elements of previous versions (such as the poisoned apple and magic mirror) this retelling of Snow White took the story in a different direction. Basically, the queen wants the prince, who starts out as a bit of a jerk, but he is in love with Snow White who is left in the woods where she is taught how to fight and steal by the seven little men who do not work in a mine.<br /><br />The new twist is refreshing after seeing the same story told over and over again. Some of the humor is more adult then previous versions, but there is still enough comedy to keep kids entertained. (Though some of the black magic parts might scare very small children.)<br /><br />Overall, I greatly enjoyed this film. It is not mean to be overly serious or even overly silly. It is just a good family film that I can't wait to get on DVD.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Great App.  A very fun game. You play with your friends. Must have app for your kindle fire. I LOVE IT. Wont be disappointed.
B005LAZIRY|3.0|Sigh with me for a moment if you're a longtime fan of this band *sigh*<br /><br />I have to let out a breath before I say this: Opeth has released an album I don't like. Trust me when I say I don't like saying that any more than you like hearing it, but it's true. I discovered Opeth when I was 14, the same time \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" was released to such critical acclaim. It became as legendary for me as Death's \\"Symbolic\\". Ever since, Opeth has done no wrong. They've only EVER improved and none moreso than with \\"Watershed\\". I'm probably one of the few old school fans who thinks \\"Watershed\\" beats even \\"Still Life\\" or their other greats as their all time best work. You can see in my review of it my reasons, but basicly it's because the band is now full of members that perfectly compliment Mikael's writing style and his sense of direction musically. They're all skilled, but tasteful and \\"Watershed\\" was an absolutely perfect blend of Opeth styled-death metal, progressive metal, and classic rock riffs that hit you in the soul.<br /><br />\\"Heritage\\" isn't bad persay because it steps away from the direction set forth in \\"Watershed\\". We have yet to even see whether this was just a footnote in the history of the band or the true direction and I trust it is just that, an experimental indulgence on Mikael's behalf in part because he now has bandmates like Axe who can(or want) to play this jazz-infused style of music. For this reason I try not to judge too harshly.<br /><br />The thing is that he did this before with \\"Damnation\\" and it was good. Damn good. It was basicly soft/unplugged Opeth. The style of music was consistent with their catalogue and tonality. This album is not in a lot of ways. Now this, again, isn't why I fault it either. The main reason I fault it is because there are only a handful of tracks really worth listening to. \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" is obvious and, having been the track they previewed on FB before release, seems to have been a good indicator of the direction, but it's not. Most of the rest of the album is very, VERY soft. There are gorgeous acoustic passages I love, but then they're driven into obscurity by drumless sections of Mikael's melodious singing and soft keys. Then you'll hit another amazing song like \\"H&auml;xprocess,\\" probably my favirote that mixes the best jazz time signatures they've ever created with thumping bass that gets your head moving and acoustic guitar riffs that literally chill your spine with their undistorted metalness(even as I type and listen to it for reference) only to be haulted by another soft track that stops the album dead.<br /><br />But there are only 4-5 tracks I *really* like. I can't emphasize enough how the great tracks shine, but then the other ones drag it down so hard after the momentum build-up from the great songs, it's like starting on track 1 again. I think this album could have almost benefitted from a A-side and B-side setup with these more traditional songs having been 1-5 and the softer ones being 6-10 if just for the fact it would tell me that they recognize the jarring direction the tracklist takes.<br /><br />I will leave you with this. Mikael once said he can't even listen to \\"Orchid\\" or \\"Morningrise\\"(moreso the former) because it's such trash in his eyes. I'm starting to wonder if he has aged so far musically that he looks back on the era of \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" or \\"Blackwater Park\\" the same way because he's not just making small changes. Their last album was undeniably Opeth in every way, shape, and form. This one, if played for a non-fan besides these other albums is potentially 100% distingushable as being from another group. Opeth has been my favirote band for over 15 years now and I refuse to say they \\"suck\\". They don't. Anyone saying this is ignorant to music. I will merely say I do not have the urge to pop this cd in at all compared to their other material. This is after trying ever since it's release as well. I gave this album a *very* long chance before reviewing it. I hope they return with something like \\"Watershed\\" next, but time will tell.efore reviewing it.

0374275637|5.0|Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Daniel Kahneman tells us that we use intuition all the time--and often well--to make daily decisions. But sometimes, even at important times, we use intuition and make very bad and harmful decisions. Getting up in age these days, Kahneman appears to have written this opus magnum as a great compilation of his research and that of his much admired academic partner, Amos Teversky (now deceased).  A leader in psychology and specifically decision making and behavioral economics, Kahneman explores two systems of how we think. System 1 is the quick-to-judge, emotional, and intuitive thinking system we all seem to possess and use often. System 2 is the slower, more deliberate and logical kind of thinking we also all possess. Kahneman profiles the amazingly fast and omnipresent power and influence of intuitive thinking...both its profound contribution to daily life and its hidden traps when making big decisions too quickly--fueled by the biases of System 1 thinking. He shows how anchoring, loss aversion, and various cognitive biases can powerfully affect our decision making at home, at work and in the marketplace. At the same time, he introduces us to the slower, more logical, and more deliberate partner, System 2, and how it can be used to moderate, even mitigate, the flaws in the fast-thinking System 1. In essence, he helps us understand when and where to use each of these systems to maximize our outcomes. His bottom line advice: When we make important decisions, we need to slow down.<br /><br />Reviewed in depth over the next two weeks on Survival Leadership Blog.

1579128149|5.0|I bought this book at Costco's.  It was an impulse buy but it ended up being my son's absolute favorite book.  This book can't be out of his sight for too long before he gets upset.  He will go a few days without seeing it, but then will be right back to it.  He reads it over and over again and every time, he learns more.  He has really developed a passion for the elements and this book has kept it's place above all others that I have bought or gotten from the library for him.  I honestly would love him to get more books with more information, but he is just in love with this one.  Oh, he is 9 years old, 10 soon.  But has had this book for a good year or more now.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great read, kept my interest. The author's development of characters made them come alive. I didn't like the ending......and at one point knew what was coming before the end of the book. So that part I didn't like.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun, cute for the kids<br />lots of reading though for younger kids<br />easy enough even if not a good reader<br />would recommend
0375424474|3.0|Had I read this book years ago it would have gotten 4 stars. It is easy read and well written. I do think that Shubin's sense of humor comes across better in his lectures than in the book, but having seen his talks I had an idea of his delivery, so that helped.<br /><br />Another reviewer (on another site) had noted that this book assumes you already accept evolution and that observation is dead-on. Here's the problem though. The book has an overview feel to it with some nice nuggets of interesting information, but it never seems to dig into anything too deeply. I also felt the illustrations were a bit lacking. So, if I were to not know anything of evolution, but had nothing against it, then this would be a good first or second book on the subject. However, to assume one already accepts evolution seems to make me feel as though one would already have some knowledge of many of the examples provided. Even if the reader didn't know these particular examples, they certainly would have accepted them quickly at the depth presented and would likely want more data/ examples/ technical info.<br /><br />In other words, the book's depth and content seems written for an audience with only a precursory knowledge of evolution, but at the same time assumes the audience has knowledge enough of evolution to accept it in the first place, and therefore the book doesn't provide enough detail.<br /><br />I do not mean to take anything away from the book and do feel it should be on every science fan's bookshelf, but I wish I would have read this when I was in high school biology because it would have made for interesting conversation and questions.
B0086700CM|5.0|Game is fun and addicting!  The upgrades are fairly decently spaced so it allows the game to take on new challenges as you go along to keep it interesting.

0743277708|5.0|I sent this book to a granddaughter because when my son entered Prep School it was the first thing on his required reading list. I read it myself back then and thoroughly enjoyed it. How little I knew about rabbits before that. [[ASIN:0743277708 Watership Down: A Novel]]
159562015X|4.0|I find myself way behind the norm, since I have never taken the Strength Finder Assessment, until now.  Tom Rath takes years of research through Gallup and makes it applicable to the man on the street.  The book is short and an easy read with interesting stories to help the reader understand the author's points.  The majority of the book covers the 34 strength themes and ideas for action for each of them.<br />The assessment gives you your top five strengths and the identical information on ideas for action the book gives.  I have always believed a team approach to leadership is best, and this book confirmed my assumption, but gave me the logic of how to best identify the members of my team, through their strengths.  I enjoyed the book, learned something new about myself, and gained some new awareness for working with other people.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|There's an awful lot to criticize about this book.  Yes, the premise is preposterous, even taken only as allegory.  Yes, the plot is juvenile, predictable, contrived and packed with annoying cop outs, including but not limited to a deus ex machina that's nonsensical and unnecessary in equal measure.  On the other hand, though just barely compensating for these shortcomings, the story is undeniably entertaining and well-paced.  If nothing else, the author has certainly tapped into the psyche of the modern reality show-addled young adult.  Without divulging spoilers, here's a representative excerpt that recurs often both literally and thematically:<br /><br />\\"The crowd goes berserk.\\"<br /><br />Of course it does.

B001KTATIS|4.0|The film is older and for evident reason I doubt they will ever re-master it.  But the quality of this disc is not bad. Some have said it was grainy but I think it is the best we will see.  There are Spanish instructions on the main menus but the audio is in English.. subtitles in Spanish.  The film is a bit gawdy but historically accurate.  If you are a fan of the film... this is an excellent purchase at an excellent price.

B00579EL18|4.0|Musically and artistically, this performance is great. It may have its drawbacks, for instance, The Great Inquisitor is certainly not the best part for Hermann Uhde, who was one of the best Wagnerian baritones. Rysanek may be slightly off the peak of her glory... Such details, however, are easily outweighed by the overall greatness of this interpretation of Don Carlo. Not everybody may like it, of cause. It is very stern, very dark and how to but it, explicitly non-Italianite (with Elisabetta sung by one of the best Sieglindes of the century and Eboli by a splendid Kundry). A friend of mine  who happened to drop in when I was listening to the CD even asked me what was the Wagnerian opera I was listening to =) But the recording is great, both singing and performance. As to Corelli, it is possibly his greatest Carlo, as one of the reviewers has already pointed out.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of terrible cuts. I will never forgive the frustration of the moment I realized that my favourite moment of the final duet was missing... Strangely enough, Adler had already conducted a fuller version of Don Carlo, and it was recorded live in 1955. If you like Adler's style you really should consider that recording, it is brilliant.

B007ZMFL5K|3.0|I have 10 recordings of this symphony.  This new Rattle/Berlin PO recording is quite good.  Of course, this is a new recording of the world best Berlin PO.  My favorite recordings of this symphony are Gunter Wand/BPO (or Munich PO);  Carlo Maria Giulini/VPO, and  Jochum/Staatskapelle Dresden.<br /><br />Does this unfinished symphony really need this 4th movement version?  I love this symphony's \\"Farewell\\" 3rd movement.  As Bruckner himself mentioned,  playing his Mass No. 3 after this unfinished work makes sense to me.  I would rather hear his 3rd Mass, eg. a little controversial recording by Celibidache, Munich PO after listening to the common 3rd movement.
1594202842|4.0|Gandhi once said \\"My life is my message.\\" That remained in my mind as I read this book. If Chua's life is her message, she is teaching others that they should rule by tyranny, treat children with no respect, pay an unlimited amount of money for their success (buy their success), forget about happiness being a part of life, and snub the culture of a country that has afforded her to live a life of privilege. She runs a communist home in the land of the free. She is miserable and makes everyone else around her miserable as well. She calls others selfish and cruel, while not seeing how she has set such an example. She says that we Westerners are raising janitors, when the truth is that the vast majority of those living under the Chinese parenting style grow up to work in factories, making cheap products for Americans (their average hourly salary is $.75). Plus, China has one of the highest rates of suicide in the world and it is the leading cause of death of those ages 15-34. I find Chua to be an abusive parent who treats her children like trophies. Having said all that, I think the book is worth reading because it teaches us something about the world. It teaches us that there are such people out there, people who care more about status than happiness, love, and peace, and what we should strive to not do as parents. I sincerely hope that Lulu grows up to write a memoir.

I then read the fairy tales to 5th graders that had been studying fairy tales to get their take on them - they loved them!<br />I know that this will be a book I go back to again and again - such a great story!

B006OCM0G0|1.0|Yes this game is fun and addictive when you first start playing it, but I noticed as time went on I was not receiving my money for food or my XP.  How can you cook more food or decorate if you are not receiving money?! The decorations items are too expensive!  After playing for 6 months the problems just became not worth it to play the game any more.  Even after repeatedly emailing teamlava support nothing was done.  There have many complaints about this game.  Check out the teamlava forum and you will see.

0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau is well-known for his desire to go to every country on the planet before his 35th birthday (on track to do so), and his website, The Art of Non-Conformity.  At the website, he offers up travel wisdom and products to help his readers make the jump from corporate slave to entrepreneur.  His latest book is an expansion on this idea.<br /><br />The book is well-written and easily understood; more conversation than how-to.  He makes the idea of starting your own business - any type of business - not only palatable but eminently do-able.  Chris gives not only the example of his own life, but many case studies and anecdotes from real-life entrepreneurs such as the well-known Grammar Girl.  He offers up a framework of how to get started, for very little money, how to keep the business going and growing, and even what happens if you (should) fail.  The illustrations, done by artist Mike Rohde, are well-done and fit the flavor of the book to a T.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a follower of Pam Slim, or are thinking of striking out on your own, this book is for you.  If you just want to flirt with the idea of going into business for yourself, this book is worth reading, if only to fire you up.  And if you are a fan of Chris Guillebeau, this book is a must-read.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I now see what all the fuss is about. These books are incredibly gripping, original, and thought-provoking. As you probably know by now, the book follows Katniss Everdeen, whose life is changed forever when she volunteers in her sister's place to fight to the death against children from all around the country of Panem on national television. Panem is a futuristic version of America, and the leaders created the annual Hunger Games to keep the country together by reminding citizens of the consequences of rebelling.<br /><br />Katniss is a tough nut, who is believably scarred by her many difficult experiences in life. Her beloved father died, and she assumed a carer role for her mother and sister. Her best friend, Gale, hunts with her in the 'free' woods outside her home and they develop a strong bond that might be love. She also may be in love with her co-participant in the Games, Peeta. However, Katniss' world is so dark that love is the least of her problems.<br /><br />I found the messages in the books - about governments, media, greed, and reality entertainment to be relevant and disturbing. Katniss' world is not SO different from our world, and that's a bit scary. However, we're still a ways from it. This series is in the tradition of Children of Men, Bladerunner, and other post-apocalyptic stories. If you like these kinds of stories, you'll like The Hunger Games trilogy<br /><br />For the record, I didn't notice any major formatting issues as the previous reviewer did. If there were any, I was so entranced by the story that I didn't notice.

0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a powerful story about forgiveness, guilt and finding a place called home. As well as the meanings flowers hold.<br /><br />The story is told through the main character, Victoria. It starts on her eighteenth birthday as she leaves her old life at a group home and entering a new life as an adult to fend for herself. But she has not relied on anyone but herself for years and seeks a life of solitude. After not finding work, she spends some time homeless finding solace with her love. Her love of flowers. Until she learns she cannot survive without food and shelter. She then proves her knowledge as well as talent with flowers in front of a florist and begins working for her. While working, she meets a man who begins sending her messages with flowers. Only the two of them seem to know the forgotten language of flowers that was popular in the Victorian era. While conversing with the man with flowers, she is reminded of someone from her past and how she learned the language in the first place. Only this is something that has haunted her for years and she has never come to terms with. She has been running from it for years but can run no longer.<br /><br />The story flashes from the present to the past throughout the book allowing the reader to you see the complete picture closer to the end. Victoria's life was a hard one and the past has affected the woman she is in the present. The audience gets to see her love of flowers as she reestablishes the language of flowers in the present era and more importantly what the flowers represent to her in her various stages of life.<br /><br />Vanessa Diffenbaugh did a brilliant job portraying people especially our flaws. This is a heartfelt story about dealing and facing the past. Victoria's view was shown so well you felt what she felt and hurt alongside her. I enjoyed seeing her character grow and imagining the woman she will one day be. It was also a look into how our lives/past shape our characters for better or worse and the importance of having someone by our sides that never give up on us. One of Victoria's main flaws is one we all have. Sometimes we don't truly see ourselves. The self image a lot of people have is much lower than it should be. It was important at one point in this novel for her character to realize how other people saw her and that they saw goodness.<br /><br />Even, though this is a different style book than I usually read, I loved it. I'm so glad I read it. I enjoyed reading what the flowers meant and the story seemed so real to me. Not far-fetched like some. This book actually made me cry it was so good. You know the author's done something right when the story starts the waterworks not because one of the characters died but because there is just so much emotion in the story. If you want a story that makes you feel, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone who wants a great story, a heartfelt plot or an interest in flowers.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br />\\"It's kind of ironic, don't you think?\\" he asked.<br />\\"Here you are, obsessed with romantic language-a language invented for expression between lovers-and you use it to spread animosity.\\"<br /><br />\\"Common thistle is everywhere,\\" she said. \\"Which is perhaps why human beings are so relentlessly unkind to one another.\\"<br /><br />*Although I won a free copy of this book through a Goodreads first reads giveaway, my review is not altered.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|This text was made for TV. Written from too many perspectives to keep count, the narrative can be a tad dry & convoluted. Even so, there's no mystery about why HBO would buy into it as a series. There are so many opportunities for colorful costuming & special effects. The best part about reading it is spoiling it for those who watch it on TV.

B007GP1CC2|5.0|2007: EMI issued a 17 CD box, \\"Jacqueline DuPre: The Complete EMI Recordings\\"  - [[ASIN:B000V9P4YM Jacqueline Du Pr&eacute; - The Complete EMI Recordings]]<br />2012: EMI issues a 17 CD box, \\"Jacqueline DuPre: The Complete EMI Recordings\\" - [[ASIN:B007GP1CC2 Jacqueline Du Pre: Complete EMI Recordings]]<br /><br />Either box is a worthy tribute to the great cellist, but there is a slight, though annoying, difference between them.<br />CD 17 of the 2012 box has one track that was not in the 2007 box:<br /><br />[8] J.S.Bach Adagio & Allegro from Sonata in D for Cello & Harpsichord, BWV 1028 (4:35) with Ronald Kinloch Anderson playing harpsichord.<br /><br />This was recorded in July, 1962 and was part of DuPre's first LP for EMI (an abum of encores with assorted accompanists).<br />EMI forgot to include it in the 2007 box.<br />It was not \\"lost\\".<br />EMI just forgot it.<br /><br />They have now corrected their mistake, which is a good thing, but it seems like an insult to those who bought the 2007 box.<br />EMI should have issued the new CD 17 as a single at a specially reduced price.<br />The new box does cost about half of what the old box cost, which makes it a bit less painful.<br /><br />Other differences:<br /><br />1) On CD 1, the Delius Concerto is now on 5 tracks, instead of the single track of 2007. Sound is unchanged.<br />2) There are five additional photographs of Jacqueline DuPre.<br />3) There is a two-page timeline of her life.<br /><br />The article by Christopher Nupen that appeared in 2007 is reprinted in the new box.<br /><br />Typographical Error: On CD 9, the Allegretto in E flat, Hess 48 is mis-identified as Hess 84.*<br />This mistake is repeated from the 2007 box.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION: The new box is a great buy and deserves five stars. but if I had bought the old box in 2007, I would be more than a little annoyed.<br /><br />* For more information about the Hess catalog, as well as the Kinsky catalog (WoO) and the Biamonti catalog, go to lvbeethoven.com<br />Click on the American Flag (if you speak American), then click \\"music\\".lvbeethoven.com<br />Click on the American Flag (if you speak American), then click \\"music\\".

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Started this and couldn't put it down. The family drama and the courtroom drama were both so well done.  I don't agree with the reviews that felt the narrative dragged.  Quite the opposite, the pages flew by.  It's a very timely story as well, dealing with bullying, genetic predispositions, nature vs. nurture.  The family drama though, is timeless.  I would highly recommend this book.

The storyline is not as exciting as \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" but keeps you engaged until the very last page.  I do hope E. L. James decides to add more chapters to this trilogy as it was one of the best stories I have read in years!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome its crazy no game ive ever played can best this one a w s o m e
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Excellent movie. I was surprised when it didn't win Best Picture. Its worth seeing several times. The main character played his role very well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|cool game....after you figure out how to play. Send your friends and back them up well. Upgrade your weapons when you need to. Thank you Glu...Now I am hooked on this game.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|first use lucky charm to get additional coins. during game first upgrade samurai then use leadership points to summon allies.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever.  I love the thrill of being a character and feeling on the edge of surviving.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game ever since I got it I have not put it down. I keep going to try and unlock more games.
0143119680|3.0|it fell disappointingly short. The plot and basic story line are very interesting.  However, at 579 pages in trade paper back, the book was way too long. It lacked serious editing. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the details were just too much. I absolutely don't need to know about the main character's large collection of black pants. Also, how many times am I going to have to read that she can feel icicles on her face? Her appetite and the details of what she is eating do not interest me. What really topped it off for me in the displeasure department was the male protagonist, Matthew. How many times will I have to read about a domineering, possessive vampire boyfriend/husband? This type of relationship dynamic does not appeal to me at all!  I know he has instincts like a wolf or whatever, but does he have to treat her like a child? I have never read a book that took me so long to get through the last 100 pages. The ending didn't bother me as much as the other reviewers. They set it up for a sequel and I'm used to that by now with so many book series and movie sequels. The book itself bothered me and how it seemed disjointed at times. Almost like it took her a long time to write it and the beginning and middle was very different from the end. A friend lent me this book. I'm on the fence about whether I will read the second in the series. I really like Elizabethan history so perhaps I will give it a go. Maybe the author took some constructive criticism and got some editing for her second book.  I read that a movie will be made based on this book. Perhaps they will cut through all of the crap and the movie will actually be better than the book.
B000BW9VB6|5.0|This CD remaster is a major leap in sound over the previous release. The added tracks of different versions of songs are fun. If your a fan, its essential.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an awesome game i have been waiting on it to come for kindle fire and it finally has i play it every second of the day you should totally get this game. :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this game. It is tricky and amusing so it draws your attention for longer than a few plays. Makes you really think!!

B007R41E8O|5.0|The game is very good, puzzles, hidden objected, figure it out stuff.  The download issue was very long but I just let it go overnight and did.good.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I am really enjoying it so far. The zoom is fixed...pinch works to zoom in and out. The storyline in most of these games are cheesy and this is no different.  If you like these types of games this a good one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its wat more adicting than angry birds and a little more fun and exciting and that's for shore
B005I4JG80|5.0|I have a seven month old, I read this while she was about 5 1/2 months old, and wish I had read it sooner.  I really enjoyed it and have used some of the tips.  I also asked my husband to read it when I was done, he is enjoying it too.  Our baby girl is back to sleeping through the nights from some of the tips in this book, and so I am sure she appreciates it too.
0385535139|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and he is among my three favorite authors.  In \\"The Litigators,\\" Grisham  returns to the \\"can't put this one down\\" style of writing.  I didn't put it down.  Fortunately, I am retired and don't have a job to go to or I probably would have been fired.  I admit to missing a couple of meals though.  It's a wonderful book filled with great character development, well-paced courtroom scenes, and the old humor for which he is so famous.  I loved it!
B00004LN16|3.0|You can't go wrong with expectations from AC/DC...they deliver what you purchase, hard rock with loud bangin sound and tunes to keep you rockin while you drive and partyin, drinking
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Being the 5,268th person to review a book seems pointless, but I just wanted to get my 4 stars noted.  Yes, this book has graphic sex.  If that offends you, don't read it.  I enjoyed it.  It's not all smut.  Grey and Anastasia really love each other.  The writing could use a little more variety - everyone is always gasping, muttering and whispering everything they say.  But the author does know how to tell a story and keep you interested.  I had to buy book two five minutes after I finished book one!
B00008WT5J|4.0|This seems like a compilation album, though not titled, as these songs - hits for AC/DC, can be found on other albums or is it just that they got a bunch of great radio rock tunes on one album finally?
B00493E1GI|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the audio book narrated by Liz Gilbert, and I'm a Julia Roberts fan, so watching the movie seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately, this movie adaptation is really, really awful.  I forced myself to watch up to the weeping Richard scene at the ashram.  That was the final straw; totally out of character and not in the book.  Do yourself a favor, read the book and forget the movie.
B000084T18|5.0|Talk about an explosive Major debut, then here it is with 50 showing what many have already known...the man delivers words with a message and the beats supplied from Dre to keep the party going.
B0086700CM|5.0|Having Temple Run put on the Kindle Fire is the best thing that has ever happened to me (in the gaming world that is).
B00008WT5E|2.0|I like the band but this is not one of their best and it makes it so typical at times of trying to differentiate their albums and find what comes next
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun to play while sitting quietly on a Sunday afternoon. What makes it even better is it was a free download.
B00008BXJJ|3.0|Many complain about who they are, but you know what you will get with AC/DC...loud, bangin metal rock and that is ok for the heavy metal aficiondo...Rock On
0451196716|5.0|My introduction to Stephen King, The Long Walk, took me to places I had never before imagined. The one thing that I've found that I love about King is his ability to capture the both the good and the bad of human beings in the midst of a traumatic experience. I was disturbed to read that people not only allowed the children in this book to participate in such an event, but also cheered it on. I was captivated, disgusted, saddened, proud, excited, and terrified all at the same time. This is a book that I have verbally recommended to quite a few people, and one that I will probably read again.
B000002JNN|4.0|Not sure if a comeback album as some say, but they deliver a strong performance here with some strong tunes that stand out as hits in the AC/DC genre.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book after the third read through of the Fifty Shades trilogy.  The story line while a little predictable was a good one! I fell in love with Travis and his personality from the get go, and enjoyed seeing how it would unfold. I do recommend for a good summer read.  It will bring a smile to your face.
0142418471|5.0|because part of me just wants to respond to some of the other reviews. So let's get it out of the way: the book is absolutely for and about teenagers; real teenagers dealing with real feelings in a real world. It is also about the over-the-top, outrageously funny, amazingly wonderful, Tiny Cooper who is definitely and without a doubt GAY.<br />If you don't want your children to know about homosexuality, don't let them read the book. If your teenagers don't know about underage drinking, rock and roll, or masterbation (yeah, right) and you want to keep it that way, don't let them read this book. If you don't want your children to understand that people can be loved, admired, APPRECIATED for who they are (as opposed to who they love), don't let them read this book.<br />For the rest of the world, those who don't live under a rock or with their heads in the sand, this book is AWESOME! It's funny, witty, and thoughtprovoking. The characters are multi-faceted and deep. Both Will Graysons are wonderfully defined and realistic. If I had to find a flaw, it's that the world of Tiny Cooper is too liberal, too accepting. If the book were going for realism, that would be a problem; since it seems to me to be more about accepting oneself and others, it's works fine.<br />As a straight, adult, though admittedly liberal, mother I was more than happy to give this book to my 13 year old daughter to read and learn from. And she loved it as least as much as I did!
0385344228|4.0|This novel kept me entertained and engaged, and its characters remained on my mind during periods of interruption.  While other reviewers seem to have encountered a similar plot before, I had not, and therefore found the subject matter and storyline relatively fresh (particularly the unusual ending).  The author is good with language, and captures a depth of feeling that is refreshing and unusual in courtroom drama/thrillers; in this sense, he achieves something comparable to Scott Turow's better writings.<br /><br />Frankly, the novel is unnerving to read, because it validates the quiet uneasiness that increasingly pervades our national awareness - that we really don't know what is going on in the lives of our children.  It is with distressing stirrings of self-recognition that we witness the actions and inactions of the narrator and his wife in their roles as parents: ignoring and/or rationalizing the obvious in an effort to avoid household tension; consoling themselves with that old bromide, \\"that's just teenagers for you\\"; fooling themselves with the belief that simply loving a child is enough.  Although we too often pretend otherwise, this is not the country we grew up in, in which respect, kindness, and self-control were demanded in the classroom, and enforced beyond its walls by any competent adult neighbor, shopkeeper, or passer-by within earshot.  This book and Jodi Picoult's \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" are uncomfortable, but valuable, shots across the bow.<br /><br />That said, I cannot give the book full marks because of a certain awkwardness and improbability in its conception.  That this intelligent, active, apparently well-balanced couple could be so passive and clueless as parents was, for me, a tough sell.  I assume the author wanted them both to be likeable, and so spared us the sorts of characters in whom such incompetence might be consistent (e.g., greedy, career-obsessed people; country club social climbers addicted to the tennis court; alcoholics; drugged-out, overgrown hippies, etc.)<br /><br />Further, I do question the accuracy of the author's depiction of the operation of the criminal justice system in his state, and I take issue with his apparently allowing himself so much license in describing it.  I am not too proud to confess that I regard fiction as an enjoyable means of learning - about travel, science, technology, medicine, history.  I suspect that I am not alone in this tendency, and that there are readers who value courtroom novels as a means of adding to their store of information about the legal system.  I hope that Mr. Landay will consider, in future writings, that some readers may imbibe as factual his presentation of how things unfold during the course of criminal investigation and prosecution. To be fair to him, maybe that is how things are done in Massachusetts.  Seems doubtful, though.
0545265355|5.0|Very interesting and enjoyable book! Although I can see how this book is geared for teenagers, I still found it fascinating and thought provoking.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I am getting older and I need something to keep me active with the brain and this is that helps me.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game really is awesome. it is so adicting.  it seems really easy but it is not. it is kind of hard beacause. it is.
B0018RFLN0|5.0|I am a fan of the Cruise-MI franchise.  This is the first one, and is the best for me (as far as depth of relationships go).  It is action and thrilling, but doesn't rely exclusively on fancy effects (which don't look that fancy anymore :-)) but still are fun to see.  I love the Prague set and this film is what first put Prague on my list of places to visit (I have since had the pleasure).  Obviously, it's not epic, but in this category of film, I think it's great and have enjoyed MI:1 about a dozen or more times over the years.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting 4ever 4 this 2 come 2 kindle fire and now that it has I love it! Amazing app best app I have! Get it right now! its free! haha :)
B00881VLCE|3.0|I think this is a pretty good puzzle app. Just make sure that you save your game before closing otherwise you lose your puzzle. Big design flaw in my opinion.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I bought the kindle fire just fto read pdfs and for this app. I love google.reader and to have it in my kindle is just awesome.
0345803493|5.0|I have not been able to put this book down.  I just about done reading this.  I really liked this one because they go into more why he is like his.  But it also shows a intriguing relaship between the two main charactors.  can not wait to start reading the 3rd book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun so far. run out of energy to fast and takes to long to regain it. fix that and lets roll
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book did not know what it was about.  I really enjoyed reading it.  I do not understand what the book to do is about this book.  Yes it does go into bondage and other things but I think that it was tastefully done.  I am already reading the second book and can not put it down.  I love the two main characters Ana and Christian.  to me they are very intriguing and keep you wanting to know more about them.
B007URCTOG|4.0|i liked some of the details and the twist... finding out that the guy was even a more noble guy than you thought.  but still i kind of hoped to find out a bit more about the positive side of the  story about things progressing... felt like it ended to soon.
0345803485|5.0|I read all 3 books and loved them. I thought that the story was great. Alot of books now days don't have a story this one did. If all of E.L. James books are like this, I would love to read them. gain this is not just about sex it had a very good story.
B006LKY1A8|5.0|Who wouldn\\"t love any movie with Johnny Depp in it. Kate Winslet did a great job, well played. Although I've seen many of Johnny Depp's movies, this movie showed to me a more personal side of him. How he really is in reality. However, 2nd to none are his Pirates of the Carribean movies- how hilarious!!! Can't wait to see more of him.
1250000971|5.0|I an following this series, and this book is two fo four. I can't wait until the third installation comes out and I will buy it from Amazon, less expensive and available the 2nd day. Great service Amazon
B006G2124E|5.0|This is just the greatest movie ever. Such emotion.You get caught up in life's unfairness, yet reality.No one can watch this movie without crying at the end. The actresses playing each role made you feel as if you were there sharing the emotions.Such great performances, all should have won academy awards.Great stuff!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for the kindle fire version of this for a while. I would always play Temple Run on my friend's ipod. The only thing to complain about is the lag but, otherwise very fun and addicting.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This Kindle fire was for my wife,She tells me almost everyday how much she loves her Kindle fire, We do a lot of driving and it helps her to pass the time.<br />She tells me she couldn't live without it.

0156013983|4.0|Bought this because our professor of French specified this edition for use in her class.  Our ongoing assignment:<br />make note of all words we looked up in the bilingual sources (online or text);<br />note each word whose sound or appearance intrigued or charmed us;<br />note those words or phrases which to us seemed poetic.<br />So far (chapter 4) in my collection are dozens of the first, a handful of the second, but none of the third (je regrette, madame: je ne suis pas un po&egrave;te.  M. Villon bien sûr, moi jamais).<br />But we are only starting!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I deleted this app from my kindle fire. I want to put it back so I start over wit new pass and User then I'm not able to reinstall it. help viz I really love this game
B007CBEO20|5.0|If you want a great rock album to listen to, give this a try. This is a great band and is very underrated here in the U.S. Their big hit in the 80's, the Final Countdown, gives a false impression of this band. They are much more guitar rock oriented than this song would indicate. Hard rocking with great melody makes this album one to love for a long time.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm one of those people who have been waiting for the temple run... but it has some lags and doesn't move sometimes... plz fix it!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Does exactly what I wanted it to do, slightly boost the volume and bass of my Sony headphones from my IPod Touch when I'm on the treadmill.<br /> Although there  are already plenty of good reviews here on this amp, the main reason I decided to comment here is because I made the mistake of looking at the info below the description where it shows that many also buy the additional L9 connector.......NOT needed! I read the reviews for it, all seemed as though it was essential yet I tryed it several times with various types of music and without a doubt, the music sounds best with the included headphone jack cords. I returned the L9 connector as it had no advantage and the E6 actually had less bass and volume using it compared to the headphone outlet jack cord.<br /> So, if you're here buying the E6 amp, try it as-is before ordering the optional cable and save some money.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|cool but is tough w/o spending dough blab blab blab blab blab blah blah blah blah blah blah blah<br />blah blah blah blah
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is by far the best Mission Impossible movie I think they have made. The story weaves itself together really well. It is easy to see why J.J. Adams makes such great movies, and gets good actors in those movies. I hope they come out with another one with this cast. It will be a shame if they don't.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Tomorrow I receive my vinyl copy of this freaking awsome album.  I love the songs, the lead singer, the cover art and most of all, I love the fact that Slash avoids the BS and drama and just focuses on putting out amazing rock.  If there was a church of rock, Slash would be the minister and in him, the rock gods would be mightely pleased.
0061564893|1.0|I just started this book, within the first twenty pages there's  mention of the corn supply to Nanjing being cutoff in 1356..... What a joke, I'm sad, I had looked forward to reading it and now I see I've wasted my money, unless corn means something other than Maize.

0345803507|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy. I've read them three times and each time it's just as good as this first. The story behind all the heavy stuff is beautiful. Once you pick them up you won't want to put them down until you're done!!!!

B004IAKU9O|4.0|My girlfriend has been raving about this movie for quite a while, so we curled up one rainy evening and watched it. Great movie for snuggling! :D
078322933X|3.0|Back when Mark Wahlberg was morphing from \\"Marky Mark\\" the rapper/underpants model into an A-list actor, he made this movie about a creepy, psycho-obsessive violent kid who falls in love with teenage Reese Witherspoon. When she tries to back off from the relationship, he decides to terrorize her family.<br /><br />The movie is formulaic and predictable, but it also has some pretty good scenes. Reese's character is a typical high school girl trying to assert her independence.  When her dad picks up on some disturbing signals The Boyfriend is sending out, he tries every trick in the book to discourage her from continuing to date the young man.  As every parent of teens knows, the best way to ensure that a relationship will become more committed is to DISAPPROVE of it, loudly and often. That's why, when your adolescent/young adult brings home a person who gives you the creeps, you play the role of supportive, loving parent totally enamored of the new interest, until your kid (hopefully) comes to his or her senses.<br /><br />Anyway. You just know bad things will happen, and they do.<br /><br />It is interesting that religion is only ever mentioned in movies if religion is central to the story (ie, \\"Sound of Music\\" and \\"Black Narcissus\\") or if it's a negative trait--another red flag that the religious person is a nutcase. In this film, there is absolutely no evidence of anyone having any sort of faith life, until we see the inside of The Boyfriend's room. He has a crucifix prominently displayed, and there are a few other religious items. This did not add to the story, except to underscore the fact that this character was a loon. I just think that's gratuitous.<br /><br />\\"Fear\\" is an okay movie, but if you watch it when you're in your house alone, make sure you activate your ADT system.
