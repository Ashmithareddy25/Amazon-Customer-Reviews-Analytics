0465092756|5.0|Woit's  book will be very helpful to technical people who do not work daily in the field of physics but want to remain up to date on the progress of this field.  Woit's conclusions and recommendations will be widely accepted. Interestingly,  in my book review of Leonard Susskind's book on The Cosmic Landscape in December  2005, I said, \\"I hold hopes for physicists but not much for strings.\\" I made this statement because the length of a string is divisible and cannot be modeled by a zero-point.  So, string theory was completely wrong on day one.<br /><br />Woit gave me a clear view of the histories of particle physics, strings, and the standard model.  In Ch. 6, my mind became glued to the Yang-Mills theory and the new behavior named `asymptotic freedom.' This new behavior is consistent with other theories: (1) the infinite gap that separates a creator God from the universe; (2) the Riemann hypothesis on prime numbers; (3) the true atoms (Leibniz's monads); (4) Cantor's transfinite number; (5) and the origin of inertia of Bernard Haisch (see  `The God Theory).  So, Woit is right.  It is time for physicists to return to basics and The Standard Model.  But, they might also consider the reality of an active  God.

B00008G9JO|5.0|I've owned a vinyl version of HEAVY HORSES since my college days (late 70s).  It's always been one of my favorites, and I recently purchased the Oct 2003 release of the HEAVY HORSES CD, which includes two bonus tracks.    I'll let everyone else's commentary on the original 9 songs stand, but let me add this...    EVEN the bonus tracks on this album are great.  Usually when you hear bonus tracks, you instantly KNOW why they were never released.  Not so with \\"Living in These Hard Times\\" and \\"Broadford Bazaar\\".  Both have that lovely minstrel and rural feeling of Tull's Songs From the Wood and Heavy Horses sessions.  Very nice.

B000P0J024|5.0|I'm not going to rehash how wonderful these performances are but I WILL  go on about how superb the remastered recording is. Back when these were originally released on CD it was in the dark days of digital music reproduction (the horrors of modern day Mp3 \\"music\\" notwithstanding) and the sound was a flat as a Lubbock County cotton field.  Now comes a proper presentation through digital remastering and these recordings have never sounded better. Your ears will delight in a beautifully thrown soundstage, in the sweet highs, proper lows and the no longer middling mid-range.   Order this release today. Your love affair with the Wilburys will be rekindled.

B000LC55F2|2.0|A really intriguing film up until the final payoff. At that point it requires a sci-fi leap of faith that many will be unable to make, myself and my wife included. Great cast (especially the treat of David Bowie) that ultimately almost redeems the end game plot conceit...but not quite.   Reminds me of landing jumbo jets at the old Austin airport. Drop out of the sky like a rock but get it down safely and no one complains because they're just glad to get home.
B000001F7R|4.0|Over the years I've had it on 8-track, LP and CD. It's straight-forward old school metal that bears no resemblance to the radio friendly stuff that would emerge starting with Pyromania. Be sure to check out their sophomore release, \\"High 'n' Dry\\". It rocks even harder and has much better production.     Oh... \\"Darth Kommissar\\" mentioned in his review that Pete Willis and Steve Clark got kicked out of the band... Get a clue! Pete Willis WAS kicked out, but Steve Clark DIED, he did not get forced out.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|WARNING:  FULL OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I watched The Gilmore Girls since day 1 and loved it, even though it had some big flaws:<br /><br />1. The show was too elitist. There was not a single important African-American character (Michel is French).  I feel the writers in season 7 were keenly aware of this and tried to somehow make up for it by having a black nurse with a couple of good lines confronting Emily, and having Emily admit to finding Will Smith charming.  Too little, too late; but more than the Palladinos did in 6 years.<br /><br />Another example of this elitism is how they treat the Lane story line.  A Korean-American who is as smart and well-read as Rory, ends up as a waitress in Luke's diner married to a total dimwit.  In real life, she whould have gotten 1 or 2 scholarships to Ivy League schools;  And Zach would have just been a summer crush instead of the father of her twin boys!<br /><br />2.  Most characters were obnoxious at one point or another.  The most obnoxious one being Michel.  I would not have been sad to see him leave the show.  Taylor, Kirk, Emily, Richard, Sookie,TJ, even Lorelei and Rory got on my nerves at time.  I think this was truly the fault of the writers who pushed the character flaws or rapid-fire lines to the max for comic impact.<br /><br />3.  Season 6 was horrible, starting with Luke finding out he had a daughter and the whole Lane/Zach relationship: PLEASE!!!!.<br /><br />NOW FOR SEASON 7:<br />Unlike most reviewers, I think the departure of the Palladinos was a good thing.  The dialogue slowed down a bit, allowing more emotion to shine through, more in-depth look at the characters, and yet keeping the same level of humor.  In other words, the show remains witty but much less superficial.  I am left wondering if these new writers had had a couple of more seasons, what they could have come up with.  They did a pretty good job considering the mess the Palladinos left behind.<br /><br />Again, unlike most reviewers, I never went for the Luke/Lorelei romance.  Luke summed up my feelings on this subject well when he said \\"Lorelei will remain Lorelei, and I will remain the guy who pours coffee for her\\". I think they were great friends, but they did nothing for me as a  couple.  I had felt cheated when Christopher and Lorelei were getting together and had to stop due to Sherry's pregnancy in an earlier season.  So it was great for me to see them together in Season 7; I was really rooting for them to stay together and was sad for both when it ended.  That said, the way the writers developed the story and it's end was really well done.  And I can see that the pressure from the audience was too big for the Luke/Lorelei pairing; so I can understand.<br /><br />Now for Rory, again most reviewers will not agree with me.  I thought the Jess/Rory story line was great.  Whenever Jess was onscreen it was amazing, and there was just pure chemistry between Rory and him.  I would have loved seeing them end up together, especially since he cleaned up his act and became a writer.  But Logan came in, and after a while he grew on me.  So having them go through so much, and splitting them up at the end was very disappointing.  I felt so bad for Logan when he walks away from Rory after she returns the ring.  I could not believe that they end with Lane and Zach; and Paris and Doyle together, and they break apart Rory and Logan?!! HORRIBLE.  I mean they didn't have to end up getting married, but they could have ended up still a couple.<br /><br />This ending really affected me not only because I have a romantic streak and wanted a truly happy ending for all, but because it seemed to me that they were not consistent with the story line. Throughout the seasons, the story line was developed on the premise that Rory really loved Logan. By splitting them up, I felt the message here was that a career was more important than true love.  They could have done better.<br /><br />Perhaps in the near future we can have a \\"Gilmore Women\\" and get to reunite Rory and Logan.<br /><br />In any case, I write all this with a smile on my face for having been witness to a wonderful show, with wonderful actors.  It's a credit to the actor playing Logan that he becomes lovable after being such a jerk; that I could like Emily and Richard, even though they are such snobs, that I loved Christopher with all his shortcomings, Luke with his gruffness, Miss Patty, Babette, Jackson.  Now Sookie, what a wonderful and consistent performance throughout; and last but not least Lorelei, who was truly deserving of at least one Emmy and who truly carried not only the show but who was the perfect match for Rory's performance as well.<br /><br />It's also a credit to the original creators, producers, old writers, and new writers, that even though I disagreed with much of their story lines and character developments, I could still see the quality of the show shining through in 6 of the 7 years (Season 6 is hopeless for me).<br /><br />PLEASE DO \\"THE GILMORE WOMEN:  The Gilmore Girls 5 years later\\" as a movie or mini series.  Your fans will be eternally grateful.<br /><br />Thank you Gilmore Girls, and goodbye, I will miss you.with a smile on my face for having been witness to a wonderful show, with wonderful actors.

B0002SVW3O|5.0|If you read other reviews, you will get a taste that this album is clearly different from Sigur Ros' others.  However, for people like me, that is very enjoyable (even though I do like their others).  I believe they were looking for their sound, and didn't know what worked or didn't.  I can hear influences from many people, including My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, 7% Solution, and even Pink Floyd.  As another reviewer stated, you can think of this album as a sound collage.  It is very dreamy and atmospheric, and for me, that is what I look for in a lot of my music.  So if you want to relax to something hypnotic, I would suggest this.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is without a doubt a mind-blowing collection, from the first to the third CD, clear and refined recordings of Led Zeppelin's California concerts from 1972. You will not be able to sit still, I guarantee you that, and if you are not up on your feet stomping along with Robert's vocals and Jimmy's guitar and John Bonam's driving drums, with the groovy bass of John Paul Jones from the very start, then you are not a rocker!<br />The first CD is my favorite one, starting with the good old hard rock we love Zeppelin for, and no one could do like them, songs like \\"\\"Immigrant Song\\", and of course, \\"Heartbreaker\\", the wailing bluesy \\"Since I've been loving you\\", then the brilliant,\\"Stairway to Heaven\\", with Robert Plant's comments adding a touch of familiarity and charm (\\"You remember laughter?\\"), continuing with the finest acoustic version of \\"California\\", and \\"That's the Way\\", ending with \\"Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp\\", Robert Plant's song for Strider, his dog.<br />The third disc has a spectacular version of \\"The Ocean\\", so fine!<br />Do I recommend this album? Yes!!! Most definitely, and it will most likely become the most prized CD in your rock collection as soon as you hear it.
B0007M22TI|4.0|This example of the many \\"Celtic Woman\\" DVD's and CD's is fantastic in the purity of voice and visual presentation. Others have detailed the individual performances and the presence and beauty of the performers. I agree completely! However, I also found the total concert(?) a little flat and much too even in tempo and pitch. That is, I hoped for more variety and a more boisterous presentation. (Possibly, a tiny bit more like \\"Riverdance\\"?) Overall, it  was great. But, I found it faintly boring.
0743243153|5.0|I first read this book 20 years ago, and have read it more than once, and it had a huge effect on me. I just purchased a copy for my 21-year-old grandson, who can benefit from these messages about love, discipline, and responsibility. The book isn't religious, it's spiritual and psychological. I think the concepts in this book are important and the world would be a better place if more people understood them, concepts about taking responsibility for oneself and realizing that love is a decision and a commitment, not just a passing feeling. I still admire this book after all these years.

Because so many people will not know the difference, \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is a dark day in our make believe military history!
B000002P2V|3.0|I have really mixed feelings about this album.  Some of the songs are really good, especially musicially.  However, lyrically this album leaves a lot to be desired.  In later Who albums (especially here), Townshend starting writing songs on being a rock star and writer's block, two problems that most people don't have to deal with.  The lyrics are especially trite in New Song and Guitar and Pen.  Musically, New Song is fine, but the lyrics really detract from it.  Guitar and Pen is the same way, and the lyrics are even more trite.  Music Must Change, well, has a rather obvious title.  Sister Disco is a pretty good rocker, and I like the acoustic guitar solo at the end.  However, John Entwistle writes about much more interesting things, such as human population and \\"being tired of loving my brothers\\".  Entwistle's contributions here are rather good, especially the song 905, which is one of my favorite Entwistle songs.  Had Enough is funny, despite an annoying synthesizer line, and Trick of the Light is the most explosive song on the album.<br /><br />As we know, this was Moon's last album, and his skills were in deterioration due to the ridiculously excessive drug intake over the years.  It's really a shame, too.  Once in a while, the old Moon appears (especially on the title track, Guitar and Pen, and the intro to Trick of the Light), but overall, his playing is very subdued and at times sloppy.  Reportedly, Music Must Change had a 6/8 time signature drum part, but Moon couldn't play it, so Townshend dropped it, and the only percussion on it is some cymbal crashing.  Moon's slower drumming actually works well on Entwistle's song 905.  It allows the vocals and instrumentation to really come through.  This may have been unintentional because of Moon's deteriorating skills, and that he couldn't handle a more complicated drum part (like on Music Must Change), but no matter, it still works.<br /><br />Overall, Who Are You is worth a listen or two, but ultimately is disappointing.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Despite a lack of box office success at the time of its initial release, SERENITY has gone on to be a consistently strong seller on the DVD market.  Much like the DVD of FIREFLY, it never topped the Best Seller lists (except at Amazon.com and other on line sellers), but like the series box set it has continued to sell to both old and new fans, gradually building an audience.  I'm aware that some people feel that the film is not intelligible without having seen the series first.  I saw the series several times before seeing the film in the theater, so I am unable to address this.  I will say that my sister and one of her sons saw the film on DVD and loved it.  They then got the FIREFLY set and became big fans of the series as well.  My point is that not everyone finds the film hard to follow if they haven't seen the series, but I do believe that the film is best viewed as a wrap up of FIREFLY.<br /><br />In a way, Joss Whedon has broken a promise.  This is a good thing.  At the time of the initial DVD release he stated that there would not be a later DVD release.  This was in response to complaints that Universal (a studio I have warm feelings for because their logo comes up every time I pop my BATTLESTAR GALACTICA DVDs into my player) is fairly notorious for double-dipping, i.e., releasing a DVD and then a few months later releasing an expanded version of the DVD, perhaps to release an even more expanded or \\"director's cut\\" version a few months after that.  Many studios engage in this practice, but Universal seems to be the worst of the bunch.  But this release comes largely as the result of fan requests.  There actually was a two-disc version of SERENITY released in Australia (which I took the effort to track down on eBay, though I can only watch it on my computer using AnyDVD to get past the regional coding) with a different set of extra features available on this new release.  I'm delighted that SERENITY is finally getting the 2-disc treatment in the US as well.  Fans of the TV show never got all the FIREFLY that we wanted so each additional exposure to Mal and his crew is like water to someone dying of thirst.<br /><br />FIREFLY/SERENITY will, I believe, be viewed as critical, along with BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, in redefining film and TV Sci-fi.  The two shows (and I do think of SERENITY as the final act of FIREFLY) established a new aesthetic for Sci-fi by bringing a new sense of realism along with a rejection of what could be called Magic Science for plot resolution.  By Magic Science I am thinking of all those situations in a host of movies and TV episodes (STARGATE SG-1 specialized in this) where a very imaginative physics is utilized to get the heroes out of a dangerous situation.  Our heroes might be caught in a time warp that can only be overcome by reversing the polarity of the warp drive engines, or, uh, something.  Neither FIREFLY nor BSG engage in such shenanigans.  Their solutions to problems always seem very much like the kind of solutions that we would utilize.  In other words, both shows eschew scientific gimmicks.  The two also refuse to employ that old stock in trade, the alien.  There simply are no aliens on either FIREFLY or BSG.  The Reavers are very much a human creation, as are the Cylons.  Furthermore, both strive for more realistic visuals.  Although SERENITY employs more traditional film techniques (thanks to highly regarded cinematographer Jack Green), both these series largely used hand held cameras (especially BSG, which uses exclusively high def video).  FIREFLY pioneered the technique, later employed magnificently by BSG, of employing \\"zoom\\" in CGI shots.  In both shows one will see a spaceship and then the \\"camera\\" (which doesn't exist) zooms in, going briefly out of focus while the visual field is adjusted, for a closer look.  Not surprisingly, the special effects outfit that originated this for FIREFLY, Zoic, later provided special effects for BSG.  (In fact, they couldn't resist putting Serenity into the BSG Miniseries.  If you watch the first scene in Caprica City, where the camera first looks up through a skylight and then lowers down into what turns out to be the office of Laura Roslin's doctor, Serenity can be seen as the only ship going from right to left.)  And both shows introduced retro elements to provide a unique look.  FIREFLY is influenced by a 19th century Old West look in clothing and weaponry, along with a number of Oriental elements, while BSG often uses design from the forties and fifties (e.g., the phones on the show were taken from a WW II submarine).  In the past, new Sci-fi TV series set in space basically had to define themselves against the aesthetic of the Star Trek shows.  In the future, they are going to define themselves against the recreation of Sci-fi brought about by FIREFLY and BSG.<br /><br />FIREFLY and SERENITY, as well as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL, can in many ways be viewed as a product of Third Wave feminism.  (Anyone doubting the centrality of feminism in everything that Whedon does--and if you doubt it you simply haven't been paying attention--should go to Youtube.com and search \\"joss whedon equality now speech\\" and listen to the speech he gave following an award they gave him.)  While TV Sci-fi has long been a means for representing nontraditional roles for women, Whedon has been instrumental in taking this to the next level.  Buffy Summers was created specifically to be a feminist cultural icon and there is no question that Whedon succeeded.  She might not fit the ideal criteria set forward by Second Wave feminism (or, rather, the caricature of the Second Wave feminism--contrary to the stereotype, most of the major Second Wave feminists wore make up and bras, liked men while hating patriarchy, and were heterosexual), but by Third Wave practice (which is generally viewed as more pro-sex, less PC, more experimental, brasher, and less concerned with victimization than with self-assertion) she is perfect.  Whedon loves empowered women.  While comics have long had female super heroes, until the nineties there were shockingly few genuine female heroes on TV or in movies.  We never thought twice about Batman or Superman or Rambo, but we had to wait a long time to see a strong female hero like Ellen Ripley in film and even longer for Dana Scully, Xena, and Buffy on TV.  Why were only men allowed to be fantasy heroes?  Some seem to find Buffy objectionable without noting that there never has been a super soldier like Rambo.  Following Buffy (who seems to have been the influence on future heroic women, rather than Xena) came a host of empowered women.  So it is no surprise that in SERENITY we find that Mal Reynolds's second in command is the tough-as-nails and stoic Zoe, who is just as hardened and combat ready as any of the men.  Despite decades of films showing women collapsing at the death of men close to them, we aren't surprised when Zoe postpones mourning the death of her husband.  There will be time to cry later, right now there is fighting to be done.  And River Tam is one of Whedon's most compelling heroines.  River's fight is not just against external monsters, but also against the attempt that has been made to turn her into a monster.  A genius and child prodigy, River had been programmed and engineered to becoming an assassin, but was freed by her brother Simon.  At the heart of SERENITY is the question whether River will become the killing machine they intended her to be or will she become a person.  As Mal asks her, \\"Are you just a weapon?\\"<br /><br />One of the things I love about Joss Whedon is how he continually defies our expectations.  He does this marvelously with The Operator, played magnificently by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  Working for the powers that be, he sees himself as a good man doing difficult but good things.  SERENITY is about the monsters that society creates by the elevation of corporate interests above human interests (yeah, it is a Marxist theme,but any close watcher of BUFFY will recall the famous shot from the end of \\"Ann,\\" the Season Three premiere, where after Buffy liberates workers from a demon factory, where the workers are literally worked to death, she stands with a hammer and a sickle in her hands).  The Operator learns that he has unwittingly helps support powers that have created monsters, whether River or the Reavers.  His redemption at the end is classic Whedon.<br /><br />I don't know what the long-term future of SERENITY will be.  It does not completely stand on its own like BLADE RUNNER or THE MATRIX.  It will forever be tied to FIREFLY.  But I believe that this should be seen as a strength rather than a weakness.  Knowing the series lends this film a depth lacking in other series.  For instance, knowing that Jayne isn't the trustworthiest soul helps understand some of his actions in the film (not to mention knowing he has a remarkably large collection of T-shirts).  Or Kaylee's ongoing attraction to Simon and his odd reluctance to open up to her.  Or the long, complicated relationship between Mal and Inara (the greatest tragedy of the film is that their relationship, which was incredibly important for the series, received short shrift--Whedon has promised that if there is a sequel to the film, which at present looks unlikely, that this will be rectified).  Or what Shepherd Book's background is.  All of which is to say that FIREFLY/SERENITY is unique and wonderful.  Along with BSG, this series and film completely renewed my interest in TV Sci-fi.women.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Snakes and Arrows is a fresh new album from Rush. You hear a liitle of Rush's retro sound , but you are also treated to the bands progressive sounds. This new album will grow on you over time. It is a good album the first time through, but becomes a really great one after a few listens. The three instumentals on this disc are fantastic. Workin' Them Angels is also great with Alex treating us with a mandolin solo. If you happen to see them on their current tour (I was at the Tampa show...GREAT SHOW!!) they play 9 songs from this album-and you will really appreciate these new songs.
0393051587|5.0|This is a great edition of the novel, full of annotations that explain the meanings and usages of words from the time period.  Although this story can - and is - enjoyed without the annotations, this version is a rich companion to the various other popular versions.  It is also a fine looking volume.  As to the story, we would be hard pressed to find people not familiar with A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, due to several movies the novel has spawned. I finally sat down and read the novel and am glad I did. The novel by the prolific and popular Dickens is well-written with great characters. That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power. This book packs an emotional punch, and is a great tale for the holidays, or any time you need to remind yourself to be thankful for what you have and those around you. A classic story and a must read. 5 stars.

015626224X|4.0|Orwell presents this story as an autobiography. He starts the story in Paris where he prepares to go to work in a Hotel but then for a variety of reasons sort of just descends into poverty. Being an English teacher doesn't work and waiting to take a job in a hotel and the problems he has leaves him close to starvation. Even finding the Hotel job just leaves him with long hours of work and he finds himself at the bottom of a hotel's social structure. This is reflective of the society he lives in where there are little opportunities for one to rise above where one starts in life and of course work. He describes drinking on a Saturday night as the \\"one thing that made life worth living\\". At one point a murder happens right outside where he is sleeping and he just comments that within three minutes he had gone back to sleep not wanting to waste time over it. In London he lives as a beggar and a tramp and the experience just adds to his understanding of being down and out. Life there is no better for him. One can not help but think of \\"1984\\", and much of Orwell's other writings, and see in the story told here some of what later was the core of his message. His work in the Hotel was considered slavery and it seemed to him that the cause was that the lower class was trapped. In part the reason for being trapped was that the rich were just unconcerned and unaware of the poor. He could also see that the rich may really fear what may be the inevitable rising up by the lower classes up to fight back. These events were ones that Orwell would have related to socialism and the issue of whether it was itself good or bad. One side of the society was looking for liberty and the other side fearing they could lose it.   The books conclusions are well worth reading and understanding. He acknowledges that what he has shown to be poverty is really just a small insight into what it really is. He uses the books characters to graphically show the human side of the poor. The conclusion is clear that the \\"down and out\\" are real people, individuals, and are important.

1594489505|5.0|This novel weaves together a detailed tapestry of the tragedies Afghan women are suffering.  I was both moved to tears & stomach sick at the daily misery women must endure, artfully outlined in every page.  How fortunate are we to live in a democracy and have the privilege to vote, to be heard?  There are so many countries that consider women nothing more than chattel.  Thank you, Mr. Hosseini, for so skillfully bringing their plight into focus with the brilliant characters in this novel.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I did not expect much of this bio-pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist. In this regard, \\"Walk the Line\\" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent (\\"Election\\") but with her role in \\"Walk the Line\\" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration. Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.
1400079179|5.0|Easily one of the best books I have ever read. It had a very good, very twisty plot that was outstanding. I loved the short chapters than made for easy reading. Treat yourself to this masterpiece. Angels and Demons which also features the same character is also a great read.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on the Disneyland TV show in the early 1950's.  It absolutely enthralled me.     The masterful animation, the fascinating story and the uplifting music go a long way in making the delicious fantasy almost seem true.    As in all good, juicy stories, characters give each other a rough time. Captain Hook stalks Peter Pan and even gives him a deadly bomb! Peter Pan also taunts the good captain. The crocodile also does his best to make Captain Hook's life a misery.  Funny how the PC police never bring up these male-on-male confrontations.     But once Tinkerbell gets jealous of Wendy, or the mermaids act uppity,  then we are dealing with female-on-female bullying, and that doesn't go over with the ladies nowadays. Never mind that it's a fact of life.     As for the caricatured native American stereotypes, that's all they are.  Unhappily, a lot of caricatures are exaggerated images which have grown up around a kernel of truth. And they apply to all races. As a white male, my biggest nightmare is that I may someday actually look like Homer Simpson, Elmer Fudd or Popeye.  But I'll just have to take my chances.    Kids are very sensitive to the energy around them, and if you sit there watching Disney's Peter Pan with them in a guarded, PC resistance-stance, they'll tune right into it and then get turned off.    Why not lighten up, and take this film on its own wonderful fantasy terms? That positive energy will enhance the experience for your little ones.  If ever a film was made for children, this is one of the best.
1582701709|1.0|What a heaping pile of crap. The ideas presented in this book are only appropriate for children to believe. Anyone with an IQ over that of a gerbil will find this book (and its author) just plain silly and actually a hinderance to any kind of positive transformation in their lives. I mean, how can you treat a book seriously that believes you won't get fat if you don't look at fat people?
B000P2A24W|2.0|While I am a BIG Bon Jovi fan, this albumn has really disappointed me. I realize that John Bon Jovi has taken a new road as far as his music. However, this albumn has too much of a country sound and feel. There is not enough rock and what helped Bon Jovi (unlike the many hair bands of the 80's) survive throughout the years. If you like the new country sound, this albumn may be just what you are looking for.  If not, I suggest maybe just buying the singles that you like. (If you can find one.) For the country lovers, \\" I love this town\\" ,is a song you will really like . For the rockers at heart, you maybe extremely disappointed by this albumn.
0743454529|5.0|I've read several of Ms. Picoult's books, and this is my favorite so far.  Anna, in many ways, is more mature than most 13-year-olds, yet is still a child who needs her family.  Sara seems to have tunnel vision in looking out for her children's best interests, but I think it would be hard not to feel the way she does.  I found the \\"lost and found\\" relationship between Cameron and Julia a bit hard to believe, and probably not really necessary for the advancement of the story.  The ending completely caught me off-guard, but I wasn't disappointed by it at all.  I'd definitely recommend this book.
1904233023|5.0|I read very little science fiction as typically I am more drawn to fantasy or horror titles.  I picked this book up on a recommendation from a friend and boy am I glad I did.  Card not only managed to draw me into his world, but was able to genuinely catch me off-guard with the ending of the book which, unfortunately, doesn't happen very often.  His portrayal of Ender is deep and meaningful and indeed, drives the story itself.  The premise of the story is exciting and reveals the authors deep understanding and identification with the human condition.  Additionally, there is a message here, rather profoundly delivered, that manages to provide allegory without venturing into the pretentious or preachy trap that many other \\"books with messages\\" tend to fall into.    All in all, Ender's Game will provide you with a story that is deep, engaging, entertaining and touching with none of the irritating stuff that clutters otherwise decent story lines in this genre.  In short, it's everything you love about science fiction (and indeed, books in general) with none of the stuff you hate.  Highly recommended.
B000002UC5|5.0|I always feel sentimental when I listen to this album.  My LP is long gone and I'm thrilled to have finally found this CD (it wasn't available the last time I looked).  I'm not the Beatles fan in my family (although I grew up listening to the music).  My dad was and still is.  Aside from all the Beatles records he had, he also had this album which was originally released the year  I was born.  These songs were the songs of my very early childhood.  Although I am sure that earlier reviewers were correct when stating that this album does not meet the standards we have come to expect from McCartney after the Beatles era.  Still, lets not forget that at this point in his life, the Beatles were over.  Why would any artist continue using the same style in a new phase of his life/career.  I think of Sting's solo album after The Police.  Many die hard Police fans did not like Sting's first solo album.  I don't think it was that bad albeit different from The Police.  Likewise for McCartney.  Well, regardless of how good or bad people view his post-Beeatles work, I will always love this album.  Junk singalong was a melody I remember fondly as a child.  Maybe I'm Amazed is a song my dad often strummed on his guitar.  I will always equate this album to the early 70's.  I don't long for the past but remembering it is bittersweet.  Isn't this the purpose of good music --to touch us emotionally.
0385522401|4.0|I decided to read this after I read a review in S.F. Chronicle.  This book is definitely a short novel, a very tight read, at just a bit over 200 pages.  But the story is very well written and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's the wedding night of Edward and Florence.  As they are trying to enjoy their first wedded dinner, the apprehension of their first night together and tension surrounding this important intimate encounter is the basis for this novel.  A story that makes you laugh and cringe as you peek into the emotional turbulence these characters are experiencing during their desperate situation.  A tiny treasure of a novel.
0143038419|5.0|This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down at all. Gilbert writes with such honesty and passion that you feel as though you are her best friend along for the journey. It also makes you want to pick up and go to each of these countries, which Gilbert describes with such grace. Beautifully written, a splendid story.
1401302378|4.0|It may seem like we live in a cultural world dominated by big chains and blockbusters - wrong. Or, at least, we do, explains Chris Anderson in this thought provoking and compelling business book, but beyond the big hits - the bestsellers, the chart toppers - there is a very long tail, with demand snaking right down many thousands of products along. The vast majority of these albums, movies, juicing machines, rice pudding varieties or whatever you won't see in the shops - there just isn't space, but just because they aren't on the high street doesn't mean there isn't a demand for them.<br /><br />Anderson traces the rise and fall of the hit across many cultural media, but focusing mainly on television and music where the long tail is hitting hardest. It used to be that we sat down and watched or listened to what was brought to us - by the filters of the record labels and tv studios. Now, fuelled massively by the internet, a much wider range of cultural participation can emerge as the tools of production have become democratised. Smaller bands can get a song or album out there - and guess what, it gets listened to! No matter how small you are, there is a demand for what you have to offer - for the endless choice of the digital age is also leading to unlimited demand. Welcome to the age of the niche.<br /><br />Anderson explains how this can lead to a wide cross pollinisation of cultural phenomena - he writes brilliantly about the DJs across countries who have taken songs, mashed them up, and created a plethora of versions of a song with a creative remix often being preferred to the original song. Tiny home movies can generate massive audiences through word of mouth if they feature on the web (this is where Long Tail theory meets up with 'Tipping Point' theory, as expostulated by Malcolm Gladwell), dominant websites are not always amazon or bbc news - blogs run by individuals with something interesting to say can generate thousands of hits per day as well. And tying it all up, of course, is the mighty google which can filter through all of this information bringing forth cultural flotsam and ads from right down the tail.<br /><br />On balance, I think this is an invigorating and ennobling theory, the best thing I have read that makes a positive cultural case for internet. One thing bothers me though. Anderson explains that with everything now able to come to market, the existing 'cultural filters' such as film studios and record labels will have less power - I am a book editor, so maybe I will have to seek other employment before long.urse, is the mighty google which can filter through all of this information bringing forth cultural flotsam and ads from right down the tail.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|I just finished listening to this CD. It is an impressive work. She has a powerful seductive ethereal lyrical voice that is so very expressive. She can really punch it out. It is so rare to hear someone with such power to also be able to modulate her voice seemingly with no effort. She has great style. She's like a Porsche running through the gears - real restrained power - she sounds like she is on the edge. The production on this album is excellent and the material is very good. I tip my hat to T-Bone. She doesn't make the mistake of double tracking her voice so the album never sounds banal. The people she plays with are also very good. Very effective back up vocals. The band has a real honest sound that is lacking in so much work these days. It feels like a live recording. I would highly recommend this CD for a spin. I get the strong sense that she is  going to be an enduring talent. The only reason that I don't give this 5 stars is because I feel that very few albums deserve five stars. In my mind it has to be a groundbreaking work to get five stars. Eat a Peach, Revolver, Kind of Blue - these albums deserve five stars. That being said, I would give this CD a 4.5. She is the real deal and I am going to find tickets to see this act live.
078322611X|5.0|Field of Dreams, is more than a great Baseball movie, its about following a calling or dream despite what others think. This is a bright movie with great cinamatography. When Joe Jackson appears for the first time is magic. At first i didnt understand why the Black Sox, but soon realized why. You really need to see this and Eight men out to understand. Field of Dreams is a joy for Baseball fans or movie buffs.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|Back in the 70's and 80's I used to purchase all Bruce's records, collect all his bootleg albums, stand in line sometimes overnight to get tickets to his shows ... Ah! you get the picture.    But once the Born in the USA tour was over, Bruce went down the tubes (in my book). Yeah, he still did some great shows, but those memories faded fast. He seemed to be getting an attitude.     Here, however, he seems to have once again captured some of his earlier energy and commitment to the fans. This double-cd is great! He definitely has regained his knack (here) for musical arrangements that'll stand the test of time.     If you are a floundering Bruce fan, get this one; it'll be one cd you'll wear out. Well worth the money.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|The movie is basically just a backdrop to the album 'Discovery' from Daft Punk.  More specifically it would be imagining the reversal of creating a soundtrack around a movie, and instead creating a movie around an album.  It is an interesting concept, and it works very well in this instance.  If you are a fan of Daft Punk it is a bit of a no-brainer...if however you are looking for a deep tranquil film concerning the problems of today's society mired in soul searching agony...well keep looking.  This is entertainment!

Maybe it needs to grow on me but beside the ballads, I'd rather listen to their old albums, like \\"Have a Nice Day\\" and \\"Bounce\\".  I hope this was an experiment and they are going to write more rock songs for the next album.

B000PGTPE6|5.0|\\"The fact is when Bruce kicked off at 20.30 pm on that Friday night in The Point Theatre, he played non-stop right to the very end very few performers can sustain such intensity and carry a gig off that would be to us punters unforgettable those night were UNFORGETTABLE!!!!!!!I thought Bruce was never gonna stop and the highlight of the night Bruce lying exhausted over the top of the piano as if he had not a breath left in the world. Dublin was a case of the time the music and the performer - A MOMEMT IN TRUE HISTORY FOR DUBLIN TOWN.\\" IrishJohnny<br /><br />\\"Live In Dublin' was one of those once in a lifetime events that we all wish we had attended. Every reviewer sings praise for this CD and DVD. Veteran concert goers and reviewers say this was the best concert they had ever attended. That is all well and good, but in the end Bruce Springsteen and the Sessions Band care about their fans. You can hear the fans singing along, 'Pay Me My Money Down ', 'Further On Up The Road', 'Erie Canal' and then there is 'Mrs McGrath' an obvious Irish favorite. Just when you think this CD could not get any better, the Boss kicks it up a notch. In fact I was singing along with the rest of'em. The ambience that the live audience gives to this CD is palpable. Springsteen and the audience must have shared the energy and the vibes from the Irish. You can feel the excitement in the air. I thought the Seeger CD was one of the Boss's best CD's, but the 'Live In Dublin' is undoubtabley the best. As my best friend has said, \\"This is one of the top five CD's ever\\".<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau said, \\"'Live in Dublin' charts the development of a band from an informal gathering in Bruce's living room to an onstage powerhouse. It also documents the growth in Bruce's vision of American music; it includes folk music, blues, Dixieland, country, swing, gospel, rock, down to and including his own writing. It's all performed with Bruce's classic energy and focus. I think it's some of the finest music he's ever made.\\" The 23 songs on this CD are the best of the best. Included are many from his Seegers CD. They all belong in Springsteen's chest of dreams.<br /><br />This CD and DVD are memorial for the emotions that are so evident in every song. Songs like the antiwar \\"Mrs. McGrath\\" and \\"O Mary Don't You Weep\\" benefit from these in-concert performances, \\"and a 17-piece band allows Springsteen to freewheel onto back roads\\" said Marty Lance. \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" becomes a lovely waltz, \\"Open All Night\\" swings like Bob Wills, and \\"Growin' Up\\" and \\"Blinded by the Light\\" are new arrangements. \\"The high point, however, just might be \\"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live,\\" the 1929 Blind Alfred Reed song that Springsteen has retrofitted with new lyrics about the government's bungling of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath. Bruce's connection to folk protest deepens, on the rewrite of \\"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live\\". A Depression era classic that Springsteen found on a Ry Cooder album and then amended with his own brilliantly Bush-baiting verse is perhaps the most politically extreme and, as hammered home here, exultant performance of his career.\\" Even more wonderful is \\"Eyes On The Prize\\", sung with Mark Anthony Thompson. \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\", a duet with Patty Sciafla, is one of my favorites, and \\"When The Saints Go Marching In\\" and \\"This Little Light Of Mine\\" rock free and easy. \\"In short, it's everything Springsteen's big-hearted thoughtfully impassioned take on Americana ever set out to be.

0312954468|3.0|The narrator of this book is an amazing all-in-one product, a mastery of the human race. He's the Leonardo da Vinci of his day, a self-proclaimed doctor, architect, priest, tutor, charioteer, playwright, painter, cook, tracker, astrologist, marathon runner, and all-around scholar. The only things he isn't, really, are two: a soldier (even he admits he's a coward), and a man (he's a eunuch).      Taita, the slave, singlehandedly changes the course of ancient Egyptian history - more than once. He is the reason for failed revolts, the downfall of gangs of thieves, various brilliant surgical techniques, the mastery of the wheel, improved naval tactics, and oh yeah, you know those flower pillars in Egyptian temples? He came up with those.    By the time I'd reached the middle of RIVER GOD, Taita had already come to be like an old friend - I could always trust him to bust out some adventure and suitable knowledge or craftiness to save the day. In fact, everything in this book is extremely Taita-centered. He never fails. Not once. What Taita the slave sets out to do, Taita the slave succeeds in doing.    Whether that's good or bad is up to you. But if anything, this character serves as a vital tool in being able to fully experience every facet of ancient Egyptian life. The amount of detail packed in illuminates Egypt remarkably, and I'd recommend this to anyone looking to get a feel for every day life back then.    Despite Smith's vivid detail, however, the endless episodes of war and hunting began to weary me. It seemed that every dozen pages someone would die, but the main problem? I didn't care for any of them. The characters are flat as the Earth was in the year 1407. There's the dazzling prince, the beautiful maiden (or two), the coldly nefarious villain, etc. etc. They each do exactly what's expected of them. And the only refuge from this is, well, the action.    RIVER GOD is a daring book that sets out to breathe life and adventure into times of political uprising,intrigue, and brutality. It's  a well-researched, relatively exciting jaunt through ancient Egypt, but at the core of everything, it takes on the tone of the obligingly violent action flick. For ancient Egyptian literature with mind-boggling political intrigue and great characters, check out works by Pauline Gedge such as [[ASIN:0848813359 Child of the Morning]]. For just another enjoyable day reading, RIVER GOD will do the job.

0441009425|2.0|The publishers of this book, Orion Publishing Group, should be ashamed of themselves. This is my first book by alastair reynolds. Though I think he could one day be a very competent writer, I feel like he isn't really \\"there\\" yet. However, if Orion wanted to publish a book by him, they could have at least put an interested Editor on board in order to clean up the numerous spelling mistakes, typographical errors, character flaws, plot holes, and narrative definicies rampant throughout the novel.<br /><br />I skimmed the last hundred or so pages because the writing just got increasingly worse. The dialogue was terrible. There was constant repetition of previous passages. I feel like this book was written in pieces, and instead of tying it all together in a seamless fashion, the author clumped it together, and badly at that.<br /><br />However, I did finish the book, so there must have been some redeeming qualities.
B000P2A24W|4.0|On their new record, Bon Jovi find themselves on a Lost,   if somewhat familiar highway. The Nashville influence,   by way of the Jersey shore,  serves them well and the result  is a solid, accessible album that showcases Jon's voice,   tight musician ship, and solid songwriting.    My personal favorite is Everybody's Broken, which Jon and Richie penned   with Billy Falcon, perhaps Nashville's finest writer.    There are numerous standout tracks including the lead single,   Make A Memory, Whole Lot Of Leavin', Seat Next To You and a fine   duet with Leann Rimes, Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore that   complements the album and is not at all pandering to the  Country audience.    I Love This Town is a nice homage to the wonderful scene that   is music in Nashville.    All in all the record demontrates that this is a fine rock band that   has absorbed influences from varied sources, which should result in a  more diverse fanbase as they explore their muse. A keeper!    ps  and don't miss the Unplugged that airs tonight on CMT @ 9pm (eastern)   the band shines and Jon sounds terrific.
034547581X|2.0|This is an account of the first large scale encounter between the North Vietnamese Army and the Americans. Prior to this battle the Viet Cong had fought against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.(ARVN) The success of the Viet Cong had led the North Vietnamese to think that they could win the war by conventional means in 1965. They started to send large detachment of troops down the Ho Chi Min trail. The command problems the North Vietnamese faced was that it took literaly months for their troops to travel the length of the trail. The original plan which led to this battle was for the North Vietnamese to blockade a large town and then to ambush the ARVN relief column.<br /><br />The problem was that whilst the units were moving down the trail America committed large numbers of units to the war. This battle was not only an experiment for the North Vietnamese it also was for the Americans. Previously the French had problems in fighting the Vietnamese. Although they had modern forces their units were slow and the Vietnamese could make decisions about when to give battle. The Americans developed the notion of \\"Air Cavalary\\". Helicopter born infantry which could be quickly dropped in areas in which enemy troops were concentrated. This battle was the first combat experiance of Air Cavalary.<br /><br />Broadly what happened was that the North Vietnamese units failed in their attempt to trap an ARVN column. The Americans dropped an air cavalary unit in an area which had concentrations of the units which had been involved in this attack. The North Vietnamese had a superiority in numbers of troops but no artillery or air support. They decided to attack anyway. There were two distinct battles. One was an attempt to destroy a unit of 400 Air Cavalary troops which initially landed. This was not succesfull as the Americans were able to use artillery and air support to destroy the attacking North Vietnamese. The second was a ambush of American relief forces had been landed and decided to retreat after the completion of the first battle.<br /><br />The result overall of the engagement was inconclusive although it led to both sides thinking that they could win. The Americans inflicted a kill ration of something like 12 to 1. As a result the American commander thought that he could win a battle of attrition. It was from this battle that the search and destroy missions and body counts came from. The North Vietnamese although came out of the battle thinking that they could win. Despite the lack of artillery support and air support they had badly cut up one American column and they had inflicted casualties on the other.<br /><br />The book is pretty much an oral history of both battles. Like any oral history it gives a fragmented picture of what went on as it moves from one eye witness account to another. Not surprisingly as the book is written by an American the account has the veneer of heroism over it. Although in any battle there are different types of heroism. Whilst the American troops were clearly brave and the dependence on supply by helicopter meant that the troops on the ground were not supplied with water(preferance was given to ammunition)the North Vietnamese had to fight with light weapons against a vastly better armed enemy.t after the completion of the first battle.

Despite the lack of artillery support and air support they had badly cut up one American column and they had inflicted casualties on the other.     The book is pretty much an oral history of both battles. Like any oral history it gives a fragmented picture of what went on as it moves from one eye witness account to another. Not surprisingly as the book is written by an American the account has the veneer of heroism over it. Although in any battle there are different types of heroism. Whilst the American troops were clearly brave and the dependence on supply by helicopter meant that the troops on the ground were not supplied with water(preferance was given to ammunition)the North Vietnamese had to fight with light weapons against a vastly better armed enemy.
1594489505|5.0|As someone who has been traveling the world for 30 years now, writing about and observing the plight of women, I urge every thinking and caring person to step forward and say:  \\"The world must be made safe for women.  ENOUGH of the unfairness and the killing of innocent women!\\"  Although this is a fictional account, the stories of these very brave,honorable and lovable women could very well be the story of thousands of women. The only way for genuine change to come is for the men of the world to stand beside us, to step forward and say, \\"We are all women!\\"  Our governments spend billions, if not trillions, to fight their battles for power, while the urgent needs of women are pushed aside, forgotten.  Whatever happened to Laura Bush's plea for the poor women abused and even murdered at the hands of the Taliban, at the very beginning of the war against Afghanistan and Iraq, after 9/11?  I, for one, believe Laura Bush to be a very lovely human being, and don't have a gripe with her, but I do feel saddened because she spoke out for a political purpose but didn't follow up. She is in a position to do so much more.  She spoke intelligently and movingly about the plight of women in Afghanistan, then NOTHING.  The moment Afghanistan was invaded, the Taliban partially routed, the women were basically forgotten.  WHY?  This moving story brings all the heartaches back to mind.  I say, WE ARE ALL WOMEN, and when one women is abused or murdered, we are all abused and murdered -- our societies are diminished by the world attitude towards the female sex, pure and simple.  Let's all vow to do more to bring change to the world of women.  Thank you to this author for helping to give new life to this issue.  Jean Sasson, author of books revealing true stories of women.

B00005JLCI|4.0|OK...let me get my complaints outta the way, the things that make this film loose a star, first and foremost. After all, it's only my opinion.    I hate the way the Ghost is handled. Too literal...too much is shown. I prefer Zeff's take on the ghost to anyone's. Now that was creepy. This isn't. Also, Branagh has the WORST taste in music in all of Europe. It's embarrassing.    But this is a Hamlet to be seen. It's like no other. Yes, yes...the actors are fantastic, and it is beautiful to behold, like other Hamlets. Branagh's special device... and self challenge for which I applaud him, is to do the entire play. Every word. The whole shebang. In a world where even ABT is editing down their great works of 19th century entertainment, so it won't last longer than your average film I guess, this film is refreshing.     One must prepare for it. It's like going to see Wagner's \\"Ring\\" or a Eugene O'Neill play.... you know it's going to be long and intricate. You may become bored at times, but you must know you won't be for long before things pick up again, and paying attention has great rewards. Resolve yourself to meet it halfway. Also, like a Wagner opera, you must accept it for what it is, warts and all. Like a Bach Passion, or a Beethoven string quartet, it is a universe of its own. It is full of nooks and crannies. It is a complete world.    This is the great thing about this version of Hamlet. It's not tidied up for modern sensibilities of theatre. It's sprawling and expansive. The threat from Fortinbras and the entire \\"players\\" scene and the scenes on the ship to England....these tentacles from the main plot only add to the complete world of \\"Hamlet\\". It's wonderful! It puts it on par with \\"Lear\\" [which I've always though better]. It is epic. Art! With a capital \\"A\\".
038533348X|4.0|\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is Kurt Vonnegut's fourth novel and was perhaps his most autobiographical one when it was released.  Published in 1963 it features the Hoenikker family, and specifically the three kids, an elder son, a tall middle daughter, and a younger son are similar to Vonnegut's family.  This novel also helped turn Vonnegut into a popular author, when Graham Green said it was \\"one of the three best novels of the year.\\"  As with his other novels, Cat's Cradle is a satire, and while there is a science fiction element to it, that is not the strength of the work.    The narrator is a writer who is working on a book called \\"The Day the World Ended\\", which initially is about the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, and in particular the father of the atomic bomb, the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and in particular his three unusual kids and what they remember about the day the bomb was dropped.  However, like the title suggests, things are not always what they appear to be (\\"See the Cat?  See the Cradle?\\").      Vonnegut changes the focus of perception throughout the book.  The end of the world originally focused on the atomic bomb, changes to a new and different threat also created by Dr. Felix Hoenikker.  Bokonoism goes from a spoof of a religion to a religion of its own.  Perceptions also change with regards to San Lorenzo, the relationship between the government and religion, and the attitude of the narrator to writing.  Even the perception of the titles of the chapters changes as the reader progresses through the story.    The science element of this story is actually rather weak, although there is an intriguing concept; there is also a key point which Vonnegut doesn't address at all.  Nevertheless, the strength of the novel is in the insights, as well as the counter-culture elements, and the unusual style makes this an interesting read, to say the least.  When Vonnegut is discussed, often this novel is left out when it comes to what was his best.  However, his dark humor and social satire are well in evidence here, and this is not one to be missed.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Simple..... This is the most beautifully filmed, stunning movie I have ever seen....True to the comic, I was in awe of this when I finally saw it.
0441172717|5.0|I did not want to read this book- a friend lent it to me, saying it was about ecology, a subject I have never been interested in. One day, I was bored and saw it lying on the counter, so I picked it up and began to read. I finished it the next day and immediately began to read it again.<br />  There is so much to this book! Frank Herbert created an entire universe for his readers to explore, placing it's roots firmly in our own and then spinning it twenty-thousand years and thousands of light years away from us. The reader may notice Herbert's use of (fictional) Arabic-derived languages and the references to Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc.<br />  What I loved most about this novel, though, aside from the amazing complexity of the various storylines, was it's quality as a story. Our culture is steeped in \\"sci-fi\\" stories. They're everywhere. This was the first one I had ever read that didn't cause me to cringe. At all.<br />  Particularly good was Herbert's ironic use of the messiah myth, turning it on it's head by making his messiah an unwilling one, unable to alter his fate.<br />  I don't want to give away the story, so I'll just say that this is a book to be read, for it's philosophical musings, religious observations and political theory, as well as for the ride.
1600240003|5.0|Having begun life as a 16 part serial for the New York Times, \\"The Overlook\\" has a dramatically different flavour than the preceding 12 novels in the continuing, exciting Harry Bosch canon with which Connelly has thrilled his legion of fans. Less grim and foreboding, less atmospheric, less prone to the philosophical meandering that we've come to expect from the angst-ridden backcountry of Bosch's psyche, \\"The Overlook\\" is much more of a plot driven novel - a shorter, snappier, purely action oriented police procedural but no less successful and enjoyable for the differences!<br /><br />Dr Stanley Kent, a medical bio-physicist who had access to radioactive materials used in the treatment of cancers at hospitals throughout LA, has been found murdered - executed, in fact, with two bullets in the back of the head - on a Mulholland Drive overlook. Bosch, assigned to the murder with his new partner, Iggy Ferras, immediately begins to bump heads with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, called in on the case as a result of the potential terrorist involvement with the assassination. The case is mere minutes old and Kent's body has barely begun to cool when Bosch discovers that the crime also involves the theft of a case of potentially deadly radioactive Cesium-137. That the FBI agent assigned to the case is Rachel Walling, Bosch's love interest who we met in Connelly's last novel \\"Echo Park\\" complicates matters immensely but certainly doesn't prevent the inevitable inter-organizational war over case jurisdiction.<br /><br />Bosch, true to the mantra \\"Everybody counts or nobody counts\\" which we first heard in \\"The Last Coyote\\", focuses on people and is intent on finding Kent's murderers. The FBI, not too surprisingly, treats the murder as incidental and is intent on treating the theft of the Cesium as a threat to national security.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind ... Connelly is brilliant! Even with a purely plot-oriented novel, he has made sure that Bosch loses none of the flavour or depth of character so carefully built up in twelve previous novels. His interaction with Walling is both hot and heated (if you understand the subtle distinction). The jurisdictional squabbling and in-fighting has a definite tinge of realism and, frankly, it is difficult as a reader to sit in judgment in this particular case and take sides. Bosch and Walling, the FBI and the LAPD were all right and wrong at various moments in the novel!<br /><br />And what can one say about the ending? There is no way that any reader is going to see this fancy twist coming! If you're a Bosch fan, you're gonna love this one! If you haven't read any of Bosch's previous novels, don't start here ... go back and read four or five of the earlier novels (try to pick them up in chronological order - start with \\"The Black Echo\\") so you can get that underlying feel for the character first. Then come back and enjoy this one with the rest of us.<br /><br />Highly recommended!re that Bosch loses none of the flavour or depth of character so carefully built up in twelve previous novels.

1594489505|3.0|\\"Second novels, when they follow such a promising start, tend to disappoint,\\" wrote a NYT's reviewer about another author's work. Unlike in that particular review, I was disappointed in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" Not because it's not beautifully written. It is. And, not because the pathos of a complex society isn't clearly drawn. It is. Hosseini is eloquent in his descriptions of people, places,events. He's a wonderful storyteller. But, this is a story he has told before in \\"Kite Runner,\\" just not as well. I can't refrain from comparing the two books. \\"Kite Runner\\" is awesome in the depiction of clashes of politics and clan-bound cultures, and in it's study of human behavior shaped by them. The characters in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" do not appear as complex, as human, as easy to relate to; they pale in comparison to the people in \\"Kite Runner.\\" In spite of the characters' being mostly one-dimensional, vis-a-vis in \\"Kite Runner,\\" this book excels in linking the historical background to the political timeline. The bonus is the a wipe-a-tear love story with a happy ending.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have not read the book - so I am reviewing based solely on my enjoyment of the film for its own sake.  It is a lovely, whimsical, romantic tale that can be enjoyed many times over.  I appreciated the refreshing lack of profanity, crudity, and senseless violence that floods today's movies.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery, well acted - thoroughly enjoyable.  I highly recommend this!<br /><br />Update 6/18/12 - I have to be honest and say that I have seriously considered lowering this to a 4 star rating having since both read the book ([[ASIN:B000JMLFLW Pride and Prejudice]] - a free kindle download) and having watched [[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]] MANY times.  The Colin Firth version truly does justice to the story, which I now realize this version did not.<br /><br />Additionally in this version they have really taken some liberties in modernizing both the interactions (e.g. Elizabeth's wit takes on such a sarcastic, biting tone that it REALLY stretches my suspension of disbelief that a lady could have behaved in such a manner) as well as in the actions (e.g. Darcy walking into Elizabeth's private quarters at night, unannounced and with Elizabeth unattended).<br /><br />All that said, I've left it at 5 stars simply because as a standalone film, it's a wonderful story and a visual feast.  One can love it in it's own right :)
B0000024LN|5.0|This album is a symbolic metaphor of the muddy amniotic liquid of that kind of mother, that unconsciously wants to destroy the foetus. Sometimes the liquid gets muddy and there is fetal suffering and the foetus (the unborn child )has to decide to try hard to survive in that muddy liquid, between the life and the death. If the unborn child refuses to yield ( it's a free individualo choice ), he will born without physical injury ! This is the third release of this rapper of the New Jersey, Redman a.k.a. Reggie Noble, a.k.a. Funk Doctor and it's not a case that he is a Funk doctor, because the foetus, in that situation, has to be doctor of himself. So Redman, in this album, representes all the unborn children that have decided to resist the bad maternal attacks. Fot these reasons, this album is highly recommended by me, and it is just for winning persons. Here you are guaranteed and protected by the mortal masochism of those rappers that want and like to die or to hurt themselve  BEATS : 10/10 LYRICS: 10/10 My favorite tracks and the best tracks : # 2,3 6,11,23 (with Jamal a.k.a. Mally G of the Illegal).  P.S.: Please check up my rap listmania, just clicking on my nickname and clicking above my listmania. Here there are 40 Hip-Hop albums choosed by me just for winning people and not for fans of the mortal masochism rap !!! I assure that in my rap albums'list you will find the best American Hip-Hop albums. There are dance beats and strong ones and lyrics just for  the winning person in the life !!!
B000LC4TJ0|2.0|This production of \\"Figaro\\" has to rank as one of the most ungainly ever staged. Although it has a cast of distinguished singers, they are sabotaged by a conductor bent apparently on proving the old canard that Mozart's music has too many notes. Perhaps this is why he lingers unduly over each one, moving through the score at an elephantine pace. Similarly, the stage director has eliminated whatever in the text is light, bright and sparkling, matching the conductor in weighing down this sharp comical satire with an inappropriate dourness. I agree with earlier critics of this DVD, wishing only that I'd read their comments before I purchased it. Question: Are there any productions from M22 that seek to do other than be ugly and boring in novel ways?
0375757422|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel.  Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage.  In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want.  She is rich, pretty, and happy.  She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her.  The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station.  Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.    I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like.  I would have to disagree with that.  Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place.  Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them.  I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.    Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written.  Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude.  Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader.  Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.    In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels.  It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues.  The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|C'mon, admit it. You listened to this album and you were scared. Don't be. I know, you want your nicely packaged pop music, you want to hear an ablum you've already heard before. You won't find it here. These songs will make you boogey, they'll make you dance and they'll scare your dog. I particularly like the songs \\"I'm a designer,\\" and \\"Suture up your future.\\" I'm sure you'll have your own favorites. This is probably Josh Homme and CO's best album sense \\"R.\\" It has it's own style, it's got it's own thing going for it. I don't think that \\"I wanna make it with 'chu\\" was a necessary remake, although I can understand desire to file it under the Queen's catalog for reasons unknown to most of us. Great album, I love it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Many people don't care for this album because it doesn't sound like it was made in a garage.  Those people who fell in love with the Metallica of the 80s know what they used to sound like, and many of them never forgave the band for evolving.  S&M is incredible, it is meant to be heard and felt.  No one can deny the power that Metallica wields, but add the emotion and power of an orchestra, and it turns into something else.  In my opinion both the band and the orchestra turned it up a notch for this recording.
B000EJNVMQ|5.0|I love it.  It is definitely a big watch but it is a lot of fun to wear.  I am a righty and still wear it on my left wrist.  I found that the dial bothers me on the right hand. Great Sunday funday watch.
B000002UTY|5.0|I went in expecting an album with an old, lackluster guitar sound and uninteresting guitar playing because, let me be honest, there's a lot of guitar playing from the 60's that doesn't sound good to me.  Let me take that back- it SOUNDS good, but the notes aren't inspiring me to continue listening because it's mostly a guitar soloing or jamming over simple blues rhythms and whatnot.  It's alright in small doses, but not in great quantities for me.      However, Happy Trails is just the opposite.  The reviewer below is right- if you like the Grateful Dead's \\"Live/Dead\\" album or even some of the spookier Doors moments when they are letting loose and jamming out, this album won't disappoint.  Throw in some melodic guitar jams with lots of delicious licks and really good and unpredictable bass work, and you got yourself a quality album.      Even if you don't care for the versions of \\"Who Do You Love\\" that you may have heard, you can ignore all those versions because this is a VERY different song.  It takes the theme of that song and expands and builds on the melody in various guitar jamming ways.  It honestly reminds me of live Country Joe and the Fish.  \\"Calvary\\" is like a highly creative and drastically different approach to a western theme by building it around a lengthy, melodic guitar jam.  I've honestly never heard anything remotely like it before.      An album created to satisfy all the guitar jam fans out there.  It's awesome.  A must buy.
1400032717|5.0|I'll never forget reading this. It is wonderful, especially if you work with or know kids who are \\"interesting\\" Buy this and keep it. You won't be disappointed.
B000002VCZ|4.0|I must say that \\"Days Are Numbers\\" is an incredible ballad. The harmonies (like when they hit 'Some-day' in this song, are just drop dead gorgeous. The lead is soft and perfect, the lyrics hauntingly true to my own life, and this is one of the most played slow songs of my iTunes these days.  Call it perfect pop, but it's just a smooth beautiful song in my opinion. Tell me true, if a great friend asked you to slow dance to this song, in a darkened hall with lights above, wouldn't you just go on and on ?
B000RW3YYA|5.0|This one kicked off to a good start since there were some really good story-lines in it. I think that if there were 2 drawbacks in this season then it would be that they brought in the episodes on they're encounters with that narcisstic man in the episodes \\"Irrisistable\\" and \\"Irresponsible\\" but other than that the season turned out really well. It was also a good idea that they brought in an old favorite from the original show for 3 episodes as well, I especially liked the cliff-hanger when they brought the team back together and fought for their city and home. All in all, I recommend this one to any who like the series and look forward to the following season.
0393327655|5.0|The End of Faith\\" constitutes a valuable public conversation in that it says much that needs to be said. The style is clear and lucid, the work meticulously sourced.<br /><br />Harris's primary theme involves the need to call the core doctrines of faith into question.<br /><br />Ever the polemicist,he is particularly hard on Muslims, seeming to consider them essentially lost to reason. He states that, \\"Given what Muslims believe is genuine peace in this world possible? ...I'm afraid that encouraging answers to such questions are hard to come by (p. 137).\\" He provides copious Koranic quotes condemning the non-believer; quotes that are similar in their hatefulness to those found in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.<br /><br />The misdeeds of murderous Muslim fanatics are well known. They are reprehensible and are and should be actionable. Yet human variability is too great to justify condemning a billion people en masse, no matter their religious persuasion. The vile adherence to Koranic claptrap Muslims espouse must eventually change. After all, Muslims, as Harris acknowledges, were making important contributions to humanity, particularly in the areas of math, astronomy and the preservation of ancient knowledge when Western Civilization was little more than a cesspool of theologically induced ignorance and brutality. Islamists may yet have their own enlightenment, particularly if significant numbers of them attain a sound education in a secular US or elsewhere.<br /><br />Harris seems to insist in circumlocutions that are nothing if not artful that our depredations against Muslims are of little consequence. Even though I view these matters somewhat differently, Harris appears to be a perpetual student of the human condition, a thoughtful person who may see some of these issues differently with the passage of time. And then again I may.<br /><br />With Laser-like accuracy Harris states that that \\"The degree to which religious ideas still determine (the) government policies...of the United States--presents a grave danger to everyone (p. 153).\\" Certainly Christians in the United States have much to atone for. As Harris notes, forty percent of George W. Bush's voter support came from fundamentalist Christians. Thus we have a president who describes himself as a \\"messenger\\" of God who is doing \\"the Lord's will.\\" One might more readily expect a Grand Poobah of Pakistan or Nigeria to announce that God is whispering in his ear, an anomaly that almost moves even the rationalist to pray for regime change. One can reasonably argue then, that voters of the fundamentalist Christian persuasion more than any other group visited upon us the tragedy that is Iraq, with its millions dead or wounded and over four million people as refugees. War in the Middle East, after all, is enthusiastically embraced and encouraged by Christian Evangelicals to \\"usher in the Second Coming of Christ and the final destruction of the Jews (p. 153).\\" Additionally, we now deficit spending greater than any in the history of humanity (Clap your hands and say thank you, Mister Jesus!). Our military is corrupted by what Air Force vet Mikey Weinstein terms \\"an evangelical coup in the military.\\" The wall of separation between church and state that was so artfully constructed by the founders, them at most mildly affirmative deists, is tragically undermined.<br /><br />Harris says, \\"victimless crimes\\" are outgrowths of faith-based thinking, noting that prohibition and the Drug War began with Christian groups. With no victim, though, he states, there is no crime. One appreciates then the implication that Harris supports the right of people to do that which they wish to do in private.<br /><br />The total absence of magical thinking is likely to be a long time coming, though, and this is true whether it's that of a coven of nude witches dancing around a fire in a moonlit glade beseeching the Goddess or a gaggle of Southern Baptists insisting that those crumbled up saltine crackers are momentarily going to become the neurological, muscle and integumental tissues of Sky Boy Jesus.<br /><br />In the meantime, this reader is left feeling that society is served best by religious pluralism coupled with a high tolerance for harmless eccentricity, this including the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart's fevered rush to a hot sheets motel with a sex worker or Rev. Ted Haggard and his catamite slathering on the K-Y Jelly in preparation for a convivial amphetamine-fueled boy-on-boy Bacchanal.<br /><br />If there was any great lesson in the tragedy of 09.11.01, it is that religion and politics are an explosive and irresponsible combination, one that is eventually paid for in blood. With whatever small flaws it may have, \\"The End of Faith\\" makes a good case for this.

B000089RVX|1.0|This album is a bunch of teenage overdramatic crap. Amy Lee's vocals are too overdramatic, and most of the lyrics sound like what would come out of a teenagers jounral about how depressing things are. I can't belive some people call this metal or goth music, it is neither. This album is way too comericalized, the music is itself is nothing too write home about. Alot of this album sounds like it was thrown together in about 5 minutes, with not much thought behind it. If you want TRUE metal stick with old school metallica, megadeth,testament,pantera(r.i.p. Dimebag),slayer,and fear factory. Avoid this album if you are a TRUE metal fan, you will be dissapointed.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I can see why Helen Mirren won an oscar for her role as the Queen.  This was a terrific movie and gives one a little more insight into the British royalty, how she was brought up, and how she coped with the expectations of others in regard to Princess Diana's funeral.  Truly a remarkable movie.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Overall a great back to basics James Bond film.  In addition to Daniel Craig taking on the role of Bond, the film greatly limits computer generated special effects and we are presented with a slightly more mean spirited and almost humorless bond.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a significant change to the Bond character.  In CASINO ROYALE he is more like Charles Bronson's character in THE MECHANIC or Clint Eastwood in PALE RIDER.  Missing are the largely humerous quips and self assured posturing at casino tables.  Craig's portrayal of Bond is probably closer to Sean Connery's original Bond in DOCTOR NO.  CASINO ROYALE'S bond freely uses his semi-automatic pistol.  Previous Bonds, following FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, always seemed to lose their pistols at the outset of a fight.  In all honesty it will probably take two or three films to get used to Daniel Craig as Bond.<br /><br />Gone too are the humorous foils with no sign of John Cleese or any reincarnation of \\"Q.\\"  Judi Dench returns as \\"M.\\"  Dench already established her character in prior Bond films as a no-nonsense administrator.  As such, there is very little difference in Dench's portrayal of \\"M\\" in CASINO ROYALE.<br /><br />In ROYALE we are treated to an alterante Bond universe in that the film is about Bond's first mission, set in the current era, as a double-O agent.  As such we find an arrogant and self-confident Bond whose foibles often lead to learning curve hubris.  He is not the automatic winner-takes-all at the gaming table and allows his emotions to lead him astray on several occasions.  In fact he initially comes off as the bad boy of the double-O's.<br /><br />The action sequences in this movie are more akin to Bruce Willis in the DIE HARD movies, albeit with additional stamina.  Yes, there are the trade mark fast cars, beaches, millionaire resorts and casinos that most of us can only dream about.  What would Bond be without jetsetting?<br /><br />The movie's only drawback is that it becomes unnecessarily complicated.  When I saw the film for the first time I felt as if I needed to have a line and block diagram to tie together all of the inserted characters, relationships and locations.  At the conclusion of the picture I was not sure what victory had been won for Queen and country.  Still, this is a good outing for a re-tooled Bond.  Hopefully future films will keep to this back to basics theme and stay away from stories with ice palaces, underground megaplexes, and gray-suited masterminds who have it all, but want more.the first time I felt as if I needed to have a line and block diagram to tie together all of the inserted characters, relationships and locations.

B00009MGQL|5.0|I bought this CD two days back and had time yesterday to tune in the night expecting some classical outfit with blues-rock just like what Jeff comes up with in his solo efforts which is purely classical!<br /><br />But this one is absolutely different as Jeff had taken care of each and every arrangements being one many army. The album starts off with a number called \\"So What\\" which will rock you down the bottom with high-pitched guitar and electronic sounds followed by other tracks like \\"Plan B\\" \\"Pork-u-pine\\".<br /><br />I am mainly into Jazz, Blues, Rock, Funk and have a large extensive and varied collection of music listening for past 17 years. This album is something very different which I enjoyed the most albeit it's heavy!!<br /><br />You don't have to think twice to buy an album of Jeff as all Jeff's freak are aware of what he can do. So try it out!! That's all I have to say.<br /><br />Ciao and and enjoy folks!!!!
0375759174|4.0|Northanger Abbey is a classic in several senses of the word:  It's pure Jane Austen; it's set in the early 1800s, mostly in a Gothic abbey; it's dramatic and overwrought and wonderfully written.  Any Austen fan  who has not yet picked up this little gem of a novel should do so immediately because you are sure to be delighted!<br /><br />Catherine Morland, aged 17, is expanding her horizons by visiting Bath with her neighbors, The Allens.  While there, she becomes entangled with the Thorpe family, who are not quite what they seem to be, and the Tilney family, with whom she forms a sincere attachment that leads her to visit their family home, Northanger Abbey.  Catherine has spent a good deal of time reading novels, and she allows her imagination to run wild once she finds herself in the dark corridors of the abbey; the appearance of Henry, her hopeful love interest, helps quell her theatrics a bit but she still finds herself drawn into situations she doesn't understand.  Classic Austen includes misunderstanding and love, and this novel has both in abundance.<br /><br />This is a slim novel, and from what I gather, one of Austen's earliest.  The characterizations are not perhaps as finely tuned as some of her other works, but overall this is a satisfying read with the delights of the time period.  Sit back, curl up, and enjoy!
B000001E3V|5.0|This is by far the best Derek and Dominos concert I have ever heard though some of you can differ with my viewpoint. However, from my point of view it is a great blues live album recorded live at Fillmore on 23rd and 24th October 1970. It is said that the band was not aware of that the show had got recorded. It is our good fortune to listen to this album.<br /><br />The CD contains two disc of which the CD 1 is fantastic with tracks like \\"Got to get better in a little while\\", \\"Why does lover got to be so sad?\\" and others.<br /><br />This is a must buy CD!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|As a fan of both Anime and Daft Punk this item is just about as good as it gets. At first it seems like a beautiful way to present a musical album, a nice screensaver as it were. However after watching this a few times and really embracing the story and relating the scenes to the lyrics or melody, Interstella 5555 becomes quite a moving experience. You will travel through a range of emotions with each song, uplifted and happy with \\"One More Time\\" to quiet and emotional with \\"Something About Us\\". My favourite track is \\"Face To Face\\", and it always tugs at my heart-strings towards the end.    Beautiful picture. I rate it alongside \\"The Castle of Cagliostro\\" as my all time favourite Anime films.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|For a while, I was worried about the fate of my beloved Stripes. First, Get Behind Me Satan was released, which was a good record but not up to par with their previous records in my opinion. They went with a new direction,using more pianos than guitars. I thought this path was interesting, but it just didn't have the usual gusto for a White Stripes record. Than Jack White decided to start up a new band, the Raconteurs. They were great, but I was worried that the Stripes might never release another record.        Then I heard they were releasing the new album Icky Thump, and I waited with baited breath for it to come out. It finally did, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This could be their best album yet! Jack White is back shredding his guitar (yay!), Meg is back pounding her simple beats(yay!); but this time they've thrown in bagpipes and horns to make some awesome songs (triple yay!). Every song rocks (except in my opinion, Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn). My favorite songs are Conquest, St. Andrew, and Rag and Bone. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys alternative music, and of course White Stripe fans.
B000002OAZ|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD.  Unlike other reviewers who didn't appreciate Hubert Sumlin playing rhythm guitar and Clapton playing lead, Howlin' Wolf and Mr. Sumlin, both tried and true together, give way to some new blues followers, and thank God.  Look what has become of Eric as a blues front man!  Not to mention the mark the Stones and Steve Winwood have left on the blues scene.  I love the humbleness shown here.  Also, if you watch Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD from Dallas 2004, you will note Hubert Sumlin featured as a blues great playing along side Clapton, Buddy Guy, BB King, Robert Cray and Jimmy Vaughn.  This CD is fantastic, I recommend it to any blues lover.
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club MUST be seen twice to be truly understood. Can't say more than that, it would ruin the fun.<br /><br />This film was way ahead of its time in its devastatingly exact portrayal of the emptiness of its time. Give this puppy a few decades and it will be seen as perhaps the finest celluloid expression of millenial ennui/nihilism. The violence is entirely necessary to the experience, and this isn't the standard defense-industry-sponsored Hollywood Gun Porn; it's straight-up bare-knuckle brawling, and its visceral point hits home hard. In the anesthetized homogenized consumerist vacuum of a culture that we call home, it takes at least a few solid shots to the jaw to begin to wake up from our American Dream/Nightmare.<br /><br />Fight Club was widely panned upon release, and no wonder. This is one of the most subversive major studio films of all time, intelligently deconstructing modern film and the entertainment/distraction industry in general. Fight Club's heroes blow up the headquarters of credit card companies (!) in a decidedly unapologetic way...not really the message our Feudal Lords wish us to ponder while being entertained. Why not buy a copy on your Mastercard just for kicks, but whatever you do don't burn it for everyone you know just because the message of this film is more important than making money for the system this flick slams at every turn.<br /><br />So many hidden details, so much black humor (the Ikea lifestyle catalog scene is brilliant), three excellent lead performances, tremendous writing (Palahniuk must have been thrilled with the adaptation), a wild score, state of the art editing, sets, and direction, and so much more.<br />But, and this can not be overstated, you absolutely have to see it twice; the second viewing is a completely different animal, and will make you realize how thoroughly manipulated we are by modern culture, no matter how above and beyond it we think we may be.<br /><br />For a culture constantly and adoringly staring up its own ahole, Fight Club is a satisfyingly violent enema.satisfyingly violent enema.

B000OCXFCO|3.0|If you're an Megadeth fan then you need to own this album simply to complete you collection but \\"The System Has Failed\\" was much better.  A few of the tracks really grab you, but then some just annoy the hell out you.

0596007124|5.0|This book is an extremely clear and readable introduction to design patterns. It has serious content and is not too goofy so that it becomes distracting.    While the sample code is in Java (and will help you gain more appreciation for the language) the concepts will apply to other languages equally well.    Definitely one of the best and most approachable books on this subject. Highly recommended if you want to learn about design patterns.
B000P2A24W|3.0|HAVE A NICE DAY was probably the best Bon Jovi album since NEW JERSEY. After the success of the country version of \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home,\\" the guys decided to stick around Nashville for a while and turned out their next album from there. LOST HIGHWAY isn't really a strict country album, but the influence is clearly evident and results in a rather disappointing album. A couple songs still have that Bon Jovi rock sound, but others are just too country. Not that I dislike country (I love it), but I like my Bon Jovi rocking. \\"Lost Highway,\\" \\"Summertime\\" and \\"We Got It Going On\\" (featuring backing vocals by Big & Rich, the worst duo in country music history) are the standout tracks. Overall, this is more Bon Jovi Light, best suited for country fans who might like Bon Jovi but not their rock sound. It's okay, but hopefully next time the boys will return to New Jersey, get back to their rock sound, and turn out a worthy follow-up to HAVE A NICE DAY.
B000268QB2|4.0|I got this CD mainly for \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" after hearing Blake Lewis sing it.  But I like other songs on this cd too.  Band is different than anything here in the US, and I like their way of singing and playing music.  I have to say, I like the cd that they made after this one, even better.
B000ARTMUC|5.0|Fun entertainment on the run. PSP is great to kill time while waiting for anything. The stargate movie is great sci-fi action suitable for young kids.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Great cd.  I knew when I heard him sing Make a Memory on American Idol, that I would have to pre-order this cd from Amazon.    I appreciate his hard work in songwriting, and creating a different kind of music than he's already put out there.    He's still hot after all these years.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|A little too much gore and violence for me. Definitely not something I'd have my children watch. If I could go back It's something I'd probably would've never bought. Thought of giving it away but didn't want my friends to watch this gore either.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|A very funny, occasionally moving and at times disturbing look at a typically dysfunctional family on a road trip to a beauty contest for pre-pubescent girls. The entire cast is great - Alan Arkin (who is hilarious) won the Oscar, but really any one of the six could have won.  What I like about Little Miss Sunshine the most is that it's a feel-good movie that never feels corny or manipulative.  The reason being that hovering around the sunshine the film casts are the dark clouds of depression, suicide, drug abuse and failure.  The film could be just as easily depressing and dark as it could be sappy and sentimental, but the two polar opposites  keep the  other in check and create a fun, quirky atmosphere.  The film isn't perfect - its comments on beauty pageants and America's obsession with winning seem a bit forced, contradictory and weigh down everything else.  Despite its flaws, I dare you to watch Little Miss Sunshine without cracking a smile and feeling good.  Recommended.
B000BRBA8S|2.0|The idea that another viewer might spend more than two non-returnable hours watching this well-acted, beautiful and pretentious film was enough for me to overcome my reluctance to comment on it.<br /><br />Two brief points:<br /><br />1.) This film was shot without a script. This will not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen it.<br /><br />2.) In the DVD extras, actress Ziyi Zhang (who plays Bai Ling) confesses with a nervous laugh, \\"None of us knew what the film was about.\\"
B000OCXMAE|1.0|LP has been my favorite band since hybrid theory and all the way until after collision course. when i found out they were finally coming out with another actual album (none of the remix stuff) i was amped. the cd comes out and it is horrible. basically every song is like a ballad and the rock songs they do have just suck. they lost all their epicness and moved to crap.i think it's safe to say that this is one of the worst albums ever
B00009W0U4|4.0|The title of my review is no joke. This is a harsh film that should be treated as such.  It is a grueling tale told from end to beginning, like that of \\"Memento.\\"<br /><br />It's dizzy effects in the beginning fade to subtle as the story unravels itself.  Be warned that the first half of the movie is extremely violent from scenes of a bloody beating to a horrific-ly realistic rape scene involving Monica Bellucci's character.<br /><br />As jarring as the movie is, it should not be swept under the carpet as some celloid trash.  It delves deep into one's being and makes the viewer say, \\"That couldn't possibly happen in 'real' life.\\" Yet, revenge is very real in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Kudos to Ms. Bellucci for taking on such a dramatically daring role that no other \\"Hollywood\\" actress would even dare to do.  It seems so real what is happening to her you want to cry and/or kick the hell out of the man that brutalizes her.

0684800713|2.0|I've often wondered how I got through college as an English major without reading any Hemingway. The classics have always been my favorites, and American lit specifically. So, as an adult, I've tried to add some of those critically acclaimed books I missed in undergrad to my \\"Have Read\\" list. The first Hemingway book I read post-college was A Farewell to Arms. I liked it ... not loved, but liked it enough to read more of his work. But this one ... I struggled through it. I felt like each page was the same -- group of friends who don't all like each other and lots and lots of alcohol. I did make it to the end despite my minimal interest in the story (or lack there of) because, no matter what the story is, Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is a great example of a true gift.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is an update to the original posting. Amazon won't let me review this edition, since I did a review for the original, which I gave a 5 star. So, with this ediiton I give a 1 star. Please read below.      I absolutely LOVED the series and LOVED this movie. This review is ONLY on this recycled version of Serenity and NOTHING else.    I bought this version, to go along with the original version, hoping it would contain all the \\"extra cool\\" features, such as the story of River's background, as well as all the \\"extra footage\\" that was claimed to be on this version. After all, it had TWO discs. All I can say is; save your money. If you have the original version, you don't need this. All the bonus material, for the most part, is already on the original cut. I was expecting a longer version of the movie, you know, like a director edition that contained all the \\"bonus material\\" and edited scenes, much like they advertised on this version. Nope. It's the same movie, same version, same everything. To charge full price for this was ridiculous. I don't if Joss is just trying to squeeze a little more juice/money, out of this series or what. But it's a really sad attempt at repacking. Oh, and as for the back-story to River...what a joke.    A little more on the bonus material; I try and catch anything I can about Firefly. As I said, I LOVED this show, but how much do we have to hear Joss talk about himself and continually be the focal point of every bonus featurette? Yes, Roddenberry was very much like that with Star Trek, but at least he knew when to stop talking at let the actors do the bonus stuff. Plus, Star Trek is a phenomenon, Firefly, unfortunately, is not.    If you don't have the original edition of Firefly, most defiantly, get this version, it does have cooler packaging. Otherwise, don't waste your money. You'll be very upset if you do.                Although knowing the series before seeing the movie is really the best way to go, this movie does stand on it's own.  It's a bit fast paced to keep up with if you don't know the details of the characters, plots, and flow of the series, but it is a wonderfully filmed and played out movie.  I was vary happy with the storyline of the reavers and what \\"made\\" them.  Perfectly laid out to mankinds tinkering.      Thank you Josh for giving us your imagination and this \\"baby\\" that you created called \\"Firefly,\\" and to the extension of that series.  One can only hopy that there, one day, will be enough spark to light the fire once more.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|A previous reviewer calls 'After the Wedding' a tale of 'stupendous coincidence.'  I love that phrase.  Indeed, that's what the key event in this movie feels like.  The thing is, though, it's simply not the case.  Over time, we learn and see that Rolf Lassgård's Jørgen is anything but a man to leave things to coincidence.  The viewer is let in to slowly see his charm, his shrewdness, his business acumen...and the little scheme he's put into play between his family and Jacob, as portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen ('Le Chiffre' to 'Casino Royale' fans).<br /><br />As for Mikkelsen, what can I say?  He's Denmark's George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, all rolled into one.  The guy can act, too.  You'll see the phrase 'soap opera' used on these pages.  In the hands of lesser actors, yes.  But not with Mikkelsen and Lassgård - their performances are what landed this film on this year's Oscar nominee list.  [As good as it is, no way it was going to win out over 'The Lives of Others' - to me, that's the best single film of the decade so far.]
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It was a crying shame when this show was taken off the air.  I remember the day it came out, and the day it went off the air.  Look at how many people have reviewed this series and it stills casts 5 stars after 3000+ votes.     I think if the network would have let it go a full season it would have picked up an even bigger following.  This show was so unique and different then \\"regular\\" space shows that it has to be truely witnessed to understand and truely appreciate it.  I think the following is even larger now because of the movie.  People wanted to bone up on it to fully follow the movie, (but even the movie could pretty much stand up on it's own) so when others \\"discovered\\" the 13 episodes, I think that created an even bigger cult following.  However, I think even the movie was only half-heartedly promoted by the corporate execs, and hence the even lower ROI then coulda/shoulda been made.    I don't think there is enough juice in the system to do another extension to the series, but with such a large and growing following, I'm hoping, one day, there will at least be another movie.      Again, such a crying shame that this show, as well as one of my other favorites, Farscape, just didn't last longer.
0793518326|2.0|I have to say I'm exceedingly disappointed with this book.   Not so much the content, but the packaging and rendering.  It's about the size and shape of and bound like the average collegiate dictionary.   That's fine for a dictionary where you open it, look up a word, and close it.  But this format is totally unsuitable for a music book that you would want on a piano or music stand.  And like a dictionary, the print is tiny.  For me it's too small to try to follow and learn while playing an instrument.  And, again, because of its binding it doesn't even lend itself to placing on a copier and enlarging.  I'm even contemplating cutting the pages out with a razor so I can feed them into a copier and enlarge.    The Beatles music is a lot of material to cover and the author did a good job of compiling it.  But it really needs to be split across multiple volumes, printed on large paper, and spiral bound to lay flat on a music stand.
B00005QIPH|2.0|This is mediocre rock'n'roll. Nothing particularly great about it in any way. It will remain one of the mysteries of live how this group and this album got so hyped up.

1594489505|5.0|\\"And that, my young friends, is the story of our country, one invader after another ... But we're like those walls up there.  Battered, and nothing pretty to look at, but still standing.\\"<br /><br />Following up a great first novel is no easy task, and many writers fall victim to the so-called \\"sophomore slump\\".  Not Khaled Hosseini.  In his second novel he sticks with what he does best - a riveting portrait of Afghanistan from the 1970s to the present day centered around compelling human drama.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is the story of Mariam, a harami (or illegitimate) girl who longs for her father's love and acceptance, and Laila, an indomitable beauty whose love for her childhood friend Tariq is the driving force behind her determination and will.  The two women's fates are intertwined after both end up forced by circumstance and/or family into a marriage with the abusive Rasheed.  Through Mariam and Laila's eyes we witness the deterioration of their homeland in a way that we couldn't in Hosseini's previous novel, \\"The Kite Runner\\".  That is because while Amir, the protagonist of \\"Kite Runner,\\" left Afghanistan for America and only returned when the transformation from peaceful nation to violent bed of terrorists was complete, Mariam and Laila are trapped there during the whole bloody mess of regime changes, bombings, executions, droughts, and diseases.  As women, they have no rights and seemingly no control over their own fates - forced to stay in a wasted city where death lurks around every corner and any deviation from the rules will get them a violent rebuke from the government and/or their husband.  The odds are hopelessly stacked against them, but through their friendship Mariam and Laila find the strength to endure.  Their love for each other and their tarnished homeland - which they dream to see rebuilt one day - is the life force that gets them through the years, and from it they draw reserves of strength, wisdom, and compassion that they never believed they possessed.  Downtrodden and beaten, Mariam and Laila carry on with an inner light just like that of their beloved city of Kabul in an old poem from which Hosseini derives his title: \\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs / Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\\"<br /><br />Sophomore slump?  Not here; if anything, Hosseini has raised his game and written an even better novel than the already great \\"Kite Runner\\".  To be honest, there are a couple of awkwardly structured sentences and overused commas, but in an otherwise stellar novel this is easily forgivable.  So put [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" on your must-read list, and join those of us who are waiting with great anticipation for Hosseini's next effort.  I, for one, can't wait to see what he comes up with next.<br />Grade: Apossessed.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I know my review title is corny but I just wanna get to the point. \\"Lost Highway\\" is an awesome CD. IN mid-2006 I had read on the internet about BJ making a country record and I thought to myself they already did one song (Who Say You Can't Go Home) that they converted country and it was great but I hope they aren't gonna really do this. Well I've always been a gigantic Bon Jovi fan and I was really unsure about this. I waited until (you want to) make a memory came out and I loved it. as different as it was i really loved it. So I bout the albu june 20 and Was amazed how much better it was. As much as I love ywtmam It can't really compete with the other songs one here.     \\"Lost Highway\\" - A fast paced easy going song about breaking free and finding your way. (My favorite song)  \\"Summertime\\" - Another face paced song more on the fun side about love and fun and having a good time in the summertime.  \\"Make A Memory\\" - A slow mellow love song about love duh. It's beautiful. You'll either Love it or hate it. There is no in between.  \\"Whole Lot of leavin'\\" - A song that starts out slower and then picks up quickly about the ones you love leaving. I swear it seems like the music itself is remenicing.   \\"We Got It Going On\\" - This one Big & Rich play with Bon Jovi and it completely rocks. If you want to see the old bon jovi, this song takes you back from \\"One Wild Night\\" to \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" It's the perfect Football anthem. You have to love it.  \\"Any Other Day\\" - This one starts kinda mellow and picks up in the chorus. I'm not quite sure if this is about having a bad day but normally having a good day or a good day normally having a bad. I think it's the second one. But It's an awwsome some  \\"Seat Next To You\\" - This is the perfect ballad. \\"Baby, I want you to take me, wherever you're going to. Maybe, say that you'll save me, a seat mext to you.\\" it's undiniable  \\"Everybody's Broken\\" - This song is kinda bouncy, it's fits the song 'I Am\\" on the \\"Have A Nice Day\\" album but its a little brighter.   \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" - This is the duet with Leann Rimes. It is absolutely beautiful. thats all i can say. It will be a hit.  \\"The Last Night\\" - This one is upbeat but light about the last night you'll be alone I really can't say the meaning cuz Its too many words unless I'm over thinking it and i think i am. I think. It great.  \\"One Step Closer\\" - It's about getting close to someone. It's beautiful just like the others. you'll see just buy it. it's kinda slow but it is jumpy.  \\"I Love This Town\\" - Just give this one a listen and you'll know what it's about instantly. Nashville.    All in all, afew songs stand out but at the same time, it's hard to say 'Hey that's gonna be a single\\" and I know that sounds so cliche' coming from a #1 Bon Jovi fan but it's true. They are all great they are all catchy. Just wait till they start releasing more singles. I predict five or six singles and all hits from this album. Unlike the last few great albums only releasing two or three. If they don't release 5 or 6 singles they are going psycho. If you like bon jovi buy this. you won't regret it. yes it has it's twang country song but it's only nashville influenced. Just buy it
B000PFUA9G|4.0|I'm quite a fan of Brad Paisley and I couldn't wait for this CD to be released.  He turned in another solid effort on \\"5th Gear.\\"  In my opinion, the best songs on the CD are: All I Wanted Was A Car, Ticks, Online, I'm Still A Guy, Oh Love, and Bigger Fish to Fry.  However there are a few misses on this CD as well.  To me this CD isn't as good as \\"Time Well Wasted.\\"  A good CD none the less and if you are a Brad Paisley fan you will certainly enjoy it.  A 4 star CD.
6305910340|5.0|Coaches, teachers, and parents of kids often make one of two errors in competitive activities:<br /><br />1. They try to convince their kids that winning is the only thing that matters.<br />2. They instill in their kids a great fear of losing.<br /><br />Josh Waitzkin is a young 7-year-old boy who enjoys playing the game of chess.  He's also a very nice, sweet kid who never feels comfortable or even enjoys \\"beating\\" an opponent.  He simply loves the game.  When he first plays his father in a game of chess, he doesn't try his hardest.  He's afraid of beating and hurting his father's feelings.  This part of the film lays the foundation for the entire rest of the film.  His mother has to tell him, \\"it's okay if you beat him.  You won't hurt his feelings.\\"  Only then does Josh play at his best and wins.<br /><br />Fred Waitzkin (Joe Mantegna) represents the first fear that I listed.  He's an extremely supportive father who is very proud of his son.  \\"He's better at this than anything that I will ever do in my whole life,\\" he says of Josh.  While his passion and support are strong, he falls into the trap of living vicariously through his son.  Winning is the most important thing to him.  When Josh loses a match to an \\"inferior\\" opponent, Fred is upset and can't understand why Josh lost.  He doesn't realize that Josh loves his father and only wants to please him.  It isn't until then that Fred realizes his mistake, and he finally encourages Josh to play for fun.<br /><br />On the other side is Josh's chess teacher, Bruce (Ben Kingsley).  He represents the second fear that I listed.  He is afraid of Josh losing.  Bruce is a man who is so scarred by his own losses that happened long ago, that he more or less \\"hides out\\" in an old chess room.  At first, Fred Waitzkin has to talk him into taking his son as a student.  While Bruce's demeanor is somewhat cold, it's obvious that he truly loves Josh, and can't bear the thought of Josh going through the pain of losing a match.  It isn't until the end that he realizes that Josh is really in no danger of this, even if he did lose.  Josh isn't greatly affected by either winning or losing.  He only likes to play.  But, Bruce tries to tell Josh that he needs to hold his opponents in contempt.  That type of notion simply doesn't exist in Josh.<br /><br />\\"Bobby Fischer held the whole world in contempt,\\" says Bruce.  Josh responds, \\"I'm not him.\\"  Josh already knows who he is, and he isn't trying to be the next Bobby Fischer, no matter how much everyone else wants him to be.  He only wants to be himself.<br /><br />There are two characters in this movie that already know Josh's heart, and they give him the positive values and support that Josh needs.<br /><br />First, his mother (Joan Allen).  She is so enamored by Josh's good heart, that at one point, she threatens her husband.  \\"He's not weak. He's decent. And if you or Bruce or anyone else tries to beat that out of him, I swear to God I'll take him away.\\"<br /><br />Second, is his friend Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a man that Josh meets in Washington Square where Vinnie spends his time playing speed chess with other people who are mostly transients.  Josh quickly makes friends with him, even though Bruce doesn't like it.  But, Vinnie holds the wisdom of competition that Bruce fails to give to Josh.  \\"You're playing not to lose, Josh.  You have to risk losing.  You have to play on the edge of defeat.  That's where you want to be!\\"<br /><br />I can't stress the performance of young Max Pomeranc (Josh Waitzkin) enough.  He seems to know exactly who Josh is, and he plays him with a gentle sweetness that can't be ignored or overlooked.  You see it in his eyes and facial expressions.  He looks at his opponents not as enemies, but simply another kid sitting across from him who could easily be his friend.  Josh has a well-balanced life.  Chess isn't everything to him.  He enjoys doing other things.  Perhaps this is a testament to why his character isso strong.  His opponent at the end, Jonathan Poe, thinks of only chess, and we quickly find that he is a very unhappy and miserable kid.  He's the kind of player that Bruce tries to make Josh, and we are thankful that Josh never goes down that road.<br /><br />Competition is so strong in our culture.  Most parents, teachers, and coaches fall into these two fears without realizing it.  We push and push, we forget that they are children, and that we need to stress the importance of having fun, being a good sportsman, and being gracious in victory and defeat.  It's truly amazing to find that Josh Waitzkin already realized this at the tender age of 7.  Hopefully, we can begin to pass these values on to our own kids.<br /><br />Note* - Look for the real Josh and Vinnie during a scene when the movie Josh and Vinnie are playing chess in the park.  The real Josh Waitzkin and Vinnie are talking just in front of Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna.so strong.

B000002JEV|5.0|This CD is a must have for any Zepplin fan.  I do not think that there is any better Zepplin album which demonstrates the improvisational attitude the band had in its early years.  With 3 versions of \\"Communication Breakdown\\" and 2 versions of \\"Dazed and Confused\\", this CD offers a unique opportunity to listen to songs with radically different sounds yet still be the same.  For me the almost 14 minute version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", with a \\"Boogie Chillun\\", \\"Fixin to Die\\", \\"That's Alright Mama\\", \\"A Mess of Blues\\" medley in the middle, makes the entire compilation priceless.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
0141023384|5.0|This is one of the best novels of the 1950s, recognized today as a classic, but perhaps assigned by the politically correct to represent African literature more than as fine literature. Achebe is a master craftsman. This piece reads well and then ends with a scathing revelation, shifting as it does from the warm, poetic \\"African\\" English of the Nigerian natives to the frigid, official rhetoric of the British colonial administrators. Okonkwo, the village hero, whose pride won't abide Christianized servility, has a dark side that tracks closely to that of British anti-heroes of the period. He reminds me of Albert Finney, running drunk along the back streets of Manchester, after slapping his girlfriend around. Okonkwo. too, likes to slap women around, which makes him rather unattractive, and he, too, drinks too much. One wonders if Achebe didn't pick up some of his plotting from the English novels of the period while a graduate student. Still, this is an elegant little novel, Achebe's best, and continues to pack a wollop.
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison's All Things Must Pass (1970) was the second triple album ever to reach the No.1 spot on the U.S. charts (Woodstock was first, and Wings Over America was the third in 1976). It's a rock classic, and it includes many of George's most spiritual songs, including, of course, My Sweet Lord.<br /><br />The album's texture and mood is sincere, sacred, and immaculate.  Phil Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" production helps to create that mood, giving the album an intensity and reverence that is most often found in a House of Worship.<br /><br />Other songs on the album, like Apple Scruffs, If Not for You, and the wonderful outtake, I Live For You, all have an English country music sound that features pedal steel guitar, harmonica, and acoustic slide guitar. All of these are real treats, and add to the album's variety.<br /><br />On the spiritual side, My Sweet Lord, Hear Me Lord, The Art Of Dying and Awaiting On You All are direct in their meaning of finding, knowing and loving God. Others, like All Things Must Pass, Isn't It A Pity and Beware Of Darkness, are also spiritual, but in a worldly, more practical way.<br /><br />All of these songs are very good, all are thought provoking, and George sounds great on every one of them. His excellent guitar playing is highlighted throughout (by the time George joined The Beatles, he was one of the hottest young guitar players in Liverpool), and his passionate search for knowing God more intimately seems genuine and pure.<br /><br />The album includes electric guitar fueled straight ahead rock n' roll, acoustic guitar based folk-rock music, and ballads with orchestration.<br /><br />There's an all-star jam session that includes Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Billy Preston and Dave Mason, among others, and although pretty good, it's really just a curiosity.<br /><br />There are some extra tracks included, and some are very good. The afore mentioned I Live For You, and an unplugged and passionate Let It Down are the best of these, but My Sweet Lord (2000) and an unplugged Beware Of Darkness are also very good.<br /><br />All Things Must Pass is a wise and spiritually uplifting musical experience, a rock classic that belongs in every music collection, and it's George Harrison's very best album. And ya gotta love that colorized album cover!re Of Darkness are also very good.     All Things Must Pass is a wise and spiritually uplifting musical experience, a rock classic that belongs in every music collection, and it's George Harrison's very best album.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Just got done watching, and I was blow away at this movie.  Gritty storytelling at it's finest.  The cinematography was outstanding.  Long camera sequences without breaks really puts you in the action.  And the story was outstanding.  Nothing cheesy about it, just a damn good dark but hopeful movie.  Highly recommended.
1596912855|4.0|Shh, now. We really don't want to let this one get out, but there's a subculture afoot in the world. And I, alas, am hopelessly mired in its tentacles. Most of us are women, but there are a few men in our ranks, and we have a secret in common, tucked away on our bookshelves and video collections.<br /><br />We are all hopelessly in love with Mr Darcy. Or rather, the most perfect manifestation of him in the form of Colin Firth.<br /><br />This slim novel opens with Jane Hayes having a conversation with her elderly aunt, a very wealthy woman at the tag end of her life. Jane is more than a little nervous about this conversation, having been pushed into it by her bullying mother who's hoping for a piece of the old woman's estate. Jane is both fascinated and humiliated by the conversation, but a few months later gets a phone call from a lawyer who informs her that she's been left something by her aunt.<br /><br />You're not rich, is the first thing that he says. But he does have a bit of a surprise for Jane -- an all-expenses paid holiday at a very private, very discreet resort in England for three weeks. Pembrook Park promises to fulfull the visitor's dreams of entering the world of genteel, simmering romance that the works of Jane Austen. After some qualms, and facing the fact that the trip is indeed, nonrefundable, Jane embarks on her trip. Perhaps now she can finally dispell her unrealistic fantasies of Mr Darcy and get on with her life; the solution is very simple, just immerse herself into the world of Austen until she is heartily sick of it, and disenchanted, and then she'll be free.<br /><br />It's not that easy, and Jane's already nervous when she arrives at the inn where she's to shed her modern persona and turn into Miss Jane Erstwhile. At first, it's rather amusing, dressing in the clothing of the period, and learning to dance with a very tall, good-looking, but alas, only a servant by the name of Martin. Under the rather draconian eye of Mrs. Wattlesbrook , Jane finds out that a few modern conveniences have been allowed in -- such as modern plumbing and cosmetics -- but alas, no cell-phone, so by the time she arrives at the actual Pembrook Park, there's a distinct aura of authenticity to her.<br /><br />And then there are the men -- three aristocratic men by the names of Colonel Andrews, Captain East and Mr. Nobley. Jane finds herself decidedly at the bottom of the leisured ladder, but still -- there's something about that Mr. Nobley that keeps them encountering each other, even though they throughly dislike each other. And despite knowing that it's all a game, Jane finds herself with two possible suitors -- and one of them is that gardener, Martin.<br /><br />But there's a limit to this pretty bubble, and as the clock winds down, whatever is Jane to do when her time is up and she has to return to the dull reality of the 21st century?<br /><br />I'll say it right off. It's a cute novel, and at times, just a bit too cute. But it worked for me, as I found myself chuckling over Jane's mishaps of trying to fit into a culture, but she can't quite keep her modern sensibilities at bay. Along the way there's some good pun, inside jokes for Jane Austen addicts, and a vivid writing style. One of the main reasons why I picked this one up is that it had a lot of appeal to me because I've been involved in historical re-enaction groups, and this one was no different. Hale's word-pictures of people trying to fit into a much more mannered time does get funny, as well as the synopsises of Jane's former boyfriends that introduce each chapter.<br /><br />At the core of the novel lay the truth of any person -- that with some confidence and the knowledge that you know what you want, it's a good bet you'll get what you want out of life. The humor is gentle in this one, and while it is aimed at a specific market, it should have a wide appeal to most adult readers.<br /><br />Hale is more familiar to readers of young adult fiction, but this one works. Her writing style is fluid and while the conversations get a bit stilted in places, and of course there's plenty of anachronisms in this, it still satisfies. My biggest complaint is that it could have easily been a longer novel, and I wish that Hale had taken the story a bit more in depth -- the novel is only about two hundred pages -- so it comes in overall at a tidy three and a half stars, rounded up to four.<br /><br />Recommended.s get a bit stilted in places, and of course there's plenty of anachronisms in this, it still satisfies.

B000KIBOUC|1.0|I recently bought the Nite Ize 1 Watt LED upgrade kit with intelligent switch for a 2 AA Maglite.  I was really impressed, worked amazingly well etc...     So I decided to try this LED ugrade kit for my 3D Maglite.  I was surprised how bad the LED is.  Like the other reviewer said, this LED upgrade is at least half as bright if not worse than the bulb it replaces.  Nite Ize should be ashamed to even sell this upgrade.  If you're looking for an upgrade, be sure that the LED states that it is at least 1 Watt or more, anything that doesn't state the brightness is obviously some old generation LED and not worth spending money on.  I returned this item immediately.

Fits snug into my Canon 30D.<br /><br />Only 4 stars (not 5) because paying this much for a piece of plastic kinda sucks, but I couldn't find one cheaper, so I had to bit the bullet, but I'm glad I did, so if you're looking for one, this works nicely.

Thanks to Christopher Tolkien for gathering these tales and making them available to the legions of his father's fans.
1594489505|4.0|First, let me start off by saying that I'm new to reading fiction. I haven't read \\"Kite Runner\\" and stick mostly with classics given my distaste for modern fiction.<br /><br />I found this book to be a wonderful story that has great style, great depth, and could be considered a great modern commentary on a troubled country. What I love about this book is how it tells you the story of Afghanistan at the same time of keeping up with the characters.<br /><br />This book is going to be a classic and will continue to sell very well, even through the Harry Potter craze.
B000P0J02E|4.0|I'm most definitely a Hans Zimmer fan.  I bought all 3 of the \\"Pirates\\" soundtracks as soon as they came out.  I have numerous other Zimmer soundtracks: my favorite being \\"The Rock\\".  Anyways, this soundtrack is pretty good.  All the tracks are great, and there isn't any tracks that don't fit, such as the techno song at the end of \\"Dead Man's Chest\\".  It ranks higher than \\"Curse of the Black Pearl\\", but can't quite overtake \\"Dead Man's Chest\\".  \\"What Shall We Die For\\" quickly followed by \\"I Don't Think Now is the Best Time\\" fit together perfectly and really have the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" final battle or \\"Narnia\\" final battle feeling.  \\"Up is Down\\" is also a great track.  Overall, I definitely suggest buying this soundtrack, as it is an excellent testament to the musical genius of Hans Zimmer.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|I was very excited about getting these DVD's and was certainly wowed by the photography and format. I was disappointed, however, with the absence of sources and/or commentary from bonafide scientists. Many segments also left me remarkably concerned that intrusive photographic techniques had actually caused the death of some of the animals being observed -- particularly a polar bear and a baby elephant. The entire series left me wondering about how invasive photographers were willing to become in order to get the \\"perfect\\" shot then not \\"clean up after themselves\\" by feeding an animal, turning it around, or repairing any damage that may have been done to the ecosystem involved in the process. Commentary -- even a bit of qualified \\"talking head\\" commentary might have helped my discomfort.

B00005JLF5|3.0|I never watched this show while it was on television.  I tried a few episodes here and there, but never watched it regularly.  However, in my DVD television watching, having finished Star Trek: TNG, I decided to give the first season a chance.  First, I must say this show got off to a better start than TNG.  The characaters, are set pretty well, and the tone of the show is fairly strong.  I liked the diffrent style of the show: nothing works right, the station is a cardassian vessel, the characters are not only not friends but in many cases don't like each other.  This show is very interesting, and I like the political nature of the show.  That being said, the first season does have many flaws.  First, the show does not do a whole lot of entertaining things.  Here, they have access to species 70,000 light years away, and all the races feel mainly like more of the same.  Odo is very interesting but little exploration of his character.  Also, the show attemptes a little too hard to rely on TNG characters.  Q and Luwaxana Troi felt out of their element.  That being said, I very much enjoyed the show.  I liked the exploration of the Ferengi culture, and feeling of the show getting better as the season progressed.  I liked the show, and have purchased the second season, looking foreward to see where the show goes.

B000002KHH|5.0|There is absolutely no reason this album should not be rated 5 stars.  It should be 6 stars, probably 7.  Its Sgt Pepper for metal.    Tony Iommi lost the ends of his fingertips, he shouldn't even be able to play the guitar.  I imagine they'll make a movie out of this fact someday.  For those of you who wonder how someone with prosthetics plays, he downtuned his guitar (the 'heavy' sound) and played riffs.  These two things established the sound of an entire genre that the world now labels as 'metal'.  Can anyone other band lay claim to something like that?    Ozzy gets extremely lucky, first with Iommi, then Rhoads, now Wylde.    Anyway, even if you don't dig metal as much as me or anyone else, you might still enjoy this.  War Pigs, Paranoid, and Iron Man.  The most famous Sabbath songs, all on one little disc thats so old you can get it dirt cheap now.    War Pigs also showcases on of the best guitar solos ever.
B000002L75|4.0|Although this is my 2d fav album of DM, I love it and every once in a while pop into my CD player in the car and jam to it. It amazes me how I've never heard \\"Lie to Me\\" anywhere other than when I play it. For me, it's one of their best songs ever. The musical composition is almost perfect. The lyrics, as usual, are deep and mesmerizing.   \\"Lie to Me\\" is one of my fav DM songs ever and probably the most underrated song DM has ever made.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Haven't got much to say about the songwriting etc - most of that has been covered adequately in other reviews.  My choice of 3 stars is due to the digital distortion that rears its ugly head through some of the songs on my copy of the album.  I have no idea where my copy comes from (not sure if they are manufactured here in New Zealand or are imported as ready made CDs from somewhere else) but the audio quality is lame!!  I bought the album on the strength of Andy Sneap's involvement, so I feel certain that the distortion cannot be his fault.  Somewhere in the post production process, one person too many has pushed the levels too far.  If I was Mustain I would be disappointed in the audio quality of the CD that is available in New Zealand at least.  I have ordered another copy and intend to A/B them.  I'll write something else about it when that happens.  So, the usual top marks to Megadeth for the music, but the audio quality is boyish at best.
B000P2A24W|4.0|When I recieved Lost Highway, I was terrified about how country Bon Jovi had gone. But when I listened to tracks like \\"Lost Highway\\", \\"Summertime\\", etc. I was surprised. There is a rock feel to the songs, but just with a little extra twang. It was not a disaster as I thought it would be. I really hope for the next album, they'll return to rock. But I must say Lost Highway was not a dissapointment. Bon Jovi still rocks, even when they explore their country side. Bon Jovi is the greatest band ever in my book, I mean, I'd still buy their albums, even if they went hip hop or rap!  I guess for a band that has lasted since 1984,you have to explore some new areas. But lets just hope that they return to what made them great. Good old hard rock! This album is a must buy for Bon Jovi fans. It mixes good old Bon Jovi rock with country. It's not their best album, that slot goes to Keep the Faith, but it is a very good CD.
159562015X|3.0|StrengthFinder 2.0 starts with a very interesting premise: We will succeed better in the workplace if we focus on our strengths rather than work on our weaknesses. To this end, it identifies 34 key talents, and provides a one-time online test to purchasers of the book, to find out what their 5 top strengths are.  So far, so good.  So why have I only given the book 3 stars?    1. This diagnostic is great for those who do not know themselves. For those of us who have gone through a battery of personality tests, and there are many of them free online (the MBTI is one), it doesn't appear to me to offer all that many new insights.  I am an INTP on the Myers Briggs test, also known as \\"The Thinker\\", and guess what, 4 of my top 5 talents according to StrengthsFinder are in the \\"thinking\\" category. (Tell me something new!)    2. While Strengthsfinder tells you your top 5 strengths individually, it doesn't consolidate all this information to tell you what this means on a consolidated basis.  It doesn't say for example like the MBTI the percentage of people who have my unique combination of talents, and what the combination of traits means in my interactions/ skillsets at work     3. It doesn't tell you what career you are best suited for given these particular talents    In short, it is useful but hardly earthshattering in insight; my advice is start with the free online MBTI tests, and if you have money to spare, get this book to see if the results tally.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Jonatham Demme's concert film captures the Talking Heads at the height of their powers in 1983.  Fans of the band will not be disappointed, and I don't think anyone else who comes to this film with an open mind, open ears, and open eyes will, either.  It begins with David Byrne alone on a bare stage, where he performs an acoustic version of \\"Psycho Killer\\" with a boom box providing the percussion.  The band members and supporting musicians come on stage, set up, and join in during succeeding numbers as the music becomes steadily more layered until we arrive at the explosively exhuberant performance of \\"Burning Down the House\\" that ends the picture.  Byrne's quirky personality, the exquisite musicianship of the band, the varied influences of the songs, and everyone's sheer love of making music are on full display here.  Highly recommended.

This is a very touching movie and true quality family fare.  Its a great movie to buy- we watch it over and over and over.
0151013047|4.0|I first saw and heard him six weeks ago at a book reading in the British Council in Delhi.<br /><br />His name is Mohsin Hamid.  He grew up in Lahore, Pakistan and studied at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, in the United States.  When he came on the stage I saw a slight man, with receding hair, glasses and a quiet air. He was introduced by the British Council staff and began reading. His voice was pleasant to the ear and without accent.<br /><br />Hamid read from the first chapter of his book, describing an on-campus interview with a large and successful firm that specializes in 'valuations' of firms up for acquisition.<br /><br />The book is written in first person, as a conversation between himself and an American stranger he encounters in a cafe in Lahore.  The conversation is his story and happens between dusk and nightfall.  I too finished it in two hours, between 10 PM and 12 AM.<br /><br />The story is about a young man, Changez, who is the amongst the best and brightest of his graduating class at Princeton, and his entry into the world of New York - his work, his meeting and getting to know a beautiful American woman called Erica, and his life in the exalted circles of the city, that Erica introduces him to. But, in the aftermath of September 11, his position in the city he has grown to love, changes.  Erica slowly disappears into her ghosts of the past and he begins to see his work through a new lens.  His identity shifts - unearthing allegiances more fundamental than power, money and love.<br /><br />Hamids' transformation of Changez - from a middle class well educated young man to someone who begins to be more questioning of what he had adopted so readily - is easy to understand. It evokes a classic dilemma that provokes a choice - between the supposed freedom and democracy of America, to the dictatorship and restrictions of Pakistan. Is this the clash of civilizations?<br /><br />Not really.  But, it is a difference of realities and perceptions. And, this difference is hard to bridge.  When events such as September 11 occur, they provide us with the opportunity to ask the most fundamental questions, of ourselves and those around us. Who am I? What do I stand for?  What do I believe in?  Who is my family, my community?  What is my country?<br /><br />People like Hamid and me, who span across at least two predominant cultures, are caught at the edge of each. Where do we belong?  I like to think of myself as a person who is comfortable with a leg in each and yet I want my own identity.  I won't let my country, family or people tell me what to think or how to behave. But, when I live in a culture that is predominantly the other, I may have to conform to that culture. I don't need to give up what I hold dear, but I need my ear to the ground in a way I don't in my own country.<br /><br />Changez leaves America, his job, and that world.  He returns to Pakistan and tries to make sense of what is happening around him. In many ways, he becomes more fundamental than he ever was.  Very reluctantly.<br /><br />The 184 page, double spaced book is riveting. It is sharp, the writing is tight and the descriptions perfect.  Not an extra syllable is used and the pace of the narrative brisk.<br /><br />This is Hamid's second book.  His first, Moth Smoke was published in ten languages and won many awards.  He also writes about politics from a Muslim perspective for Time, New York Times and the Guardian, among others.When events such as September 11 occur, they provide us with the opportunity to ask the most fundamental questions, of ourselves and those around us.

019280264X|5.0|Among Austen devotees, Pride and Prejudice is usually regarded as being her best work, but I admit that I think a little differently. While of course P&P is one of the great works of literature and certainly deserves its place in the Western canon, I am inclined to think that Mansfield Park, which in my mind is rivalled only by Persuasion, is just as deserving of that title.<br /><br />There are quite a few people that seem to think that Fanny and Edmund are much too dull to make a good hero and heroine, but I would beg to differ. Fanny is to me a very real character and not as woodenly perfect as she is sometimes made out to be- she can become angry, jealous and even occasionally depressed and the fact that she does not have the freedom to vent these negative emotions doesn't mean that she doesn't have the capacity or wish to. I have also heard it said that she doesn't have the courage to stand up for herself, but I would point out that she did so at the time that it was really important, even though it would have been much easier to go along with what her relations felt was best instead.<br /><br />Edmund also should be given the credit that he deserves- it is true that he spends much of the novel under the delusion of his love interest being what she really never was, but when he finally understands it, his anger at himself for not recognising it sooner and his strong desire to make amends for it was enough to make me immediately forgive him for his past mistakes.<br /><br />Many of the other characters also deserve some notice as well- Fanny's brother William is one of my very favorites in any Austen novel, and her horrible aunt Mrs. Norris is arguably one of her cruelest villains. Really, I can't think of any weak links- every character is deliniated in a strinking and lifelike way, and none seem to be one-dimensional, even when they are minor and not integral to the main story.<br /><br />In closing, I would point out that while a reader in the mood for something \\"light, bright and sparkling\\" might not really appreciate Mansfield Park as much, anyone in need of a good, solid and fascinating novel should not pass it up.
B000002H33|5.0|I recently got into Metallica the past few weeks (their old stuff anyway). Ride the Lightning was the first CD I got. After being blown away by it, I didn't possibly think it could get better. I had always heard that MOP was their greatest moment, so I was Excited to recieve it. I thought RTL was going to be my favorite, but wow I was wrong. This is now one of my favorite metal CDs ever. There isn't one dull moment on this CD.<br /><br />  Battery 10/10: This track starts out slow, but then the metal punches you in the stomach and your left breathless. Wow, one hell of an album opener (kind of similar to RTL's Fight Fire With Fire). This song deals with aggression.<br />  Master of Puppets 10/10: This is my personal favorite on the album. This song has the catchiest chorus and a slow, yet beautiful balled section in the middle. This song deals with drug addiction.<br />  The Thing That Should Not Be 8/10: A lot of people bash this song. It is the weakest song on the album, but compared on its own, it's a metal masterpiece.<br />  Welcome Home 9/10: This is the album's balled (still pretty heavy though). It deals with a mental patiant's struggle in an institution. The lyrics shine hear.<br />  Disposable Heroes 10/10: This song is very underrated. This is one of the highlights on the album, imo. It deals with soldiers' strain in battle. The lyrics are perfect, and the chorus is catchy and heavy.<br />  Leper Messiah 9/10: Another underrated song. Some say it's the weak point (but some like me disagree, I still say The Thing That Should Not Be is) on the album. It deals with priests collection contributions to earn a higher seat.<br />  Orion 10/10: Wow. This is probably Metallica's best instrumental. The Call of the Ktulu was great, but often repetetive. Not this one. This one is interesting the first half, and then changes style and continues to sound even more interesting as it goes along. I'm not sure what it's about, but can guess that it's about outer space.<br />  Damage Inc. 9.5/10: Great. Probably Metallica's best album closure. One hell of a closure. After the long and beautiful Orion, people are in a trance of a pretty melody in the first minute. But then the song takes off without expectancy and is over and done before you realize what just happened. The song is pretty much about what the title says.<br /><br />Overall, terrific album without any filler. I'll be getting AJFA later next week.Damage Inc. 9.5/10: Great.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|This has got to be the best album that I have heard all year.  I'm glad LP went a new direction and was not just doing the same tried and true formula for every album, that shows growth as an artist.  I think they did an awesome job, \\"Little Things Give You Away\\" is one of the best songs that I have heard in a very long time.
B000301YY8|1.0|The first time I ever heard of James Blunt was on the radio and they were playing his first big hit \\"You're Beautiful\\". I just thought to myself \\"Woah, who's this dude with that horrible singing voice?\\" One of my friends loves him and she lent me the CD because she had asked me if I've heard of James Blunt, and I told her no. When I popped the CD in my stereo. I realized this was the same guy from the radio. I listened to the whole thing, because I just thought that he might actually have some good songs, but I was wrong, all his songs were super boring, and his voice is just ear grating, it was like when you scratch a chalkboard.On a positive note he is not a bad songwriter, he just can't sing, so he would be better off at just writing songs.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Thank You for Smoking sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Tobacco giants and their associate companies have become, the health hazards associated with cigarette smoking, the power of the media, and the hypocrisy of so many who oppose tobacco.   The film brings to the screen the story of Nick Naylor, a spin-doctor, as he travels with his 12-year-old son across the country showing him what he does for a living.   Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duvall, J.K. Simmons, William Macy, Katie Holmes, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good and it does get the message across loud and clear.  In short, balanced and fair, Thank You for Smoking, is a movie definitely worth watching, as it is surely an eye opener.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore does a great job giving us facts, without boring the viewer with too many details.  The purpose of the DVD is to make us aware, then hopefully we can be more receptive to learning more about what we can do specifically, or more receptive to change.
B000063Y8F|5.0|This shiny, heavenly garlic press is everything it's cracked up to be--easy to use, wastes very little garlic, cleans up easily, and it's sturdy.<br /><br />Combined with the ZAK garlic peeler (a little plastic roll) to peel cloves almost instantly, I can peel and mince 5 large cloives in garlic in around 2 minutes. One minute to wash everything up (and this Rosle cleans very easily with a toothbrush), and game over--the garlic ining has come and gone, and it's a home run for garlic...<br /><br />I used to think my Cuisinart mini food processor was the living end for fast garlic mincing, but no more. Too much cleaning and the end product is not as uniform in mince as with this press.<br /><br />This press does work with unpeeled cloves, but the grate clogs faster and it's more of a pain-in the-arse! I really recommend the ZAK or similiar peeler--couldn't be easier.<br /><br />Yes, this press is pricey--but SOOOOOO worth it in this modest cook's opinion...
B000002LK1|5.0|What can I say? This is one of the best DM albums. I listen to this CD almost every single day. The music is just so dark, sexy, and seductive, and David Gahan's voice goes so well with the music. I just can't help, but to say over and over that I absolutely LOVE this album. I agree with another reviewer who said that \\"Policy of Truth\\" was the best DM song ever made, but along with that song my favorites include: The World in my Eyes, Sweetest Perfection, Halo, and who can forget the 2 biggest hits which were Personal Jesus & Enjoy the Silence. This CD is a winner. For the newer mode fans I definitely recommend getting this album, along with Black Celebration and Music for the Masses.
B00022M518|5.0|\\"Tyler B.\\" gets it so wrong it isn't funny.  The songs on HCTWJ are quirky, catchy, funny, inventive, and fresh, even after 30 years.<br /><br />There are more ideas on this album than in most bands' entire body of work.  The nice thing, though, is that you can ignore all the word games, genre-jumping, and clever studio tricks. and just rock out.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Eno's later work, know that his first two solo albums are far from ambient.<br /><br />Play loud.

096319254X|3.0|Not sure what to think about this book. It wasn't that bad, and Lestat was still Lestat, in a way (unlike Blood Canticle, which is horrible), but it didn't really feel like part of the vampire cronicles. I mean, she could have used any character. Like the book itself states, the main char doesn't need to be a vampire. Another thing that I did not like about this book was that it was too philosophical (with God and the devil and heaven and hell and all) to be very realistic for me. During the preceeding for books, I could believe in the existence of vampires and all, at least while reading. They made me suspend disbelief, and this book just didn't. I felt like there was a joke being played upon me. Also, while the other books 'changed' me in some ways and made me think, this book was jsut forgettable. I hardly remember most of what happened in it.

Each one is filled with rich, upbeat heart and soul, while delivering music that will stay with you, as it has stayed with me for many years.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|This was just awful.  I'll give it two stars for Tubbs and Trudy.  That's about it.  Farrell, who is very much overrated in my opinion, needed a shower and some motivation to do a decent job acting, while Gong Li, who is normally intense and stunning, just looked bored.  Problem is, I don't think it was their fault.  This was a horrid script.  It made no sense, there was no real chemistry between Farrell and Foxx or Farrell and Li (gee, is he the common denominator of badness for this film?).  This had to have been a paycheck film for everyone involved. Save your money, don't even rent this.
0312305060|5.0|I read this book in a few hours.  I could not put it down -- I felt like Laura Brown - needing to do what is my societal duty, but completely obsessed with Cunningham's book.    To fully appreciate this novel, a person should have read Woolf's novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" or at least have a knowledge of that particular book.    Cunningham weaves a seamless story.  It is actually refreshing to have one chapter melt into another chapter of another woman in a different era....yet all are bound by duty versus their own desires.    No wonder this unique and beautifully written novel won the Pulitzer Prize.    I do not feel it is a book just for women, nor is it an \\"estrogen fest\\" as some narrow minded misogynists have deemed the novel.    Read the novel for what it is and don't permit gender to get in the way of a well written, lavish, and extraordinary book.    Just because the book is primarily about females and deals with homosexuality, suicide, and depression does not mean it is not great literature.
0316018953|2.0|Here's what makes Overlook jump the shark: Connelly shoehorns the story into a political message. I suppose he knows which side his bread is buttered on, and since the tab was being picked up by the New York Times he had to give them a Harry Bosch mystery that fit with their agenda.<br /><br />I can't get into it much more without giving away plot points, so let me just say Michael Moore, the folks at CAIR, and the tinfoil-hat brigade of \\"Truthers\\" will no doubt love this latest and least of Connelly's Bosch series.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Many reviewers have lamented the mellowing of Wilco on their latest release, Sky Blue Sky, at least in relation to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and a Ghost Is Born. I submit to you that Wilco has not so much softened their sound as matured in their approach; this is an entirely positive development.    Sky Blue Sky is Wilco's most cohesive album, both in song-to-song quality and production. The studio trickery that has been Wilco's crutch since Summerteeth is all-but-absent here, replaced with a warm, live sound last captured on a few of the songs on Being There. Here, Tweedy's tunes are finally given a chance to succeed or fail on their own terms, and overwhelmingly, they triumph. \\"Either Way\\", \\"Sky Blue Sky\\", and \\"What Light\\" are three of Tweedy's finest works, and they are performed by a sympathetic band that knows when to lay back and when to explode. Nels Cline's playing suits the songs beautifully--his ghostly steel guitar and fiery leads providing compliments and counterpoints to Tweedy's fine lyrics and melodies.    On Sky Blue Sky, Tweedy's best songs are performed by Wilco's finest lineup, and it's all captured on their cleanest, warmest, simplest recording to date. This is a moving record, a grower, and possibly the best Wilco has to offer. I'm not sure they can top this.    If, for whatever reason, you haven't given this record a fair chance, you're cheating yourself. Sky Blue Sky is the sound of confident a band at their musical peak. Don't pass it by.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Every song on Lost Highway is a number one single. Bon Jovi has done it again. This time with a perfection as fine as a fine wine.

B000G6BJS0|3.0|I am being a little stingy not granting Jansons' complete Shostakovich cycle four stars, but I can't escape feeling disappointed. Over the long years and many orchestras that have come to pass since the project started, Jansons' cycle promised to be a successor to Haitink's acclaimed one on Decca with the Concertgebouw and London Phil. of the Eighties. Yet nothing has much improved. I know both cycles fairly well, and Jansons hits no home runs. Despite his musical pedigree -- both Mariss and his father Arvid were associated with Mravinsky and the Leningrad Phil.--Jansons tends to be more cautious and even faceless compared to Haitink, who is no firebrand.<br /><br />I can't argue with admirers who point to the fine execution and excellent balances, the discipline and the good engineering here. But Shostakovich needs fire and inspiration to overcome his weaknesses, which can be severe. The music often sprawls, relies on banal themes, dips into depressive melancholy, or at the other extreme indulges in insincere jollity that seems politically motivated. Whatever your position on these issues, Shostakovich is an enigma looking for someone to unlock it.  As steady and purposeful as these readings are, I don't think Jansons holds that key.<br /><br />If I were collecting the fifteen symphonies individually, which is still the best way, I'd go for the relatively unknown ones from Jansons, such as #2, #3, and #4, which bring out the best in him. He doesn't excel at the famous Fifth and is middle-of-the-road in the Sixth and Seventh (his live Seventh with the Concertgebouw is another story--I would place it among the very best).  At a high standard but not keeping up with the legendary Mravinsky are Jansons'  Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth.  I don't much care what happens in the windy Eleventh and Twelfth, but the final trio, #13-15, greatly interest me. In these works I found Jansons steady and reliable but not riveting or inspired.<br /><br />On the whole, then, this is a consistent cycle that generally keeps up with Haitink's without cresting over it.stent cycle that generally keeps up with Haitink's without cresting over it.
B00004R997|3.0|This movie was one of two movies made at the request of the Office of Inter-American Affairs during World War II.  The goal of the trip that created this movie was to help improve relations with South America during the war.  Some countries in South America had little reason to be friendly with the United States during the war, and some of these countries had relatively friendly relations with the Axis powers.  Walt Disney's goodwill trip was a relatively low-key way for the United States to show South Americans how friendly the Unites States was.<br /><br />There are three problems with this \\"full-length\\" animated feature.  First, the animation is actually four cartoons that Disney wove into the visit by Walt Disney and a team of artists to South America.  The second problem is that this feature is only 42 minutes long, which is well short of feature length.  The 75 minutes shown on the box includes a documentary titled \\"South of the Border with Disney.\\"  The third problem with this \\"full-length\\" animated feature is that it is very dated.  South America has changed a lot in the six-plus decades since this movie was initially released.  The result of these problems is that the movie falls well short of being a \\"must-have,\\" unless you are a die-hard Disney fan and you must have everything created by Disney.<br /><br />This DVD does have two redeeming features.<br /><br />First, the four cartoons woven into this feature are cute and clever.  \\"Lake Titicaca\\" shows Donald Duck in various locations in South America.  Donald shows some interesting and exciting aspects of riding a llama on suspension bridges, among other things.  This short is funny, clever and worth watching multiple times.  \\"El Gaucho Goofy\\" has Goofy showing the similarity between American cowboys and South American gauchos.  The demonstration is hilarious.  \\"Pedro\\" is similar to \\"The Little Engine That Could,\\" only Pedro is a small mail plane rather than a train.  This short is quite clever and is one of the best reasons to have this DVD.  The fourth short is \\"Aquarela do Brasil,\\" or \\"Watercolor of Brazil.\\"  Donald Duck and Jos&eacute; Carioca experience the wonders of 1942 Brazil in colorful and clever ways.<br /><br />Second, the film shows Disney and a team of artists in action as they gather information and sketch scenes.

0743454537|5.0|This book, My Sister's Keeper, began as a simple summer reading book. I opened the book expecting it to either be tiresome, difficult to understand, or one to put down ASAP. Needless to say, it wasn't any of those. My Sister's Keeper turned into my favorite book instantly, and was very difficult to put down!    This novel is about a family, the Fitzgeralds, who are dealing with a few problems. Brian, the father, is a firefighter. Sara, the mother, is holding on to all hopes as they seem to turn. Jesse, the oldest son, was given up on, and has turned into a.. bad kid. Kate, the middle child and oldest daughter, was diagnosed with ACL, leukemia at the age of two, and has been battling it for 14 years now. Finally, Anna, the youngest daughter and child, was designed by genetic specialists to be perfect for helping Kate to survive. Anna is now 13, and questioning all things in life, even if it means losing her beloved sister.    This novel has taken me to almost all the emotions within me. It has been beautifully crafted to fit different characters, and show from their point of view. I highly reccomend it to all.
0064471837|5.0|My friend gave this book to me for my birthday several years ago and I never got around to reading it until a few weeks ago during vacation. I read through it in only three days (and I was on vacation, so it wasn't just like I was sitting around reading it all day). It really is a fantastic book.<br />Filled with action, adventure, and fantasy (with a bit of reality too), Sabriel is a great read for anyone. And the book is pretty fast-moving too, so I had trouble putting it down!<br />I tried reading Lirael, but it lacked the constant fast pace of Sabriel. I'm going to try and read it again, but Sabriel is my favorite so far (but I haven't gotten around to the third book, Abhorsen). Sabriel has a lot of action and is very comical in some parts. Definitely a book that should not be passed by!
B000001PE2|5.0|I can't believe this is a 'live' recording.  I can't believe how great this is.  I can't believe how great of a trio this was!  If you are a fan of great music, no matter what the genre, and you have semi-decent taste in music, then purchase this one immediately.  While you are at it, you might as well purchase \\"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\\", the other classic recording by the trio from the same session in June of 1961.  Both of these recordings are essential to not just a jazz fan's collection, but any collector of great music.<br /><br />It is such a shame that LaFaro died tragically ten days after this memorable performance.  You don't often hear his name mentioned when you hear people discussing the greatest bass players of all-time.  However, after listening to these two albums, there is no denying that his performance was just as great as any other performance by the legendary jazz bassists (i.e. Ray Brown, Jaco, Chambers, Mingus, et al...).  It's simply beyond definition!  And yes, I am referring to a bass player folks.  Only heaven knows how great his career could have been had his life not ended so abruptly.<br /><br />The splendid, swan-song performance by LaFaro, does in no way overshadow the fine work by Bill Evans himself and drummer Paul Motian.  Motian compliments his two pals perfectly with his silky, serene brush strokes and his laid back, unassuming style.  While Bill Evans is just, well... Bill Evans.  The man was simply a genius.  I can listen to him play all night long.  This is perfect music to listen and lounge to, or be in a lounge and listen to (of course sipping on some cocktails while you're at it).  It is also great music to read to and one of my favorites to play right before I go to sleep at night.  It always fills my heart and mind full of harmony and peace.<br /><br />Six Stars If I Could!
B000N4SHOE|4.0|The movie is very entertaining. Zellweger is good as Ms. Potter. The scenes of how she falls in love with Ewan McGregor's character are good. How both Miss Potter and publisher spent enormous amount of time getting the colors just right was interesting. I thought the animations were hit and miss. However, overall the animations do demonstrate how her characters were fully integrated into her life.     I can't think of any real negatives. It is a very good period piece. Her paintings were amazing.The English landscapes were breathtaking.  Friends of mine are going to start living in England this fall. I definitely want to go visit. The movie was charming in every sense of the word.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I had recorded the U.S. version from Discovery Channel HD on a Comcast DVR. The picture quality is great, but the blu-ray version is jaw-dropping spectacular.  This has to be as close as you can get to 3D television without actually having 3D TV. You get the sensation of being able to reach out to the screen and touch plants, animals, etc.  Lastly, my wife and I both prefer the Attenborough narration to the Weaver narration.
006085880X|5.0|I first read one of Jodi Picoult's novels last year [Plain Truth], and have since bought all of her books! She is an amazing writer, and in each of her novels, the stories are so real and make you empathise with the characters portrayed. In The Pact, we are introduced to the Golds and the Hartes, longtime friends and neighbors, whose children, Chris and Emily naturally gravitate towards each other and become a couple. This idyllic life comes to an abrupt end when Emily dies at 17 from a gunshot wound...and Chris' description of a suicide pact gone awry raises suspicion, anger and doubts. The novel is well-plotted and the complexities of human relationships are explored in great detail. This novel makes for a gut wrenching read that will have you questioning the bonds of family, friendship and love.
0316018953|3.0|The Overlook, as most reviewers have pointed out, is leaner than a typical Michael Connelly novel, and as such, there are fewer curves in the road for Harry Bosch to navigate.  The entire novel plays out in just over 12 hours and not a page is wasted.  This is not Michael Connelly's most substantive work, but it is a fast paced, entertaining page turner.<br /><br />The twists and turns at the end of the novel are apt to make you roll your eyes a little.  The killer(s) (I don't want to give anything away here) make a mistake that is a little hard to believe and Harry solves the crime with some pretty flimsy evidence but it's nothing that can't be forgiven.<br /><br />This is a well written, fast paced thriller.  Harry Bosch manages to `do a Jack Bauer' in half as much time.  I recommend the novel; as long as you aren't expecting The Concrete Blonde.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite \\"Desert Island Discs.\\" The songwriting and performances are superb.  Joni Mitchell captures the range of human emotions in these lyrically resonant, melodically beautiful songs.  Just thinking about this album is enough to elicit a strong reaction in me, and listening to it is akin to drinking a shot of very fine whiskey -- metaphorically speaking of course.
0060555661|4.0|This is the 4th edition of Benjamin Graham's landmark book for the investing public, called \\"The Intelligent Investor.\\"  However, it's been \\"updated\\" for 2003 by Jason Zweig, a senior editor and writer at CNN/Money, and overall I think this detracts from, rather than improves, the book.  I rate Graham's book 5 stars and Zweig's contributions get 3 stars: overall, 4 stars.    First off, there are 3 contributors to this book: Buffett, Graham and Zweig.  Warren Buffett, the superinvestor who heads Berkshire Hathaway, is frequently pointed out as one of the world's great investors/stock pickers and also as Ben Graham's star student.  Buffett's preface to this book consists of 2 pages: a biographical essay he wrote about Graham in 1976, saying nice things about Graham's personal qualities; and a recommendation to pay particular attention to Chapters 8 and 20.  (Buffett, incidentally, cannot be honestly said to have been influenced by this book; his bible was Graham's landmark 1940 textbook for the professional security analyst, called \\"Security Analysis.\\")  So Buffettologists should know that there will be little to interest them here.    Graham's text is level-headed and sane, and makes for wonderful reading.  His distinction between speculators and investors, his way of viewing the markets, and his methodical approach to considering the inherent value of investments is required reading.  In my opinion, any non-professional who's interested in investing money could benefit from reading it.  Enough said about that.    However, Graham's book makes up only about 1/3 of the present volume.  The format is the following:  Graham writes a 6 page chapter; Zweig pads that chapter out to 8 pages with giant footnotes; and then Zweig appends a 10-15 page \\"commentary\\" to each chapter.   Now who exactly is Jason Zweig?  I'd never heard of him.  His qualifications are very different from Graham's and Buffett's; he is a writer for CNN/Money magazine.  I don't consider him to be an investment professional.    Unfortunately, this shows in his writing.  Whereas Graham's text is even-handed, methodical, and rational, Zweig comes across as hysterical, emotional, and shrill.  His annoying habit of flinging superlatives around (he frequently mentions Buffett as \\"the greatest investor of all time\\", and calls Graham the \\"greatest practical investment thinker of all time\\") is annoying and adds little to understanding.  But much worse is his incessant habit of putting words into Graham's mouth.  About 3 or 4 chapters in I began to chafe at this.  \\"Who is this Jason Zweig exactly,\\" I thought, \\"and how exactly does he claim to know how Graham would have analyzed the tech bubble of 1999-2000?\\"    As I started paying closer attention, I began to feel that Zweig was making comments - under the guise of \\"updating\\" Graham's ideas - that Graham himself would never have endorsed.  This bothered me.  I feel that, in a way, I was baited with Graham's name into buying a book by Jason Zweig, and it's not the book I thought I was buying.    To be fair, Zweig's commentary is often interesting.  His commentary on Chapter 12 has nothing to do with Graham's chapter (on analyzing per-share earnings) at all; rather, it is a scathing, well-presented, easily understood, and fairly detailed analysis of certain examples of accounting irregularities that contributed to the tech blowup and led to Sarbanes-Oxley.  (I wouldn't be surprised to learn Zweig had written a book of his own about this topic; if so, I may buy it.)  But this only further strengthens the feeling, present always, that Zweig is less interested in explaining Graham's text and more interested in pushing his own agenda and ways of investment thinking.  Now for the casual reader who enjoys CNN/Money's style and format as their principal source of investment advice, they may truly enjoy and benefit from this.  But I wanted to read Graham's historical text as a whole and interpret it myself; Zweig's constant, harping interpolations severely detracted from my ability to do this.    Finally, there is little in the first 10 chapters of this book that has not become near-dogma for the conservative, value-oriented small investor, repeated ad nauseam in the pages of Money, Forbes, the Motley Fool, and elsewhere.  The meat of the book is in the last half, where Graham touches - lightly - on issues that the conservative investor may be interested in valuing, and how to do it right.  Frankly I was expecting him to go into more depth on these topics, and I will probably be picking up a copy of either The Interpretation of Financial Statements or Security Analysis (the 1940 edition seems to be the consensus pick) to learn more about his thoughts on these matters.
B00000F1D3|5.0|It is not a mystery why this disc was as successful as it became.  Nine years after its initial release, the songs sound as fresh and enticing as they did when I first listened to it.  The program is full of pulsating dance numbers: \\"Believe,\\" \\"Strong Enough,\\" \\"All Or Nothing.\\"  Cher reworks one of her moderate hits from the late 1980s, \\"We All Sleep Alone,\\" into a beat-driven disco song.  And \\"Dov'e L'Amore\\" is a song reminiscent of her Snuff Garrett days, appropriately modernized.    Cher's continuing ability to realign herself in center stage after a period of relative dormancy proved undiminished when \\"Believe\\" hit the airwaves.  More importantly, it made people more aware of Cher's musical standing: She outlasted 99% of her contemporaries from the early '60s and her ability to entertain only grew as time passed.  More than ever, we need to be reminded that its okay to have fun and there's no better person to remind us of that than Cher.
B000I9VZJ8|1.0|This movie was absolute torture! There is no plot. The characters need to be killed and put out of their misery. We only suffered through 45 minutes before we turned it off. Don't waste your money.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Excellent option if you want to have all ten seasons at the same time, and at a very cheap price. It was delivered in ten days here to Mexico. And yes, it does have spanish subtitles.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Thankfully, they didn't decide to name this movie Rocky VI, so we can forget that the fifth one ever happened.  This unexpectedly good followup (but hopefully finale) to the Rocky saga is a real treat.      In the first two Rocky movies we had the real story.  A rags to riches fighter dealing with family and money and fame.  Sure it's simple and plays like a soap opera, but it's the simplicity of it all that's great.  The fighting was about dignity and pride.      Rocky three, while perhaps the most fun of the franchise, can't be taken as seriously.  Pitting Hulk Hogan and Mr T. against Rocky was entertaining, but pretty much just fluff.  And Rocky IV was way too cheesy for me.      With Rocky Balboa, you can forget all the pro wrestlers and the Russian steroid driven He-Men.  The soul is back.  Here we have Rocky dealing with his dead wife, his relationship with his son and making corny but heartful motivational speeches to his loved ones around him.  Surprisingly, it all works really well.  Even before the actual fight takes place, or is even proposed, it's hard not to be sucked up into Rocky's story of hardship in Philidelphia.      The fight that takes place is between the old retired champ and a cocky young fighter, Dixon, who wants to use the match to gain popularity.  Dixon encourages Rocky to keep the fight simple so he can lose with dignity, but of course Rocky has none of it.  Here he is out to shed the demons of his past and prove to himself one last time that it was all worthwhile.    Overall, this movie was really good; a great last harrah for the frachnise.  Did this movie need to be made?  Probably not, but with a bitter taste left in our mouths from V, it's good to have a real finale to this saga.  The fight itself was good, but a little by the numbers and not as gritty or edge of your seat as we've seen from previous outtings, which really is the only reason for the missing star.  But I recommend this to fans of the franchise and welcome it in my collection.
B000S0DDG0|5.0|Absolutely one of the most enjoyable 'musicals' I've ever seen.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson's acting and singing makes her a young lady to watch.  What a voice!  She blended with Beyonce' and the other stars and never looked back.<br /><br />The movie is a very moving story, with a little information about payola and how moguls can destroy a career 'just because,' but talent will win in the long run.  Success can be a very difficult road when blocks are put in your way, as they were for her character.<br /><br />The movie is uplifting and hopeful. The music is heavenly; I plan to order the CD as well. The extras on the DVD offer good information; one of the things I've learned from watching deleted scenes is that a good editor makes or breaks the movie.<br /><br />5 stars; a movie to watch over and over.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|The story, acting, cinematography, music and recreation of Victorian era English manor life in 1838 combine to make Firelight an exquisite film.  At its heart, Firelight is a love story, in fact, many love stories, but screenwriter and director William Nicholson (Gladiator) also manages to convey how limited the opportunities were for women of the Time.  Even well educated woman had few opportunities rather than marry and become the property of their husbands.  Fans of the the Romance genre, and Period pieces in general, will not be disappointed.  Firelight didn't get the attention it deserved when it was released in 1998.  If you are a Romance or Period piece enthusiast, or just enjoy a well told love story, do yourself a huge favor and purchase or rent the DVD.  The 2004 release is in English and All Region DVD compatible (playable on any DVD player).
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I am a huge country music fan and I listen to every type of music there is out there.  All I can say about this cd is wow!  I can't recommend this cd enough.  Brad Paisley is amazing, not just his voice and guitar abilities but the song writing on this album is pure genius.  \\"It did\\" actually brought tears to my eyes and that is not something that happens to me!!
B000QQH4YS|2.0|This is a good movie. But I wouldn't waste my money. MGM has this Unrated version in the ROBOCOP Trilogy that was released in 2004. I advise to pick that up if you can still find it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001VTPWM Robocop Trilogy]]
0312360266|5.0|I read this novel in one sitting. I'm completely enamored with the world created by P.C. and Kristin Cast and I adore powerful, but confused Zoey. As a bonus, I live in Tulsa and it was great fun to see familiar settings rewritten (Cascia Hall as the House of Night? Woot!). I can't wait for BETRAYED. Write faster, ladies! I'm hooked!
B00000I41J|5.0|This cd is packed with a roster of musicians that paved the way for the young lions of today.  This is a cd that is full of jam sessions.
0743454537|5.0|I went to a book signing for Ms. Picoult for Nineteen Minutes.  The conversation topic quickly turned to this book and stayed there for awhile.  I was curious about why a majority of the attendees were angry with how she ended the book.  I decided I needed to read My Sister's Keeper prior to Nineteen Minutes.    I thought this book was very well written.  I loved that Ms. Picoult told the story in each character's perspective.  She gave good insight about a family in turmoil and the decisions parents must make to keep their child alive.  The book is not a black and white issue.    I absolutely adored Anna and thought she really made the book for me.  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending.  It did blow me away, but quite honestly, I'm not sure how it could have ended a different way.  I highly recommend this book!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I was glad to hear elements of \\"Rust In Peace\\" in the song writing, but this Megadeth will never be that Megadeth. I can't tell you which \\"post Dave's accident\\" Megadeth is better: The System has Failed Megadeth or this version; both are pretty solid. But you can be assured that this album will crush whatever ME-tallica puts out later this year.<br /><br />I still miss Marty, Nick, and Jr.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This movie makes you think. This movie is kinda biased and a lot of clips were taken way out of context. For example, the clip where Britney Spears says \\" we should all support our president Bush\\" was take out of context much  like the American soldiers in Iraq acting psychotic and making them seem like they lost it and were killing everyone randomly. But yes, the Bush administration and politicians and the goverenment in general are all corrupt and evildoers. This is how the American society is. The rich justs keeps getting richer and the middle and lower class are becoming poorer. And everything in our society is in favor of the rich. For example, Paris Hilton.  If the Paris Hilton incident happened to someone else that person would've been behind bars for 5 to 10 years. But poor Paris was whining and crying and said \\"this isn't right\\" by serving only 20 something days. Our US laws and our government are a big joke.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Everyone wants to talk about a return to form; back to the days of \\"Burn my Eyes\\". I think they re molded that form into something completely different. The energy on this album is insane.<br /><br />Best album since since Heaven Shall Burn's \\"Antigone\\" - for me at least.
B0000033RY|5.0|I'm 53, and a classic rocker from the late 60's into the 70's. If you liked Vanella Fudge, then you know about Carmine Appice, and Tim Bogert...on the Fender Bass. And if you ever bought In The Beginning, their live album, then you know what great talents these guys are. It only stands to reason that they would be a great combo when I saw they were on a Cactus album I bought, One Way Or Another. Wow!!! These guys put Mitch Ryder type groups to shame!!! I only wish I could have seen these guys in concert. 'Ot and Sweaty is the next best thing. When I saw Cactology ( what a great name for an anthology album ) on CD, I immediately bought it. What a great set of songs to really get to know about the essence of Cactus. If you like your music gritty and grimey, then Cactus is for you. By the way, garage bands could learn a lot by listening to this group!  JM from OKC, OK
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't believe I just found this incredible movie. It is a work of art from the music to the cinematography to the acting. Richard Armitage's performance is a gift. I loved every minute of it.
B00005JLK1|2.0|This movie takes some well worn ideas and puts them to sea, along with some 21st century gore and really bad soundtrack. Really too bad, because they still could have turned the material into a great story. Instead we get a couple of shocks, a montage of grisly deaths, and a \\"surprise ending\\" that's anything but.     Still, not a completely abysmal entry in this category. Julianna Margulies is acceptable as a Sigourney Weaver (a la Alien) type who knows how to deal with the situation at hand. There's certainly worse out there.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|I seriously hope we get out of this comic book phase soon. It seems like for every top director that brings us a Batman Begins or X2: X-Men United, we get hacks and wannabes who think they can do just as well. After previously releasing (or is that staining the legacy of?) Daredevil, Mark Steven Johnson brings Ghost Rider to your TV set and like that other film, it's something you watch and all the while thinking of what director would've made this movie awesome.     Johnny Blaze was a young kid in a father/son motorcycle duo working in a circus. Dad stricken by cancer, Johnny strikes a deal with the Devil himself, Mephistopheles, to cure him in exchange for Johnny's soul. But of course that doesn't mean Dad will be around long and Johnny grows up and becomes Ghost Rider, a flaming skeleton on a souped-up bike dishing out punishment to any evil. The Devil's son, Blackheart, is after an ancient contract which will give him lots of souls to overthrow his father and its up to Johnny to take him down so he can get his life back. Add in the complication of Roxanne, Johnny's old flame, and Johnny will have to save the day from evil.    Sounds cheesy to read isn't it? Imagine watching it. Sure there's dumb dialogue right? They exist; just watch any recent Star Wars movie. But what makes Ghost Rider a pain to listen to is just how familiar it seems. You can practically make a checklist of all the cliche dialogue. And then there's the acting and at least we have Nicolas Cage who is either hamming it up for fun or he's trying his hardest but it comes across as being too cartoonish, even in a comic book movie. Eva Mendes is hot and I'm sure she can deliver good performances but this just smacks of bad acting direction, same goes for Wes Bentley. At least Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot bring some class and at least some chops into this thing.    One thing I will say though: the effects have gotten better over the years. Remember that one shot where Wolverine spins around that pieceof the Statue of Liberty but you can obviously tell the CG figure is way too fake? None of that here. While the facial additives look iffy, everything else from Ghost Rider himself to his riding and Blackheart's minions looks quite spot-on. As for the story itself, it's kind of hollow. One side character unexpectedly gets the axe and it's meant to be this big emotional denouement for them yet it just doesn't have the impact. Not to mention it's kind of...boring. No suspense or tension that's being built up and even in the extended cut, it just feels like adding or taking away, it's just a badly executed movie.    My cousin is a comic book fan from X-Men to Spider-Man and Batman and even he was disappointed in this. Normally he finds at least something of merit in these movies (for example, he finds the equally-inept Elektra movie tolerable because \\"Jennifer Garner's hot\\"). Some big comic book fans will like it, others will be like \\"ugh, of all the Ghost Rider movies to be made, THIS one goes through\\".
0385340559|5.0|Lee Child has a year cycle between the release of his `Jack Reacher' novels and Bad Luck and Trouble , was well worth the wait.  This offering was read until it is finished good - filled with nostalgia, action and adventure.<br /><br />Frances Neagley is back with her second appearance in the Reacher series and is interesting enough to have her own series.  Other members from the Special Investigators Unit that Reacher commanded are introduced and have key roles to play.  Ultimately, Jack becomes the commander he must have been years before and leads the team to a successful conclusion of their mission.  The plot is once again fit for a flawed hero and we see Jack as both human and heroic and we see all of the former Army members struggling to fit into civilian life, some more successfully than others.<br /><br />My one concern with Reacher's current path is his future development - how long can he be the ultimate fit ex-soldier traveling around the country and living by his wits.  I was hoping that we might see a potential for Reacher to further interact with his team in later books, maybe they would be a connection for Reacher that has been lacking in his life.  Right now Reacher is without roots, without family, and friends.  His former colleagues, while they have his affection and respect, and really out of sight, out of mind.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and will re-read it before the next book is released - Lee Child offers action, adventure, and a compelling character in Jack Reacher.  I'm anxiously awaiting his next offering and remain a loyal Reacher fan.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|well, unsurprisingly, some of the best shows are not returning next season.  we expected gilmore girls to go, it has about run its course.  but, veronica mars has been cut down in her prime, sadly.  admittedly, the third season was not as excellent as the first two, but it was still a smartly written, provocative show.  some of the urgency was gone, due to the fact that there was no season long mystery as in the previous seasons.  that being said, it was still probably the best show that aired last year.  i think the closer, with kyra sedgewick, ranks a close second.  i was quite irritated that there was no closure in the end of season 3. we (the fans) at least deserve a veronica mars movie that will give us some closure as far as veronica's and keith's future.  or maybe a book to finish up the story (are you listening rob thomas?).
B00005JKJA|5.0|I could watch this DVD 199 times (in a row!) and still not have the puzzle figured out.  Is the whole thing a dream?  All but a few minutes?  Only the first two-thirds?  None?  And what's up with the senior couple?  Or the cowboy?  And whatever it is that lives behind the diner?  And Lee Grant's Louise Bonner:  she's the only character that really knows what's going on, right?<br /><br />I would've flashed up \\"spoiler alert\\" -- but this movie is unspoilable.  This is David Lynch's masterpiece.  I liked \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  I liked the first season of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" but kinda lost interest when it focused too much on the Log Lady in Season Two.  But I lost interest in Lynch after the terrible \\"Wild At Heart.\\"  Nothing David Lynch has done before can prepare you for this.  This is the cinematic equivalent of Bob Beamon's 29ft 2.5in high jump in 1968:  nothing David Lynch has ever done will prepare you for something this extraordinary.<br /><br />What is it about?  L.A.  A city of juxtapositions.  The glitzy and the tawdry.  Success and failure.  Reality and delusion.  The blonde and the brunette.  Innocence and hot girl-on-girl action.  Betty Elms and Diana Selwyn.  What's it really about?  Who knows!  I don't think even David Lynch really knows.  This is an incredible work of art (not all movies are \\"art\\") that will leave you wondering about what you just saw for weeks, months, years, after the fact.
B000003D5F|5.0|The bass is usually not a lead instrument, usually it is in the back with the dishawashers. But here, you will find this is exactly why this performance is simply astounding. It is one of the best jazz performances I own, and it for someone new to Jazz this would be a great way to get a flavor for Jazz as an art. Ray Brown is king no doubt, John Clayton is a force to be reckoned as Ray's protege.<br /><br />This is a must have, for beginner to jazz expert.
B00005RYKU|4.0|Being a fan of both Leelee Sobieski and Diane Lane; I figured I had to see ths movie.  that and I do enjoy the predictable B-movie from time to time!    That being said, that is exactly what this movie is, a predictable (but funny) B-movie.  In all honesty, the script isn't half bad, and the acting is one thing that svaes this movie as a whole.  the one draw back is the fact that it is so predictable.  As someone has mentioned it seems to be more like a made-for-tv movie instead of a big-budget suspenseful thriller.    The acting as I mentioned is one thing that isn't half bad in this movie.  Diane Lane as always puts on her best performance even with a lackluster script.  Leelee Sobieski, who seems to always come under fire from both fans and critics alike, also puts on a super performance and shows she can hold her own alongside an actress like Diane Lane.    So yes, while the movie is predictable, and it has scenes that even may be highly unbelievable; it is a good movie to just sit and enjoy.  You can even get involved yourself; yelling at the screen and asking why certain charcters are dumb enough to do certain things!    I do recommend this movie for a good time, and when it comes to Leelee Sobieski you can't go wrong.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|There is tremendous pressure placed on a filmmaker after he delivers an Oscar winning picture early in his career, and ever since Training Day received its award for best acting all eyes have been on Antoine Fuqua to do it again. Trying to rekindle the \\"Academy\\" caliber magic, the filmmaker has attempted two epically scaled war films to little success. Even with an Oscar to your picture's credit, in Hollywood, three strikes can usually mean you're out. Luckily for Fuqua, the director had one last trick up his sleeve that will hit audiences from a mile away.<br /><br />While the trailer made the film appear as if it was a less entertaining version of In the Line of Fire, Fuqua's new film, Shooter, is a surprisingly fresh take on a hard-R action film. Starring Mark Whalberg, Shooter boldly exhibits a true anti-hero vigilante that is not afraid to dole out justice even if it means sacrificing customary role-model morals.<br /><br />Framed by a powerful, unnamed rogue corporation for an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, ex-marine and expert sniper Bob Lee Swagger not only has to outrun federal agents in order to prove his innocence, but the world's best \\"shooter\\" must extract revenge in places where the law is incapable of going.<br /><br />Fuqua, a director who has a history of working with strong male leads, certainly picked perhaps the hottest up and coming male property Hollywood has to offer these days to fill in this role of a modern day Rambo. Coming off his Academy Award nominated performance in The Departed, Mark Whalberg certainly carries the mantle of a John Wayne-like cowboy, dealing justice from the end of a smoking barrel, quite well.<br /><br />Though the marketing campaign makes the picture appear to be a political thriller, at its heart Shooter is a revenge film that works on a simple premise: for every injustice vengeance must be taken. Granted there are some points where the film gets bogged down with over-the-top government conspiracy mumbo jumbo, these holdovers from the novel upon which Shooter was based can easily be forgiven thanks to a simple remedy provided by Fuqua: he knows how to blow stuff up.<br /><br />Offering refreshing action based on exhilarating practical effects, Shooter fires up impressive blood sprays, napalm explosions, crashing helicopters and great hand to hand combat sure to satiate the appetite of action lovers. At some point during the narrative the film tries to justify Whalberg's raw justice by insinuating that the film's villains, headed by Warren Beatty and Danny Glover, were involved in the destruction and killing of an entire African village for monetary gain. However, Shooter so clearly draws a line between the good and the bad that this subplot is moot; we already want to see Bob Lee Swagger exact his revenge, and each kill along his quest is even more satisfying than the last.<br /><br />Predictably audiences will know where Shooter will ultimately go, but that is the nature of the genre. The simple storytelling and intensity of the picture's action should be enough for this substantially memorable spring blockbuster to captivate audiences. Though it may not be Oscar material, Fuqua has proved that not only does he have big budget hits left in him, but that Shooter is an unadulterated shot to the head.<br /><br />-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.netoldovers from the novel upon which Shooter was based can easily be forgiven thanks to a simple remedy provided by Fuqua: he knows how to blow stuff up.

B000NDEXOI|4.0|When it comes to Greatest Hits albums, there are many that seem to fall short of capturing the essence of the band and what it is they accomplished.  In the case of \\"40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row,\\" while it too is not perfect, it comes very close.    1. Youth Gone Wild -  This is how to begin an album!  Heavy guitars, powerful vocals, and a message that being a youth is all in your heart and you CAN stay young forever!  A true rocking anthem that will have you banging your head with madness! 5/5    2. 18 and Life -  many people may know this song very well.  One of the bands biggest and best hits.  A great song with a great, dark and sad story.  Seems to be a bit of Ricky inside us all! 4/5    3. Piece of Me -  Right back into the heavy rocking non-stop action that we know Skid Row for.  I wasn't a big fan of this song  at first but it does grow on you.  Great song when performed live as well. 4/5    4. I Remember You -  This is usually the song that everyone knows and associates Skid Row with.  The ballad of the album, the band, and perhaps even the ballad of the decade!  The vocals are strong yet peaceful, and the guitar work is perfectly matched with the harmony of the tune as well. 4.5/5    5. The Threat -  This song I find to be very much like \\"Piece of Me.\\"  Again this is a song that didn't grab me right away but has grown on me with time.  Hard and heavy hitting off the heels of the ballad. 4/5    6. Psycho Love -  Again, might take a couple of listens to really enjoy, but this definetly is a pretty rocking song!  Powerful vocals and awesome guitar work by the man Rachael Bolan!  In the linear notes the band states they are still waiting for a movie to be made from this song!  Pretty cool idea! 4/5    7. Monkey Business -  One of my favorite tracks on the album!  Starts slow and soft, then picks up very hard and heavy when you least expect it.  Very powerful and strong vocals here!  Saw it performed live at a concert, and live on SNL before and each time it rocked the house.  So much energy here its undeniable. 5/5    8. Quicksand Jesus -  I would catergorize this song as a semi-ballad.  Stars slow and soft, picks up to slightly heavy, then fluctuates between the two.  Awesome song that shows the raw emotion the band members were feeling at the time.  Good message with a good hook. 5/5    9. Slave To The Grind -  The hit single that many remember Skid Row for; besides \\"I Remeber You.\\"  The song itself has the basic hook, basic guitar playing, and even basic vocals.  One thing though, it has an undeniable message much like \\"Youth Gone Wild.\\"  Overall, this song deserved to be the hit it was. 4.5/5    10. Into Another {Remix} -  A pretty cool version of this song.  Again on the semi-soft side, but it shows that the band does have emotions.  Excellent harmonizing in the song as well with stand-out drum work. 4/5    11. Frozen (Demo 1994) -  In my opinion, the weakest song on the album.  That of course isn't saying much as it was a demo version.  Had potential, but seemed a bit cluttered and out of place on this album. 3/5    12. My Enemy {Remix} -  After a few listens, this song is pretty rocking.  Not to heavy, but definetly not soft.  Excellent guitar work, and Sebastian doesn't over-do the vocals at all. 4/5    13. Breakin' Down {Remix} -  In my opinion this is the lost gem, not only on this album, but compared to thier other ballad, this one stands well on its own!  Yes, its a ballad, but an awesome one at that.  Again, one can hear the true emotions going into the song and that makes it all the more real.  Do not under-estimate this song! 5/5    14. Beat Yourself Blind [Live] -  This song picks the tempo right back up!  A classic raw, live performance that truly shows the energy that the entire band has.  It doesn't however do any justice in showing just how insane Sebastian Bach is on stage!  Awesome rock anthem!  5/5    15. Forever {1988 Previously UnReleased} -  This is another song that shouldn't be under-estimated.  A song that was previously unreleased but I am glad it was put on this album!  It shows the early days and early beginnings of this hard rocking band. 4/5    16. Fire In The Hole (Demo 1991) -  Another rocking jam that was previously unreleased.  Just a pure rocking track and a great way to end a rocking album!  Hard and heavy with the quintessential Skid Row attitude! 4.5/5    Overall, this album is great for the casual fan that wants to get to know the band back in their prime!  Worth the price and will get you hooked to one of the best hard rock bands of the late 80's and early 90's.
0374530718|3.0|no one should mistake this for masterful fiction. it is not. rather gaarder's story is a nice delivery vehicle for a basic and interesting introduction to philosophy.  so if you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. if you are looking for an easy to read and relatively entertaining [though lengthy] introduction to western philosophy, pick this up.
B00008YLV2|5.0|I rate BLACK HAWK DOWN only below BAND OF BROTHERS as the best war dvd available (I don't include SAVING PRIVATE RYAN because of the Hollywoodized, heavy-handed ending) for its accurate and graphic portrayal of combat.  I have the 3-disc Deluxe edition, which I recommend over the 1-disc because it includes the History Channel's THE TRUE STORY OF \\"BLACK HAWK DOWN\\" and PBS' FRONTLINE: AMBUSH IN MOGADISHU. The tv versions give more information on the political situation which led to the battle (which are only briefly mentioned in the movie) and provide more accurate accounts of the battle (the movie had to change some details in order to fit the entire battle into the given time, make it easier for the movie audience to understand and dramatize certain events). The 3-disc set also includes features showing the enormous amounts of computer-generated special effects which are so realistic that I was unaware they were CGI (the first Black Hawk helicopter crashing is entirely CGI, the dust clouds during the helicopter landings are CGI, many of the explosions, etc. are also CGI).  In response to some earlier reviews, here's some clarifications:  1. In the movie, Pvt. Blackburn is shown falling from the helicopter rope after the helicopter suddenly swerves to avoid a rocket-propelled grenade. This is a dramatized version--the dvd commentary by the real Sgt. Eversmann said there's no real explanation for why Blackburn fell from the rope as Blackburn doesn't remember although everyone remembers the helicopter did suddenly jerk, but not to avoid a RPG.  2. Col. McKnight (Tom Sizemore) actually did walk upright during combat despite the constant Somali gunfire. This is mentioned in the book and the dvd commentary.  For the very best in movie portrayal of combat and war, I highly recommend this dvd set.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Although it really isn't history the way it should be as the real Commodus was a whole lot more bizarre than this one, and Maximus is as fictitious a character as one would think based on his name. It's a good thing though to familiarize modern audiences with the likes of Marcus Aurelius, however, and the movie deserves the accolades that it got. Russell Crowe is magnificent here as was Joaquin Phoenix. The latter's career is rising at present in the same manner as the mythic creature with the production of outstanding work in both The Village and Walk the Line. They're both excellent actors and are perfectly cast in this epic. Gladiator has about all you need from a film with constant action, beautiful sets, and an intriguing plot. It's a quick couple of hours and you'll find yourself surprised at how soon it is over. I fond it delightful.
B000000HHE|5.0|for a long time I felt this was their best album.  Now, I must own it in CD, (for my iPod & personal library). This is a classic!
068987474X|5.0|I wish every woman would read this book, because it says all the things I never have the heart to say in the face of a friend's breakup issues.<br /><br />This books tells it straight and keeps it to the point.  I like that it's said in a man's upfront, no-frills manner, too.  What a joy to read.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I found this version of Emma to be more enjoyable than the A&E production.  I found the characters to be more charming and distinctive in their roles, especially that of Mr. Knightly.  I enjoyed the subtle humor of this version.  I think it deserves a higher overall rating.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I knew this album of course before buying it, but it really amazes you when you listen to the whole thing song by song in your home stereo.
159562015X|5.0|I have taken the strenghthsfiner test 3 times, and it has been consistant throughout every test. If you want to learn how to maximize on your strenghths vs. worry about your weaknesses, this is the best investment you can make. The book allows you take the test online, and learn how to use your strenghths to your advantage in all aspects of your life. A must do, in my opinion.
1582701709|1.0|I think she's already made enough money!  Seriously, the emphasis on material goods without any corroborating emphasis on the effort it takes to succeed is simply disgusting.    We all have heard about the power of positive thinking.  Why do we need something so 'mysterious' as the 'secret' to tell us about it.  The law of attraction - please.  Do you think the universe really cares if you're rich?    But of course these folk know that so many of us are desperate for an easy way to wealth.  This isn't it.  Hard work, yes, postive thinking yes.  But not this.
B00000DOPQ|4.0|The songs of this album are sang by D. Warwick and written by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees. It is a very nice album. It is a must have if you are a Bee Gees/Barry Gibb fan, as well.
B000HWZ5W4|4.0|It's unlikely that an album such as this is going to win over new fans - I'd guess most people buying it are fans from the past.  So I'll address the three things those who are considering upgrading will care about:    1.  Does it sound better?  2.  Are the bonus tracks worthy?  3.  Is the booklet any good?    Is the sound better?  The quick answer is YES.  However, it's a MARGINAL improvement only.  It's much louder, so if you play your music with the stereo turned up to 5, then you might only need this disc on 3 (if that makes any sense).  There is EVER SO SLIGHTLY more clarity, and the bass  is tighter.  However, probably only audiophiles will care.  It is NOT a \\"night and day\\" difference.  When you adjust volume levels so the old disc sounds the same loudness wise, the differences are very minor.    Are the bonus tracks worth it?  Well there are four here.  The first \\"In the Mood Live\\" is actually quite bad.  Plant's vocal is out of tune on the harmonies, and the mix loses instruments every now and again, pushing the guitar to the back.  The second \\"Thru with the Two Step Live\\" is pretty good though.  It clocks in at 10 minutes, with an extended intro of more than 3 minutes.  The mix has settled, and it's a good listen.  The third is \\"Lively Up Yourself Live\\", a Bob Marley tune.  This is a good song, and while Plant simply covers it (not major changes really) it's a fun tune, and it's done by musicians clearly having a good time.  Finally, there's \\"Turnaround\\", an outtake from the original sessions.  This is by far the best bonus track here.  I wish they had put it FIRST among the bonus songs, so we could have enjoyed the sessions rather than have to wade through the live stuff first.      All in all, the bonus material is okay.  The studio track is great, the live stuff is nice, but not essential.    Finally the booklet.  They have taken the notes straight from the booklet of the box set from wence this came - they're not exhaustive, sadly.  Still, tey beat theoriginal release.    All in all then, this is a minor upgrade to a classic record.  Those expecting something revilutionary sound wise will be disapointed if they do a close examination.  The bonus tracks are't terrible though, and Plant is always great.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|LADY AND THE TRAMP is my favorite of all the Disney animated films.  It has great memorable characters from the down on her luck show dog Peg (voiced by the fabulous Peggy Lee who also voices a couple of other characters) to Aunt Sarah's sly pair of Siamese cats.  The music is also among the best from Disney with \\"Bella Noche\\", Quiet As a Snowflake\\" and especially \\"He's A Tramp\\" with the wonderful dog pound chorus as well as a couple of other memorable songs.  The film touts the virtures of both pure bred dogs like the beautiful sweet Cocker Spaniel Lady and also the advantages of mixed breeds like her clever Heinz 57 mate Tramp.  This movie is a must for dog lovers and can be enjoyed by all ages.
B000MTPANQ|3.0|Here's the skinny on the DVD: The extra features, such as a clip from Neil performing 2 songs on \\"the Johnny Cash show\\" and the footage of Neil on his ranch with the hired hand that inspired the song \\"Old Man\\", are pretty cool.  But I began to notice subtle differnces in the audio and the video (very subtle - but they're there).  Then it hit me: The video is NOT the same performance as the audio track.  That's why there is no video footage of the portions where Neil is speaking to the audience and on quite a few of the songs as well.  The video of this Massey Hall show doesn't exist.       This is what I would expect from a bootleg.  Why Neil Young feels the need to market a con such as these (see the reviews on the Filmore East show) is beyond me.  But I still love him...
B000OVLBEY|5.0|Excellent movie all the way around although I prefer the Sons of the Pioneer's rendition of \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\".    Would have bought it no matter who got the lead role - Cage just added a bit more class.    Eve still had her body exploited in the clothing. Glad she [as her character] walked away.    Fabulous renditions of the Rider's bike - really enjoyed the featurettes and the commentaries - they covered more of the story plot and the characters than the strict technicalities.  Enjoyed seeing the natural exchanges between the actors in the special features.    Love Sam Elliott - he was made for his part.  New that voice before ever he showed up.  What a man! Presence, charisma, sexy voice.    This movie just makes the comic characters more real - Am glad I collected some of them.    These comic book character renditions in movies just keep getting better.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DEFINITELY A KEEPER.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am not the type of a viewer who sees a movie over and over. But on the next day after I first saw this Pride and Prejudice, I couldn't help me from thinking of the beatiful scenes, reruning the whole thing, the words spoken by Mr. Darcy and Lizzie. I kept on searching for more and more of this movie on the Internet. And I had to come home earlier than I usually do to see this movie again. I had to finish this movie again without a single pause. Still so fresh, I just wanted to remember every bit of this movie. This movie \\"bewitched my body and soul\\". Not to mention the charm of Matthew MacFadyen who played Mr. Darcy, now I am planning on trip to Chatsworth in England where Pemberly, the house of Mr. Dacy, is.
0521783658|4.0|This book was written for ESL and EFL students. Most books of this type are boring and dull, but this particular collection is entertaining. I'm a native speaker who is accustomed to reading long, complex books, but I still found this book interesting enough that I read it all in one setting. The short stories all contain a twist or surprise, in the vein of Twilight Zone--in fact, a couple of stories are a little too reminiscent of that show and early science fiction short stories. Nonetheless, this is a great introduction to reading fluently and enjoyably in English. If you (as a teacher or a student) have only seen dull, stripped-down simplifications of classic novels as graded readers, give this a try. It's a pleasant surprise to find that \\"learner literature\\" can be engaging reading in its own right.
0007189885|4.0|I decided to read this book after Chimamanda won an award in London. The book was definitely worth reading. It grips you right from the very beginning and keeps you hooked till the very end. It also delves a lot into the Ibo Nigerian culture that makes me wonder if non-Nigerians can follow the entire story.    My only criticism is that the book is very simplistic, which may be a good thing for someone who just wants a very light reading.
B00000IP2L|5.0|As awesome as this CD is, don't be fooled by the picture of the cover art as shown. Due to a law suit from Johnny Walker, the cover art had to be changed. What you will get is a plain b&w photo with their trademark skull. But the bonus tracks that the original didn't have will obviously make you forget about the cover!!
0618680004|5.0|This book is remarkably fair, thorough and thoughtful.  Publisher Weekly's caustic review was obviously written by someone who reacted badly to irrefutable evidence that some of his his/her most cherished beliefs are false.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Some reviewers have complained of lack of action and a dull main character; of a man with no obvious feelings, dedicated only to secrecy in the service of `The Company'. If you want gung-ho, bullet dodging heroes then Tom Clancy and Harrison Ford are the guys for you. If you want to know where the men who are now running the USA (and hence the world) originated, and how they took a stranglehold on power, then watch this film.  It is an intelligent account of the early days of the CIA: an extension of a rich old boy's network that may have begun with honourable intentions, but soon became a cabal, protecting vested interests, and now views its purpose solely to nurture the interests of one percent of one country's citizens, at the expense of just about everyone else on the planet.  If that takes grey, violent men, obsessively secretive to the point of destroying their own families, then that's a price they willingly pay.<br /><br />The film succeeds admirably. De Niro maintains intelligence (pun intended) throughout, without pandering to target audiences or oversimplifying in case `they' won't understand it. Two or three viewings may be necessary to absorb everything here. Like Emilio Estevez's Bobby, I think this is a `where it all started to go wrong' film, inviting comparisons with today. As a Russian defector, at the end of his tether under torture says:<br /><br />`Soviet power is a myth. A great show. But there are no spare parts. Nothing is working. It's nothing but painted rust. But you. You need to keep the Russian myth alive to maintain your military-industrial complex. Your system depends on Russia being perceived as a threat. It is not a threat. It was never a threat. It never will be a threat. It is a rotten, bloated cow.'<br /><br />Even at two hours and forty minutes, I didn't want the film to end. The action, or conflict is unrelenting.  Thought provoking, clever, entertaining, well-acted and genuine. An oddity, in other words.
055358202X|4.0|The first three books in this series had me glued from the beginning, all the way through.  This one... wanders.  I was, like most others, deeply disappointed to find most of my favorite characters missing completely.  I understand why he chose to split the book this way (worked for Two Towers, didn't it?), but at the same time, it seems to me that most of the action is happening somewhere other than Westeros, and this book focused on Westeros.  I confess that I am completely uninterested in what the Ironborn (Theon's people) are doing, and I was really disheartened to find Cersei made a POV character.  She is completely despicable.  What I adored about the first three was the fact that you could be hating a character (prime example:  Jaime) and then he was made a POV character, and he kind of grew on you even though he's more than a little bit rotten.  Cersei... nothing to love, there.      Not much happening here except to make one really look forward to A Dance With Dragons.  Sometimes you gotta take the rough read to get to the good stuff in a fantasy series.  This is an example of that.  I'm not giving up on it yet... the tale is just too good.  Besides, I HAVE to know what happens to Dany.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I think this album is one of Incubus' best yet. There is not one song on this album that I dont like. If you like lyrics that have deep meaning and a sound that opens you up from the inside out through vocals and instrument, then this is for you.     For some reason Earth to Bella pt. 1 is getting a bad rep. I dont understand that at all. This song took me on a roller coaster ride the first time i listened to it and its one of my top 5 on the CD. My favorite song on the album is Oil and Water. You know, if you're reading these reviews and you're not sure whether or not to buy it, stop right now. Listen and judge the album for yourself. You wont be let down.    This is a different spin for Incubus and it was a good one. I have no complaints at all for this album. Buy it and enjoy the magic of INCUBUS.    A Kiss to send us off  Dig  Anna Molly  Earth to Bella pt. 1  *Oil and Water*   Diamond and Coal
B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.  I can't recall ever being so emotionally stirred up by a film before.  Unless you're a corporate CEO, or health-related industry lobbyist, you will be touched.  There were several points during the movie where I was moved to tears, both of sadness and anger.  Some funny moments too.  There were a few additional points I wished he would've touched on.  For instance, I would've liked to hear from some lower-income folks during his discussions with citizens of Canada, England and France.  But he covers a lot of territory, and does an amazing job of conveying his message.  Kudos to Mike!  I cannot recommend this movie enough!  Every American needs to see it.
B0001US8EO|1.0|Apparently this is Kasdan's attempt to turn the murderous old west into some kind of Spielberg-ian morality tale. Instead we get a film so stale and hollow it manages to make a mediocre actor out of even Gene Hackman. Uninspired dialogue delivered with all the craft of a voice-mail message. If the Old West isn't quite dead yet this one will do it. My biggest regret is that I had to contribute to this production in order to learn this. Comes with not one, but two cram-packed disks. Yippee-eye-ay!
B000002IST|4.0|We Can't Dance is, by virtue of being Genesis' \\"last\\" album, always going to be controversial. But I got heavy into Genesis in high school and I find it hard to say much bad about them to this day and age -- even as they were selling out, they were still playing with the formula, from the willful weirdness of \\"Lamb\\" and \\"Trick of the Tail\\", oddities like \\"And Then There Were Three\\" and \\"Duke\\" (an album I find, to put it charitably, unapproachable, though \\"Heathaze\\" was a surprising favorite), and then the clear musical progression from prog to slamming synth-rock embodied in \\"Abacab\\", \\"Genesis\\", and \\"Invisible Touch\\". And then came We Can't Dance, which, well, just sort of was. And there was I, passed out on the living room floor in the midst of my trig homework, listening to the new Genesis album. And it was good.    The album has its strong parts -- \\"No Son of Mine\\" is a gut check on the subject of child abuse and family harmony; \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" is more topical than ever fifteen years later; \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" is creepy, claustrophobic, and an all-around excellent song; \\"Fading Lights\\" is an instrumental tour-de-force that just happens to have lyrics. It has its weak points too. \\"Living Forever\\" sounds like a reject from the \\"Living Years\\" sessions from Mike + the Mechanics, cleaned up and progified; \\"Never a Time\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\" are trite and dull, and should have been left off the album; \\"Hold On My Heart\\", a favorite of my days of making mix tapes for girls who would never date me (yes, I was That Guy), has not aged well and makes me stabby. The remainder: \\"Driving the Last Spike\\" never quite lives up to its potential, coming off as a bit stoned, but is otherwise an excellent song; \\"Since I Lost You\\" is not bad but is very out of place; \\"Way of the World\\" is just mediocre.     On the whole, it's a good album, but it sometimes sounds a bit dated, mostly from the heavy emphasis on synthesizers that was already on the way out by the time this albumwent into production. It's also a very long album, a mistake Bruce Springsteen would make nearly a decade later with \\"The Rising\\", also an otherwise good album that simply had too much stuff in it for a person to listen to in a sitting. But, and this is a big but, it's not going to appeal to everyone. Someone who is primarily a fan of Gabriel-era Genesis would probably find it flabby and a bit toothless, while a fan of Collins-era Genesis might wonder what happened to the hyper-edgy synthpop sound of \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\". Ultimately, it's not for all tastes, and really, that's fine. But I liked it, and I still like it now.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Who doesn't know the general plot of this movie? Well just in case: Maria is thinking of becoming a nun, yet Sister Superior isn't so sure about that and sends her off to become the governess to seven Von Trapp children. There she meets the very strict father and the not so angelic children. She quickly wins over the children and their father. While all this is going on the Nazis are slowly but surely taking over the country. By the second half of the movie they become a true family and decide to make a dareing escape from the Nazis.  <br />Now that pretty much wraps it up plot wise, yet there is so much more. The songs are very sugar coated but so what? They are there for a purpose: teaching children to not be afraid, coaching them on how to sing,etc. In most parts they are there for the pleasure of the young and the young at heart.  <br />I'll close with an example. I was driving with my wife and our girls in the car, and we were looking at about an hour trip to my mother's house so we popped The Sound of Music in the DVD and we were on our way. As I heard (I coudn't see the movie of course) the movie and we sang the songs on our journey, I looked back and every face was smiling. Now if you are looking for a movie like that you've come to the right place.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|It is many years (and I mean years) since I saw the magic flute preformed here in NZ .I bought this DVD on the strength of one woman and she did not disappoint Diana Damrau has to be the best Queen of the Night I have seen for many a year she is exceptional.How this stunning young blonde turned into the Haus Frau from Hell is a tribute to her versitility and her ability as an opera singer.She has certainly tamed this very difficult part and made it her own .I have two of her DVD and intend to get others.Her daughter Pamina(Roschmann) is wonderful as a meek young woman long under her mothers thumb who finally finds herself and is able to deal with The Mother  and her prince is just as well cast as a strong young man whose ideals match those of Sarastro.What can we say about Keenylside as Papagano he is the best Funny yet so soulful and when he finally gets his girl he becomes the man he has always wanted to be not just the birdman.This wonderful production stands alone as a tribute to Sir Colin Davis long regarded as the best Mozartian interpreter .This is one dvd that I am so glad to own You will be too so buy it LOL
6305736650|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before about this movie? For those few that have been living under a rock: Casablanca is about Rick a Cafe owner who \\"I don't stick my neck out for nobody\\" is his life's motto, and how this motto begins to wreck at him when his old flame (has Ingrid Bergman ever looked better?) comes back into his life.  The movie has it all: Suspence, romance, humor (in spades), and that song!  Watch it, just because it's a classic.
0393327655|2.0|The main hope that Sam Harris seems to have is that society will reject irrational ideas like those espoused by religion, replacing those ideas with 'rational' ones which will lead to peace and harmony. Harris seems to think that religious zealotry is a primary cause is the worlds' major conflicts. If not religious zealotry per se, then 'extremism', as in the secular systems Facism and Communism in the 20th century. Wouldn't it be nice, he says, if one day we all woke up and we suddenly all had religious amnesia? Then we could build a rational society and live happily ever after.    This is nothing more than wishful thinking. Man does not operate by reason, but rather by self interest, and will always do so. The remarkable American theologian/philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr said it much better than I could: \\"...rationalists of all ages [are] too enarmored of the function of reason in life. The world of history, particularly in man's collective behavior, will never be conquered by reason, unless reason uses tools, and is itself driven by forces which are not rational.\\"    Even if many religious ideas are based on illusions rather than reality, they fill certain needs society requires to achieve cohesion and peace. They provide a metaphorical understanding of principals of ethics and decent living that, in the context of an under-educated society (ie all nations), allows the common man to become a good citizen and find purpose and hope in an otherwise difficult life.    Harris is correct that sometimes these religious ideas can go awry; who of us doesn't wish to see the form of Islamic Fundamentalism which cause 9/11 erradicated? However, Harris' simple analysis overshoots the mark; religion and religious ideas play a vital role in keeping an extraordinarily unjust world relatively stable.
0812975219|3.0|Its one of those books where I searched for a central idea till the end. I get it that we can be fooled by randomness but whats new to that ???    However, I liked the book in certain chapters, they ascertained the thoughts a deep thinking analytical mind may go through..    Once again good book but lacks a end that ties it together.
0143038419|5.0|I had decided to give this book 5-stars halfway through the Italy section, primarily because I giddily re-lived my own time in Rome through the author's account, but also because I really enjoyed her witty and conversational writing style.  I'm sticking with that rating, but not without a few comments....    My expectations were high by the time she arrived in India.  I really wanted her to find what she was looking for, and if ever there was a place for deep introspection and philosophical musings, this was it, right?  Unfortunately, I have to agree with some other reviewers that this portion of the book instead revealed the author to be very self-centered indeed.  Yes, this is *her* memoir of *her* own journey, but all the one-sided conversations became rather irritating after awhile.  She seemingly asked the same questions over and over of everyone she encountered (I was truly sick of hearing about David), and they all provided her with different levels of guidance and insight, but we simply don't know what, if anything, she gave to them in return.  At this point in the book, it appeared she was learning nothing -- she continued to simply dwell in her personal negativity and drain those around her.  Eventually she finds her way, but it takes, frankly, too many pages.  When she finally realizes that she talks too much about herself and her issues to the exclusion of others, I was relieved on behalf of her friends, her family, the ashram....    Even though parts of the India section disappointed, I didn't write her off entirely as being hopelessly dissatisfied with life.  I was willing to cut her a break.  She was obviously depressed -- very, very depressed -- and in need of continuing help.  Although the details of her divorce were not shared (nor should they have been), she was clearly dealing with more than the \\"typical\\" amount of grief associated with divorce and loss.  She described long-term thoughts of suicide, cutting, etc.  This woman was very bad off fora long time.  And like I said, I really wanted her to find what she was looking for.  I was still rooting for her!    To look at it another way, the author was being honest in her memoir and showing us all parts of herself, including the self-centered, desperate parts.  On the other hand, if this had been a novel -- that is, if she had purposely *written* a character so endlessly whiny -- I would've been among those throwing the book against the wall in frustration....    Bali was much better.  For one thing, outside of the ashram, she was able to focus her attention (and thus the reader's) on someone other than herself and the intricate inner workings of her mind.  Again, I was probably expecting more spiritual substance from her time with the medicine man, but in the end I recognize that she had actually achieved her overall goal soon after arriving in Bali, and it was time to move on to other, *unexpected* blessings.    So aside from the one complaint that the India section was more brooding than enlightening, I'm sticking with 5-stars, and I'll gladly recommend this book to others.    Allison
B000NVT0RU|3.0|I would not call this movie an epic, not by a long shot.  It is good, yes, the acting in fact is very good - but it is no \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".    Much of the fighting is small scale, still good, but not to the beach assault scenes that we have come to expect of great WW2 movie epics.  The story to be told, is certainly political, and while it is difficult to get emotionally attached or close to any of the characters in the movie you find yourself angered at the manipulation and lies that are used by the French Officers to coerce and cajole the Algerians to blindly continue the fight for their beloved France.    My only criticism of the movie would be that I found it extremely distracting that one of the main characters, Sai`d (actor Jamal Debbouze) went through the entire war with his right hand stuck in his jacket pocket and I kept wondering why?  I later found out that Debbouze, lost the use of his right arm in a childhood accident.  But surely, in a war movie such as this you would be able to find ample opportunity to write into the script a reason that would adequately cover such a wound - other than just having the arm super-glued into an army jacket pocket???  I mean to take nothing away from Debbouze's skill as an actor, because I thought he did a great job in the part as Sai`d in this movie, I just think it a shame that rather than allowing me to focus on the character he portrayed so well, my attention was constantly drawn to his damn right hand in that damn pocket!!
B00008976Y|1.0|Julie (Juliette Binoche) has just lost her husband and her little daughter in a car accident. She is emotionally shattered and withdraws into herself. Soon, we see her walking through her husband's mansion (he was a famous composer, and thus a wealthy man) and arranging to sell it. We see her sorrowful face in close-up. Several times she looks like she's about to cry. Then she steps outside, the camera zooms out, and we see that she is wearing stylish shoes with very high heels. In fact, her whole attire is very glamorous and fashionable.    That's what Julie's suffering is like: glamorous and fashionable, for the entire duration of the film. Kieslowski is serious about Julie's emotions, he wants her sorrow to move the audience. But nonetheless that stylized glamour suffuses every single scene. Every day, Julie goes out and broods by herself, not just anywhere, but in a fashionable cafe, over coffee and ice cream, served in elegant glassware.    She moves out of the mansion to an apartment in the city. Kieslowski means to suggest that this apartment is old and run-down, because the landlord says that it needs maintenance. But in the ensuing scenes, it looks stylish and expensive, full of tasteful furniture. Sometimes Julie chills out here in a chair. She stares ahead in mournful silence, but she doesn't forget to wear a chic sweater. Her apartment looks huge, by the way. If only I could find one of comparable size.    At night, Julie goes swimming. She can't sleep from suffering too much, so she goes to a vast, gorgeous crystal blue pool and swims back and forth. In the daytime, sometimes she quietly suffers on a bench outside. One time, an old woman shuffles by and tries to deposit an empty bottle in a recycling bin. But because she's bent double from old age, she can't reach the opening to put the bottle inside. Julie observes this, closes her eyes, and basks in the sunlight. Heaven forfend that other people's suffering should distract her from her own.    In another scene, some guy calls her and claims to have some \\"important business.\\" Julie tersely answers, \\"Nothing's important,\\" thus expressing her sadness and alienation. As she holds the receiver with that mournful look on her face, we admire her trendy, fashionable androgynous hairstyle.     Then, she suddenly finds that a mouse has made a nest in her closet. Julie sees that the mouse has babies, and feels sympathy. She broods over this matter for some time, then kills the mice anyway. But afterwards she feels really guilty, and even cries. A normal person would either kill the mice, or feel sorry for them and leave them alone, or kill them first and later come to regret it. But not our tortured heroine. She feels sorry for them first, but she has to kill them, just so she can feel and confess gnawing remorse.    Needless to say, Julie has no job (a fact she proudly flaunts before the landlord), but of course it turns out that she's a brilliant musician, capable of easily finishing her husband's incomplete concerto. Her husband, by the way, was not just any old composer. He was working on a special concerto in honour of the unification of Europe. This work was supposed to be played in all the European capitals on the day of unification.    This deliberately symbolic detail is the key to the film. Kieslowski loves Julie's elegance and wealth. He may not even want to emphasize it, but he can't help it, it's everywhere. And that's why the music is about, not just any old thing, but the unification of Europe. This is what unification means to Kieslowski -- a magical transformation after which everyone will become rich, dress fashionably and sit in expensive cafes, full of elegant and aesthetic melancholy. He desperately craves this wealthy elegance, and he wants us to admire it as well.    Every aspect of the film is subordinate to this vision. The dialogue, for instance, is very heavily stylized. The characters don't talk, they make exhibitionistic declarative statements.Julie meets her husband's mistress, who is also elegant and beautiful. The following exchange takes place: \\"Excuse me.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"You were my husband's mistress.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Instantly they know each other, instantly they understand and soon they reconcile. I found myself thinking of Bergman's later films, where routine and convention make it impossible for characters to express themselves in such a straightforward manner, and anyone who tries finds the attempt very painful. But in Kieslowski's vision, the unification of Europe instantly removes such barriers along with all other problems.     Juliette Binoche came to \\"Blue\\" not long after finishing \\"Lovers On The Bridge\\" with Leos Carax. In fact, Carax is also fond of stylized, glamorous romanticism, but his version of it is heedless and irrational, and frequently opposed to fashion and wealth. In his film \\"Bad Blood,\\" he occasionally cuts to a black screen for a moment, and then cuts back to the scene. Kieslowski plunders Carax's technique as well as his actress, but in his hands, the same technique is used as an overt signal to the audience that something important is happening. Where Carax's cuts last only a second, and occur more or less randomly in his film, Kieslowski makes them last longer, and adds sudden bursts of majestic violins, the better to illustrate that the moment is weighty with emotional significance. Unsurprisingly, Carax is widely viewed as a failure, and Kieslowski is lauded as a genius.    \\"Blue\\" combines elegant coldness and cheap sentimentality, both meant to induce narcissistic self-pity. First Julie throws away a copy of her late husband's unfinished masterwork, then she finds another copy and finishes it. There's no real difference between these two acts -- both serve to assert Julie's great importance. And underwriting the film's self-obsessed heroine is the director's passionate love for those elegant, beautiful, callous people who will inherit the world after unification.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|All the greats, Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolve, even Jecke & Hyde make an appearance in this film.  The movie is dark and sometimes the plot seems a little thing, or the director introduced something but never returned to it.  The movie is good basic entertainment, if you are looking for a high-grade movie or classic, you should probably look elsewhere.  This was great for entertainment, but I didn't add it to my library.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Let me start by saying that as a huge Megadeth fan since 1988, figuring out which stage of Dave's career I want to listen to when I have the craving for some of this awesome band is a big part of the enjoyment.  Before my short review of the newest creation, United Abominations, let me say this...  I've read many reviews of the band's catalog on here and find it funny how each different album is a bunch of people's favorite while being a number of people's \\"pathetic excuse for a Megadeth album\\".  I have yet to find one I don't like, although one or two took a while to get into (The World Needs A Hero, for example).  To imagine a \\"thrash\\" band with a lead singer without much vocal range lasting into the later part of this decade 15 years ago (while maintaining a certain amount of mainstream popularity), would have seemed insane by itself.  But to be able to distinguish each subsequent album from each other with the limitations this format and vocal style can bring is what makes Megadeth one of the best bands out there still today.  To say what my favorite album isn't possible.  When I want to hear pissed off, drug induced eighties thrash, Peace Sells it is....When I want the best technical speed album ever made, RIP gets cranked.....If it's memories of my favorite high school album, out comes Countdown.....Awesome mid-90's metal with a different edge?  I'm taking Youthanasia or Cryptic Writings out of the rack....Then I remember my favorite under-produced late 80's gem, SFSG..SW.......The beginning?  Killing, it is....And the most bashed album, Risk, definitely has a place in my collection as well.  Of course I can't listen to all these right now, because my current fave, System is on rotation.  Ripping all my CD's to the pc and putting on a \\"Megadeth shuffle\\" gives me 11 hours of the best mix I could want.....ALL OF IT!  Forget the two greatest hits packages, they couldn't put them on 5 CD's, let alone one.<br /><br />After that essay, I won't spend too much time on my actual review, except to say....WE HAVE A NEW MEGADETH ALBUM, and guess what?  It ROCKS!!  Did I expect anything less?  Of course not.  Pleasant surprise having Christine Scabbia (of Lacuna Coil) on the remake of one of Dave's best songs, A Tout Le Monde, for sure!  The rest of the album sounds a bit like a cross between Rust In Peace and The System Has Failed, and it works well.  Awesome riffs and solos once again.  It certainly can't be said (by those who always use the term on here) that Megadeth sold out on this one.  I have yet to hear when they have, but that doesn't matter.  What matters is that as a fan for almost 20 years, to have the mighty Dave Mustaine (with whatever supporting cast he is using) still making the freshest, non-dated music within this potentially limiting genre, is a welcome gift with each new release.<br /><br />This album is another 5 star release from this band that has no equal.....you won't be disappointed if you relish in all of Megadeth's music as I do.<br /><br />Coulda done without the \\"Hey Jihad Joe....We're coming to get you!\\" line in Amerikhastan, though.tual review, except to say....WE HAVE A NEW MEGADETH ALBUM, and guess what?

Coulda done without the \\"Hey Jihad Joe....We're coming to get you!\\" line in Amerikhastan, though.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|'Miss Potter' is thoroughly British.  Complete with dry wit and charm, Rene'e Zellweger takes the lead in this thoroughly benign and lovable portrayal  of Beatrix Potter, the fanciful creator of the 'Peter Rabbit' series.   (Which remains the most successful children's literature in UK history.  Although I wonder if 'Harry Potter' is giving her a run for her money.)      A spinster still living at home, Beatrix is an avid artist who loves to sketch animals.  Her absorbing interest is illustrated by the pictures coming to life with animated motion whilst she talks to her creations.  Whether this is factual or fanciful matters little as it shows her zeal in her own creations, and effectively demonstrates how artists often have difficulty separating their own world with the ones they devise.  In the background is her interest in men late in life, a matter of importance to her family and especially her friend, Millie.  This aspect comes from the backdrop to the forefront as Mr. Warren, her publisher, not only fancies her books, but herself as well.    Besides drawing a parallel with her absorbed interest in her work, Zellweger delivers a well-rounded sketch of her heroine.  We see Beatrix come face life on her own terms, blossoming late in life and becoming assertive with her own affairs.    Seeming at first to have a perfect life, there is, nevertheless, heartache in portions to create some tension, but how she copes is itself keenly interesting.     Entirely innocent and drawing from such humor as putting a nip of brandy in the holiday coffee and servants who line up to snoop on the latest family developments, make 'Miss Potter' enchanted entertainment, indeed.
B00005JPHT|4.0|I personally would not call myself a HUGE Michael Moore fan, - which is rare seeing that people seem to either completely despise the man OR totally idolize him. I am not biased what so ever ... and I believe that his previous films tended to try to bash you over the head with the same topics over and over again until you found yourself walking out of the theater with a bit of a headache. Don't get me wrong though, - at times - they can prove to be thought provoking Documentaries with just the right touch of satire.<br /><br />In my eyes Mr. Moore is alot like Rolling Stone magazine - the way that he is SO liberal and SO against the direction the Country is headed. Yet I still seem to find myself with a Subscription to Rolling Stone and a Opening Day Ticket for ANY of his films.<br /><br />The bottom line is that he is a gifted Director with ALOT of built up feelings that is .... interesting ... to see unfold unto a screen. Even though he does get a bit carried away ...<br /><br />All that being said - I think I enjoyed \\"Sicko\\" more than his previous two films ... ahhh heck ... I liked them as well.<br /><br />Is it to much to ask for Fourths?
B000MX7V5M|5.0|The video quality of this special edition is excellent.  Though the packaging doesn't refer to it as being a remastered version, the video image is clearer than my previous DVD.  I think it was worth the cost to upgrade.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|The movie was fun with typical Hugh Grant humor. The songs from the movie are original. Oddly enough, they are also a strange \\"flashback\\". I purchased the album because the songs became addicting and I couldn't get them out of my head. Usually, I try anything to get such song out of my head. I'm happy I chose otherwise because they are just plain fun.
B000FA57US|4.0|Donald Pleasence is hard core kids. Don't forget it. I esspecially like his performance in this film. An aggravated, gun carying, psychiatrist really looking forward to november 1st. This is a good movie that wraps up the fourth film and gives us a taste of the thorn storyline to come.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Even if you have already seen all the episodes, this dvd has enough extras to make the purchase more than worth while.  There are actor profiles, making of extras, and some of the funniest commentaries I have ever heard.
0553588486|5.0|Let me start by saying I am not really into reading high fantasy stuff.  I enjoyed TSR novels, when I was a kid, but for the most part, I find the genre to be overly rigid, overwrought, and generally unimaginative.<br /><br />A friend insisted that I read this, someone who's recommendations I take seriously.  I was skeptical, naturally.  He found a sample chapter and forced it on me.  The story got its hooks in me within the first 30 pages, and after that it flowed, it positively galloped.  I found myself reading 200 pages at a clip.<br /><br />The detail is so rich, the story so well told.  I know it sounds cliche, but it really genuinely takes you there, through the eyes and voices of each character's chapters. You find yourself loving characters you should hate, and hating characters you should love.<br /><br />It seemed like a heavy read, glancing over the book, with all the plot intrigue, names, places, and dozens of interweaving family lines, but it's written so well, it never feels heavy, or dry, or textbookish.  You get the eons of history, the details and politcs, without even realizing it.<br /><br />I had to add my five stars, and my shining review.  I am SO glad I found this book at the beginning of summer, I look forward to reading the rest.
1400063515|5.0|To be quite honest, my rating of the book was changing from five to three stars and back while I was reading it, but now I am back to five stars. And the reasons are:    It's so easy to get affected  (insulted, offended, frustrated) by Taleb's style - arrogant, often rude, all this absolutely deliberate. It's not that easy to brush off these emotions and begin to really think about the ideas presented. Once you do it (I guess, some of the reviewers didn't get to this stage), you should be able to enjoy the book. I think that all this arrogance is not only a pose, but also like a publishing trick. The more controversial is the book, the more people talk about it , the higher are the sales (on the cynical side), the more people get acquainted with the Black Swan idea (on the positive side). I would say whatever it takes to get people to read this book is really good. So, no points are taken out for the style. Even though, on the other hand - I really can not predict (:-)!) how many readers would be more open to Taleb's ideas, if not for his presentation.    On the other hand - while it's easy to argue with Taleb on minor points (not 100% accurate examples, or replacing strict proof with stories in some places), I do agree with him on the major points.   First, social and economic events really do not follow the same laws as physical events - and it's dangerous and counterproductive to think otherwise. In the least dangerous scenario, your economic theory will not prove anything (Eric D. Beinhocker does more elegant job of explaining it in \\"Origin of Wealth\\"...). In the worst case, the security measures in the airlines will not be implemented due to the small probability of ....(OK, all of us know that explosives could be masqueraded as innocent liquids... do we know what the next generation explosive would look like?)   Second, we really don't know what we don't know, and all risk management tools that are not taking it into account, are flawed. Again, NNT is not oneand only to talk about it; to name only one, Daniel Kahneman talked about it in his latest interview; many business leaders also recognize this fact and try to implement the new way to hedge the risks.  Third, NOWHERE in the book Taleb says \\"There is no point to plan for the future, since you can not predict Black Swan\\". Just the opposite - he recognizes human tendency to plan as a natural one; he simply encourages us to incorporate probability of Black Swan in our plans (not to worry about small risks, and worry only about the things that are worth it - I'll take it as my day-to-day advice)    Summarizing it, if you are ready to be annoyed by every second page, but able to put your emotions aside, you would be rewarded - you will get another point of view, new ideas to think about - and you will twist your brain for a couple of months, looking for arguments and contra-arguments.     If you are afraid to spend money on the book and be angry with it in the end, hedge your risks - borrow it in the library first; you'll either end up buying it anyway or never finish more than first 10 pages.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|Bottom Line:  Other than Eva Mendes' cleavage, this movie was pretty dumb.  The dialog was campy and the plot was see through.  Seemed like a set up for a sequel; Note to Studio: Don't bother.  If the director was going for a cheesy kind of comic book thing, he hit it right on.  The problem is that this is a big screen movie - go read the comic book if you are looking for cheese.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|While it's better than 95% of the junk out there, this is not the geniune blues/rock that he played in his earlier albums.  Overly produced and not really interesting.  I doubt this will be part of anyone's ipod rotation in 6 months.  The lyrics are a little annoying too--it would have been better if slurred his lyrics more, so we could not hear the actual words.  Get \\"Elephant\\" or \\"White Blood Cells\\" if you don't have those WS albums yet and save this one for last.
B000NDDHG8|4.0|This is the real \\"High Voltage\\", AC/DC's first Australian release ever.<br />I'ts not a great effort, the band is clearly stil trying to define their sound, but the roots are all there.<br /><br />An obrigatory purchase for ny AC/DC / Bon Scott fan.
B00000761W|5.0|SWEET SATISFACTION, READY AND WILLING....... A classic album of a classic rock band, symply great with John Lord, Ian Paice..... This is the cd for you....
B000OYC3J8|3.0|Back in the early 2000s, garage rock was going to be the \\"next big thing\\" after the forthcoming decline of pop-punk and Britney Spears. You had The Hives, The Vines, and perhaps most importantly, The White Stripes. Perhaps it was their mystique (Are the brother and sister? Husband and wife?), or maybe it was Jack White's amazing ability to take a single guitar and make it sound like anything he wanted it to, but The White Stripes have hung around long after all those other bands faded into \\"Oh, who sang that one song?\\" territory. For better or for worse, The Stripes have stuck to their guns, staying true to the music that got them rich and famous. But should we still care?<br /><br />If the title track is any indication of what's coming on the rest of the album, the answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\" Unfortunately, it isn't. \\"Icky Thump\\" is a raw channeling of classic rock 'n' roll with some added Stripes flair. Jack White is at his absolute best here, utilizing his singing, half talking method of delivery that has helped in their rise to fame. At the same time, some of his lyrics are just absurd. Take, for example, \\"White Americans want nothing better to do. Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too!\\" Umm, sorry Jacky boy. That's not exactly how it works. Stick to the guitar and save yourself the embarrassment that is sure to accompany your haphazard political statements.<br /><br />\\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\\" has a more traditional southern rock sound to it. In my initial listen to the song, I wasn't too impressed. However, I was surprised to find its melody stuck in my head later in the day. Still, we've heard this all before from the band, so it is more of a guilty pleasure than anything else. \\"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\\" is a really great song, despite the fact that it's one of the calmest songs on the album. The guitar riff that runs throughout the song is absolutely infectious, and the screechy, chaotic solos are just as impressive. When Jack sings, \\"One thing's for sure; in that graveyard I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes\\" I chuckled a little bit and though that it could very well be the coolest ending to a song that I've heard in a while.<br /><br />Perhaps the most impressive song on the album is \\"Conquest,\\" a cover of Patti Page's 1950's battle of the sexes classic. The song has a very south of the border feel to it, complete with mariachi trumpets and Jack White's belting of \\"Coooooonqueeest!\\" It is a very stylish, and cool song. \\"Bone Broke\\" has classic White Stripes written all over it. Jack's vocals are completely thrashed with distortion, and there are hints of \\"Fell In Love With a Girl\\" all over it, despite it's toned-down nature.<br /><br />There are very few notable tracks throughout the album's second half, which is perhaps the biggest flaw of \\"Icky Thump.\\" Most of the songs end up bleeding into one another, sounding unbearably similar. In fact, the only thing really worth listening to are the things Jack does with the guitar. \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\" and \\"A Martyr for My Love for You\\" both feature impressive guitar parts, the latter of which is actually a fairly decent song. \\"Effect and Cause\\" closes the album out nicely. A simple acoustic guitar song, Jack's vocals are impressive, and it's nice to hear the band trade layers of distortion for a relatively calm feel.<br /><br />\\"Icky Thump\\" is truly hit and miss. While there are some impressive tracks on the album, the band really brings nothing new to the table. Of course, when you're a two-person band and one of your members really can't play their instrument, it's tough to evolve. The White Stripes may have stuck around long after all those other \\"The-bands\\" fell off the face of the planet, but their music is just as stale. That may be a harsh assessment, but six albums into their career, The White Stripes have not progressed at all. Though it's nice to hear a little rock 'n' roll every now andthen, these guys aren't saving the genre. They're choking it to death.<br /><br />Recommended for long-time fans of The White Stripes, and to anyone who likes classic rock but find themselves asking \\"Who are the White Stripes?\\" You'll find them refreshing.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Icky Thump\\"<br />2. \\"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\\"<br />3. \\"Conquest\\"<br />4. \\"A Martyr for My Love For You\\"<br />5. \\"Effect and Cause\\"<br /><br />5 out of 10 Stars.

B000PHX8QQ|5.0|solid, hard core, bass, dont stop the beat.  you just can't help but d.a.n.c.e.
1592402690|5.0|I never thought I would be on the edge of my seat reading about the recording of \\"A Day In The Life\\", but there I was... I found this book to be such an inspiration musically.  Before reading this I was a big fan of the Beatles but didnt know much about them and I'm not really a fan of celebrity gossip, so finding a book that focuses on the music and creative process was really great.  Several reasons why I liked this book:  1) It shows rock n'roll's meta-deities as mere mortals who required many, many takes to get a single melody/solo recorded.  Now I can be a little more easy on myself... hehehe.  2) You read about some of the studio tricks, the experimentation and the orchestrations used to get some of the great Beatles sounds.  3) You learn about what role George Martin and Geoff Emerick had in adding to the Beatles sound and you can only imagine how they would have sounded without these two.   4) It made me want to buy a reel-to-reel to add to my digital recording studio.  5) OK, OK I must concede that reading about Yoko lounging around in a bed in the Abbey Road Studios during the recording of the Abbey Road album was pretty weird and has tickled that deep dark guilty pleasure zone for odd celebrity gossip that I just said I had no interest in.
B000P2A24W|5.0|**UPDATE** okay the newness has worn off - still, it deserves 4 stars    Bon Jovi is my favorite rock band. But I'm realistic. I know they won't go down in history as having the best lyrics or the best vocals, and I not every song they've got is 5 star level - but when you put it all together they've got the sound, the lyrics, the soulful groove, and that extra `put everything you got into it' quality that, put together, make them the best in my opinion. But that doesn't mean I'm automatically going to give everything they put out 5 stars. To measure the quality of Lost Highway I went back to listen to all their albums to see how the new album measured up. So that you know where I stand I've rated all their regular albums based on a point system. Here are the results:    1. Have A Nice Day, 2. These Days, 3. Lost Highway, 4. Keep the Faith, 5. New Jersey, 6. Slippery When Wet, 7. Crush, 8. Bounce, 9. Bon Jovi, & 10. 7800 Degrees Fahrenheight    Going through chronologically: Their early albums rocked harder then I remembered, the music is great, but the lyrics aren't as full of content or mature as later on, which is fine - they were young and their sound at the time reflects that. Keep the Faith marks the beginning of their maturing and really hitting their groove. These Days has everything, it's probably my most listened to album. Ah, then we come to Crush, their 2000 comeback after being gone for 5 years, it has a lighter, ever so slight, electronic pop sound to it. It's strength - Just Older. But Captain Crash And The Beauty Queen From Mars took points off this album. Bounce is an unusually serious and heavy sound on tracs 1-3,7,9,11. Have A Nice Day was a strong comeback from Crush and Bounce. This title trac opens it up strong - gone is the heavy laiden guitar pounding off Bounce, and back is their classic hard rocking sound throughout. The only exception being Who Says You Can't Go Home duet with Jennifer Nettles. Yet it sounded good, not my favorite song onthe album, but I really like it.     Now Lost Highway - at first listen I liked it, I mean I really liked it. I can't remember the last time I bought an album and liked it so much. It's consistently good material and it's consistently Bon Jovi. Nearly all of the songs rock (like normal). Relax - it's not a country album. Only these few tracs have a country tinge to them: 1 - Lost Highway, the second weakest song on the album, \\"plastic dashboard Jesus\\"? Come on guys, 4 - Whole Lot Of Leavin' the Keith Urban wannabe song, and 11 - One Step Closer - good though. 5 - We Got It Going On with Big and Rich is the weakest song on the album and just a weak song period. But let's not forget that Big and Rich and LeAnn Rimes aren't exactly country compared to say, George Strait.    Anyway the remaining tracs are great:  2 - Summertime, classic Bon Jovi rockin' and having fun.  3 - (You Want To) Make a Memory, Like the band said it doesn't sound like anything else out there, but it sounds like Bon Jovi and it's already one of my favorites, I'm liking it more and more.  6 - Any Other Day, Starts with some guitar picking, but rocks no less than anything on previous albums.  7 - Seat Next To You, Nothing out of the ordinary, ballad.  8 - Eyerybody's Broken, Solid and rockin'.  9 - Til We Ain't Strangers Anymore with LeAnn Rimes is a solid rocking ballad.  10 - The Last Night, if anything this one sounds to have a slight Don Henley influence.  12 - I Love This Town, again Bon Jovi rockin' and having fun.    I feel Lost Highway merits A four star rating. It may be a little more ballad heavy then previous albums, but that's one of their strengths. I would like to see their next album rock hard like the old days with the songwriting and maturity strength of today. Anyway, be sure to get the version with two bonus tracs (offered here on Amazon or at Target). Walk Like a Man is awesome.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|First off I want to say that I very much enjoyed this movie.  I just didn't like the ending.  And in case you didn't see the phrase \\"spoiler alert\\" in the title of this review, here's a second warning to go no further if you haven't already seen the movie--because it's very much worth viewing, even if you end up not liking the ending.  This is one of those rare instances where an ending I disliked didn't ruin the whole movie for me.  It's that likeable.    So anyway, I'm sitting there watching the movie, and when it gets to the point where Will Ferrell's character has made up his mind that he does in fact need to die, I thought I had the ending figured out.  As he's going through his daily routine for the last time, and the movie starts gearing up for what we all know is coming, I began thinking to myself what a genius little movie this was.  Because I thought I'd figured out how it was going to end.    Here's the scenario that played out in my head.  Will Ferrell's character gets all the way to the bus stop, the kid on the bike crashes in front of the oncoming bus, and Will gets ready to step in front of the bus to push the kid out of the way.  But then, out of nowhere, Emma Thompson's character appears.  She pushes Will to the side as she rushes past him to save the kid.  Then, right after she pushes the kid to safety, the bus hits her full on.  After a few harried moments of panic and shock, Will falls on his knees next to Emma and asks her why she did it.  As the light fades from her eyes, she tells him, \\"I couldn't let you die like the others.  Go, live your life and be free.\\"    Genius.  Not my attempt at movie dialogue, but the idea that the movie is a comedy, but ends like a tragedy but makes you feel happy anyway.  I loved it.  And as I continued to watch, that's what I wholly expected to happen.  But then Will gets smacked by the bus and Emma's nowhere in sight.  Then we switch to the hospital, where he's merely banged up a bunch, but still alive.  Then, Emma's \\"sacrifice\\" is seen to be that her book is now merely okay instead of great.  What kind of lame sacrifice is that?  Why not have her give the ultimate sacrifice and thus elevate this movie to truly great status and match the rest of the movie's greatness?    A lost opportunity, to be sure.  But I still liked it.  That should say something, right?

B000NA28HU|1.0|It's been a long time since I watched a film that was so bad, so unspeakably corny, that I couldn't finish it. This was one. Obviously seeking to ride on the coat-tails of LOTR (I mean, calling the hero almost \\"Aragorn\\"!), the mixture of bad acting, dastardly villains in dark holes (why do dastardly villains always live in dark holes?) and worst of all, a blue-eyed telepathic dragon exhausted my patience. Advise evasive action.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I submitted an earlier comment about this marvellous, and to me, the definitive television series about World War II.  At the time of its preparation, this series was made in an era where there were only three terrestrial television broadcasters in the UK.  Satellite and Cable TV was still about fifteen years into the future.  As I have never visited the United States I can only write from ignorance, but in those far-off days I gather it was very difficult to sell a British sourced television series - especially a documentary series - to the American networks, as they would dismiss such a project as being rather too parochial.  If I was an American with a college education i would regard such a patronising attitude as rather insulting.  Nowadays however, with the growth of cable TV and the internet, the monopoly, terrestrial broadcasters can't hold their captive audience by their tender parts.  Therefore, it is surprising that a UK commercial television broadcaster, namely the long defunct Thames Television Co., should embark on the production of such a land mark series.  It was the perfect time to do this.  The technology was there.  The principal actors in this real life drama were still present and their collective memories still vivid.  The audience, many of whom would regard this subject as recent history, was there and a curious younger generation (such as I) who had heard all the stories and all the tales of yore but wanted to know more of what our mom's and dad's had gone through, were endlessly curious; so the early seventies was a time-slot that just had to be exploited before the opportunity had passed once and for all times, before the principal players had left the stage.  My Dad was in Burma doing unpleasant things to the Japanese and my Mom worked ten hour shifts in a plant producing medical equipment.  Both of their families were bombed out of their respective homes - thus I never knew my maternal grandparents.  To be British in those days meant thatthe battle front was over the top of your head!  Especially for my relatives as they all resided in suburbs between the plants that produced Spitfire fighter aircraft, and factories that churned out Lee Enfield rifles, Bren guns, Sten guns, Naval shells of all gauges, Artillery shells, Webley revolvers, Rolls Royce Merlin aero-engines, Mortar bombs and rifle ammo - all within around twenty square mile of the city of Birmingham.  Prime targets that the Nazi Luftwaffe had to eliminate if they wanted to win the war.  Birmingham was the most heavily `Blitzed' British city outside of London and there is still evidence of this to be seen here even today.  Those who are not aware of these vital facts should also be made aware that nearly every city in the UK, and there are very many of them, were paid unwelcome visits by Heinkels and Dorniers and Messershmidts, with full bomb loads and an attitude!   So purr-lese - all those American viewers who winge about this series being \\"Anglo-centric\\", should please bear in mind that that Thames Television probably never thought this series would ever be such a `hit' in the US as it subsequently became.  Its prime audience was expected to be British so if the war in the Pacific doesn't exactly get the coverage it deserves don't get blaming Thames Television for such an obvious oversight.  It wasn't Churchill's fault that Britain didn't contribute much to this theatre: we didn't have the right ships and more significantly US Admiral Earnest King didn't want us `Limeys' there in the first place.  `Tis a pity that he had such a downer on us as folks of my parents generation as even now they still tend to go all misty-eyed about  the legendary `Yanks' with their nylons and Hershey bars and jitter-bugs, and their kindly generosity of spirit that it is not in the nature of the English to show appreciation for.  When things get down and get dirty we all know who our true friends are...
055358202X|2.0|While the skill displayed in Mr Martin's narrative hasn't diminished, it is the case in all novels that some characters are more interesting than others.  A Feast For Crows seems fixed the less interesting of the characters we've seen.  While there are high points through the story, it seems overall lackluster beside the other entries in A Song of Fire and Ice, but if you're invested in the series, I doubt that there's any way you could gloss over this title.<br /><br />If you're not yet invested in the series, a really good set of Cliff's Notes might be an option in the future.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I never thought that i'd be writing a positive review on a Rihanna album, but I am!  I'm very impressed with how this album is produced and executed.  Very good production with pretty good vocals. It's a true pop album. (Kind of pop/rock) I love Sell Me Candy.   If she could only make good videos with bangin live performances, then she could be a superstar.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Normally when a classic rock band decides to release a new album, the results are never good.  It's just never as good as the classic stuff.  However, this Rush album is actually a pleasant surprise.  \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" is absolutely one fantastic song, and the other songs I've heard from it rock REALLY hard.  Good stuff.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|This is a solid well done action movie with all a guy wants. It has a solid yet kinda seen it before with \\"Most Wanted\\" plot. A dark Government agaency appealing to a die hard former snipers patriotic convictions, sets him up to take the fall for an assassination. A very attractive female lead, and not least neck snapping action. I cant say I love tons of CGI in action movies. I dont get the watered down CGI here. Now lets talk about Mark Wahlberg for a minute. I hate action movies where you have a former\\" insert special ops branch here\\" who doesnt know what he is doing or seem comfortable with weapons. Mark pulls it off brilliantly.He handles weapons like he was born with them. Watching him use a micromiter to set the firing pins on his rifles so the weapon wont shoot. His scenes spray painting camo on his rifles. The way his trigger finger stays outside the trigger gaurd until he makes  a shot.That is real ladies and gentlemen. The martial arts he employs are real no bs techniques.  Watch him take down a cop with a knife hand strike to the throat. The only part of that shot that isnt real is it is a kill strike.He made the movie belivable for a vet like me. Beautiful locations, heart stopping action sequences, realistic characters, I loved it. Micheal Pina plays a great sidekick. The movie has all that I look for and none of what I dont want It will be in my collection tomorrow. Brilliant execution. If you want a great action movue this is it.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being A Wallfower by Stephen Chbosky is definitely one of the greatest books I've ever read, and I love to read. Seriously, this book is great. It is written in letter format and takes place in 1991-1992. It tells the story of an adolescent boy named Charlie who writes letters to an unknown firned about what goes on in his daily and personal life. The books starts off with the death of one of his friends, which leaves him and all his friend's depressed. His is a freshman in high school and writes about the hardships he endures, and his new friends. This is definitely not just a teen book but a book that everybody over the age of 13 will enjoy! This book truly relates to what some high-schoolers have to go through, and this memoir is beyong doubt fascinating. If you only read one book in your lifetime, this is for sure the book to read.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Smiths really are the greatest pop band of all time. The Cure is my favourite band, but The Smiths are undeniably the best. I discovered \\"The Queen is Dead\\" when I was twenty (in 2000), and it served as my introduction to the band. I really was not a keen fan of the whole Brit-pop thing and thus had really glossed over this guys. I bought the album after 'Frankly, Mr. Shankly' made its way into repeat on my brain. My first response was disappointment with the rest of the album. Little by little different songs grew on me, and within two moths I was obsessed with the record. That summer I did not by another record for 4 months, and usually I buy about 20 records during the school break. Morrissey is the only singer whose words have the power to haunt me during a day. Right now 'The Queen...' is once again on constant repeat in my car. All the Smiths records are incredible and their abilitly to capture the hearts and minds of audiences really is unparalleled.    If you don't have this record and you loved early U2, New Order, Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen, Depeche Mode records, you need this in your collection. If you love the so-called 'indie-movement' of today and like bands like Death Cab for Cutie, Xiu Xiu, Interpol, Sufjan Stevens, you need this album. Actually you'll want this album. And I'm jealous of anyone who gets to fall in love with this album for the first time. But, then again falling in love with it all over again treats one pretty well too.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|Like \\"Mary Poppins\\". A charming story of adventure, imagination, and warmth. England, a 1920's race-car, charming children, their inventor father, a pretty woman, romance, an evil baron ruler of Vulgaria, a castle, a peasant village, songs and dancing, humor, and fun.    Good songs by the same Sherman brothers who wrote the songs of \\"Mary Poppins\\". Same dance choreographer from \\"Mary Poppins\\". Based on the novel by Ian Fleming, a real life secret agent in World War II. Movie script by Ronald Dahl, who wrote \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". Dick Van Dyke, and an all-star cast, though many unknowns. A very creative real-life inventor created the interesting inventions. A lot of bright, talented, people came together for this film. Too bad they can't make them like this anymore.    I bought this Special Edition for the second disc with the behind-the-scenes. An interesting look at the real life inventor behind the interesting inventions. I also enjoyed the interview with Dick Van Dyke.    I also bought the other full-screen edition, for the better, natural picture quality. It is not a big difference. Full-screen edition does not have the behind-the-scenes.     The producer of James Bond films gave the Disney team a free hand, but could not restrain himself from interjecting one risque' singing scene with a scantily clad baroness. However, the focus of the scene is humor and a good song. It is a great duet, with some great melodramatic acting. Though the scene would have been better with a modestly dressed baroness.   The rest of the film is a Disney style.
1596912855|5.0|This book was an absolute pleasure to read - a guilty pleasure - like chocolate on a diet.  Satisfying in an almost sinful way.  Shannon Hale has an incredible ability to create realistic characters that you can't help but fall in love with.  Her narrative is beautiful, romantic, and oh so witty.  (I laughed out loud several times, \\"The man deserved to be spited.  Or spitted.  Or both.\\" HA! Austenland pg. 83) This is a perfect read for all of us Mr. Darcy fans that need a quick fix.  The book can be read in about the time it takes to watch the BBC version and is equally, (dare I say) if not more enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a love for Jane Austen, a great sense of humor, and a need for a fun romantic get away!
1582701709|5.0|In my opinion this book and movie is not intended to solve all your problems, or does it talk about positive thinking with no action will bring results, the Law of Attraction is one of many universal laws, the purpose behind this material is to bring a sence of AWARENESS to many so that they will go forward and start rediscovering them selves and their human potentional, The Universe provides us with  everything, wejust  have to get out of your own way.  It is a steping stone to read and learn a new path of life.
0385522401|5.0|The Stern Librarian read an excerpt from this novel when it was published in the New Yorker several months ago, and wondered how Ian McEwan would ever forge an Ian McEwan novel by vividly describing a dull honeymoon.  But he has done it.  In the magazine excerpt, I noticed only the comedy in the situation of a couple in the early 1960's, on the first night of their honeymoon, contemplating the consummation that lay ahead of them over a dinner of pre-Gordon Ramsey British cuisine.  Improbably, however, the novel is something of a page turner, which delivers a stunning ending.  Tick off all the things you expect from McEwan--a dash of politics, a pervasive aura of menace, some melodramatic back story, class conflict, all can be found here.  For the groom in this novel, the sacrament of marriage, the mutual promise, is a concession to society that will result in absolute freedom with his wife.  For the bride, marriage offers a veil of privacy over more revolutionary types of freedom.   I spent four hours reading this book, and many more hours thinking about issues it raises about what marriage is, should be and for whom.  The Stern Librarian (I can recommend some good books to take on your honeymoon).
B000PKG7TI|5.0|This is it. The last Nightwish concert with Tarja. Includes 2 CDS and 1 DVD. A real deal considering the $17.99 pre-order. A steal. I guess it was going to happen sooner or later with Tarja having two careers. I don't think her career will be the same after Nightwish. She sings opera and I own a lot of it and she doesn't have the voice to be a front line opera singer. I don't think either side will be the same in this breakup. Sad to see it end this way. This concert and CD set is our last great memory of them.FIN!!!
0385732554|1.0|I liked it better the first time I read it, when it was called Anthem (by Ayn Rand).
1857152743|4.0|After seeing the play \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" performed at my school, I decided to get the novel (or novella) and read the original.  Needless to say I enjoyed the story greatly and find it to be one of the better stories in this collection.    The other stories, however, are good.  Not great when compared to \\"Brodie\\" but they could stand well on their own.  For the price of this collection you would be doing your collection justice since Sparks is one of the best Contemporary writers and \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" is a captivating and original story.      Also, the introduction by Frank Kermode is a nice preface to each of the stories which contextualizes them well in Spark's life and to the time in which the stories were written.
0596527055|3.0|There is little in this book that is new.  These topics have been written about over and over.  It doesn't even include any surprising \\"myths\\" to make it clever. He is entertaining to read in parts because he tells some nice historical stories, but after awhile you ask, \\"Where's the beef?\\" I supose if you are new to the idea of innovation this book might have some value for you.  But mostly, when you are done, you will understand little more about innovation than when you started.  What is perverse is that after he shoots down an obvious myth (innovation done by a single individual) he gets all confused about the differences between innovation and invention. He is also another, in a long list of authors (think Tom Peters), who want to make the process of innovation seem like a random miracle.  This is a myth.  Yes there is risk, but there are things you can do to mitigate it.  For proof go ask GM about Toyota.  In earlier times, think about all the innovations that Edison produced.  Hey, look at Apple for a modern example.  Have you bought your iPhone yet? Do you really think that the success Steve Jobs is having is because of luck?
B00001OH7P|5.0|I love David Bowie and could listen to \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\\" over-and-over.  The poetics of Bowie's lyrics and the phenomenal guitar riffs hold this album together and are what makes it a classic, must have album.  This is Bowie at his height of fame and truly captures Bowie's glam rock side of the late 1970s.  I could not choose a favorite song from this album because, to me, each song builds off of one another like a good concept album should.  From the opening of \\"Five Years\\" right to the end \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\\" shows the various levels of Bowie's artistic ability.    This is a must have for any serious collection of Bowie and for anyone interested in good, wholesome rock showcasing one of the best artists of the 1970s.
1594200823|5.0|There is a plethora of detailed reviews regarding the merits of this outstanding, extraordinary book, so there is no need to repeat what has been said. Let me, then, add just a brief note on the subject that may be somewhat off the beaten track of most other reviews, a remark that comes from my \\"teaching\\" perspective.     The book is a fine example of how to approach a wide topic, narrow it down, ask intelligent questions, plan and conduct field research, complement it with an in-depth summary of published materials, and wind up with a text that is not only brilliant in its informative content, but also very readable - no mean feat. Over the last couple of years, the only other non-fiction book I enjoyed that much, was Jared Diamond's Pulitzer-winning \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel...\\"
0307275639|5.0|We should all read this book at least once as it shares life's most important lessons.  It reminds us to focus on the relationships we have and not what we own or how much we can make, because in the end, none of those things matter.  We need to appreciate the family and friends surrounding us and enjoy nature's beauty.
1932100660|2.0|Before ordering and reading TCS, I had already been near-vegan for five years, the only animal products I consumed having been an occasional can of sardines. I knew what Campbell preached to be true because all the experts had been telling us this for years: eat more grains, fruits, vegetables, avoid animal foods, and eat a low-fat diet. When I read TCS it simply confirmed what I knew to be already true.    Then I had the courage to step out of my box and order and read Anthony Colpo's \\"The Great Cholesterol Con\\". When I initially saw Colpo's website, I thought he was a nutcase lunatic pedaling junk-science. After all, I had always thought low-carb diets were faddish and dangerous. I now have every reason to believe Campbell's and all other vegans' advice on nutrition is dead wrong. If Campbell's and Colpo's books were on trial, Colpo would win unanimously. And this opinion comes from a very unbiased, extremely well-educated person who has spent many years becoming informed and enlightened on nutrition.    I do not intend to give Dr. Campbell any disrespect (like some others who have slammed \\"The China Study\\"), but simply want to inform the potential buyer that there exists a whole host of legitimate doctors and scientists who have never believed the lipid hypothesis and that animal products \\"per se\\" are not what has made Americans fat and diseased. The culprits are at least a dozen other things, as Colpo convincingly shows. Campbell does none of this.    If you don't believe me, then order \\"The China Study\\" and \\"The Great Cholesterol Con\\" and put them to trial for yourself. First read TCS then read TGCC, as I did. I am willing to bet many vegans will start eating meat and eggs again.    Cory Hall, Ph.D.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Helen Mirren won the Oscar of her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth for a very good reason. She stripped away all pretense of being a glamorous actress and made QE look like a human. As England rises in resentment over the Palace's lack of response concerning the death of Princess Diana, the Royal Family greet the public response as a passing phase. Just how greatly they misunderstood the public's love of Diana completely escapes them, to the point where every concession is met with greater derision within the walls of the royal confines. \\"Celebrities and homosexuals,\\" sneers Prince Phillip when he hears of the attendees planning on attending Diana's funeral.<br /><br />The focus of \\"The Queen,\\" however, remains Queen Elizabeth. She gains humanity and humility as the movie progresses. She is hard as nails (the car breakdown scene is a hoot), but still feels compassion for a stag that is being hunted on the grounds. (The overbearing allegory of the stag and Diana is a bit much, though.) The prime moment of realization comes from a young girl with flowers in front of Buckingham Palace, and it also emphasizes what a splendid job Mirren did...she conveys so many emotions in just a few expressions and no words.<br /><br />Mention also should be given to Hugh Cromwell, who plays Prince Phillip as a stuffy old coot with a typical out of touch Monarch's snobbery and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Sheen shows Blair transforming from radical modernizer into a fan of the details of royalty very effectively. There is also an interesting moment near the end of the movie when Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that someday the press and the people will inevitably turn on you. While we aren't certain if that conversation ever took place, it seems deliciously prophetic none the less.
1594489505|5.0|I can't remember the last time a book made me cry - this one did. This is a great story -very moving.
B0000009SE|5.0|I recently picked up Waka Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo at a Father's Day Mothers Sale.  These two discs... wow! This is just great fusion music. There's very little humor and satire here - One Shot Deal has great vocals that are sort of weird and, get this, a pedal steel guitar!  Just wonderful playing by quite an assortment of session musicians.<br /><br />I also happen to be a huge Miles Davis fan. Many, many critics and listeners incorrectly credit Miles as the father of jazz-rock fusion.  But to us regular folks, who might wear an occassional python boot or tennis shoe, we know this is not the case.  Zappa invented jazz-rock fusion in 1965.  Miles didn't find it until 1968 with Filles De Kilamanjaro.<br /><br />But I digress... this is fusion music at its finest - not the Chick Corea Return to Forever kind of fusion where virtuosity is displayed for the sake of showing off.  It's just really great music.  Buy it.<br /><br />I personally believe that Zappa's best years as a musician (rather than composer) started with Waka Jawaka and ended with One Size Fits All.  Buy 'em all!
1594489505|5.0|Having devoured The Kite Runner in only two settings, I could not wait to read Hosseini's sophomore effort, and I was not disappointed. He writes with such vivid honesty and emotion. So provocative in his descriptions of subtle exchanges, both spoken and silent, between his well-developed characters. For me, this story gave a face to the horrible war in Afghanistan. Reading this story really made a connection for me. It was no longer a nameless, faceless series of bombs, shootings, and massacres. He shows the results, the effects left upon lives, the heartbreaking loss that war always brings.<br />Hosseini's stories are like that of real life. There are no perfectly happy endings. His are stories of regrets, sadness, strength and hope.
B0002EXH5E|3.0|This album is pop.  Pop metal, yes, but pop.  It wasn't too shocking given the fact that they were becoming more and more commercial with each album, but seeing this label kept me from buying this album for a couple of years.  However, I'm kind of glad that I eventually picked it up.  It's my second least favorite Megadeth album behind \\"The World Needs a Hero\\", but it's not too bad.  The songs are radio-friendly but catchy enough and the album has a decent amount of variety.  Although most of the songs are pop metal, they mix up faster pop metal with slower well-structured songs, one non-metal song (some would say more than one), and even some simple Bon Jovi-ish tracks (minus the classic rock influence).  Some work.  Some don't.  If you've heard the singles \\"Crush 'Em\\" and \\"Breadline\\" then know that these are somewhere around the middle in terms of song quality.<br />My breakdown:<br />1. Insomnia 6/10<br />2. Prince of Darkness 8/10<br />3. Enter the Arena 0/10 [just an intro to \\"Crush 'Em\\"]<br />4. Crush 'Em 5/10<br />5. Breadline 5/10<br />6. The Doctor is Calling 6/10<br />7. I'll Be There 4/10<br />8. Wanderlust 3/10<br />9. Ecstacy 4/10<br />10. Seven 1/10<br />11. Time: the Beginning 7/10 [Great lyrics]<br />12. Time: the End 6/10<br /><br />2 1/2 stars.  The coin came up heads, so I'll round up.<br /><br />For perspective and to know whether you should bother listening to me, here's my ranking of Megadeth's albums from best to worst:<br />Rust in Peace (5 stars)<br />Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? (5 stars)<br />United Abominations (4 1/2 stars - also reviewed)<br />Killing is My Business...And Business is Good (4 1/2 stars)<br />The System Has Failed (4 stars)<br />Countdown to Extinction (4 stars - remixed version also reviewed)<br />So Far, So Good...So What! (4 stars)<br />Youthanasia (3 1/2 stars)<br />Cryptic Writings (3 stars)<br />Risk (2 1/2 stars)<br />The World Needs a Hero (1 1/2 stars)
B00005QGAT|2.0|Why am I giving this Michael Jackson masterpiece only two stars?  I have a serious issue with the remastering -- it's way too bright on my high-end (and otherwise very flat with no tone controls) stereo system.  Who the heck maintained the boosted treble?  I'm sure this would sound great equalized on an AM radio station, but it's hurting my ears.  The sound quality of the original album is remarkably crisp...stinging, in fact.<br /><br />So, this is just a warning for those expecting the remastering to have corrected the riding-the-treble-gain problem.  I recommend those without the usual treble/bass tone controls who still have their hearing avoid this particular release.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|While watching this film I was disgusted, not only was it a blatent rip-off of Thunderball, but they tried to be funny in this movie, which in my opinion they completely failed, if you are thinking about buying this movie, I would rent it first.  This movie may appeal to some, but thank God I saw it on TV, because if I would have bought this movie I would have been even sicker than I was after watching this travesty.  You have me correct this movie made me sick, now all may not feel the same as I, but if you are thinking about buying this movie, and you haven't seen it yet.  I would suggest renting, though if you really like the movie, or you are a completest, Bond fan, well then go for it.  Though in my opinion, this is the worst Bond movie I've seen, especially the worst Sean Connery \\"Bond\\" film I've seen.  Though I must say Kim Basinger was very hot.  So I leave the decision up to you.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Hawks's timely patriotic biopic of this virtually forgotten hero provided Cooper with another seminal role (he won the Oscar, beating out Orson Welles in \\"Citizen Kane\\", among others), and helped to prepare our nation for the next impending world conflict. Prolific character actor Brennan (Oscar-nominated as well) excels as Alvin's plain-spoken pastor, and ing&eacute;nue Leslie makes an adorable love interest. A truly amazing story, unfolding on-screen with Hawks's customary subtlety and skill. Don't forget to salute this Sergeant.
B000I2MRHE|4.0|This is a nice toy, and very innovative.  We bought it for my second child. However, I don't think it sped up any developmental progress in comparison to the first child.  He does have fun on it though and it gives him something to do while I am chasing his older brother around.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|Criticized for satirizing the raging war in Europe on its release in 1942, Lubitsch's clever, spirited, often side-splitting farce doubled as a tribute both to the Polish resistance and, quite ingeniously, to the mighty art of play-acting. Benny is terrifically funny as \\"that great, great actor\\" Joseph Tura, especially playing opposite Sig Rumann (as a Nazi colonel), and a young Robert Stack, the lovestruck lieutenant whose cue to tryst with Maria is the first line of Hamlet's soliloquy. Tragically, this was the feisty Lombard's final screen appearance--and she makes a grand though premature exit under Lubitsch's inspired direction.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|Scanning the other reviews it's obvious that this is a movie that will affect you one way or the other.  I'll avoid the political and social commentary and diatribes in my review.    The acting was exemplary in my opinion.  Portman did a great job (as usual), but I have to tip my hat to the actor who had the task of playing the role of V.  It has to be difficult to use purely gesture and voice inflection to play a part, and he was excellent!  I could imagine the emotions hidden behind the mask.    Yes, the film could be interpreted as being somewhat \\"preachy\\" and portraying a transparent political and/or social agenda, but it makes one think.  It can evoke strong emotion.  To me those are things that can make a movie great.    I could've used less gore in the final battle scene between V and the bad guys though.  Really wasn't necessary.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The quintessential Frank Capra film and a heartwarming holiday treat year in and year out, \\"Life\\" is the ultimate optimistic statement on the value of love, life, and community. Capra's masterful handling of the bittersweet storyline--in which Bailey sacrifices his own dreams to run the family savings-and-loan business and keep his hometown of Bedford Falls out of Potter's greedy paws--is pure Hollywood magic. Reed and Barrymore give exceptional performances, but Stewart, in one of his all-time great roles (a personal favorite), is the dynamic, all-too-human force holding it all together. Revived in the '70s after languishing in copyright limbo, \\"Life\\" is nostalgic and achingly sentimental, but doesn't shrink from portraying the dark side of American life. If \\"Zuzu's petals\\" don't put a lump in your throat, wait till a revivified George finds a special surprise waiting for him back home. Let those tear ducts flow, because \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"
B00003CXPD|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this movie.  At first the N. England accents were really tough for me to hear w/o turning up the volume quite a bit, but then suddenly they were clear.  Don't know if it was the DVD or me.  I've since watched Bell in other movies, and he's incredible.  This movie is extremely heartwarming.  His dad and bro are tough-as-nails coal miners, and Billy likes ballet.  No, he lives for it.  There are people who believe in him that get him through until his family finally come around, and then dad comes around big time.  The ending screwed up the believability factor a bit for me, but all in all very well done.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|George Cukor's pitch-perfect adaptation of Philip Barry's hit play marked a triumphant Hollywood comeback for Kate (having earlier been labeled \\"box-office poison\\" by exhibitors), and an Oscar-winning vehicle for up-and-coming star James Stewart, wonderful as a fish out of water in high society. Though overlooked by the Academy, Grant is every bit as good as the raffish C.K., while Hepburn shines in what may be her signature role. Don't miss Roland Young's hilarious turn as naughty Uncle Willie. Sly and sophisticated, this title stands as one of our finest screen comedies.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Honestly, this movie is beyond horrible.  Normally I'm not one for the whole fantasy genre of films.  The dragon movies of any time are often boring and tedious.  One can tell a movie such as this was based upon a book written by an 18 year old.<br /><br />It's funny how the author has stated he wrote the book because he had read a bunch of fantasy novels and wanted to write one for himself.  So what did he do?  As this film shows: he just took a bit of EVERYTHING and combined them.<br /><br />But, back to the film:<br /><br />The story involves a young boy who is sent a blue dragon egg which he cares for until it hatches.  He then learns he's destined to become a \\"Dragon Rider\\" based upon some mumbo jumbo legend only Jeremy Irons is privy to.<br /><br />So he communicates via telepathy with the horredously blatant CGI dragon which shares the screen with him.  All the while, Jeremy Irons leads him into danger and either whispers or yells each and every line he's given.<br /><br />Meanwhile, John Malkovich apparantely portrays a powerful king who rules the entirle land and desperately wants that dragon dead.  So he enuciates as much as possible, then sends a half albino/half vampire version of Robery Carlyle to defeat Eragon (our hero boy) with magic.<br /><br />And so, a legend is 'born' or something and adventure ensues.  If I sound bitter, it's mostly because I attempted three times to sit through this movie.  I should have taken a hint from my oldest daughter (who adored the book) when she said she fell asleep during the film and never bothered watching it again.<br /><br />So, in essence, the film is vastly improved with Rifftrax.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Peerless Warners director Michael Curtiz creates a diabolical murder yarn. Crawford resuscitated her fading career with the driven Mildred, a part she was born to play. Blyth grates as Veda (hard for her not to), and Scott and Carson each ooze their particular brand of acid as the calculating men in Mildred's life. For a vicarious glimpse into seamy small town intrigue, you can't beat this one. Joan won Oscar.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I think am the one person who LOVED this movie when I saw it! I don't understand why everyone hates it. Sure it isn't THE BEST but it was fun. I liked that the BIG PLAN of the villian was about cosmetics and not some big machine or money it had a \\"GIRLY\\" (I hate it when people say that though) feel to it that most super hero movies don't. It was about make-up, feeling beautiful, standing up for your self, and a little girl power. I say \\"GIVE US A SEQUEL!!!\\"
B000056HE9|5.0|Nominated for Best Film at the 1947 Oscars, Henry Koster's sweet, thoroughly charming \\"Bishop's Wife\\" was a big crowd-pleaser in its day, and has since become one of our more cherished holiday films. Cary Grant was never smoother playing Dudley, the most debonair of angels. Co-starring David Niven and a dazzling Loretta Young as the title character, this joyful, witty film still has something to say about keeping the spirit of Christmas alive all year round.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|I've read some of the delusional, worshipping comments of other's reviews here, and I just think they are all looking at Cream through Rose-tinted glasses. This put-back together band sounds slow,tentative, tired. Jack Bruce looks like they pulled him out of a nursing home to do this. Individually, they can still play, but their cohesion is slow- they are devoid of energy. Just go look at the other DVD, the one from the same place at the end of the 60s, and see the forcefull energy that band fired out there at the end of a comet-like three year run. The before-and-after contrast of 46 years is startling.
B00000DFRS|3.0|It's no classic but it's good enough.<br /><br />My favorites are:<br />It's Not Right But It's Okay<br />I Was Made To Love Him<br />If I Told You That<br /><br />and Until You Come Back.<br /><br />I like the beat to Oh Yes and have grown to like the song. Until You Come Back, written by Babyface himself is also notable. I Was Made To Love Him is good too. It's a very bouncy track. I don't care too much for You'll Never Stand Alone though.<br /><br />3.8 stars. Good CD but I'm sure that one of her earlier releases is better. But if you enjoy R&B, then I fully recommend this CD.
B00000AFFF|4.0|Reading the reviews of 'Painted from Memory' makes for an interesting afternoon.  As I continue my journey through the Elvis Costello catalogue, I thought I'd toss in my two cents.  As someone who thought I was only a fan of his early rock recordings (Aim, Model & Armed Forces), I'm pleasantly surprised to find that I very much enjoy Costello's later forays into other genres.      I initially agreed with comments here that Elvis's voice doesn't seem suited for the material.  However, I quickly did a 180 on that.  I don't know that I can explain it, but somehow his plaintive caterwauling here is compelling in a way that the dulcet crooning of a Michael Buble would not be.    Consistency in quality is a hallmark of 'Painted from Memory'.  There are not just a couple of stand-out cuts; the entire recording is solid.  Everyone who takes the time to sample this unusual offering from Costello and Bacharach will have their own favorites.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a stellar performance by Helen Mirren. The queen is depicted in a favorable light which, no doubt, she deserves. This movie captivated my interest.  The troubles with Princess Diana are  not touched on but that was not the focus of the movie.  What is central and what was quite aptly potrayed was the humanity of this lady and her considerable devotion to her duties as queen and as shepherdess of her realm.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Preminger's crackling courtroom drama makes for a twisty, racy, irresistible film. Stewart is in his element as the dogged Biegler, but junior players Gazzara, Remick and Scott are every bit as good. Gritty atmosphere and a smoky Ellington score (with Duke himself in a rare on-screen appearance) help make this daring, distinctive picture hum.
B000B5XOXY|4.0|I must tell you, for quite some time I did not like this movie. I have been a big fan of the Micheal Keaton movies, as well as the Animated Series of the 90's. This film marked Joel Schumakers first step into the Batman universe, and needless to say, it wasn't nearly as good as either of the Tim Burton films. However, as I watched this a few more times, and got past the \\"Its Schumaker!\\" I realized that even though Schumaker had made some really poor directors choices, there were not nearly as many as in his next Bat film, the one credited with single handedly ruining the franchise, Batman and Robin. Batman Forever, though riddled with campy moments, especially after the appearance of Robin, is still as a whole, a good Batman film. Val Kilmers performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman actually surpasses Micheal Keatons, due to Val's very intense persona and tragedy stricken Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />I would say that the worst part of this movie is how Schumaker portrayed the two main villians, Two-Face and the Riddler. The Riddler, who, in the comics was genius, thinking up crimes so sophisticated, he thought it only fair to leave behind riddles for the Batman to follow, was portrayed here by Jim Carrey, a lukewarm choice in my opinion. The character came off very much more like a Joker than a Riddler, and you'll see what I mean if you watch the film. Nowhere is the intelligent, calm and composed villian I expected.<br />Secondly (ha, a pun worthy of Schumaker) Two-Face, possibly one of the most tragic and deadly of Batman's Rogues Gallery, is portrayed marginally by Tommy Lee Jones. Now, Jones was indeed the perfect person to play this character, and it is really too bad that his performance was limited to nothing more than hired muscle for the Riddler. Schumaker made his biggest mistake there, by not only cramming two villians of large scale like these into one film, but not taking the time to really use Two Face as he should have been done.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Batman still manages to pull of some very good \\"Bat moments\\" ones that you have no choice but to look at and say \\"Wow.\\", in spite of his badly portrayed nemesis's.<br /><br />In short, it isn't as good as Batman(1989), but it is definitely worth the watch, because even through Schumaker's mistakes, you can still see a definite veneer of Batman, pulling through the puns and neon lights.s to pull of some very good \\"Bat moments\\" ones that you have no choice but to look at and say \\"Wow.\\", in spite of his badly portrayed nemesis's.    In short, it isn't as good as Batman(1989), but it is definitely worth the watch, because even through Schumaker's mistakes, you can still see a definite veneer of Batman, pulling through the puns and neon lights.
B0000787FH|2.0|Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.     There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing \\"From Head to Toe\\" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites.
B00005JPQP|3.0|Was it worth the movie admission? No  -- Would I rent it again?  Yes -- Save your money till it comes out on DVD. Entertaining but not worth movie admission cost.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Brando's force-of-nature performance in Kazan's \\"Streetcar\\"--an electrifying mix of brute physicality and smoldering sexuality--made Stanley Kowalski's infamous bellow a permanent part of pop culture and Brando a household name. But the undeniable strength of this film, adapted from the smash Broadway play by Tennessee Williams, is driven as much by the witty, vivid dialogue and ensemble acting as it is the lead actor's Method work. Leigh, Hunter, Karl Malden, Ruby Bond, and Nick Dennis are all terrific, and Alex North's atmospheric jazz score enhances the tense, combustible interplay. Winner of five Oscars, this \\"Streetcar\\" offers an incredible ride.
0385338082|4.0|Cute book.  Up to par with most good chic lit.  Pretty much what you expect, some very funny parts, a decent plott, and a happy ending.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|Without getting too wordy at the expense of leaving something out, let me just say that this concert is an absolute delight. Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon complement one another perfectly - a great matchup of stars who also receive very strong backing by the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin under the baton of Marco Armiliato. If you watch this on a home theater system as opposed to not being able to watch it live, the DTS surround really adds to the impact of these performances, not to mention the excitement that stirs up the audience throughout. Very highly recommended!
B00005JKZ3|2.0|I remember having such high hopes for this movie, but it turned out that the movie trailer had served up all the laughs and the rest of the flick was shockingly dull and un-orginal.  But I get it.  Sequels are hard and Hollywood are usually a greedy lot.  The plot re: returning the Light couldn't have been more campy or paper thin if you tried.  But, and it's a big but, it may have worked a little better for children.  I'm not sure.  I don't have children.  Anyhoot, if you have absolutely nothing to do or you're searching for what NOT to do with a sequel, check this film out.  Otherwise, watch the first movie and then pretend that this one never happened.  Where's a good nuturalizer when you need one?
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Was there ever a better big-screen Santa than Oscar winner Edmund Gwenn? This timeless Christmas fable about an elderly retiree who sets New York a-twitter with his claim to be the sleigh-riding patron saint of the North Pole captures the spirit of the season like few other holiday films. Young Natalie Wood is delightful as the disbelieving girl who, hewing to her mother's urban sophisticate views, thinks the notion of elves and Saint Nick is preposterous. Repeat viewings won't diminish the charming allure or the endearing message of \\"Miracle.\\"
0792839730|5.0|If you're tired of the pieced together, staged stuff we usually (almost always) get, this is for you.  This must be the most expertly directed war film of all time.  The stars we know today as headliners are just in this doing their part as expected; no \\"look at me\\" types.  Well, Ryan O'Neal seems out of place, but he's OK.  This is a keeper.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|one of the best rock albums in a long time right up there with led zeppelin and the velvet underground...Oh Well Oh Well Oh Well !!!
1594489505|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a gifted author, to be sure. It HAS to be daunting to follow a classic like The Kite Runner, but A Thousand Splendid Suns comes close! The characters in this book are less dimensional, and this story is far more predictable than Hosseini's first novel- but it's still a good read. I appreciate the insights into Afghanistan and Muslim life, and found the story compelling. I would recommend it- though not quite as adamantly as The Kite Runner!
1594489505|5.0|Simply put, if you liked Kite Runner you will love Splendid Suns. Add it to your list of books to read in 2007.
B000002IHU|4.0|With just one EP and one full-length album, (1983s \\"RATT\\" and 1984s \\"Out of the Cellar\\") RATT became one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Wasting no time, RATT returned to the studio after a massive world tour and released their second album \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" (1985).<br /><br />RATT's second album pretty much is cut from the same cloth as the debut. It's the same sort of David Lee Roth-era Van Halen meets KISS meets Judas Priest formula that is apparent on \\"Out of the Cellar.\\" Compared to the debut, however, the songs here are not quite as edgy and sound more polished. While \\"Out of the Cellar\\" was sure to have pleased Ozzy and maybe even Metallica fans, \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" seems to be aiming more for the mainstream. This is apparent as RATT goes into power-balled territory with \\"Got me on the Line.\\" Some of the edge and momentum from the debut dwindled somewhat as the lyrics on \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" are far more cliche and cheesy than they were on the debut, i.e., \\"dangerous but worth the risk.\\"<br /><br />Even if \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is slicker then its predecessor, however, it's still a fine album. Much like the debut, RATT's sophomore outing is loaded with great hooks, awesome solos and the song-writing is generally pretty strong. The hit singles on this album, \\"Lay it Down\\" and \\"You're in Love\\" rank among the best of the entire 1980s pop-metal genre. The rest of the album, while not as strong as the non-singles on the debut, is still enjoyable, if not all that memorable.<br /><br />While \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" hasn't aged well, it's still worth owning if you are a fan of 80s hard-rock/metal.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I love this new album from Bon Jovi.  Jon sounds a lot softer than I am used to hearing him, but that is okay with me.  My favorite track is Jon's duet with Leeann Rimes.  \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" is an excellent song about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship between two people.  \\"Summertime\\" is a track about having fun and kicking back with friends.  This is the perfect tune for the summer season.  I love the title track too.  This song is about how life is a journey and an adventure.  \\"Any Other Day\\" is another strong track.  I love Jon's guitar playing and vocals on this song very much.  This song is about getting through the grind of daily life. \\"You Want To Make A Memory\\" and \\"Seat Next To You\\" are two sweet love songs.  I like these tracks very much \\"We Got It Going On\\"  is a nice rock and roll song.  I love the beat of this track very much.  I Love This Town is another good track  Any person who loves their home town can relate to the lyrics of this song.  This CD is very enjoyable to listen to.
0446677450|4.0|This book confirms what many of us who grew up in a blue collar family have learned over a long period of years.  This book gives young people a definite advantage of hearing the \\"other side\\" early in life, before college and while they are still optimistic. It also reinforces the American dream of becoming wealthy in just one generatiion.     This book contains the type of information and attitude that I hope to instill in my grandchildren. It is packed with insight and presents it in an entertaining, easy to read format.
1594489505|5.0|Kite Runner[[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] was fabulous, heart wrenching, raw.  The second novel shines in exactly the same way and in this reader's opinion, it is a better written book.  Hosseini seems to have taken his time and developed the characters in a more personal way.  It is a more visual book and you feel as though you could be in the story.  The plot development is interesting and thought provoking.  Hosseini also has a nice way of slipping a good bit of history into the story. I read this book in one day.<br />It is a story of love and sacrifice, courage and loss.  But you can read the synopsis for yourself.<br />I came away from this book realizing how lucky I am to have never know the hardships that come with years of war and turmoil in a country with an unstable government.
1594489505|5.0|Having read The Kite Runner, I was nervous that this second novel by Khaled Hosseini couldn't possibly measure up to his first, however, I  could not have beem more wrong.  I was instantly drawn into the story of these two women.  Hosseini has a remarkable way of getting you inside of his characters.  At times I found my lips quivering and tears streaming down my face, in part due to the life these women were made to endure, and in part because of the magnitude of the bond created between these women, resulting from their gut-wrenching sacrifices and their relentless place in this world.  I absolutely loved the book and even if you are only going to read one book this summer - read this one!
0823016714|4.0|I recently received my copy, and made a few sketches based on some of the pictures that grabbed my attention (there are quite a few). I came to a couple of quick decisions very shortly: 1. The book has enough variation in both models and in each model's facial expressions to easily justify buying the book (as long as you're not interested in doing children's expressions, of which there are none); and 2. The book needs to be spiral-bound. Having to weigh down the pages to keep the book open to the image you're basing a sketch on can get irritating.    One of the nicest things is the author offers a free download of additional images, including a couple of more models, more phonemes, and cloud images, some panoramic, some not.    I've tossed back and forth whether I would prefer color images (the entire book is black and white). One minute I think I would prefer color, the next I'm glad I can focus on the placement of elements in the image with the freedom to add my own color without preconceived ideas. As the artist, you can make your own choice which you prefer, but the book remains in black and white.    Overall, I rated the book 4 stars because of the binding. I believe \\"A Visual Reference for Artists\\" (the book's subtitle) should be easily referred to without having to work to keep the book open.
B000MV9026|4.0|Let me start by saying that I think a lot of you people are analyzing this movie a a little too much.  It is an animated movie about PENGUINS!!! It's not a drama, it's wasn't written by Shakespeare, it is for entertainment. Can we just leave it at that?    As for the good parts, it stepped outside of the typical, Disney-style movie, and instead focused on civilization and art. The penguin, did not fit in because he didn't share their culture (singing) instead, he possessed another form of art (dancing). This was not accepted by the \\"elder penguins\\" because it was different. It was unusual. (And we all know we fear what we do not understand). I loved it because it was centered around jazz, tap, and R&B. Who cares if the songs were not original. They are rarely seen in movies. (When's the last time you saw a jazz musician on Nickolodeon?)    The not-so-good:  The side points were lacking. It seemed like the story fell apart at the end. As if the writers could not find a way to end it. But hey, its a children's movie. So, as long as the guy got the girl, its okay.    Overall:  I liked it because it was centered around an area of our culture that we rarely see anymore. Jazz, Hip Hop, R&B, etc. It introduces our children to areas of American culture that gets shadowed by Pop-driven anthems found on the Disney channel and others in common.  The movie wasn't about saving the penguins at all. It was about the music. The culture. And how, people reject what they do not understand. It seems like everyone who's given this movie a bad review does not understand it. Let's all embrace the TRUE message in this movie.
630587493X|2.0|I've always liked Robin Williams, and I grew up reading Isaac Asimov. That's the problem. I'm sure that if you never read the novella, you really enjoy the movie. But like most people who read the story first, I can't get past the fact that the storyline was butchered for the sake of making the movie. Asimov rarely included romance in his writing, and what little he did wasn't included in Bicentennial Man. Maybe if they just called it something else, or said \\"loosely based on ideas and characters created by Isaac Asimov.\\"    For those of you who have never read Isaac Asimov's original, enjoy this movie. It has special effects and a storyline you don't already know, and one of Robin Williams's better performances. But if you've read the book, don't disappoint yourself.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We have enjoyed the Planet Earth series very much.  When watching it on Discovery Channel it's only shortcoming seemed to be the choppy narration.  That's why we were so glad to find the BBC version which used a narrator with many years experience.  His narration fit seamlessly into the film.  His perfect timing enhanced the action, rather than being a distraction.  It is understandable why the Discovery version chose to use an American voice-over and why they felt were doing the very best thing when they obtained the talent of one of America's finest actresses.  However, narrating documentaries requires different skills than interpreting lines and coordinating them with one's own actions.  Just as in reading for audio books the text needs to flow and sound natural and not sound as if it is being read in increments from a teleprompter.  That is why we felt so lucky to be able to obtain the BBC version with David Attenborough narrating.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I am only on song 10 through my first listen and feel compelled to let the world know how damn friggentastic this new CD is.  One listening through this CD and you to should be convinced that icky must mean \\"kick f'n a$$\\" and that this music IS the Icky Thump!
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I have just recently discovered the world of Dream Theater. Being over the age of 50, I am confident their demographic is a bit younger than myself. That business out of the way, this group impresses me as a blend of Uriah Heep, Metallica and Trans-Siberian Orchestra. There is no question as to the remarkable musical talent that each member of this tight group posesses. In short, they kick..!@#$. I must confess though that I am a bit confused by the miriad of vocal styles on display here and on other albums by DT. The range goes from delicate balladeer to unpleasant screaming like the devil which makes me hit the skip button. As with all DT recordings, the extensive shredding sometimes gets old and after a while sounds like some loud cacophony designed to scare small children and men of the cloth. Don't get me wrong, I like this band and I like this record (I mean disc). There are some great hooks which will surely create some ear worms to last all day long. Songs such as Forsaken possess such hookery and could easily be on the radio. I shudder to think of hearing the Dark Eternal Night following some song by Pink. Would I recommend this album, you bet I would. This was the second album I bought by DT right after Images and Words (which I strongly suggest you start with if you are new to this group). By the way, if you like good drummers then buy this immediately! Mike Portnoy is everything that they say about him. His drumming is the yardstick by which all other drummers should be measured. I am very partial to Neil Peart and Terry Bozzio as well.       As far as the rest of the group, the lead guitar is stellar (maybe could back off of some of the shredding), the bass is air tight and the keyboards are top notch. The vocals are good and bad IMO, but when they are good they are very good. Just buy this and thank Amazon for the samples. Without samples, I would never have discovered this group and would probably be still snapping my fingers to Miles Davis.

B00005JPPL|3.0|The story premise is simple enough, a small-time magician is born with a gift to see into the future albeit two minutes of it to change his life. By accident, his gift is spotted by the Government Agency, which intends to use that as an avenue to track down the whereabouts of the nuclear bombs planted in LA before it's too late.  Furthermore, the terrorists also hunts for him because they want Nicholas' character to be shot before their whereabout is revealed.  As the saying goes, I would be buggered if I do & I would be buggered if I don't.  Thus, Nicholas needs to be a step ahead of them until he comes across Jessica's character that he's enamoured to.  Then, everything become personal.  There are odd light hearted moments such as Nicholas considering his chances of breaking ice with Jesicca's character.  This is an okay movie rather than great because even after the movie concludes, it's actually suggesting more permutations of the future.  The special effects is so-so where we could see what's real and what's not.  Commendable watching for watching's sake.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|When Iron Maiden came together again with Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith for the recording and release of Brave New World in 2000, metalheads around the world held their breath in anticipation.  What they got was a fantastic return to the aggressive, creative song writing that has made Iron Maiden THE gods of the metal world for over 25 years.      Yet despite this brilliant comeback, the band managed to take a slight slide backwards with the follow up, Dance of Death.  Although this record has some incredible moments, it did not contain the consistency and sense of urgency found in Brave New World.      And so once again, the metal world held their breath as Maiden prepared to release their third 'comeback' record, A Matter of Life and Death.  What emerged was not simply a disc worthy of comparison to Brave New World.  Rather Maiden may have released their finest work to date.      To call this album masterful almost sells it short.  Every song stands on its own as a great piece.  Yes, many of the themes are the same that have run through the veins of the Iron Maiden collection since day one.  However, Maiden often demonstrates a more mature, leveled approach.  The Lord of Light is a song about Satan, but not the pitch fork carrying, horns and tail Satan.  Rather, Bruce dares to ask what life must really be like for the fallen one.  Political observation remains a strength with the powerful Greater Good of God and Legacy.      The performances on this disc are impeccable.  The solo on the first track, Different World, is everything we love about Adrian Smith.  The measured, calculated notes are so well crafted you find yourself humming along.  As usual Steve Harris delivers his signature bass sound with great riffs.  He also continues to serve as the songwriting backbone of the band and there is no shortage of Harris masterpieces here.     As usual, the most underrated rock guitar player on the planet, Dave Murray, delivers his creamy, Fender strat sound and ripping solos.  Always brilliant, but never pretentious, Murray always manages to surprise on a track or two. This is saying quite a bit when you consider this is their 14th studio album.  Gers levels just enough restraint to leave you wanting more, but still manages to explode where appropriate.      Bruce shows he still has the pipes to front the greatest metal band of all time.  Moreover, he continues to prove how adept he has become as a songwriter and lyricist.      But the real overachiever here is Nicko.  In the past, Nicko has let the 'prog' rocker side get the better of him, occassionally overdoing it and sacrificing the rythmn.  Not here.  Nicko gives us the stripped down soul punching beats while managing to get in some well syncopated fills.  And the snare drum sound.  As a long time drummer, I salivate every time I hear it.      Plenty of folks have already broken down the album song by song.  However, for any metal fan hiding under a rock who has not picked up this record yet, it is EVERY bit as good as Killers, Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave.  If that doesn't sell you on this disc, you might as well turn in your metal card.  Up the irons!!!!
B00005JPHT|5.0|Love him or hate him, Michael Moore knows how to open dialogues and make us think. Out of all his documentaries, \\"Sicko\\" is probably his most thought provoking. This can be said from both a liberal and conservative perspective; whatever your political beliefs are, whatever your moral standards, I think everyone in America should be required to see this film. A bold thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. Not only does it bring a number of health care-related issues to the surface, it also sheds light on how health care operates in other countries. Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, for example, all rely on a universal system, in which medical services are fully subsidized by the government. In today's day and age, when for-profit American health care shows every sign of collapsing under its own weight, understanding how other western countries look after their sick and injured is very important.<br /><br />When word spread about Moore's new documentary, a number of major pharmaceutical companies ordered their employees to completely avoid him should an interview be requested. For all intents and purposes, Moore managed to get someone's attention. Such is the way with \\"Sicko,\\" a film that can effectively get anyone's attention with its mixture of figures, humor, and heartbreak. Can such tactics be considered manipulative? Yes, they can. But so can news reports and magazine articles and newspaper headlines, all of which we rely on for information. Maybe this is subject matter that requires manipulation, if only for the sake of forcing us out of our comfort zones. As I see it, many problems that have been pushed aside finally need to be addressed.<br /><br />The film's origins date back to early 2006, during which Moore made an on-line reqeust for health care horror stories. He received thousands of e-mails within a week. Some of the more dramatic stories are highlighted at the beginning of the film, such as a man who accidentally sawed off the tips of his left middle and ring fingers. Because he did not have health insurance, he was given two options: have the middle tip reattached for $60,000, or the ring tip for $12,000. The fact that he chose the ring tip isn't the point. For that matter, neither is the fact that he wasn't insured; Moore makes it clear that this film is really about insured Americans who feel that their plans have failed them. Consider a couple forced to move into their daughter's home after a paying a series of medical bills; the husband suffered three heart attacks and the wife was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />With that and other such devastating examples, Moore examines the history of American health care and it's eventual effects. I distinctly remember footage from a 1996 congressional testimony given by guilt stricken Dr. Linda Peeno, formerly a medical reviewer for the health insurer Humana. Nearing tears, she admitted that her job was to save money for the company, not to treat the sick or injured. She then recalls denying medical care for a man in 1987, resulting in his death. Moore also examines connections between lobby groups and political groups. Back in the 1950s, the idea of universal health care was considered Socialist, and therefore un-American. Years later, Hillary Clinton proposed a plan for national health care. It might have happened had she not sold out and accepted campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />The more compelling examples of patient mistreatment are presented near the end of the film. Moore interviews three September 11, 2001 volunteers who have since developed medical problems due to Ground Zero's extreme conditions. The government will not provide them with any medical care; they're not firefighters, and therefore, they're not government employees. The prisoners held on Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, have complete medical coverage. In response to this, Moore escorts the volunteers to Guantanamo Bay via boat, stating that America's heroes should be given the same medical treatment as America's enemies.<br /><br />But out of all the stories presented, this one is by far the most interesting. Jim Kenefick, designer of an anti-Michael Moore website, was suddenly faced with the possibility of shutting his website down. His wife had become ill, and the cost of her medical bills exceeded the amount he spent on web development. In desperation, he pleaded for help by posting an on-line request for money (\\"In Need of a Christmas Miracle!\\" was its title). Moore anonymously sent him a check for $12,000 in what was surely one of the most selfless acts of generosity ever. The medical bills were paid. The website continues to run. I think Mr. Kenefick owes it to himself to see \\"Sicko\\"; his First Amendment right to bash Moore is openly defended.<br /><br />Considering everything I've said, I feel it necessary to explain a few things. My intention in writing this review is not to change anyone's mind about American health care, and while I personally agree with Michael Moore's position, I'm not asking anyone to do the same. I want people to see \\"Sicko\\" only because it reintroduces an important issue, and important issues should always be discussed.ame medical treatment as America's enemies.

B000059GEH|5.0|The title of the movie says it all; it is not exactly the movie a modern day feminist would like to see; then again it stars some of greatest women of Hollywood. The main attraction of the movie are; Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall), Pola Debevoise (Marilyn Monroe), and Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable). This romantic comedy is set in Manhattan about three women who team up with an elaborate scheme to lure wealthy men with an intention to marry them. They rent a penthouse, sell the furniture that doesn't belong to them, and use the funds to support themselves. Schatze is the team leader who is smart and all brains; other two are ditsy blondes. Schatze has her eyes set on an elderly, charming and wealthy widower J.D. Hanley (William Powell), at the same time ignores the advances of a young man by the name of Tom Brookman (Cameron Mitchell) whom she thinks is a poor \\"gas pump jockey.\\" The three ladies meet men of their dreams; the gold digger's plans go awry when the two blondes fall in love with men who are poor, and they desperately try to stop each other from marrying the wrong men. At the end the two blondes end up marrying these men in the name of love. Schatze hits the jackpot; when Hanley offers to marry her; she has a change of heart, and she finds that she will be marrying Tom who is not poor as she always suspected, but a millionaire. Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable deliver the best performances of their careers as \\"desperate women,\\" but Lauren Bacall is a clincher, and most impressive in the number one spot. This movie was directed by Jean Negulesco, who also directed movies such as, Johnny Belinda (1948), Best of Everything (1959), Titanic (1953), and The Rains of Ranchipur (1955). This movie was produced and written by Nunnally Johnson who wrote successful movies such as, The Dirty Dozen (1967), Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962), and Jesse James (1939).
B000PATZQK|5.0|Many bands (the Beatles, the Beach Boys) at least dabbled in psychedelica, but the Zombies are often overlooked. For the 30th anniversary of \\"Odessey and Oracles,\\" the Zombies' best album was rereleased in a new form, proving that their enchanting psychedelic pop has aged exceeedingly well.<br /><br />The Zombies were unusually good at taking perky, sweet, lush music and wrapping it around a more serious song, such as the upbeat \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (guy writing to his jailed girlfriend), or the lovely \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" a poignant little song that tells of a lonely woman doomed to stay lonely. \\"And as the years go by/she will grow old and die/The roses in her garden fade away/Not one left for her grave...\\"<br /><br />But the Zombies aren't all sadness wrapped in happy music. There are perky songs about being happy in love, losing a love and hoping she'll return, and reminiscing about \\"golden days and golden summer nights.\\" The album ends on a reassuring note with the laid-back \\"Time of the Season,\\" which sounds like the ultimate hippie anthem.<br /><br />I have no memories of the 60s, since I was only born in the eighties. But \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" gives a rosy glow to that era,. Psychedelic flair minus the hazy, and every song is a gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" was the sleeper hit from the album, it's not the best or catchiest song on here -- it's just one of many excellent ones.<br /><br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter. He was able to create atmospheric and beautiful songs with very simple writing (\\"Brief candles in her mind/bright and tiny gems of memory\\"). Perhaps his finest moment here is \\"I knew he when summer was her crown/and autumn sad/how brown her eyes,\\" as a kick-off to a colorful look at a woman compared to all the seasons.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone's vocals were well-suited to the music: a bit husky, quite pleasant and mellow. The music itself was generally based on guitar, gentle drums, pretty piano, and wavering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music. Some is almost classical in tone, some is uptempo stuff that is perfect for the radio.<br /><br />The Zombies were in peak form in \\"Odessey and Oracle,\\" churning out some of the purest pop music ever.

1582701709|4.0|Well, let's start from the very beginning. The concepts explained in the book come mainly from New thought movements (Unity churches, Science of mind and similar); so the \\"secret\\" is not really a secret; because the modern concept of the law of attraction originated decades ago in the United States (Ernest Holmes was one of the pioneers of these ideas).     Many eastern teachings are based upon the same concepts and also in the New Testament we find more than one reference to the power of belief. The title of the book was surely conceived in order to attract people's attention and curiosity; my opinion is that this idea has proven a profitable one, because people who are not familiar with New thought ideas have probably thought that what is written in the book is really \\"a secret\\" revealed :-)    People with a certain religious background may be in distress at accepting and understanding these concepts, because in their mind there is a basic concept stating that God is a cosmic person (or a cosmic entity) who decides what happens to people. Their reaction to New Thought ideas (which are based upon different opinions) is fully understandable.    The book, anyhow, does not have a spiritual matrix in any way and contains only techniques and suggestions useful for putting the laws of attraction at work. In my opinion, if we get the book for what it is (a simple manual), it is a good book. It may be worth to read.
0439813786|5.0|There really is not much more that I can say about this book except that it was one of the most amazing reading experiences that I have had the pleasure of enjoying. A moving, amazing tale of grief, struggle and love. The illustrations and words combine to make a unique and wonderful reading experience. I recommend this to all, child and adult and think that this book really lends itself to being read out loud, with younger/beginning readers. To Mr. Selznick, Bravo and Thank you.
0060776579|4.0|The guy had me laughing all the way to Aspen, Colorado.  He repeats much of the same stuff I've read over and over.  But, he does it in such an entertaining way that I remember his phrases and say them back to myself in certain situations.    In this day and age of historically low savings rates and high consumer debt, it's a great book for young people to read.  We do need to be careful not to become overzealous with our obsession with money and keep things in perspective, however.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|This is a difficult movie to rate for me because I'm a huge fan of Beethoven's music and I have researched his life and compositions extensively.  First, it certainly is worth viewing just because it's about Beethoven but there are a number of scenes that will leave the purists hurling objects at the screen.  I mean someone, anyone, correcting Beethoven's music!  There's a thunderclap!  Beethoven's music has a frugality of content that belies the rich sounds and metaphors it invokes.  It contains a sort of musical minimalism and structural form that retains only that which is absolutely necessary.  His music is generally made from molecular bits of sound, carefully crafted and shaped to yield an incredible tapestry of sound with tremendous structural unity.    With this in mind, when Anna Holtz corrected the Ninth, I nearly fell off my chair (well, when she showed up as his assistant I was already mystified). Beethoven would've tore her to pieces if she had dared question a note much less correct him.  He did not take any meddling in his music kindly; even things as trivial as a listener's lack of attention would enrage him.    The scene with Anna Holtz helping Beethoven conduct the Ninth was not nearly as painful though it was utterly fictional. It helped in terms of an emotional underpinning for the movie.  In reality, Beethoven was still conducting when the orchestra had finished performing since he could not tell they had finished (his hearing loss was nearly complete at this point).    The movie does convey his contempt for flattery, his epic rudeness and his radical departure from the norms of composition during his time.  On the whole, I really liked the performances of the cast and, undoubtedly, the tremendous music.  On balance, definitely worth a spin though not without gaping flaws and glaring historical inaccuracies.
1582701709|1.0|This book was given to me as a gift on father's day. I started reading it the way I read any book but soon I started reading faster and faster, more like scanning, with speed-reading techniques, and finished it in 2 hours, while taking notes at the same time.    I have no interest in self-help books or concepts like power of positive thinking. This book combines the two, with the main thesis being that the \\"secret\\" to anything in life, wealth, health, success, love, romance, happiness is positive thinking, thinking positive thoughts. More specifically, imagining things that you want to have and really, truly believe that you already have them, and feel good about having them now!    For example, if you want to be rich, you should first imagine that you are already rich; second, you should really believe that you are already rich; and third you should feel yourself in a rich life style, feel happy about it. If you keep doing this for awhile, miraculously the doors of wealth will open to you, all the opportunities will line up at your door and you will be well into your way to becoming that rich person you are imagining. Similarly, if you want to loose weight, you should imagine yourself in your ideal weight, really focus on that, only allow yourself \\"thin thoughts\\" and avoid \\"fat thoughts\\", and you will get thin. I quote; \\"if someone is overweight, it came from thinking fat thoughts\\". Another one; \\"Food cannot cause you to put on weight, unless you think it can.\\"     I felt like putting a smiley face right after the last sentence as I am smiling now, and was smiling throughout the book. All you have to do is just ask (oh, and believe, and feel) for the thing you want and lo and behold, thou shalt have it! I quote: \\"Make a command to the Universe. Let the Universe know what you want. The universe responds to your thoughts.\\" Another one: \\"The Universe will start to rearrange itself to make it happen for you.\\" Really? I didn't know the entire universe cared so much about me!     The method even works for some frivolous things. Like always finding a parking spot, never having to wait in lines, never being late etc. And a lot of people are, allegedly, already doing it: \\"We have received thousands of accounts of The Secret being used to bring about large sums of money and unexpected checks in the mail. People have used the secret to manifest their perfect homes, life partners, cars, jobs, and promotions, with many accounts of businesses being transformed within days of applying The Secret.\\"    One look at the titles of the co-authors of the book says a lot: Metaphysician, moneymaking expert (ha?), healer, life coach, law of attraction specialist, feng shui consultant (sure)... How about gullibility specialist, swindling expert, or snake-oil salesman?    Actually I shouldn't be so hard. At least one person, the main author of the book made her wishes come true. In the foreword of the book, and elsewhere inside, she says that she was going through a very bad time, her company of 10 years was about to be history. In desperation she looked everywhere for answers and that's how she discovered \\"the secret\\". Judging from the success of the book and the film, it must have worked for her. I suppose she must have thought, believed, and felt something like this: \\"I want a large number of credulous people to buy what I am saying (and the book, and the dvd) so I can make a lot of money\\".
B000OYC3J8|5.0|As a child of the 80s, yet a 60s and 70s Rock fan I can say that the Stripes are leagues ahead of their peers in what they are doing with their sound.  Very few bands (I.E. the Beatles, Led Zepplin) produce albums where I consistently listen to EVERY album. What makes them unique?  First they obviously touch the roots of rock and roll by leaning on the blues a bit.  Second, they take the blues and craft songs around the styles and make them their own.  The White Stripes have been very successful for six albums in continuing to reinvent and invigorate their style of music without forgetting these roots.  While the Stripes have nowhere near the sales of the aforementioned or others at this time, 20 years down the road who will be one of the legends of this time?  My bet is on the Stripes.<br /><br />Since everyone else has to do it:  My order:  De Stijl, Icky Thump, Elephant, Get Behind me Satan, White Blood Cells, The White Stripes<br /><br />My early favs:<br /><br />1) Catch Hell Blues--no one really has mentioned this gem in other reviews--but like the under appreciated \\"Red Rain\\" from the last album has an epic feel to it.<br />2)  You Don't Know What Love Is.  Great song. Sounds like a earlier improvement on punk songs like Fell in Love with a Girl, etc.<br />3)  Icky Thump.  Title track continues to rope folks in.<br />4) Rag and Bone.  Great all around deep song.<br />5)  Conquest.  New angle and shows Jack's vocal depth.<br /><br />Get this album if you are a long term fan of the Stripes.  Get this album if you are interested in a great American band whose fame hasn't soured their sound.

Now I am reading it to my great-nephew, age three and a half, who fell instantly in love with it.    He always lets out a little \\"whew!\\" of relief when Mrs Mallard and the ducklings make it through the gates of the Public Gardens.  After about the fourth reading (there were two on that particular day) we went to a little park nearby where he insisted on playing out the story with me,  complete with Mr and Mrs Mallard's dialogue. It is a ritual now.     This is an astonishingly involving book for small children.  There is a practical but manageable level of threat (of traffic, which is very real and genuinely important for three and four year olds) with the assurance of adult help when it is needed, and the constant reassurance that they are being looked after.  And adults can read it forever  without getting bored!
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Wow what a great movie. This film brings you back to the days of the bareknuckled biker films from the 60's and 70's. The cast is great! featurig legends such as Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda, and Sam Elliott.     A lot of people complain about the cheesy dialog and the fact that it feels like your watching a B movie. Some of you should realize that the film was intended to be a \\"B\\" movie, and that is what makes it great.    So sit back and enjoy the ride......

0143038419|4.0|Self help books can be so preachy. but sometimes u want a bit of guidance and help with getting some clarity. gilbert's book is like a wise friend who'd gone through her own walk of fire and is willing to sit back and share her views, w/o pushing any agenda or making u feel bad for your screw-ups. because we all have them. and sometimes we got lost for a bit. and that's ok. gilbert's book is funny, witty and wise and i walk away from each section with a bit of help in my own self-reflection on my own personal path. i recommend this to everyone, but especially to women, who so often get lost in men, families and careers and forget to take care of themselves. it's an EXCELLENT read, very fun, and also a travel book and i highly recommend it.

1881273989|5.0|I had the original book on my wish list for some time, and then I found out about this book.  Later, I saw a friend of mine from church who had a copy, and she said it was wonderful.  So I immediately ordered my own copy.    I was not disappointed.    Seeing these insights led me to realize why it was that I preferred certain activities and certain behaviors in a relationship, and it leads me to explore what another could want from me.  And since this is directed towards single adults, this seemed more applicable to my situation than the original.    Now, a warning to the non-religious.  Yes, this book quotes the Bible frequently.  But instead of doing so with the intention of disguising a religious tract as a self-help book, the author does a masterful job of quoting scripture while staying marvelously on point, and he maintains the focus implicitly promised in the title-helping you improve your relations with others.    If you are a single adult, read this book.  Don't let the religious sprinklings turn you off.  This book is valuable even if you ignore them.
0316067598|5.0|This is one of the best war story books I have ever read--maybe the best. Compelling and honest, I felt the emotion, the brotherhood, the sadness and joy. I admit, I cried many times throughout the book. If you believe in heroes you will love this book.<br /><br />And don't worry my fellow patriots, when you read the occasional negative review complaining about Marcus exposing liberal lunancy, or discounting divine protection, or anything else they might try. Just remember that the pusillanimous among us will always attack true heroes, as the conscience of the coward writhes in agony in the presence of courage.

There were times when I couldn't put the book down and other times when I had to close my eyes to the visual that I received.  It is definitely a book that I would recommend that everyone read.  Read it with your eyes and your heart open.
1400049628|5.0|As a child I watched Jonny Quest. The \\"Curse of Anubis\\" episode, in which a mummy re-animates to exact revenge on grave robbers, was my first introduction to zombies. It also spawned my first nightmare (or, at least, the earliest one I remember).    I thoroughly enjoyed the Zombie Survival Guide--it's well-researched, creative, and moves right along.     We can argue about whether zombies exist, but anyone who has spent time in sales meetings, schoolboard meetings, political debates, or airplanes is likely to believe that the undead do indeed walk the earth. If you've ever had the nagging feeling that people in the room wanted to eat your brain, you know what I mean.      Even if you don't believe that zombies are real, don't you wish they were?
B000000Y27|5.0|I challenge people to turn off the lights, pop this one on, lay down on your bed and really focus and concentrate on that guitar playing of Mr. Montgomery.  You will be mesmerized.  For it's beyond amazing! This is one recording a jazz guitar player doesn't want to miss.  However, any fan of the guitar, no matter what your favorite category of music may be, will still thoroughly enjoy listening to this legend.  The man was arguably the greatest jazz guitarist ever.  He is my personal favorite among many favorites (i.e. Grant Green, Kenny Burrell, Joe Pass, Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, Jim Hall, Pat Metheny, et al... et al...).  Out of all of the many great Wes Montgomery recordings I would put this one, along with \\"Smokin' at the Half Note\\", as my all-time most revered.<br /><br />As Ralph J. Gleason, a very highly respected jazz writer, was quoted as saying in the original liner notes:  \\"He (Montgomery) has the electric quality, that special gift of making whatever he does come alive, that marks the true artist.  He has terrific swing, the ability to build solos dramatically (and) beautifully climax after climax, and everything he plays has a sense of rightness about it.\\"<br /><br />And what really makes this one even extra special is the trio behind Wes, backing him up are - Tommy Flanagan on piano, Percy Heath on bass, and his brother Albert Heath on drums.  The swinging trio plays loose and always in perfect flow, each one of them turning in terrific performances.  This is a definite must own for every fan of jazz out there.  As you can see, the Amazon reviewers have spoken (as of today, this will be review #43) and it is rightfully holding a five-star status.  I can't believe anyone would give this less.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|It really is too bad that a lot of people here are slamming this album as being mediocre or worse.  I personally think that a lot of that is a failur to open one's mind.  I think that if any band is going to be around for a long time, they cannot just keep putting out the same stuff over and over again.  It may please the hardcore fan who wants just more of the same, but it shows no growth on the part of the band making the music.         I admit that the first time I listened to this album I had notions of the first two albums in my head and it was more concentration on listening and comparing.  However, from the 2nd time through and on I have enjoyed this album more than I thought I would.  Tracks 2-7 are downright awesome and if MTV were still relevant at all the video for \\"what I've done\\" would be up there with \\"right here, right now\\" and \\"one\\" as being more than just a video.  The rest of the tracks on the album are not as good as 2-7 but still very good.          I think that what people need to do is imagine these songs blended in with the ones from the last two albums in a live show and they will blend just fine.  It will not be like when Guns n Roses pulled out the sofas and mood lighting and played unplugged for 30 minutes as an obvious digression from the rest of the show.  I cant wait until they come around here for a live show and I will happily be listening to this album and their others
B000GUJYRE|5.0|I finally listened to every symphony after 2 weeks. I have to say, every performance sounded quite prestine. I especially enjoyed the 6th and the 9th.<br />I agree with one reviewer in that the first movement of the 5th seemed a tad fast. Honestly thats the only complaint I have of this collection. If you enjoy classical music and appreciate high fidelity music, this is a must have !
B00003CWN3|5.0|`Boy's Don't Cry' is the type of film that will prove it's title wrong, displaying enough emotional despair to make the burliest of men break down in tears.  Recounting the true life story of Teena Brandon, a young woman with a sexual identity crisis that lived her life as Brandon Teena and was eventually raped and murdered in 1993, `Boy's Don't Cry' hits every mark precisely and delivers one of the most well proportioned films in recent years.  Director Kimberly Pierce masterfully achieves accuracy and authenticity with levels of unique elegance and sets a mood that is piercingly calm while subtly unnerving.  Watching this young woman's life slowly spiral out of control is so tempered and paced that it almost creeps up on you despite the fact that it's been unraveling quite rapidly before your very eyes.<br /><br />The heart and soul behind this tragic retelling is that of Hilary Swank who delivers a brilliant breakout performance in which she disappears within the skin of Teena or better yet Brandon and completely convinces the audience of her lies, deceiving us as much as she's deceiving her fellow cast mates.  Swanks performance is so brutally convincing that the viewer is swallowed in her frustration, her pain and her confusion.  We are completely attached to her and never want to let her go.  Swank is not alone though for the entire supporting cast is spot on as well, most notably Chloe Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard who command their scenes and our emotions.  Chloe plays Lana, Brandon's love interest.  Her innocence and naivety makes her understandable, but it's her compassion in the heat of crashing hope that makes her lovable and sympathetic.  I wept almost more for her character than that of Swank herself.  Sarsgaard's character John evokes in us a drastically different emotional response.  John, Lana's ex-boyfriend and Brandon's supposed friend is unsympathetic, irrational, violent and controlling and as we watch Peter Sarsgaard create and manipulate his own performance we're forced to appreciate his genius.  His performance is utterly flawless.<br /><br />As Teena's story is told we are brought to an understanding and or appreciation for the lives and or trials of others.  Teena is not much different than the rest of us, a confused young girl who did all that she could to be who she knew she was regardless of the gender card she was dealt.  We all struggle in our own ways to become the person we know we are yet never are given to opportunity to unveil and so watching her determined struggle should give us all a sense of respect for this brave young woman.  As tragic as this biopic is it's a film that we should all experience and learn from.<br /><br />Watching Swank, Sevigny and Sarsgaard chew up their performances before our eyes is fascinating to watch, three young actors devouring these characters with a mature fervor that is hard pressed to find in some of our more advanced and experienced actors.  Swank earned the Oscar she won for this and Sevigny, as much as I adored Jolie in her respective film, deserved the Oscar as well for her heartbreaking performance.  The fact that Peter Sarsgaard was snubbed altogether of a nomination is enough to make me cry so I won't talk of that too much.  `Boy's Don't Cry' is a masterpiece of a film, one that will break your heart and crush your spirits but in the end amaze and move you beyond words.rmance we're forced to appreciate his genius.

B000MV90IU|3.0|Well, I read reviews online before I got this and they said that it was not much of an improvement, but I wanted to replace my DVD's with BD's, so I got it anyway.      There is an imrpovement, but it is from the HD technology and not because there are improvements.  Obviously, the colors are more accurate, the sound better and there are some HD elements, but overall - it looks not much better than the DVD SE on an UP-CONVERT DVD player!    There is a lot of grain and some out of focus moments, but I guess that is how it is in movie making.  THe sad part is, this is the restored version that was on the SE DVD which was prepared for HD as is the case with nearly all DVD's today, which is why DVD's look better now.      My gripe is that there is no surround sound.  I expect surround sound and everything video to be in HD on every disc.  In the furtue I am sure that wil be the case, but you can skip this one if you have the SE DVD as this offers nothing new except being on one disc.  It IS an improvement, but not by much.  If you have BD, I know you will get it anyway...
B00005JOFQ|5.0|`Brokeback Mountain' will stand the tests of time, for that I'm certain.  Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.<br /><br />The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.<br /><br />The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.gh her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.  <br />  <br />Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I saw this movie on a very large screen and in a stadium seating theatre. This helped me to really enjoy the experience. For you see this is NOT a movie to watch, but a movie to LOOK at.  To look at like you would look at works of art.  The color is the first thing that catches the eye. The different shades of brown seem to turn the actors into paintings.  You find yourself noticing the curve of a mussle or the shape of a [...].  The lack of red as in blood is not missed.  The battle scenes take on artistic beauty and you look for the details around the edges of the frame.  The gore of battle is a strange thing here.  The beheading is not horrible, but for some strange and weird reason you watch it noting the slow spraying of the blood and collapse of the head. And it is not upsetting nor grizzly but a work of art.  The dance by the woman is beautiful and it takes you time to notice that she is nude. Is it sexy or porn? No it is flowing and artful.    There is one strange thing that happens after you have seen the movie. I am high school teacher and I found my male students not talking about about the battles nor the women, but spouting the dialoge from the movie.  They heard the words and the message, \\"We are Sparta!\\" rang down the halls of my school.
B000GFLE86|5.0|I've been a Billie Holiday fan for years and had heard of Madeleine Peyroux and that she sounded like Billie, but I never took it seriously. I figured  no way - how can someone sound like Billy Holiday? Well, it turns out Madeline Peyroux can! I've been listening to all of her albums and while this one isn't my favorite (I like \\"Careless Love\\" the best.) It is a good album and I think she is trying to break out a little from the Billie mold here (though just a teensy bit.) Clearly though with all her music she *is* trying to sound like Billie (she's not exactly singing heavy metal is she?) and at first I wasn't sure how I felt about such a perfect imitation. In the end I figured who cares? Might as well stop resisting and enjoy. The fact is this is good music and there are worse things then doing a near perfect impression of one the most famous singers of all time.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang's \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" is a horrifying and gruesome account of the infamous \\"Rape of Nanjing\\" where in less than a two month span from 1937-1938, an estimated 200,000-450,000 captured Chinese civilians and unarmed, surrendering solders were massacred and/or raped in cold blood by the Japanese Military during World War II. It is also about the aftermath of the massacre in a historical sense, and the toll it has had on the victims, historians, and the world, especially Sino-Japanese relations.<br /><br />Chang's writing is intense, emotional, detailed, and thought provoking. Given that her grandparents were from Nanjing and narrowly escaped their own fate from the hell of what happened there, we must read this with an understanding that Chang is inherently biased in her accounts and at times comes off as extremely emotional in her contempt of the Japanese in certain passages.<br /><br />Despite her bias, she desperately tries to stay objective in her accounts, though not always successfully (the passage, even despite the cited references, on Japanese being cannibals of murdered chinese male's genitalia seemed highly questionable and speculative).<br /><br />Chang makes strides in her discussion of historiology by pointing out the cancer of how history is manipulated by politics, government intervention, propaganda, radical Conservatism/Liberalism, diplomacy and political events. Because of the \\"Cold War\\", \\"Sino-Japanese relations\\", WWII itself\\" and \\"US-Japanese allegiances\\", the events of Nanjing have been eerily and perhaps permanently distorted at the expense of 100's of thousands of innocent victims.<br /><br />The book is well organized and informative although I question her premise which nearly implies that American society and that even Japanese society is ignorant of the events that occurred in Nanjing in 1937-1938. In her premise for writing the book, she attempts to imply that there was nearly no literary English reference to the Rape of Nanjing and provided only two literary accounts in English (both written 50 years after the \\"Rape\\") of this massacre. However, she failed to site the well documented account of this Massacre in the famous military television documentary seen by millions of Americans and Europeans in the 1970s, \\"The World at War\\" where Sir Laurence Olivier made a very clear historical historical reference while footage was shown of the massacre including General Matsui's march on horse through the streets of Nanjing and footage of tied Chinese captives murdered execution style while on their knees and hands tied behind their backs:<br /><br />\\"It was here that Nanking in December 1937 that the Japanese perpetrated what was until then, one of the worst atrocities of this century when their troops massacred more than 200,000 Chinese in cold blood.<br /><br />There is also a minor question statistic she references with respect to the number of Americans killed in the Korean ar which she noted 34,000. In Washington DC, the memorial noted over 54,000 Americans dead. But, to Chang's credit, as I've learned in this book, accounting for the number of dead is never an absolute accuracy. For example, is a person dying of a disease or out of accident during war considered having been killed in a war? That's highly subjective. An American bias would count that death as a casualty of war whereby Pro Chinese or North Korean source might not accounts for that death. Both have case to include or exclude that number from the number of casualties.<br /><br />The most interesting passages relate to Chang's discussion of the acts of humanity during this catastrophe, specifically of the spectacular irony of how John Rabe, an educated German who even held a strong Nazi fervor (the Nazi's were allies of Japan during the war) was responsible for saving the lives of over 300,000 Chinese by setting up a miniscule 2.5 square mile safety zone within proximity of where the Rape and Massacre happened.<br /><br />My favorite passage in this entire book was on her research of what happened to John Rabe after he left Nanjing. It was beautifully written and had me reading copiously to find her resolution on what happened to this \\"Schindler of Nanjing.\\"<br /><br />Poignant also was her research on the outcomes of other European and Americans who were in Nanjing during the siege and how politics ostracized these heros whose humanitarian efforts went unnoticed.<br /><br />In her introduction, Iris Chang mused that her \\"greatest hope is that this book will inspire other authors and historians to investigate the stories of Nanjing\\" and that it will \\"stir the conscience of Japan to accept responsibility for this incident.<br /><br />This book should really inspire the world to skeptically evaluate their own histories with a fine tooth comb given the Japanese Government's attempt to undermine what happened in Nanking.<br /><br />On a side note, this book also inspires me to read more of the Jewish communities who fled Nazi Persecution Europe to live in Shangahi, which had been coincidentally the starting point of Japanese occupation prior to the capture of Nanjing. This book also inspires me to research the horror of the Bataan Death March and of the mass burials that occurred in Hong Kong, other areas of China, the Phillipines and other areas that had been seized by the Imperialist Japanese forces during WWII.was on her research of what happened to John Rabe after he left Nanjing.

B00005JPRT|4.0|I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attract the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over his music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called \\"Falling Slowly\\", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.<br /><br />It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's [[ASIN:B00018D3XW The Commitments]], but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglov&aacute; provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Bj&ouml;rk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in regard to cinematic storylines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously.production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|On their previous release, Get Behind Me Satan, it seemed like Jack White was wanting to try to break away from the chains and restraints that being in a two piece, blues based/guitar based band brings with it. It was an admirable effort, and produced what I consider to be a very good album. However, it seemed as though it alienated and confused many of the band's fans, who had been hoping and expecting Elephant MkII or the like.    Now Jack and Meg return for another go, and this time produce an album that will see many of their fans letting out a sigh of relief as they realise their heros have returned to the sounds and style they are famous for.    The title track shows straight away a return to guitar driven, blues based rock, while at the same time though, the distortion of the guitar echos 'Satan' more than 'Elephant' or 'White Blood Cells'. This opening track does not give you an inkling of what is to follow though.    The White Stripes take you on a wonderful ride through Detroit Rock, Delta Blues, Dylan country, american folk, British Cream, a taste of mexico, and aspects of the highlands. It's baffling how they make it all work, but it does. Wonderfully so. Icky Thump is an incredibly diverse album, creative and exciting, whilst still being as familiar as your old bedroom in your parents place.    Best tracks are Prickley Thorn, Bone Broke, and A martyr for my love for you, which all show just how good a songwriter Jack White is. If you could only listen to one track on the album though, it would be Rags and Bones. Snaking blues riff, pounding drums, and Jack and Meg in a call and response spoken word joust as they tell the story of how they would give people's junk and throw offs a home. You can just hear how much fun they are having, captured beautifully as they joyously shout 'yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!!' in unison to close the song. It's nice to see (or should that be hear?) that after ten long crazy years, Jack and Meg are still having fun playing music.The White Stripes have delivered an album that will keep the majority of their fans very happy, and one that definitely holds it place alongside White Blood Cells and Elephant as one of their best.

0316067598|5.0|I'll preface my comments by saying I have read a lot of the literature about Navy SEALs. I was a member of National Guard Long Range Surveillance Unit (Company F, 425th Infantry {Airborne}LRSU)and find the topic fascinating to this day.     Marcus Luttrell's account of Operation Redwing first came to my attention when the team was reported missing on the news networks when the incident occured. I remember distinctly thinking at the time that this may develop into an incredible story, but a story we may not be likely to ever hear.    Thanks to Luttrell the story is told and told well. This is an instant classic in the already crowded category of books on Navy SEALs. Luttrell's real world account surpasses almost all of the previous SEAL books, fiction and non-fiction, and is the equal of the best of them. The insights are excellent, especially into the current mission of the Naval Special Warfare operator.    I highly recommend \\"Lone Survivor\\".
1594489505|4.0|\\"The Kite Runner\\" was a difficult act to follow and I feel that Khaled Hosseini has done a great job with \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" There are some flaws with this second book, but they are easily overlooked for the enjoyment of story told between the pages.    The story revolves around two Afghani women, Mariam and Laila, and covers a wide range in Afghanistan's history. Mariam is an illegitimate child of a weathly man who grows up to realize that she will never be officially recognized by her father. Laila is the beautiful daughter of struggling parents who hopes to realize the education her father desires for her. Both women come from very different backgrounds. Both women have very different temperments. Yet, these two women will be thrown together during a very turbulent time in history. The resulting story is one of admiration of the human spirit and strength of character and quiet courage.     The plight of women in the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan has been told before. Yet, Khaled Hosseini places his sense of compassion and presence to place the reader in Kabul and in the shoes (or, burqa as it might be?) of these women.     My problem with this book was that, while the plight of these women touched me, I never really connected fully with either of them. And certainly not the way I did with Amir and Hassan in \\"The Kite Runner.\\" Perhaps because, in \\"The Kite Runner\\" Amir is not one dimensional. He is a character that is both good and bad, and there are things the reader can like and intensely dislike about him. Yet, with Mariam and Laila, that seems to be missing. Neither character ever really becomes 2 dimensional. And with that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" becomes more of a novel, whereas \\"The Kite Runner\\" had more of an autobiographical feel. With this novel I knew it was just a story. For me, it didn't have quite the same impact that \\"The Kite Runner\\" did.    However, that doesn't mean I don't think this isn't a great book! I think it is powerful and great read and I look forward to more from Khaled Hosseini. Although the first part of this book was rather put-downable for me, the last half had me engrossed. An absolutely great read!
B000P2A24W|5.0|I was a hair band fan from way back and always loved Bon Jovi.  What I always loved about the Hair Band days was the power ballad.  The power ballad always had the strong hook and most importantly the strong lyrics.  As the hair bands faded, I found what I loved in Country music.  The strong hook and the powerful lyric, has been present in Country music for a long time.  I am not a fan of some of the old time Country, but I am in the newer Country.  Bon Jovi has taken that New Country in this albumn and even taken it further.  This has the same Bon Jovi feel that I have always loved, yet it has that Nashville feel.  I know there have been very personal feelings in the lyrics of this album from what has gone on in Sambora and Bryant's personal lives.  That has just cemented the greatness of this.  \\"A Whole Lot of Leaving Going On\\" totally exemplifies this.  I am still proud of my Hair Band loving roots, and this album shows the growth of not only Bon Jovi as a band, but myself as a person also.  The party anthems are still here, and it is great to have a country flavor to them.  What else could you ask from Bon Jovi?
B00005JPAO|2.0|I had heard great and wonderful things about this movie and about Helen Mirren's performance. I really didn't have very high expectations for this movie - I shouldn't have had any.    The film revolves around the time of Princess Diana's death and the royal family's reaction to it. The movie covers the span of about one week, though I think the director tried to do it in real time. This movie is just far, far too long for the material covered. How long and how many times must the audience be subjected to Blair stating Queen must \\"do something\\" publically, Queen refuses, Blair again states Queen should \\"do something publically, Queen refuses, ad nauseum? And, in between, we are once again shown the same old tired film clips of Diana from years before. Dull, dull, dull!    As for acting? What acting might that be? I've heard wonderful things about Helen Mirren dipicting Queen Elizabeth II, but I just didn't see it. She played the Queen as the same stereotypical, dowdy, dry monarch that many perceive. Although many kudos to the hair and makeup team - they did excel, but an actress has no control over that. Mirren captured none of Queen Elizabeth II's grace, sense of duty, true love for her nation and people, and - most important - her wry sense of humor. Mirren simply played a dowdy old woman.    As for Sheen? I caught none of the spark that is Tony Blair. Rather, all I picked up was a hyperactive puppy, bouncing after important people's coattails and trying to impress the media.     I do have to admit the best line in the movie was delivered when the Queen told Blair upon first meeting that he was her 10th Prime Minister and that her first had been Winston Churchill. The irony is she will soon be facing her 11th Prime Minister. Anyone wonder if she will meet a 12th or 13th?     I'm puzzled by the overwhelming number of 5 star ratings here. I wonder that most people avoided nodding off as I did in more than one spot. Perhaps individuals who absolutly loved Diana? Or thought that the conversations between the royals were \\"real\\" and they got the true story? (As if anyone would actually know?) Simply just for Mirren's performance? (though how one can sit through an absolutely dismal and boring movie for the sake of watching one person's performance is beyond me) All I know is that in my opinion, this movie lived up to none of the hype it was given.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Listening to my CD of Diana Krall, \\"From This Moment On,\\" is so relaxing.  Diana executes her songs with her strong, yet mellow voice.  The \\"back-up\\" band is a great asset to this CD, so between Diana singing and the band playing, you feel like you're \\"In Concert!\\"    Everyone HAS to hear it to believe it!    Mike
1582701709|1.0|Here's the secret:  the author made a lot of dough selling gibberish because the new age mentality can't be bothered with an old age thing like thinking critically.  I hear a lot of villages crying to get their idiots back.  Not since Elizabeth Taylor claimed to be channeling dead people just to stay in the news has there been such a demonstration of mass gullibility.

B000N3SRRC|3.0|In the past Clutch has always stayed just far enough away from southern rock to not be lumped in with those bands.  On this album they cross too far into that category and it becomes their most predictable sounding and bland album to date.      If you are a first time listener to Clutch, skip this album and buy the self titled album 'Clutch', Elephant Riders, or Blast Tyrant.  All three are far better than this.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Casino is a underdog for sure, it did get some awards and whatnot but it did not do as well in the public eye as say Goodfellas.  But enough of that, the movie was well written and Sharon Stone was phenomenal in this true story about a real casino boss Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal, play as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (De Niro). It was Flimed in Las Vegas in front of the (now tore down)Landmark Hotel and flimed in the Riviera. The Flim was based on the Stardust Casino & Hotel(also now tore down). Some great acting all around with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Alan King, and Don Rickles. Not the best, it's almost as good as Goodfellas but still a 5-Star Classic.  (Sorry about Grammar!)

B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko will make you sick (from what you learn), and laugh till your sick (from some great set pieces). Whatever your political stripe, whether you love or despise Michael, the message and info in this film will touch  you. Unlike Farenheit 911, this film is not particularly partisan, though there are a couple quick digs at Bush.  This is a film of fundamental  humanitarian values, that transcends petty political bickering. It speaks to central common denominators of being human. It is more than \\"movie making\\". This is an important film. It is also a dialog that very much needs to happen. And despite the schtik, one can sense a genuine caring  in this movie, a desire to help. More importantly, this film bypasses  most of the pedestrian info that you already know, making some solid,  suprising, and useful points. Sicko is not quite as \\"entertaining\\" as Farenheit 911, but it is none-the-less rich and rewarding, with a  refreshingly healthy dose of humor. An hour into this film, it becomes painfully obvious that the US could easily, in fact, provide full health care for all of it's citizens. A far cry from our health care ranking of 37 in the world. An undeniable case is made. The proposals illuminated are shown to not be pie-in-the-sky ideas or naive pipe-dreams. In classic Moore fashion, he supports his points, and systematically addresses most primary logical arguments that one might pose. Though it is curious that Moore did not touch upon how the pharmaceutical industry is the single largest advertiser in this country, reflecting the prohibitively high cost of meds. But boy, you will never look down your nose at Cuba (or France) again. This is a movie you feel good about having seen. Sicko is REAL family values. Sicko is good for what  ails you. A doctors  appointment worth making. OK, I'm all punned out, but seriously, you will enjoy this film.

0967175429|2.0|This book presents a healing modality that is very interesting though I suspect it cannot be learned only from the book but one has to go to a seminar with an instructor. The editing of the book is very poor, there are practically errors in every single sentence, like someone who was quite illiterate tried to proof-read it, etc. Overall, a good book to read but don't expect to learn ThetaHealing from the book alone.    Update: I attended a seminar in April of 2008 and what I said in the review earlier was confirmed: I learned quite a lot more with an instructor than from reading the book. All the meditative techniques were explained and played quite a lot during the three days of the seminar. More detailed explanations were given for almost everything found in the book. However, as of 2009 I have abandoned this modality (and New Age in general) completely in favor of Pentecostal Christianity as true healing comes only through the anointing with the Holy Spirit, which was sent to us by the Father but received through the Son.

0679722610|4.0|I have just finished reviewing in this space all of Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe detective series. It occurred to me that I might as well review the work of that other exemplar of the modern hard-boiled noir detective story, Dashiell Hammett. Most of those familar with his work know it from Nick Charles of the Thin Man or, more likely, Sam Spade of the immortal Maltese Falcon but Hammett, like Chandler, did not blossom forth with these classics without a grinding apprenticeship in pulp detective fiction. Red Harvest represents Hammett's baptism. This story of an unnamed shamus who moreover works for a detective agency runs against the type we have come to expect from Hammett and Chandler-the independent, no-holds barred character. Have no fear our Continental Op has most of those qualities and the single-mindeness to clean up a rotten crime-dominated town no questions asked. While there is not the plot or character development of Hammett's later work here this is still a good read.    ****    Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective. However, on the way to creating these literary works of art Hammett did journeyman's work at the detective genre in various pulp detective magazines. Moreover, in the beginning he hid his detectives behind the anonymous, although not faceless or without personality average detectives, of a national detective agency (shades of his own past).    The unnamed universal Continental Operative (Op) who is the central character of here is the  is the prototype for Hammett's later nameddetectives. He has all the characteristics that mark a noir detective-tough, resourceful, undaunted, and incorruptible with a sense of honor to friend and foe alike that sets him apart from earlier detectives. The plot line here requires all the resourcefulness of the Op as he tries to cleanup a new Western boom town tied together by many a criminal enterprise and the greed (and complicity) of the local bourgeois big shot who let things get out of hand. The twist and turns as Op tries to mix and match with the various interests at play drive the drama of the film. Along the way, of course, just like in the Old West, there plenty of shoot- `em-up action before the town, Personville (aka Poisonville ) is fit for respectable folks to make an honest dollar in. If you want a well-thought out story, although not as memorable as The Maltese Falcon or the The ThinMan, that is also well-written, although without the numerous unforgettable lines of the above-mentioned novels, from a member of the second echelon of the American literary pantheon, this one is for you.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Chances are that not many people are going to agree with me about this, but R&B/Dancehall/Pop singer Rihanna is a fine example of artistic growth. Agreeably, there's virtually nothing original about it -new hairdo, sexed-up image, sexed-up music, slightly cattier attitude, slight expansion in diversity of music, slightly more substance, etc.- but it's not everyday that a R&B/Dancehall/Pop-leaning beauty like Rihanna evolves from an annual one-hit wonder to one of mainstream R&B's most successful artists of the decade. Also, it's especially unusual for that same type of chick to be on her third album after only two years (2005's fresh, Gold-selling \\"Music Of The Sun\\" & 2006's stellar, Platinum-selling \\"A Girl Like Me\\" preceded this effort). And without a doubt, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is her best album to date - something that, if you listen to the whole album, you'll probably agree on.  <br />  <br />All it takes is one glance at the title to know what a significant percentage of this album is focused on - sex. In other words, it's confidently delivered, sexual come-ons delivered over hot, club-ready beats delivered by the likes of Timbaland, Stargate and others. The 80's-tinged R&B/Rock-leaning car-as-sex-kitten metaphor \\"Shut Up & Drive\\" is the finest example of this album's aspect, chucking a sample of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" into a thrillingly chaotic mix of crunching guitar, synth alarms, banging percussion and an 80's tinged bridge that Rihanna delivers her weird sexual innuendo over. And while electro-inflected R&B/Dance-Pop sex romps like \\"Push Up On Me\\" and \\"Don't Stop The Music, which respectively sample Lionel Richie's \\"Running With The Night\\" and Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\", aren't quite as sexually provocative or mentally stimulating, they are both equally infectious. Timbaland's club-bound offerings are equally as infectious - the smouldering club number \\"Sell Me Candy\\" and \\"Lemme Get That\\", where Rihanna rips off Loose-era Nelly Furtado's rapper-ish delivery, playfully demanding materialistic offerings from her man over Timbaland's funky marching band production.  <br />  <br />However, the sexed-up music and image is where much of the predicability ends. Surprisingly, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" explores the album title's aspects beyond the sl*tty club girl image - \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" is a welcome dose of thrilling psychodrama, showing Rihanna letting her vocals bitterly sing, snarl, shout and crazily rip (especially in the bridge) over C. \\"Tricky\\" Stewart's roaring, synthesizer-heavy production as she stresses over a seemingly careless lover; \\"Rehab\\" is a typically emotional ballad that spotlights Rihanna as a victim of heartbreak, lamenting the situation over Timbaland's combination of guitar, piano, tambourine and other instrumentation; \\"Question Existing\\" begins as a faux-pornographic offering, but quickly reforms itself as an emotionally captivating, introspective look into Rihanna's life as a superstar (including a surprisingly touching commentary/talking part); and the title track, driven my mournful horns and a strumming guitar, is as deep as it is cautioning in its attempt to address the consequences of breaking a girl's heart.      <br />  <br />Then there's lead single \\"Umbrella\\", which is easily the best track on the album. C \\"Tricky\\" Stewart creates a Rock-esque sound-bed of hard-hitting percussion, synthesizers, faint guitar and bridge-bound strings and piano as Rihanna croons her ode of undying dedication with more strength and passion than she's ever exposed before. Aside from a disposable Jay-Z cameo, it's as emotional as it is addictive, and is easily one of the best singles of the year.  <br />  <br />What makes \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" such a great album is how well it's constructed - it's catchy, diverse, deep, intelligent, emotional and sexy throughout. Despite the significant creative improvement Rihanna's shown on this album, however, there's still a lack of originality to a certain degree.   <br />  <br />Mainstream intentions aside, listening to Rihanna's music should recall several possible artists and influences - \\"Rehab\\" robs and modifies Justin Timberlake's U.S. #1 smash \\"What Goes Around...\\", while also seeming like an attempt to capitalize on the success of Amy Winehouse and/or her track of the same name; \\"Hate That I Love You\\", a balladic duet with labelmate Ne-Yo, suffers mainly because of Stargate's lazy production, where they pretty much re-use the guitar from Beyonce's smash hit \\"Irreplaceable\\" and the bouncy effects from Ne-Yo's \\"Sexy Love\\" (NB: they produced BOTH of those songs); \\"Lemme Get That\\" reeks of Loose-era Nelly Furtado; and like I said before, the way she's reinvented herself is nothing original (Joss Stone & Ciara are good examples).   <br />  <br />The album itself was said to be influenced by Brandy's \\"Afrodisiac\\", a less addictive but far superior record, but this is more reminiscent of Amerie's \\"Because I Love It\\" in my opinion. Amerie's album isn't nearly as up-tempo, but the sheer ambition, Beyonce comparisons and 80's-music interests Amerie and Rihanna share are hard to miss. Then there's the fact that she co-produced and co-wrote NONE of the material - whether that's good or bad is your decision, but I find that disappointing.  <br />  <br />Nonetheless, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is a solid album, Rihanna's best to date and definitely worth your time. Rihanna is most likely to be the heiress to Beyonce's throne, and although I think that spot belongs to Christina Milian or Teairra Mari, both of the records they're supposed to release this year will have to be REALLY GOOD if they want to top this. Then there's Amerie - I hope she succeeds, but her one piece of filler pretty much made her record fall slightly beneath \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\", but that's another story (read my review of her record).  <br />  <br />Final decision - 5 stars!  <br />  <br />5 Best Tracks (IMO) (In No Order):  <br />\\"Umbrella\\" (feat. Jay-Z)<br />\\"Shut Up & Drive\\"  <br />\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\"  <br />\\"Question Existing\\"  <br />\\"Lemme Get That\\"  <br />
0140177396|4.0|I have mentioned previously in review of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath that he had an ear for the language and circumstances of the drifter, the loner, those who live on the edge in seemingly fabulous California. This is not the California of the Chamber of Commerce hype but it is part of the history of the West Coast nevertheless.  Of Mice and Men is in that same vein although there is probably a little more pathos to the characterizations of Lenny and George than Steinbeck gives to those in Grapes. But the dreams are the same. And why shouldn't they be. It may very well be that the best laid plans of mice and men go awry but, damn, we don't have to like it and what it does to the human spirit. And neither does Steinbeck.  Read this book, read all of Steinbeck's books.
B0002KVULG|4.0|The music is terrific, the actors most of them great, Van Helsing played by Lawrence Olivier is perfect but it is not one of the best films from the novel Dracula.

B000001ESJ|5.0|Farewell is classic Rush. Xanadu is one Rush's best songs of all time. The title track, Farewell to Kings is also outstanding and shows the bands versatility. I would rank this release as a top 5 in the bands long history. My ranking would be Hemispheres and 2112 are 1 and 1A. With Farewell coming in at 3rd or 4th at the worst if youre going to go with Moving Pictures in 3rd. Either way, this is one of Rush's best, and should not be missed by any Rush fan.

B000E1MTZE|5.0|I assume you've already seen the Matrix, and probably love it, and this is the hands-down best version of the trilogy ever released. The quality is simply amazing, even a better remaster than some other HD-DVDs like Serenity. The colors are way more vibrant and the detail is incredible. During the famous lobby action scene I swear you can see every single scrap of tile, speck of dust and individual bullet. You will see details in the background you never knew were there. This is the Matrix at its finest.<br /><br />As a test to the quality, I had the original widescreen DVD and this new HD-DVD playing back-to-back on my Samsung 32\\" LCD. Quickly switching back and forth between formats I could not believe the difference. In comparison, it made the original DVD look like a bootleg VHS copy. I kid you not. Some scenes on HD-DVD look so real its like you are staring out the window. If you don't yet have an HD-DVD player, this is a great first set to pick up with the player and a great movie to show off to friends how good HD-DVD really is.<br /><br />As a note, I bought this version over the \\"Ultimate\\" collection for a few reasons. One being that the Animatrix on the Ultimate edition (along with all the other bonus content) is only in 480p. Since I already own the original Animatrix DVD, theres not much point. The Complete Trilogy still includes a decent amount of bonus features and you can get a free download of the Animatrix if you have an Xbox360. Also, the Complete version has nice looking disc art, while the Ultimate version has blank looking 2-sided discs. If you are the kind of fan that actually wants to watch 12-hours of behind the scenes footage, get the Ultimate. But if you are like me and just want to see the movies in HD then this version is just fine.
1416523359|1.0|I'll skip the plot summary since it's already written elsewhere by much better writers than me, and focus on the book itself. First, this was clearly a novella or long short story that somehow got rounded out into a much larger mess (Even Kings states in the afterward that even his editor used a merciless red pen to the point it had become illegible. I'm not so sure King was exaggerating).<br /><br />If you are planning to buy it and are wondering if you'll ever get back the rewards from reading a good book, the answer is no--IMHO. From the ridiculous characters, artless writing, puerile phrases and made-up words like smucking, bad-gunky, bools, Incunks, blood-bools, and the oft-repeated Jesus, Mary, and JoJo the carpenter (ha ha, get it? there's lots more, and it's a treat), to the glacial pace of plots, subplots, and sub-subplots. Those made-up words are part of the secret language of love between Lisey and Scott (the dead hubby who is a fractured man but who really, really loved his wife). I mean, he smucking loved her. More on that love in a bit.<br /><br />The supporting characters are all sisters (similar to King's real-life extended family--his wife has five sisters, and I guess this is payback? Flattery?), and it's like a freakish gathering of King's female protagonists from past books, but now each is given bit parts (except for one) in varying degrees of plot thickeners (like corn starch, they add zero nutritional value, but you need them for filler). One sister is Dolores Clairborne, another Rose Madder, still another like that mother from Pet Semetery, and well, you get it. If you've read all his books as I have, you will hear each voice clearly, drowning out Lisey's unremarkable character, the pro-angst-onist.<br /><br />Yes, Lisey (pronounced Leecey), has a lot of angst, two years after her spouse's death. And let's be clear: King doesn't create a Father-Knows-Best husband, or even an Al Bundy wannabe. The former wins best Dad of the year, the latter gets the Homer Simpson \\"never try\\" award, but at least each was fun to watch in their day and age.<br /><br />No, our Scott Landon is a selfish lout who comes across as being cuckolded by his very first date with Lisey, only getting worse with marriage.<br />Scott to Lisey: If you marry me, NO children, as they might be born with the bad gunky. (Don't ask, it's even painful writing it here). Doesn't tell her why until her eggs have dried up and it's too late. Nice.<br />She is shown as nothing more than appendage on his book tours, with a silver shovel for luck.<br />He's a drunk. He talks too much and talks at his wife. Even she knows he's a schmuck.<br />He self-mutilates (to do that blood-letting thing which releases the gunky). But he IS a fast healer!<br />And, contrary to the book's title, this is all about Scott, his brother, his upbringing, his father, his everything. The world really did revolve around him. Lisey never had a chance with a catch like him! But the baggage he carried, you might say, should make up for it. Dear God, if everyone with baggage used that excuse, the world would be a very ugly place.<br /><br />The last third of the book is about more gunky, how Scott with ADHD (which they talk about) has planned out this intricate plan to save Lisey's sister, for AFTER he's dead, set her on her own 'scavenger' hunt, and, by golly, get her RC cola when it's all said and done. The only truly interesting plot thread, of the many, is THE STALKER. If he had written a book about a famous novelist's widow dealing with a truly mad fan, and everything else was background noise, I'd give it five stars. Any chapter with the sociopath involved was VINTAGE King. Only he knows how to make a truly terrifying nut job. But alas, this was a minor plot point that he seemed to flesh out when he realized the book was going nowhere after 150 pages. Yes, 150 pages of yawning, boring, non-sequiturs. Even stalker-man seemed bored until he found his talents with a corkscrewand human flesh. And I give King's book a star for that character.<br /><br />If you've read King's books on alternative Universes, Multi-verses, and loved The Talisman, Black House, the entire Gunslinger series, then you'll be in for a shock at how he took a subject he's normally quite adept at and made a mess of things (except for McStalker McCool). I really do love 99% of his books, but this novel (a long short story), is not the kind I looked forward to reading every night. And I base a good book (you can write it in crayon and I wouldn't care) on how quickly I want to drop what I'm doing and get back to reading. Poor Lisey, she deserved so much better from King, the husband, and my attention span. Bool. The End.racter.

B00005JKN9|1.0|I agree with those reviewers who've seen through this movie. Under the period costumes and the periodic bursts of graphic violence, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a set-bound bore. Bad dialogue, worse accents, and a cliched, spaghetti-Western plot. But, Gogol, if you're going to diss \\"Once Upon a TIme in America,\\" as innovative a gangster movie as \\"The Godfather,\\" at least blame the guy who did make it -- Sergio Leone -- not a guy who didn't -- Scorsese.
1577314808|5.0|I have never digested a message with more depth and clarity than the one that drips from every syllable in The Power of Now.  Each paragraph required hours, if not days, of contemplation before I could move on to the next.  I worked (verb not chosen at random) on this book for over a year before completely finishing it.    While his message is religious in the sense that it requires deep  philosophical conviction, its result for me was to actually move me away from the concept of any organized religion and, in fact, more towards atheism.  With an underlying theme that relegates concepts such as \\"faith\\" and \\"guilt\\" to irrelevancy, the message in this book can free the mind and soul in a way previously unknown to me.  And although one could spend a lifetime of devotion to these principles and still not obtain mastery, even a minimal understanding and use in practice will have enormous effects on one's overall level of happiness or, more appropriately, contentment.    Ironically enough, if everyone in the world were exposed to these concepts via Tolle's perfect eloquence, the world we live in might have a remarkable similarity to the \\"heaven\\" that so many formal religions want us to wish for in the future.
B0009MAO46|5.0|TOY STORY is one of those classic movies that should be around for generations. Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear and Cowboy Woody are two of the most lovable and fully developed animated characters ever created.  The movie is hilarious throughout though there are also many poignant moments (like Buzz's \\"I Will Go Sailing No More\\" song).  Many talented actors contributed their voices most notably Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles and the movie includes three memorable songs - \\"You Got a Friend\\", \\"Sailing No More\\"  and Strange Things.  And like all good stories it has some important themes including the meaning and value of friendship.  Nothing scary for the little ones except perhaps some brief scenes of mutated toys and Syd's threatened violence toward Woody.  This is a clever movie with heart that everyone should see.
0590259385|5.0|A friend of my parents gave me this book as a baby shower gift because her son loved it, and after continuously putting away outgrown clothes and toys over the past year, this book has outlasted every other gift!    I've been reading this to my son almost every night since he was born, and he gets a huge grin on his face as soon as I read the first sentence: \\"Is your mama a llama?\\" The story follows a little llama as he asks each of his animal friends this question. The rhyming is creative but has an easy flow as you read, which makes it good for keeping a little one's attention as well as for learning how rhyming works as they get older. The illustrations are colorful and detailed (not just outlines). My son always reached up to touch the orange \\"sun\\" that appears on several pages, so I kept telling him what it was, and now that he's older he will touch it if I ask where the sun is. I can see that this will be a good book to \\"grow into\\" as I read the description of an animal and he can \\"guess\\" what it is before I turn the page.    This book is a very special part of our bedtime ritual. At this rate we'll wear it out before the next child comes, but I definitely plan to buy another copy!
B000002O51|4.0|I only gave \\"Third Stage\\" 4 stars because it's not long enough, darn it!!!  That being said, I absolutely love this album.  I remember buying the tape in [...]and playing it until it had that quavery, metallic sound that, unfortunately, the kids of today will probably never hear.  Ah, nostalgia...<br /><br />Anyway, while listening to \\"Third Stage,\\" I felt like I was experiencing the memories of Tom and Brad and the rest of the Boston guys.  Especially through Hollyann.  Now that I'm getting a little older, I can't help but look back on the days of my youth through, if not rose-colored glasses, at least the watery, smooth and blurred finish of an impressionist painting.  With Hollyann, I can almost see the couple standing proudly, hair flying in the breeze, perhaps watching the setting sun and standing for what they believed so strongly.<br /><br />On the other side, Amanda, To Be a Man and Still In Love seem to be, partly, about the struggle to do right over wrong, to fight for love and for those you love.<br /><br />Beauty, fun, introspection, love, sacrifice...  the stuff of life.  Also, the stuff of \\"Third Stage.\\"  If you like the unique Boston sound, \\"Third Stage\\" is a must-have for your CD case.  Although, I still have my tape!!
B000000OSG|5.0|Both Use Your Illusion albums had enough material for a 4LP set, and most of it is superb.  This is the better of the two records, with G n R classics like Locomotive (an intense, nearly 9 minute rave up), Pretty Beat Up (courtesy of Izzy Stradlin with a cool sitar intro), an excellent cover of Knockin' on Heaven's Door, and Estranged is one of Guns's best ballads.  Gettin' in the Ring is a funny song where Axl goes off on critics.  The song is a bit obvious, but it's still fun to listen to.  Axl may be blatant in telling the titans of rock \\"journalism\\" to go f*** themselves, but Axl has never been one to mince words, and the song is still great.  The immensely insane creativity of these two albums is quite epic and amazing.  Sure, there are a few songs that could have easily been left unreleased (like My World and the alternative version of Don't Cry), but considering the sheer ambition, drive, and intelligence of the Use Your Illusion albums, we can forgive Axl and company.  The great music here is incredible, still fantastic 17 years after it was released.  Sometimes I thought this would be Guns n Roses's final album, as the epic wait for Chinese Democracy was becoming a joke, even though Guns n Roses was performing the songs in concert and there were bootlegs.  Thankfully it wasn't the final album by them.  Use Your Illusion II (and I, Appetite, and GNR Lies) show how really talented and amazing this band is/was, and will be again.
0441172717|5.0|What can you say about Dune? Simply put, I loved this book. The political commentary was on point and reminiscent of colonization: it demonstrated the open exploitation of a people (Fremen) by outside market interests (House Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Guild) and the subsequent rebellion that led to revolutionary decolonization. The book also made a foray into religion, a sort of savage religion, in the tales of Muad'Dib and the prophetic Kwisatz Haderach, and environmentalism popped up with the vision of Liet-Kynes to turn an entire desert community into a lush garden planet.<br /><br />Frank Herbert does an incredible job and is an outstanding story teller who can blend different plot elements and themes under the embrace of science fiction. That is precisely why whenever science fiction is brought up, Dune is always the first book mentioned. It really is an outstanding story.<br /><br />Take it from me, someone who does not generally enjoy science fiction, Dune is just a great book, period. Disregarding all genres and labels, Dune is a solid work of fiction, entirely worth the read.
0743496728|5.0|I loved this book! I read it while on vacation and I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real to me. I am a middle school teacher and I see those characters everyday in my classroom.   The book has haunted me for days and I have recommended it to everyone.
B000003CM9|5.0|I have to admit that my opinion here isn't too objective; mainly because I am an Allman Brothers fan from way back.<br />This was Duane's last album with the Allman Brothers before tragedy struck. Maybe for that reason alone, it deserves a place in any rocker's collection. Duane Allman's slide guitar reaches those high notes, and bro Gregg cooks too. I love those harmonizing guitars.<br />I cannot be even slightly critical of this album, because each and every song delivers the ultimate sound these guys were famous for.<br />Their version of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is a good example of how tight and together they played. I wouldn't have it any other way.<br />I still have the original vinyl album, and don't have the CD yet, but after reading the other reviews here, I know it's probably my next CD purchase for sure.<br />Some music, no matter how much time has passed, just sounds better.
0316010669|3.0|The author begins with the claim that when making decisions, we frequently place too much value on thought and deliberation, rather than intuition (or what he calls, \\"thin slicing.\\"). However, although using our gut feel can sometimes result in brilliant outcomes, at times it can be disastrous. Things like prejudice or even product packaging can interfere. The solution appears to be that one must first become an expert through in-depth study and practice. Further, the environment must be controlled to eliminate prejudice and other factors. Only then can a \\"pure blink\\" moment be created.      I fear that many who don't read the entire book will mistakenly walk away with the idea that their practice of making decisions without doing their homework has been validated, when in fact that is simply not the case. Hopefully not too many have \\"thin sliced\\" the initial concept of this book and have read through to the end to get the full picture.

B000096IBI|5.0|Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936)<br /><br />I've spent the past few decades assiduously overlooking old film comedies, mostly because of my dislike for the contemporary comedy shorts (the Three Stooges, the Little Rascals, et al.). I decided earlier this year that I was going to stop doing that; after all, they can't all be that bad. One of the earliest stops on this new journey of mine was Modern Times, Charlie Chaplin's 1936 extravaganza that makes it into critics' 100-best lists with almost alarming regularity.<br /><br />The basic idea is that Chaplin, a factory worker, and Paulette Goddard, a homeless waif, team up after Chaplin gets laid off when the factory closes (it's the Depression, remember) and try to make their way in the world. This leads both through a succession of jobs (and a rickety homestead), as well as more than one brush with the law.<br /><br />I know there's a great deal of social commentary to be found here; I've read more than enough articles on the film to have missed that. But my mind is a sieve, and I can't remember terribly much about those articles. What I found important, and enjoyable, about the film is that it's a wonderfully-choreographed piece, a remnant of the silent era in the age of talkies (there is very little actual speech in the film), and an excellent showcase for Chaplin's talent for physical comedy. Add to this the eye-popping beauty of Paulette Goddard, a pitch-perfect sense of pace, and an array of sets that rivals most of what gets turned out seventy years later, and you have the recipe for a truly classic film. And Modern Times surely is that. **** ½
1594489505|5.0|A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS begins with a 'harami,' Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a housekeeper and her wealthy employer.  We meet Mariam as a young girl and follow her through her childhood and teenage years, as a series of circumstances turns her idealism to cynicism and ultimately lead her to an unhappy marriage with a man three times her age. It is with her new husband, Rasheed, that Mariam is introduced to a burqa for the first time. It is with Rasheed that Mariam sees her dreams dashed, her hopes for happiness destroyed.    Across the street from Mariam and Rasheed's humble home, Laila is born on the day the Soviets invade Afghanistan.  By her ninth birthday, Laila, the daughter of a professor, is a bright and beautiful girl.  By her fourteenth, Laila is hopelessly in love with her best friend, Tariq.  But before her fifteenth birthday, Laila's life will change drastically.    The lives of Mariam and Laila intertwine irreversibly against a backdrop of three decades of political and social unrest in Afghanistan.  Khaled Hosseini, in a triumphant return after 2003's THE KITE RUNNER, tells the tumultuous history of his country through the eyes of two unforgettable women.  We see a woman's reaction to the Soviet occupation (\\"a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan,\\" as one character puts it), to the strict religious control of the Mujahideen, to the cold brutality of the Taliban. Most of us are aware how patriarchal Afghanistan was until very recently; however, I personally didn't know how bad it truly was for women, how dependent they were on their husbands and other male relatives for the simplest of things.  It's startling, and heartbreaking, and, in this book, sometimes agonizingly cruel.     A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is a brutal and beautiful story, a tragic and an uplifting one.  Hosseini is such a remarkable storyteller, so gifted at picking just the right turn of phrase that makes your breath catch in your throat at its poignancy.  The prose is simpleand lyrical, and the characterizations are incredible.  Laila and Mariam are two of the strongest and most intriguing female characters I think I've ever read.  I was startled at how strongly this book affected me, at the emotions it brought out in me.  I was short of breath one minute, wiping tears from my eyes in the next, cheering for these amazing women throughout.     What this book made me feel most of all was sympathy for the innocents in Afghanistan.  The Soviets occupy the country, and after years of fighting, they're overthrown by the Mujahideen.  Afghanis rejoice.  But then the Mujahideen become power-hungry, start in-fighting, and enforce strict rules -- punishable by death if broken.  When the Taliban arrives and takes power (after more fighting), again Afghanistan rejoices...only to be thrust into a jihad, a holy war, led by cold, calculating leaders who will stop at nothing in the name of religion.  What a heartbreaking history -- how horrible it must have been to live through.    But this isn't a depressing story, not by any means.  There is brightness in the lives of these women, a light that refuses to go out.  This novel is an ode to a country that refused to let a series of oppressive regimes steal its soul. It is a story of sacrifice, of strength, of family, of resiliency, and of love most of all.  It is a story that will inspire you, open your eyes to a perspective generally ignored by a large part of the world.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is a beautiful, beautiful book, the kind you wish would go on forever.  I will not soon forget those women, that suffering, that beauty...or this story.
055358202X|3.0|Well, George did it again! He managed to create a fantasy world that is totally believeable. I have been hooked on \\"Song of Fire and Ice...\\" until this book.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this book wasn't good or a pleasure to read, it really was, I was just missing some of my favorite characters who did not appear at all in this book or appeared exceptionally briefly. In the back of the book Martin explains that in the next book that is soon to come \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" he explains what is going on with the characters that were missing from this book.<br /><br />All that aside, I still had some complaints. This volume was chock full of politics and schemes that never really made it to full bloom, so by the time the book after \\"Dance with Dragons\\" comes out and we get back to the characters that were featured in THIS book I will have forgotten what the schemes were to start with. That, and Martin introduced so many new characters that my head started to spin after awhile.<br /><br />Complaints aside, it was a good book that kept me reading and eagarly awaiting the next enstalment. Definitely worth the read!
B000035Z1Z|3.0|This movie isn't one that I would go to the movies to see, but is worth watching on a rainy afternoon at home. It's cute, and will do in a pinch. I'd buy it again for that purpose.
B000002H6C|4.0|Ok, I saw that there were about 780 or so reviews on this CD.  So, I seriously doubt that I am going to add anything that hasn't already been said before.  <br />  <br />But to let people know, and to give an honest review on this CD, here it goes:  <br />  <br />\\"... And Justice for All\\" is certainly not the best MetallicA CD, but it surely is not the worst either.  <br />  <br />The best MetallicA CDs are \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\".  That is quality Thrash Metal for what it is worth.  Get those 2 CDs, and you pretty much have MetallicA's greatest hits.  (Also, if you really think about it:  Both of those CDs are somewhat MegadetH CDs.  Dave Mustaine wrote 3/4ths of the songs on \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and 1/4th of the songs on \\"Ride the Lightning\\", but he never got credit for it.  *See the inside liner notes in the CD cover of \\"Killing is my Business... and Business is Good\\" re-mastered CD from MegadetH about the whole story on that*).  <br />  <br />My gosh, NOTHING is worse than the \\"Load\\" CD and the \\"Reload\\" CD.  (More like \\"Crapload\\" is what is should have been called).    <br />  <br />Just face it people, MetallicA went straight downhill after Cliff Burton died.  His death was the death of MetallicA as a quality Thrash Metal band.  From almost being just as heavy as early sLaYeR to becoming nothing more than a watered down third rate version of System of a Down.  <br />  <br />The band never got over Cliff's death.  It is obivious.  The song writting quality went straight downhill and the overall Metal in the band started to disappear altogether.  How MetallicA still even has the name Metal in their name now these days I honestly do not know?  They are anything but Metal now.  <br />  <br />That's the overall of the band during the time of this CD.  For the specifics of the CD:  <br />  <br />Has anyone ever noticed that you don't hear not one ounce of Bass on this entire CD?  It is nothing but Rhythm Guitar and Drums, and you just barely hear the Lead Guitar sometimes on the CD.    <br />  <br />It is almost like the band doesn't even have a bassist on this CD, b/c you can't hear him at all on any song on the whole CD.  <br />  <br />Most of the songs on this CD are kick-butt.  \\"Blackened\\", \\"...And Justice for All title song\\", \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"The Shortest Straw\\", \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\", and \\"Dyer's Eve\\".  Those songs there make this CD what it is.  <br />  <br />\\"One\\" has been overplayed to death so much that I could care less if I ever hear that song again.  To me, \\"One\\" is a crap song, the beginning to middle part of it anyways.  The end of it, the heavy part, is not bad at all, but the rest of the song is to be thrown away.  <br />  <br />\\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" starts out pretty cool, but the song ends up going nowhere, and it is easy to just get disinterested in the song altogether.  Nothing much in the song to really hold your interest.  <br />  <br />\\"To Live is to Die\\" (instrumental) is not bad at all for most of the song and is very pretty in some parts.  The beginning, about 4 or 5 minutes into the song, and at the end of the song are very pretty.  The rest of the song just goes nowhere, and becomes bland and is almost like a broken record, playing the same part over and over and over and over again, and never going anywhere.  <br />  <br />Sadly, \\"Dyer's Eve\\" will be the last awesome song this band would ever make.  After that song was over, this band died, and the band as a whole were never anywhere as heavy or this much quality in the music as the first 4 CDs ever again to this day still.  <br />  <br />  <br /> MetallicA  <br />1982 - 1989  <br />   R.I.P.   <br />  <br />  <br />*On a side note:  Most of the songs on this CD sound like the guys are trying to do all out MegadetH, but fall short of it.  I still say that \\"Rust in Peace\\" CD from MegadetH is a million times better than \\"...And Justice for All\\" from the band formely known as MetallicA.  \\"...And Justice for All\\" is not a horribly bad CD at all, but \\"Rust in Peace\\" is so much better.*  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Though not a heart-wrenching love story, The Holiday is a inspiration for the romantic at heart.  It causes room for doubt, then offers hope. It's cute...not too deep but still romantic and playfully pleasant.  I enjoyed it...have watched it twice.  My 15 year old, however, said it was boring and not worth watching.  I attribute that to age and the lack of ability to understand certain innuendos.
B000003CKH|5.0|This album really makes me happy. When I need to get a smile from myself or just about anybody else, I can just put on \\"I Will Survive.\\" Truly, the entire album is big fun. Tons of great lyrics. Great horn. Groovy vocals. Just a really fun album.

B000N6U0E2|4.0|This is your typical rags to riches story.  It lacked the drama I was expecting...considering the hype. Still, it's a good movie and I'd recommend it.
B0000C03AH|3.0|.....maybe.  SACD layer sounds better than CD layer; more spatial information, tighter bass and sweeter strings.    You will experience more sonic improvements, if you own audiophile High-End stereo system.   This set is especially suitable for the people who avoided DG Karajan recordings because of overly bright tonal qualities(Karajan glare).  With this set, you can enjoy Karajan/Berlin PO with decent sound (you still hear thin lower-mid range and upper-mid range harshness   with screechy first violin though).    Is his interpretation of Beethoven's music as profound and convincing as Furtwangler's?    My suggestion to you:  If you want to listen to the best Beethoven cycle, do yourself a favor,  Obtain the 9 symphonies by Furtwangler.
1400063515|4.0|\\"The Black Swans\\" is a fascinating book that amasses a huge and eclectic amount of empirical evidence. I had fun reading it, and I read it all: front cover to backcover. My most favorite sections in descending order were Glossary, Notes, and Bibliography. Such a preference probably identifies me as Mediocristani (citizen of Mediocristan) by nationality. While I'm very glad to know of the existence of a much better-off land called Extremistan, I'm not convinced of the value of changing my citizenship - yet.    What I like about Extremistan is that citizens of this land value the randomness, rarity, and unpredictability of outliers, and the enormous influences that outliers have on the change and growth of everything important. The narrative and anecdotes of the book are amazing. There is really a basis for professional and personal growth here.    Very good books have always had two distinct effects on me. Some books are so good that all I can say is Wow. Others are so good that they make me want to write my own book - for or against. Reading \\"The Black Swans\\" has shown me a third effect that mixes the two. On one hand I'm wowed by the author's reflective and knowledgeable attention to things random and extreme. On the other hand the difference between the Extremistan and \\"Gaussistan\\" outlook on outliers is only a matter of emphasis and detail. It is not that Gaussians do not see the value of outliers (they do!), it is that apparently they understate the importance of outliers.     It is seems like Extremistani have overemphasized their case. The overemphasis leads me to another concern. The book misses the reinforced and mutual interdependence between Mediocristan and Extremistan. According to this book Albert Einstein (both the person and the idea) was a Black Swan - correct. However, as a Black Swan Einstein was not unrelated to his ordinary parentage, for example. Outsiders saw Einstein disassembling Newtonian physics, Einstein himself viewed Newton as a foundation for his new edifice. An outlier, of course; isolated outlier, doubtful.    The book also talks up \\"antiknowledge\\" and \\"antilibrary\\". That kind of talk is incomprehensible given the about of research that went into writing the book as evidenced by the amount of notes and bibliographic materials. What is the purpose of the book? Does the author truly expect his readers to not learn anything from the book? Am I really worse-off for having read this book? In this respect I wished the author followed his own counsel that it is both easier and funner to knock down things than to put them together.    Having said all that, I still recommend this book, with a caviat that it is not antiknowledge and antilibrary; it is pro-knowledge and belongs in libraries.

B000R4SMCW|5.0|This was the best movie ever! I never watch a movie more than once yet I am dieing for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it again.     Anthony Hopkins is excellent with his creepy hannibal lecter-like performance.     Ryan Gosling is so sexy with superb acting skills.    Together Ryan and Anthony are brilliant. Each scene with the two of them is so intense it makes you wanna scream.     INTENSE is the perfect word for this movie. IT WAS SO INTENSE! Definately a must see film.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|Hi, I have used a 12C for many years - needed it for the CFA exams.  The new one has the advantage of allowing for non-RPN input, so that is good for balancing the checkbook, but of course so is RPN. The buttons feel very good. One complaint is that sometimes I have to hit the on button twice before it goes on.  The other thing is, with investments getting into the billions, they should have added more zeroes to the display, as they have on other HP calculators.  Finally, on stock options, you have to enter a 99 step program for Black Scholes - that should be hard coded into the calculator.  Without these issues, I would have given the new calculator 5 stars.  HP, you now know what to do next.     Best,    John Girton, CFA  Investment Portfolio Manager

B000F0UUIM|3.0|I was introduced to this, one of John Wayne's most well known films, in an American Indian Cinema course.  We viewed it as an example of the depiction of Native Americans in 1950s cinema.  Of course, I probably don't need to even bother mentioning that the Native people featured in this film are on the \\"villain's team.\\"  Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) is searching for Debbie (Natalie Wood) a White girl kidnapped by the Comanches and is married to Scar (Henry Brandon).  She has totally been immersed in the Comanche culture and has lost touch with the customs of her biological family.  Ethan is traveling with Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a young man of mixed Native and White ancestry.  There is also an ambiguity about the true nature of the men's relationship.  Are they related or just out to reunite Debbie with her family?<br /><br />There is no doubt that this film is a visual masterpiece.  Directors like Martin Scorsese consider this film a model for their filmmaking, with good reason.  You can't go wrong with sweeping landscapes and scenic shots of dry plains.  The acting is, at times, quite cardboard (to be diplomatic) and John Wayne is the epitome of the anti-hero loner who is led to do good for people for an unseen reason.  Also, that walk of his (a sort of hip swiveling swagger) is something you just have to see to believe.  No one has really been able to replicate John Wayne's moves, to this day (at least, not in my opinion).  The view of Native Americans in this story is stereotypical and negative (not unusual for John Ford westerns or John Wayne vehicles).  Yet, the role of Scar is a direct parallel to the role of Ethan, and their similarities transcend their differences in a caricaturish way.  I can almost guarantee that anyone who takes issue with the bad depiction of Native Americans in cinema will be offended by several of the scenes (one of which involving a Comanche bride that is \\"traded\\" off to John Wayne--I want elaborate on it here.).  Nevertheless, it is a film worth a view (or two), because it is well known for a good reason.  Watch it and form your own opinions.a film worth a view (or two), because it is well known for a good reason.  Watch it and form your own opinions.
1594489505|4.0|I anxiously awaited Hosseini's second book; I was not disappointed. I couldn't put the book down, but it was not as compelling a story as \\"The Kite Runner\\". That being said, I am glad I had the opportunity to get to know the two strong women in \\"A Thousand Spendid Suns\\".
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I first became familiar with the wonderful work of filmmaker Akira Kurosawa with his DREAMS.  It was a required film in my non-western art course.  For starters, many of these eight vignettes feel directly inspired and lifted out of Japanese screen art.  They start off in a very engaging way and then end very abruptly (not unlike real-life dreams).  They leave you wanting more and it is often pretty frustrating because you are just getting lost in the stories when they come to a close.  They are inspired by Kurosawa's childhood, Japanese folklore and Van Gogh's cornfield painting (among other storylines).  The short stories are brilliantly shot and the colors are breathtaking.  It's a shame that I didn't see this on the big screen.  If this is ever re-released in the movie theater, I would have to go see it!  In the meantime, viewers, please don't miss out on this film.  It's wonderful and poignant.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|Its ironic that Madonna's better stage performances are all coming late in her career. \\"The Confessions Tour\\" is by far her most artistic, musically challenging and diverse concert tour, and this package only serves to reiterate what an astounding talent she is. This review is primarily for the DVD, as the CD is just the audio of the DVD ripped anyway.<br /><br />Think about this - what other 48 year old do you know who can perform aerobic dancing, sing simultaneously, and hold a note, all while wearing a bikini! Well, I certainly don't know anyone like that, and what is perhaps most astounding is just how classy the entire act is, even through the admittedly sexually charged bits.<br /><br />The best thing on this 2.5 hour extravaganza is \\"Erotica\\", a completely reworked version (in actuality, Madonna sings the original version of `Erotica' she intended for release - with the lyrics of a track called \\"You Thrill Me\\"). My favorite part is the last four-song segment, where Madonna introduces her `Disco' persona. Her backup dancers as ever, defy gravity and are good-looking to boot. One dancer in particular stands out - a skinny long haired young man who is as flexible as a rubber band. However, \\"Erotica\\" has never looked so good in any of its' avatars, and I thought this version left the studio recording light years behind - its that good.<br /><br />This is also the first Madonna concert to feature so much dancing. Madonna actually dances frenetically to many numbers, including a highly stylized and choreographed routine with two female backup dancers to \\"Music\\". There is also a special feature segment that shows her practicing this - unbelievable. I have had so many friends who were dancers in their 20s who didn't move like this. I still cannot believe this is a woman pushing 50.<br /><br />Above all, there is the music. Tracks that seemed weak on the \\"Confessions\\" studio album, are made more accessible here. \\"Get Together\\" which I always used to skip, becomes a keeper. Similarly, weak track \\"Jump\\" is actually listenable on this one. Some of the more interesting portions of the concert involve Madonna's friend \\"Isaac\\" (who even wears a turban at one point). I thought this was Mirwais, but I could be wrong. Unfortunately, when she tries to make this concert `spiritual' or `soulful', it begins to unravel. They should have just kept this entire concert upbeat and energetic.<br /><br />No review would be complete without telling you the downsides of the product, and there are three here. One is the godawful version of \\"Isaac\\" that Madonna tries to pull off here. This is a poor second cousin to \\"Frozen\\", with a similar `Eastern' tinge to it (I could see where they were going with this one, but it just doesn't work). This is followed by a dreary rendition of \\"Drowned World\\" (possibly Madonna's greatest ballad), which is followed by the hideous \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\" (which is a beautiful song, but Isaac and Madonna ruin it beyond recognition here). This should be seen to be believed. How they could massacre a simple melody like this is beyond me.<br /><br />However, we're back in action with singalong versions of \\"Hung Up\\" (including a four minute shout-out/call-back to the audience where Madonna asks them to repeat \\"Time goes back, so slowly\\" in her infamously fake British accent), and \\"Sorry\\" (which has Madonna kissing one of her female dancers, and some amount of funky dancing).<br /><br />Madonna sometimes exits the stage every now and then, whereupon her dancers take the spotlight and dance to a variety of Madonna collages and flash images. This is not necessarily a good thing - in fact, its downright boring. However, the `special features' on the disc, aren't really special at all. In fact, they are at best footage of Madonna rehearsing, with a tremendous amount of time spent on her dancers waxing about her in French accents (\\"I can't believe I'm really here\\", \\"Oh My God, I'm dancing for Madonna!\\", and \\"This is a once in a lifetime experience!\\" etc.). Nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly nothing to write home about. But the great thing about these is watching Madonna actually dance.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I remember when these films first came out and they were a runaway success, much more so than anyone could have predicted. Anyone who is at all interested in musicals, and even if they're not, will love this collection of clips which represent truly the best studio for the genre. They show MGM at its greatest, and I'm sorry to say, we will never see anything like that studio again. But as Liza Minelli said in the first one, \\"Thank God for film.\\" At least we can still see what made them so great and cherish them forever.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I won't spend my time rehashing the events that led up to today; I'm sure we're all familiar with them. I'll move on and say that I believe &#34;My December&#34; is the best follow-up to &#34;Breakaway&#34; that could have been made; it builds on the rocker image she's been cultivating and contains music that is evolutionary leaps from what came before.<br /><br />Case in point: the current single &#34;Sober.&#34; It could have been an obvious ballad like &#34;Because of You&#34; and followed its pop formula, but it is so much more--contemplative at the outset, slowly burning and building, and culminating in stratospheric vocals that give me chills every time.<br /><br />There's a definite thread of bleakness on the album, but quite a few songs interrupt that, more than `insiders' would have you think. &#34;One Minute&#34; is awesome, with a catchy, staccato guitar and well-produced background vocals. It really needs to be the next single. &#34;How I Feel&#34; has an overall sense of fun. It feels very summery, with little flourishes of California pop here and there. &#34;Yeah&#34; was previewed during last year's tour, but I remember it being more rocking; here it's reminiscent of Christina Aguilera, and gives us a bit of the R&B she should never totally leave behind.<br /><br />&#34;Be Still&#34; is gorgeous; the perfect slow song, evocative in the colors it brings to mind, and Kelly shows tremendous restraint. &#34;Irvine&#34; is simply a triumph. It's not at all what I expected, with a Spanish-sounding accompaniment and very spare vocals with inflections of Erikah Badu or Billie Holliday. This could have been a typical emotional ballad due to the material it's taken from, so this divergence is cool. And the background `ooohs' during the chorus are quite eerie.<br /><br />There's a little middle-of-the-road fare also: &#34;Don't Waste Your Time&#34; and &#34;Can I Have a Kiss,&#34; both of which are a bit more Breakaway-ish and with good hooks. Rock-lite, I suppose.<br /><br />You know, the bitter, edgier songs aren't so bad; like I said, there's enough of a balance overall that I don't assume anyone will be jumping out of a window. &#34;Judas,&#34; &#34;Maybe,&#34; and the Evanescence-esque &#34;Haunted&#34; took some time to grow on me, but the latter two could be legitimate singles. But they do sit like a heavy weight in the middle of the album, and it takes several hearings to distinguish the particulars of each. The third track &#34;Hole&#34; could become a fan favorite. It has such a dissonant guitar lick, a big departure from Kelly-World, and on the whole reminds me more of an established male rock group.<br /><br />The hidden track &#34;Chivas&#34; is a little throwaway but fun to listen to nonetheless. She takes a page from Tori Amos with the vocals in the chorus, and is a ringer for Mariah Carey in other spots.<br /><br />I hated having to wait so long for &#34;My December&#34; - first they said February, then March, then May, and so on - but this album will make you forget the wait. I hope you give the album a second and third hearing if at first you're not quite sure, because you will find more honest, earnest artistry here than on many albums found at the music store today.se.<br /><br />You know, the bitter, edgier songs aren't so bad; like I said, there's enough of a balance overall that I don't assume anyone will be jumping out of a window. &#34;Judas,&#34; &#34;Maybe,&#34; and the Evanescence-esque &#34;Haunted&#34; took some time to grow on me, but the latter two could be legitimate singles.

B00000K3D4|5.0|I think the title say's it all. I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid, it was a big thing in my home as I grew up listening to Bowie right down from his Ziggy days. I had forgotten how that felt until my daughter came home one afternoon telling me about this movie her teacher showed the class during the last week of school... I can't remember exactly how she explained her view of the movie, but I knew exactly what she was talking about and began singing some of the songs in it... \\"You remind me of the babe.. The Babe? The babe with the power.....\\" And she beamed a brilliant smile as she said \\"Yes! that one...\\" To this day, that movie gets more play then any disney movie my kids have.. They adore watching that movie.. often going round singing the very same somes... I was glad of the reminder my daughter brought hoem of a childhood long since gone. Even more that I found the movie..

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|With all the negative crap from Clive Davis and the RCA label, I didn't know what to expect. I am very surprised that I not only love this CD, but I actually think it's the best one she has put out in her young career.  <br />Some of my favorites are Sober, Chivis, Be Still, How I Feel, Irvine, heck, I love them all. Bravo Kelly, you did good.
0880796863|2.0|I am SO disappointed in this deck! I'd seen a well worn copy of \\"The Original Rider Waite\\" and fell in love with the coloring, especially the seafoam greens in place of the water blues in the other Rider deck I have (ISBN#0-913866-13-x). I also liked the way skin is colored with red pointalistic dotting, as if to indicate blood/life in the flesh. Greys in the other deck are done in ranges of cream/beige/tan colors in the \\"original.\\" Purples in the \\"regular\\" are a deeper, richer crimson in the \\"original.\\" Red in the \\"original\\" is deeper, less orangey. Often color is visually textured like parchment or done in crosshatching lines of color, or tiny dotting of color, which looked great in my friends worn copy. I noticed so many more things in the images than I had in my other Rider Waite Smith deck and I liked the idea of having a deck with colors more closely resembling the original deck and symbolism. So, I could hardly wait to get this, but when it came in, my heart sunk. Another reviewer mentioned how shiny and slippery these cards were, which didn't sound good... but when I saw it for myself, it was much worse than I'd imagined. They're coated in some kind of plastic that is so shiny light glares off of it. I had to hold the cards at just so an angle to see them clearly. The upsides of the coating -may- be that it can make shuffling more slippery, which some may prefer, though I prefer cards with a more \\"organic\\" feel to them. Or maybe the plastic helps prevent moisture absorption? I haven't tested this theory out, yet, but I prefer cards that can \\"breathe,\\" exchange with the elements in their environment and our hands. Perhaps the plastic coating was a way to cheap out on the paper quality and durability of the cards. It seems a little like this, when comparing the feel, weight, and flexibility of this deck with my regular Rider pack. I'm wondering if this coating will peel up from the edges... in some places it looks like there's a visible layering that could peel.<br /><br />Also, the black outlining quality is unclear, blurry, compared to the other Rider deck I have. For example, it's harder to distinguish the zodiac symbols in the Charioteer's belt, nor the other glyphs of his \\"skirt.\\" For analogy, if this deck had been printed on a home desktop printer, the difference between the decks would be like setting print quality to \\"draft\\" at times, and at best \\"standard,\\" rather than \\"fine.\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure what to do with these cards... same them for emergency readings in misty, damp situations? Give them away? Try to return them? I just hope I can find a printing of the \\"original\\" colors, but less slick, shiny plastic. Maybe there was an earlier, better printing for this edition? I'm hoping my friend will tell me his deck was once so shiny and slick, but time and use will mute it. I'll follow-up if I find out.<br /><br />2 stars for the coloring.l.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The photography on this series is amazing. Some shots they waited for weeks to get.  Highly recommend.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I can't say I was a fan of the show in the beginning of its run.  I tend to watch more cartoons than sitcoms.  When I first met my girlfriend, she got me into watching this show.  At first I only watched it because that meant I got to sit and hold her for 30 minutes; but the show kinda grew on me.    I like friends, and even though they didn't really have any other RACES on the show as regulars, you could find a piece of yourself in at least one of the six characters.    I am definately Chandler.
1594489505|5.0|This is a worthy successor to the Kite Runner.  It is about the plight of many women in Afghanistan as told through two characters's lives. It is a story beautifully and sensitively told and covers the time before the Russian invasion through the time of the Taliban.  I was totally engaged throughout the reading of this book and as always with Hosseini, I learned much along the way.  American readers should heed the warnings implicit in this book - that fundamentalist religions run by men always result in women losing their freedom and options.
0385340559|5.0|\\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" has taken Jack Reacher from mythical proportion to somewhat \\"human\\" in his characteristics.  Though not his best work, I felt that the book was excellent compared to the competition.  I always look forward to the next Lee Child novel.  As with the previous Jack Reacher novels, I would recommend this wholeheartedly!
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Death Hunt starring Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson is certainly one film that will never end up on the Lifetime channel.  Director Peter R. Hunt and Scriptwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor do a bang up job moving the standard western film formula to 1930's Canada.  The Yukon backdrop is as much a part of this film as Monument Valley is to a John Ford Western.  This film carries that uneasy feeling of trouble right from the get go.  Granted it is based on a real incident, but doesn't follow the real historical line, and so what.  Death Hunt is meant to be pure men's entertainment.  Lee Marvin as Sgt. Millen of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who has been in the backwater for too long, knows that he represents law an civilization to a group of folks who could care less.  He is a pragmatist who knows just how much to let the locals get away with, as long as it keeps the lid on.  Marvin is exquisite as the grizzled drunken professional, who in his own way, is running from civilization as much as any of the ignorant locals.  I forsee a retrospective of the work of Charles Bronson definitely including the film Death Hunt.  Bronson plays Albert Johnson who shows up in town, out of nowhere.  A man tired of life, it seems, who just wants to be left alone.  But, he is not a man, like most of the people in that town, who will ignore suffering, and that even applies to animals.  This is where the trouble begins.  The film contains a great supporting cast, Ed Lauter, as Hazel, the ignorant dogfighting trapper who thinks that he is the defacto king of this barbaric place.  Andrew Stevens as the young, piss and vinegar, Mountie assigned to Millen's outpost is great.  The film also boasts Carl Weathers as an ex-patiriot American black, who found a life in this part of Canada that was denied to him in the U.S.  The film is a great chase.  You find yourself routing for hunter and hunted alike.  With Death Hunt you get great direction, great dialogue, great scenic locations, and wonderful acting.  This all adds up to A plus entertainment.  A great film.  Buy the DVD!
6305897786|5.0|Loved the movie for its atmosphere.  I read one review in a literary magazine that explained the mysteries to my satisfaction.  The main character's name is \\"Corso\\" - sounds similar to \\"cursed one\\" even though in the movie, he said that it means \\"one who travels\\".   Johnny Depp looks like the quintessential devil with his goatee and dark hair with gray around the side.  The review I read said that the devil had lost his way on earth and needed to get \\"home\\".  The \\"guardian angel\\" provided clues to him and safeguarded him.  Remember how surprised she looked when he accidentally bumped into her, causing her nose to bleed.  Like she was not used to having any \\"mortals\\" injure her like that.  Also, he always played up vices, like constantly smoking, drinking, cheating people.  One of the drawings showed the \\"guardian angel\\" riding the three headed beast (literally - and this is a biblical symbol for the devil)and pointing back to the castle or the ninth gate.  When Boris Balkan wanted to meet the devil so badly, he never realized that he really had.  An interesting thought, anyway.
B00006JDVV|2.0|Bale and Scorupco must have died a thousand deaths delivering the movie's last lines.  I got goosebumps in sympathetic mortification for the actors.  Seriously cringe-worthy.      But I didn't expect the movie to turn out quite so bad, at least not from its beginning.  Actually, it starts pretty well -- our hero as a boy opening up a Pandora's box of dragons and then his grown-up voice-over (though oddly his accent changed) sequence narrating the disaster that ensued.  Standard stuff for post-apocalyptic sci-fi but I kinda like that and that part is edited with some momentum.  And there are a few nice moments, notably a very endearing pop culture movie re-enactment, a few droll lines, and some fun popcorn-crunching here and there.  It's not all bad and Bale's Quinn is a hugely likable upright guy.  But what with a script that forces its actors to do too much awkward exposition, a hilarious over-the-top militaristic score that begs for the A-Team and Saturday afternoon tv, grammatical errors in the set props, and an actor (McConnaughey) who alternately grunts/preaches/cries and who you just can't quite believe knows the meaning of 'epidemiology' as he utters it, plus that mortifying ending... holy cow, batman, it does get bad.      But not so bad that it should go cult.  The badness here is not a heroic, epic, capital-B bad.  Just amateurish.
B00006399Z|5.0|I owned this record (and I still do although it's a bit scratched up) back in high school.  One of my all time favorite live albums.  The CD sounds great.  I would rate this as the my all time favorite Traffic album.
B00062J00S|5.0|Not only do I own this movie, I have the board game as well. No Christmas season is complete without at least one viewing of this classic movie. It stresses the idea of being grateful for what you have and seeing the silver lining in any given situation. Children of all ages should watch this one every year.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|Joe B. has monster chops, especially for a blues rocker, in the tradition of Gary Moore and...gee, no one else I can think of from that genre!  This DVD showcases Joe's tremendous talent with a six-string, and his powerful, gritty voice.  The band is tight and the concert, set in a very intimate club, is cleverly and crisply captured on film.  It feels like you're there!  Players will enjoy plenty of close-ups of Joe's lightning-fast fretwork.  While the blues standards are beautifully rendered, the big surprise comes when Joe infuses some prog-rock: very engaging arrangements of Yes's Heart of the Sunrise and Starship Troopers.  Where'd that come from, Joe?  Well worth the price, and you'll want to watch it more than once.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Fantastic music! What a joy to listen to. And the DVD is well worth the purchase as well. We have listened to both DVD and CD many times over and even loaned them out a few times to friends. A definite must for anyone that enjoys beautiful Irish music.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson continues to break the mold from \\"American Idol\\" and stake her place as one of the biggest voices in the music industry today! \\"Never Again\\"; \\"Hole\\"; \\"Sober\\"; \\"How I Feel\\" stand out as excellent contenders for pop radio! Clive - Here is a big plate of CROW! Kelly, once again you have amazed me. Your voice soars, and swells and gives me chills in every note you sing. THE BEST FEMALE VOICE TODAY! Rush out and buy this one, you won't be disappointed!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I bought this DVD and CD as a gift for my husband's birthday. We saw a preview on public television and he immediately asked for it for his birthday. We already own the first Celtic Woman DVD and CD (also seen on public tv and purchased thru Amazon)and this is an amazing sequel to the original. All new music and a beautiful setting for this irish music. The women's voices are ethereal, very much worth listening to and watching over and over again.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I became a fan when they opened for Megadeth.  Let me tell you, I was taken away by their melodic breaks which take you into a different consciousness.  Systematic Chaos is, in my opinion, the best record they have put out so far.      Every song gets better and better and DT takes you into a different place.  A different realm which needs to be enjoyed  as it is blended with thoughtful lyrics and creative rhythm breaks.
B00000K3CK|4.0|This is another classic movie of which I have more than one version. I do enjoy this version's \\"Kris Kringle\\" very much and Natalie Wood was fantastic as Susan. Maureen O'Hara made a great mother and the story speaks for itself, if you believe. . . .
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album was something Kelly really believed in and I think it's great. It's not the SYBG Kelly but she doesn't completely disregard it either.<br />Yes it's a bit darker, yes it's not very commercial but so what? Kelly has proven that she is a brilliant singer, one of the best out there. Her fans stuck by her and they always will. Maybe if people weren't so concerned about what the media says they would give it a chance rather then just brush it off.<br /><br />If you take a listen to songs like Sober, Maybe, Haunted, Can I have a Kiss, Irvine , How I feel, and even Never Again you will see that Kelly's writing is quite good and her voice is just the cherry on top.<br /><br />This album def deserves more credit then it got. It's ok though Kelly doesn't give up and has a new album on the way (3/10/09)
B000NA28IE|1.0|This movie was nothing compared to the book. It sped through things way to fast and allowed abosolutley no time for character development I gave this movie one star because I thought that it was an awaful movie and would not recomend this movie to anyone.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I liked this movie. It gave great insight into the inner workings of the palace at that time.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can't even begin to describe TOOL, other than that listening is believing. Amazing, amazing band. I just saw these guys 2 weeks ago on the 10,000 Days Tour in Winston-Salem, and it was the best live performance I have witnessed, hands down...  Ok, so for \\"Lateralus\\"...Yeah, it's my favorite TOOL album, although I am a big fan of Aenima and Undertow. I think it's slightly funny that when this album came out back in '01 most TOOL fans were confused by it, only now, in '07, to call it their favorite. Each song is a journey itself within the entire album experience. I feel that \\"Lateralus\\" showcases each bandmember the best of all their albums. \\"The Grudge\\" is probably TOOL's best album-opener. Maynard has some awesome, intense lyrics: \\"Saturn comes back around! Picks you up like a child! Or drags you down like a Stone! Sinking deeper!\\" And Adam Jones has some awesome licks here. Now for \\"Schism,\\" I will say I originally felt indifferent about it for awhile, now I just get it. \\"Reflection\\" is a very note-worthy song; Easily one of my Top 3 TOOL songs. Awesome beat from Danny Carey. I just wish I could've gone to the '02 Lateralus Tour to hear it played live.....And \\"Lateralus\\"...God, it's indescribable. One of the most rockinest, inspiring and powerful songs I have ever heard, EVER. The best way I can describe it to someone who hasn't heard it, is it's like the equivalent of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in modern times.  Just buy this album, OR download it, NOW. Maynard is legendary. Danny is one hell of a drummer and could lay down a beat for ANY metal band on earth. Justin Chancellor is a pretty sick basist (again \\"Reflection\\" is tight). And Adam is Adam; The guy is capable of melting anyone's face off with a guitar solo. AND go see TOOL live; You won't be disappointed.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Had there been no fuss about the feud with Clive Davis to cloud things, \\"My December\\" would be viewed as the work of a confident, maturing artist.  The material on this album is darker than \\"Breakaway,\\" but more expressive, intelligent, and fully realized.  It's not all \\"Never Again\\": songs like \\"Sober\\" and \\"Irvine\\" are as gripping as any of Clarkson's previous hits, and have much more of value to say to her audience.  Most impressive are the performances themselves; the musicians are solid and the vocals intense and incisive.  Over time, when people are able to appreciate the album on its merits, \\"My December\\" may come to be perceived as Clarkson's best, most personal work -- and the realization of a \\"voice\\" all her own.  Try it.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This album is weak, and so is Linkin Park. I'll admit, I used to be into LP somewhat back when \\"Hybrid Theory\\" came out, but that was back when I was a freshman in highschool. I'm about to graduate college; Times have changed. Since critics have decided to label this release as \\"the best album in years,\\" I've decided to label Linkin Park as \\"Cookie-Cutter-Rock.\\" Nothing new, nothing bold, nothing inventive was accomplished.  Ok seriously, the most difficult instrumentals that I've heard from this release are PIANO. Freakin Piano, dude, not \\"raprock.\\" I don't understand how anyone can make the claim that \\"this is the best release of the year!\\" and be completely serious. Actually, yes I do. Linkin Park markets for middleschool-aged kids who don't know what to expect from the \\"Rock\\" genre; They just think the word \\"raprock\\" sounds cool, cause MTV told them it was *new earthshattering stuff.* A 10yr old kid just learning to play guitar could learn to play some of these tabs in less than a week. I mean how hard could it be to learn 3 or 4 or 5 power cords then play them over and over and over at a very mellow, chill pace? If I wanted mellow and chill, I would have bought a Moe. or Keller Williams album.  I dare any of you: Go out and buy TOOL's \\"Lateralus\\" or \\"10,000 Days\\" and then tell me that LP rocks more. Go buy the new NIN album \\"Year Zero\\" and then tell me that LP can do better. Trent Reznor accomplishes more BY HIMSELF than Linkin Park can do with 6 people. Go buy some Deftones albums like \\"Adrenaline\\" or \\"Around the Fur\\" or \\"White Pony\\" and then tell me if you think LP rocks with the best of em. Hell, go buy the new Rush album and tell me that LP outdid them. Bottomline: If Curt Kobain were still around, he'd probably laugh at this.  Just look at what other people have said! \\"It doesn't really do anything to distinguish itself from the type of alt-rock that you can find almost anywhere.\\" The end.
B000PHX8QQ|4.0|If the opening seconds of Justice's debut album, \\" Cross,\\" don't tell you a thing about what you're in store for, you aren't listening. The mudded brass come marching in like they are coming to destroy, and in a way they are. Justice is a dance/electronica group, to be sure, but to label them as such is travesty in and of itself. Like that imperial death march, Justice is here to destroy. In this case, they have come to demolish your preconceived notions about what dance music is and what it can be. Now, until recently I have avidly campaigned against the genre which I feel is cluttered with mundane \\"artists\\" who rely on bad samples and horrendous loops to captivate a somewhat dimwitted audience. My opinion is slowly starting to change as I am introduced to artists who are challenging this perception. Justice is one of them.<br /><br />From the opening track to the very last second of \\"Cross,\\" I found myself, not only captivated, but amazed, entertained, and energized. Justice comes off as a bull charging towards its victim, with so much momentum and energy that attempting to slow it down would be a fruitless endeavor. Their songs are constantly changing, never relying on a single loop or phrase for too long. And these songs are not lite, easy-listening electronica songs either. They're harsh and brash, with the mids turned up too high for comfort. It's not your average dance album, it is a revelation!<br /><br />\\"Let There Be Light\\" begins with a near-unlistenable melody, but adds in drums, a thumping bassline, and so many cuts and glitches that you'll be in love with it before you know it. It concludes with an absolutely awesome composition that harmonizes synths with synths in a way that sounds like it'd be better suited for the closing credits of a Super Mario Bros. game than a dance record. \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is one of the few songs on \\" \\" with actual vocals, and while I found them a bit childish and annoying at first, I was shocked to find the song stuck in my head hours after I first encountered. The song sounds like the Jackson 5 on methamphetamines, if only for the lyrics, \\"Do the D.A.N.C.E., stick to the B.E.A.T.\\" The disco-esque strings and sing-along quality of the song make the song a sure-fire hit, which is probably why it is the album's first single.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, there's the cut-filled \\"New Jack,\\" the completely overpowering, yet satisfying \\"Phantom Pt. I\\" (and it's more audience friendly second part), and the 100% guilty pleasure \\"The Party.\\" The latter features such terrible rap-lines as \\"Let's get drunk and freaky-fied,\\" and if you actually find yourself liking it, then you may want to see if pigs grew wings. It's the one low point on an otherwise flawless album.<br /><br />The best part about \\"Cross\\" is the fact that it never gets boring, an attribute clearly made possible by the group's insistence on keeping the songs fresh around every corner and their refusal to use one loop or riff for any extended period of time. The quality of the songs is through the roof, and the genres touched upon in each song are too numerous to mention. While \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is clearly your crowd-pleaser, songs like \\"Stress\\" (which envokes serious Requiem for a Dream soundtrack memories) and \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" are designed for the sole purpose of making you nod your head in approval while simultaneously scratching it, thinking \\"What the heck am I listening to?\\" \\" \\" is an achievement in electronic music that should be listened to by fans and naysayers of the genre alike.

The song sounds like the Jackson 5 on methamphetamines, if only for the lyrics, \\"Do the D.A.N.C.E., stick to the B.E.A.T.\\" The disco-esque strings and sing-along quality of the song make the song a sure-fire hit, which is probably why it is the album's first single.    Elsewhere on the album, there's the cut-filled \\"New Jack,\\" the completely overpowering, yet satisfying \\"Phantom Pt. I\\" (and it's more audience friendly second part), and the 100% guilty pleasure \\"The Party.\\" The latter features such terrible rap-lines as \\"Let's get drunk and freaky-fied,\\" and if you actually find yourself liking it, then you may want to see if pigs grew wings. It's the one low point on an otherwise flawless album.    The best part about \\"Cross\\" is the fact that it never gets boring, an attribute clearly made possible by the group's insistence on keeping the songs fresh around every corner and their refusal to use one loop or riff for any extended period of time.

B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This is such a fun movie to watch!  Wonderful!  I have watched it at least 3 times since I bought it.  It makes you want to learn ballroom dancing.  But once you see the behind scenes and how hard ballroom dancing is, you gain a huge respect for it all. The widescreen version is the absolute best I have seen.
B000G6BJS0|2.0|This set deserves 5 stars based on the performances.  But my set contains a CD number 6 that has problems.  I arranged for a replacement set from Amazon, but that set had the same poor CD 6.  Thus I have concluded that all current CD sets have a defective CD 6.  Some players I used could not access the disc.  Those that could produced sounds with pops and clicks: sounded like an old LP record.  I have written to EMI, but no results so far.
B00004Z400|4.0|My fave song is \\"Change\\". I like this album because it flows well. It isn't too hardcore nor too mellow. I also like the song at the end. I listen to it on repeat. Love Deftones.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I don't have a HD DVD - and some how you sent it to me. How do I reurn it to you for credit?
0385340559|5.0|This is yet another whirlwind read by the author who brought us the magnificent Jack Reacher.  From the first page to the last it's almost impossible to put down.  Once again Jack Reacher saves the world.  What would we do without him??  I wouldn't want to find out!  He is one of the best heroes we have in literature today.  I can't wait for the next chapter in his  take it one day at the time world.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|ITS A WONDERFULL DRAMA CAN LEARN LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE, ANYWAY IM ENJOYING IT.
B0000AK7AA|3.0|There was something about Casper that attracted me to it, although I'm now a twenty-something. Could it be something to do with the fact I never actually got around to watching it when I was young? Probably. BUT I did have the movie novelisation, complete with film stills. Hehe.<br /><br />I do get in the mood to watch kiddies' movies now again (or movies aimed purely at pre-teen squealing girls), it's something to do with reliving my childhood. But with Casper, I seriously don't think I could have watched this as a kid. It was so boring! The first half anyway. I thought it kicked it towards the end, but I was bored throughout the first half, and started texting on my phone. Not a good sign.<br /><br />However, I love Christina Ricci, she's definitely one of my favourite actresses, and have recently been watching some of her older films, after seeing Addams Family Values on TV! I always loved some of her older roles (Now & Then is a particular favourite), and she certainly surpassed herself in this, with having to act opposite a CGI character after all.<br /><br />I do wish there had been a bit more of a storyline with Casper & his deceased dad. There wasn't much mentioned about it, I kinda had an idea in my head of what Edward Scissorhands did, with the flashback interaction scenes between Johnny Depp & Vincent Price. (Technically not his dad, the inventor, but never mind.) And is it just me, or is it never clearly explained how Casper died? I found out on IMDB that he was playing on his sled all day, and got pneumonia, but I don't remember that being said. Or was that when I was texting?<br /><br />Casper is a safe family film. There are no innuendoes in this, as so many kiddie films have in them these days, which are for the adults to understand, and the kids to understand some day. It's safe, boring & predictable. I did get all emotional at the end (look out for Devon Sawa starring opposite Christina again, and sharing their second screen kiss!), but it does take a while to get going. The beginning is definitely not kids friendly.ginning is definitely not kids friendly.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I really had not paid this cd any attention until one day,at a friend  pool party it was playing.From listerning to it then I knew i like it this a good cd.
0143038419|1.0|I started listening to the audiobook, but couldn't get past Italy.  I got the book because I will be turning 30 in less than a year and thought I might be able to relate and/or learn something valuable from the author.  At first I thought she was right on, but then we just started to drift apart.  I became more and more annoyed at her \\"problems\\" - honestly, compared to the real problems of many people, she came off as petty and very very self-centered.  Is this what I have to look forward to in my 30s?  Also, it must be nice to be able to just take off a year and travel.  If I had the time and resources to do something like that I'd be counting my blessings instead of moaning about the relationships I sabotaged.  Did I make a mistake by returning the cd to the library so soon?  Should I at least have stuck it out though India?  Is there any hope for this book?
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Bought it for my 17 year old grand daughter, who loves Grease, she loves it.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I have been a big fan of the 80's movies and this one is one of my favorites! The story flows well with the characters, and the cast works very well together and they seem very believable. My favorite character was the typical bad boy who became friends with Eric Stolz and the party scene towards the end was the real highlight of the movie for me. It was somewhat predictable but has a great ending. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get sick of it. Enjoy!!
0757302661|1.0|I listened to the audio CD several times - it had a lot of breathing exercises.  Each time I became dizzy and started to hyperventilate!  I brought the CD into my midwife and she said to stop listening to it right away.  She said that when the body is completely relaxed, it knows exactly how to breathe.  My midwife said, \\"The techniques used in this CD are from the 60's and we don't do that kind of breathing anymore during pregnancy or labor.\\" She also said, \\"This author knows nothing about pregnancy or labor - she's just a hypnotist.\\"  She recommended that I use another method and I did - it was WONDERFUL!
B000P2A256|5.0|i loved Songs About Jane and this is a great follow up. same great tunes and lover's angst.... good album.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I received the movie yesterday and have watched it 2 times all the way through.  This is a wonderful video and worth the price.  Today good movies are very hard to find.  Alot of women look for a romantic movie but one that has substance to it.  North and South has that.  Mr. Thornton and Margaret tell a tale of a man and woman who come from two literally different worlds.  Their lives collide and you can tell from the moment they see each other that there is a definite attraction.    I think the best part is watching the love unfold - not through sex or innuendo but rather through gentle touching of the hands and looks in their eyes and on their faces.      You fall in love with the characters immediately and become part of their world - you laugh with them and cry with them and you love them.    This is a movie for any woman who has romance in her heart and a man in her life she knows belongs to her.  Because that is exactly what North and South epitomizes.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|At first listen i didnt like the album and then as i listened more i liked it even less.  I expected much more from a band that has been nothing less of excellence and creativity.This album lacks both.  I can see why some 14-18 year olds might like this album but as a 28 year old ive learn to expect more.  the songs are simple and nothing to pull you into them  basically i cant beleive its linkin park
1594489505|5.0|My Hollywood Manager/Producer son called one day at least three years ago to sing the praises of The Kite Runner.  He had just read the book and LOVED it.  He then called his top screen writer, David Benioff, who read the book and LOVED it. Eventually, his top director, Marc Forster, read the book and ADORED it.  They \\"pitched it\\" and studios LOVED AND ADORED it. It was then that I read the book.  I LOVED AND ADORED IT.  So, I have been a fan of Khaled Hosseini ever since.  I was thrilled to receive a manuscript of A Thousand Splendid Suns several months before its release and LOVED and ADORED it even more than The Kite Runner.  I have a google alert for Khaled Hosseini and the reviews have been pouring in.  About 98% of them are positive to the max. Never mind that a few negatories suggest that it's not great literature.  It's a helluva read, not to mention a wonderful history lesson about Afghanistan during the last thirty or so years and the personal traumas that individual inhabitants of that country have endured. I can't think of a book that I would recommend more than this gem!  Oh, by the way, DO see The Kite Runner due to release in the Fall.  The stories of the filming of the movie in China are amazing.
B000001ESF|5.0|go buy this album right now if you dont have it. what the heck are you waiting for?
1594489505|5.0|The book arrived as advertized - like new.   And I can't put it down!  A great read.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|this album is pretty damn good. people love to compare new albums to the bands best efforts. lets face it, you cant re-create the past and make it feel just like it did back then. at least dave is trying to write some good new material. if you dont like it there are many other bands you can go ahead and get into. stop comparing this to rust in piece and try to except it for what it offers.
B00026WU82|5.0|this is the absolute TRUTH on REALITY. bob dylan mixes up surrealism, symbolism (from rimbaud)and good old fashioned rock 'n roll to make on of the seminal albums of the lifetime of rock 'n roll. he mixes up a tremendous lyrical beat, wild frenzy and articulated truth in his lyrics to make a classic that will stand the test of time for as long as time goes on. along with blonde on blonde, and bringing it all back home, he reached the absolute pinnacle of describing real reality in poetical terms. in all his later albums, he would never attain this wild greatness again.
B0002234LS|4.0|This movie was on television a few months ago. My daughter who is 15 years old, watched the movie also. She loves Johnny Depp, so I got the movie for her. It's funny, and psychological to me. Poor Mort, his mind was so messed up he couldn't tell reality from fiction.  The DVD also has features about the story. It explains certain scenes about the movie also deleted scenes.  I really liked the man Mort made up Mr. Shooter. The beginning of the movie\\" You stole my story\\" I recommend this movie to any person who likes Johnny Depp.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|this cd displays knopfler at his most fluid, lyrical and smooth. less is more with knopfler. all the notes are held for their maximum emotional effect; he almost cries into the guitar. the songs are great and emmy lou is in fine form, but listen to knopfler play his axe and you know what rock genius is. (along with that tremelous, deep voice of his).
1594489505|5.0|I had not read The Kite Runner, but when I did I ran out immediately to buy A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I cannot even remotely imagine a life these women led. This book is such a wonderful story but it was so painful to read, I had to stop at times. Hosseini has such a gift. I would invent a special prize for this book if I could.
1594489505|5.0|Once again Hosseini has taken us on a journey to a land that we know so little about. It is a heartbreaking story of the way women are treated, but also the love that two women share. I loved this book!!! How is it possible that this book was better than \\"The Kite Runner\\"?
B00009XITQ|5.0|I saw this movie on a referral and was very apprehensive because I had never heard of it. I loved it!! It is one of my favorites now. It's about a teenage girl whose mom married an Englishman in Morocco, while on vacation, but because of his family and political issues, became separated. Her mother leaves him without telling him she is pregnant. So the girl has never met her dad. She goes to Europe to find him, knowing he is Lord Dashwood who is running for Prime Minister. His life is turned upside down by this young American girl. But, he pulls it all together in the end. What a great story!! Great acting. I loved the interviews in the specials section too!
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|You have to like a mellow rock to like this CD. I was able to put it in the player and never felt like I had to skip a song. (come on you all have done it) This CD there was no \\"hated song\\".  A great buy!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Has it already been four years since this came out? My, how the tide of time pulls and rushes. I saw \\"The Concert for George\\" in a state-of-the-art, largely empty movie theater and found it wonderful, but it played even better in my home, channeled through my faithful and exquisite friend, my stereo. This, quite simply, and without belaboring a point made by, at last count, 319 others here on Amazon, is the finest concert film I have ever seen on countless levels. It is a melancholy joy from beginning to end, from Anoushka and the epic, ecstatic Indians to Clapton -- earning every letter in the word genius -- to the always playful Ray Cooper to Ringo to Dhani right through to the strum of the ukes and wonderland of a finish. The cinematography is magnificent as is the sound production and coherence of the band and musical vision. A splendid time is guaranteed for all. God bless John, Paul, George and Ringo.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw this in the theatre, and found myself discussing it with my fellow movie goers all the way home (30 minutes).  The next day I still was figuring out, in my own head, how the pieces all fit together in this movie.  Christopher Nolan has directed my two favorite movies, Memento and The Prestige.<br /><br />Sadly, when I received this on DVD, I was eager to watch it again.  But this time through, I found myself asking why I didn't catch all the clues pointing to the end when I watched it the first time.  The reason? Mr. Nolan knows how to give you all of the info without giving you the key to figuring it out.<br /><br />If you like magic, \\"thinking movies\\", movies with a twist, and paradoxes, you will love this movie.<br /><br />Even David Bowie was great as the part of Nicola Tesla.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It's a memory card and it works.  I haven't had any problems with it and it does what it's supposed to.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|In the '80s, I heard a few songs by Kansas, but never became a devoted fan.  My mistake.  After putting this CD into my car stereo, I really didn't want to arrive at my destination.  I just wanted to finish hearing all of the songs.<br /><br />Carry on Wayward Son, Dust in the Wind and Point of No Return are three that I can listen to over and over without ever getting enough.<br /><br />Kerry Livgren rocks!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album is unbelievable... I was never a Linkin Park fan, too much screaming for my taste. However they have created a sound that I just love. The first single hooked me so I bought the CD and now I can't stop listening to it. I highly recomend it
B000P2A256|5.0|I love their music -I lOVE when I pay for a CD that is WORTH my hard earned money -M5 is 2 for 2 with me!
B000E1MTZE|5.0|There really isn't much to say about this box set.  You get all three Matrix movies in full high-definition, as well as three separate In-Movie Experience tracks along with all the same great supplements that came with the DVD version.  At $65 it's a little pricey, but this is as cheap as it gets and fans of the Matrix won't be disappointed.    Video quality: 4.5   Audio quality: 5.0  Special features: 4.5 (get the Ultimate collection for the most content)  Overall value: 4.5
1594489505|5.0|A powerful and beautifully written story of two women whose fates will cross in a brutal, repressive culture which traps them both, making them helpless victims of their circumstances. It is a realistic, moving story and will transport you to the Afghanistan of their times.
0596009208|3.0|Not sure about this book. With almost 700 pages it is a little daunting. There are a lot of examples, cartoons, jokes, etc. so you aren't reading 700 pages of text. It does have an interesting way of presenting things. I think it may be of more use as I get more into coding java.
1580493939|4.0|I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel. It is worth reading. It is worth buying. I wish I had read this when I was younger. This is one book I will give to my children. If I could, I would make this a part of highschool litterature versus many other pieces we were given to read. It is indeed a classic.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|Asia has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, so when I heard the original quartet reunited and recorded a live album, this attracted my interest.  I've heard live CDs from other incarnations of Asia and the sound quality was lacking.  For a live CD, the sound is good here.  It could be better, but it could be a whole lot worse.  Rather than a rehash of the first album, the band also decided to record one song from each of the band members' pasts.  They do so with satisfying results.  I wondered how Asia was going to pull off \\"Roundabout\\" since John Wetton doesn't \\"communicate with bats\\" like Jon Anderson can, nor does Jon Anderson have to play Chris Squire's bass lines, but John Wetton handled both vocals and the bass parts seemingly without effort.  Geoff Downes is no Rick Wakeman, but he doesn't need to be.  He held up his end.  Sometimes Steve Howe gets lost in the mix, but the song sounds ok.  The band delivered very well.      As the first reviewer mentioned, the acoustic versions of \\"Ride Easy\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" are well done.  I actually prefer the version of \\"Don't Cry\\" here to the original from \\"Alpha.\\"  Steve Howe plays the mandolin while John Wetton handles the acoustic guitar.  The band also plays an acoustic version of \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" (also better than the original) with Steve Howe on dobro.  Take away the studio gloss of their first three albums and you discover these guys are very good musicians.  Steve Howe plays a variety of stringed instruments, John Wetton unplugs with an acoustic guitar, and Geoff Downes does very well with the piano.  Carl Palmer plays flawlessly throughout as always.  I don't think he ever has an off night.    Also noteworthy is the band's rendition of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\"  Greg Lake was a fine singer in his day, but John Wetton outdoes him here.  The thought of a four-piece band playing \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" intrigued me since ELP recorded it without guitars, but Asia makes it work.  It'sa bit ragged, but it doesn't suck.  \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" is a fun listen, especially with John Wetton using a megaphone in places.  Steve Howe gets a solo turn with \\"Intersection Blues\\" from his \\"Natural Timbre\\" solo CD.  Good stuff.    Overall, a good CD well worth every penny spent.  It's good to have the original quartet back.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is one of the best James Bond films yet! To clear up, this film was a restart of the series, much like \\"Batman Begins\\", it IS NOT a prequel. I enjoyed this film a lot, but hope the next one goes back to some of the traditions from the other 20+ bond films. But this is still a great restart of the series; and Daniel Craig is the best bond!
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid, and have always wanted to own it , And now I do, The service is great as far as shipping, And as far as I'm concerned it's John Wayne's best movie, It was made in 1956 when the actors made the movies not the special effects
B0001I55OC|4.0|I love the book and this its one of Mike's greatest. This film isn't as good, but still FUN to watch. If you don't mind bad acting and lame fight scenes. But they did spend a lot of money on the film in some areas so it doesn't feel completely like a made-for-tv-movie.
0385040253|5.0|This is the ONE.  The bible to sailors.  The final authority to marlinspike seamanship and knot work.  Worth every penny!
B000094HMU|5.0|The sets are magnificent -- saw it at the Met and now i have it preserved for me to see over and over again.
1594489505|5.0|I read Kite Runner (this author's first effort, which I would highly recommend) and this is an excellent follow up. Highly recommend, simply a great read.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I don't know why my expectations for The Prestige were set for an average movie. Must've been something that I read. In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />Oh...wait....That's exactly how I started my review for The Illusionist [[ASIN:B000K7VHQ4 The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)]] earlier this year. But the intro does indeed work with The Prestige too.<br /><br />My low expectations were because The Prestige and The Illusionist were released right around the same time, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with both, because both were thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. But the tricks in The Prestige are much more feasibly tricks that could actually be pulled of by a turn of the century magician (with the exception of the machine that was being built by The Prestige's mad scientist David Bowie).<br /><br />Don't expect to go into The Prestige and be truly amazed by wizardry. The Prestige is more the story of rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale), and which one can deliver the ultimate trick before the rival interferes. But--make no mistake--the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, as are the diabolical ways in which each rival gets in the way of the other.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs. The Prestige is not quite the action-packed, super-hero adventure that Nolan's last outing was ( [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] ), but The Prestige delivers its monies worth.<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.
B00008RH3L|5.0|i looked everywhere for this movie retail and amazon was the only one who didn't let me down. millers crossing is everything you need in a gangster movie. plenty of characters you love to hate (caspar, the DANE, the Shmatte) and characters you hate to love (verna, leo, and of course the rogueish Tom). this movie has firepower and surreality. the cohen bros. redefine the genre with a emotional tale of love, betrayal, loyalty and brutality and of course \\"ETHICS\\". BUY IT, WATCH IT AND WATCH IT AGAIN.
1594489505|5.0|Another amazing book by Khaled Hosseini.  If you liked the Kite Runner...this is a must!!!
0743496728|5.0|Once again master storyteller Jodi Picoult delivers a deeply compelling story from an unique perspective.     In the aftermath of a high school shooting, we learn that things aren't always what they seem. This book forces the reader to grapple with a horrific incident (much like the real-life tragedies of Columbine, Virginia Tech, etc) from a perspective that isn't always so \\"black and white.\\"     This novel deals with some heavy/important topics such as: relationships and friendships, the difficulties we face as teenagers and parents, communication, being picked on or bullied, and the consequences of our actions....thus, the novel is extremely relatable and will appeal to a wide audience.     If you have never read a Jodi Picoult book, this a great one to start with and is indicative of her incredible ability to draw the reader in and present a situation from various perspectives. If you're already a Jodi Picoult fan, you will not be disappointed. If you liked \\"The Pact,\\" \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and \\"Plain Truth\\" you will love \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\"
B000N3ST8O|5.0|It \\"don't get not better\\" than Stevie, and these are all her best tracks on video!!
B0007VCZ50|4.0|I used to watch this video on VHS with bandmates years ago!  Its good fun.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|I think my title says it all...<br /><br />George's sprituality may not be everyone's idea of a good listen but the texture of the songs and overall vibe must be appreciated.  Thank the gods that Phil Spector didn't muddy this record up!!!<br /><br />Pete Ham is featured as an on-call guitarist during these sessions.  Once again proving that Pete was his favorite Badfinger guy.<br /><br />Videos, well anything on video (even cartoon drawings) are appreciated because of the subject matter.  Not earth-shaking but enjoyable to see.
B00005ASGG|4.0|The first time I saw \\"The Man who shot Liberty Valance\\" was on TCM.I was amazed at the casting of this fine old western and decided to buy it for my library of old movies.  I was not disappointed.  John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, along with Lee Marvin made this far better western than most movies were in it's day!   It is fun to see all of these actors in their prime, doing what they do best!   Thumbs up!!
032147404X|4.0|This book was very enjoyable and worth the money but it left me wanting so much more.  I need to buy a book with more details.
B000LE1GVW|4.0|I saw this guy on the Today show, then the Tonight show. Love his music - and I really hope he finds success. I like his style, like his writing, like his singing.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This documentary (Sir David is better than Sigorney Weaver by far) is fantastic.  It takes you across the globe to remote locations never before available on film.  The unique footage is often even better than that from Blue Planet (another gem.)  If you enjoyed Blue Planet or like watching beautiful film of nature and the world's creatures than Planet Earth is certainly for you.
B00000JXVK|5.0|If you're already a motorcyclist, this movie is guaranteed to make you smile and yearn for a good ride.  If you're not yet a motorcyclist, this movie might just turn you into one.  Yes it's a bit dated, but that's half it's charm.  Bruce Brown and son Dana make amazing movies, and On Any Sunday is typical of their laid back, well narrated, good time style.  If you like this don't miss Step Into Liquid and From Dust To Glory.  If you ride and this movie isn't on your video shelf, buy it now so you don't have to face the embarassment of telling you're riding buddies you don't know who Harvey Mushman is.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great Product! I would recommend Firefly to anyone who enjoys Starwars, StarTrek, or just enjoys a good show!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|If there's such a thing as magic this movie is it. Lots of cool racing scenes and good interaction with adults and the kids in this movie.  Though I don't believe in Santa I do recommend seeing this movie. Your children will love it, mine did!
B00004RD54|5.0|Yeah, I know it's Alice Cooper's live band - who do you think Alice learned it from? The intro to \\"Sweet Jane\\" is every garage band's dream. I have this on vinyl - I'm digitizing it as I type this - and this is the sound of the dark side of getting high and walking on the wild side - and it's live! One of the best live albums, from a musician who put his soul into it. You want formula? You won't get it here.
B000068TPN|5.0|Mel Gibson does it again, moving well above and beyond the \\"typical\\" expectations of the war movie genre.  There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said about the story itself.  I would just say that the great strength of this film lies in its focus on the soldiers as real people, with real lives, real families, real personalities, etc.  Gibson did an excellent job of emphasizing the emotional and psychological trauma of war, both for those in the battle and those waiting at home for news.<br /><br />This production was gritty, realistic and hard-hitting, similar to the Private Ryan/Band of Brothers standard for graphic portrayal of war violence.  Actors like Gibson, Kinnear, and Moore gave extemely believable performances, with Harris Pepper's character only marginally less convincing.  Finally, I enjoyed the absence of political commentary or moralizing about the war overall.  The only criticism that came across was directed toward the military leaders who put the 7th Cav. in that position in the first place.  Beyond that, Gibson just told it like it was.  Very well done indeed.
1573223026|5.0|from the first line you get caught by the story and want to know more.  Nick Hornby is a genius at switching from one person's point of view to the next.  He creates a more than unusual encounter between people that seem to have nothing in common.  the dialogues are fast, funny and sarcastic... i loved it!
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I thought I would have a hard time growing to love another Scissor Sisters album as much as I loved their first one. Now that I've been immersed in it for a few weeks, I have to say that I am more in love with the group than ever! Their sound varies a bit from the first album - less songs that sound like an overlooked Elton John track from the 70's, (although the flavors of EJ can still be found intertwined in several songs);  still a good bit of Bee Gees. But new to the mix are traces of Blondie and Queen. Just fantastic stuff, with the perfect Scissor Sisters twist of originality.    While I could review each track independently, let me focus on my current 2 favorites. \\"Kiss You Off\\" should be every woman's theme song, whether she is happily partnered (as I am) or not. It's a righteously angry, sexy-woman song. \\"Land of a Thousand Words\\" is a ballad worthy of comparing to last album's \\"Mary\\" in beauty of both arrangement and vocals.    Ta-Dah is as musically diverse and intelligent as the first album. It's also got the quintessential Scissor Sisters cutting wit, irony (e.g., cheerily reminding us that we were \\"born to die\\"), and daring musicality. With this album, they have solidified my adoration and have made me a fan for life. Now if we could only get them to tour more in the U.S.!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This movie rocks. It's basically an animated movie, somewhat in the American style of Anime (but not Animation, i.e. cartoons). The unique point is the fact the whole movie is pretty much synced up with Daft Punk's Discovery album which in itself is pretty awesome. There are no voices, the whole story tells itself visually and with the music. I love it, I've watched it many times myself, and my children who are 10 months, 3, and 4 (boy, girl, boy) also love it, whenever I play it on my pc or tv, my kids come running, they stop screaming, stop running around, stop hitting each other, and will just stand or sit, pretty much memorized and watch the entire movie that way. There are just so many vibrant colors and the music again, is great.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Old School will go down as an all-time classic comedy!  Love Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell.  There wasn't enough Will Ferrell, but that's what made his parts so great.  Great movie!  A must have for anyones collection.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana has one of the greatest voices in the jazz biz.  She plays a great piano, sings as a song bird, and is truly a marvelous performer.   (Cute too.)    Buy this one. If you like jazz, it is a Must in your portfolio/collection.
B000002UDB|5.0|Instant Classic is an overused cliche', but it describes this CD accurately.  This CD is a must for any Beatle fan.  It continues to show the Beatles were leaders in creative song writing and production, taking studio work to a whole different level.
B000A6T262|5.0|I have seen all the movies before but with the extras it is a new expeience.
0634022296|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this songbook.  But let me just say it was/is beyond my expectation.  It has every song you can imagine.  It shows exactly how each chord is supposed to be played ([...] wise)....Lennon and McCartney did not believe in typical chords, they obviously liked to add something almost each time.  It's been a blast to play songs that I never could've picked up otherwise because of some of the special chording.  I highly recommend this!
6305882592|5.0|Ok, so like 272 people have had wonderful things to say about this film and what more could I possibly add to the discussion?  This movie has over the years fed my soul and \\"reason to be\\".  It is a beautiful reminder that after all the education and family and work stuff there are still other reasons to remain here.  To choose to live.  As imperfect as it all is.  As sad as our mortality can make us.  Life has an aspect to it that is so rich, so lovely, so enchanting, so alluring, that, provided we are capable to slowing down long enough to take a good look at it, can be loved and embraced and followed, like a moth following a candle.  Finding yourself wasn't just a sixties slogan, it had to do with letting go of those things we think are important, so that we might truly begin to embrace those things that are essential to happines and to life.  Harold and Maude is about all that and more.  And as Forest Gump once said, \\"That's all I have to say about that.\\"
B000002UAX|5.0|Wow...this brings back great memories.  The songs are so diverse and unusual, showing their true talent and creative song writing abilities.  The songs are fun and strange all at the same time.  It is one of my favorites of the Beatles.  When you can have \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" in one package....what more can you ask!
0316789720|3.0|I was disappointed that the inside drawings looked just like the cover drawings... duh, I suppose, but I was expecting more.  I gave it to the 9-year-old 'patient' anyway, but wasn't excited about doing so.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I feel that Kelly Clarkson has gotten better with every CD. Thankful showed promise with her powerful vocals, but really, it sounded much like her American Idol stuff - like \\"A Moment Like This.\\" There were a couple of departures, like the Avril-esque \\"Low,\\" but \\"Low\\" had a riff that was like a weaker copy of Avril's \\"Losing Grip.\\" Breakaway was an album of strong pop/rock songs, ranging from the R&B-ish \\"Walk Away\\" to the folkish ballad \\"Where Is Your Heart\\" to the power pop sensation \\"Since U Been Gone.\\"    It would be hard to top Breakaway, but with My December, Kelly Clarkson has done it. It starts out with the angry rocker \\"Never Again.\\" That song, the industrial-dance song \\"One Minute,\\" and the jamming-out \\"Hole\\" are harder but different than anything she's done. \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is a pop song that sounds the most like Breakaway, and is just as good as much on that CD. \\"Maybe\\" is a mid-tempo song that sounds a bit like one of Fleetwood Mac's more off-the-wall songs. \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" is an rocker that builds to a fine crescendo. \\"Sober\\" is a spare ballad that lets her show off her voice. \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Irvine\\" are also haunting ballads. In fact, haunting is a word that can be used to describe the whole CD. Haunting due to the emotion Kelly puts into every word, and due to the melodies that seem to go into the ear and right to the soul. Think how \\"Addicted\\" from Breakaway had a drawn out melody that made sure that every word was made for maximum emotional appeal. That's the kind of feeling I get on My December. The album holds together well as a whole like Breakaway does, but My December has more variety. More strings are found, including violin, and there is more diverse guitar playing. Breakaway had a departure with the wall of guitar found on \\"Hear Me.\\" But on My December, guitars slam (\\"Hole\\" and \\"Judas,\\") get helped by computer generation (\\"One Minute,\\") jangle (\\"Don't Waste My Time,\\") and are head-bobbing (\\"How I Feel.\\")    Lyrically, there areoften very poetic, personal lyrics on My December. These lyrics fit the mood of the CD perfectly. Kelly has developed as a writer, exploring darker themes but not getting mired in sorrow. On Hole, she writes:    \\"Secrets  Eating at the core of me  Shut off  Trusting all the lies I breathe\\"    And on \\"Sober,\\" she writes:    \\"Three months and I'm still sober  Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers  But I know it's never really over\\"    Also, these lyrics really lay her thoughts out without the cliches that many a song about love have used. Not that there aren't familiar themes, but Kelly has a way of making those familiar themes sound lived through and fresh. You can admire the lyrics even if you've never been in the same situation, but often people will relate to them. One song that many could relate to is \\"Don't Waste Your Time,\\" which explores the old theme of a lover trying in vain to keep a relationship going. Sample lyrics from \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" -    \\"Don't waste your time trying to fix  What I want to erase  What I need to forget  Don't waste your time on me my friend  Friend, what does that even mean  I don't want your hand  You'll only pull me down  So save your breath  Don't waste your song  On me, on me  Don't waste your time\\"    The only weak spot on the CD is \\"Yeah.\\" It's a funky song that completely lacks direction. It seems to be added as the obligatory funk track. The album also could have used a song to lighten the mood up more. But even though there might not be anything as immediate musically on My December as \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" based on this very strong CD, I think that many fans will follow her on her musical journey. I'm already anxious to see what Kelly comes up with next.
B000O178BY|4.0|this is like going back to the beginning. when trent and company strained their anger and frustrations out of every song.
1594489505|4.0|I had previously read The Kite Runner and enjoyed it very much, so was very happy to buy and read another book by Mr. Hosseini.  He did not let me down, I throughly enjoyed the book.

B000P2A24W|2.0|I'm really not sure where I even start with this album...it seems like Jon and Richie are just lost and don't know how to make good music any more.  Apparently, commercial success is more important to them than good music nowadays.  Nothing like jumping on the country bandwagon and riding it for every dollar you can!  The past two Bon Jovi albums have been serious missteps...and this one is no different.  It sounds just like you think it would...Bon Jovi trying to do modern country.  The sad thing is that most of these songs will be huge hits...if not by Bon Jovi, then by the next no-talent country \\"star\\" who covers them.  The inclusion of Big and Rich...the ultimate in a long line of country \\"artists\\" who couldn't write their way off a blank sheet of paper only further negates from Bon Jovi's attempt at a legit record.  Poor effort all around...
B000O77RL4|1.0|Not really that happy with the dvd. I have a new small flat screen hd tv and was not able to play the dvd as the format was not the same. not sure why as the t v i had was new. I am sorry i bought the movie, was not in english and the words on the screen were to low to read so didnt understand most of the movie.I have not tried it yet on my large hd tv
B000PTYP5C|3.0|I'll admit: I just got into Dream Theater a few years ago, but I have all of their CDs and have listened to each ad nauseum.  It was interesting to hear the band progress throughout the years and really embrace the \\"progressive\\" part of \\"progressive metal.\\"  \\"6 Degrees\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" were truly high points where they took the songwriting -- especially the lyrics -- very seriously, and weren't just adding an extra beat to a measure here and there and calling it \\"progressive.\\"  <br />  <br />Somehow they've back-slid with \\"Systematic Chaos.\\"  It feels like a handful of musical ideas carelessly Scotch-taped together and overlaid with what I would consider embarrassingly adolescent lyrics about vampires, \\"Dark Masters,\\" and other subjects that seem to be almost a parody of the early Black Sabbath days, when the whole devil-worshipping idea was already laughable.  <br />  <br />One track -- \\"Constant Motion\\" -- stands out as one of their best works to date.  Petrucci delivers what I consider to be one of the best guitar solos in rock music.  But after that high point, the rest of the CD lays flat.  <br />  <br />There's no way I could play \\"Systematic Chaos\\" for anyone interested in hearing Dream Theater for the first time, not only because the music feels somewhat uninspired, but because the lyrics would elicit a response of \\"what's with all this teenage Goth crap?\\"  <br />  <br />It's too bad they didn't continue down the high road they'd started on with \\"6 Degrees\\" and \\"Octavarium.\\"  I was expecting \\"Systematic Chaos\\" to take the band to a new level.  <br />  <br />Maybe next time.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Incredible.  Shocking.  Heart-wrenching.  Bloody.  Violent.  Amazing.  This movie is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end.  This is definitely a \\"revenge\\" movie on all fronts.      During the movie the hunter becomes the hunted.  There are surprise twists and turns that are truly shocking.  This is actually a movie within a movie and it will definitely surprise the hell out of the first time viewer.      This is not a movie for those who have weak stomaches.  There is such strong violence and gore -- yet it is essential to the movies plot and various sub-plots.  THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.    I gave OLDBOY 5 stars.  There is so much going on in the movie and it is all tied together so neatly at the end that it just amazed me.  The acting is great, the storyline is great.  It is an intense action movie that will absolutely thrill any one who enjoys revenge movies.
0375413405|5.0|On the cover of this hardcover classic is the following statement: \\"The only cookbook that explains how to create authentic French dishes in American kitchens with American foods\\".  I think this was key to the success of this cookbook; you could use what you could find and not have to scour the earth for the right ingredients.<br /><br />I was looking at the copyright on the book. My mother gave me hers about two decades ago; but the original date on her edition was October 16, 1961 (amazing) and this book is every bit as useful for me today as it was for my mother.<br /><br />The chapters are laid out as follows:<br /><br />Kitchen Equipment<br />Definitions<br />Ingredients<br />Measures<br />Temperatures<br />Cutting<br />Wines (offering the right accompaniment to each dish)<br />Chapter I - Soups (onion, potato, cream of sorrel, cabbage, fish)<br />Chapter II - Sauces (white, brown, tomato, hollandaise, vinagrettes, etc.)<br />Chapter III - Eggs (poached, shirred, scrambed, omelettes)<br />Chapter IV - Fish (even recipes from Provence)<br />Chapter V - Poultry (roasted, casserole, sauteed, duck and goose, etc.)<br />Chapter VII - Meat (beef, lamb, veal, ports , kidneys)<br />Chapter VIII - Vegetables (greens, carrot, cabbages, etc)<br />Chapter IX - Cold Buffet (aspics, mousses, pates, etc.)<br />Chapter X - Desserts and Cakes (souffles, tarts, savarins, and much more)<br /><br />The recipe for the bouillabaisse alone (page 52 and 53) is well worth investing in this cookbook.  Julia Child knew what she was doing and the adaptation of these classic techniques to the American kitchen is stunning.  I noticed that there was a paperback available as well; the hardcopy is the one that I would get so that it could stand the test of time like mine has.  Bon appetit.<br /><br />Bentley/2007<br /><br />[[ASIN:0375413405 Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume One]]

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Everyone knows by now the problems that Clarkson has had with this disc -- well, the problems the higher ups have had with letting Clarkson have her own voice on record. But this is nothing new. In the world of \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" Clarkson had the guts to tinker with what worked. A poppy, melody written style that sucked in everyone who had ears. Did the change do her good? Yes-yes-yes. Is her album perfect? No. Who has made a perfect album? Not a dang soul out there.    What makes this album work so well. Is that Clarkson is TRYING!!!! Trying so hard not to be some cookie, cutter waif, with bleach blonde hair, kohl rimmed eyes, and a snarky attitude. The woman has substance. Songs like \\"Sober,\\" with it's build up to an almost necessary rant is just plain talent!!! The disc pops with tracks that show a woman in transition. The contemplative \\"Irvine\\" with its hollow melody and Patty Griffin like simplicity is marvelous and Clarkson can drudge out a sour note like no other popstar on the market.    Clive Davis offered her a truck load of money to put more \\"sellable\\" songs on the disc and she chose not too -- again, guts! Clarkson is growing as a sonwriter. And its bumpy for her. Her lyrics, at times, are too simple, but when they hit the right mark --  she tells a relatebale story. A girl/becoming a woman in a world where she's feeling a lot less secure. When Clarkson sings: \\"Let it go ...\\" on \\"Be Still\\" there is a quiet pain in what she sings, a great connection to the lyric.     Guts alone to take a chance on your own vision as an artist should merit you credit. But when you work at it and it comes out as solid as Clarkson's \\"My December,\\" you want to stand and cheer for the girl. She nails it. Daivs must also be a little deaf, if \\"Yeah\\" with its shout-back chorus and \\"One Minute\\" aren't radio friendly hits -- I don't know what is.    Congrats on, so far, having the best album of the year, Ms. Clarkson!
0792839749|4.0|The music is great -- I enjoyed singing along.  There are a lot of laughs and some clever surprises.  Maybe a bit overdone in spots (emphasis on the fact that the kids weren't in school because they didn't want to be, and the \\"goblin\\" character with the silly nose), but all in all it kept my attention from beginning to end.  I look forward to watching it again.
B00000IMYA|5.0|Perhaps that isn't a totally fair statement but rock and roll meant the end of the big band era.  Here the Ellington band got back together after a short hiatus and produced some great music.  I like the Newport Suite and the standards.  Jimmy Hamilton, an underrated clarinetist, is very impressive.  And of course, Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Clark Terry and Britt Woodman contribute great solos.  Diminuendo in Blue and Crescendo in Blue is exciting but the solo by Paul Gonsalves has always been overrated.  If you want to hear a great extended tenor sax solo in concert, listen to Rahsaan Roland Kirk on Perdido with Charles Mingus at Carnegie Hall.  This aside, there is much to like here and things were never the same again.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|After a long wait, the vocally superb original American Idol releases her highly anticipated third CD - and she does not disappoint. There has been so much dispute and negative buzz about this album that it seems difficult to tune it all out while listening to the CD. By the time you reach the fifth track, all doubts are erased.     Kelly starts the album off with three upbeat tracks that will get your heart pumping, and it is worth noting that track three - \\"Hole\\" is hands down the best rock song attempted by a female artist in recent years. Kelly proves she will not be placed in any specific genre because she can pull just about anything off. The CD then slows down briefly with track four - \\"Sober\\" - which is a moving experience all in itself. The track starts off slow and Kelly's vocals are breathy and gorgeous, and then the track picks up to a truly AMAZING finish - \\"Three months and I'm still breathing/Three months and I still remember it/Three months and I wake up\\" - it is at this point in the song when the listener's jaw drops as Kelly displays a new side of her upper register and proves just why she is one of the best in the world.     \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is a light pop song which has some nice lyrics to it and I feel many people will be able to relate to this song. While it isn't spectacular like many other tracks on the album, it is still better than many songs on Top 40 radio these days, and that just goes to show how artistic and classy this album actually is. \\"Judas\\" is another rocker which showcases Kelly's angry side once again - but I have to say I love the angry Kelly! \\"Haunted\\" seems like it could fit beautifully on an Evanescence album, but for now I guess we can only hope somewhere Amy Lee is out there taking notes.     \\"Be Still\\" is a stunning ballad where Kelly sings about staying in this moment forever, so to speak. It may not seem that great to the younger crowd, but truly is a gem on \\"My December\\".    \\"Maybe\\" just might be Kelly's most sophisticated track to date. It is lyrically wonderful and Kelly's vocals shine and the song is simply dripping with emotion. \\"How I Feel\\" and \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" are both great tracks that would sound great on radio. \\"How I Feel\\" reminds me of No Doubt and surely will please the ears of many listeners and No Doubt fans.     Kelly saves one of the most stunning songs I have ever heard for last. \\"Irvine\\" is lyrically brilliant, and serves as a prayer to a higher being while Kelly feels small and helpless. The lack of production on this song really makes it perfect - and I hardly use the word perfect. As you really listen to this song, you can't help but get sucked into the emotion and feel like you are the one in deep emotional pain. If anyone questions the artistry of Kelly Clarkson - I urge them to listen to this song. It is highly personal, and vocally outstanding in the way it is so simply sung, but very vocally complex. Kelly finishes the emotional roller coaster that is \\"My December\\" with the hidden track \\"Chivas\\". It is a fun song that sounds like Kelly was drunk in a bar while singing it, and it serves as a great hidden track to make the listener laugh.     Overall, I would give this album 4 1/2 stars out of 5. I do not believe any album is perfect, but I believe Kelly has outdone herself and come pretty close. \\"My December\\" is definitely a grower, it may not hit you the first time you listen to it. I strongly suggest giving the album a few listens, and it is then that you will find it very difficult to turn off. There aren't many albums I can say I like almost every single song on, but this is definitely one of them. Kelly has cemented herself as a true artist and is well on her way to becoming a legend. She proves that while no other American Idol can vocally come near her, it is okay because there aren't too many in the world who really can.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly amps up the rock in her third and most versatile CD from the hard driving never again and the awesome remixes by Dave Aude also check the one friom Jason Nevins:) I love her club/dance remixes too! This CD blew me away Kelly lets it all hang out and in true awesome Kelly style:) Her ballad Sober is beautiful and the mid temp rockers such as Can I have This Kiss and One Minute and Yeah amd How I feel are all catchy and yet deep at the same time:) Clive Davis in spite of his dumping all over Kelly will be shown that this young woman is here to stay and then some! I predict a huge number one CD with multi-platinum sales and more Grammy's:) Kelly you will tour again & sell them all out girlfriend! You rock Dont ever chanfge I saw you in concert in July 2005 and was blown away! Youre the best out there! Rock on!

006097625X|5.0|Eso es lo que es este libro. A lo largo de sus 9 capitulos, se toman en cuenta partes sumamente importantes en la estructura de un comic, llendo mas alla de la calidad y el estilo del dibujo. Como dice el autor, este libro es su opinion y espera a partir de el, se debata el contenido y no solo se de por hecho. Sin duda un excelente libro al nivel de \\"El comic y el arte secuencial\\" de Will Eisner, con la diferencia mas relevante, de estar formado como un comic, no un libro de teoria con ejemplos de comic.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I think this album is really good. yes, some of the rumors are true, it is dark and there aren't as many classified hits as Breakaway, but it is an artist growing into her own. Kelly co wrote all the songs on the album and while the writing is good, there is still room to grow in that department.  There are plenty of songs that aren't as dark,and that aren't as rock oriented for example maybe, be still, irvine the secret bonus track chivas and one minute is a very pop/rock sounding track. Overall the best songs that you MUST hear are sober (the new single), Haunted, Irvine (great acoustic song), Be still (slower ballad), and Dirty little secret(bonus track on itunes). There are some filler songs that aren't great for example Yeah and can i have this kiss, but they are limited. The album shows a star in the making even if her label doesn't like the supposed non radio songs. The album is creating great reviews from magazines and newspapers. Listen and see the voice of the future. Kelly's voice is amazing and so is her range. It isn't all rock as the rumor was spread either. Kelly has true emotion on this album, which sometimes lacked on previous albums Thankful and Breakaway.
1594489505|5.0|My review is short.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book - couldn't put it down.  I found it an inciteful view of what life is really like for women and children in present day Afghanistan.

B000JX1HU0|1.0|Bill Bryson's book MOTHER TONGUE has an admirable goal, to present the evolution and current state of the English language in a simple and intriguing fashion. However, it is a book full of factual errors. On nearly every page this is an urban myth, folk etymology, or misunderstanding of linguistics.<br /><br />Bryson writes charming travelogues - THE LOST CONTINENT is a book I'd recommend to any foreigner wanting to learn about rural America - but he is an amateur with an interest in wordplay and not a professional linguist. Much of the book appears to have been thrown together from older books on language for the popular reader, especially those of Otto Jespersen, Mario Pei, and Montagu, which themselves have been criticized for errors and oversimplications.<br /><br />The errors of the book astound from the start any reader with the slightest knowledge of language.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I'm more of a casual Kelly fan, just because I think she has a beautiful voice. I was really worried that I wouldn't like the dark tones of the CD, and yes it has them, but despite all the dark tones it seems to me that Kelly is saying I've been through crap, but at the end of the day I've moved on and it is almost an inspirational album. The standouts for me are: Sober, Can I Have a Kiss, How I Feel, Judas, and Irvine you can skip over Yeah, and the whole album will be like a treat to your ears.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Amidst a maelstrom of controversy, veteran megastar Kelly Clarkson delivers her much-anticipated project `My December.' A follow-up to her astronomically-successful six-time platinum `Breakaway,' `December' is Clarkson's most original work yet. Considering Clarkson wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, it is fair to say `December' is also her most personal record thus far.    On `December,' Clarkson further develops the pop/rock sound she featured on `Breakaway,' though the intensity is ratcheted up tenfold. This is apparent on songs such as \\"Haunted,\\" \\"Hole,\\" and \\"Never Again\\" (the album's first single). In fact, Clarkson's newfound rocked-out sound is drawing comparisons to Alanis Morissette and Janis Joplin.    Also found on `December' are indie blues and soul tracks like \\"Be Still,\\" \\"Yeah,\\" and \\"Irvine,\\" which strengthen Clarkson's songwriting credentials and her knack for recording true music rather than disposable radio filler. \\"Yeah\\" in particular is a step away from what she is used to recording thanks to its jazziness, but she manages to pull it off. \\"Irvine\\" is a true classic and is a compliment to indie rock. It is also the most unique track on `December' thanks to its lazy, daydream-esque sentiment, though it doesn't seem out of place.    `December' also includes the second-best song Clarkson has ever written and recorded in \\"Sober,\\" an account of a woman declaring her resiliency after a break-up. \\"Sober\\" is second only to \\"Because of You,\\" which will remain Clarkson's most heartfelt song to date. The final chorus represents an emergence from sullenness to confidence as Clarkson's vocals soar to emotional heights.    Despite the raw, more sincere sound on `December,' there are still some catchy tracks that would  fit on radio stations' playlists with relative ease like \\"One Minute\\" and \\"How I Feel.\\" The verses on \\"Minute\\" are just as fun to sing along to as the chorus is, and the funky background music on \\"Feel\\" gives it a current touch.    `December' does not have a universally-accepted \\"weak\\" song on it, though \\"Judas\\" is a little on the bland side and can get lost in the shuffle with the superior hard-edged \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" and \\"Can I Have a Kiss.\\" Not to be missed is the quirky hidden track \\"Chivas,\\" in which Clarkson's lyrics are humorous at times.    `My December' is a masterpiece; a testament to true artistry, and it cements Clarkson's position as an artist and not just another popstar. It is true not everyone loves her new sound, but that will not change the fact that `December' is Clarkson to the core. This project will not be met with the commercial success that its predecessor received, but that is the last thing Clarkson is concerned with.    The fact remains that Clarkson's growth and maturity are present on `My December' and it will always be a chapter in her musical career, one that will be looked back on as a great decision for years to come.

6300181286|4.0|Frankenstein, 1931 film<br /><br />This 'Revised Version' film begins with a burial. The grave is filled in. Two men dig up the coffin in the now empty graveyard. Then they cut down a hanged man; but this body is useless. A medical school compares the brains of an intelligent man to a foul criminal. Will the servant pick the right brain for Dr. Henry Frankenstein? Is he testing the boundaries of science and sanity? Frankenstein's fiancee worries about Henry. His teacher Dr. Waldman explains the problem with Henry - he wants to experiment on humans! Is this excessive optimism of megalomania? [There is no explanation why a new brain is needed for a body. Unless its for dramatic purposes.] The visitors arrive unexpectedly. \\"Crazy am I? We'll see tonight.\\" Frankenstein discovered a new ray that gives life! The storm will generate enough electricity to power the experiment. \\"Its alive!\\"<br /><br />Herr Vogel the Burgomeister visits Baron Frankenstein to ask about the scheduled marriage. Why is Henry waiting? The teacher warns Henry about what can happen. The monster makes a dramatic entrance. [They used short sleeves to suggest extra long arms.] The monster has a fear of flames. Fritz teases the monster one time too many. The plan to kill the monster fails. Dr. Waldman's plan to terminate the monster fails. So now the monster runs loose! Meanwhile the preparations for the marriage creates happiness in the village. Young Maria meets the monster, things go terribly wrong! Henry's bride has a premonition that something will go wrong. The monster is near. Maria's father asks for justice. The villagers go out to search for the monster. [They are not armed! How will they stop the monster?] Herr Frankenstein finds the monster. Will the villagers get there in time? The monster seeks refuge in an old windmill. The villagers add lighting. [The unnamed actor give life to the monster's death.] There seems like a happy ending for the Frankensteins.<br /><br />The story of a man-mademonster terrorizing the country must have resonated with people during the Great Depression. A number of sequels were filmed with other monsters: vampires, and wolfmen. Then they ended by 1945. Future horror films would use other creatures.
B000P2A256|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  I almost thought about buying a couple more copies just so that I wouldn't have to take the one I bought in and out of my cd players (car, home, work, friends, etc.).

B000JJRIN4|5.0|I originally bought this cd simply for the song \\"Sweet Escape\\".  However, this entire cd is great.  Some of the songs have a very driving beat while others are much more mellow.  Truly awesome cd.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This combines a group of movie clips that both the musical lover AND those who things musicals are \\"dumb\\" will enjoy. The clips where the musical stars are doing what they do best is the best of the best; the clips where the actors are attempting to sing is some of the best compilation footage out there today, and a real laugh! It provides a glipse into what was one of the great motion picture studios in the history of Hollywood (California), and a tribute to those people who created the foundation for a medium that sometimes gets lost in trying spread a message. This collection pays homage to a time when movies weren't out to change the world, but to make the world a better place if even for only a few hours at a time.    For years, this has been something that people had wanted on DVD, but it took almost 25 years for this to make it into DVD format, and with that, the print is excellent. However, don't be worried that your DVD player is in the wrong mode (widescreen or 4:3): it is how the movie was shot. Remember: there was a time when widescreen did not exist, and this shows us what happens when you widen the screen for more picture AND more sound.    Some of the greatest stars ever to grace a movie screen are in this collection: Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland (known as the biggest star MGM created by historians), Mickey Rooney (truly one of the film industry's finest actors), Lena Horne, Ava Gardner, Jimmy (James) Stewart, Liza Minelli, Clark Gable and so many others. The moments with Clark Gable trying to sing and dance make you glad he decided not to do it anymore; it was wartime (World War II), and many of the folks were off fighting the war.    Growing up, the movies this collection features in its clips were films that were only seen on television in showcases like \\"The Million Dollar Movie\\" and such, with black-and-white televisions at first, then color sets. Because MGM did their best to make sure this collection was thorough andcomplete, when a movie is in widescreen (Cinescope), it is presented that way ... unlike that of the modern day pan-and-scan film edits we see on TV today.    If you have young children, I believe this is a bit of history in Hollywood that even they will enjoy, especially if they enjoy more of the standard, mellower music of our times. The songs that were introduced by these films are now considered standards, and have stood the test of time, unlike so much of what we hear today. Though we've progressed in so many ways, the phrase, \\"They don't write 'em like that anymore\\" really does apply to the music in these clips.    In a day and age when Hollywood is rediscovering the power of the movie musical, perhaps the directors and producers, as well as cinemetographers, can look to these films as something that has endured a test of time, and was proven effective in helping the world when it was so much in need of cheering-up. Remember the old song: \\"Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy ... \\" This film collection will make even the crabbiest person smile, if for only a little while.    For more historical information on MGM, and the rise and near collapse of the studio, I recommend the series, \\"When the Lion Roared\\" --- you and your kids can learn a lot for it.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is by far Kelly's best work to date. Each song is dripping with emotion that will leave the listener feeling SOMETHING... Its an album that stays with you long after you hear it.     Standout tracks include:  Hole  Judas  SOBER  Haunted  How I Feel  Be Still  Irvine   (and the hidden track) Chivas
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album had so much negativity surrounding it, that some people wouldn't even give it a chance. I am SO happy Kelly took a chance and put HER album out there. I am so happy she didn't record based on anything being \\"radio friendly,\\" and I am even happier she didn't feel the need to release a more positive album. In my opinion, the album is not negative. It is refreshing and inspiring. It tells us that we can have the worst of times and get through it. We aren't alone. It is truly amazing.    Her vocals are amazing as always and her lyrics are beautiful. The emotion she has in her songs is remarkable.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love this CD.  Perhaps its my love of old music or Michael Buble's wonderful voice!  I highly recommend this.
1932100660|5.0|one of the best books i've ever read! a must read for anyone taking health seriously!
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I received two complete sets (one replacing the other) because the first disk, first show, first series etc., started in the middle of the third season...both original sets sent to me.  You could not watch show number 1, season number 1 because the disks were not in any order and to give them to my 84 year mother who loves the show and tell her that they aren't in order but go ahead and enjoy them, was not going to work...so I'm hoping I receive my money back because I have sent both complete sets back.
B000002NIW|4.0|I haven't listened to this CD in years and when I mean years I mean since 1999, and I had only really listened to 1 song... My own summer, it wasn't until the b-sides cd was released and I watched the clip for 'Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)' I had a renew interest in the album. Upon first listen I was blown away, each song well crafted, full of angst and clever lyrics. After repeated listen's especially the ace 'Head Up' on high rotation, I could see the formula that has been ripped off from countless other 'Nu Metal' bands ***cough*** Linkin Park ***cough***. At least the Deftones made it their own sound and have grown into what they are today...<br />Fav Tracks:<br />Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)<br />Head Up
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly won American Idol. Them came \\"Thankful\\" and \\"Breakaway\\". Now Kelly is on her way to become the best singer in the wolrd (I think she ist it at all). This album is absolutely wonderful !!! May be that there are some songs on this album which are not \\"radio friendly\\" but who cares. The storie told by this album ist fantastic and Kelly was so honorable to refuse a lot of money from here record label to put some itchy pitchy pop songs to it. Kelly - I will let you know: There are a lot of fans all over the world and here in Germany, too. Kelly ---> WE LOVE YOU!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I'll admit it: I was a little worried about Josh when Lullabies came out. Not that it was a bad record--it had some great moments. It was just... missing something... something essential. There was a sense of incompleteness on that record that many commentators (perhaps rightly, perhaps not) attributed to the departure of Nick. I try not to get to into that brand of armchair speculation.    Anyway. Just prior to my first spin of ERA VULGARIS, I tried to rid my psyche of all expectations and preconceived notions. I wanted to be as fair and objective as a walking hunk of meat could possibly be (under the circumstances).    Well, I have to say this is a monumental record--compositionally solid, sincerely delivered, and totally inspired. It's Josh's show and it shows. Punctuating the delightfully inventive riffing are some of the sharpest and most profoundly self-reflective lyrics he's ever caterwauled. Everything fits just right. Everything flows. I cannot stop listening to this record.    I listen to records not as collections of songs, but as albums--you know, 70s style. As such, I avoid the whole \\"standout tracks include x, y and z\\" kind of thing. A good album is more than the sum of its parts. That said, the only point at which this record dips into a slight lull is during the tenth track, \\"River in the Road\\". It's not awful, but it pales a bit in comparison with solidity of the rest of the disc. (Of course, the worst QOTSA tracks are still better than 99% of what's out there in the market today).    To sum up, this record is absolutely top notch--a very pleasant summer surprise. ERA VULGARIS has officially usurped Big Business' [[ASIN:B000MR9EUS Here Come the Waterworks]] (which is, by the way, a brilliant effing record) as Best Album of 07. For real.
0812550706|2.0|This book just left me wanting a little bit more.  The conflicts seemed contrived, the deceptions were weak and thinly veiled, and the twist was not really a twist at all but was pretty obviously there all along.    It might be possibly because I'm used to relatively intricate plots and developed characterizations and the author admittedly states the story is kept simple.  Perhaps it's because I read this book over 20 years after it was released.  It does have its good points, and I am a fan of Card's other works, but this one just kind of felt... juvenile.    The best part of the book was after the climatic \\"twist\\", when Ender goes out and about.  That part seemed to be the most intriguing part of the book, since there actually seemed like there would be drama and conflict instead of just Ender conquering obstacle after obstacle.    Perhaps, it's the Superman syndrome.  It is difficult to make a story interesting when the protagonist is basically, admitterdly, undefeatable.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I've looked forward to this release of Superman II for a while. Although I think Richard Donner's cut tells a more compelling story of the Man of Steel, I can see why the changes that were made for Lester's theatrical version. Also, one particular scene where they decided to take footage from the screen test (since the scene was never originally shot), looks out of place and breaks the flow of the movie. I understand Richard's intent, and it was a valiant attempt to show the scene as he envisioned it, but I'm not sure it was necessary. Anyway, the DVD is worth adding to your collection, especially if you're a fan of the first two Superman movies.
0679847367|5.0|We've begun to offer this book as part of a graduation gift because it has a nice message!  This specific product was especially nice because it was enclosed in a book 'case'.
0823013626|5.0|I've loved Donna Kato's work for some time, but while I've purchased several polymer clay \\"how-to\\" books in the three years I've been working with PC, this is the first of Ms. Kato's books I've purchased. It won't be the last.<br /><br />I received it today, and read through it, cover to cover.  My hands are itching to try the techniques she so generously and painstakingly shares. While other leading polymer clay artists sell these same techniques individually in seminars and on expensive DVDs, Ms. Kato has demonstrated several processes I've been hungry to learn in one place, in a beautiful, inexpensive and clearly written book.<br /><br />Hats off to Donna Kato!
1843104954|5.0|As a mother of a 10-year-old son with AS, I have read through this book once and am sure to be consulting it again and again.  I read many excellent reviews of the book, and I think they are right on.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Besides being shocked that Air was comprised of two MEN, I was also shocked at how much I ended up liking this record.  What hooked me originally was the wide range of sounds and electronic instrumentation layered throughout the various tracks (see especially \\"Surfing On A Rocket\\" and \\"Run\\") and I found the melodies to be very catchy.  The vocals are very gender-ambiguous (if that makes any sense...?), and many times are also synthesized.  I was raised on 80's synth-alternative like Depeche Mode, Yaz, OMD, etc. and this brought back a lot of good memories.  If you're in the same boat, I recommend picking this album up...might also wanna check out Zero 7's \\"When It Falls\\".
B000B7HZXM|4.0|as always rod  is fabulous. anything he does he does beautifully.it is a great album for those of us who appreciate  theseb classics.
B00005JPKE|4.0|Enjoyed the film.  Not many American Directors/Producers have the courage to present the view point of an opposing side especially in a war as unpopular as the Japanese were during WWII.  It is also difficult to get English speaking audiences to watch a movie with subtitles.  Multitasking must be tough for many of us.
B000LXHK22|3.0|Okay the good stuff first; lovely Provence, beautiful French girl and...well that's about it.  Brilliant director, acting talent galore unfortunately lumbered with plot and dialogue on the par with your average television sitcom.  This is like pairing a fine Bordeaux with a Big Mac.  Sadly it just won't do.  I got the feeling throughout the viewing that I was watching Ridley Scott's home movie of his summer holiday.    This is not to say Russell Crowe can't do comedy.  He is incredibly charming and seems to retain the boyish naughty boy quality which makes the girls hearts race, with a wink and a nod to all his fellow blokes on the other side of the screen.  One gets the sense he was having a grand time, but wasn't called on to do much acting.    Albert Finney and Russell Crowe together with a script worthy of their talents would be a real treat.  Maybe next time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is one of the best we have had.  The photography is awesome, there is beauty in every frame.  Stunning!  We love this series!
B00005O3VC|4.0|What is there to say about this, except that this is a classic.  Great extra stuff with the DVD and as usual a comical movie from beginning to end.  What you would expect form Monty Python.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|True confession time: I am hooked on Celtic Woman . . . and it's getting worse! Or should I say better? The first Celtic Woman album I bought was Chloe's Walking in the Air, then it was Meav's A Celtic Journey, and today I finally got the group's famous blow-out debut. Several of the tracks are also on Chloe's album, so I wasn't sure if I should get it, but I'm so glad I did. There are a lot of songs I haven't heard before, and even the one's that are on Chloe's CD have different arrangements and more of a Celtic flare here. Favorite tracks: 1) Walking in the Air, 2) May it Be (so beautiful, have never heard it before), 3) Orinoco Flow (I always heard of it as Sail Away -- was so delighted!), 4) The Soft Goodbye (warm and touching), 5) You Raise Me Up (an all time favorite, and the song they were singing on TV the moment I walked into my Grandparent's house and discovered this whole new world of music!). Celtic Woman is not just for fans of Celtic music. It is for anyone who appreciates beauty, culture, and inspiration. Celtic Woman, \\"May it be you'll journey on to light the day.\\"
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Great title for the whole family.  I didn't mind the \\"message\\" that was being conveyed.  Blu-Ray picture quality - magnificant!

0739341340|5.0|This was recommended on the blog of Thomas Nelson's president, and I am so glad he did! Whether you are creating a book proposal, or trying to come up with just the right title, or trying to figure out what angle is most \\"marketable,\\" this is must-reading (or listening, in this case).
6305212112|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. It's story touches your heart. I recommend it to everyone who likes the real thing. You can really get into this movie!
B000OVLBF8|3.0|If you're a fan of this comic book I guess you would enjoy the movie. I only gave it 3 stars because I like Nicolas Cage, and OMG is that Peter Fonda, I love Peter Fonda, ever since Easy Rider.  Sam Elliott makes a nice appearance too!
078322737X|3.0|I didn't care for this movie too much. It might be ok for teenagers but I doubt today's teenager would relate, it may seem kind of nerdy to them.
1594489505|5.0|If Kite Runner brought tears to your eyes and lump to your throat, then be prepared for more of the same. This is an exceptional read. I finished it in less than a day. It's one of those you cannot put down.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Some excellent mood music by David Gilmour for critical listenting.  This is not background music.    While listening to this one, I find it hard to get up and walk away.  And ... it's one of those cd's that the more you hear it, the more you like it.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I was never a Kelly Clarkson fan until this week. I didn't watch her on American Idol. I bought her first CD because I liked the single \\"A Moment Like This,\\" but wound up disliking the rest of the CD. Sure, I found all those Top 10 hits from Breakaway catchy, but they were just so sugary. There was no real emotion in them; it was blatantly obvious that they existed solely to become hits and sell CDs. After a while, \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" \\"Breakaway,\\" \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes,\\" and \\"Because of You\\" melted into one big, mindless pop song trying to cash in on the emo craze and simultaneously retain pop radio appeal. And while they did get stuck in my head, I refused to listen to them because they seemed so obviously manufactured.    Not so with this disc. I downloaded it when it leaked on the Internet, just to see if it was any better than Breakaway. At that time, I hadn't heard about the controversy surrounding the album, so I wasn't biased in Kelly's favor; if anything, I had exceedingly low expectations for the album. Instead, I fell in love with it at first listen.    These songs are overtly different. They're not trying to be bouncy summer radio sing-alongs. They're not trying to reel you in with catchy hooks and keep you satisfied with lightweight melodies and inconsequential lyrics. These songs are heartfelt and, at times, downright hardcore. The lyrics aren't world-changing, but they ring true, and their titles are blessedly devoid of cutesy intentional misspellings. My December may not be steak, but it's certainly more filling than Breakaway-esque cotton candy.    In fact, when I first listened to the album, it reminded me of nothing so much as Origin-era Evanescence: pre-Fallen, pre-fame, pre-studio gloss. Those songs were much less polished, and would never have survived on contemporary radio, but they were more raw, more real, and they possessed an emotional incandescence that was never matched by any of Evanescence's later material. One could conjure a mental image of the band actually writing, channeling, experiencing them. So it is with this disc.    After falling for this album, I watched Kelly's CMT special with Reba McEntire, and for the first time, I realized how immensely talented Kelly truly is. I never would have noticed had I not listened to this disc. I can now say that I am a true Kelly Clarkson fan, and I will be buying this CD on my next trip to Wal-Mart. There are very few artists whose albums I deem worthy of buying after sampling them online, but I believe that Kelly has earned my money and my support with this album, and I hope that it does extremely well for her.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|For die-hard fans of Alien, like me, this set is a godsend.  The bonus minutes on each disk really add to the story.  I was never a huge fan of Alien Resurrection but even the bonus features for this installment of the Alien legacy were awesome.<br />The minutes added to the first movie, Alien, shows what actually happened to Dallas and Brett.  The additional footage on Aliens shows Newt and her parents prior to the Alien invasion.  Alien 3 bonus footage adds more to the plot and suspense.  As for Alien Resurrection, like I said, wasn't one of the better Alien movies but any set wouldn't be complete without it.
0553382179|4.0|Very good book. lots of great ideas and full of inspiration.  but the quality of the book not so good. It fell apart. Its now in 3 pieces.
0316018953|5.0|Michael Connelly has been a personal favorite for many year. \\"The Poet\\" is and always will be in my top three books of all time. I would never in a million years miss a Harry Bosch book. Keep them coming.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|I've listened to this album at least once a day since its release a few weeks ago waiting for that moment when it grows on me. The last two QOTSA albums, particularly last, grew on me instantly and I couldn't stop listening to it. This one is not a rock album in my opinion. It's not 'cool'. Its certainly not catchy like the others are. I never once found myself singing along with Josh enjoying myself. The guitars are repetitive and thin. The drummer sounds like he was drunk for part of the recording. In fact, I find the majority of the tracks on this album to be annoying. So Im left with the question, what happened? I'll more than likely buy their next album hoping for a gem, but this lump of coal spend a lot of time on the shelf. Sad.
0393317552|1.0|If I could give this book negative 5 stars, I would.  This book is a world history hand job which has nothing to do with serious historical inquiry, and which will itself be looked back upon by future historians as an exquisite specimen of western bourgeois consciousness at the very height of its catharsis and hubris.  Jared Diamond is an ornithologist-turned-sudden-expert-on-everything-in-the-world who feebly attempts to capture the essence of history in facile, two-bit concepts such as the \\"onion skin\\" or \\"Yali's question.\\"  Real, documented, historical analytical exposition is replaced by little tidbits gleaned here and there from an actual history book and then quickly buried beneath long, windy passages of Jared's armchair musings on \\"why it was so.\\"  You can almost hear the game on in the background as these musings slowly peter out and reach no conclusion whatsoever.  The so-called \\"central thesis of the book\\" is a dumbed-down, oversimplified misrepresentation of critical responses to the long-defunct Social Darwinistic view of history (which, incidentally, is also dumbed-down as Jared reconstructs it), which Jared then abruptly proceeds to contradict on every page of his book.  Sentences like \\"Civilization is not created out of sheer will or intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions,\\" by which Jared means to move his argument forward, are tautologies which say absolutely nothing at all, perhaps even less than nothing.  Whatever the bird watcher may think he has achieved here, his book is in fact an argument FOR a Social Darwinistic interpretation of history (that history is shaped by racial superiority and so forth), not against it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|As soon as I saw the movie, I bought the score and I play it over and over.  I am not a musician, but all I can say is that the vocals are outstanding and listen to the lyrics - they are terrific.
0385522401|1.0|If your looking for insightful, intraspective, self-important blabbering in this review, warning:  don't read mine!  I tell it like I see it, with simplicity and straightforwardness.  I was very disappointed by this \\"short story\\".  I was so excited to read it because of the how much I enjoyed Atonement, and the great review this book received from NBC's Today Show, but was sadly disappointed.  I kept having to remind myself that this book was set in the 1960's, not the 1860's, as it seemed quite unbelievable.  Just plain dumb, and revoltingly/unneccessarily graphic descriptions where they just weren't needed.  Yuck-save your money and purchase A Thousand Splendid Suns instead!!!!!
B00006JDSI|5.0|For anyone interested in horror films, this is a must to add to your collection. The style has become the mold for countless generations of vampire movies, up to and including Bela Lugosi's version (His is the definitive modern version). The dark cinematography is enhanced by the otherworldly makeup. It's only after a few minutes that you realize that it is a silent movie, and you really don't care. A later remake with Klaus Kinski was made, but it hardly comes close, although it gets kudos for its homage to the original by keeping it as close to the original plot, with filler scenes added to make up for the short movie length. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
0679805273|5.0|This is the perfect and unique gift for anyone who has graduated from school, no matter what the age.
0374105235|5.0|When I first saw Ishmael Beah interviewed I thought he had a remarkable poise, a glowing presence. At that point, nerves from appearing on national television, added to the whirlwind of an intense book tour, added to the energy already generated by writing the book, on top of the huge relief of successfully fleeing the nightmare in Sierra Leone could explain all that poise and glow.  But I wondered if Beah was special... inspiring because he had unusual talents or an inner mission or vision that made him, his accomplishments and his message beyond the reach of mere mortals. So I read his book.     His direct unvarnished style, his humble honesty and the utter lack of a self-defense told me this first-time writer was indeed special.  But WHAT he wrote told me he was just a kid, caught up in yet another manmade hell, used and abused psychically and physically.  The difference between him and his friends who withered and perished or returned to \\"the life\\" after rehab was that he saw a ray of hope and reached for it, even when it could mean his imminent death.  He made a choice.  He mustered all his courage.  No excuses.  He was desperate.  He had nothing to lose. He never gave up.     Reading his assessment of his life I realized that he experienced trauma the same way many children experience it who have not been soldiers in a war, because there is a terrible sameness to man's inhumanity to man however it morphs into our lives.  And the reaction of a human soul to its challenge is always either surrender, fight, flee or go crazy.  I read about his confusion, his desire to run away, his despair and fear.  I recognized all the symptoms.  So I bought the book for a young friend, a woman in her 20's, who has been grappling with childhood sexual and psychological abuse.  I told her if he can come through THIS, perhaps it will give you hope that you, too, can come through your hell.      She read the book and felt a deep compassion for Ishmael Beah (...had it not been for the book, a man we might otherwise easily condemn for his brutality to his fellow man, in many cases, his brutality to his fellow children... I cringe to remember how some people treated U.S. soldiers returning from Vietnam, as if their age made them any less the victims of war as the drafted envoys of violence.)  This young woman KNEW what Beah was talking about, she who had never held a gun.  And she has taken strength from the connection she feels with him.    I would suggest giving this book to someone who is struggling with despair and fear and confusion, because it may help him or her to feel not so alone. As heavy as it is, this book will honor his or her dark exerience of life, and validate their own instincts about right and wrong and betrayal.  It may also inspire them to hope.  A LONG WAY GONE probably deserves a special occasion of its own rather than being a birthday or Christmas gift.  And it may require the promise of talks afterward to help a young person sort through it.  For adults who have experienced childhood trauma long since buried, it may be a wake up call to become their authentic selves.      And for the rest of us, who vote for the Congresspersons who can take our own youth into war, this is a must read (along with James Webb's FIELDS OF FIRE) if you have any doubt that war isn't a tolerable option.  I have a 19-year-old son and I can promise you his sensibilities are as innocent and fragile as the 12-year-old Beah's... only my son, and kids in high school, are considered fair game, cannon fodder to the leaders who have never read a book like this.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I bought this DVD for my mother as a birthday gift.  My mother and the Queen are approximately the same age, and my mother identifies with Elizabeth because of the time span they shared.  My mother thinks the movie is great and recommends it highly.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|I was absolutely unfamiliar with Grace Kelly's activities as an actor. Now I have avery good chance of it. I liked this particular movie very much. She is one of the most beautiful women in the entire world. I have red 2 books about Her Serene Highness, I think that she became a legend not only her fairy-tale wedding into the aristocracy, but also because she left show business on the peak of her famousness

B000QFCD2W|5.0|I just bought this gem and couldn't wait to listen to it, so I faked that I was working at the office and enjoyed the nightmarish atmosphere of King's latest opus.  Musically speaking, it is genius. Here you will find the riffs and melodies that you not only expect but demand from this fabulous band.  The story is where I feel like picking up the phone and calling him to demand an explanation: \\"So, Kim, what's up with the whole 'suicide misunderstanding'? And the end... are you leaving it open for a follow-up? you better...\\"  This is King's probably most atmospheric album where not a lot of action happens in the story, but a lot of scenes are described, with the help of the music, as always. And when I say \\"atmospheric\\", I don't mean soft new-age music. It is HEAVY, don't worry about that.  Now I just found out he's coming to Winnipeg on April 16, 2008... I almost pooped my pants! I saw him on the Voodo tour on the White Rabbit hole, down in San Antonio, and now he will bless this cold city with his music! YEAH!  GO BUY THIS CD.  (I usually download a lot of music, but NOT King's, not King's)  BUY IT!!!!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I love this album! Kelly has to be the best American Idol! She has been so successful in her music career. This album has very powerful, meaningful lyrics along with Kelly Clarkson's amazing voice! You just want to keep listening to it. My favorite songs on the album are Never Again, One Minute, Sober, Haunted and Yeah. If you love her like I do, go out and buy the album! You wont be disappointed!
1594489505|5.0|As soon as I finished this book, I sent it to my brother-in-law because I know he loves good books as much as I do.  This is a gripping and powerful story.  Certainly a book for our time - in terms of geography and politics.  So well writen.  A must read.    Janie O'Connor
1582701709|1.0|This is more like a Cliffs Notes than a book.  Some of the information is actually dangerous, like all you have to do is \\"think\\" yourself thin!  I find that chapter completely irresponsible.  I wonder how many people are going to die who have Diabetes or other obesity related afflictions which require more drastic action than \\"thinking\\"!  A huge disappointment, I am also disappointed in Oprah for featuring it and thus promoting it.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Antoine fuqua'a latest film shooter is a film of government conspiracy. Filled with action from the beginning to the end, the movie will keep you entertained. Mark wahlberg stars in the movie as an ex-marksman that gets framed in a murder plot. The story is very entertaining, and the cinematography is good. Danny glover stars as the villain and helps to provide depth to the plot. Overall this is a good movie to rent and also to own.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This CD is his best work yet.  Every song except one is outstanding.  The only one I didn't care for was Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight\\".  The cover songs and the orchestra sound behind him are awesome but the new songs he wrote are even better.  The CD is very well produced as you would expect from David Foster.  This guys career will really take off after this CD and I'm sure he is great in concert.
B000002U8G|5.0|A great work. New release is remastered well.  Climax in \\"Echoes\\" never fails to send chills  down the spine. Every cut is good.
B000P2A24W|5.0|This CD has a little bit of something for everyone, from classic \\"Bon Jovi\\" sounds to guest appearances by country stars like Big Kenny and Leann Rimes.  You can't go wrong.  It is a great CD for a long drive or getting ready to go out.<br /><br />From a country fan's perspective Bon Jovi has been able to present a hybrid album country fans will love without compromising Bon Jovi's unique sound and style.<br /><br />My favorite song on this CD is without a doubt, Summertime.  It has an upbeat melody and fun summer lyrics.
0062502182|5.0|I read this book at least once a year.  It is a translation so sometimes it reads like a 7th grader wrote it.  However, that is not fair.  The story is beautiful and it picks me up and reminds me that all is right with my world.
B000JJRIO8|4.0|2pac has been gone since 1997, but his music still lives on through numerous reworked and remixed pieces of his work.  Sure, after Makaveli 1-10 were released, you though it wasn't possible for any more to be done with his music.  Wrong!  Now, with Pac's Life, the rapper's work is paired with new production and top-level recording artists.  Swiss Beatz opens up the album with a remix of the song \\"Untouchable\\" with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.  Ashanti and T.I. appear on the title track while Snoop pops up for the remix version.  Hussein, Papoose and Carl Thomas join forces with 2pac for the ominous \\"Dumpin'.\\" Young Buck and Chamillionaire bring some Southern flare with \\"Sleep,\\" while \\"Don't Sleep\\" features Lil Scrappy, Nutso, Yaki Kadafi, and Stormy.  Yaki Kadafi pops up a couple more times for \\"Soon As I Get Home,\\" \\"Don't Stop\\" with Big Syke, Hussein, Young Noble, EDI, and Stormy, and 'original' version of \\"Untouchable\\" with Hussein and Gravy.  Keyshia Cole shines on the female version of \\"Playa Cardz Right\\" while Ludacris gives us the fellas version of the song.  Even though there are a lot of familiar faces, it still sounds like a lot of songs 2pac wouldn't have done in the first place.  But just hearing \\"new music\\" from 2pac does help keep his memory alive.  It's makes you wonder, how many more albums like Pac's Life will they concoct?
B00012FXB8|5.0|Poorly received upon release, and long despised for the deaths of beloved characters, Alien 3 was plagued by script troubles, personnel changes, and time constraints due to excessive meddling by Fox.      Into this mess stepped David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en), in his directorial debut on a feature film.  Harassed and bullied to no end by studio execs, Fincher ended up walking off after the end of principal photography and what was released in theaters was a butchered remnant of a brilliant film.  The release of the Alien Quadrilogy returns to the Alien fan an Assembly Cut (Fincher was still too bitter to work on a Director's Cut) of what was close to Fincher's original vision of the film.      Definitely skip straight to the Assembly Cut.  It will be well worth your time.  Whereas Cameron's Special Edition of Aliens ends up overlong and many additions unneeded or damaging to the pacing (I can hear the cries of \\"Blasphemy!\\" now), the thirty three minute increase in length is a profound improvement to Alien 3; almost a whole new movie.  This is what a \\"special edition\\" of a movie should be.  Characters are fleshed out, confusing parts of the plot explained as important scenes are restored or extended, and Fincher's directorial genius better felt.    A powerful story of redemption and sacrifice, Alien 3 is filled with all of the compelling imagery of Fincher's later work.  Alien 3, aside from the creature special effects, stands as the most darkly beautiful of the Alien films, and the most visually breathtaking.  Here, finally, the true strength of Sigourney Weaver's acting prowess can be felt in a story with real meat.  The depth of the character Ripley can be more fully appreciated, and her final scene now carries the meaning it was intended to have; a true choice between sacrifice and tainted salvation.  Elliott Goldenthal's score remains phenomenal.  What we are given in the Assembly Cut is a third sequel that easily stands as an equal to the first two films, ifnot as the best picture in the series and what should have been a most fitting end to a trilogy.      If you've not seen this movie in a long time, do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD, or the Quadrilogy boxed set (though nobody will fault you if you skip on Resurrection).  It will certainly change your entire perspective on the film, and perhaps the entire series.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|Eminem was originally going to put out a mixtape just to introduces Shady newcomers Bobby Creekwater, and Cashis.  But after some careful deliberations, he decided to go ahead and put out a posse-heavy mixtape instead and market it under his name.  The inclusion of everybody from 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks of the G-Unit, D-12, and the new guys, Eminem was able to come up with enough polished tracks for The Re-Up.  It also helps Eminem too since it seems like he's been in a little funk lately.  Last year he put out a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album titled Curtain Call despite the fact that he's only released 4 albums.  This is when the rumors of his supposed retirement escalated to an all-time high.  So with the help of , Eminem's existence is further extended.  Now even though The Re-Up is a well-marketed mixtape, it still has a few cuts worth listening to.  The Shady Records posse cut \\"We're Back\\" features Eminem along side Stat Quo, Obie Trice, and newcomers Bobby Creekwater and Cashis.  The first single \\"They Don't Know\\" featuring 50 Cent, Eminem, Cashis and Lloyd Banks is the most mainstream track of all the unreleased material on the album.  Stat Quo's solo cut \\"By My Side\\" is impressive, along with \\"Everything Is Shady\\" by Cashis and \\"We Ride For Shady\\" featuring the dynamic duo of Obie Trice and Cashis.  There are remixes of other songs that were previously released.  Obie Trice offers up two of his own, namely his reworking of D12's 2001 single \\"Pistol Pistol\\" from their Devil's Night disc and a remix of his own song \\"Cry Now\\" featuring D12's Kuniva, Bobby Creekwater, Stat Quo, and Cashis.  Stat Quo and Bobby Creekwater improve upon Eminem and Akon's \\"Smack That,\\" while Eminem and 50 Cent give us \\"The Ski Mask Way\\" remix to enjoy.  There are a few missteps like the mundane \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\" by Eminem and 50 Cent, the weird offering of \\"Whatever You Want\\" by Mr. Porter and Swifty McKay, and the horrible \\"Shake That\\" remix with Bobby Creekwater, Nate Dogg, Obie Trice, and Eminem.  Only serious fans of anything Shady should add The Re-Up to their collections, but everybody else should borrow the disc and see if it's worth the time.inem.

If the child is not capable of maintaining its head held upright it just soft of squirms and wobbles on the toy and cries for help. This toy should be rated 3 months and up not zero to 5. Other than that the price was great and my daughter really enjoys looking at the colors of the toy even if she cant play with it yet.[[ASIN:B000I2MRHE Lamaze  Spin & Explore Garden Gym]]
0618680004|4.0|Mr. Dawkins uses our own logic against our beliefs, and does so effectively.  The illogical belief structures that exist in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are laid bare.  Some chapters are superb.<br /><br />Others, however, are not.  Mr. Dawkins is overly smug, uses humor in a manner confusing to non-British readers, and fails to answer some questions adequately.  Mr. Dawkins flounders badly when trying to explain such issues as why religion is so prevalent if there is, in fact, no God.<br /><br />I know of no other book that addresses this range of topics in a logical manner.  Whether or not you are ultimately convinced, the exercise is well worth taking.

B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I rented this movie recently and found it deeply disturbing and offensive.  It starts out well but later, becomes a vehicle for the most unlikely, HIGHLY anti-american conspiracy nut garbage.  I'm tempted to smash the disc into a thousand pieces rather than return it.    Seriously.  It's highly offensive stuff and nothing in the reviews or advertising for this piece of filth even hints of what it's really about.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson is showing a considerable growth since the release of her last two discs. Thankful and Breakaway. My December is perhaps the most emotional, diverse, and original disc I have heard from any of today's current singers in some time. Tunes such as \\"Irvine\\", the chilling, pleading ballad of a lost soul, showcase Clarkson's ability to freeze one in their tracks. Other tunes such as \\"How I Feel\\", \\"One Minute\\", and \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" set off very melancholy and forlorn experiences to an almost retro 80's thump. \\"Yeah\\", a song that is very catchy and quite reminescent of Prince's heyday, is a tough chick song that says \\"I've got it, if you can handle it\\". The sole ballad. \\"Be Still\\" is a heartbreaking cry to slow everything down and try to go back to where one got lost, accompanied with a slow and melodic, almost hypnotic thrum. \\"Haunted\\", \\"Judas\\", and \\"Hole\\" are all very rock oriented and heavy in their sound, a new approach to her music that Clarkson pulls off without flaw. The second to last track, \\"Can I Have a Kiss\\", is very singer-songwriter but with an edge to it, pleading for love even though the person is not exactly worth it. \\"Maybe\\" is a slow building song that takes off like a locomotive and then settles down to a quiet roar towards the end, a song that says \\"Yes, I've got problems, but I'm still human.\\". But this is not all the tracks. Stay tuned after the final strands of \\"Irvine\\" and a song will start to play called \\"Chivas\\", an alcoholic beverage. The song is very sarcastic and cute and is a great, funny way to sum up the entire album with a zest.     Indeed, My December will take some getting used to and it may be hard to accept for fans of Clarkson's lighter sound, but in the end one cannot help but love this ecletic mix of music. I give the album an A++!!

B000NVIXFK|5.0|As with every Rush album, you need to listen quite a few times to \\"get it.\\" Every album is great in its own way, but admittedly some are greater than others. Most fans of Rush would probably agree that the last couple haven't been among their best and some may have wondered if Rush had passed their prime.    Enter Snakes and Arrows. I've listened again, and again - and I get it. Not only is it a better album, I consider it among their best. There have been comments that it gets back to their roots but I don't heard a lot of \\"classic Rush\\" in this album. I do hear a lot of \\"classic\\" however.     There is a lot of beautiful acoustic guitar and several breaks and transitions do have that 70's even late 60's feel. Some of the funkier, bluesy stuff is more honest and sincere than any past attempts. Alex always seems to push the artistic beauty of the guitar to new heights and this time around is no different as evidenced by \\"Hope\\", an acoustic beauty. Geddy's bass and Neil's skins, as always, are awesome.      Many of the songs are smoother and more melodic (like some of their later 70's works), even at their most hard and driving points. There are modest keyboards in this album - not too much, not to little. And though not as complex as some of the past greats, songs like \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" still leave you with that intense head-shaking, \\"wow\\" effect. (I love that effect!)     There's a pocket of Rush fans that can't get past Permanent Waves. If you want Rush to create another 2112, well, it isn't going to happen and this album is no different in that regard.     But if you've always been a Rush fan and see the beauty in every album, you're going to absolutely love this one. If you were a Rush fan and then lost it in the 90's, this album could bring you back in the fold. Either way, this album proves that Rush is definitely not yet past their prime!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a majority of the sounds of the show in Las Vegas.  While it is missing some of the spoken word items, it still is a great capture of the music of the show.

As a former zookeeper, I really appreciated the \\"family photos\\" on the wall of the zookeeper's house - all animals! Little touches like that make the book a real gem to be treasured. My daughter is now three and she still loves this book.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Personally, I'm not a fan of b&w films, but this one is by far one of my favorites. Though it is long, it's well worth the time spent watching it, in my humble opinion.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I liked the \\"Thankful\\" album, loved the \\"Breakaway\\" album but hated \\"My December\\". I'm a big fan of Kelly's. I've been to several of her concerts and I agree that she is one of the best female vocalists out there. BUT, this album took a sharp veer off of what I thought her style was. I loved the rock feel of Breakaway and was expecting more of the same on this album. But, it was dark and lacked cohesiveness. She was all over with the style of her tracks but they all had a sad or angry undertone. There was lots of shouting and repetitiveness on many of the cuts. The lyrics were rather interesting (and not so bad) but the music to go along with those lyrics was horrible. On some of the songs, in the first minute, I thought this isn't too bad, but, then the song would leer off into a different melody or direction and completely ruin it for me. The only song that I vaguely liked was \\"Sober\\" but that one got so repetitive at the end, that I just had to skip to the next song. I'm so sad that Kelly has gone this route to express herself. I'm all for creative outlet and really baring your soul, but not set to this kind of music. I wish that I didn't preorder this album. If I had listened to the tracks on itunes before I ordered, I never would have purchased the album.     EDIT:  After reading all of the 5 star reviews, I thought, maybe I just missed something.  I listened to it again 3 times in a row.  I so desperately wanted to love this album like her other 2.  3 of the songs eventually grew on me.  Although I still don't LOVE any of the songs, I actually  like 3 of them now.  Funny though, some of the ones I liked were actually ones that others didn't rate as highly.  Of the 3 I like, \\"Sober\\" is the standout for me.  It has a beautiful melody to it.  I can hear \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" on the radio.  It has a hook (unlike many of the other songs on the album).  The hidden track \\"Chivas\\" was a nice surprise.  I didn't care for Irvine as much, but I listened through the whole way to get to Chivas (and it was worth it).  So, with that said, I'm going to change my rating to a 2.5 stars out of 5.  I really hoped I could eventually get to at least a 4 star rating but after 6 listens, I just don't think it will happen.  sorry    To all of the Kelly fans that didn't care for this album, check out \\"I'm Not Dead\\" by Pink.  It's full of hooks, melody and great writing, just like Breakaway.  I think you'll LOVE this album.
072325804X|3.0|I loved the tale of Peter Rabbit so I decided to get the collection of Beatrix Potter's \\"tales\\" for my 4 year old son.  I've been trying to introduce books that are a bit longer and have different stories or chapters to encourage him to want to hear the next story (pre-reading skills).  He often used to ask me to read an entire children's book which could be as long as 45 pages, which wouldn't help him when he was learning to read and I wouldn't want him to become frustrated.  Many of the Beatrix Potter stories are a bit difficult to read aloud to a child since the language is more proper English rather than current day conversational English and consequently can be difficult to follow for a young child.

0061122416|2.0|I bought this book because of all the hype surrounding it. Sadly this is nothing more than a children's book. I agree with the other reviewers who put it in the same class as those disdainful self-help books. I think it's a good book for an adoloscent, but hardly something an adult would derive any value from. The book is full of meaningless generalizations and stereotypes. I suspect the only reason it became so popular was because it was written by an 'Exotic' Brazilian. Had the author been John Smith, nobody would care about it.

0099288524|4.0|Graham Greene (1904-1991), who was one of the more illustrious British writers of the 20th century, enjoyed a very long life, and a long, prolific writing career, during which he gave us  [[ASIN:B000NRWNSW The Power and the Glory]]; [[ASIN:0140286829 The Third Man]];[[ASIN:0099478447 The End of the Affair]]; and [[ASIN:B000K6GT6I Our Man in Havana]], among many other well-known masterworks, most of which were made into notable films. ( [[ASIN:B000IJ79U2 The Third Man]];[[ASIN:0767847415 The End of the Affair]]; [[ASIN:B001LMAK6A Our Man in Havana]].)<br /><br />The author, in fact, bookended the life, and writing career, of another very-well known British author of spy novels, Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond, 007. Furthermore, Greene was still at work -- he published up until almost his death-- when John LeCarre, another well-known British writer of spy stories, whom he heavily influenced, was hitting his late-middle writing years. However, the LeCarre-Greene relationship might best be considered a two-way street, as \\"The Human Factor,\\"the Graham Greene book at hand, has a plot that strongly resembles those by LeCarre; and characters that aren't so different from those of the younger man, either. Be that as it may, Greene's books were very well-written, highly literate, much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership.<br /><br />When Greene's rather late-career \\"The Human Factor\\" was published in 1978, it spent six months on \\"The New York Times\\"  Best Seller List.  This was remarkable only insofar as Greene apparently didn't much care for it, called it \\"a dead albatross round his neck,\\" and threatened \\"to leave it in his drawer,\\" as the writers' phrase for holding a book back from publication goes. Nevertheless, he sent a copy of the manuscript to notorious British counterspy/defector Kim Philby in Moscow: they'd been friends since Oxford days. Greene always denied that Maurice Castle, counterspy/protagonist of this novel, was based on Philby; their career arcs, however, echoed each other.  (By the way, the real-life mole Philby blew the covers of many British agents secreted in the Communist bloc.  John LeCarre, under his real name, David Cornwell,among them.)<br /><br />Greene himself had first-hand spy experience.  He'd been recruited to Britain's World War II Secret Service, MI5, upon Philby's recommendation, to serve in the African country of Sierra Leone.  And he has set this novel in the lonely, dangerous world of the spy.  \\"The Firm,\\" as Greene called the Secret Service, with \\"C\\" as its Control, employs near-retirement Castle, after an undistinguished career, in the small, unimportant African bureau.  Castle's brash younger colleague, Davis, is itching to get out from behind the desk, and hopes to go to Sierra Leone.  Agency administrators become convinced that there's a leak in the small bureau, and Davis pays for it.  But the agency fails to recognize the human factor.  Castle appears settled, middle-aged, suburban.  Still, he's married to a black South African woman he'd smuggled out of that country, stepfather to her black son, and has reasons to hate that juggernaut, particularly when the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States make it secret commitments.<br /><br />This book was evidently quite personal to Greene.  Aside from the Sierra Leone echo, he portrays Castle as living quite happily in suburban Berkhamsted, his own home town.  Greene was a graduate of Balliol College, Oxford, England's famous, ancient university.  He was one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his books deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption.  He wrote a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style, that boasted almost cinematic visuals.  His spycraft was accurate, his plots sufficed.  He created characters with internal lives; they faced struggles, and sometimes they despaired, or suffered world-weary cynicism, but often they prevailed.  He always treated them with insight and compassion.  Critics have pegged  \\"The Human Factor\\" as one of Greene's late, lesser works.  If he interests you, you might want to start with one of his earlier, better-known books, but this one isn't too shabby.Human Factor\\" as one of Greene's late, lesser works.

B000OVLBEO|1.0|I will never understand why stories that are inherently dark are dumbed-down during their transition to the big screen.  \\"Let's have the hero spout off some cheesy one-liners, and fill the film with laughable villains, and we'll have a movie the whole family can enjoy.\\" Because that's important, putting kids' butts in the seats at a movie about a guy who has sold his soul to the devil.  Perfect for a Happy Meal tie-in.    Nicholas Cage, as wonderful an actor that he is, is horribly miscast -- filling what should be a brooding portrayal with bizare Cage-like eccentricities.  Why have Johhny Blaze be a dark, tormented loner (because, again, when you sell your soul to the devil there might be a slight chance you'd be a bit moody)when he can be a motorcycle superstar who listens to the Carpenters and eats jelly beans out of martini glasses?    An amazing source material turned into a painful, unbelievably bad movie.

The Police's rhythmic interplay between just three guys is the standard to be measured by. Stewart Copeland's drumming is so rhythmic, it sound like he's got three rhythms going on at one time. He is truly one of the greatest drummers in rock history. Sting is also one of the all-time great singers.

B00005JPAO|5.0|It is easy to understand that The Queen received the award as Best Picture.  Not only was the production superb, but the casting of Helen Mirren and James Cromwell was inspired.  Not be overlooked should be Michael Sheen as Tony Blair - he captured the essence of the public servant who understood the grief of the masses and tried to communicate this to the royals.  Altogether a picture to remember.

Track 1 - \\"I'm Forrest . . . Forrest Gump\\" will immediately turn a day around for me, it is a strange song that calms the spirit and instills confidence at the same time; much like the rest of the score. Great for background music at work! The soundtrack is a great collection of classic hits but it doesn't take me where the score can. Just an incredible work of art!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Breakaway is among my favorite cd's which still surprises this Ozzy fan to no end. Here, on My December we find what you would expect from the radio-friendly genre (though not what you'd hope for); ie, rock-pop with little pop and not much rock.    Gone are the amazing hooks of Breakaway and in their wake is a lot of belly-aching about failed romances put to generic/mundane riffs. Kelly's voice is still strong and distinct but again... getting back to Breakaway, that had all this PLUS amazing hooks and genuinely great songs.    Maybe I expected too much; after all what do we have here? A TV show contest winner, a juggernaut press machine, and an endless supply of musicians that have no personality beyond what she gives them. Irvine is interesting; the single is passable; but really this isn't a follow-up to Breakaway as much as it is a detour from perfection. Still, this disc should have been held over until December when something a bit more potent could be mustered.     Don't worry Kelly, third albums are a tough gig even for the very best of them.

0739350323|2.0|The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel is a captivating story.  The characters interact well with each other and the story line, for the most part.  However, I found the use and mention of various new technology electronics was too abrupt.  They seemed to be thrown in like raisins in rice pudding, rather than used to enhance the story, say - like cream in coffee.    I did find myself eager to return to the story as soon as possible after each time I had to stop and continue my own life's duties.      I would have liked to see Mrs. Flamel more intouch and more influential throughout the story.    I liked the questions that came to mind about Dee as he interacted with the boy.    This book is definatley worth reading.  I guess I had too high expectations after reading HP(x6) by JKR.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This cd is amazing and you will not think that right away. Give it time to sink in. What really makes her shine is the acoustic or slow songs. They are an honesty we have not seen since the 60's and 70's. Think Janis Joplin or Mama Cass. My favorite songs are Never Again, One Minute, Sober, Don't Waste Your Time, Judas, Be Still, Maybe, Irvine and Chivas. I listened to my download of this and thought hard before I bought this. There is so much truth in this album. How her record label could not hear this, they gotta be blind. Kelly can do any genre of music with the voice she has. Nowadays, there are very few artists who can do this. Kelly, thank you for this album and for not compromising yourself. We all relate to the story you tell.

I'm really disappointed. All the songs sound the same, except for Sober and Irvine. Irvine almost sounds like it belongs in a cafe, which is a nice change but still not mind-blowing. In Breakaway, I loved every single song. On this, it's just... not so inspiring. Sorry, Kelly.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I just bought a Toshiba HD DVD and a Sharp Aquos 37 inch LCD HD TV. I wanted to test the system out with an HD DVD. I could not get HD DVDs at any store in town. I thought that Planet Earth would be a good one to try my new system out with. I was right in getting this DVD. The photography is AWESOME! I would recommend this DVD to anyone ! The KIDS might even learn something ! Just beautiful photography ! The soundtrack is not REAL good surround sound, but who cares? The photography out weights the sound anyway.
0757302661|2.0|While there are some interesting and useful ideas presented in this book, \\"some\\" is the operative word. I was disappointed to find out that this book is less of an informative work, and more of a marketing tool to get you to take the hypnobirthing classes. She will spend pages talking about a wonderful technique, only to glaze over any form of instruction by saying \\"...this technique, which you will learn in your class.\\" Frustrating, and a waste of time. I was hoping to get something out of the book, because I did not have the time nor the money for the lengthy and expensive classes.    Additionally, she makes some pretty hefty promises, including a \\"painless\\" birth. I know several people who have used this method and while it helped them, nobody has described their birth as painless. My OB warned me against trusting any program that made such a promise, and I think she's onto something.    Another aspect that bothers me is that she encourages an \\"us vs. them\\" mentality when it comes to healthcare providers. Of course, you need to be in a position of making informed decisions with your doctors and nurses, but she makes it seem like hospital staff is out to ruin your birth, which was so far from my experience, and this mentality that she (and many other pregnancy/birth authors) pushes is completely counter-productive in the real world.    Finally, there is some flat out inaccurate information, which makes me question the other \\"facts\\" presented in the book. For instance, she includes butter and fruits in her list of foods to help you meet your protein needs. An entire stuck of butter only has 1 gram of protein; fruit is a poor source as well. And rather than giving into your evil doctor's advice should induction become necessary, she tells you to eat spicy food -- a complete myth. Maybe some people go into labor after eating a taco...but some people go into labor after eating an apple, too.    If you don't intend on taking the classes, I don't think this book is worth while. But then again, if you do plan on taking the classes, you will most likely learn everything you need from them, making this book unnecessary.
B00006AUIG|1.0|ok it's about group of laboureres who get un-hinged by vibes and finding old case-notes in an abandoned looney-bin.The acting and dialogue is garbled i couldn't follow this movie at all.It just scrambled my brain for an hour or so.
0141439688|4.0|Readers of Jane Austin will immediately recognise the basic plot of Persuasion: single women/girls being courted by men of various levels of eligibility.  Two sisters (a third is already married) and their father, a minor noble, have fallen on hard times.  Sir Walter Elliot has been widowed, they have lived beyond their means, and now they must rent out the family estate and live in diminished circumstances in Bath.  The putative heir to the estate, cousin William Elliot, is vain and arrogant, refusing any interaction with the family.    The main character of Persuasion is Anne, the disregarded middle Elliot daughter.  She is kind, gentle, and tolerant, which puts her is rigid conflict with the rest of her family who are pompously jealous of rank and privelege.  In fact, the rest of the Elliot family supplies much of the satire for the novel: their scheming to arrange meetings with their betters and the scorn they show to their lessers.  This reviewer might even go so far as to say that the humour is not so much satirical as it is ascerbic - nowhere else does Austin seem to dislike her characters so much, and to make them the objects of such ridicule.  This is not a criticism, as this ascerbic wit sets up many funny moments and observations; more, I think, than any of her previous works.    Unfortunately, I found this to be the most confusing of Austin's works: I had trouble keeping track of all the characters.  Confusion is increased because all the men seem to be named Charles!  Luckily, a thorough knowledge of all the characters is not required to follow the main storylines (although the reader might miss a few subtle jokes).    I'm not an expert on Jane Austin, nor on English literature.  However, I have read most of Austin's works, and this layman's opinion is that Persuasion is enjoyable and the funniest of Austin's works.
B000A88EV4|5.0|I highly reccomend this version of Naked.  David Thewlis and Mike Leigh are on the extras and they both add a new dimension to the film.  My very old VHS version completely pales in comparison.    Buy it, you'll be glad you did!
1594489505|5.0|I read this book in one day.  I could not put it down. I am not going to give you details of what it is about, because you can read that when viewing the book. I just will say that I loved it.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|The one thing I like the most about Dave Mustaine and Megadeth is that they're very consistent.  No games played here.  No punches pulled.  They came to rock and that is that. This is metal you can believe in.  Dave is gonna tell you a story of what he believes and what he doesn't, what he likes and dislikes.  Oh yeah!  Metal riffs aplenty!  School is in session.<br /><br />Sleepwalker - Great opening song.  Much akin to Skin 'O Your Teeth or Reckoning Day.  Straight-ahead rocker.  No one is safe, when I close my eyes ... I come to take you alive!  Perfect!<br /><br />Washington Is Next! - Over the years Dave's political views have overshadowed the potency of some of the songs with his rhetoric and rantings, but not this time.  Washingtone Is Next!  is clear and concise and valid.  Plus, it rox!  Another killer tune. Great hooks.<br /><br />Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms - The opening riff sounds like something off of Peace Sells or Rust In Peace.  Rocking.  This is a cool tune.  Great chorus.  Grows on you.  I know your enemy once was me!<br /><br />United Abomination - It took four songs before Dave got to do his mock newscast.  Last album it was the very first song.  This little trick has become a Megadeth staple.  This time it still works.  United Abominations as a whole album is very politically tinted.  This song rocks all the way up to the final part where Dave goes into his THERE WAS NO U.N. speech.<br /><br />Gears Of War - Great intro.  Another song that's just a straight-forward rocker.  Electric, concise, driving.  Gears of War!!!!<br /><br />Blessed Be The Dead - The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  Great song.  This is typical Megadeth in fine form.  As a  whole you can tell that Dave's hired guns are starting to groove as a musical unit.  Where The System Has Failed was a choppy in places with a lot of thrown-together songs, this album is cohessive and flowing.<br /><br />Play For Blood - Another solid tune.  God, we missed Megadeth.  Dave brings such attitude to his lyrics.  Great!<br /><br />A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free) -  This is one of Dave's favorite songs.  He considers it to be his masterpiece.  Many will argue against this (including me).  But it is a killer tune.  Did he need to re-do it here? Probably not.  Could have been a stumbling block on an otherwise smoothly-flowing ablum, buts it's not.  In fact, it fits right in.  Sang as a duet with Lacuna Coil's  Christina Scabbia, this version is very cool.  Is it better than the original.  Maybe.  It grows on you.<br /><br />Amerikastan - The rant is here.  Oh yeah!  You knew it was coming.  Dave has to have one at least once an album.  Most of the time this really detracts from the song and here it does.  This song is so politically fueled that it's nearly comical in nature.  I'm not sure if that's was what Dave was going for.  Got some cool spots, but overall, it bites.  Jihad Joe, we're coming to get you!  Are you kidding?<br /><br />You're Dead - Great opening riff.  The Megadeth dudes are grooving together.  This song is pertty much filler but it's Megadeth filler and that makes it better than most.  One day I'll dance on your grave, even if you're buried at sea.... Hmmmmm.  Missing hooks.  Not going to be your favorite song.<br /><br />Burnt Ice - Actually a good album-closer.  This is coherent and concise.  Swirling riff that reminds me a little of The Scorpion.  Definitely a lot of metal here.  The drums sound good, the riffs are drilling, and Dave's lyrics are, for the most part, pretty intimidating.<br /><br />Overall, United Abominations is about war and death and political upheaval and doom and destruction.  It is also very metal and that's what you came for if you bought a Megadeth CD.  Well.....Mustaine delivers and Megadeth remain the North Star of metal, firmly planted in the heavens.  Everything is right with the universe because Dave is pissed and Megadeth are coming to rock you into the ground.<br /><br />Dig it!(Set Me Free) -  This is one of Dave's favorite songs.  He considers it to be his masterpiece.  Many will argue against this (including me).  But it is a killer tune.  Did he need to re-do it here? Probably not.  Could have been a stumbling block on an otherwise smoothly-flowing ablum, buts it's not.  In fact, it fits right in.  Sang as a duet with Lacuna Coil's  Christina Scabbia, this version is very cool.  Is it better than the original.  Maybe.  It grows on you.    Amerikastan - The rant is here.  Oh yeah!  You knew it was coming.  Dave has to have one at least once an album.

Not going to be your favorite song.    Burnt Ice - Actually a good album-closer.  This is coherent and concise.  Swirling riff that reminds me a little of The Scorpion.  Definitely a lot of metal here.  The drums sound good, the riffs are drilling, and Dave's lyrics are, for the most part, pretty intimidating.

B00003CXCW|5.0|One of the all-time great Tinseltown satires, Wilder's noirish tale of an opportunistic, down-and-out young writer and the nostalgic, delusional film luminary who ensnares him takes a harsh look at an industry that eats its own. Holden, whose character narrates from beyond the grave, is impeccable as the sardonic Gillis, but the show belongs to real-life silent star Swanson, an ideal choice to play the creepy, twisted Norma. Great support from Nancy Olson (playing Joe's appalled girlfriend) and Erich Von Stroheim (as Norma's protective chauffeur) round out this shocking, sordid gem.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|While this movie bears the name of Resident Evil it does not follow the game story line at all. In fact other than the evil corporation Umbrella, the zombies and the licker, this movie has nothing to do with the game. If this movie had been called anything other than Resident Evil it would have been an excellent movie. Milla Jovovich is a severely underrated actress she is great as Alice. All the cast is very good you feel for them when they get hurt or they die. In my opinion those who are hard-core fans of the game keep an open mind and try too watch the movie as what it is: a good Zombie flick.
0553296981|4.0|I'm extremely glad that the movie 'Freedom Writers' inspired me to buy this book from Amazon.com! This diary is one cheerful young girl's account of a semi-life in hiding from the Nazi's.  No wonder it is the second most popular book in the world, only second to the bible - it truly brings history to life.<br /><br />Even knowing the fate of Anne cannot smother the shock of reaching the conclusion of her diary. It's one thing to hear of the horrific things that transpired throughout the holocaust, but to read a 'private' diary and grow to know all the 'characters' mentioned in it, is to become even more uncomprehending of the horrors inflicted on these people based on their race.<br /><br />Anne was obviously very intelligent, a talented writer, and possessed an enduring spirit. A story that emphasises the beauty that can be lost due to the evil of men.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, Kurosawa's brutal, invigorating martial classic concerns the all-important code of honor among feudal Japan's warrior caste. Both Shimura and Kurosawa regular Mifune, playing a loudmouth rube posing as a member of the elite military class, give towering performances among a robust cast. As in John Ford's Westerns, Kurosawa carefully delineates each of his characters before unleashing the lurid battle sequences, the likes of which have yet to be equaled on-screen: the town raid, ferocious clashes on horseback, and barbaric hand-to-hand melees. Few films have even a fraction of the fluid visual power and visceral intensity of \\"Samurai,\\" truly an essential work of cinema history.
0141439610|5.0|I have read this book several times and just reread it after many years.  I don't understand those who think it hard to follow. If one pays attention the plot is easily understood.  Too many people are used to being spoonfed and have trouble with Dickens and Collins because they demand attention.    This book is frightening and not in any supernatural way but because I wondered what I would do if I had been Laura or Anne, shut away in an asylum against my will.  what would I do if I were trapped and unable to reach anyone to help me?  It's this helplessness that is so frightening and the inability for the law to do anything without proof.    I highly recommend this book.  And Marian Halcamb is a true heroine in a Victorian era, fighting back at injustice.  These are characters you won't soon forget although Laura is very much in the Dickens mode: pretty, complaisant, mostly, and depending on others.  A woman of her times.
0767834739|5.0|This movie is almost perfect in its execution. Sure its still not completely faithful to the game but hey you cant have it all. This movie is so entertaining you will not even notice the time passing. Nemesis is scary and tough. The story is actually very good and entertaining as well. Siena Guillroy is excellent as Jill Valentine and Oded Fehr is a very good Carlos Oliveira. All in all a very entertaining good movie.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I always find it interesting to read the reviews after Dream Theater releases an album. In short, you never get any type of consensus from the fans. If they release a heavier album, half the fans want it to be more orchestral and moody. If they release a melodic album, half the fans want something heavier. If they play too fast, some people want them to slow it down. Playing too slow, on the other hand, causes the speed demons to turn their heads. Too much keyboard - not enough keyboard. Too much Portnoy, too much Petrucci. Not enough Petrucci, not enough Rudess. Bring back Kevin - and on, and on, and on, and on. Honestly, it's tiring.    But, you know what - behind it all is an army of hard core fans (mostly, dare I guess, musicians themselves who, by all measurements are always the harshest critics) who, whether they know it or not, are giving this band the highest form of praise you can ever give: In a word, VIRTUOSITY. These guys can spread themselves across such a wide range of styles that they have, along the way, picked up fans of all shapes, sizes, and musical tastes. So the fact that Dream Theater can never please them all at once is a testament to their artistic range, their musical talent, and, yes, their virtuosity.    Should I tell you about Systematic Chaos? Well, if you haven't guessed it yet, I loved this album. I am a fan of their more melodic works like Scenes From A Memory and the second disc of Six Degrees and, yes, even of the oft slammed Space-Dye Vest. That's not to say that Train of Thought doesn't have a coveted place in my collection. But I just happen to like the \\"catchier\\" albums a little more. So where does this one fit? Well, quite honestly, right in the middle. Every song has it's own set of big brass ones. But mixed in between are the signature catchy hooks that made this band so famous. I've seen many comparisons to many of their different albums in the various reviews, but the closest I could come is somewhere between Six Degrees and Octavarium - probably closer to the former than the latter.    I do have a few specific comments regarding the songs:    1. In The Presence Of Enemies Part I is a great opener featuring fast, high-energy riffs and the beginnings of a structured epic. The problem is that it doesn't go anywhere (clearly because it was recorded as one song with the closer). In any case, it's a good enough tease for the album that follows.    2. Forsaken is the catchy single. It is, in my opinion, the most listenable song on the album from the standpoint of wanting to hear it over and over again.    3. Constant Motion is, by far, my least favorite song on the album - mostly because it is a total rip-off of Metallica. They do it well, but this is not at all an original song. Dream Theater falls into this trap every so often, but never so obviously as this, in my opinion.    4. The Dark Eternal Night is a solid song with ripping solos, speedy runs, and dark but decent subject matter (feels a little Iron Maiden in it's story). Not a lot to remember, but definitely a lot to appreciate. My only problem here is with Jordan's \\"signature\\" ragtimey piano interlude. Jordan - enough already! I feel like he's trying to make this his trademark and, unfortunately, it's already been taken by Rick Wakeman. I wish he would drop the \\"piano in the western saloon\\" bit and break away on his truly original continuum instead.    5. Repentance is good, although too heavily influenced by Pain Of Salvation's \\"Be\\" album. I like the narratives, but POS did it just a little better.    6. Prophets Of War is another heavy tune with a great message. Not one of the stand-outs, in my opinion, but a solid contributor.    7. Now we're getting somewhere with Ministry Of Lost Souls. Some nice guitar work in the slower beginning parts, with one of the best vocal melodies toward the end that I have ever heard them build to.    8. And, finally, the rest of the first song. Again, great vocal melodies with an epic feel and anintense conclusion. But the song definitely loses some of its drive by being separated from it's start. Still, the album feels strong and complete with this one finishing it off.    So that's my take, for whatever it's worth. I love the fact that the fans are, yet again, mixed on this one. I hope they never all agree, because it will mean that Dream Theater has fallen into complacency and predictability - and that can never happen. But here's the most important thing - and please listen closely. I have seen a lot of different people who were fans since Awake or even Images. Well, I was a fan since the Majesty days. Truthfully, I followed these guys before they were ever signed and have been a die-hard fan ever since. And one thing I can say for sure is that they have all individually grown as musicians and, more importantly, have done the same as a band over their 20+ year career. These guys work hard at what they do and they are always honing their craft. I don't think we'll ever see them just sit back and take it easy and stop learning their instruments. And that's why their albums always evolve - in some cases even past their fans. But that's a good thing for the music business and, if we can all learn to appreciate it, a good thing for us.    Here's to another 20 years! May the rest of their career be as long as this review...
B000AP04NI|5.0|Though the film is long and contains a fairly high corn factor, it's also visually stunning, and truly soars whenever the music and dancing starts, with peerless renditions of \\"People Will Say We're In Love,\\" \\"The Surrey With The Fringe On The Top,\\" and the immortal title tune. The dance numbers, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, are original and exuberant, while Steiger and Gloria Grahame turn in fine performances, respectively playing the dastardly Jud and the naively amorous Ado Annie, \\"the girl who can't say no.\\"
B000HBK3MM|4.0|This is a great CD with some great feel good music. Corinne is classic and soulful and sexy. If you are in the mood for smooth, sexy, you go girl music and if you like artists like Nora Jones, Amy Winehouse, Joss Stone or Teena Marie, you'll enjoy this CD.
B000KJU182|5.0|EVERYTHING  and  EVERYONE  connected with this film is simply EXCELLENT.<br />This is Terremce Stamp's first film...and he got an Academy Award nomination for his role....and the entire cast is equally wonderful..  It<br />is about GOOD vs. EVIL...and it frustrated me, too...GOOD does not win.<br />But...I saw it first in 1963...and it certainly prepared me for a lot<br />of what was to come.  Mind you...I always HOPE that GOOD will be<br />triumphant.  I still do!  I would say to you...it is good to know<br />what the alternatives are going to be.  This a an exceptional film in<br />every way.  You will not regret buying it and owning it.  Of course,<br />you will still not be able to change the perversity of life. Too bad.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|There are two kinds of albums.  On one, the artist is a degree removed from the heart of the song that someone else wrote, trying to be calculating and sly to please everyone.  And then there is My December.  How many times have we hoped for just a few songs on an album that reached down deep and touched that part of us that yearns for some recognition of what it means to cry out in pain at those we have lost?  Kelly Clarkson has written every song here from her journey of the past two years filled with passion-loss-hate-anger and finally acceptance.    In this world full of hypocrites striking a pose,  she simply delivers the truth in every song. Her own.  This album deserves to be recognized not only for Kelly's authentic talent but more importantly for its courage to tell what she has been through that she shares with anyone who might be looking for something to hold onto. Its refusal to compromise with lukewarm lyrics to appease the hand-wringing cowards makes me want to stand up and cheer..     Every song touches deep down in the emotional recognition of some past sorrow in all of our lives.  Every track thrills.  Incredible how her blunt lonely cries strike a chord.  It's goosebumps time.  It is truly a great album by one of the most courageous we will hear.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Zinnemann's \\"The Nun's Story,\\" showcasing the luminous Audrey Hepburn in her prime, contemplates hardship, devotion, and a very special kind of self-realization. A literate, nuanced drama with size, scope and color, the film boasts superb location photography and uniformly fine performances, both from the young leads and two English Dames in support: namely, Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft, playing senior nuns who guide Sister Luke along her often thorny path. Based on Kathryn Hulme's autobiographical novel, \\"Story\\" is an affecting, heartfelt epic of inner struggle.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites!  The storyline is timeless, no matter how   long ago it was created.  I find myself looking at the fashions and thought, \\" Wow The Women are a glamorous bunch.
0805047905|5.0|This is an excellent book. All children, including my 3 year-old, seem to absolutely love it! It is catchy and the children learn colours and animals in a fun way. Educational and fun - what more could you want??
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I loved V, I would classify it as a thriller and a \\"what if\\".  The stage is set in London, England but this tale could really be set in any society that once had a democratic government.  It shows the horror of what could happen if a society freely gives up freedoms for protection.  I also really enjoyed the message of freedom and the power of ideas that were throughout this tale.  A must own!
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|A box-office smash in 1952, John Huston's engrossing biopic about the discordant life and loves of famed 19th-century painter Toulouse-Lautrec is drenched in colors taken from the artist's own palette. Shot mostly from the waist up, but acting on his knees, Jos&eacute; Ferrer does a remarkable job of conveying the gloomy Toulouse-Lautrec, whose infirmity crippled his self-esteem but instigated his flagrant art. Zsa Zsa Gabor, as entertainer Jane Avril, is captivating, while composer Georges Auric's now-classic score gives \\"Rouge\\" a melancholy cast. The flamboyant opening sequence is one of Huston's finest set pieces.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This  is a very educational video.  I recommend it to everyone.  Not just Americans.
0321344758|4.0|All in all, while there doesn't seem to be a ton of NEW information for web designers that have been in the field for a few years or more, Steve does a fantastic job of taking all of the bits of knowledge and tying them together in a cohesive, easily understandable structure, shedding new light and insight along the way.  That's not to say there is NO new information.  Everyone will find something in here that they didn't know before.  More importantly, however, are Steve's perspectives into really making what you already know work for you.<br /><br />The book does a great job of breaking down the web design process in an easy to digest step-by-step process, calling out challenges, obstacles, and no-brainers along the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed having lots of what I'd picked up over the years brought into focus and examined through new filters.<br /><br />The one thing that I wish this book had is a detachable checklist.  Or one that you can download and print from his website, [...]  Now that the entire process is broken down and defined, it would have been nice to have a quick-reference checklist for practical use a day-to-day operations.
1594489505|5.0|I read this book in just a few short days and I absolutely loved it. It is by far the best book I have read so far and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed The Kite Runner to read this.  The treatment of women and the impact of the troubled times in Afghanistan is heart-wrenching. It's compelling and captivating at the same yet extremely sad (it will make yu cry). Great way to learn about the history and heritage of Afghanistan, especially because most of us in the U.S. are so oblivious to what really goes on out there since all the media ever airs is Iraq or Paris Hilton.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|An evergreen animated fantasy based on J.M. Barrie's beloved children's book, Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" features dazzling hand-drawn visuals, excellent voice acting, and a winning score epitomized by the song \\"You Can Fly!\\" Rendered by Driscoll, Peter is refreshingly cocky, and even Tinkerbell has a bit of an impetuous streak; Hook, of course, is as dastardly as ever. Made by the same team that later created \\"The Lady and the Tramp,\\" this thrilling, imaginative tale bests the 1923 live-action original, and leaves most other versions in the (fairy) dust as well.
0812550706|5.0|I read this book once back in 1987 and I still remember it vividly. How many books can you say that about?    I read constantly. As soon as I finish one book, I pick up another and get started. I've read more books than I can count. I liked some of them, loved some of them and hated the rest.    Ender's Game is a fantastic epic story that has stayed with me all these years.    Give it a read. You won't be disappointed.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Brad has done a wonderful job on this CD. I love every single song! I have laughed out loud and cried real tears listing to it for the first time! Thanks Brad!
B000OMD4BG|5.0|It totally astounded me. I had no expectations, but would not have been surprised if these tracks were left off Elliott's records because they were somehow sub-standard. They are not. Either/Or could have been a perfect double CD with the inclusion of these tracks. If you are an Elliott fan, you will be exstatic about these archival gems.
B000O599XK|5.0|Hawks's colorful, exciting western boasts an archetypal, larger-than-life turn from the Duke, and perhaps Martin's finest acting job ever as Dude. Film neatly blends pathos, suspense, comedy, even songs to create top-notch entertainment. Look also for Ricky Nelson as Colorado (he and Dino get to croon together), and the leggy, alluring Angie Dickinson as Feathers, a young woman with her eye on Chance. Bravo indeed.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS CD DAILY FOR 2 WEEKS NOW.  I have to agree with the writer of \\"Too Soon;\\" people are jumping to their keyboards too quickly to review this disc.  It's very different from their last 2 albums.  At first, I wasn't very fond of this recording for several reasons, which I'll explain.  Now, I can't stop listening to it.  In fact, 2 weeks after receiving it, I find myself putting it on over and over again without stopping...a rarity for me, as I have a very large, eclectic collection of music (over 10,000 songs ranging from jazz to classic rock to punk to speed metal) and I really like to bounce around.  Also, I got to catch a live performance of the new QOTSA line-up on the Henry Rollins show...they did \\"Misfit Love\\" and it was freakin awesome!    First off, this CD is almost TOO accessible, a la \\"Rated R,\\" in that the tunes are SO catchy and so playful, it throws the avid QOTSA listener off at first.  I wasn't too fond of \\"Sick, Sick , Sick\\" when I first heard it on iTunes, but once I got the entire CD, I found that the rest of the record totally jams from start to finish.  For me, I had a problem with 2 major things: (1) the \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" sound (my favorite QOTSA CD) is now totally gone, and (2) the entire \\"Era Vulgaris\\" record sounds hauntingly like another Desert Sessions expirement...not just because it added \\"Make it Witchu.\\"    After careful listening, I finally noticed something--this album rocks on so many levels.  It's raw, it gives the feel of a REAL jam session, and the musicians are tight, innovative, and not afraid to go off into an ad-lib solo at any time.  Not to mention, Joey Santiago's drums are, once again, stellar.  He is IMO the best rock drummer today.  The music mixes that difficult to follow, \\"math rock\\" element (a la Shellac, Jesus Lizard and Slint) the playful, raw, fun elements we are used to with the \\"Desert Sessions\\" recordings, but we have vintage Josh Homme music writing.  Most of these tunes are unbelievably catchy.  MOST IMPORTANT--a band finally found a way to put the line, \\"It puts the lotion in the basket\\" into the lyrics of a song.  Brilliant.    Rather than go into each song, I'll just say this: just pick the CD up.  If you're a fan of QOTSA, I'm sure you'll agree that this is their best effort since \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" and is also every bit as good (and nearly as LOUD) as their self-titled debut.  Highlight tracks, IMO are:  Misfit Love, 3's and 7's, Turning the Screw, I'm Designer, Battery Acid, Into the Hollow and Run, Pig, Run.  There's not a weak track on the album.  And anyone who knows this band realizes that every album is different; as listeners, we have to expect the unexpected with JH and his merry band of music freaks.
B00006690G|5.0|Em's flow remains strong here.  His writing is maybe a bit less creative in this one, with him paying more attention to the tunes, but still good.  The raps definitely hold interest, which is why I gave this one 5 stars.  Good raps:    White America - Em muses on his success any mabye it having a lot to do with him being a white rapper and so accessbile to more fans.    Business - very bouncy and catchy rhythm.  Dr. Dre is featured.  A fun tune to hop along with.    Cleanin Out my Closet - a big blast at his mom    Soldier - different sound to it, fast and nervous, edgy like something's about to go down and the rapper is jonesing    Drips - slow, kinda languid rap about STD    Sing for the Moment - mixes Em's raps with the Aerosmith tune.  Works well.  Em says you gotta reach out and grab your chance    When the Music Stops - excellent fast and chaotic tune featuring a lot of guest rappers.  Looks at how a lot of rappers have let the craziness of their music seep over into their lives and the line is blurred, with tragic consequences in the real world.      My Dad's Gone Crazy - excellent tune about Em and his experiences growing up/coming up and how important his music is.  He states in this tune that he'll never stifle himself for the critics.  Lots of anger in this one, well directed into energy.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|Fiest off I consider myself a Kelly Clarkson fan. But.... I also know what I like and what I don't like and this cd is more like therepy for Kelly than anything musically coherent. No real rhyme or melody. And after listening to her yell out so many of the songs I want to rip my ears out. I'm sorry, just my opinion. I know other fans would love her if she stood there and whistled.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|One of Disney's most endearing family classics, \\"Tramp\\" is a marvel of lively animation, bright voice acting, and sensational songwriting, courtesy of the inimitable Peggy Lee (who also voices the sinister twin kitties, Si and Am.) Watching a pampered female pooch fall for a declass&eacute; but charismatic male doggie is not only fun but enlightening about the magic of mutual attraction. And the famous spaghetti-slurping scene leading to a surprise first kiss is charming no matter how many times you view it. Highlights include the vamp-y \\"He's a Tramp\\" and \\"Siamese Cat Song.\\"
B000A7S4B0|3.0|Simple -- Great album, more to the blues than to the J & the Mary Chain.  The security sucks --- I played it on my computer once and now it will not let me play it there anymore --- and the computer is where I spend more than half my waking day.
B00004TB5B|5.0|Worthy follow up to the Slim Shady LP.  In this disc, Em goes back to his roots in some tracks, but also talks about life now that he's made it.  All the writing strength is still there, and the guy still flows great.  Good raps:    Stan - excellent, almost chilling, rap about the pyschology of an obsessed fan who progressively comes unglued when Em doesn't answer his fan mail right away.  The chorus from Dido's tune is excellently woven into the rap.  Very grim ending.  Em's critics couldn't write anything this insightful    Who Knew - good, sarcastic examination of critics who blame music for some wacko's actions.    The WAy I Am - Em gets off his chest frustrations of being famous and never getting a second's privacy from fans who never think maybe he likes to be let alone once in a while.    The REal Slim Shady - very bouncy, catchy rhythm and lyrics.  Got lots of radio and video play    Remember Me?  - hardcore rapl  Em gets to yelling in it.  Features other rappers.  Very heavy    I'm BAck - Em is back, again knocks/mocks people who blame him for others' actions.  Kinda slow and slurry at times, like a record being dragged    Amityville - very heavy, Em yelling in this one too    The Kids - funny rap w/South Park references.  Would be lighthearted, except people wind up meeting bad ends.      Criminal - another rap aimed at people who blame Em for violence
B0000AKY7R|5.0|I bought this LP in 1973 when I was 12 years old.  None of my friends understood it, and quite honestly I didn't either, except that it took me to a different place musically and spiritually.  I had no idea at the time that this piece of music was a tribute to John Coltrane.  All I know is that the guitar work, the organ, and percussion were and still are overwhelmingly powerful.  By the way -- I was listening to The Carpenters just prior to purchasing the LP so many years ago.  If you are Santana or McLaughlin fan, and want to appreciate a soaring and scorching musical triumph, then you must include this masterwork. This album along with Jeff Beck's \\"Blow By Blow\\" prepared my ears and soul for a lifetime of jazz appreciation.  Make some tea, put on some earphones, crank the volume, and make sure that you are not operating heavy or dangerous machinery.
B00003CXC7|5.0|One of the most celebrated films in history, this classic takes its time, but once the tension starts building, it doesn't stop until the heart-pounding conclusion is upon you. A new peak for Hitchcock in blending the story of a crime that may have happened with the dark side of human obsession--in this case, voyeurism. The movie marks a high point for James Stewart, who would be remembered as Hitchcock's most human and vulnerable hero. And who can resist the bewitching Grace Kelly?
B000MX7V5M|4.0|I am probably being unfair on \\"To Catch a Thief\\" giving it only 4 stars when the original was released more than 50 years ago. There is no denying that Hitchcock captures Grant's and Kelly's performances and the south of France so eloquently. Furthermore it was enjoyable hearing the French speak French. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Another ICONIC program brought to us by the prestigious BBC.  Just breathtaking and truly amazing images that totally describe our beautiful and amazing Planet Earth.  A must see and have in your DVD collection.
B000GFLEJA|5.0|...older, meaning more than 4-5 years old (or earlier generation dvd's).  I read the great reviews of the transfer and have seen my share of disappointing high-def discs already.  So I was skeptical when I bought it. This is one of the best (funniest) movies ever.    <br />    Well, I first watched the opening scene and some parts of my Criterion version (which had been a better standard transfer) on my 56 HD-RPTV.  It used to look great on my 32\\" tube TV.  It looked terrible on the bigger screen of course, making me scared of another cruddy HD transfer like my Sleepy Hollow or the Game (worst ever so far).  <br />  <br />After the first few seconds of the opening scene, let alone the rest of the movie, I loved this transfer (HD-DVD).  Now this is how \\"somewhat older\\" films should look like on HD-DVD!  Absolutely amazing colors, contrast and sharpness.  The vegas lights look fantastic as do the rest of the colors in this \\"trip\\".  No annoying digital noise, a few specs of dust on the film which I never mind, and the dust/smoke is rendered beautifully.  The DD+ soundtrack is great and it has a DD True soundtrack even though most of us at this point can't take full advantage of it.  What a fantastic job this is- I'm loving it.
B000PY52EU|4.0|First of all, it's obvious this isn't the type of movie that would be everybody's cup of tea. Let me tell you why it was mine though. Being someone who really loves old time blues music it was like a video track to all great blues tunes! It reaches to the heart of the music and tells a great story at the same time.... The title itself was taken from a song by 1920's bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson.  Take a nymphomaniac who has paired off with a weak-willed man and then through fate introduce her to a world wise ex bluesman with an obsessive religious streak and every character's issues are out on the table. The acting performances in this movie are compellingly believable and well done. From the first fifteen minutes of this movie forward you are drawn into the lives of these people and you can't help wondering how things will turn out for them.   Most profound of all though this movie is a powerful and gripping story about love & redemption. While liking blues music may give you more of an appreciation for it, this is hardly a requirement to enjoy this film. It's the type of movie that when it's over you walk away feeling like the world is more hopeful and bright. The best advice I can give about this movie if you're thinking of buying or renting it is DON'T JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER!
1594489505|5.0|Like the Kite Runner, this is a fantastic novel - full of drama, reality and heart.  Dr. Hosseini has a talent for involving the reader and capturing our interest with the unexpected; there isn't a false note.  I hate to finish because I fear it may be a long wait 'til his next book!
B00005JP1A|1.0|This put the B in Bad Movies! Don't waste your hard earn money. If you can catch it on cable in a few years, do so but if you miss it.... trust me you didn't miss much!
B000O174CM|1.0|Dreamgirls is one of the worst films I saw in 2006. First of all, I can see why this picture wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the best picture category. And who said Jennifer Hudson could act, she would have never gotten the role of Elfie if it wasn't for American Idol. Hudson's acting so self-righteous and wooden, please tell how she won the Academy Award. Eddie Murphy can't sing and Beyonce looks like she doesn't know what's going on half the time, this film is pretty bad. I was expecting some great Broadway tunes but they are completely awful. The song, Cadillac is embarrassing and ridiculous. Stay away from Dreamgirls, such a pointless and idiotic musical. If you want to see a great musical then check-out  Grease, A Chorus Line, and Chicago.
B000P2A256|5.0|My first thought when I listened to this was \\"Well, it's good, but it's no \\"Songs About Jane.\\" Well - I've changed my mind. I think it may even be better. This is a great CD, Maroon 5 did it again!
0375728333|5.0|Book arrived in timely fashion, excellent condition, well packaged to protect it during shipment.  I'd read it in the library and thought it excellent.  I'm a logical person but not a physicist or a mathematician yet the material was understandable, well presented and the illustrations very helpful.  The absence of long proofs/equations not only shortened the book but made the descriptions and illustrations easier to follow and not so intimidating.  The large print version was especially helpful even though my eye sight is good.  I'll read it a number of times and I'm sure my understanding will increase with each reading.
B000H305U0|1.0|I am shocked that the author of this explicit album hosted the Nickelodeon Kids Awards. This is inexcusable, and a huge failing for the network. Kids listen to TV more than they ever did their parents, and what is this teaching them? I am 22 years old and I know that when I watched Nickelodeon ten years ago they never would have allowed such a person to host the awards.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I first bought this record in 1978. Great recording, stellar performances by the best line up, in my opinion, that Ian Anderson had ever put together. This CD has the best mix of acoustic and electric arrangements, clearly demonstrating the excellent musicianship of the band members. This CD has been digitally remastered, and it sounds great! I highly recommend this CD for all Tull fans, young and old. Its hard to believe this was recorded about 30 years ago!!! Enjoy a glimps into the dim and distant past...Jethro Tull ROCKS!!!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This has to be the best educational video of all time, and BBC and National Geographic have produced some excellent material in the past. The closeups are amazing, the detail is amazing, the colors are amazing, the naration is very entertaining and easy to understand. Everything about this is amazing! In addition, it is in HD DVD format, and it still so full of detail on my 123\\" screen!
B00008YJH5|5.0|Sure, some songs may sound a bit bizarre on 'Surfer Rosa' filled with pidgin Spanish jitterish, and yelling and screaming all over the place!<br />Even still the stream of consciousness flows on through filled with soaring guitar and at times the guitar play may sound a bit zany, especially on \\"Vamos\\" where Joey Santiago (lead guitar) just lets it loose! He really was (and is)a under-rated guitarist.<br />The band is in full form here complete with David Lovering's precise and cranked up drumming. And of course you got the band's leading lady, Kim Deal.<br />Yes, she is in stellar form on 'Rosa' providing one of her best known songs with the album's first hit - \\"Gigantic\\"-<br />Kim Deal is a wonderful vocalist (also check out the Breeder's Pod)and after their next album - 1989's 'Doolittle'- she hardly sang at all, eventually costing the Pixies to break up in the early 90s.<br />I do think Kim Deal is the Heart that makes the Pixies tick, w/o her they sound a bit tired like with their last studio release 'Trompe le Monde'- Just 'Forget the World' and leave Kim Deal out of it, yeah that's smart!<br />Anyways, my Top two favorite tracks may be a bit different then the average die-hard fan's normal choices. My Top Pixies song is \\"RIVER EUPHRATES\\" !! Absolutely amazing to my ears. I was in instant jaw drop mode when I first heard it. I know that may sound silly to many, oh well. It features Black Francis Screaming \\"Ride the tire down River Euphrates...\\" as Kim Deal chimes in with background vocals, a bit off and messy, but to me it blends oh so perfectly.<br />My second favorite song is \\"Break My Body\\" after the explosive opener \\"Bone Machine\\"-<br />It seems like to me that most fan favorites are \\"Gigantic\\"- and their most known and popular song \\"Where Is My Mind\\" which doesn't at all hurt the fact that it was on the end credits to the movie \\"Fight Club\\"<br /><br />- New to the Pixies ? Pick up 'Surfer Rosa' and if you like it (even if you don't) check out 'Doolittle' next and listen to the band that influenced Nirvana's soft to loud dynamics. It is possible without the Pixies, there wouldn't have been a \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as Kurt cited that he ripped off the Pixies while creating that song.<br />Hard to believe where Alternative Rock would be today without it's main influences. Oh well with 'Surfer Rosa'(& Sonic Youth) and subsequently Nirvana, there is no need to wonder.<br />- 'Surfer Rosa' for me, really is close to pure unadulterated perfection in all it's raw and glorious maniacal madness.

B000MXPE7Y|1.0|I read all the reviews and was extremely disappointed with my purchase. Don't waste your money on this one!
B000P7V45S|4.0|well as big of a fan of the gabriel era that i am i still enjoy this effort. not as heavy as the previous effort...what can be? besides the remastering the bonus dvd that comes with it is a must have.

B00007KWHP|5.0|I do believe this would make a good first buy for anyone that is new to the classic prog-rock band, YES.<br />As it is one of my favorites by the band, I do hear a lot of criticism on Fragile's opening track - \\"Roundabout\\". To me, this song will never get old. I heard it many years ago on classic rock radio and this would have to be one of the best opening songs out of all of the YES albums that I own, in it's full unedited 8 1/2 minutes. Very energetic and a fantastic epic to say the least.<br />\\"We Have Heaven\\" may seem like a simple filler to some fans, but I do think it highlights Jon Anderson's incredible vocals and the closing of the song steps into a gusty wind and now onto the second full group effort on 'Fragile' with \\"South Side of the Sky\\" possibly my favorite song on this album, containing some blistering guitar and a piano solo by newly added bandmember Rick Wakeman.<br />\\"Five Percent of Nothing\\" is a short track and exactly what the title says. It's Bill Buford's piece and a nice little collage of noise with time signatures. I just wish it was a little bit longer(only 35 seconds).<br />\\"Mood for a Day\\" is a beautiful solo guitar piece by Steve Howe. It's a good introduction to one of YES' finest efforts - the closer on the original 'Fragile' that was released in 1972 : \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\"-<br />a brilliant epic (the last of four on Fragile) about being lost in the city. It features driving guitars on this prog-rockin' masterpiece and haunting keyboards. \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" is one of the most popular songs by YES and to me it doesn't even feel like a 10 + minute song. Time flies, I guess when you listen to such an amazing song.<br />Taking you back to Earth, the sounds on 'Fragile' goes beyond the normal classic rock sound and the whole album takes it's listener on a Musical journey from start to finish.<br /><br />- If you enjoy Rock at it's most complex, I do believe nobody does sound better then YES, and I do think you will enjoy 'Fragile'- and if you do, check out other phenomenal YES classics : \\"The Yes Album\\" - \\"Close to the Edge\\" - \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" and \\"Relayer\\"phenomenal YES classics : \\"The Yes Album\\" - \\"Close to the Edge\\" - \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" and \\"Relayer\\"
159562015X|4.0|We used this book as a team building activity at our annual offsite planning session.  It was valuable and reasonably accurate and helped to guide people on the team to a better understanding of the personalities within the group.  It would be better if it ranked all 34 themes in the report so that you also knew where you were not strong.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|I first saw this film as a young eighteen year-old Western aficionado on its first theatrical release to the English provinces in 1956. I came to it with great expectations fresh from reading Alan Le May's book of the same name. I came away knowing I'd seen a great film but I was disappointed on two counts first the search lasts for ten years in the book and second, Wayne's character Ethan is killed off in the penultimate battle with the Indians. In the subsequent years I've seen this film dozens of times and it never fails to amaze me that on each fresh viewing I never fail to notice something new!    John Ford and John Wayne collaborated on several films most of them westerns. Although this was their first Western for six years since they completed the last of the Cavalry Trilogy RIO GRANDE (1950). As with the trilogy, Ford once again choose to shoot the most of the film in Monument Valley Utah, when using this his favourite location Ford became an acclaimed visual poet of the West. With Ford's \\"Western Director\\" to Wayne's \\"Western Star\\" they were unequalled in the making of Westerns producing an outstanding body of work between 1939 and 1962! Although THE SEARCHERS remained totally unrecognised by The Academy Awards for 1956. Fifty-odd years later it still stands at the top of the many peoples list as the greatest Western of all time. Also appearing in most if not all of The Greatest 100 Movies Of All Time Lists.     Three years after the Civil War Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) a dark brooding mysterious character returns home to his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) homestead.  Ethan takes his brother place on a posse led by Texas Ranger Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton (Ward Bond) on the trail of a raiding party, coming across some slaughtered cattle they realise they've been lured away whilst the main Indian party attacked either the Edwards or Jorgensen Homesteads.     The main body of the posse head back towards Jorgensen's place whilst Ethan along with Mose Harper(Hank Worden) rest their horses before heading back to the Edwards homestead, meanwhile Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) who had raised by the Edwards as their own raced on ahead against Ethan's advice. Arriving back at the smoking Edwards homestead their worse fears are founded, the two girls Lucy (Pippa Scott) and young Debbie (Lana Wood) have been taken captive and the rest killed. After the burial of his family a demented Ethan sets out after the Indians with a posse led by Captain Clayton. Following a skirmish with the Indians at the river, Clayton elects to take the wounded back home.     Ethan reckons on going on alone but Martin and Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey Jr.) insist on going too, not least because they fear what Ethan might do the girls.  So the three (later two) searchers set out on the trail of the Indians for five long years a couple of trips back to the Jorgensen homestead when the trail was lost and twice pointed in the right direction by Shakespearian Fool Mose Harper, that leads to a band of Comanche led by a chief called Scar (Henry Brandon). At the camp they discover the older Debbie (Natalie Wood) dressed as an Indian girl of marriageable age. Will Ethan carry out his threat to kill her or will Martin be able to stop him?    John Ford was the master of conveying terrible events to his audience through suggested violence, like the returning posse coming across the burnt out homestead with Martha's dress laying on the ground outside indicating the horrors that lay inside. Again when Ethan returns to Martin and Brad from finding Lucy's remains we just see the haunted look on his face as he plunges his knife in the earth to remove the Indian blood from the blade, all powerful stuff but left to our own imagination!    And not only suggested violence but also suggested love too, hardly a word pass between Ethan and Martha but the viewer is left with little doubt of a passed tender relationship between the two. The long narrative is held together bya couple of visits back to the Jorgensen Homestead and a letter from Martin to Laurie, read out to one and all! Ford's ending of the film has turned out in the end to be one of the most iconic endings in movie history. How could I have been so presumptuous as to think anything else?           This Two-Disc Special Edition includes new digital transfer from restored Vista Vision Picture with an introduction by Co-Star Patrick Wayne. Plus: The Searchers: An Appreciation and other extras. Don't miss John Ford's Masterpiece all at a bargain price from Amazon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000G1ALRK|5.0|He's a rising star. I love his music. Creative and just plain wonderful to listen to.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I saw this randomly on A&E or BBC or something a few years ago, and when I was bored searching on Amazon i was so excited to see it.  It really is one of my favorite purchases ever, the best movie to snuggle into at night or on a lazy day.

0553801481|4.0|\\"The Tawny Man:  Fool's Errand\\" begins \\"The Tawny Man Trilogy\\" with former assassin to the Six Duchies FitzChivalry Farseer narrating about his new responsibilities to the crown following a 15 year retirement.  Where the earlier series involving Fitz, \\"The Farseer Trilogy\\", had two differing magics of the Skill and Wit, a new magic emerges performed by one known as a Hedge-Witch and strangely is better received than the animalistic Wit.  However, the author continues to skillfully create character and environmental descriptions without any court politics supporting the storyline.<br /><br />There are connections between the Farseer chronicles and \\"The Liveship Traders Trilogy\\", mingling geography and legends along with one huge shocker concerning the Fool.  The majority of the novel focuses on Fitz and Nighteyes (granted it is an autobiography) with the rare individuals Fitz remained in contact with over the years and a couple new characters.  Prince Dutiful and Jinna with their respective magical abilities appear to have great potential but Fitz's daughter Nettle might be the hidden treasure toward the end of the saga.<br /><br />During his reflections, he addresses much needed history and teaching behind the Wit.  Readers hoping Fitz resume his duties or replace Chade as the kingdom's assassin will be disappointed.  A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
6305161992|5.0|Im not one for 80s or early 90s action movies but i did really enjoy this one.  Most action movies that have a woman being rescued etc. in it seem pretty cheesy cause the woman usually acts really fake.  I admire Tia Carrere and I think she was pretty strong in this film.  Who can forget her and dolph getting it on to? Not to be perverted or anything but that somewhat draws a woman into a action movie. I would defintely watch this movie again...and dont worry guys its not a sappy movie or anything but i would defintely watch it on a 2nd date...might get lucky!
032147404X|5.0|Many other reviews have described the layout of the book so I won't repeat that here. Let me just say that it's a great book for beginners. In addition to all the useful picture taking tips, there are also great tips on gear. Just beware, if you take all his advice on gear, it'll set you back a few grand. One caveat: this probably shouldn't be your only digital photography book. You should also probably get a more traditional one as a supplement, one that discusses principles of compositon, f-stops, aperture, light, exposure, etc. But sometimes (often) you just want someone to tell you what to do instead of having to apply what you learned from a book. This is where this book comes in. He just tells you the answers. He'll say \\"don't do X\\", or \\"use these settings\\", \\"the best focal length and aperture for portraits is...\\" and other no-nonsense practical tips. It's a fantastic supplement for anyone getting started in digital photography. Highly recommended.
0446364495|4.0|In 2003 while traveling across country, on a solo camping trip for 3 months, I drove to Madison County and found my way to Roseman Bridge. I had not read the book or the movie but knew from the title the \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" were something to see. It was a dusty hot day with no one around and I made a few pictures. A car drove up with three women who were on a literary tour. They had traveled from Japan, California and Texas to see Roseman Bridge. They asked if I could take their picture in front on the bridge and seemed genuinely moved by the experience - we did not exchange many words and I went on my way feeling a bit out of the loop. I decided one day I would either read the book or watch the movie - now I understand.    This is moving and wonderful work of art. The juxtaposition of the freedom loving man who chases his dreams, and the woman who sacrifices her dreams for the security of the routine, speaks volumes of the human experience on many levels. They both desired what the other had, but knew that in attainment would come its destruction. If only we could all be so wise - careful what you wish for.
B000IAZPKM|4.0|I like most of the Kamelot I have heard so far, have 2 CDs, but was hesitant to get this DVD with everything else that's available today. But the more I listened to \\"Ghost Opera\\", the more curious about their older material I became. So I changed my mind and broke down and purchased it recently, thought that would be a good start and have video too.<br /><br />Glad I did!! I've listened to the entire thing twice and have watched \\"The Black Halo\\", \\"When the lights are down\\" and \\"March of Mephisto\\" about 5 times each so far. Great sound and video, I don't know about some of the complaints concerning Khan's voice, it's clear and pretty powerful on my system.<br /><br />But my center channel speaker is turned up pretty high, which might explain some of it. And he sounds especially good when harmonizing with the background singers because just a little bit of them can be heard on the rear channels as well, making the overall sound \\"fuller\\".<br /><br />Bottom line...a good choice for anyone who likes good, creative, heavy music. Wish I could give it 4 & 1/2, it's better than a 4 but I feel 5 stars should be reserved for the true masterpieces.<br /><br />And here's hoping they release a DVD of the Ghost Opera tour, I'd like to see performances of most of those songs and it doesn't look like they're coming to the south (yet)!!
B000PFUAO6|2.0|If you wanted to hear this album, take their last album (Octavarium), remove the elements that made it a unique and very good album (excellent symphonic ballad at the end, the unbridled 5 minute speed and precision of Panic Attack, the thoughtful and overdone Sacrificed Sons), and water down the lowlights of the album (DT's trademark excessive noodling fantasticness), and, voila!  You have something you swear you heard before, and convince yourself the you haven't because you keep waiting for your favorite part, but it never actually comes.  DT does absolutely nothing new in this album.  Many of the songs are unintentionally rearranged versions of Octavarium songs, with nothing added.  The highlights of the album are few and fleeting.  The continuation of the Dying Soul from previous album Train of Thought is an interesting variation on a theme, and some of the meanderings on the opening track are new and, of course, brilliantly executed.  But I find myself constantly fighting the urge to skip to the next song, even after a few listens  I give this album two stars because the technical mastery is breathtaking as usual, and because it is still unique among music released by other artists, which is very difficult to say about any other group.  But if you have ever listened to even one DT album before, this will be terribly disappointing.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I was only six but I still remember when my mother took us kids to the movies to see 'The Sound of Music'. A memory permantly ingrained as is this film. From the most amazing opening shot ever filmed this classic film never lets go of yor senses. It's fun, thrilling and holds up extremely well. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are exquisite. Sure some of the lyrics are corny and simple but it all works and I'm not even a fan of musicals.

B000002UAU|5.0|this album created the legacy of the 'concept' album. No longer was an album all about selling singles it was about the collective soul of the songs. Very few albums have more soul then Sgt Pepper's even after 40 years. The story goes that the Beatles were blown away by 'Pet Sounds' by the Beach Boys which in their minds far surpassed anything that popular music had come up with. Their answer to 'Pet Sounds' was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. With the creative genuis of producer George Martin the Beatles put together an album that belongs in any aspiring Beatles fan collection. The White Album, Revolver and The Anthology are all great but this I think stands as the pinnacle of the Beatles music.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|what is indisputable is that our climate is undergoing changes the like of we have never seen before. This is one man's attempt to save our planet before we reach the tipping point. The tipping point being a point in time when no attempt by man can make any difference, sort of like a large rock rolling down a hill, once that rock gets to rolling it becomes nearly impossible to stop it. So don't shoot the messenger, listen to the messsage. This is not about blue or red states this is about the most pressing moral question of our time and what are we going to do about it if we can do anything. When I saw this in the movie theatre, I could hear the audience at times gasp and at the end applaud. People were clearly moved. Al Gore is not saying anything that hasn't been already voiced by scientists all over the world he's just saying it in a way that really reaches people. Please watch this and educate yourself more and hope the tipping point has not already been reached as some believe. James Lovelock believes it is already too late. Tim Flannery believes we can still make a difference and offers exellent ideas on how.
B000067FP8|5.0|I have a 3 & 6yr olds and they really like this movie. They request it over and over. They already have Gremlins 1 and this one is even funnier. It's not scary at all. The kids jump every now and then at the excitement of seeing the little monsters pop out but they know that they are not real and only make believe. You don't need to have seen Gremlins 1 to understand Gremlins 2. They are two different stories. This is a very old movie so there is not a lot of suspense and thrill. Just a nice little monster movie.

0316018953|4.0|Bosch is the best. Mr. Connolly is the best thing going when it comes to the crime genre. Harry Bosch is one of the great serial characters in fiction. However, there is more than a little bit of Jack Bauer in this latest Bosch adventure.  Harry is caught up in a terrorist plot that is threatening our nation's security. The story plays out in \\"24\\"-like timeline, with Harry stepping on toes and challenging authority. The reason for 4 stars, rather than the usual 5 for Mr. Connelly's work, is that this story lacked the nuances of Harry's character that makes his work transcend the genre. This was a good, quick read but not among Mr. Connelly's best efforts.

Season 2 of supernatural was just as excellent, if not better than season 1! There are several real gems here- particularly loved: \\"In my time of dying,\\" \\"Tall Tales,\\" \\"Simon Says,\\" and \\"Folsom Prison Blues.\\" I was on the edge of my seat as the actors struggled to fight various supernatural menaces as they searched for the big bad guy: \\"the yellow-eyed demon.\\"<br /><br />The only duds this season I thought were: \\"No Exit\\" and \\"Hollywood Babylon.\\"Both of these episodes I wasn't too crazy about.

One glaring possible exception, Timothy Dalton was too good looking to play Mr. Rochester, but I forgive him.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|While different from Breakaway, My December is the best CD of Clarkson's career, without a doubt.    Never Again - 3/5.  Obviously the weakest track on the album, not bad.. but not one to listen to repeatedly  One Minute - 4/5.  Very upbeat and poppy, not the strongest, but a good song to kick off with.  The chorus is particularly memorable \\"one minute you laugh//i get the feeling that nothing lately ever really lasts// and you love and you hate and you wait//cuz one minute goes fast\\"  Hole - 4/5.  A very heavy and depressed almost metalish song.  Sober - 5/5.  Possibly one of the strongest and most poignant melodramatic songs I've heard.  It's beautifully chilling and a favorite track among fans.  \\"three months and i'm still sober//picked all my weeds but kept the flower\\"  Don't Waste Your Time - 5/5.  This song is a very catchy and instrumentally excellent.  Judas - 4/5.  Judas is a personal favorite of mine.  The beat of the song catches your ear on first listen.  Haunted - 5/5.  Another chiller here.  Clarkson sings of somebody who committed suicide and she is still haunted by them.  \\"shadows linger only to my eye\\"  Be Still - 5/5.  Hear the signature beauty in her voice in this slow, hypnotic ballad.  Maybe - 5/5.  One of the most interesting uses of repetition I've ever heard.  Although she says \\"Maybe\\" countless times in this song, it has a subtle emphasis that makes it a standout track.  How I Feel - 5/5.  A sarcastic and witty song that you can't get out of your head.    Yeah - 4/5.  This one's a grower, at first I didn't like it much at all.  After a few listens, I grew to love it, so don't give up on it at first listen  Can I Have A Kiss - 5/5.  A strong balladesque song about sexual desire.  \\"if i can't hold you can I give you a kiss\\"  It's another grower but it's extremely good lyrically.  Irvine - 5/5.  Another showcase of Clarkson's flawless vocal.  I don't think its arguable that she has the best female voice out of any American Idol contestant thusfar.  It's magnificant and up there with the all time greats.     Although there's been a few bumps in the road, Clarkson managed to pull off this risky release.  She passes with flying colors.  A+
B00005JMJG|5.0|Very rarely does a film come around that is so utterly flawless I have absolutely nothing negative to say in its behalf.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is that movie.  From start to finish, from its script to its cast to its brilliant direction, `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is fantastic, engaging, entertaining and most of all genuinely refreshing, unique and completely original and that is a facet of film that is very rarely attached to a motion picture.  All to often the same concept is revisited time and time again with different actors but the same story is being told, and while the underlining moral behind this film, of the haste in action and the reversal of consequence, I can't say has never been broached I can honestly say it's never been exploited with such sheer brilliance and most likely never will again.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Joel, played by Jim Carrey in his finest performance to date, a man who falls in love with a woman any man would be lucky to find.  Clementine is funny, spunky and sincere, nothing like anyone Joel or maybe even the movie going public has ever met and immediately he is absorbed and content in her light.  Everything is going perfect, going as expected.  They love, they fight, they live and they repeat.  They have a normal, healthy relationship until one day when Clementine doesn't remember Joel.  Joel soon finds that Clementine had a procedure done to erase him from her memory and so in haste he decides to do the same only to realize partway through the process that his best memories are of her.  He struggles to save her, hide her away in the corners of his mind and his fight is so remarkable and heartbreaking to watch.<br /><br />Director Michel Gondry is a masterclass of a director, and here he is so remarkably in tune with his characters and their surroundings that every scene jumps from the screen and into our skin.  Every scene, every prop is a perfect compliment to the actors and dialog and chemistry that just illuminates and oozes forth with utter satisfaction.  The cast is also at the top of their game.  As I mentioned Carrey himself gives us the best performance of his career breathing so much maturity coupled with adult naivety into Joel that he becomes the man we know or perhaps even are.  Winslet though is a revelation as Clementine giving one of if not the best individual performance of the past decade.  Her character is not an easy character to create let alone master yet she effortlessly becomes Clementine and thus we become enthralled in every scene she accompanies.  The mere fact that Kate Winslet is nothing more than `Oscar Nominated' infuriates me to no end, but that is for another discussion.<br /><br />The supporting cast of talented actors is flawless.  Kirsten Dunst is charming and fun and Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as always.  Even Elijah Wood, an actor I've never really felt owned it, surprised me and put in a great performance despite its lack of length.  Plus, any movie with the great Tom Wilkinson is worth its weight in gold, and the subplot involving his infidelitious doctor is a great asset to the film.<br /><br />`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' dissects the most common of problems, human relationships, and does so with such grace and candor that the audience is involved and invested in every second of running time.  It beautifully captures the very real feelings of pain, abandonment and despair and the very childish ways that we as adults so often deal with those feelings and then of course the negative affect they have and our humane struggle to correct the problem before we're forced to live with it.  Charlie Kaufman's script is perfect, not a flaw in sight, and the casting of Winslet and Carrey in the leads was genius.  Neither of these actors, despite their rich resume, has ever accomplished what they have with this film as far as depth and richness of character.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' may have beensnubbed the Oscar for Best Picture, heck, it wasn't even nominated, but it proved to me to be the best picture of that said year and maybe even of many years that precede and proceed.snubbed the Oscar for Best Picture, heck, it wasn't even nominated, but it proved to me to be the best picture of that said year and maybe even of many years that precede and proceed.

B000957O82|5.0|While `Hitch' may not be the most original romantic comedy to hit the big screen it's one of the most enjoyable.  Will Smith is always entertaining and effortlessly captivating, but this time, with the pairing of the breathtaking beauty known as Eva Mendes and the hilarious Kevin James, Smith is brought to the top of his game.  The script is sweet and refreshing, the dialog is smart and funny and the acting is top notch.  Eva Mendes is not only beautiful but charming and funny.  She keeps proving with each role no matter how thankless that she is more than a pretty face.  This role is not thankless, thankfully, but just the same she's a star.  The real standout though is Kevin James who outdoes himself.  I've always loved James' standup and his show `The King of Queens' but here he really blows me away with his natural charm and humor.<br /><br />Smith plays Alex `Hitch' Hitchens, a date doctor as it were, who helps coach men into successful relationships.  His latest project is Albert, an overweight accountant who has fallen for the rich and beautiful Allegra Cole, a woman many may consider out of his league.  With Hitch's help Albert begins to woo Allegra and a mutual attraction between the two is formed.  In the meantime Hitch himself finds he's been struck by cupids arrow, falling for columnist Sara Meles, and soon we discover that Hitch is about as helpless as the men he coaches.  Between the two couples hilarity ensues and the audience is never left bored or wanting.<br /><br />As may well be expected events line themselves up to expose Hitch and his clientele and threaten to end both sets of blossoming relationships.  All is good though and the ride is a fun and entertaining one.  The chemistry between the entire cast is fantastic.  James feeds Albert enough charm and tenderheartedness that the audience falls in love with him alongside Allegra and Mendes plays Sara with enough sass and smarts that we can easily understand why Hitch is so absorbed in her.  Smith may be the star but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co-stars.  It's fun and breezy entertainment suitable for the entire family and will go down as one of my favorite romantic comedies of late.ar but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co-stars.

B000EMSUQA|5.0|This Swedish electropp dup is still pretty low-profile, though the Knife seem to be following in the footsteps of Broadcast -- eerie, atmospheric, pretty pop music. Third album \\"Silent Shout\\" returns to the band's root sounds, after the harder techno of their last album, and it's a breath of electronic fresh air.<br /><br />It opens with the blippy, spacey beats of the title track, which shimmers all over the place over some heavy grounding beats. A chorus of voices murmur, like a choir of robots. It's a great intro, and it's a big contrast to the song that comes after it -- the ominous, stomping techno of \\"Neverland.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the album is an attempt to reconcile the two previous sounds the band has had -- hard techno, and airy electropop. After \\"Neverland,\\" there are a couple straightforward techno songs that sound like a spacier Autechre, including the robotic \\"Like A Pen\\" and the schizophrenic space bleeps of \\"We Share Our Mothers' Health.\\"<br /><br />But the majority of these songs are softer and stranger. The Knife dips into spacey experimental music, tropical ambience with eerie yowls, shimmery electropop, ominous lullabies, and one song that sounds like a distress call from a spaceship, set to a soft electronic beat. It winds up with the undulating, whispery \\"Still Light,\\" which is perhaps the creepiest song of all.<br /><br />In \\"Silent Shout,\\" the Knife strike a good balance between techno and experimental soundscapes, which was missing from their previous two albums -- both were good, but they had entirely different music. They've learned moderation, using the harder beats in a softer melody, and also creating dreamy soundscapes that may not get people dancing, but might transport them to another planet.<br /><br />The harder beats don't even sound catchy -- they sound more like a sonic attack. Other synth gets twisted into kettle drums, pretty shimmers, and eerie sonic walls. Karin's voice is heavily filtered by computers, but this isn't done because it's a bad voice. Rather, it makes the pretty, fragile vocals fit in with the otherworldly music, as she lets out a series of Bjorkian yowls and murmurs.<br /><br />The Knife would do a great job with the soundtrack to a sci-fi movie, since they already have the right sound -- chilly, eerie and beautiful., it makes the pretty, fragile vocals fit in with the otherworldly music, as she lets out a series of Bjorkian yowls and murmurs.

0061240486|5.0|Fairy tales tend to lose their sparkle when they're made into books for adults.<br /><br />But Neil Gaiman creates his own sparkling fairy tale in \\"Stardust,\\" an entrancing fantasy tale that never loses its magic. With beautiful prose, likable characters, and a mesh of the grotesque and the ethereal, this is Gaiman's reworking of fairy tales -- with a slight wink to the readers.<br /><br />Years ago, Dunstan Thorn fell in love with a beautiful slave from across the Wall. Nine months later, he got a baby boy on his doorstep. His son Tristan grows up unaware of his heritage, and longs for the beautiful, frosty Victoria Forester. When she rejects him, he makes a rash promise -- he'll pursue a fallen star over the Wall and bring it back to her, if she gives him her hand.<br /><br />But when he finds the star, he learns that it is a beautiful young girl, a daughter of the moon named Yvaine. The dying Lord of Stormheld threw a gem to the distance and accidently knocked her from the sky. Now his sons are trying to get the gem back, since the one who gets the gem will be the next Lord, and an ancient witch is pursuing the star, determined to cut out her heart. To protect the lovely star, Tristan is called on to be a hero, and to learn who he really is...<br /><br />Few fantasy stories are as well-done as \\"Stardust.\\" Gaiman mixes humor, romance, grisly realism and airy-fairiness in a tight little plot. It only really picks up two-thirds of the way into the book, but what a trip it is. It slides rather than explodes to a conclusion, where everything slips into place and all the loose ends are neatly tied together, in a way that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />His writing is a mix of beautiful details and fast-moving plot. Gaiman frequently pauses to describe the creepy Stormhelm, where murdered ghosts watch their brothers compete, to the beautiful forests of Faerie where little sprites mock people. Some scenes -- like a unicorn's skewering a witch -- are breathtakingly vivid.<br /><br />Everybody loves an everyman hero, and despite his mystery background, Tristan definitely qualifies. He's a little goofy and a lot clueless, but his earnestness makes him likable. Yvaine is a bit off-kilter in a good way, sharp-tongued and a little naive, but a good match for Tristan. And supporting characters like the evil Septimus and youth-hungry witch are solidly written; even Victoria is shown in a new light.<br /><br />The beautiful adult fairy-tale \\"Stardust\\" is an entrancing read, wonderfully written and full of intriguing characters.

B00005JPFC|5.0|Anytime Pixar releases a new film, the question is: Have they done it again? They have raised the bar so high with their string of inventive, imaginative, beautifully animated films they are now in competition with themselves. So when \\"Cars\\" came out, it was a fun film, but it was no \\"Toy Story\\". When I told a co-worker that I had seen the sneak preview of Pixar's newest \\"Ratatouile\\", they immediately said, \\"Don't tell me they did it again?\\"<br /><br />Yes, they have done it again. \\"Ratatouile\\" is a great animated film. It isn't their funniest film, but it is one of their best. It seems like director Brad Bird is trying to create a more film like animated feature. His film just happens to be animated and have talking rats.<br /><br />\\"Ratatouile\\" is fantastic. And for many reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost is director Brad Bird. Bird worked for a while on \\"The Simpsons\\" and then went on to direct an animated film called \\"The Iron Giant\\". \\"Giant\\" tells the story of a young boy who finds a robot who looks like he was transported from a 50s Sci-Fi film. Because of this, the film has a decidedly retro look and appears very traditionally animated. As a result, Warner Bros. buried the film and it never achieved the audience it deserved. Then Bird moved on to Pixar and directed \\"The Incredibles\\". In one word: Incredible. This was the animated version of a James Bond film and a super hero film all rolled into one. Great characters. Great animation. Great story. \\"The Incredibles\\" is one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />Now Bird returns with this very different film that shares one similarity. In both cases, Bird seems to be making films that just happen to be animated. He crafts the story and the characters with such remarkable ability, making them appear as though they are human actors. And I think this will help his films transcend and become classics remembered by future generations.<br /><br />The beauty of \\"Ratatouile\\" is that it takes our misconceptions, our prejudices and some of the reality of life in Paris, and a gourmet restaurant, and combines them into a very amusing mix. It continues the Pixar tradition of building real worlds, real environments for these characters, making the films a little more genuine in the long run. As with all Pixar films, the animation is stunning, but in \\"Ratatouile\\", they have gone even one step further. The backgrounds, the textures, the appliances, Remy's fur, are almost photo realistic. Even the facial expressions and mannerisms of the characters seem real and if they didn't look like cartoon characters, you might think they were human.<br /><br />Remy (comedian Patton Oswalt, who has a lot of television work to his credit) is a rat who lives with his father and the rest of their large clan, in the French countryside. While his father, his brother, Emile (Peter Sohn) and the rest of the clan are happy to eat garbage, Remy aspires to something greater. He sneaks into the cottage of an old woman and learns of a famous chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett, TV's \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\"). The chef is on the old woman's television set and his bestselling cookbook, \\"Everyone Can Cook\\" is on her shelf. Remy steals the cookbook and one thing leads to another and he ends up in Paris. When he arrives at Gusteau's, the famous chef has passed away from heartbreak; one of his famed five stars was recently taken away by the evil food critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). But the famous chef appears as Remy's alter ego when the rat gets trapped in the kitchen. Linguini (Lou Romano) is hired to be the new garbage boy despite the misgivings of the new head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who regards the boy suspiciously. After Linguini ruins a pot of soup, Remy can't resist sneaking up to the pot and creating a masterpiece. But Linguini is given credit for the soup and the garbage boy soon realizes the rat made the soup and they work out a deal. But Skinner becomes suspicious and is convinced there is a rat. Linguini meets the one female chef in the kitchen, Collette (Janeane Garofolo) and she resents that she has to teach the new boy about the kitchen. When word of the new soup meets Ego's ears, he decides to review the restaurant again, causing everyone to panic.<br /><br />Incredibly, there is a lot more to the story that I haven't even touched.<br /><br />I wouldn't recognize Patton Oswalt if he was standing directly in front of me, but he does a great job providing the voice for Remy. He has a lot of television work to his credit and has been around a while. Oswalt brings a quiet angst to the role; Remy wants to be so much more than he is and all of the people around him aren't willing to support this, so he becomes frustrated. He knows there is more to the world and it is inconceivable that his family isn't interested in finding out more.<br /><br />Throughout the film, he talks to Gusteau, who becomes his alter ego. Their conversations are funny and help to create one of the most unusual animated duos to appear on screen in some time. Gusteau actually wants to help Remy become a chef and this rings very true. For a famous chef, who wrote a cookbook called \\"Anyone Can Cook\\", it would be natural for him to want to help anyone or anything that even expressed a desire.<br /><br />Brad Garrett is great as Gusteau. It takes a lot of work to even identify the voice as Garrett, and really the tell is the deep timbre of Gusteau's voice. Garrett doesn't play the role like a French Caricature, which helps to balance the film a little. He is merely very enthusiastic and the enthusiasm shows throughout.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance of \\"Ratatouille\\" is how the film plays with both the stereotypes and misconceptions of the French and some of the more realistic aspects of life in Paris. The film begins with a prologue setting up the status of Gusteau. A news story talks about his life, his bestselling cookbook and his famed restaurant. It also introduces the food critic, Anton Ego, when the story reveals how Gusteau's restaurant received five stars, then had one taken away. I have seen many articles about famous French chefs who have become suicidal when one of their Michelin stars was taken away. This is the type of detail the little kids in the audience would never get, but some of the adults might, and it helps to make the experience more interesting for them.<br /><br />Because Gusteau is so natural and seems so realistic, this provides a nice counterpoint to Skinner, the sous chef who takes over when Gusteau dies. Skinner, played by Ian Holm, is the complete opposite of Gusteau. Nervous his new empire might be taken away, scheming to make more money, and going a little crazy because he believes Linguini has a rat in his toque, Holm plays the character very broad but it works very well. He has the energy level and instincts of Wile E. Coyote. It is a fun performance and the character is great.<br /><br />Janeane Garofolo plays Collette, the one female chef in the kitchen. Because of this, she is very tough and protective of her position. So, naturally, she resents having to baby-sit the new chef. But she also becomes Linguini's friend and ally, until she feels she has been betrayed. It is a nice performance, one that could easily be found in a non-animated film. Because it is fairly realistic, it helps \\"Ratatouile\\" seem more believable, more natural.<br /><br />The big surprise for me was Peter O'Toole. I didn't realize the actor was even involved and it took me a while to place him as the food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole brings every nuance of his voice to the evil, stern character. Tall, with a hawk like nose, Ego walks into a room and expects to be noticed, but he doesn't acknowledge anyone who does notice him, which makes him all the more menacing. O'Toole does a great job of giving the character a lot of depth and menace. There is a brilliant scene late in the film which helps to make the character all the more believable.<br /><br />There are so many levels at work in \\"Ratatouile\\" I have only managed to scratch the surface. Brian Dennehy plays one of the characters and John Ratzenberger also provides a voice. It wouldn't be a Pixar film without him, would it?<br /><br />\\"Ratatouile\\" is a great animated film.<br /><br />As is the tradition with Pixar films, they are showing an animated short before the main feature. \\"Lifted\\", directed by Gary Rydstrom (an Oscar Winning sound engineer many times over for many feature films) tells the story of an alien cadet who is trying to pass one of his tests. The test? To extract a sleeping farmer from his bed in his farmhouse and bring him up to the spaceship. His instructor looks on with great displeasure. This is a hilarious delight and a great way to set the mood for the rest of the film.taken away.

Nervous his new empire might be taken away, scheming to make more money, and going a little crazy because he believes Linguini has a rat in his toque, Holm plays the character very broad but it works very well. He has the energy level and instincts of Wile E. Coyote. It is a fun performance and the character is great.    Janeane Garofolo plays Collette, the one female chef in the kitchen. Because of this, she is very tough and protective of her position. So, naturally, she resents having to baby-sit the new chef. But she also becomes Linguini's friend and ally, until she feels she has been betrayed. It is a nice performance, one that could easily be found in a non-animated film. Because it is fairly realistic, it helps \\"Ratatouile\\" seem more believable, more natural.    The big surprise for me was Peter O'Toole. I didn't realize the actor was even involved and it took me a while to place him as the food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole brings every nuance of his voice to the evil, stern character. Tall, with a hawk like nose, Ego walks into a room and expects to be noticed, but he doesn't acknowledge anyone who does notice him, which makes him all the more menacing. O'Toole does a great job of giving the character a lot of depth and menace. There is a brilliant scene late in the film which helps to make the character all the more believable.    There are so many levels at work in \\"Ratatouile\\" I have only managed to scratch the surface. Brian Dennehy plays oneof the characters and John Ratzenberger also provides a voice. It wouldn't be a Pixar film without him, would it?    \\"Ratatouile\\" is a great animated film.    As is the tradition with Pixar films, they are showing an animated short before the main feature. \\"Lifted\\", directed by Gary Rydstrom (an Oscar Winning sound engineer many times over for many feature films) tells the story of an alien cadet who is trying to pass one of his tests. The test? To extract a sleeping farmer from his bed in his farmhouse and bring him up to the spaceship. His instructor looks on with great displeasure. This is a hilarious delight and a great way to set the mood for the rest of the film.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|The negative hype surrounding this album had me cautious of buying it; I'm not the biggest Kelly fan and only recently got into her music. I have to say I'm glad I did. I cannot praise her enough for sticking to her guns and writing, singing and producing the album she wanted to. After the first play, I admit I was under whelmed, it seemed almost too dark and depressing. Even a little bit bitter, you can tell she took the break up very hard.   However, with every subsequent play it grew on me. Her songwriting, while not perfect comes straight from the heart. Her voice, without question, is flawless. Her first single Never Again is great, and like most songs gets better with each listen. Her second single Sober is perhaps the best of them all, with Maybe coming a close second.  Kelly has stated she didn't want to make the same album twice (as her label was pressuring her to) and I, for one, am extremely pleased she didn't. It is fantastic.
1400063515|3.0|Taleb has an important but rather simple message to deliver. It can be summed up in three words: Rare events happen. That was the point of Fooled by Randomness (which is a better book), and it is the point here.<br /><br />Once this main point is made (and it is irrefutable), there are any number of embellishments, examples, and explanations that can help the reader round out his or her understanding of the concept. This would be a 5-star book if the author had written it to help the reader understand the basic concept and its implications.<br /><br />Instead, the book reads like an ego trip. His delivery is maddening. He seems to be filled with anger. The book viciously attacks many well-meaning, competent people in academia, finance, science, and other fields for no apparent reason, other than that they don't see (or agree with) his point.<br /><br />For that reason, I found the book hard to read. Some reviewers have called it funny; I found no humor in it. Instead, what I found is an author who clearly thinks he is smarter than everyone else and allows that to get in the way of clarity. He seems to take joy in belittling those who \\"outrage\\" him by their stupidity. (Really, what kind of person gets \\"filled with rage\\" over others being unable to see an academic point?)<br /><br />Another quality that makes this book hard to read is the deliberately opaque way that Taleb chooses to make many of his points. If there is a straightforward way or an obscure way to make a point, he consistently selects the obscure way...using unfamiliar references, saying \\"secundo\\" instead of \\"second,\\" inventing a non-existent author to make a point about book sales rather than choosing a real-life example, and so on. Taleb seems to think such writing is \\"erudition\\" (a quality he clearly admires). I believe that it puts an unfortunate academic-style veil over the book.<br /><br />I've learned from both of Taleb's books--Fooled by Randomness and this one. I've learned not only the main point--that rare events happen, and they happen more often than we usually expect--but I've also learned something about how not to write. Writing I most admire is deliberately written to be understood, not to get in the way of understanding.happen more often than we usually expect--but I've also learned something about how not to write.

B000001ES4|4.0|As a fan of \\"Secret Garden\\" I have enjoyed this CD for weeks now.  I fall asleep to it almost every night.  It is not my very favorite, prefering the turn of the century one, but I do alternate listening to both.  I am looking forward to a new album, as the recently purchsed one has mostly repeats on it.  Talented musicians, composers and singers make this CD incredibly enjoyable and I do say I love it.
B000L212HC|5.0|As others have said if you like Christopher Nolan's other films you should enjoy this one. I really liked David Bowie's potrayal of Nikolai Tesla.<br /> Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine are all great in this story of passion,jealousy and deception. Christopher Nolan is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.<br /><br />As far as the \\"forced ads\\" goes you can't jump to the menu but you can track forward through everything but the FBI warning, its annoying but not as unbearable as the other reveiwer made it out to be. I too wish they would stop this nonsense. I'm all for the previews on the disc just give me the choice of watching them.

B000F3AAUW|3.0|gday  im an australian who enjoys purchasing their music via the internet either via ebay, amazon, etc. It is usually cheaper to purchase music material over the internet but i understand that given that this requires time for postage i am usually patient. this is the second time i have purchased an music album from the US but the last time i ordered the item from ebay and i recieved the item within 10 days.  Im not sure what efforts can be made but to wait 20 days for a CD from the US seems excessive when other items are able to be sent in a quicker span of time between payment/purchase in the US and receipt in Australia.  This is my only complaint. I appreciate the range of products but surely postage could be arranged so it arrives within a quicker time-frame than 20 days.  Thank you
1594489505|4.0|Hard to top the Kite Runner and this book does not, however it was a very good second book.  Right after finishing the Kite Runner, I started waiting for this book, perhaps building my hopes up a little too high.  The author switched from a story about men (Kite Runner)to a story about women (Splendid Suns).  His vivid descriptions are such that you feel like your a fly on the wall observing these women's lives, much of which is full of sadness and degradation.  Even though Speldid Suns isn't a Kite Runner, I can't wait for the next book.

0385751060|3.0|This book is impressive in many ways, from the simplicity of it's cover, to the larger size print and roughly hewn paper.  That's just it's appearance.    The child like point of view of the writing is both endearing and easy to follow.  Hidden in the child like interpretation of events and 'miss pronunciation' of words by the story-teller lie some of the secrets and clues to the real underlying harshness of the situation.    When the reader realises the harsh reality of the events described, there is a a very real sympathy evoked towards both the storyteller and the persecuted individuals and race who are the real victims in this story.    The 'innocent' descriptions of events as well as personalities, behaviours and attitudes of characters, from the point of view of a young boy, are in fact powerful portrayals of racial and religious discrimination and persecution at their worst.    Young readers, who may not be aware of the real historical events that are represented in this story, will more than likely want to know more, once they have pieced together the facts that lie beneath the surface of this storyline.     There are lessons for humanity and mankind in this book.      This book would be easily read by young and adult readers alike
B00005JKG9|5.0|Rare indeed is the chance to see Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin and Al Pacino on stage all at the same time. But here it is. This film of the famous David Mamet play is a painful look at the world of high-pressure sales. You're only as good as your last close, your last deal, your last whatever--such is the harsh message of Mamet's play. Filmed as if the characters are onstage, the action takes place in a day--a rainy depressing evening and the following deceptively sunny morning. Everyone's a victim--the customers, the salesmen, the office manager, even the guy from \\"downtown.\\" Blinded by need or greed, these men can't escape the endless cycle of boom and bust. The film is true to the play, and although a bit slow moving at times, the performances are stunning. It's amazing to see the defeated Jack Lemmon pick up the phone and immediately morph into a smooth talking executive with a guaranteed money-making investment to sell. You'll remember it every time you listen to a sales pitch!

B000002LEE|5.0|Everyone seems to dig Jane's Addiction--ever notice that? Indie-snobs, punk-rockers, arty types, metal-heads--they all seem to agree that Jane's Addiction were pretty cool. Why is that exactly? If one listens to the band's debut studio album \\"Nothing Shocking\\" (1988) one can get a sense of why that is.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Shocking\\" is an interesting album in that it's hard to pigeonhole. People will probably use the all-generic term \\"alternative\\" to describe the album, but that label seems a little unsatisfactory. Maybe the album is arty and off-center, but it isn't like a Sonic Youth album in that it's really obscure or avant-garde. In fact, the album is loaded with infectious hooks and terrific solos, and the album rocks, and rocks hard. Therefore, a guitar aficionado who is a fan of Van Halen or Hendrix, or just of guitar rock in general, is going to dig \\"Nothing Shocking\\" as much as the Sonic Youth/Velvet Underground crowd.<br /><br />Additionally, \\"Nothing Shocking\\" has attracted many fans and praise no doubt because of the album's unique flavor. \\"Nothing Shocking\\" can sometimes be very gentle and soothing, and then, just like that, it's aggressive and even ferocious. Elements of jazz, new-age and funk are interspersed throughout.  It's a very unpredictable album and one never knows exactly what will come next. The sound of the album is spacey, yet full; it's abstract, yet at the same time it's an album that many listeners can connect with. The structures of the songs are also non-traditional in that many of them don't follow a verse-chorus-verse pattern and the listener often doesn't know where a song in going; yet everything works.<br /><br />Charismatic singer Perry Ferrell has a wholly unique voice that's really hard to describe. It's higher than that of most singers, and not really \\"full,\\" yet carries everything on the album just fine. Ferrell's lyrics are not easily comprehensible, yet they don't sound pretentious either. He's not speaking in gibberish, he has something to say, yet it takes some thought to try to figure it out.<br /><br />Guitarist Dave Navaro's solos are awesome and the dude obviously is a terrific player--yet he shows restraint, making sure that the killer solos avoid grandiosity and are just one element in the band's sound. Drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery provide and exciting and unpredictable rhythm section.<br /><br />\\"Up the Beach,\\" a three minute instrumental sets the perfect tone for the album--spacey, eerie and psychedelic. It's peaceful yet with an undercurrent of disharmony. \\"Ocean Size\\" is one of the album's more straight-forward rockers. It is one long, hard-hitting song, with gentle acoustic strumming sprinkled here and there. \\"Had a Dad\\" starts out hitting hard, but then a colorful, lush chorus kicks in, throwing the listener for a loop. \\"Ted, Just Admit it\\" is one of the album's more off-beat songs. It starts out unhurried, with a jazzy bass-line leading the listener through over noodling guitars, and then, almost without knowing what has hit you, the song suddenly becomes chaotic and there is a feeling of entropy. The lyrics are rather abstract and low-key, until around the middle when Ferrell repeats \\"sex is violent\\" over and over again, like a mantra. The drum solo and hectic soloing add to the feeling of disorder. The funk-laden \\"Standing in the Shower thinking\\" has a touch of Red Hot Chili Peppers to it and moves the album along nicely. The subdued, sleepy hypnotic \\"Summertime Rolls,\\" much like the opening \\"Up the Beach\\" is tranquil, yet with a feeling of unease. The hard-rocking \\"Mountain Song\\" has a Led Zeppelin-like riff and vibe but with psychedelic underpinnings. The album takes a 140 degree turn for the jazzy/funky \\"Idiots Rule.\\" The saxophone, trumpet and trombone blend in perfectly and add a really quirky but cool touch to the album. Jane's Addiction's most well-known song, the acoustic melancholy \\"Jane Says,\\" tells the story of a woman with a heroin addiction. While the song is a modern/alternative rock staple, it never seems to get old. The jazzy minute long off-beat \\"Thank you Boys\\" is kind of strange and comes out of nowhere, but its inclusion works. Another abstract song, the closing \\"Pigs in Zen\\" makes for a good conclusion.<br /><br />Released in 1988, \\"Nothing Shocking\\" sounds as fresh today as it did nearly twenty years ago and is one of the least dated albums I can think of. And while it has sold two million copies, and received much praise, it still manages to hold the allure of cult status. No matter what kind of music you are into, \\"Nothing Shocking\\" is an essential purchase.  Hopefully a new generation of fans that are currently being force-fed Nickeback will discover the album.rn/alternative rock staple, it never seems to get old.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|There are so many artists releasing CD's left and right, but none of them can even come close to this one! I have been a Kelly Clarkson fan since American Idol and her last 2 CDs (\\"Thankful\\" and \\"Breakaway\\") were great, but she really has done something special with this CD! This is by far one of the best CDs to be released in the last few years. Kelly has decided to take her sound in a new direction and it was quite a smart move; this rock/accoustic sound suits her so well.   The CD Breakdown:    1) \\"Never Again\\" (3.5/5)-- Probably my least favorite song on the whole CD. I am not going to say it is a bad song because I do like it...but compared to the rest of the CD...it is the weakest song. This is about an ex-boyfriend and how wrong he did her.    2) \\"One Minute\\" (4.5/5)--One of the best tracks; could be good for a single. This song is really fun!This song is about a guy who can't make up his mind.    3) \\"Hole\\" (5/5)--Reminds me of Alanis Morissette...which is one of the best female artists of all times! This song is one of the best songs on the cd. This song is about a \\"hole\\" inside of her...kinda sonds like it is eating away at her.    4) \\"Sober\\" (5/5)--This song is so powerful and she makes you feel what she is singing! One of the best song lyrically on this cd! What a great play on words....using \\"sober\\" to describe not being addicted to a guy. This song can really be applied to anything you are addicted to and just trying to get get over.     5)--\\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" (4/5)--This song is pretty good...the lyrics are just so good. It asks a question we all wonder sometimes...\\"Friend / What does that even mean?\\"     6)\\"Judas\\" (10/5)--THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD! I thought the lyrics were just so perfect. I rarely find a song that hits me the way this one did. I just couldn't believe how good it was! This song is about somone stabbing her in the back...love the title.    7) \\"Hanunted\\" (4/5)--Love the lyrics! sounds like it could have been on the \\"Breakaway\\" CD. This song is about trying to find someone when you really need them..but they are nowhere to be found.    8)\\"Be Still\\" (4/5)--A very sweet ballad...but it seems like it doesn't belong on this CD; but good none the less.     9) \\"Maybe\\" (5/5)--This song is one of the best on the CD! The lyrics are just so great...not really a rock sounding like the rest of the CD.     10) \\"How I Feel\\" (3.5/5)--I like this song...but it doesn't feel like it really fits her voice. (This sounds like a No Doubt song)    11) \\"Yeah: (4.5/5)--I heard this song live at her concert in '06 and it was much better than the CD version. I LOVE THE SONG....but for the CD release they totally messed up the chorus....WHAT IS WITH THE HORNS?!?    12)\\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" (4/5)--I Love this song! It is so cute and would be a good radio single!    13)\\"Irvine\\" (15/5)--THE BEST KELLY CLARKSON SONG EVER! I love the unfinished quality to it...this song is just....so good...words can't describe it....A MUST HEAR!!!!    *BONUS TRACK* \\"Chivas\\" (4/5) A cute song....kinda sounds like she was singing it at a Karoke bar but that is what makes it so great! I thought this song was more light hearted than most of the other songs!    OVER ALL--- I can't imagine this CD could have been any better! I think she should keep up the good fight and listen to her own voice; it worked very well for her on this project!     I LOVE YA KELLY!!!! (KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK)
B000P2A24W|5.0|I have been a HUGE Bon Jovi fan for their entire career and they still continue to put out great music!! This cd has songs from the heart that you can rock to, songs that you can relate to, and songs that can inspire you just as Bon Jovi has always done.  It may have a little \\"country\\" sound to it, but it is still Jon and his band putting out what they feel and no one does it better than they do.  His voice sounds amazing and there isn't one song that I don't love.  His CMT \\"Unplugged\\" special is a must see too as his performances of new and old songs is great.  I especially liked his jazzy touch to You Give Love A Bad Name as well as his moves.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Note to reader: If you are incapable of liking any music that isn't a mainstream, in-your-face obvious hit, then you won't like this record. Come back once you've grown up and have acquired some taste.    \\"My December\\" is a stunning gem in a world of repetitive, over-hyped music. Kelly Clarkson has hung up her \\"Idol\\" badge once and for all and has released the singer/songwriter within.    This album is full of songs with many layers and dimensions...from the dance/rocker \\"One Minute\\" to the Ska-pop inspired \\"How I feel.\\" Other treats include the sexy Soul-funk \\"Yeah\\" and the glitched, crunching rock of \\"Haunted.\\" Each song offers something new and different that we had never seen from Clarkson in the past. A must-listen goes to the lyrically superior \\"Sober.\\" The song plays like a beautiful flowing stream that gradually builds into a mind-blowing vocal waterfall. And sure, she has her angry moments--but who doesn't? \\"Hole\\" and \\"Judas\\" would nestle wonderfully on any Alt-rock station. This album is emotional and confessional, a perfect paradim would be the singer/songwriter sound exemplified \\"Maybe,\\" containing the lyrics \\"I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found.\\"    While the entire record deserves every spin it gets, one must take the time to listen to the chilling, heartbreaking \\"Irvine.\\" From the lyrics to the vocals, this song is every bit what a closing song should do for an album: make you feel the journey with the artist. (By the way, you have to stick around for the hilarious hidden track \\"Chivas\\").    My December would not work for anyone else because this is a Kelly Clarkson record from the first to the last second. She has upped the ante by expanding her musical horizons and by delivering vocally in ways we have never heard her before on her past records (or on that one show for sure).    I'm not sure if this is a generational thing...but this is what an album looks like. It is cohesive, meaningful and gives the listener insight into the mind and heart of the artist. If you are looking for \\"Breakaway,\\" then put that in your Search and listen to it. If you want \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" then go find it or put on your friggin' Kidz Bop. Otherwise, accept this record for what it is: Amazing.    Buy this record. Buy this record. BUY. THIS. RECORD.

1594489505|5.0|As a very hard-to-please English teacher of thirty-plus years, I find most contemporary novels disappointing in both style and story.  Not so with this one!  I think it ranks with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, THE GRAPES OF WRATH, and BLACK BOY in its evocation of time and place.  Sitting in my suburban back yard tonight, I cannot get the story out of my mind.  Americans are, unfortunately, often insulated from the true plight of so many of our bretheren on this earth.  Hosseini's novel speaks particularly to women, who will not be able to forget the story of what our Afghani sisters have had to endure.  Read the first half for information, and then settle in for an emotional roller-coaster.  I cannot imagine that you will be disappointed in this well-written, evocative, and touching story.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|The album as a whole is a cohesive unit telling a very personal, yet relatable, story throughout.  Mainly, Clarkson comments that life is full of a lot of downers, but there are nonetheless better times when one can really prove one's perseverance.  That said, Clarkson incorporates several tones in reliving tales of betrayal, anger, loneliness, human faults, and times of \\"picking\\" the \\"weeds.\\"  Clarkson and her team masterfully intertwine these traits and others into each song on the album.  Yet, the genius behind Clarkson's lyrics plays a role as well: Clarkson never narrows her songs' topics, but rather constructs her songs with simpler, easily relatable phrasing.  Listeners are not thwarted away from actually conceiving that they know and understand what Clarkson feels and sings.        \\"Never Again\\"--Clarkson masterfully demonstrates angst with fervor.  Her references of sorts to Christian practices (\\"repent yourself away\\" and \\"give me that Sunday school answer\\") all the more prove what an ingenious lyricist Clarkson can be; after all, the male subject being scorned is now a member of a contemporary Christian band.  While these lyrics narrow the song a bit, the remainder of the lyrics remain general, allowing any listener who has been cheated on to easily identify with Clarkson.  While the chorus may seem to lack a catchy melody, Clarkson does seem to chant the chorus rather convincingly.    \\"One Minute\\"--The music and lyrics of this song focus entirely on juxtaposition and high contrast.  While the song may seem dark lyrically, Clarkson is actually quite easily discussing the ups and downs of life; accordingly, the music itself is rather sing-songy.  The music parallels the idea behind the lyrics.  While the hook is bare, Clarkson easily covers for that shortcoming through the tremendously addicting chorus.  The song remains in listeners' ears far after the song's conclusion.     \\"Hole\\"--The chorus is simple: \\"There's a hole/ inside of me/ it's so [damn] cold/slowing killing me.\\"  It's succinct, simple, and easy to remember.  What's more, Clarkson has actually placed \\"holes\\" in between each line of the chorus.  There are short breaks after each line.  The lyrics remain simple, yet detailed enough to sense Clarkson's sense of emptiness and desire for a new beginning.  The rockier edge of the song brings life to the album, even if the subject matter is darker.  It's hard to not bobble your head around while enjoying the music.      \\"Sober\\"--This song creates a new mood for the album.  Clarkson manages to softly, yet powerfully, display one essence of human life: one must drag out the garbage and put in a new, clean bag.  The music is captivating, while the lyrics remain inspiring.  The entire thesis of the song, and perhaps the album, (I picked all my weeds/ but kept the flowers), breathes new life into listeners, providing hope through the idea that one truly can \\"wake up\\" and ditch the negativity in life.  Clarkson's explosive, emotional ending to the song emotes a genuine sense of cleansing that convinces even the most drunk of alcoholics that a better day is to come.      \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\"--This is one of Clarkson's poppy contributions to the album.  The song delves into quite general subject matter: bad friends.  We've all had them, easily making the song relatable for even the must dreary of listeners.  While the song doesn't get as explosive at the chorus as perhaps I would have preferred, Clarkson's captivating voice is able to dig the song out of that ditch; the ending of the song is the most convincing part of the song.  While Clarkson's main vocal track adds fresher lyrics infused with lyrical background vocals, the song becomes more believable and catchy.      \\"Judas\\"--\\"Judas\\" returns to one of the themes found in \\"Never Again\\": betrayal.  While the beginning lyrics introduce the biblical character's background, the chorus of the song interestingly relies on repetition. The repeating of the chorus' firstlines and middle lines is reminiscent of a knife's stabbing motions, similar to Brutus' betrayal of Caesar.  Portions of the instrumental music wave in and out, similar to stabbing motions, or even the fact that betrayal implies the appearance of one thing but the truth is actually unknown.  Clarkson's vocals portray shock and anger, especially as Clarkson enters a series of \\"ohs.\\"  The ending of the song (\\"You let me down\\") wave downward, just as Clarkson feels the person has let her down.      \\"Haunted\\"--This song is loaded with perfect production features that create the haunted mood the title refers to.  The opening is just as creepy as when Clarkson whispers \\"Where are you/ I need you\\" just after the hook.  Background vocals in between verses and choruses are quite convincing as well in setting the haunted mood as Clarkson cries, \\"Oh, inside\\" and \\"He was mine.\\"  Clarkson's vocals soar throughout the song, setting into play the desperation that Clarkson feels toward the absence of her friend that committed suicide.      \\"Be Still\\"--This song is not only a vocal gem on the album, but also a lyrical beauty.  The song is appropriately subdued throughout, never over climaxing.  In fact, the climax of the song is when Clarkson slowly moans, \\"Slow it down.\\"  Clarkson desires one still moment in life to allow her a chance to have a moment for herself, something Clarkson manages to incorporate both through her captivating lyrics and the gentleness of the music itself.      \\"Maybe\\"--\\"Maybe\\" is a rare song that steps out of the verse, bridge, chorus, hook, verse, chorus, et cetera formula.  This highly benefits the artistic outreach and control Clarkson sought on the record.  The song contains two halves the weave masterfully into one, brilliant piece.  The first half of the song is restrained and presents that there is a change between two lovers if the chance is just given.  Meanwhile, the song's second half begins with the line \\"I'm confusing as hell.\\" Here, Clarkson bares all, emotionally laying down imperfections she, or perhaps the speaker of the song, has.  String instruments heighten the emotion the song portrays as Clarkson begins, \\"One day/ we'll meet again/ and you'll need me.\\"  The song has hope in this line, yet bitterness in the line \\"I most certainly don't need to be found/ I'm not lost.\\"  Clarkson takes into account several faults a person can have, adding depth and sincerity to the song.      \\"How I Feel\\"--This next track appropriately follows \\"Maybe\\" as Clarkson ends \\"Maybe\\" with one reference to fire and begins this next song with a mention of fire.  Clarkson seems to have a knack for touching the fire and taking risks.   While \\"Maybe\\" is Clarkson's attempt to prove that she can just perhaps be in a relationship, \\"How I Feel\\" contrasts that sentiment, allowing Clarkson to wail that she has difficulty finding a man to love.  Yet, the song is upbeat and Clarkson's tone remains mocking throughout.  Clarkson is, indeed, claiming that the situation has become so dire and repetitious that it is actually a situation worthy of mockery.  The music remains catchy and awesomely sarcastic throughout, any listener can have fun poking fun at Clarkson's burning desire for a lover, or a lack of one.      \\"Yeah\\"--This is a fun track, waving bluesy elements with pop fun.  The song relates to Clarkson's relationship during which her male counterpart just could not accept the fact that Clarkson is a celebrity.  Clarkson cries in desperation for her lover to \\"Let [her] know\\" just what she can do to ease him up.  Clarkson emotionally delivers a hook that is both fun to listen to and to sing along to; while wordy, Clarkson lyrics are full of detail the bring listeners closer to the situation.  Again, Clarkson relies on juxtaposition as she wails, \\"I want to feel you/ but I feel empty.\\"  Her change in key in her last wail of \\"yeah\\" seemingly employs desperation as well in the song.      \\"Can I Have a Kiss\\"--\\"Can I Have a Kiss\\" is lyrically strong as well as musically interactive.  Listeners can easily get lost in Clarkson's expressive \\"Don't move.\\" The verse and chorus are actually about two different people, but that does not distract the song's overall message that Clarkson portrays: sometimes one feels that he has made too many mistakes but still wants an opportunity to fix things. The song is about hope, about getting a chance to accomplish something that may be out of one's league.  While the kiss can be a metaphor for that, is can also be quite literal.  Nonetheless, Clarkson's vocals remain pure and untouchable.  The song's conclusion cements Clarkson as one of the most persuasive vocalists of our time: her simple desire for a kiss reveals rare authenticity that exacerbates Clarkson's want for her chance and opportunity.      \\"Irvine\\"--This is the most touching song on the album.  The vocals are raw and expressive, giving off the dead feeling that Clarkson must have felt while crying on the floor in a bathroom of an arena.  The guitar is a simple touch and all the song really needs to soar.  As Clarkson prays throughout the song, she touches all her listeners' souls, allowing even the liveliest of human beings to recall their lowest points.      \\"Chivas\\"--This song is beyond tongue-and-cheek it's hilarious.  Clarkson is crafty not only lyrically, but vocally as well.  Clarkson sounds as though she has perhaps hit the sauce the night she wrote and sang this song.  It's an outstanding hidden track that simply weaves into the album the lasting hope behind having alternative options: Chivas looks mighty fine after the emotions behind such songs as \\"Irvine.\\"

1594489505|5.0|I loved Kite Runner and was not surprised that I equally loved Hosseini's new A Thousand Splendid Suns. It was the most powerful and griping story I have ever read. As a mother of a young child there were parts that made my legs weak and stomach turn - half way across the world, a different time, a different life and yet I felt these women's heartaches so acutely. I wept when it was over - in part for the characters in the book and in part because I didn't want it to end! How long will the wait be for Hosseini's next novel? I can't wait!!

I know that Kelly wanted her fans to know that she is a woman of many talents.      She can sing and write songs, not many can say that and not many can make it works she has talent.  I'm pround of her and I will continue to support all of her current and future songs.

The author writes in a clear and sometimes humorous way, inserting personal anecdotes and observations about life.  His broad education and cultural background give his words a nice edge.  A good black swan for your library.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Good lord, where to begin. I saw this movie in theatres the second it opened here in Toronto; I wasn't particularly interested in the British Royal Family prior to having seen it and I didn't know much about Helen Mirren at all; I'd only seen her in Calendar Girls, but I thought the subject matter would be interesting and I was curious as to how they'd manage to pull off a depiction of Queen Elizabeth II.     I love this movie. I love everything about this movie, from the writing to the directing to the acting - especially the acting. Michael Sheen is terrific and captures the younger Tony Blair's boyish charm, enthusiasm, and knack for being in touch with what the public wants. James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms were great as Prince Phillip and the late Queen Mum, respectively, and Alex Jennings was adequate as Prince Charles; he at least half-convinced me that he was a whiner, which is what my opinion of Prince Charles was and still is. However, this movie of course belongs to Helen Mirren, who is a goddess of acting. She pefectly captures Queen Elizabeth II's grace, dignity, sense of duty, and dry wit, and manages to convey the sense of bewilderment that one would assume is natural for a person to feel when people who've loved you all your life suddenly hate you for doing what you think is appropriate. Regardless of Queen E's personal feelings about the late Princess Di, she did not stay holed up at Balmoral out of spite; she stayed there because she wanted to keep what was going on private. She doesn't believe in big public displays of emotion and never has, and prior to Princess Diana's death, the British public were by and large all right with that. How was she to know that in the blink of an eye, she was to abandon the way she'd always done things and behave in a manner that she considers to be distasteful?    This is a smart, sharp film, that tries to convey to the audience that no one is perfect, that everyone is human, and that everyone in it tried to do whatthey thought was right - and it reminds you that people have different ideas of what is right. For Tony Blair, it was obvious that the Queen needed to make more of an effort to convey that she was sad. For Queen E, it never occurred to her to express her feelings (aside from the statement of regret that had already been issued, which the movie does not make clear) in any other manner than was her custom: dignified, quiet, and private. The film is very informative and accurate, and everything about it is elegant and tasteful. Helen Mirren and the entire cast rule.

0151013047|5.0|I can not remember reading such a simple story that managed to be so tightly paced and so loaded with prolonged, steady, suspense.  The crafting is original and gripping, but that's only the half of why reading this short novel is so worthwhile.    Other reviewers here have given a lot of info on the plot, and I won't repeat it or produce any spoilers.  I do want to address why this is a good book to read right now.    Readers (ostensibly westerners) cannot help but come away from protagonist's friendly storytelling without thinking at least a little differently about America's image in the world.  War on Terror, Terrorism, Fundamentalism: the media and government use these terms to a point where we are numbed to the issues behind them.  What better way to get a handle on what makes enmity, than to sit down and listen to someone in the position of enemy.  Did America put this man in that position, or did he?   It's not simple.      If you can't visit Pakistan, if you can't talk to a Pakistani, read this book.
B000EPR7NE|3.0|If there is one good thing that I can actually say about the film adaptation of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", it is by far Hans Zimmer's lush, orchestral film score for the film. I wasn't all that impressed with the film (much less the book itself). The only negative thing I can honestly say about the score is that the music is almost too subtle and quiet which makes it a bit difficult to listen to on one's ipod. A lot of Zimmer's scores tends to be loud and bombastic but surprisingly enough this is not the case with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". There are still occasional bombastic moment but they are few and far between. Regardless of the minor flaws, the soundtrack is laced with a lush tapestry of orchestral melodies and operatic vocals reminiscent of Mediaeval Baebes like on \\"Salvete Virgines\\". My personal favorite song on the album is the epic \\"CheValiers De Sangreal\\". I just love how dramatic the melody is. I think I would have enjoyed this soundtrack even more so if it was edited slightly to just under an hour. A little over an hour was a bit too long for me but overall great soundtrack.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly Clarkson's \\"My December\\" received a lot of early attention after she decided to distance herself from her label's suggestions and assume complete artistic control over the album, writing or co-writing every song on the album.  Many, including her label, speculated that such a decision would have disastrous results on album sales.  While I agree that \\"My December\\" will not be as commercially successful as 2004's Breakaway, musically, it is definitely the superior album.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"Never Again,\\" there are no real standout singles on the album that I can see receiving much radio airplay, and forget about any of these songs appearing in \\"The Princess Diaries 3.\\"  All of the songs appear to be focused on the lyrics, and the music is designed to emphasize that rather than repeat a catchy chorus over and over.  Many of these songs don't even have a recognizable chorus.<br /><br />The whole album has the feel of \\"scorned angry rocker chick\\" and most of the songs seem to be directed to men in the form of angry shouting.  Most of the songs on \\"My December\\" have a hard-rocking, almost industrial/goth sound and deal with heartbreak and rejection.  Much like the video for \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" only this time instead of smashing up an ex's apartment she's cutting his brake lines and killing his dog.  Although it does seem at first that Clarkson is shouting pretty much through the entire album, her voice is so powerful that it might be more fair to see she is just projecting really forcefully, and it works for her, much more than when done by someone like Avril Lavigne or Pink.  Clarkson may have one of the best voices in female rock today.<br /><br />1. Never Again - The first single off the album. A very powerful rock song about a woman who's been dumped, and wanting him to regret his decision and be in pain because of it.  This is supposedly inspired by Clarkson's relationship with David Hodges.  The video for this complements the lyrics really well.  This is the only song on the album I really see as a potential radio \\"hit,\\" and not a big one at that.<br /><br />2. One Minute - Very fast paced and sounds a lot like a Madonna song.  I could see this being reissued as a club mix or something.<br /><br />3. Hole - This refrain on this song sounds a little bit like \\"One Minute,\\" and shouldn't have been placed right after that song in my opinion.  Clarkson's backup vocals sing against hers on the majority of this song.  The chorus is kind of catchy but I got bored with it after about 5 listens and the musical arrangement is so awkward I'd be fine with not listening to it ever again.<br /><br />4. Sober - The second single off the album. This is a typical rock ballad about survival and not giving into temptation.  I really don't understand why they decided to make this a single, but I guess after \\"Never Again\\" there are not too many other choices.  It's a decent song, but the problem is that the hook isn't until 2 minutes into th song.  That is too long for a single.  When I first listened to this album I skipped over this song several times because I got bored waiting for something interesting to happen.  The first few minutes it starts out slow and then progresses into much stronger beats, then winds down slowly again with a nice cello line.  Don't look for a familiar chorus with this one either because the song changes tempo and melody several times.  It has grown on me though and I really like it now.<br /><br />5. Don't Waste Your Time - This is a more \\"light\\" rock song with a catchy chorus.<br /><br />6. Judas - I really like the arrangement on this song.  It has great lyrics and it's becoming one of my favorite songs.  I'll often restart it just to hear the first 10 seconds again.<br /><br />7. Haunted - This sounds a lot like an Evanescence song.  Great song and I'm sure a lot of 12 year old girls will be lip syncing to it on YouTube in no time.  The lyrics are some of the best on the album.<br /><br />8. BeStill - A beautiful slow ballad with a strong emphasis on Clarkson's voice.  This song is about picking yourself up when you're down and being strong. I feel like lying in a hammock on the beach when I hear this one.  I don't really know what that means.<br /><br />9. Maybe - Midtempo song.  Also sounds a bit like Evanescence.<br /><br />10. How I Feel - My favorite song on the album, about a woman scorned by an ex-lover and wanting to give up on relationships.  This is one of the more mainstream songs and has a pop/rock style with a very catchy hook.  Musically, it would have fit in very well on her previous albums.<br /><br />11. Yeah - This is a pretty good song that really could have benefited with a better orchestral arrangement.  Maybe throw a few trumpets in and a piano.  Either way though it's catchy enough to do fine without it.<br /><br />12. Can I Have a Kiss? - Pretty generic for Clarkson but a good song.<br /><br />13. Irvine/Chivas - Irvine was witten on the bathroom floor after a concert in Irvine, CA on what Clarkson refers to as \\"the worst night of my life.\\"  This song is a deep ballad and is supposed to be a prayer.  For a song that is supposed to be so introspective, it is more of a vocal showcase with lyrics that could have come from an amateur poetry contest.  I also don't understand how it has a co-writing credit on it when the lyrics are so simple (and supposed to be so personal). As for \\"Chivas,\\" do we really need hidden tracks on albums anymore?  What is the point?  Sure it's great the first time you realize you get a \\"bonus\\" song, but then the excitement wears off and you get frustrated everytime you have to seek through 5:00 of the previous song just to get to it. As for the song, it's just Kelly and an acoustic guitar, and sounds like a message left on an old boyfriend's answering machine.  It's good enough  though that it should have been included as an actual track.<br /><br />\\"My December\\" will disappoint many younger American Idol fans who may be expecting a sequel to \\"Breakaway,\\" as well as her label execs, as this surely won't be anywhere near as popular with mainstream audiences.  This more mature and personal release by Clarkson does show some decent lyrical ability and shouldn't disappoint most of her longtime fans.the best on the album.  <br />  <br />8.

B000I5X81K|5.0|I'll admit, when I first heard this CD, I wasn't immediately sure what to make of it, but upon repeated listenings, I began to love it.  Josh was asserting himself: he was taking chances and testing new areas.  Quite frankly, with a voice like his, he can't go wrong.  I had the pleasure of seeing him in concert this past March at Madison Square Garden, and while I was a wee bit disappointed that he didn't do a few more of the \\"older\\" songs, he did do practically the entire \\"Awake\\" album, and let me tell you, the man sounds exactly the same in person as he does on CD and he made converts out of the people around me who were still on the fence about the album.  And when Ladysmith Black Mambazo came out to do \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Weeping,\\" the roof was practically blasted off the place!  There are many entertainers who don't quite sound live like they do on their recordings (Madonna comes to mind), but Josh is not one of them.  This album is certainly a departure from his first two, but I think he was right to take the chance.  He proved he can sing anything.  My favorites off the album are \\"In Her Eyes\\" (one of the best things he's ever done), \\"Mai,\\" \\"Weeping,\\" and \\"You Are Loved.\\"  This album is fresh and interesting.  Besides, it's Josh.  He could sing the phone book and have you begging for more, right?

1575666286|5.0|Were I so unfortunate as to find myself with a cancer, this is the only program I would follow.  Forty years ago my prognosis was a life expectancy of maybe 3 months -- if I was lucky. Arteriosclerosis was then considered by medical doctors as irreversible, yet here I am, 40 years later, because someone pointed me in a different direction, one very similar to Gerson's.  I bought several copies since you run into the incurable all the time.  We live in a sick society -- in more ways than one.
B00002NDB1|5.0|I believe this album had a lot of expectations from the critics, and there was a lot of hype and promotion put into this album because the record company was still worried about the loss of Bruce Dickenson in the Line up.  It was undue pressure, because I believe Maiden already showed the world that life without Dickenson existed, and X Factor was great.  This album is no Exception.  Shorter, with only 8 songs, but full of faster songs (Angel and the Gambler and Future Real), and instant classics still in the set list today (THE CLANSMAN).  This work is on par with the stuff relesed on brave new world and or Dance of Death, but some people do not give it credit because of this being Blaze.  This is a great album, and was the first Maiden CD format I purchase (also my first enhanced CD), and I am very pleased.  Now I own about 3 versions of this album, and it makes regular turns in my play cycle.  Check this out, you will not be dissapointed.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|True, most will say, it is less mainstream as her sophomore hit, Breakaway. But this CD, WOAH, it so much deeper, the lyrics are personal ('Why can't you just take me?/I don't have much to go/Before I fade completely.'-Irvine)  and are written by Kelly herself. Whoever said these songs aren't catchy? Of course they are! Maybe not as catchy as Since U Been Gone, or Walk Away, but catchy isn't everything. Some hip hop songs are catchy (My Humps for example) but that doesn't make them good songs. Kelly is a great artist and she'll surely have more CDs to come.   <br />  <br /> Never Again 5/5 Great lead single, maybe my favorite.   <br /> One Minute 4/5 A little too commerical for me, but a good song.   <br /> Hole 5/5 Good song about sadness  <br /> Sober 5/5 Maybe better then Never Again, but One Minute should have been the second single (its a more catchy song, this should have been third).   <br /> Don't Waste Your Time 4.5/5 A nice poppy song   <br /> Judas 5/5 Like this song about betrayal  <br /> Haunted 5/5 Darker sound, like it!   <br /> Be Still 4.5/5 Nice softer song  <br /> Maybe 5/5 Love this song, its just great  <br /> How I Feel 4/5 nice, but again a little too poppy for me  <br /> Yeah 3/5 Worst song on the album, a little too funky for me  <br /> Can I Have A Kiss 5/5 Great, good acoustic song  <br /> Irvine 5/5 Most personal dark song on the album  <br />  <br /> Chivas *Hidden Track* 4/5 Different song, but not as good as Irvine.

0316010669|5.0|Gladwell's focus in Blink is on snap decisions.  Rather than a reliance on the slow rational process, snap decisions come from gut feelings, intuition, or as Gladwell puts it, behind the \\"locked door\\" of your unconsciousness.  Why are some are absolutely right on and others so wrong?  Gladwell states three aims for his book.  First is to make the case for the accuracy of snap decisions.  Second is to be able to understand why some snap decisions are good and others poor.  Third, that we all can improve the quality of our snap decisions.    What differentiates the good versus bad decisions, i.e. intuition versus prejudicial judgments?  Accurate information, understanding which among all that information are the few crucial keys, and practice.  Sounds almost contradictory, but the ability to make good snap judgments involves a lot of work!    Blink is well-written.  I've heard others complain it is superficial, but I feel he does an excellent job making science accessible without oversimplification (and he footnotes extensively, in case you want to read the original research).    If you're expecting \\"improve your SNAP in 30 days,\\" you'll be disappointed.  At his best depicting the good, the bad and the ugly, Gladwell is not explicit in prescribing a course to improve the quality of our decisions.  He depicts it anecdotally.      I read Blink with an eye towards incorporating it's lessons in the self-defense classes I teach.  Every self-defense situation mandates decisions made in the blink of an eye. Rational thought is slow, so other brain pathways take over when we sense danger, increasing our adrenaline and preparing the body for action.  You feel these effects:  quickened breathing and pulse rates, tightening of the throat, chest, or abdomen, nausea, and many others.  Every self-defense instructor exhorts students to pay close attention to these gut feelings, also called intuition.  Yet how in the midst of an adrenaline rush can we distinguish intuition from a panic response?  Is there a logic behind the difference, and a way to improve one's intuitive skills?  The next-to-last chapter, focusing on the shooting death of Amadou Diallo in 1999 by New York police officers, describes how we read other people we feel may be a threat, how our bodies react under stress, and practices that police and security people can practice to help---or worsen---already bad situations.  We are left to infer applications into our lives.

Never Again- the first single. this is the best song ever! i absolutely love it. if you don't, you don't have a pulse!!!!! 1000000/5    2. One Minute- 5/5    3. Hole- This song is flippn' awesome! i hope it becomes a single. 5/5    4. Sober- i love this song. it is a little softer, but i think it is going to be her next single. 5/5    5. Don't Waste Your Time- 5/5    6. Judas- 5/5    7. Haunted- this song is a little dark. it reminds me of evanescence, but i love it. it is one of my favorites. 5/5    8. Be Still- 4/5    9. Maybe- 4/5    10. How I Feel- This is another great track. i can see this one as a single.     11. Yeah- i LOVE this song! this is my favorite next to \\"Never Again\\". it is a little more r&b-ish and funkier than the other songs. 10/5    12. Can I Have A Kiss- 5/5    13. Irvine- This song is a little too slow for me, but i like the hidden track. 4/5    Well, our original idol has done it again! she made another solid album. it may have taken forever to come out, but it was worth the wait. i highly reccomend this to any die-hard kelly clarkson and/or american idol fan.     hope this was helpful    June 26, 2007

0374105235|5.0|With the continue debate of Dafur and the movie \\"Blood Diamond\\" Ishmael Beah forces readers to enter a world that they choose to ignore. Beah tells his story in great detail and the images he explains are booth disturbing and sad. He is one of many child soldiers and he is the voice of those children who are recruited each day and forced to kill. This is an easy read and an important book. There are few first hand accounts of what it is like for children trying to survive in war torn countries and this gives us a sense of the horror that they live through each day.

Ian Gillan and Roger Glover would raise the bar even higher.  Before they become part of the fold, there is the tremendous second album and the self-titled third.<br /><br />\\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\" leads off the second Purple release.  Possibly, by design the record starts with the shortest tune and ends with their epic cover of a Motown classic.  \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\" Features a terrific and varied vocal by Rod Evans along with a perfect guitar solo by Blackmore.  Ritchie already is finding his way and it isn't only the ability to excel with his leads and fills but the perfect tone to coincide with the song.<br /><br />\\"Hard Road\\" also known as \\"Wring That Neck\\" is the perfect instrumental.  Blackmore is tasty with a timeless riff supported by Ian Paice's drumming and Jon Lord's  in your face but not over the top keyboards.<br /><br />\\"Kentucky Woman\\" is a wonderful cover to the Neil Diamond hit.  Purple does a well-rounded interpretation and deserves credit for not only pulling off a well-respected interpretation but also being open-minded in their selection of non-group recordings.<br /><br />\\"Exposition\\"/\\"We Can Work It Out\\" gives us two for the price of one.  Starting with their own composition of high energy- merging into a slower cover of the Beatles legendary song.  This is the second Beatles selection (\\"Help\\" was recorded on the first LP) they pulled off well.<br /><br />\\"The Shield\\" one of the best efforts from the Purple \\"Mark I\\" line-up is also contains a superlative singing job by Rod Evans.  The lyrics are intense and the clarity and conviction only further engrave them in your mind.<br /><br />\\"Anthem\\" with a mid-evil keyboard sound and a Blackmore guitar that enhances the dark mood is the most overlooked composition on the record but not any lesser.<br /><br />\\"River Deep Mountain High\\" has been interpreted by performers from all musical avenues.  The tune partially written by record producer Phil Spector has been enjoyed not only by Motown fans (Four Tops, Supremes, and Ike & Tina Turner) but also by those having purchased records by the Animals, Harry Nilsson, and Bob Seger.  Deep Purple's ten minute journey is the most adventurous of all the renditions.  It could have been easily too long if they were anything less.  With the Blackmore/Lord combination, it takes on a life of its own.  Never is there a passage you call superfluous.  A climatic ending to a great production.<br /><br />Make sure to please get the remastered version with the five bonus tracks lead by \\"Playground.\\"  Between Blackmore's aggression, Lord's perfect keyboard, and some terrific nuances by Ian Paice it is a must listen!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"rlooked composition on the record but not any lesser.      \\"River Deep Mountain High\\" has been interpreted by performers from all musical avenues.

B000E1MTZE|5.0|First let me say I know there are alot of people out there who think only the first movie in this trilogy is any good. I somewhat agree with that statement. True the sequels were not as good as whole movies as the first. But they are full of scenes that rule,and with the power of a DVD remote I become the ultimate film editor.  Ill skip boring sequences and just get right to good stuff. Sometimes in reloaded I forget Zion even exists cause I skip right thru it.  The picture quality is amazing on all 3 movies and I use it for demo material to show off my system all the time.  I highly recommend this purchase.

B000QEILLK|4.0|The Road Back Home is a two-disc compilation album put together by Flower Kings leader Roine Stolt. Not only does it feature the band's relatively more compact and \\"easy listening\\" cuts, the songs have also been treated to a new mixing job by Stolt. Add to that several newly recorded guitar solos as well as some backing vocals by Roine Stolt and Hasse Froberg. Some of the numbers have just been remixed whilst some others also feature previously unheard passages, instrumentation, and vocal parts.<br /><br />The song long-time fans will want to hear the most will probably be \\"Little Deceiver\\", a leftover from the band's Rainmaker sessions. It is an interesting experiment where the tune wanders off more into Dire Straits-goes-country territory, bringing forth a true solo statement from Stolt and Froberg who are responsible for everything this song has to offer: unusual harmony vocals, cool loops and sound effects, and steady, straightforward drumming.<br /><br />Also new on the CD is the band's Genesis tribute \\"Cinema Show\\", originally recorded in 1998. Being one of the greatest Genesis songs ever, Stolt says the band was rather nervous while recording it, but the result is nothing short of mindblowing. The acoustic guitar tone, the layered melodies, the awesome vocal parts, and last but not the least, Tomas Bodin's mindblowingly beautiful key solo that not only honours Tony Banks' original work but also adds its own touch to it -- everything is phenomenal about this piece. As noted in the liner notes, that solo is testimony that \\"great keys can be played with emotion without a trace of blues or jazz\\".<br /><br />It would be impossible and meaningless to describe each song on this compilation. After all, they all represent a different era of the band; and they are meant to be enjoyed best in their original context. However, the little nuances brought out in the mixing stage do warrant a mention. \\"Cosmic Lover\\", for instance, features new vocal and some clarinet addition as well as a heavier focus on rhythm. This brings out the funky aesthetic and underscores the brilliant Beatles-like vocal harmony. \\"Stupid Girl\\" has a brand new guitar solo; and truth be told, I can't choose which one I like better cause the new one is truly sublime. Also, the guitar solo of \\"A Kings Prayer\\", one of the greatest Flower Kings songs ever, is different. I love how the deep message is conveyed on this one amidst glimmering acoustic guitar notes and McCartney-like vocal arrangements.<br /><br />The last few minutes of \\"Church of Your Heart\\" have been cut off, and rightly so. The result is a more direct and powerful tune driven by tons of organ work by Bodin and soaring harmonies by Hasse Froberg. The African tribal rhythms merge seamlessly with a gorgeous soprano sax arrangement on \\"Grand Old World\\" whilst \\"Monkey Business\\" proves once again why everything on Unfold the Future is gold. Jonas Reingold's fretless bass, Hasse Bruniusson's percussion rhythms, and Stolt's unmistakable guitars form the musical aspect of the otherwise tragic lyrical theme. Stolt's vocal part in the intro of \\"The Road Back Home\\" has been replaced by Hasse's more fitting singing -- perhaps the best Retropolis song with its melodic hook and blazing Hammond elements.<br /><br />The songs with Pain of Salvation's Daniel Gildenlow providing backing harmonies have mostly been left untouched, such as \\"Starlight Man\\" and \\"Cosmic Circus\\", but you can still tell a remix was done on them. The somewhat cluttered soundscape layering of the former piece seems totally gone on the reworked version of \\"Different People\\" off of Stardust We Are. Unlike the original version, the piece has a stronger psychedelic centre here thanks to Stolt's meticulous remixing, and the melodious flow is more evocative. The backing voices have enhanced this cut greatly as well.<br /><br />It doesn't matter whether you're a long-time fan or a new listener. Any Flower Kings fan should pick this up in a heart beat and hear these songs in their new format. If you have never heard any of Flower Kings' studio albums, on the other hand, then, depending on the songs you like the best here, you should go and pick it up impromptu. Once you're hooked, you'll want to have their entire discography anyway.<br /><br />Kudos to Roine Stolt for not only compiling and remixing all these songs, but also for the detailed song-by-song analysis he offers in the liner notes. He even designed the booklet and cover art himself and added some photos as well. The packaging is superb -- it couldn't be any better.<br /><br />I wish all compilation albums were this amazing.you have never heard any of Flower Kings' studio albums, on the other hand, then, depending on the songs you like the best here, you should go and pick it up impromptu.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|unbelievable shots and very interesting Amazing just what is on our planet.  One of BBC best series.  Educational and entertaining all in one.  Must see for everyone.  The years it took to get some of the shots makes you appreciate it all the more.
0743277457|5.0|As someone who has struggled with mental obstacles in different parts of my life, I truly appreciated the insights that Waitzkin has to offer. This isn't a generic \\"improve your life now\\" book. Rather, the principles come from someone who has competed and succeeded at the highest levels. It also is very readable. You're going to have a hard time putting it down.
B000O77RLE|4.0|Letters is a great movie for history buffs.  It brings a new perspective to the genre. Great cast and story.  The only bugs I had with this movie are that the movie has a very dark setting, lots of blacks and grays. Not much to look at with the HD version. I was alittle disappointed with the menu and bonus features. The presentation was cheaply done and there are little to no features.
0345494768|5.0|This book is a treasure trove, filled with tons of wonderful material that people like me have been waiting THIRTY YEARS to see!  I recommend it for anybody who loves Star Wars, and who wants to learn about the making of the film that started it all.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time un cut it was fantastic.  The HD version is far more than I had anticipated.  The story is much more complex and makes much more sense. It seems the original release was a dumb-down version of the real story.  Picture quality is amazingly clear with lush colors. Even if you have this movie on DVD it is worth getting for Blu ray. You dont know what you are missing
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you are even remotely interested in this earth of ours, this series is mind-boggeling.  Few things you can pick up and watch so intently; this is one of them.  You are there for every climatic change, every season, every sweeping arc on this earth.  It is Noah's Ark for the whole Planet.  This is the DVD I would take with me if I could only take one!
0743289412|4.0|After everything was said and done I actually enjoyed this story.  The language between Lisey and Scott didn't really bother me and it did take about a chapter or two before the pace started to pick up in the story.  After her flashback of the shovel scene don't give up reading the book.  What I really liked most about the story is the mystery in Scott's past.  It was almost as if all these questions kept popping up earlier in the book that I was so desperate to find the answers too.  I asked for more than I could chew when Scott revealed what happened to his brother and father.  Crazyyyyyyy!  Had me scared.  During those scenes I found myself sitting up anxious to know what happened.  Also the \\"cowboy\\" coming after Lisey was a sit-up moment.  Other than that you really just relax reading the book.  Boo'ya Moon was expansive but you really didn't get the feel of it being so.  I have to say that I did like Lisey.  Of course when reading you imagine your character's appearance how you want them to appear but I honestly enjoyed Lisey and all of her sorrow, joy, determination, etc.  I felt like I was satting alongside her the entire time revealing Scott's mystery.  Some things I think were still left unanswered for me.  Sometimes I don't get it until a second reading (took me four days to finish this one) but I wanted to know exactly what \\"long boy\\" was or what it represented.  See I can only take things for what they appear on my first try and I was so caught up in the story I didn't think too much about it.  Next I really wanted to know what was \\"bad-gunky\\" exactly.  Now Scott mentioned later in the book that it was something simple that got to his brother and father.  Like a virus of some sort but I still was left wondering exactly what it was and where did it come from.  It was so frightening to see it come alive in his family that I wanted an explaination from a survivor.  I guess that's left for me to search and figure out.  Anyway, this is a great story.  It has it's moments as it paces along but to get to all the little nasty goodies of Scotts past.  It's worth the read.it's moments as it paces along but to get to all the little nasty goodies of Scotts past.  It's worth the read.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|I am not thrilled.  I received this box set today.  It was wrapped in plastic, but it was missing CD number 4!  It has a plethora of M.J.'s music, and originally I thought it was a bargain...until I found the missing CD.  I plan to return it.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I really like Kelly, loved her cd Breakaway! This new cd, is so depressing. I hope Kelly is allright. I know she wanted to do her own thing and got her way, looks like getting your way isn't always the best thing I guess. Her voice is good, but the songs are sad and negative. After listening I found myself to be depressed. I don't buy a cd to be depressed. Sadly I don't recommend this cd and to be honest I don't even want my daughter to listen to it. Whats with all the hate in Never Again. Just a horrible song. Sorry Kelly, but I bet your next cd will be awesome, please try some uplifting songs! 1 star
B000002Q7Y|5.0|Kansas for all practical purposes disbanded in 1984.  After spending several years in the band Streets, original vocalist / keyboardist Steve Walsh decided to come back to the fold and a new Kansas was born.  Original members Walsh, Guitarist Rich Williams, and drummer Phil Eheart were augmented by bassist Billy Greer and legendary guitarist Steve Morse.  For me \\"Power\\" is one of Kansas most underrated albums.  I have always really liked it, and I think it still holds up well today.  With Kerry Livgren out of the picture Kansas had definitely become Steve Walsh's band and it is reflected in the overall heavier writing style that Walsh had been using in Streets.  Steve Morse absolutely kills on guitar throughout the album and the rest of the band is all in fine form.  Most of the songs are short, but they are all well written, and band does throw in a progressive rock bone with the great little instrumental \\"Musicatto\\".  \\"All I Wanted\\" was the single from the album that actually cracked the top 20 and got a lot of MTV airplay.  Still, the album did not sell all that well and the second single \\"Can't Cry Anymore\\" charted briefly and then dropped out of sight.  Speaking of \\"Cant Cry Anymore\\" this is another one of those songs that came along at a perfect time in my life.  I was going through the breakup of a relationship and could have literally written the lyrics for this one myself.  It is a great power ballad that really shows off Walsh's voice.  Really, I think every song on this album is good and to me this is a must own Kansas disc, and was a great artistic comeback for the band at the time.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|\\"The Departed\\" is garbage. I've seen more plot, and less bloodshed, in PETA slaughterhouse videos.<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\"'s appeal is strictly to those who like watching heads explode on camera and think that if a movie uses every naughty word in the book -- in every line -- that makes it deep and profound. Anyone who swallowed \\"The Departed\\" needs to have his stomach pumped.<br /><br />Good grief. Shakespeare, the Greek tragedies, classics like \\"The Third Man\\" would be lost on these people. As would a truly fine movie from 2006, \\"The Lives of Others\\", beside which \\"The Departed\\" looks, at best, amateurish and adolescent.<br /><br />I want my money back. And I saw this movie for free.<br /><br />I was so bored I started rearranging the groceries in my bag about ten minutes in. I looked at my watch at least half a dozen times. I thought up drinking games you could play every time Jack Nicholson utters the word *&^%.<br /><br />Several characters are shot -- or dropped -- to death on camera. A man's eyes are poked out. One character is reduced to a drug dependent, quivering wreck. I didn't care.<br /><br />I was amazed at how much I didn't care. I thought about why. I examined the desert emptiness of the script, other than for its resplendently brandished naughty words; reflected that the plot was so bankrupt it could be in chapter 11; I noted how absent characterization was, except to mete out how often each character said %$#^, or his posture when exploding a head.<br /><br />I pondered gossip column narratives involving Alec Baldwin and remembered how cute Mark Wahlberg was in that Calvin Klein ad; I wondered if Leo were still dating the model.<br /><br />An hour into the marathon that was this Guantanamo torture, I realized that I had been so pounded into boredom and apathy that the only thing that would have aroused me was if the entire oh-so-manly cast were, suddenly, to don black net hose and stilletoes, and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style.<br /><br />I hoped against hope that Leslie Nielsen would appear and reveal the entire thing to be a very obscure farce whose humor would gel once Nielsen put it all into \\"Airplane\\"-esque perspective.<br /><br />Was Martin Scorcese trying to prove his own manhood by creating a dystopic Disneyland in which every ride is manned by a cop or a mafioso exploding heads and blurting out swear words?<br /><br />Scorcese insults manhood worse than Andrea Dworkin.<br /><br />As for art?

B000009HF2|4.0|Have you ever heard a song that totally transports you back to a significant time in your past? Well, that's what Peter Frampton's \\"Comes Alive\\" album, excuse me, CD does for me.  Back when I was 17 and riding around with my high school buddies, going to somebody's house after the football games for parties.  Hanging out.  The entire collection of songs causes me to have such feelings of nostalgia because it is such a great grouping of songs that Frampton does so well.  Put it on, real loud if you can and sit back and let the music wash over you and see if you can feel 17 again.

B00008DDXC|5.0|All that is keeping Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going through the summer is the thought of returning to school.  Once again, his relatives are treating him poorly.  And now that he knows he's a wizard, Hogwarts is the only place he feels at home.<br /><br />But he almost doesn't make it back.  First an elf appears and warns him to stay away.  Then the entrance to the train platform is sealed to him.<br /><br />Things quickly turn serious once he does show up at Hogwarts.  Harry keeps hearing voices in the walls that no one else can hear.  And then there is the warning written on the wall in blood.  What is the chamber of secrets?  Why can only Harry hear the voices?  Are the students safe?<br /><br />As with the first movie, this one brings Harry's world to life beautifully.  And once again, the movie sticks very closely to the book.  Since I liked this book better then the first one, I like this movie better, too.  The cast from the first movie returns and hits all the right notes with their characters.  Joining the cast this time is Kenneth Branagh as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and he's a riot in the comic relief role.  Unfortunately, this is Richard Harris' last performance as Dumbledore.  I loved his grandfatherly take on the character.<br /><br />Over the course of this movie, Harry faces a family of giant spiders and a giant serpent.  These scenes are a little scary and could frighten small children.  If your kids scare easily, you might want to view the film first.<br /><br />Fans of the books will be delighted with this film.  It perfectly captures the book on which it is based.
B000H0MKGK|3.0|Like all \\"albums\\" it contains a couple of absolute gems IMO (Waiting on the world to change, Gravity) among the other solid, but more mainstream numbers in the genre.  Hence; 3 stars.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Watched this years ago, after Juliet Binoche lost the Emmy to Julia Roberts . i had not heard of the movie til then. Now it had my curiosity.    The story line is so different, it is a combination of a little intrigue, a little eccentric town  and a twist that will surprise you.  Johnny Depp appears in a small role, but is charming.[[ASIN:B00005K3OT Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)]]

B000QFCD2W|4.0|King is currently suffering immense back pain and has had to cancel his tour of Europe, to be rescheduled at a later date.  PLEASE give him your full support and wish for a speedy recovery.  Send King your wishes for him to get better.      King today released this compact disc, whilst at the same time his vertebrae released a herniated disc.       \\"Why that silly wheelchair?\\"    Um, because King's spine is being herniated by Satan.  That bone mic must weigh a TON.  Either that, or his Mini Cooper (the ultimate satanic metal spook-ride) has REALLY unsupportive seats.  I'm hoping the next generation Mini Cooper will offer a special commemorative King Diamond Lumbar Support option...with of course EXTRA HOT seat heaters.  Which can't be turned off.  Only available in flat black goathide.         This album is OK, but gets tedious and boring.  Not Them or Abigail great (they're untouchable) but not as unlistenable as some of his mid-90's output.      HOWEVER...    Let me preface this next section by stating that MOST extreme diehard fans will NOT have enough of an open mind to even give credence to what I'm going to state.  I understand that.  I also understand that quite a lot of people don't have the ability to discern the difference between real and programmed drums, or just don't care.  And, I totally expect a plethora of responses saying inane things from those whom refuse to even TRY to listen for what I'm going to describe.  Suffice it to say...    THESE ARE NOT REAL DRUMS ON \\"GIMME YOUR SOUL\\" REGARDLESS OF WHAT MR. DIAMOND STATES.  FACT.    I'm SO tired of people using programs like \\"Drumkit From Hell\\" and their ilk (and drum machines just a few years ago) to program drums on metal albums. They are INSTANTLY recognizable. And, they suck. Fake.     Other bands that have done this lately...Exodus, Black Label Society, and Megadeth...the list goes on an on.     Don't believe me? Then you don't have the ears to tell the difference.  Or, you refuse to LET yourself hear it.    It's easiest to tell on the King albums, such as \\"The Puppet Master\\" and \\"Abigail II.\\" King forgot to turn off the fake tambourine click track that goes along with EVERY song (he forgot to turn it off on several parts of the new album as well). Combine this with the by the book drum beat and cymbal hits (cymbal hits which have NO variation in amplitude, pitch, modulation, or sound variance AT ALL) and this is a no-brainer. And, it's not the fact that it may be triggered.  These drums have NOT been \\"played\\" by a human.  No drummer does such insane footwork combined with the most simple laid back hi-hat and snare beats.  Not real. Not played.     Listen to the hi-hats on any more recent albums by King and these bands listed above...every hit sounds exactly the same. For example, it's funny on the Black Label songs...where the hi-hat is programmed to \\"close,\\" they mistakenly forgot to omit the actual \\"open\\" hi-hat sound sample after the \\"closed\\" hi-hat sound is triggered. If this were a real hi-hat, the \\"open\\" sound would STOP completely when the hi-hat was \\"closed.\\" This doesn't happen. This is impossible on real drums. The recent King albums exhibit this, but much to much less extent.  King, or whomever programs his drums, is better at it than a lot of others.      I digress...don't try to go the \\"OK, they may be samples but they are actually played and triggered\\" LAME cop-out argument.  If they WERE actually played, they would SOUND played, regardless of triggers...it's the WAY they are programmed that gives it away. They are always programmed in such a way that (for example) the cymbal hits give it away...no drummer EVER plays the way they are programmed on the albums.  The drums are programmed in the most basic way possible. It's a ridiculous conundrum...the bass drums are programmed usually with super fast super heavy double bass classic metal beats and fills, but the hi-hats, snare, cymbals, and ride are programmed to do the most simple, trite, straight elementary beats that only a non-drummer would program (similar to a straight beat on a drum machine for guitar players to solo over).  Listen to an album with verifiable REAL drums (old King albums for example, Slayer, Rush, Tommy Aldridge...hell, ANYTHING before programming began) and you will INSTANTLY hear what I'm talking about.  There's nuance.  There's a slightly different tone in EVERY cymbal, snare, ride, and hi-hat hit.  And, the snare rolls DON'T DOUBLE UP (cough, cough, cough...) on fast fills.      A great example again is how the cymbals are programmed, where cymbals hit ALWAYS at the same time at the end of a measure (what drummer ONLY hits cymbals the SAME way in EVERY song at the END of EVERY measure?), snare rolls are totally mechanical with no feeling, and some fills are just SO basic that you think, \\"Wait, no GOOD drummer would EVER just do that.\\" On this album, when the little super fast double bass comes in at the end of one of the songs, the handwork going on at the SAME TIME sounds like Ringo Starr with his hands taped together; it's THAT basic.  What drummer have you EVER heard go absolute balls-out NUTS with his feet would do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING with his hands at the same time???!?!!?  It's appalling...nothing short of hip-hop could sound any more fake.     The SOUND of the digital samples is decent...but they need to be programmed by a drummer who has a clue of HOW a real drummer plays in a metal context...simply programming complicated bass drum beats whilst leaving everything else programmed to sound LIKE A DRUM MACHINE of the 80's does NOT cut it.  And again, that fake tamborine click track!!!!     These bands will NEVER admit to using drum programmers/machines. King still denies it (he even still tries to state the horrendous \\"drums\\" on \\"The Eye\\" were actually played on an electronic kit which is total BS...those drum sounds were programmed on a primitive digital machine). The last several King albums have had programmed drums, and while 1000% better than the \\"Eye\\" drums, they still sound 100% fake...and King wonders why everyone lusts for the days of Mikkey Dee's REAL drum fills. People CAN tell the difference...if they just think and LISTEN for themselves and not believe everything they are told and spoon-fed as fact.  There's a reason people want Mikkey Dee back, and it's NOT only because of his unique playing ability...it's because he plays like a HUMAN, not a program. Most won't let themselves hear it or realize it, but all you have to do is listen closely...again, NO drummer actually plays like the programmed drums on these recent albums. But, it's more cost effective to program in these trying times for artists.  However, we're on to you King...just admit these are programmed drums. These are NOT actually played. Simple to tell.  Bands and artists such as King \\"credit\\" a drummer simply because they don't want to lose \\"metal cred\\" by admitting to using cost-cutting programmed drums. King would NEVER admit it...and it's at least common knowledge nowadays regarding \\"The Eye\\" (even though some idiots still refuse to believe it). Again, King has many complaining about the absence of Mikkey Dee...but, ANY drummer actually PLAYING DRUMS on ANY of his last several releases would quelch some of these complaints. The difference between Dee and King's current programmed drums is simply enhanced 1000-fold by the fact that not only are the drum \\"lines\\" not imaginative (regardless of the complexity of the bass drum programmed lines and runs), but they're not even played by a human and thusly lack that elusive intimate feel...they don't grab you. People actually PLAYING is what music should be. This is a bad trend.     It is MUCH cheaper to program the drums for an \\"artist.\\" However, REAL drums can have just as much feel as a good soulful guitar solo. A good analogy would be...what if the guitar solos were replaced by midi file programmed guitar solos that emulated amplified guitar sounds? No feeling would result...and it's the same with all these bands using these cheezy programmed drums inserted via ProTools.  There's no FEELING or EMOTION in these programmed drums.  Drums are MORE than just a beat to play guitar and bass over.  (And no, I'm not a drummer.)     I yearn for the good old days when even if a band, album or a drummer sucked (i.e., someone like Randy Castillo, RIP), at least it was a REAL human with a REAL style (albeit a bad one) that you could IDENTIFY.     The new ProTools recording style and fake programmed drums RUIN music. NO soul whatsoever. \\"Gimme Your Soul, Please\\"?????  Yes, King, PLEASE give us some SOUL in the DRUMMING of your albums, NOT the PROGRAMMING.    How can hardly anyone else NOT be bothered by this?  Open your ears. You'll be surprised by what you realize you are (and aren't) hearing.    Yet I digress, and yes indeed, it's more cost effective to program, and King needs the money for some Doan's Pills...    Get well, King!      I bet he has one HELL of a HEATING PAD.
0679735259|5.0|Michael Herr changed the face of journalism forever.  The poetic imagery, extremely well done, makes reading about history a completely different thing.  When I read the book for the first time, I was completely hooked by the second sentence.  People not framiliar with military lingo may come up upon some confusion.  There are many abbreviations and terms that Herr expects the reader to understand.  Don't let that stop you, you'll learn them soon enough.  If I had my say, I'd make every American read this book before graduating high school.  After all, people are only people, but history always repeats itself.

B00008DDXL|5.0|[[ASIN:0439064864 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2)]] is probably MY favorite book in the series (besides [[ASIN:0439136350 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3)]] because, in my opinion, they are both equally fantastic).  However, I have to admit that this movie is an amazing interpretation of the book.  Usually, I dislike the idea of books being brought on to the big screen because most of the time, the book gets ruined with a horrible interpretation.  Well, it's not so with this book/movie!  Every single deatail from the Dursleys to Dobby to Gilderoy Lockhart to  The Flying Car to Moaning Myrtle to Tom Riddle's Diary to Aragog to The Basilik are completly amazing and just how I pictured them when I read the book.  I have to say that watching this film will get you the same as reading the book because every page from J.K. Rowling's great work is portrayed incredibly without a single detailed spared (almost)!  [[ASIN:0439064864 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2)]] is one of the best books I ever read, and this movie is one of the best that I've ever seen!  It gets you hooked instatly.  I highly recommend buying this, whether or not you've read the book.  This is GREAT for mystery lovers. ***Oh, yeah!  The plot: Harry Potter is a young wizard who goes to a school called Hogwarts that helps him develop his magical abilities.  During his second year there, someone has opened The Chamber Of Secrets, and has released a great evil that is turning the students to stone!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|That Snakes and Arrows is a popular album, there is no doubt. The amazon sales rankings and the sheer number of the reviews will attest to that. Its release has been long-anticipated and I would say that for the most part, Rush has not disappointed its legion of fans.  I make no claim to being an expert on the band's music and have been only a sometimes fan for the last 30 years mainly because I have found Geddy Lee's voice often hard to take. Many people I know have the same opinion of Lee's vocal skills. But I say to those who have shared that view that Lee has never sounded better than he does here.  Snakes and Arrows represents a return to the kind of powerhouse rock that made Rush famous in the first place. It is just packed with over an hour of mostly very good and memorable songs. Neil Peart's songwriting here gives the album a lyrical heft that ranks it with Rush's best.  While I like the whole CD, some songs naturally stand out. To me, those are Armor and Sword; the thought-provoking The Larger Bowl; the instrumental The Main Monkey Business; The Way the Wind Blows, with its changing tempos and its lyrics relevant to today's world; Faithless; the driving instrumental Malignant Narcissism; and the inspiring We Hold On.  An earlier reviewer wrote that Snakes and Arrows sounds better with every listen. That's certainly been true for me as well.  If you are an old fan of Rush, chances are you are going to love this CD. If you are a sometime fan like myself, you won't be sorry to own this one for sure. I've had it in my CD changer for several weeks now getting lots of play. The packaging includes a handsome booklet containing lyrics, general information and some artwork pertinent to the lyrics.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One of her very best, a true GEM.  From start to finish this album has it all and will MAKE you a fan, if you're not.<br /><br />I wish I could add more stars.
0345363132|5.0|Though a novel, THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR accurately reflects the times (approx.  1459-1485). The story is sympathetic toward Richard III, but it is less romanticized than some other fiction in this category.    If memory serves (I read the book awhile ago.), it treats the disappearance of the princes as a murder - one committed by the Duke of Buckingham without Richard's knowledge or consent. I think this scenario is unlikely, but the work is fiction, and no one knows what happened for certain.    While the novel centers around Richard, readers also will learn about Edward IV, who reigned during most of the time period covered by the book. You will also learn about the disputes between the Houses of York and Lancaster, as well as the role of the French, and to a lesser extent, the role of Burgundy during the Wars of the Roses.    Penman is an awesome storyteller - strong character development, credible blend of fact and fiction, engrossing writing style.
B000P12LWY|5.0|When I first heard about this new series starting up on showtime I thought okay I may give it a try.  After I went to showtime's website I saw episode 1 and 2 online and was hooked. Since I didn't have showtime I had to borrow episode recordings from friends or find it online to watch.  I loved every episode and I plan to buy it when it comes to dvd.  With the way this series is named they could potentially draw it all the way out to Elizabeth since she is the last of Henry's kids to rule over England.  I do wish that they had really introduced Margaret and Mary which were Henry's sisters instead of putting them together.  Margaret could have had a small role since her actual descent takes over the English throne after Elizabeth.
0143038419|5.0|This book was funny, sad, inspirational and all together a beautiful journey of a person finding herself through  food, prayer and love.  This book inspires in so many ways, I find myself choosing to be happy, content and thankful.  You may never find yourself in a position to eat your way through Italy, sit in the palm of God in India or explore your full sexuality in Bali, but you can go on this wonderful journey by reading this fabulously honest and well written book.  What a great summer read, I loved it!!!
0385340559|2.0|I look forward to each and every Lee Child book; however, the latest was a big disappointment.  The beginning was  pretty good, followed by an extremely SLOW paced, long, drawn out middle, only to be redeemed by a good ending.  Perhaps Child is rushing his novels to capitalize on his popularity.  This is the only reason I can think of for the downward spiral.  I look forward to his next novel; I will give him one more chance!
0529064847|5.0|I have been exploring the Catholic religion recently. I ordered this Bible after finding out that there were additional books in the Catholic version of the Old Testament. I was curious. Now that I have read a lot of the additional books and a great many of the introductions to the other books of this Bible - I can honestly say that this is the most interesting, understandable, and enlightening Bible I have ever read.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I had never really been that interested in Rihanna that much when she came out. I had heard about her a lot though. Last April, I bought \\"A Girl Like Me\\" and the songbook for it also. I loved the singles (S.O.S., Unfaithful, Break It Off, and We Ride) but the rest of the album didn't do much for me. Noticing the album's chart peformance, I thought Rihanna might never change and just be forgotten about it like another reviewer said. When \\"Umbrella\\" came out, I expected more banging singles but one of her usual ballad-heavy albums. I was also shocked to see another album by her so quick. So I bought \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" and was shocked. She changed so much and has created one of my favorite albums. Seriously, this is the kind of music she shines on. Anyway, here's a track-by-track review.    Umbrella-This song, right now, is spending its fourth week at number one on the Billboard charts. It's incredible and catchy. The beat is great and this is the type of song that is just plain solid.    Push Up On Me-This and Umbrella are my favorite songs on the album. It's great and it reminds me of an 80's club song which is my favorite type of music. Rihanna really feels this song too with her lines, (\\"we break, we break, we break it down\\")    Don't Stop The Music-This song is also up-beat and is also great. Maybe not a favorite of mine, but the great music doesn't stop on this track.    Breakin' Dishes-I've heard rumors about this song being the third single. It's very possible because this song is solid. The beat is infectious and the bass line adds a lot to this strong song.    Shut Up And Drive-This song samples \\"Blue Monday\\" by New Order. I had to listen to \\"Blue Monday\\" a few times to finally realize what was being sampled, lol. Anyway, this puts a great up-beat rock twist on an 80's song.    Hate That I Love You-Rihanna and Ne-Yo team up to make a great mid-tempo. The guitar part is nice, but a bit repetitive. This song is not a favorite of mine, but it has grown on me and may grow more. It's very catchy as well as some other songs on this album.    Say It-This is where this album hits a more common type of R&B. It almost reminds of me of a Mariah Carey song with a trip-hop twist. It's okay and it has also grown on me but this is also not a favorite of mine.    Sell Me Candy-Now here's another one of my favorites. It's short and to the point but everything you need for a good song is in there. The bridge and chorus are just so infectious. It's a great reggae up-tempo track.    Lemme Get That-Of all the songs here that have grown on me, this has grown on me the most and I'm sure it will on you too. I thought this song was pretty pointless at first. However, I've found it to be pretty catchy and I especially like the ending.    Rehab-I see this song as possibly the fourth single. It's perfect for the radio and it's a great ballad. Her voice has matured greatly and we can now hear more songs like this from her. The chorus is repetitive but that's not totally a bad thing here.    Question Existing-I see a lot of bad things written about this song. I actually like this song and find her honesty to be very revealing about herself. The powerful lyrics say that entertaining is something she does for a living, not who she is.    Good Girl Gone Bad-This is a pretty good song to end the album with. It sounds like a country song a lot. The ending lyrics also give you something to think about so it's a great song!    Overall, this album NEEDS to be in your collection. Even if you haven't been a Rihanna fan, this is totally different from her previous material. So please, buy this CD and welcome Rihanna into the world of divas.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I think that it was really good and i recommend to buy it! I stayed up all night and watched cause i wanted to see what happened next.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I have most of the lp albums. The first two albums, hybrid theory collision course. I even have the fort minor album and mixtape. Their ability to audiolize (yes i made that word up) feelings into sounds is uncanny. And the blend of metal, rock and hip hop filled a gaping void in music. Fear, anger, self loathing, loneliness, dissappointment turned into words and music. Good stuff. In their latest release, they have decided to audiolize the feeling of sleepiness. What a dissappointment. And whoever thinks limiting Mike Shinoda's rap lyrics to two songs is maturation needs to take some viagra and check their pulse. Who cares if you are making valid points regarding this unnecessary and immoral war and corrupt administration if you are singing me to sleep when you do it. (I am going to write my congressman as soon as i wake up!...zzzz). If they wrote 50 songs for this album why not include 2 or 3 more for those who didn't want to see the band \\"mature\\" from hard rockers to james taylor overnight (I swear he's singing background on \\"In Between). I gave the album two stars for \\"Hands Held High\\" which I could listen two about 50 times in a row and for about 4 other songs which are pretty good including What I've Done and Bleed it out and Leave Out All the Rest. Definetly not the worst album of the year but equally definitely not the best. Too bad. I picked this album up on the first day without previewing or checking for reviews. I won't do that for the next album.
B000N6TX22|3.0|I can explain \\"Children Of Men\\" like this. You meet a beautiful girl and she says all the right things, you take her out to dinner and the meal is great and of course she looks very good as well. Midway through the night you go back to your place and then she falls asleep. You never can wake her up and you start to wonder where you are and why you're in this situation. Ultimately you're very unsatisfied with your date.     That is how I felt watching \\"Children Of Men\\". It had the right idea and the story was unique. Visually I liked how the movie presented itself and in High Definition it looked spectacular. They painted a bleak and hopeless existence just twenty years in the future. The beginning of the movie was setup nicely, but somewhere along the way the train went off the tracks and it just leaves you sitting there with no place to go. Well, you have an idea of where you should be going, but this film never takes you there.     Clive Owen's performance is hit and miss. For most of the film his is left with a deer-in-headlights look on his face, which is probably really realistic, considering there are bullets whizzing by his head 99% of the time. In retrospect he did what he could with his character, who is basically on the run and has no real given purpose. The highlight is when he knocks the guys off the motorcycle with his car door, that was a cool little part that I enjoyed.     The ending is a complete waste and to me it seems like a cop-out. It's as if the screenwriter and director had no idea where to go next, when they were out of the warzone, so they just leave the movie floating, literally.    Like I said, overall it's got the right idea but it gets lazy and never explains itself. What could have been extraordinary ended up being average.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Every episode has at least one \\"WOW!!!\\" response from us.  In addition, there is always something we learn about our planet that we had no clue existed.  There is no better way to learn about why we must conserve the planet.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|The first song (Umbrella) jumps right at you but from there the cd falls off. There are so many big name producers and artiest involved in this cd that I forgot who was the featured artist. Every track sounds like some one else is trying to make there mark in the music world and that is the problem The cd sounds like every one but, Rihanna. Over all it's a nice up beat cd something to get ready for a night at the clubs.<br /><br />  On the second listen I noticed that working with other artiest and producers actually gave this cd some extra flair and on track 5 you catch a hint of Depech Mode and on track 3 you cant go wrong any time you use stuff from Michael Jackson especially when you can use the words mamma say mamma sah mamma muckusah its always a good thing.
1594489505|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this book for several months. When it came out, I made myself wait for two weeks before I bought it, I was studying for an exam. People around me, and the reviews I read, assured me that this was a fantastic book, \\"literary caviar\\" as one friend put it--all this shunned away any doubts I had about being somewhat comparable to Kite Runner. All that hype, and boy am I disappointed.     The story was too convenient. It painted a very black and white picture. The theme of the story was great, and so is the ending. However, everything in between is somewhat lacking. The characters, the sub-plots, a lot of it is highly predictable. The Buddha statues and marital strife are very predictable.     However, it must be said, that Khaled Hosseini is an excellent auther. His writing is superb.

0793518326|3.0|I was very disappointed with the print size.  Anyone old enough to remember the Beatles will certainly be reaching for their reading glasses.

I thought everything seemed accurate except on \\"...they had to count them all...\\" the chords are listed as C C Aug 7th and the chord chart shows C F.
B00005JPFE|5.0|According to master Parisian chef Gusteau, (Brad Garrett) \\"Anyone can cook!\\" However, not anyone can make a good movie, especially a good movie that happens to be 100% animated. Fortunately, we have Brad Bird (The Incredibles) mixing ingredients that have made for a most appetizing family film.<br /><br />I know, I know -- if you're a childless adult like me, you probably started to zone out when I said \\"family film.\\" But Ratatouille really is a movie for all ages that neither talks down to the kids, nor panders to the adults with snarky double-entendres. It's simply the story of following your dreams, making them real, and what can happen along the way. And if you just happen to be a blue rat, you can relate all the more!<br /><br />Remy (Patton Oswalt) is rodent with a super-sensitive sense of smell ranging from the redolent to the ravishing -- once discovered, the rat pack uses Remy's precious proboscis to sniff out rot and poison, thereby saving many of their lives and allowing them to become bolder... and steps closer the danger-fraught human-habitat, The City of Lights. Remy, a furry would-be gourmet, wants nothing more than to infiltrate the great kitchens of Paris' finest dining establishments to see how the experts ply their considerable talents in creating culinary combinations.<br /><br />The story is split more or less evenly between Remy's story and that of the humans whose lives his little paws touch. His counterpart in the kitchen is young, nerve-wracked cooking-newbie Linguini (Lou Romano), who just happens to (unwittingly) be the long-lost son of Chef Gusteau. Gusteau is recently deceased, but his leaving of the mortal plane doesn't stop him from becoming Remy's mentor, and -- through Remy -- a father to his son.<br /><br />Ratatouille features the voices of some pretty heavy-hitting actors and those with highly recognizable voices (Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm, Janeane Garofalo, Brian Dennehy), but showmanship doesn't drown the main course. Nor are there silly songs, stupid jokes, or pop-culture references. It was obviously made to be a timeless story, and on that level it succeeds.<br /><br />Ratatouille also succeeds on a visual level, using CG animation to tastefully and artfully display everything from fur to fabric to facades. Paris is stunningly recreated via computer, and the rats, while certainly not realistic-looking in the least, do display naturalistic scurries and tail-taps.<br /><br />In short, this rat calls for a toast.pop-culture references.

B00005JPCF|5.0|I knew from the first promo I ever saw for \\"Happy Feet\\" that I HAD to see the film.  It was a joyful, wonderful, touching and sometimes sad film that I saw in a theatre and KNEW I would have to own as soon as it came out on DVD.      The vocal characterizations and music are wonderful.  The humor range is grin-from-ear-to-ear to laugh-out-loud.  In particular, the banter of \\"the amigos,\\" Mumble's small penguin friends is delightful.     The central theme of a child being different from what society expects him to be should hit home with anyone who has ever been different.  Mumble's inability to sing well and his wanting to dance instead causes no end of embarrassment to his father Memphis.  Mumble's predicament has been shared by every kid who was not as athletic/beautiful/gifted etc. as a parent has wished.    I resented the critics who thought the movie got off-track when it got into the question of humans ruining the environment for so many species.  The fact of the matter is that loss of habitat, over-fishing, pollution and extinction are all facts of humanity's impact on the planet.  \\"Happy Feet\\" should be applauded for bringing this message in a way that might inspire even the littlest among us to care for Earth and all Her children.    Ultimately, the film celebrates tolerance, being true to oneself and, hopefully, the ultimate acceptance by society that \\"different\\" is not synonymous with \\"evil.\\"    \\"Happy Feet\\" truly deserved the Oscar for best animated feature of 2006.      Kudos.
B000OPOANE|1.0|The point is that after hearing the whole Record, i can't even remember or sing any voice melody, i think there's no doubt RUSH is a primary column for progressive rock all around the world, so expectations of all fans have to be bigger than for any other prog bands, but i just don't see any evolution in songs, it looks they just haven't had enough time or inspiration to get the best material possible on their last records. It seems that RUSH is not the band that used to be on the 70's or early 80's, RUSH is now just becoming a product sold with a wide demand all around the world by inertia, but for us that opened the Signals album on 1982 is another story, on Snakes and Arrows there's a lot of power, a huge sound performed by maybe the best three musicians in rock music ever but inside empty ideas in comparison with the past compositions. One thing is to hear them just play together and making amazing chops, that's what's happening on this record, another thing is to hear them playing amazing songs like Red Barchetta, The Trees or Tom Sawyer.    With this album i just go back to think there won't be a Moving Pictures ever again on time, so to me RUSH is already an inmortal band, there's nothing else to prove, i wish i could have a new and amazing RUSH album these days, but maybe they're not in the mood now for brilliant ideas surrounded with analog sounds. I'm a drummer as many on earth inspired by Peart's talent but now he simply play drums great but i don't think his  arrangement work on drum parts doesn't sound good when these are played over undefined and confussing harmonies.       And something quite important is finally the answer to which is the place for RUSH among so many good bands playing today?, i just will mention some, think so many others you know: PORCUPINE TREE or OSI (and i hate Mike Portnoy's attitude), just because of these two great bands among others, RUSH has the commitment to be more competitive arranging songs obviously on their own style,because with or without RUSH, progressive rock music is getting to interesting places full of innovative ideas and complex sound alternative environments, but once again, the reason for this is just not to prove anything, it's just to extend a unique legacy for all of us fans because on their long career they still have the chance to do it!!!. I hope there will be another RUSH record in the future that get's back my attention to run and buy it just like it was on the golden progressive rock eighties.
B00006RU5B|5.0|A mix of the bands Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine WORKS for this group. Chris Cornell's career on his own wasn't so hot, but these guys are UNBEATABLE together.<br /><br />I Am The Highway is a favorite, but Show Me How To Live is destined to be (already is on local rock radio) a classic!<br /><br />This album received much hype - and deservedly so.  There IS no weak track on this CD.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is simply amazing! I don't know why critics were setting this album up to fail. They were saying it was so depressing and sounded so dark. Yes, it isn't like Breakaway, but it is about as up-beat rock as you are going to get! It is definitely a girl's rock album! I love it.  I approached this album with an open mind and I am so happy I did. Just keep an open mind and let it ride, because this album is definitely a rollercoaster of fun! Love it!!! \\"Yeah\\", \\"How I Feel\\", \\"One Minute\\" are probably the most upbeat and make you want to sing out loud songs; but all of them are great! \\"Sober\\" really shows her vocal range and really hits a nerve, it actually made the hair on my arm stand up the first time I heard it.  Overall, GREAT ALBUM! GO KELLY!
0743454537|5.0|I'm a writer and am picky about what I consider a GOOD book. This one definitely falls in that category.<br /><br />It's not only an interesting story, but Ms. Picoult tells it with style and flair.<br /><br />Anna, the main character, was conceived to give her cord blood to her ill sister, Kate. However, Anna's \\"donations\\" to her sister did not end with the cord blood.<br /><br />This is a poignant story of the workings of a family of five. They hurt, rebel, take advantage, and ignore. Yet, they also never give up hope, love one another, and endure hardships the average family never experiences.<br /><br />All in all, (especially with the shocker ending), this book was a super read.<br /><br />I'm almost finished with Ms. Picoult's The Tenth Circle, and I've loved it, as well.<br /><br />Keep 'em coming! ;-)
B000OONTFU|3.0|I was very disappointed with The Matrix. While the quality of the video transfer is excellent, the audio is slightly out-of-sync, which makes it difficult to watch at times. This is not an issue with either Reloaded or Revolutions.    I don't understand how something like this could have happened. The flagship movie of the three has got serious audio problems. Very disappointing.    I give the whole set a 3, but for The Matrix it deserves much lower than that. It's too bad too, because if The Matrix were in sync, then I'd give the whole set a much better grade.

1904233023|5.0|I read Ender's Game on a suggestion from a very good friend.  I had read about in Card's book \\"How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy.\\" The description there demanded that one read the book.     I read the book, not wanting to put it down.  I wouldn't have, either, if sleep hadn't been a stronger impulse.  The side plot that included Peter and Valentine was a nice touch.  It showed that all these kids were intelligent and knew how to get what they desired.  The last part with Ender playing the Game completely shocked me.  I was amazed what Ender had actually been doing during the game.  Ender's want of becoming a compassionate kid instead of the killer the others wanted him to be personified the character.    If you haven't read Sci-fi before, this is a good place to start.  It gradually introduces you to the genre, without forcing you into unfeasable prospects.  I would suggest this book to anyone who liked Star Wars or any similar story.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I give it 4 1/2 stars!    So Never Again, Kelly's first single off My December, wasn't a huge sucess. Who Cares?! This album is GREAT! There has been a lot of negative speculation about this album. This album might be bitter, but wasn't Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Walkaway? This album isn't Breakaway, so don't expect it to be; this is a new chapter in Kelly's life with a new sound. Kelly breaksaway from her mainstream bubblegum pop ways, and ROCKS OUT! She really brings it in Can I Have a Kiss and Hole; two songs you DO NOT want to miss! What I really like about Clarkson's new CD is she brought some R&B and techno-ish songs like Yeah, Judas, and Haunted. But for all you Kelly Clarkson 'pop' fans, she still has it in her with songs like One Minute and How I Feel -- two songs that will definitely be on the Billboard top 10. And she really shows us her vocal talent with her ballads Be Still, Sober, and the enchanting Maybe. But the high point in the album is definitely the last song Irvine. This song really shows what Clarkson is capable of, and that is a whole lot.    THE SONGS!  Never Again -- Clarkson's first single. It is catchy, but too negative for radio play, and we all saw that when it flopped. (Don't worry though Clarkson has some big radio play hits still on the album) 7.5/10    One Minute -- Clarkson shows she still dominates the pop world with this hit, and it's sure to be just that - A HIT! 9.5/10    Hole -- It's a dark one! But it is GREAT! I like this song much better than Never Again, and this really shows Clarkson is here to stay as a writer too! This is definitely one of the better songs on the album. 9/10    Sober -- GREAT, GREAT, GREAT! What can I say? This song has got it going on! This is an awesome second single for Kelly. She really brings feeling into this song -- something most artists lack these days, but don't forget to check out live versions of Sober! They are even better! 9.5/10    Don't Waste Your Time -- Personally,I am not really feeling this song. It is not Clarkson's better songs, and I can understand why Clive might have not liked this song, but it is definitely not a filler, and I'm sure some Clarkson fans will love this song because of the catchy melody; its just not for me. 6/10    Judas -- Definitely proves Kelly Clarkson can ROCK! Most female rockers have trouble with keeping up, but Kelly proves she has got it in her, and this song puts her above Evanessence! WAY TO GO KELLY! 9/10    Haunted -- Everytime I listen to this song it gives me chills. This song is haunting, but in a good way! The lyrics are a little bitter and sad, but what is wrong with that when she sings like she does in this song! 8.5/10    Be Still -- An enchantingly raw ballad from Kelly! This is the voice that puts her in the category with Celine, Mariah, and Whitney! WOW! 8.75/10    Maybe -- It is one of the best from Kelly Clarkson so far! I think this song is really where Kelly is comfortable in, and needs to stay. This type of song really shows Clarkson is one of the best out there, and why she deserves a grammy! 10/10    How I Feel -- A HIT FOR SURE! This will definitely be a radio play winner. With the catchy beat and popish feel, this song will bring Kelly back to where she belongs, and a big smack in the face to Clive for saying he didn't hear any hits! 9.5/10    Yeah -- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH! Way to go Kelly! She shows her R&B style in this one! It's a sexy song that is a little different, but shows Kelly can do all different styles. I love it! 9/10    Can I Have A Kiss -- A track you CANNOT miss! I would pay $15 for just this track! This is clarkson's best rock/pop track on the album! I can definitely hear a future top 10 single in this song! 9.75/10    Irvine -- CLARKSON AT HER BEST! This album ends with the amazing, amazing track Irvine from Kelly! WOW! She proves herself yet again! It is a great ending track, she proves that she is the best in the buisness! WAY TO GO! 11/10!!!    Chivas (Hidden Track) -- It comes at about 5 minutes into Irvine, and has a garage band sound to it that is really different from anything else. This song is the most unmainstream Kelly gets, but it proves she will be here a long time! Great writing skills too! 8.5/10    Overall this is a CD that really proves Kelly is here to stay. It is a take that to Clive cause Clarkson wins the battle! This CD is a hit maker! She's an amazing singer -- we all knew that -- but in this album she proves she's an amazing writer too! WAY TO GO!

It takes time to become conscious and The Secret is a mass media way to show a large audience what consciousness or the Law of Attraction is and makes it palatable.

0312323867|5.0|After reading SOMETHING BORROWED, I was anxious to read SOMETHING BLUE.  I was disappointed to discover that the story is told in Darcy's perspective.  She is materialistic and self-centered, someone that most of us would stay away fron in real life.  However, I quickly got over my disappointment because I was immediately engaged.  Darcy put herself in a whole series of unsympathetic situations throughout both books, but in the end the reader ends up feeling satisfied and even  happy for her as she grapples with the true meaning of love and friendship and begins to understand.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I think the media is paying too much attention to the \\"Clive\\" story and to each other's commentary.  There are lots of radio friendly tracks on this CD.  What does radio friendly mean, anyway? Almost all the pop songs out right now contain bleeps or moments of dead air because radio can't play those words or phrases on the air, but they are still considered radio friendly? Many contain violent, overdone sexual, or just boring themes, but they are still considered radio friendly. So how on earth does sad and angry - something everyone on the planet can relate to -equate to not radio friendly? At least I don't have to make sure I bought the \\"walmart\\" version before playing the CD in the car with my 10 year old (who loves Never Again).     And what do some of these critics mean when they say there are no \\"hooks\\"? Of course there are hooks, obvious ones. Kelly did a fantastic job. My favorites are Never Again, Hole, Judas, Can I Have a Kiss, Irvine/Chivas, and of course, Sober.  All the other songs are good, too, but I can't list them all as my favorites.  All of  Kelly's fans will love this album and I think she will gain a lot of new fans. The haters will still hate because that's what they do best.

It is delivered with great intellectual passion which translates into a very readable analysis of 'mankind'. I have worked in development and developing countries for over 10 years and this book answers so many of the questions regarding the hierachy of power and knowledge. It answers many of the questions that I have asked regarding how we have the conflcits and social unrest that we are experiencing today. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to understand the human condition from an historical and sociological perspective. It gives legitimacy to idea of community rather than that of the individual which appears to have dominated out collective thinking of late.
B0001I55NS|4.0|I enjoyed the action and romance in the story and especially liked the character of Merek.  If you like action and romance and a lot of sword-play and flaming arrows...enjoy!!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've got the last two American series recordings that Johnny Cash did and this one is way better than his last. I love them both, but if you have neither, get this one first. His cover of \\"Hurt\\" is outstanding. You can see the video on YouTube of both his cover and the original by Nine Inch Nails. It's amazing just how much better he does this song, its as if it was written just for him.<br /><br />Note: I am not generally a Country Western fan, and yet this series hits a strong note in me.
1400049628|5.0|one of the funniest books I have ever read, so convincing you start to think that brooks is out of his mind.
B000GY729M|4.0|Sure some of Sam's Town is a lot closer to two stars than five stars (think the pointless brace of enterlude and exitlude, or Uncle Jonny, the inevitable nod to every rock band's friend or relative with a voracious appetite for drugs, or the painfully banal Why Do I Keep Counting), but like former Giants/Cubs/Mets slugger Dave Kingman, when The Killers aren't striking out, they are hitting some mammoth and memorable shots.  I was driving as Read My Mind spun up when I first played the CD.  I had to pull off the road to avoid being a danger to myself and others.  Nothing has changed in the hundred or so listens since then -- it is as thrilling a four minute compendium of longing and bravado as anything I've heard in a long time.  (And, for me, it doesn't hurt a bit that its two bridges -- \\"the good old days; the honest man...\\" etc. -- recall David Garza's wonderful Crown of Thorns on his Overdub CD.)  Nothing on the rest of the CD quite reaches that same high point and even the best songs of the second half, e.g. Bones and This River is Wild, come off like reworkings of the strongest material on earlier cuts, e.g. Sam's Town and When You Were Young.    But here's the thing -- The Killers are not afraid to stretch themselves.  No playing safe here.  They do bombast fit for an arena, they do humor, they do tender, and, with this bittersweet Valentine to their home town, they tell a pretty good story.  Some of it doesn't work so well; a lot of it does.  My personal guess is that as they mature there will be more and more successful blendings of those disparate elements.  As they say about NFL draft picks, there's a lot of up side in this band.  They just have to keep producing more \\"It's funny how you just break down/Waitin' on some sign/I pull up to the front of your driveway/With magic soakin' my spine\\" and less \\"am I strong enough/to be the one/will I live to have some children.\\"
1582701709|1.0|This book is attractively packaged. However 'the secret' is what we have always known as humans. Every thing comes to those who work for it truly and honestly. A very clever marketing campaign has made a lot of money for the author and that is about all.
0060557818|5.0|I read hundreds of novels annually on average, and NEVERWHERE is simply one of the most entertaining novels I've read this year.  It's been a while since I've had this much fun with a book.  I really didn't want it to end.<br /><br />NEVERWHERE, which is a dark fantasy that takes place in London's underground, has everything: action, humor, and great characters.  Gaiman does a great job of bringing this fantasy world to life and making it believable.  Even if you don't normally enjoy this kind of book, I think you will find this novel a pleasure to read.<br /><br />This book has turned me into a Gaiman fan and I plan on reading the rest of his work to see if he has written anything that equals this.
B000O176Q6|5.0|What an awesome movie!  Even after all these years.  Especially now in Blu-Ray.
0061139378|5.0|I can't add much more to the reviews already posted.  I really enjoyed this novella from Gaiman, one of the best fantasists working today.<br /><br />CORALINE is a lovely children's story with the same surreal whimsy that Lewis Carroll presented in ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  The story about a young girl's magical adventures is as wonderfully written tale that authentically captures the magic of childhood.  This story has some dark and gruesome moments, but is fine for older children.  It is also quite suitable for adult readers.<br /><br />I enjoy Gaiman, and suggest this book and NEVERWHERE as the best introductions to his work (in addition to his short stories).
B00001U0E1|5.0|It has a great pace and a great turn of phrase.  If you have any theater experience at all you will be in on the jokes.  It makes one appreciate good acting from great acting. Their perfomances pull you in even when they are acting at acting.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Buy this CD and you'll never regret it.  A wonderful mix from the best live band on the planet.  These three gifted musicians only get better with age.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I would give this 5 stars if they had only included (even at a slightly higher price) the extras on the regular DVD version.    How come I must pay more for the High def version and then be penalized by getting less content?  And I am really interested in that content too - it sounds very interesting and relevant to our future.    Expecially if that additional content was also high def, but even regular definition inclusion would make me feel like my business and willingness to support a brand-new technology is appreciated (its risky - what if it doesn't catch on?).
B000GFLAI0|5.0|\\"Modern times\\" is Bob Dylan's 44th album, his first US #1 in some 30 years, and winner of 2 Grammys. It had all the major (and minor) critics practically falling over themselves to come up with the most gushing reviews on release.<br /><br />It's also the first Bob Dylan album I've owned. All the above listed achievements piqued my interest and so I took the plunge and got it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not new to his music (I love \\"Like a rolling stone\\", \\"Forever young\\" and \\"Blowin' in the wind\\" to mention a few).<br /><br />At just 10 tracks (though clocking past an hour) flowing through folk/country/blues/rock, with superior musicianship and storytelling lyrics (though sometimes cryptic and laden with old testament Biblical imagery -\\"if I catch my enemies sleeping/I'll just slaughter `em where they lie\\" from \\"Ain't talkin'\\", \\"Spirit on the water/darkness on the face of the deep\\" from \\"Spirit on the water\\"), superb stuff!<br /><br />Opening is \\"Thunder on the mountain\\" which does just that. A great rock and roll number with lyrics that manage to fit Alicia Keys in the picture. Other uptempo tracks are the rocking blues of \\"Rollin' and tumblin'\\", the blues of \\"Someday baby\\" (winner of best solo rock vocal performance Grammy), and \\"The levees gonna break\\" (great bassline).<br /><br />My favourites though are the slower stuff; the tender \\"Spirit on the water\\", the retro and reflective \\"When the deal goes down\\", \\"Working man's blues #2\\" (simply stunning and one of my favourites), the more country styled \\"Beyond the horizon\\", \\"Nettie Moore\\", and the 8 plus minute closing cut \\"Ain't talkin'\\", my other favourite.<br /><br />His heartfelt raspy, nasal vocal style is one you either love or loathe, but it fits each song like a glove.<br /><br />Listening to Dylan, I can see where loads of other acts derive their muse: Eric Clapton, Chris Rea, Dire Straits, even Springsteen to mention a few. Well, he's got a new fan in me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I sat spellbound watching this extraordinary video set.  The images are stunning and contain footage I have never before witnessed. David Attenborough's narration is thorough and full of passion (you can tell he really knows his stuff).  The behind-the-scene featurettes are amazing (I can't believe the patience and dedication of the film crews).  This series is a must for anyone who has ever watched a nature film/documentary and thought...wow.  This one is the ultimate WOW!!
067003830X|5.0|This a fantastic book and an excellent read. I recommend it for anyone who is a therapist or physician as well as all of those who require our services.
B000002MY3|5.0|I did not have any problems with my order.  It was delivered within reasonable time and in excellent condition! This has always been my favorite album.  Thanks!
B000E1155E|5.0|This is an excellent catchy CD that rock and rolls pretty well.  My favorite tracks are \\"Red light indicates doors are secure\\" and \\"marty bum\\"  Also check out \\"The Redwalls\\" first CD \\"Universal Blues\\" if you liked this CD.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This movie offers a world that the viewer can get lost in and mesmerized by.  As a fan of Neil Gaiman's comic books, this movie was exactly what I would expect from him.
B000P2A256|4.0|Too many times groups have spectular 1st cd's and the highly anticipated 2nd cd is a big let-down. Maroon 5 have broken the curse. If you liked \\"Jane\\" then go ahead and plunk your dollars down for this one. It's great and will spend lots of time playing over and over again in your car...Here's hoping that No.3 will also be as fresh and inventive.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|This is the newest CD by Linkin Park, and I have to say, this is very NOT Linkin Park.  Linkin Park was and is known for their unique hybrid sound of blending rock and rap beats into one sound.  This album is very rock like.  Linkin Park seems to have focused more on harder guitar rifts that bring back such memoriable songs as \\"One Step Closer\\" from their first album.  Also, in the past, lead vocalists Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda have split time on the tracks.  On Minutes to Midnight, Mike Shinoda is all but absent, save for maybe 4 songs.  Not that Chester is bad, his range is very well shown on the album.  From raspy rock screaming, to soft highschool prom-like ballads, Chester really shows his true talent.  Another point, there is NO solo from Mr. Hahn! Thats too bad, because Mr. Hahn shows his talents as a master of the mix tables on the past albums.  Also, Mike Shinoda had to do one track taking a stab at political agendas.  I usually have a tendancy to frown upon this, like when Green Day makes a whole album like that;  Or bands like System of a Down doing the same, but here, Linkin Park looks to gather mass appeal.  This is also shown from the hard rock rifts, soft ballads, to cleverly worded flows----few as they may be.  If you really were hoping for another ingenious hybrid album from Linkin Park, this is not it.  If you enjoy the ever changing sound of music and how bands attempt to go with it, this is it.  No Mr. Hahn, Mike Shi-nowhere, and a politcal stab song; Minutes to Midnight gets three * * * out of five.
1594489505|5.0|The book started kinda slowly and then the middle kinda sagged but the last third of the book was awesome!  I couldn't put it down.  This is one of the most surprising novels I've read in a while.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This movie truly is an eye opener.  Even though it is very hard to watch because of all of the killing, it is still a must see movie.  Well written and well acted.  I'm not a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but this movie made me think twice.  Djimon Hansu is phenomenal.  This movie shows the brutality of greed and power.  Highly recommended.
0783116934|4.0|I rented this a little while back and was amazed by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Max Von Sydow and Jeffrey DeMunn's performances. I was floored that this was released by HBO in 1995 and I had never seen it before. The title made me wonder if this was a movie like Citizen Kane. No, this is not the same kind of story at all. This movie follows the killings of the most heinous serial killer of all time. In the U.S.S.R during communism a serial killer managed to pick up strangers on the expansive train system and take them to secluded spots and murder them. They killed 52 people. This movie follows the investigation by the police to try and catch them. An incredible job of acting by Rea as the forensics expert put in charge of the case. Amazing job of showing the political underpinings that impact the case. Despite incredible efforts and even his apprehension at one time, the killer eludes them for many more years. The story is remarkable, the cast is exceptional, and the production is top drawer. I highly recommend this movie. If I have any complaint, it is the movie left me with some unanswered questions. I still immediately ordered the DVD after renting it.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Who doesn't love this version? I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, but this is a Christmas must-see for our family every year.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|While this version of the movie is truer to the novel than the PBS version, some of the Redford/Farrow scenes are hard to watch. My students like the newer version better because the acting is more credible and Mira Sorvino is a \\"hot\\" Daisy, but this is closer to the book. We need a third version of this movie with me as director.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I popped this CD in on the way to Vegas from Los Angeles in the middle of the night. Johnny's haunting voice came booming through the speakers like a soundtrack to the desert. Full of stories and vivid descriptions this CD cant be described as anything less than epic. Moving along like a Steam Train up hill the music gains momentum and impresses more with each bar sung. If youre looking for a little dark night, outlaw country Johnny Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around is just what you need.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore makes great presentations on environment. I bought this one even before it got the Oscar thinking it would be a great documentary movie in my collection. And it turned out is.    This documentary is not a boring presentation at all but a well formed movie or story.    Thumbs up to the movie, hats off to Gore.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I am not a fan of little movies that have a weak plot and clobber you over the head with a message, which I assumed this movie would be. However, I am a fan of Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah. The strange thing is (no pun intended), while they are both as good as ever, the actor who is stunning is Will Ferrell. He pulls you in almost immediately and you follow along because you care about him (and 'watch', lest we forget). I don't think this movie would work at all without him or that anyone else I can think of could have played Harold. (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE.) That said, I also have to disagree with the reviewers who have had a problem with the ending. The ending is exactly right because everyone's priorities finally get straightened out and because the ending fits with the point of the story. The ending is the message. I loved it, watched it immediately a second time to notice things I'd missed the first time and will buy a copy to keep.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I have all Enya's albums but this one is simply not as good as any of her previous ones.
0385340559|4.0|One of the better Reacher stories.  It was good to read a story chockful of action and stocked with his old friends from military service.  As usual, this one makes very fast reading -- with the expected and hoped for Reacher heroics.  As an avid reader who's been stuck to a desk all his working life, I really like to project myself into this life of a vagabond good guy.
B000OPO6VU|5.0|TRILOGY is another great ELP CD. Shout! has proven that it can do ELP the same justice that it did the Marshall Tucker Band, with this CD being just another example of how a great remastering job can overcome the limitations of the original source. Even the Rhino remaster didn't do right by this album, but Shout! finally did.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I saw it on TV and had to buy the DVD  somewhat modernized, romantic tale  probably the sexiest Rochester ever
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Thank you, Madonna, for actually allowing the UNEDITED version of this great concert to make it to DVD...along with an excellent CD for jamming to in the car!  I attempted to watch the NBC special and it was so cut up, it gave me a headache!  I had went last July to Philadelphia to see this concert live...so it was great to see it on TV....but the editing was so horrible...I just had to turn the channel.  The DVD, however, is a bit better, and it is great to be able to relive the concert over again from the comforts of my living room.  All of the songs are great....and of course my favorites \\"Jump\\" and \\"Sorry\\" were the best (to me).  I especially loved hearing the Pet Shop Boys (another one of my favorite groups) on \\"Sorry\\"...and that cool remix!  I hope Madonna's next album is as good, or not better, than Confessions.  There's no one better on the dancefloor than Madonna!
B000683VI4|5.0|I rented this and decided it was one I could enjoy again and again  I figured the story right away which was good as it made it more enjoyable
B000OYC3J8|4.0|As a relatively new fan of the White Stripes (after downloading \\"Icky Thump--The Single\\" from iTunes), I was quite surprised with this album.  The Led Zeppelin influence really comes through with this record, and at times, Jack White sounds almost like the late '60s version of Robert Plant.  Amazing.  The best tracks of this record have to be the title song, \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\", \\"Conquest\\", and \\"Little Cream Soda\\".  Actually, all of the album is great...and \\"Effect and Cause\\" is a great closer.  This one comes highly recommended.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is a great showing of Kelly's growth as an artist! I love how it is not a repeat of \\"Breakaway.\\" Through the lyrics and Kelly's amazing voice, you can really tell how personal this is for her. I'd recommend this album to anyone who enjoys meaningful music over half of the manufactured stuff that's out there. \\"Sober\\" is the album's best song! Incredible job Kelly!!!!
0060763280|4.0|Seldom do books combine down to earth practical advice with a 'reach for the stars\\" mentality. Harv Eker manages to pull this off and keep you entertained at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and use many of the techniques on a regular basis. From saving money and learning to think about money in a new way, to rethinking your own mental make up and your self-worth, this book has many great points.<br />I recommend it very highly. It literally turned my life and my thoughts around.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Just in case someone reading this is new to Dylan, I thought I'd offer some pretty conventional but hopefully useful advice.  Start out with the three Dylan albums listed below, all readily and inexpensively available.  If these get you hooked, start exploring the others.  If not, might I suggest the collections Elvis #1 or the Beatles #1.  If none of those do it for you, try Mozart.  If Wolfgang leaves you cold too, may God help you.      Anyway, here are those three Dylan albums:  Blood on the Tracks  Blonde on Blonde  Highway 61 Revisited.    Have fun.
B000BCE918|5.0|Jurassic Park is a great movie, no doubt about it. And this package is also great... It's very well made, and opens up revealing beautiful images.  The second movie (The Lost World) is boring and it doesn't get near the first.  Jurassic Park III is another great one... It isn't better than the first, but  it's way better than the second.  And the many extras that comes within the discs are good too.    I think that the only fault of this box set is the lack of english subtitles. There's english closed captions only.
B000OONTFU|4.0|This movie on HD-DVD is outstanding.   It's really like seeing it for the first time all over again compared to standard definition.  But not just for the incredible picture detail, but equally important is the major improvement in the sound.       I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for the current standard in HD-DVD PQ, SQ and it is a good movie also.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Being a Rush fan for 25+ years, this Rush album is no different than the others.  I remember when Power Windows came out, and thinking how much I disliked it on the first two listens, put it down, put it back on liked it a little more, put it back down, picked it up and so on.  Then I understood it and loved it.  All Rush albums require this break-in period.  S&A was the same for me.  As of today \\"Presto\\" is my favorite album, so I did a little benchmarking against it.  In a way, I feel like Presto was their last great Masterpiece, was just not well received by fans and they just stopped putting as much thought and effort into songs since then...but I digress.    I love Malignant Narcissism, Hope, and The way the wind blows.  Great songs.  They will be sweet live.  The album just sounds mixed really well.  I know very little about drums, but to me, I like the return of more complexity in the drum fills (something that went away after Presto when Neil claimed to have relearned how to play drums the \\"right\\" way - his words not mine).  The bass work is great as usual, and the guitar is crisp and pleasant to listen to.  Vapor Trails was a little to overpowering and harsh.  Presto a little more \\"muffled\\".    Why not 5 stars?  A lot of little non-Rush type of things go on in this album.  The \\"Woaoh-o-oh-os\\" really bug me on The Larger Bowl, I think it really takes away from the rest of song.  Why not fill the time with some sweet drum/guitar work?  Also, the lyrics on the larger bowl seem strange in the beginning.  The Main Monkey Business is ok at first, then sort of drags along.  I wish they would let some of the songs develop a little before the Lyrics start...they sometimes seem a little forced.  Take a listen to \\"Show Don't Tell\\", \\"the Pass\\" or \\"Available Light\\"...all have great openings before the lyrics start.  The songs on S&A are great, but having a tad more music on the front end of the songs would have made them more musical and less rushed.    But all-in-all,a fine piece of work!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Her best CD yet.  Sober is by far my favourite.  Her vocals are just amazing.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The title is Americanized cockney for \\"What the hell?\\" Coincidentally, that's the conclusion I came to when listening to certain parts of this album, namely when the group adds a Mariachi band (\\"Conquest\\", \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\"), or when they use friggin' bagpipes (\\"St. Andrew (The Battle is in the Air)\\"), or when they rely on cacophonous rock (\\"Little Cream Soda\\"; \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\"), or when they pull a skit about rag-and-bone dealers in the middle of a song (\\"Rag and Bone\\"). Don't go away just yet, though! It's not like the Stripes are losing it or anything. In fact, the blues-rockers here are easily the best: the Led Zeppelin-like \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\\"; slide-guitar driven \\"Catch Hell Blues\\", my favorite White Stripes song ever; the pounding title track; gentle \\"I'm a Martyr for My Love for You\\"; \\"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\\", \\"Bone Broke\\" and the Rod Stewart-like \\"Effect and Cause\\" also deliver. Sadly not as good as Get Behind Me Satan - sad because after that album, I was expecting this to be an unbeatable five-star, or at least a solid four-star. A bit of a letdown, then, but nothing too bad.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|That is how I am going to describe this album...gorgeous!    I have been a HUGE Kelly fan since 2002 when she won American Idol, and I can say in all honestly that this is her best album yet!    I, personally, thought Breakaway was a downgrade from Thankful. I thought Thankful was much more soulful and showed off her impeccable vocals. Then...My Decmember came out. A CD that not only shows her amazing vocals, but shows you just how amazing she is at songwriting.    Definitely a CD you HAVE to HAVE!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I'm biased.    I own the original [[ASIN:6305127689 Top Gun]] DVD, the [[ASIN:B0002WZTOI Top Gun (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)]] DVD, the [[ASIN:B000RZGIQ8 Top Gun [Blu-ray]]], and now the HD-DVD.    Top Gun is awesome (look at the plentiful amount of reviews), and if you didn't know that, it's time to find out!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|We are enjoying this series.  I have not watched season 6 yet but I know it will be as exciting as the others. The product was received in a timely manner and I believe in good condition.
B00004RF8J|5.0|i love this movie it is fun and funny it has comedy and action and murder  a evil plant what more could you ask for
B000MRAAJW|1.0|We must be technologically behind, I guess, because we were unable to view this HD DVD on any of our DVD players.  In full disclosure, we only have one HD DVD player in the house, but it still didn't work there.  The most unfortuneate aspect is that we gave the set as a gift to my dad for Father's Day, and he couldn't even view it!!  He also has a (fairly new) HD DVD player.  Inside the box there is a little note about going online to your player's manufacturer's website and finding out about available software upgrades for your player, so that you can view these DVDs \\"created using the latest technology\\".  I wish I would have known this when I was purchasing, I would have just ordered the regular (non-HD) version.
1591841666|3.0|I'm a big fan of Seth Godin, and I've read both his standard and The Dip blogs frequently.  So obviously, I couldn't wait to read the book.    Overall, I thought it was an entertaining, quick read.  However, I thought that the underlying message really could have been summed up in a lengthy blog post.    Regardless, it's worth reading.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|The movie arrived on time, there were no scratches, I definitely got more than my money's worth, especially since I got this at such a good low price, AND I absolutely LOVE this movie, so everything was just EXCELLENT!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I just rented the DVD after several people told me how wonderful it was. This guy has no charisma. I could have cared less about what happened to him or the girl.What a total waste of my time! I am surprised at all the great reviews of this movie. And what a waste of Judy Dench! I'm not waiting for the next Bond if this guy is going to be the next 007!
B000QFCD2W|5.0|guys what can I say , best CD , best band , best voice , best horror story, best metal release of 2007. Please buy it you won't be dissapointed!!!!!!
B000002L42|4.0|Although surprises are few, this is an interesting album not only for Dan fans, but for beginners as well. The band is really good, and Donald Fagen's vocals are excellent. Walter Becker? Well, you can actually hear him singing on one song, Book of liars from his solo album. Not bad.  <br />  <br />So, what's the deal with Alive in America? Well, like any live album, it's kind of a greatest hits collection. But this time without quite a few of the expected ones. Among omitted songs are Do it again, Rikki don't lose that number and Doctor Wu, which for many fans rank among the top ten Steely Dan songs. These omissions pave the way for less salient songs to shine, such as Sign in stranger and the magical version of Third world man. It's done somewhat slower than on Gaucho, and Fagen's vocals are more intense.   <br />  <br />in general, though, the songs sound much like the original studio versions. The three concluding albums from the original Dan run dominate, with two songs from Gaucho, three from Aja, and three from The royal scam. These are the most conceptual, held-together albums, and possibly the ones Fagen and Becker are the most satisfied with. So Alive in America could be seen as their own choice of great Steely Dan songs, which differs in several ways from collections like Gold or A decade. This makes the album well worth owning, not only for long-time fans, but definitely for newcomers too.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I saw Serenity on cable and for no apparent reason.  It was going to be on, I read a review and so I watched.  I'd never seen, nor heard of Firefly at this point in time.      I just loved this movie and I didn't know why.  Something about it was just so great. Movies like this come along for people sometimes. It's all about personal taste, and this one suited mine (and many others as well).  It became the movie that I would fall asleep to on several nights. Soothing, I guess you could say.    Once I realized that there was a whole season of Serentity out there in a boxed set called Firefly, I bought it right away.  Loved that too.  Probably even more than the movie.    Anyways. Buy the movie. Buy the Series. Buy everything, and then buy it again for your best friend.  If enough people do that, maybe if we're lucky, we'll get another movie or a 2nd chance on the show. If not, well, at least we'll have what we got!    Keep flying
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great series with some of the best nature photography ever. David Attenborough's narration conveys his awe of his subject matter brilliantly.  Beware the American release version with the Sigourney Weaver narration, which is soporific.
B00006879E|4.0|not as good as the second cd.  the tracks tangled and harder to breathe are great alternative rock songs.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly changed her style, gained some fans, and lost some too. She mad a multitude of risky decisions with this album, and they paid off tremendously. She shed her pop image, and got creative. The albums flaws come from sometimes simple lyrics and songs like Never Again. But don't worry, she showcases her good writing style with the somg Irvine, the best song on the entire album, and possible the best song she has made. I give this 5 stars because it is a good album, but more importantly I am happy Kelly refused to be a cookie-cutter pop singer, and instead she \\"spread her wings and flies\\" in her new album.

B000P2A256|5.0|it was a great cd. i like the songs wake up call and makes me wonder.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|Maybe I just have to listen to it a few more times... it kind of loses me after track 3... I had nothing against Get Behind Me Satan, only that it wasn't as good as Elephant.  I MISS the catchy stuff... and other than Icky Thump (title track) nothing is catching my attention off this one just yet.  There is some killer guitar work, but I miss Meg's ballads...  It'll happen again, I suppose.  One reviewer mentioned GBMS as their possible dud.  So far for me, this may be it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|White Blood Cells was my introduction to the White Stripes, but it was the stripped-down spirit of De Stijl that cemented me as a Stripes fan. So my heart nearly leaped from my chest as the first few bars of Icky Thump signaled the return of the Stripes blues/garage-rock sensibilities. However, the Stripes have learned from five albums experience, and Icky Thump filters the spirit of their initial two offerings through a   production filter like that of WBC and Elephant, with Get Behind Me Satan's willingness to experiment dashed on top. While there are some songs that I haven't warmed to yet, Icky Thump is a solid album all around. Here are some of the highlights:    1. Icky Thump- Jack's distorted guitar and falsetto are the perfect vessel for brilliant lyrics and start the album off right.    2. You Don't Know Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)- A softer , more bluesy track than the opener, the second track more than holds it own with singing that reminds me of a more uptempo I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet) with a strong catchy progression playing on top.     3. Conquest- The only song on the album not written by Jack, Conquest adds a mariachi band to Meg's driving beat and Jack's guitar. The effect is brilliant, and extremely original.    4. Rag And Bone- With a driving intro that invokes Golden Earring's Radar Love, Jack and Meg banter back and forth, while the rest of the song kinda reminds me of Broken Bricks off the Stripes' first album. Very enjoyable.    5. A Martyr For My Love For You- By far my favorite song on the album, a riff similar to Dave Matthews' Gravedigger plays over some of the best lyrics Jack has ever written. Words simply cannot do this song justice; an utter stroke of genius.    6. Effect and Cause- The swan song of the album is a very simple song, without much of the heavy distortion that characterizes much of Icky Thump. However, it's extremely catchy, and Jack's lyrics hold up to just about anything else on the album.    Although Icky Thump isn't exactly like anything the Stripes have done before, much of the best elements of their past albums shine through on Icky Thump, making it a solid part of their discography.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was passed over by me and only watched after I had watched [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity [Blu-ray]]], this movie was great and the characters like Mel really drew me into the world they were portraying.<br /><br />After learning the movie was based on a TV series FireFly,I went and brought this off of Amazon. I then proceeded to watch the whole series in one weekend. I would describe the setting as space cowboy. It has a western feel with a science fiction twist.<br /><br />I would recommend this to fans of any science fiction and to fans of great TV shows in general. This series was cancel before the first season was finished and leaves the viewer's wanting more. I can only imagine how big this series would have been if it had not been cancelled. I could see this show being more liked than Star Wars, if given the time.
1594489505|3.0|The cultural description for women in Afganistan is both enlightening & depressing.  Mariam is by far the most courageous heroine & presents a fascinating role model for the other woman of note.  I was disappointed by the fact that this book was not as reiveting as The Kite Runner.
B000002L68|5.0|This was, of course, Prince's breakthrough album, packed with huge hits: two #1's (\\"When Doves Cry\\", a bassless dance track; sterling funk-rocker \\"Let's Go Crazy\\"), one #2 (the slow, moving title track), and another Top 10 hit to boot (\\"I Would Die 4 U\\", Messianic but catchy), as well as the infamous \\"Darling Nikki\\" (which transcends \\"sexually suggestive\\") that spurred friggin' Tipper Gore to start the PRMC (an insult to everyone who believes in freedom of speech).Needless to say, it was huge -while I wasn't around during the decade, I think it was an '80s pop culture touchstone and certainly the album that made Prince a household name. It's also quite creative - check the bizarre ending to \\"Darling Nikki\\", which sounds like they chopped up and rearranged tapes or the one-ma nfunk-rock jam \\"Computer Blue\\". Add that to Prince's guitar, bass and keyboard playing everywhere (only Eddie Hazel is a better funk-rock guitarist) - particularly his guitar soloing on \\"When Does Cry\\"; \\"Computer Blue\\" and the title song. He's possibly the most talented multi-instrumentalists of our time, though Eric Dolphy and Brian Jones are stiff competitors. Topping it off is \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", a personal favorite of mine - it's one of the most intense, cathartic songs I've ever heard. So much for my perception of the '80s being totally soulless. Anyway, my only complaint - and a small one at that - is \\"Take Me With U\\" - not a bad song, but disarmingly sunny. Doesn't at all fit in with the rest of the album. Still, if this isn't his best album, it's second to Dirty Mind. (Oh, almost forgot the party song \\"Baby I'm a Star\\" - yet another standout song, the most traditional funk song here).
1600240003|5.0|This next book in the Harry Bosch series is a great read, continuing in the tradition of great detective novels.
B00005614M|5.0|The songs on The Birth of the Cool are like the ninja of old. They do what they need to, fast, and leave. But unlike ninja attacks, these songs (which include classics like \\"Jeru\\", \\"Venus de Milo\\" and \\"Boplicity\\") are not painful in the least. The arrangements are tight and the songs are melodic, slightly Hollywood-esque but quite beautiful and well-performed. The songs themselves are also quite brief, as I implied a few sentence back - nothing over five minutes, in fact. The nonet plays together quite well, complementing each other throughout. They all have the mellow sound down - the album kinda sounds alike, but with great songs like \\"Rogue\\", \\"Rocker\\" and \\"Israel\\" on hand, who can complain? Now the only song I don't really like is \\"Darn That Dream\\", which falls in my list of Ten Songs We've All Heard Too Many Times Before. As for the rest? Get it. Not before Kind of Blue, 'Round about Midnight or In a Silent Way, but still get it!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I've played Meteora so many times I've had to buy 2 copies within 2 years cause the first disk got so worn out. This CD's looking to meet the same fate. It's been in constant rotation in my player since I first got it. I love the mellowness of most of the tracks, and they've got just enough tracks that sound like their older stuff that it keeps everything moving. BUY IT!
B00006WUWQ|5.0|These movies are great fun to watch with our teenage kids.  Even though they are from the 90's they are still hillarious!  After watching one of them, our family imitates the  characters and we have lots of silly fun ....  The world needs more silly fun!!
B00005QW5X|5.0|Having seen this film in the theatre twice, I don't know what took me so long to buy the DVD - I enjoy it every time I watch it!  It has great heart and empathy and the music is fantastic! John Cameron Mitchell is enchanting as well as the whole cast. It is absurd, outrageous and yes, lovingly done. I especially liked Michael Pitt - he is one of my favorite actors - puts his whole being into every character he portrays.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I thought watching 'Black Snake Moan' was going to be an ordeal.  While the premise and execution are blatantly different, the movie didn't leave me with a nasty sense that I expected.  Taking place in the deep South, we have a pervading atmosphere of oppressive heat.  The film immediately introduces us to the Blues with Son House filmed in black and white expounding how love will have us \\"hide all fault\\" and suffer from \\"...sad blues...\\".    In the next scene we find Rae (Christina Ricci in a riveting performance) and Ronnie (Justin Timberlake with an excellent performance) in a steamy love scene.  Soon he's going off to the army, leaving her in great need from his absence.  On the other side of town associate preacher \\"Laz\\" Lazarus (Samuel Jackson in an effective departure) is dumped by his wife in a difficult discussion that takes place in a public cafe' and ends in an argument.  Going back and forth we see how Rae and Laz each disintegrate until they cross paths.  She has serial sexual encounters, and Laz sinks deep into the blues, both musically and spiritually.  He doesn't attend church and confronts Angela's new love interest at the pool hall.  One night while boozing, Rae encounters Ronnie's best friend who is gentlemanly enough to take her home, but turns violent when she drunkenly mocks his manhood.  Left unconscious on the roadside, she is lucky enough to be alive and close to Laz's farmhouse.  In the morning he finds her and takes her in his house and reduces her fever.  She is so delirious that she becomes a danger to herself, so he does the unthinkable:  He shackles her with chains to keep her from running away.  In the following scenes he tries to sermonize her with senior pastor, Rev. R.L. (John Cothran), while assisting her recovery.  In his own way he helps to restore her feminine dignity and bring her back to life.      'Black Snake Moan' is such a worthy departure from most movies.  It's also refreshing to see Samuel Jackson in such a different role than previous ventures.  The movie's thrust is toward our universal craving for love and acceptance and coming to terms with our weaknesses.  Although certainly more than a modern update of 'My Fair Lady,' 'Black Snake Moan' lays on the line the lust to love transcendence we all seek.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Highly creative story line sweeps you up and carries you in like you can't imagine. It is hard to imagine such a thing for a world that is so bizarre from ours, yet it is masterfully done. The movie does not feel \\"rushed\\" like a lot of movies these days, but at the same time never drags. Attention to detail is very evident throughout the whole movie.    I would simply caution that for young kids there are some disturbing scenes. When they are a little older, however, they will thank you for owning it.
B00000I2PG|5.0|After doing some research I discovered that the U.S. 2002 digitally remastered reissue of ABC's classic 1982 'The Lexicon Of Love' album is the exact same as the U.K. 1998 digitally remastered issue.  I own the U.S. release, which has a 1982 and 1998 Mercury Records Ltd. (London) copyright.  However, the disc is manufactured by Island Def Jam in New York.<br /><br />So what does this mean for the fans?  Those hoping for a newly remastered 2002 issue won't find it here, yet that doesn't matter because the digital remastering here is simply the best I've heard for this album as a whole.  After browsing through my ABC collection and comparing sound quality on a number of the releases I was surprised to hear that this 1998 digital remaster sounds better than any other ABC release, with the exception of the album material on the 2004 'Ultimate Collection' 3-disc set from Universal Netherlands (\\"All Of My Heart\\" being the lone exception).<br /><br />Additionally, the sound quality presented here is MUCH better than the 2004 'Deluxe Edition' of the album.  It's a shame I have to say that because the 2004 edition has a bunch more goodies on it.  Usually I find more recent remasters sounding better than remasters from the late 90's, but this is simply not the case here.  The difference is the result of different mastering engineers.  This 1998 release was remastered by Dick Beetham at Tape to Tape.  The 2004 'Deluxe Edition' was remastered by Gary Moore.  It's a shame Univeral didn't throw the 2004 edition back at Dick again because he did a nearly flawless job.<br /><br />In my review of the 2004 'Deluxe Edition' I stated how the songs sound flat by today's audio standards.  This is simply not the case here.  The songs are rich, full, wide, and clean.  Listen to those drums at 3:18 in '4 Ever 2 Gether' and it's clear that this one is the winner!  Honestly, I had completely forgot how well this album sounded after being stuck on the 2004 'Deluxe Edition' for a few years now.<br /><br />\\"All Of My Heart\\" sounds the best here out of any ABC CD I've heard.  I mentioned the harsh sound in the 2004 'Ultimate Collection' review.  It sounds rather flat in the 2001/2002 'The Very Best Of' and of course 2004 'Deluxe Edition', but it's just right here!  Perfect dynamics, presentation, and range.  Moreover, unlike the 'Deluxe Edition', \\"The Look Of Love (Part IV)\\" does not annoyingly fade out early and sound cut off.  It's presented completely here and in better sound, to top it off!<br /><br />Usually, I'm not one to go back to late 90's remasters and give solid reviews.  This is, of course, one of a few examples in which I can actually praise an earlier remaster over a more recent one.  It's a shame that Universal didn't bother reissuing this album as a stand alone disc in 2005 with the other album remasters, perhaps this time including extra bonus tracks beyond the 1 presented here, such as the 12\\" of \\"The Look Of Love\\", which seems to be skipped on several ABC collections.<br /><br />As for the album itself, read the reviews here.  It's a classic!  I need not explain any further.  This album was originally released on June 25, 1982.  Twenty-five years later, it still sounds as striking and fresh as it did when originally released.  Do yourself a favor and add this crisp remaster to your collection, if you haven't already.r a few years now.    <br />  <br />\\"All Of My Heart\\" sounds the best here out of any ABC CD I've heard.

B000QFCD2W|5.0|I won't spoil the party and tell you the story here. I will just say that for metal guitar freaks like me this album is a present from... heaven? :-D Well, no mater from where it came, this CD is a true guitar fest. The solos from Mike Wead and Andy Larocque are simply amazing. There's no lacking ingredient in their playing: technique, melody, taste, speed and aggression. I specially like Mike's solos this time, because his tone is awesome and his phrasing is expressive as... hell? ;-)    About the album itself, King Diamond is to me the real metal deal: horror mini-operas told through almost-progressive metal formulas -- but still sounding pure and raw, like true metal should be. The idea is truly original and the formula does work for me all the time. \\"Give me your soul... please!\\" is no exception. Of course, King is not breaking any ground anymore and this is absolutely more of the same, but that's *THE SAME* I love to hear and that's what I like from King Diamond: consistency, quality and loyalty to himself. After all, King has already innovated, so it's OK to reuse the innovations to craft a bunch of great albums, one after another.     Now the unavoidable: compared to \\"The Puppet Master\\", I think the previous album had more melodic hooks, while \\"Give me your soul... please!\\" is more guitar-oriented. Also, I got the impression King uses more his middle range this time, but I always loved his \\"natural\\" voice, so that's fine to me. If I had to rank the new album respect to other King's efforts, this still is in my top five or six. The story is great and wicked, so our Halloween-esque desires will be more than satisfied. If you add to the story the band's total mastery of metal cliches, you get a super-boosted package of the finest metal extract ever.    So, to conclude the review, I love the cover, the white letters for the lyrics on the booklet and all the artwork in general. Heavy metal fans need releases like this one, so this scores five stars in my book without hesitation. Just go BUY IT NOW and support artists like King, as he truly deserves kudos for his craftsmanship and authenticity. In fact, buy all the albums from King Diamond. I bet you won't regret it. You'll spend many creepy nights reading the stories while listening to a great metal score, so it is worth the price, believe me -- actually, joy is priceless! -- and by the way, thank you, King!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great show!  A cross between sci-fi and the old west with a touch of Eastern/Asian influence and lots of well written humor.  Yes, it's different, but I absolutely love it!

This is truely an amazing piece of work compiled into a beautifuly filmed and narrated production.  Watching this on a good TV (42\\" plasma in my home)can be breath taking!    David's narration has much more character then Sigorny Weavers recorded efforts which was broadcast in the USA.        p.s. While a lot of the video was recorded with High Definition cameras there is still much footage which is \\"standard\\".  This does not impact the viewing experiance.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly really lets loose on this album.  I've read many reviews around the net and the only reason some people dislike the album is because it's not very commercial, or mainstream.  The lyrics are good, the music is good, Kelly's voice is great.  The songs are spectacular and are more on the rockier side than the pop/rock of Breakaway.  Been a fan of Kelly's albums from the beginning, and this one is no exception.  I can't stop listening to it.
1594489505|3.0|Bonding Amongst Ruins<br />A review by Kiran Desai<br />Of Khaled Hosseini's novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".<br />Khaled Hosseini weaves another splendid tale in his new book, \\" A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" We are presented with a realistic picture of brutality that has prevailed in that world for the last quarter of a century. In fact, the conflict in that land dates back almost to the time Alexander the Great crossed Persia to conquer India. Once a crossroad between the two ancient civilizations, Persia and India, it constantly attracted the warlords (new terminology - old tale) for pride and profit. As a result the Afghan people are used to fighting and have the makings of excellent warriors. But along with war games came the responsibility to protect their females and the religion provided a convenient cover for a patriarchic society in Afghanistan. Even without the religious support, we see the male domination etched in stone in ancient cultures enforced by brutal social customs such as  \\"foot-binding\\" in China and FGM in Africa. Lisa See, in her recent novel, \\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan \\" narrates the story of cruelty inflicted on Chinese women by their society and shows how the side benefit is the bonding between women. Hosseini too dexterously leads us through minefields of cruelty to show us how bonding and love can flourish in the rubble of social devastation. It is a story of oppression and betrayals that leave little hope for the loving protagonists Mariam and Laila. Mariam, the loyal wife is put through a wringer when she fails to produce a son by a husband who is almost twice her age. He makes her eat pebbles and breaks her teeth because she did not cook the rice soft enough to please his mood du jour. He takes up with a war orphan, a bright and high-spirited fourteen-year-old Laila, whose mother was Mariam's coeval and who is almost a quarter of Rasheed's age. There is natural mistrust for the younger bride. Yet amidst the beatings and betrayals of both by their husband and the men who rule the land, the initial animosity and mistrust evaporates to make room for a fragile flower of love between the two wives of Rasheed.<br />Unfortunately this is no Kite Runner. The Kite Runner is also a tale of intrigue and betrayal, though mainly among men, but it is a spellbinding story at many levels. The Kite Runner weaves the story of Rustom and Sohrab, a story of not knowing the identity of your father/son, to delve deeper and allow us to understand how parents and children have to discover the true identity, the core personality, of each other. The Kite Runner develops the story of the loyalty of Hassan, a lowly Hazra but a pure soul full of the most loveable saintly qualities, and cowardice of Amir, a spoiled brat who hid behind the superior status accorded to him by the society. Interestingly both these novels develop a story of love between a father and his child out of wedlock. Both betray the loving innocent child to save face in society. A Thousand Splendid Suns is a fairly simple story designed to tug at your heartstrings through a tear jerking portrayal of a backward society where men ruthlessly treat women with impunity and brag about it under the guise of having superior religious values.y their husband and the men who rule the land, the initial animosity and mistrust evaporates to make room for a fragile flower of love between the two wives of Rasheed.

0790740443|4.0|This movie reminds me of the graphic novel War Machine. The novel is about a genetically created soldier who was trained since birth to serve with unfaltering loyalty and does so until he is abandoned. Both the book and the movie have that similar story of a futuristic soldier trained since birth who defies his leaders for a moral solution. They are two very different and specific stories mind you. But I digress. Soldier is kind of a mixed bag of action and a little heart, with some quirks as well. Ultimately what you get is a great movie with some gaping flaws that still make it a pretty good flick in the end.     I think the biggest feather in this movie's cap is seeing dispossessed soldier Todd, played by Kurt Russell, interact with civilians and try to unlearn his conditioning. It is not done in a cheesy way like having Todd shed his first tear or anything like that. The script seems to respect the fact that you cannot change yourself overnight. Also there is a love interest of sorts that is pretty much unrequited. At least through the course of the movie. Again these things don't change overnight. Kurt hardly says a line and still shines in this movie. Some might disagree, but I think Kurt Russel's acting was very well done and appropriate for the kind of character he was. Most of it is in his eyes. The acting is real subtle but very effective.    Cinematography was nice. Colored lenses were used in basic but effective ways. The junk planet landscape gave a good post-apocalyptic feel (again with color filters adding to the ambience). The guns and tech should keep you military types drooling. Big guns and even more massive assault vehicles were definitely fun to see in action. The special effects are very good and not overdone, and thats always a nice touch.      The plot is solid enough. The thing is they do some odd things in the movie. I mean REALLY odd things like officers ordering these super soldiers to fight each other to the death to prove a point and other strangeness. The truly stupid stuff comes around the end when Todd goes toe to toe with newer soldiers. I can't figure out why genetically enhanced soldiers that are made to ignore pain scream like little girls when they are dying. Also the soldiers themselves don't seem to have much of a concept of small unit tactics. They just walk in and shoot. I suppose that is explained well enough with captains and colonels arguing over the unit having no real combat experience. Todd doesn't seem to have a problem using surprise tactics, but the 'new recruits' didn't seem to get it. I don't know... this military of the future is pretty dirt dumb.    This DVD is pretty sparse on special features, but you do get a pretty informative commentary by director Paul Anderson, co-producer Jeremy Bolt and Jason Isaacs (the mean colonel from the movie). One little tidbit they clarify on the commentary is how this movie is supposed to be part of the Blade Runner universe. If you have a good eye you will catch little hints in the movie as well (if not the commentary will point them out for you). Other than that you get get some production notes, the trailer and some subtitles in English and French. Not exactly a sweet lineup, but you do get a good commentary.     Soldier is a good film. I think Russell and the social evolution of his character Todd is what makes the movie more than just another sci-fi shoot fest. If the story overview sounds interesting to you and you can forgive some oddball soldier maneuvers then go ahead and see this movie. Soldier won't win any awards, but I finished watching it thinking the movie was pretty good.
1594489505|4.0|This is the 2nd book that Khaled Hosseini has written.  It is very good but I did not love it as much as Kite Runner.  This book is about a young illigitimate daughter of a wealthy man that is forced to marry (arranged) a much older man.  He is initially decent but becomes abusive to her.  He takes on a second wife and the two wives have a hatred that later becomes a loyal deep love.
006441034X|5.0|I would like to say that I enjoyed this book greatly. It is very well written, in rich but comprehensible language. The caracters are interesting, manyfold and very much alive. Howl in the book resembles Howl of Hauru no ugoku shiro. But what I found particularly thrilling was that there are many situations in the book, not included in the movie. I won't tell you what they are, of course, but I guarantee that they are totally worth reading the book and finding out. If you liked the movie, this is definitely the book for you, no matter how old you are. Its atmosphere is incredible, magical. And with just the right amount of romance in it. All in all, it was a wonderful read worth every penny. I've read it once and am going to reread it right now. So, sorry, but I gotta go. Read. Bye.

B000001F3C|4.0|I find it hard to believe that I have never written a review for this album.<br />First of all I believe U2 had never been as rocking and driven as they were with WAR, they have not been since it either.<br />Song by song the album might not seem as good, but this is one of those strange situations where the whole is much more than the sum of it's parts.<br />This album features their first two real master pieces New year's day and drowning man.<br />The latter not as known to newer fans, it is a haunting song that provides us with a different U2.<br />The anger and determination, their youthful energy, talent and focus, just blended perfectly in this album, creating the epic closer for their early album trilogy.<br />If this album misses the label 'masterpiece' is by frustrating inches, probably because of \\"The refugee\\" it would have been a much stronger record without it, as it stops the flow of the record and sounds totally out of place.<br />This is all of course my opinion... but I feel WAR is light years ahead in terms of musical and lyrical contents than pretty much most of their albums, specially their two newer ones (yes that ones that sound like a rehash of their \\"old\\" sound cough *sellouts* cough) All that you can't leave behind and How to dismantle an atomic bomb.<br /><br />WAR<br />Master pieces: New year's day, Drowning man<br />Oustanding songs: Sunday bloody sunday, Seconds, Like a song...,<br />Good songs: Two hearts beat as one, surrender, red light<br />Regular songs: 40 (Great lyrics and all but as a song itself it feels weird)<br />Bad songs: The refugee<br /><br />If you have heard U2 and recall their \\"old\\" albums (Joshua tree, Unforgettable fire)<br />Do yourself a favour and listen to their true old sound and roots... I guarantee this four young lads will impress you way beyond the Joshua tree and you will, now, truly know what you REALLY can't leave behind.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This film is so weak and boring in so many ways, that it's a waste of time bothering to write a review. The only reason I am doing this is to prevent readers from investing in something based on the hype surrounding this film, and its bland leading man Daniel Craig.<br /><br />Now, I am sure Daniel Craig is a nice enough man, but he is woefully miscast in the role of Bond. He brings literally nothing to the role, and all his limpid blue eye-action cannot save this from the train wreck it actually is. Not that he is a bad-looking person, but this is one actor who has virtually no charisma and has very wooden body language, so much so that even during his so called erotic scenes, he seems bored and disinterested, more keen on forcing the camera to love him. No Daniel, this just does not work. This is by far the worst Bond ever, especially since Pierce Brosnan set such a high standard for anyone to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that Eva Green (the royal from \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\") is a sure find. She is beautiful in that most obscure way (such as Claire Forlani in \\"Meet Joe Black\\") that its impossible to hate her. In fact, if they had made a whole film about her instead, maybe this wouldn't have been such a terrible film. She isn't a talented actress per se, but is absolutely perfect as a Bond girl.<br /><br />Which brings us to the storyline, or lack of one. Of all the remakes, this is the worst, primarily due to Craig's constant expression of ongoing indigestion, coupled with a very weak backing cast. Judi Dench's allure and charisma are all flushed down the toilet, as she is portrayed her as an insecure and rather matronly mother-figure, with some of the worst one-liners. Should be seen to be believed. I cannot believe they reduced this amazing character to the bowl of mush we see before us today.<br /><br />Maybe its because I'm a guy, but I do not find Daniel Craig capable of acting to save his life, and the people I saw this with were as puzzled as I was. Why did they choose this obviously untalented abomination to play Bond? One will never know. All I can say is, if you're planning on buying this on DVD, please hold off of it. Don't even rent it, its that bad.<br /><br />A slow, tedious film, with no worth whatsoever. One star for Eva Green, and that's one star too many.ntalented abomination to play Bond?

B000NVIXFK|5.0|This has to be their best release since \\"Power Windows\\" or \\"Hold Your Fire.\\"  Each time I listen to Snakes & Arrows, I like it better and better.
0345494768|5.0|This book is phenomenal!  I've been a star wars fan since age 3; saw it in the theatre in '77 and yes...it's left an impact.  I'm fascinated by historical events and how things are made.  The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film (Star Wars)by J.W. Rinzler is no exception.  You book was resonably priced and fun to read.    Petesasauce
1931559317|5.0|Features I like:     + Highly detailed & labeled however not over-detailed.   + Spiral bound is very handy.   + Made of good quality paper.  + Small (like medium notebook) and light weight - great for backyard observations. You don't sprain your hand when you carry it.  + Great bargain for small price!  + Good Index including Messier objects.  + Detailed maps of pleaids, Virgo clusters etc.    Features I like less:    - Its size is also a disadvantge: divided to many charts that sometimes makes you confused. Can be difficult to navigate if you don't have a basic knowledge of sky.  - The spiral bound might cause pages to deteriorate in time.  - Lack of monthly maps that show the sky and the constelations change.    In a nutshell: Great bargain for the price. Very handy for observations. Best for the average stargazer.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I stumbled on this by accident while looking for another blues cd (big blues fan). I read about how Kenny Wayne Sheperd wanted to connect with these old blues pioneers and it sounded like it might be worth a try.He and his crew have put together one of the most entertaining documentories  I have ever seen.The cd is fantastic as well with track after track of pure blues. If you are a blues fan this DVD/CD combo is a must. You won't be disappointed.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This is one of the top ten movies of the 1980's to come out that is a must see! This movie is an endearing story about friendship and the wonderful memories of childhood.  Tom Hanks of course carries off the character very well and makes you love him!  This extended version is great because it gives more details than the original version that were left unanswered.  I loved it back then when it first came out and I love it even more now!!  Great Flick!
0393327345|5.0|Let me start by saying that Fight Club is one of my favorite movies, but I had never read the book. Chuck Palahniuk is an amazing writer- especially considering that this is his first novel. While it is very similar to the movie, I still found it very enjoyable despite the fact that obviously you know what is going to happen. I loved this book and just went and bought two more by Palahniuk.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I didn't much care for the last few MegaDeth albums, but this one has reignited my appreciation for their music.   In a sense faster and leaner than recent offerings, I enjoyed this album quite a bit.
B000002GJH|3.0|Cornell was better with both Soundgarden and Audioslave, but this is definitely better than his solo career material and worth a purchase if you're a fan of Soundgarden or Pearl Jam.
0743496728|5.0|This is Jodi Picoult's best work . . . hands down!  I was gripped to the story from page 1 and on.  As a teacher, I see bullying behaviors far too often.  Ms. Picoult make the reader empathize with the young man who is victimized.  Students should never be pushed to such destructive acts of violence.  This book make school violence real.  SHe allows the reader to see the issue from different points of view, & different people/perceptions.  And, she levels your view of the story right at the  end.  I was in awe at the end and for that I thank her!  She is a phenomenol writing!  I look forward to many more, , , ,but they will be hard to top \\"19 Minutes\\"
B000FL7CAK|5.0|fantastic.. if you start watching you get addicted in now time..  it's just a shame that people don't appriciate high quality tv without superficiality..
B000G73U5Y|5.0|A superb anthology of the best of Steely Dan.  A pleasing walk down memory lane.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I did not know anything about Celtic Woman before I bought this product. I have a lot of concert DVD's, but this turned out to become one of my top favorites. I don't know how many times I have watced it, it is just marvelous. I have showed it to many of my friends, who also has been taken away by the beautiful music, fantastic setting and outstanding performers!!    Tron Syversen, Norway
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched Firefly many times but I would like to own it. I am so happy to have them now - The complete Series-  and I can watch it at any time I like. Wonderful!
B000P2A256|5.0|Must have for those familiar with this band's music.  No doubt this will be another smash hit for them!
B000803CU2|5.0|Does anyone know if this import version is remastered ?  I can't tell from the description.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|Great lyrics, melodies, and overall theme.  My favorite of there recent (last decade albums).  I have seen the Scorps 7 times live (BEST live band I've ever seen), even met them in 1984 at Caesars Palace by chance after they played in Las Vegas (Love at First Sting Tour), great group of guys, totally down to earth..Clause was actually a little timid and shy and quite dimunitive..but what a voice. The Ballads on this album are very good...Hour 1, Humanity and 321  cool songs too, all the songs are good start to finish....I'm not quite sure why this band is not given there props here in the states..they have been very good for very long time.....they blow the stones of the stage.....where is Guns and Roses, Motley Crew, Def Leapard, Priest, Ozzy, Van Halen, etc, etc, etc?  None have had the longevity of the Scorps.....Oh and by the way...Always Somewhere is one of the best ballads ever and gets no talk.....My opinion....best rock band of all time..hands down
1400032717|5.0|If you are on the fence about whether to read this book, do yourself a favor and READ IT!  It is easily the best teen fiction book that I've ever read...one of the best as an adult as well.  I am looking for more books written by Haddon!
1582701709|1.0|Okay, the problem I have with this book, is that it claims that we attract both positive and negative events in our lives. So if I got in an accident two years ago and was sued for $30,000 I attracted that upon myself. Okay, that's fine, but what about when I was 5 and was molested by a man, did I attract that upon me too? What about my grandparents living out amazing lives and all of the sudden being struck by world war 2 and were forced to go through hell, did they attract that upon themselves? What about this woman I know who lost all of her adorable 4 kids in a fire. She raised them with such love, gave them education working hard day after day! Paris Hilton on the other hand must have thought something really positive for having all that she has and doing nothing! So what this book offers, is Eastern belief, similar to Hinduism and all of that which says that 'you're responsible for your destiny! You are the god of your life! There is no other force that is responsible for you life, but you!' That's where I have a problem with this book! Any of you who know the book of Job from the Old Testament will know that God took everything away from him, but because Job loved God still, God gave Job everything back twice as much. I know it's just the story, but I do believe that God, no other force permits or blocks things from happening in our lives. Sometimes things dont' seem fair. For example, why would a child be born blind and deaf? I really do believe that such children are angels brought by God into our world for us to learn from! I know a family who changed their corrupt ways after they had a child born with down syndrome. They're the happiest and nicest people because of that kid now. God will not forget tears, or suffer. God blesses those who cry and punishes those who cause the crying. When my uncle was working one day on a construction, he heard a voice that told him to move away from that spot he was standing at, and as soon as he did, it blew up. There was no one there, but the voice was so clear. All because he simply prays every morning to start out his day in blessings. This book makes people ask more \\"spiritual\\" questions as if it was a good thing. But it's not. It's a hook! If you start asking more question on the lives and examples of those innocent people's suffering I brought up above, the answer would be: \\"There is a past life, those people must have done something to attract trouble in their next life.\\" See? It gets you deeper and deeper into all this mumbo-jumbo crap!  The question is then, if there is a past life, but there is no God (remember, God has \\"forsaken\\" you and you are responsible to attract all the goodness to yourself now), who in the world will transfer you safely from your dead body into a new body? The universe? I got news for you! The universe, even though big, is made of rocks and gas, and matter just like the rest of us. All a creation! All was created by God! God so loved the world that He gave his only Son to die and pay for our sins, for our unbeliefs, for our spirit of Eve, wanting knowledge that is false, that is polluted. God has mercy and forgives. None of these type books made me happy! Only when I went back to the truth, and rebuild my relationship with God, that's when things started to make sense and the world appeared more clear, because God longs for us, He longs to make your life beautiful! This book will only make you live like in some kind of dream, some illusion... You will stress out trying to think positive, when all you have to do is trust God who knows every number of your hairs on your head! Jesus says that we should trust God, for He loves us so much more than the birds or the flowers in the fields that get nurtured from Him. So don't be mad at me for giving this book only one star! Drink the water of life, drink the word of God, and you will be wise and rich and anything you want for the will of God! I am not inviting you to be religious. I don't like the word religion. I don't like religious people. I've been kicked out of a church before, and was accepted and loved at another. So I know there are dead churches but there are also alive churches. But \\"The Secret\\" will rub you off of your money, and will only add more illusion to your already stressed out mind.ligion. I don't like religious people.
