B00G32VYDG|4.0|Pretty amusing storyline that is well presented with unexpected twists special effects are pretty good as well they could have used more of the humor aspect of both main characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the most intriguing and enjoyable games I have played on my Kindle. If you like puzzles that continually have you scratching your head, this game is for you. I was impressed by the attention to detail. It is one of the only games I've seen worth the price.
B000JMKNZQ|3.0|Love the book, but it's very repetitive.  If you can stomach the format, it's worth the read. Very Uplifting and inspiring.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The action was somewhat entertaining, and the visuals were neat, but the movie was so ridiculously cheesy and corny. I almost feel like they were trying to be as corny as possible. I guess I figured that Guillermo del Toro wouldn't put out such a horribly corny movie. I stand corrected.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very fun app and is easy to play and the quests r not hard to complete!! Plenty of chances to earn stuff so u don't have to spend money;)
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Fantastic CD by The Piano Guys!  They create enjoyable arrangements to classic holiday music.  There is no comparing to this new album.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The sequel to Ender s Game was just as well written but the story line wasn't as interesting to me.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I love action flicks and this is certainly a step above the awful Stallone film of similar name. Plenty of firepower to get through a weak plot.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|what can I say, it is ENTERPRISE and as expected is fantastic to watch, especially Jolene Blalock what else would you expect.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Two colossal tracks (&#34;Angel of Death&#34; and &#34;Reign in Blood&#34;) dominate this album along with other greats. A must-have thrash metal album. It's not very long, though.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I was unsure after reading reviews about tightness of disk inserts if I should order this and after viewing the entire set, I did find that disk 46 was damaged. As I can only get this disk replaced by returning the ENTIRE set I will just oreder the episodes on this disk from another source as the new set I may be sent could have MORE damaged disks and the cost and hassle of the return is not worth it. The rest of the set is awesome and I have enjoyed this very much. If it was not for the damaged disk I would rate this with 5 stars
B0002EXH5O|5.0|It's been in my car for weeks. Great album up and down the track selection, Marty and Mustaine's guitar work really works well together.
0399255370|1.0|This story looked cute enough, but as a mom, I pretty much disliked it.  The premise is adorable: the crayons go on strike list their grudges and there's a happy ending.  The pictures are pretty cute too and the artwork was well done and matched the text well.  I had two big problems with it.  The first is that the book just isn't really for kids.  It's the kind of book that adults think is funny and will enjoy reading, but I don't think really appeals to kids.  I was laughing, but my kids were both like, enough whiny crayons already, where's the story?  So if you put it in the same category with Go the $%^ to Sleep, it's a winner.  My kids 4.5 and 2.5 were just kind of bored.  My big problem though is with the tongue-in-cheek page about pink being a &#34;girl's color.&#34;  I know, the book was trying to point out how silly and limiting that is.  Bravo to the book for trying to change the minds of kids who think that.  The thing is, my kids don't really think that yet.  Maybe someday, they will, but I'd like for them to feel as though they have the whole rainbow to explore unencumbered for as long as possible.  It's like books refuting the existence of Santa, or teaching about monsters under the bed.  Fine, yes, someday they will pick that up at school and we'll deal with it then, but I'd rather not be the one to introduce the concept.  We may love this book in a few years when my kids get the joke, and my daughter is languishing in a pink abyss, but by then I suspect they'll have outgrown picture books.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics,easy to use a little help would be nice when settings up your weapons. Really fun to play. You do need to use two hands to aim and shoot.
B00GX50BD2|2.0|For a biographical film it sure has some poor character development. Woz at least explained his motivations.  Jobs remained a sort of an emotional mystery. Why was he his &#34;own worst enemy&#34; as was told to him multiple times? While it's obvious he cares fervently about the product's end result, he seems to go back and forth about his want of wealth and respect for others. &#34;Nerds&#34; seemed to want to work with him because he was so &#34;cool&#34; but there was no indication to me that he was &#34;cool&#34; even to a &#34;nerd&#34;. Scenes that seemed in need of explanatory dialogue were simply filled in with closeups of Jobs' near expressionless face or faraway shots of Jobs' hunched walking. While the movie spans 3 decades, each time period seems a little rushed as if there was nothing happening in between. This creates a confusing series of moments where everything is  going well, Jobs pushes everyone to create a great new product then skip ahead 10 years and everyone is obviously richer but hates Jobs even more because he costs the corporation too much money. Worse are the two cheesy &#34;Teamwork&#34; montages that are placed at the end of the first two decades. Overall, I finished the movie feeling like I had just watched the longest movie trailer in cinema history.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for daily readings and Bible readings. Don't believe any of the liars that state otherwise, it is not harmful to your pc or your tablet, or your phone, goodness to bring you closer to God
0143118757|5.0|Very relevant and useful book in the world where everyone want to get their side win. Working to understand basis for the any claim is important in any negotiation.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It was very easy to setup (I have IT experience).  I connected it to my iphone and was a little disapointed that there seems to be limits apps for it at this time (from the iphone) to youtube and netflix only.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|A very poorly made movie. It had a bad script, terrible acting and was so boring we couldn't make it through the first whole half hour.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book-and the continuation from &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34;  Very engrossing and well written.  I would love it if Grisham wrote more books about the Time to Kill characters.
0763627410|5.0|This is one of our favorite books!  The pictures are simple, yet fabulous!  And the story is so sweet. Makes a great baby shower gift.
1402786360|5.0|Gave to my daughter and she LOVES IT! The recipes are unusual and the full color photos are excellent. A great gift for someone who enjoys baking. Some recipes call for ingredients not in every cabinet; however, none of the recipes appear to be outrageously difficult.

1419705644|5.0|When I recived it in the mail I was slightly dissapointed at how small the book is but it is an interesting read.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a very sweet story. If you're a racing car fan, you'll love it even more. I'm not, but the story being told from the dog's perspective is very sweet. Reads pretty quick and is a feel good story when all is said and done.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Although it can be glitchy, I love this app.  The cat is so cute and loveable.  I wish there was more ways to make money.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|this album is some of the worst %#^& i have ever heard how rolling stone called this #2 album of the year is crazy!!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|The story is the most inspiring I have heard of a woman’s spirit and determination in a long time. The writing style gives away her age but it is still so wonderful that a woman in a society that trains females from birth that they are only worth the amount of male childern they can have stops and says no. The most inspiring thing is she clearly isn’t asking for special rights but only equal.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so good I started to play the computer version. I love the way you can  do any thing you want.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Always is and always will be a wonderful classic to read nice how they got Santa and the Nativity together.  just loved it
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Their version of O come, O come Emanuel is really the most beautiful I have ever heard...The Piano Guys are fast becoming my favorite, and a great addition to my Christmas Collection!
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|First, the less than stellar:<br /><br /> 1) the stage scenery was inappropriate to the era of the early and mid 16th century. This is especially so, in the early part of Act 3, during which we clearly see an overhead bank of florescent light fixtures, while Anne Boleyn’s (Anna Bolena) ladies-in-waiting make their entry into the “hall.” The rest of the set looked like steel girder framework, with vertically-moving tambour panels of brick, also not appropriate to the era.<br /><br /> 2) Elīna Garanča’s voice is excellent; however, her ability to express emotion reminds me much of Joyce DiDonato. Both just stand and deliver, with no effective emotion or the wrong emotions presented.<br /><br /> 3) When we have the appearance of Elizabeth 1st, Anne’s and Henry’s daughter, in Act 3, we’re presented with a young girl, of about the age of nine or ten, with blond hair. Elizabeth was a redhead and could have been no more than two and one-half years old, when Anne was executed. Anne and Henry were only married for a bit more than 3 years: January 25th, 1533~May 19th, 1536 and Elizabeth was born on the 7th of September, 1533, which confirms that Anne was early into her pregnancy, when they married. Anne’s execution took place on May 19th, 1536.<br /><br /> I can appreciate not wanting to dye the hair of a child but a simple wig would have sufficed, to make that more accurate and a more age-appropriate child would have been more realistic, if she had to be included at all, which was not necessary to the opera’s drama.<br /><br /> Now, the good:<br /><br /> All of the costumes were period appropriate, even though we do see some obvious zippers, in some of them, especially in that of Jane Seymour’s (Giovanna Seymour).gray and silver costume, in the latter part of Act 3, as well as some of the men’s “armor” costumes, at various times.<br /><br /> The quality of the singing, in general, plus the correct and appropriate emotions, were outstandingly presented, except as noted, above. Netrebko was magnificent!<br /><br /> This is a keeper, by all standards.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a different take on the assassination of President Kennedy.  It was extremely well written and researched.  It kept me in suspense, and the ending was appropriate, but it made me look back over the 50 years, and think, &#34;what if&#34;
B008FQ1O1K|3.0|I was expecting it to be more enlightening after seeing the writer on Dr Phil. I didn't find it to be so. Maybe i missed something.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There is a reason that this book maintains such high ratings for months now. It is quite captivating! I was skeptical to purchase it at first, because I had read What Alice Forgot and this sounded a lot different. That and the fact that this novel takes awhile to really get going. This is simply because Liane Moriarty gradually unfolds each character's story and does so within a string of events among their everyday lives. I for one would prefer that a novel interest me from the very beginning. The description of the book does a good job of that, but the first few pages kind of leaves you uninterested, but do not be discouraged because this is all part of the plan, the story, the course in which the book runs in order to tell Cecilia, Rachel, Tess, and Janie's stories.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The author did an amazing job bringing the book to life in your mind, like watching a movie and feeling the story unravel in front if you, you are able to feel the wind and taste the salt. Great read!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Having grown up in LA amongst the Entertainment Industry, stars, and beautiful people, I never knew that the heart of the Music Industry was right down the street. One would think I would have seen some of these artists in and around the San Fernando VAlley? In any case, this movie offers a real insiderr's look into the meat and potatoes of the Music Biz. I love the way it's edited and how competitive musicians and artists speak and shre openly about the music business. It is truly a fascinating video!
B00E9A656K|5.0|Amazing graphics Asphault 8 has them to but this is.outstanding for a drag race game. Game.play is awesome too! The gas is waiting but the cars Don't cost that much.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Wonderful book by a wise man. If you want to understand how and why you make certain decisions this is the book for you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing.<br />I'm no longer forced to watch network GARBAGE.<br />It is easy to set up if you already have a wireless switch installed.<br />Install is fast in windows, and with a little more effort you can install it in Mageia.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|This is an awesome movie. The script was very rich and well developed, the animation was amazing, and an un-Disney like ending. The movie focus on two princesses, Elsa and Anna, who are sisters (for those sick of Disney, it's here we go again, the same story). Elsa is born with enormous powers over ice and snow, while the younger is born completely normal. In the beginning, the two sisters are very close, but drift apart after an accident, while playing, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna with her powers. Anna is revived and saved by a troll king, but has no memory of Elsa's power, and Elsa is warned she needs to learn to control her powers, as they will continue to grow and become more powerful as she grows. Their parents soon both die in an enormous storm at sea, and Elsa is coroneted Queen, bringing her out of her shell. During the ceremonies, Anna falls for Hans, a visiting prince. Elsa doesn't approve of the match, and in the resulting argument, Elsa's powers are revealed, and she flees the kingdom. In exile, Elsa uses her powers to the fullest, building herself an ice castle and becoming the Snow Queen. Anna then goes to retrieve her sister and end the winter, teaming up with ice salesman Kristoff, and for the kids, Olaf the snowman. The song I really liked was  &#34;Let it go&#34;, which was sung by Idina Menzel while Elsa is building her ice palace,  perfectly describes Elsa's feelings about her newfound freedom and her powers. &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34; and &#34;Fixer Upper&#34; won't become Disney classics, but they were well choreographed and helped to add to the storyline. Its funny all the way through, the kids and adults will love, and its a departure from the traditional Disney princess, especially with Elsa, who is more regal, reserved, and less adventurous than most of Disney's other princesses. Its more about time and love, rather finding your true love and rushing into marriage like most of Disney's other classics. The only complaint is that, thescript should have had more time to be explained. It seemed they were trying to push it into an hour and 30 minutes. Taking 10-20 more minutes (two hour) would have made the movie a whole lot better, but, this will still be a movie that will stand the test of time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, but I am waiting for the update! I am farther in this game on the computer than the kindle app has levels...
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Please buy the game it has 4 1/2 stars!!! So it's popular to the world. Ok, my name is Trinity Eckstein and I think this game is the best!! I'm ten and have over 40 pets. I love to draw dragons and collect legos my favorite thing is Harry Potter my whole room is Harry Potter! Ok,I'll talk about the game. The main idea is to help the monsters not get eaten by the couch boy. You collect all the monsters together to be bigger and scare the boy from eating them. Their are different types of monsters,the sleepy,regular,mind control,and magnetic. You'll learn about what they do when you get the game. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please!!!!!!! Ok!!
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|I really like this album by Avicii especially the song &#34;wake me up&#34; and a few others<br />my only complaint about it is all of his music does not have a whole lot of meaning or message its all party music an after a while it gets boring
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! I completely love it. My whole family loves the Piano Guys. We were so excited when we got their Christmas CD. Beautifully played. I cry every time during O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|all of his songs has a great message such as his one song things that stop your dreaming.<br />passenger puts a lot of thought an meaning into his songs
B007VDPMYI|5.0|What's not to like? It's George Harrison and you can't go wrong with George Harrison. One of the most interesting songwriters of the last 60 years.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I've had this before on my kindle fire and it.was.fine and I deleted it for space and instant it again but it won't let me download it ???
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Great, fast paced movie.  Wahlberg at his best.  Very enjoyable story.  I highly recommend this entertaining movie.  Don't miss it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I didn't think this trilogy would be as awesome as I was informed it would be. Turns out it was better than described.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|This is like reading a psychology war book, from David and Goliath to Irish fight towards British government. A few inspiring nugget but not as strong thesis as Gladwell 's great book like Tipping Point and Outliers.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|This is a great movie. Violent but great. I was able to get this on here the other day for 3.99 which was a steal. I like how the second disc (recut) gives the stories different chapters. And the picture quality is beautiful.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|This is not a great literary tour de force. It is simply the most exciting, eye-opening book I have read in quite some time. It is the story of a unique phenomenon told simply, clearly and factually. Any nit-picking imperfections are not worth mentioning, they pale into insignificance as you read the story.<br />Read it!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp's career ends on a high note. VF's final book was as good as any he ever did. RIP.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This book is a cold case with Harry Bosch as the lead detective. It takes place during the famous riots in LA. As usual Michael Connelly does a good job of developing the characters and their interesting stories.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Heard their music by accident on Pandora and bought all three albums. Each album is absolutely amazing!!!  I have been recommending to anyone who will listen :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next book. I love this series and will read as many books as the author wants risk write
B002DXU548|5.0|Masterful. Mayer Hawthorne presents his own take of  Blue-eyed soul infused with the Motown heritage. I look forward to future additions to his pay list.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful story, a beautiful tale of the Holocaust, and the common people just trying to do what is right.  This is a great work of art!
B00FXMECS6|5.0|This  one is even funnier than the first. Watch John M's face, he makes you laugh even if the scene isn't supposed to be funny.  Can't wait for #3
B000SFD21Q|5.0|Very good reading about the ability to understand the connection between the mind and muscle in past and present. The case studies for depression is particularly intriguing and any reader will learn something.
B00E7RZEI0|1.0|This app was fun for about 30 minutes and then it got boring. Not much of a puzzle and every level is only slightly different than the last.
0739319175|4.0|Long and sometimes creepy but I love the way Dan Brown writes. It was definitely hard to stop reading.The ending wasn't the best on this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|An excellent game. As mentioned by others, if you're a Mist fan you'll love this game. I hope more are on the way.
1881273873|4.0|Everyone should read the Love languages books. Great insight. Relationships of all kinds benefit from the advice given. So simple and logical
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Great game!! I do wish it were easier to make money especially with everything being so pricey. And too, I don't have FB which is very frustrating. You shouldn't have to have it
0307887960|4.0|It works! You will either like the diet or hate it but I tried it and feel great. Complete for the entire dieting period.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a grim, beautifully written book about a near unfathomable culture.  The characters drawn are brilliant.  Truly great read.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I had never played this with cards, but the tutorial in the Android version makes it very easy to understand and play. You take turns with each person or computer player placing tiles on the board to connect land and roads while placing people on tiles with these features as well as farms and cloisters to earn points. There is both strategy and luck involved, making this a great board game.<br />The AI players were challenging and encouraged me to think ahead a few turns to decide when to place a &#34;follower&#34; on the tile to score points. The computer tells you where legal turns can be made, so it does not take long to be able to pick up the game.<br /><br />I did not see any intrusive permissions and it plays well, whether with friends or alone. Overall, a great addition to my Kindle Fire HD!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Ummmm- My husband told me to read this because he reads a lot of his books .and likes them,  so I decided to read one.  I read his latest Sycamore Row (Never read this author before).  It started out with  man who did the unthinkable and back tracked to all the characters involved in this situation including himself.(Make sure you keep track of all the characters because they all come into play throughout and their is quite of few). You people decide!!!!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|With owning a vita this is a must for all Persona & RPG fans. Great Story and a awesome feel versus other RPGs out there on the market 5/5
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Doesn't get much better than The Piano Guys. LOVE THEIR MUSIC. Won't disappoint. Beautiful! All of their music is a masterpeice. And their Christmas album is no exception!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This application is both simple and challenging with good graphics. I also love how the game doesn't nickle and dime you for each hint. Once you buy a hint, it's yours for as many times in that level as you want to use it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very easy to use app.  Very intuitive.  Of course the Kindle display is awesome so photos look very nice.  Easy to navigate.
0545265355|5.0|Best series I have read in a long time.  At little sad at times but it was a good read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have done 3 of the exercises and everyone was a success.  She is a woman after my own heart.  I need people like Pam in my life to remind me I am not crazy.  My vision for &#34;health for billions&#34; will become a reality, thanks to books like Pam's.  The person who recommended it to me said, &#34;I think you'll like this book.  She is Quackey like you.&#34;  Thank you Pam.  Did I mention how very simple the concepts are?  Maybe that is why more people are not aware.  Wonderfully simple
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|works great on kindle fire. fun graphics. good range of skill levels. good way to pass some time. could use a bit more variety like changing background colors between sets.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have this app on my phone. so glad I can now play it on my kindle.  sometimes it is hard to connect but not sure if its the app or me...lol
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This is a great movie about love, not lesbian love but just love (there is no difference between the love gay and straight people feel). As was said in Cabaret, who knows where the heart will lead us? There is a lot of sex in the movie, some of it over done, but not porn. More a gentle exploring of the physical aspect of a complete relationship that started with sex and bloomed into a loving, caring relationship, as often happens with any couple. The room is dark but then the lighting in the room came from one end table lamp and the bathroom light. I think the music is great, but too loud in some places. Jocelyn Pook wrote the music for the movie. I thought it so good I bought the only CD I could find of it from Spain for $21. As someone else said, &#34;The movie wouldnt be as half as good without the soundtrack.&#34; The often repeated &#34;Loving Strangers&#34; by Russian Red (Lourdes Hernández) fits so well with the movie and Jocelyn Pook's soundtrack you would think both artists collaborated on their music for this film.<br /><br />If you are looking for a satisfying relationship story that explores both the emotional and physical aspects of a true relationship where love wins in the end, this is for you.
159562015X|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning more about themselves.<br />Great compliment to Meyers-Briggs, but more details.<br />Short chapters.<br />Take the &#34;quiz / assessment' BEFORE reading the book.
B00GNL251C|2.0|Very Boring movie.  I was expecting an action packed martial arts movie. The few short fight scenes were unclear and fake.<br /><br />I am a hardcore martial arts movie fan and this movie did not deliver.<br /><br />I wish I can get my money back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My four year old son loves it!! Its perfect to play in the car on road trips or at home on a lazy weekend
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan early on makes clear that the gospels are not histories - that their writers had no intention of recording historical events.  &#34;The readers of Luke's gospel, like most people in the ancient world, did not make a sharp distinction between myth and reality...&#34; He then bases all his Jesus biography on these same gospels.  This is a work of imagination, not history.  No footnotes or endnotes are provided.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I'm glad to be living in 'The Golden Age of Historical Writing'.  I'm also glad to have found Lynne Olson, a writer whose body of work focuses primarily on the tumultuous first half of the 20th Century, and who brings to life in depth and with wonderful clarity the stories behind the motivations, personalities and events which formed the world we live in today.<br /><br />Those Angry Days is an outstanding achievement which paints a rich tapestry of the fractured political environment of the United States in the years leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and how terribly close our country came to facing the Axis powers alone.<br /><br />FDR's political maneuvering and personal indecision are described in a way which provides an understanding of the basis for conspiracy theorists who in later years attempted to place personal blame on Roosevelt for the loss of thousands of lives in that attack.  Although the book does not specifically address this issue, an understanding of the history of the events, the discussions held and passions and emotions of the principals involved at the time as contained in the book provide insights into how these theories evolved.<br /><br />Charles Lindbergh's admiration of the surface 'accomplishments' of the Third Reich (and perhaps even darker, his implied belief in the horribly flawed Nazi genetic philosophies), his participation in the America First movement and active work in opposition to U.S. preparations for war are covered in a fair and balanced way, to include acknowledgement of his wife's (Anne Morrow) dilemma in balancing support for her husband against her true instincts.  Her personal sacrifices and ultimately abrogation of her principles make her truly a tragic figure in the context of her times.<br /><br />As a historical writer, Lynne Olson stands with the likes of William McCullough, Rick Atkinson, Stephen Ambrose, Barbara Tuchman, Doris Kearns Goodwin and others who can assemble a rich tableau of understanding of why we are where we are.
0525478817|3.0|I have been a John Green fan for years, and I did enjoy this book, but there was something about it that did not feel sincere. It was well written and a very good story. I enjoyed it very much, but it felt like it was written with the intention to be something instead of just &#34;being&#34; something, if that makes sense. It felt a little forced in parts, but overall it was enjoyable. Definitely not Green's best novel, in my opinion, but still good nonetheless.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was so great and not at all what we expected. This is a great series of movies to watch with the family.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're getting this, you already know how awesome it is. It's Whedon at his very best. It's the greatest space western in the Verse. Just get it already!

B00F8KIJ2I|3.0|I have been an Avril fan since her debut album, &#34;Let Go.&#34; It was a brilliant debut from an up and coming superstar. Her sophmore effort, &#34;Under My Skin&#34; was again a great album that showed depth and maturity. Unfortunately, from there the albums have gone into a downward spiral and this self-titled album continues that spiral. OK, the songs are not the worst she's done. In fact, there are some very good songs (17, Hello Heatache and Sippin' On Sunshine to name a few) but my problem is that first, all of her CDs are beginning to sound exactly alike (I hear &#34;Girlfriend&#34; in many of the tracks) and they seem to be getting more juvenile. Avril is a few years away from 30 yet her music is sounding more high school. I have no issues either with language in songs and am a big fan of quite a few artists who have explicit lyrics in their songs...but with them, the language often makes sense. With Avril it just seems tossed in for good measure. While listening to this CD, I would be into the song and then just a string of expletives that did nothing but detract from the song. Come on Avril. We know you are fully aware of how to swear...we get it...it's been going on a lot for three albums now. Remember, as you get older write some lyrics for adults that have great hooks and good lyrics instead of writing songs for disgruntled teenagers. I keep giving Avril a shot with each new release but my patience is wearing thin. I want the Avril who released good music with the first two albums and not this Avril. Hopefully she will finally get the message.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Not all stories end with the coined phrase happily ever after. Some travel through dark forests and defeat evil witches, others tear apart loved ones for emotional turmoil. No matter the ending, all have to begin somewhere, once upon a time…<br /><br />With the whole of Storybrooke awakened from the effects from evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrila) and her powerful curse, its people are scrambling to reunite with loved ones, in the process rediscovering who they really are. No one is happier to be reunited than the Charmings – Snow (Ginnifer Goodwin) finally knows that her daughter is Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and she isn’t about to let anything tear them apart again. When a twist of fate sends Emma and Snow falling through a magical portal opened by Regina, David (Josh Dallas) loses his wife and daughter all over again – it’s a separation he wouldn’t be prepared to settle for were it not for Henry (Jarred Gilmore), whose own needs outweigh David’s desire to put aside all rational thought and go to any means necessary to find Snow again.<br /><br />On the other side of the portal is a portion of The Enchanted Forrest that was not destroyed by Regina’s evil. There, Princess Aurora (Sarah Bolger) has just been found and awakened by Prince Phillip (Julian Morris) who, along with Mulan (Jamie Chung) has been fighting off demons for years just to find Aurora and see her safely returned back to the only sect of people left who’ve survived these many years protected from the only threat that is left – Cora (Barbara Hershey). When a sacrifice is demanded, life is lost and Emma, Snow and Company discover that Henry and Aurora’s fates are intertwined – and Emma may have to trust their safe passage back to Storybrooke to a man (ColinO'Donoghue) with a twinkle in his eye, something that does not come easily to the woman who has already had her heart broken...<br /><br />After two years of being a sold-out Oncer, I’m still not sure what it is that I love most about this show. It’s not the (dialogued) script or special effects, which then leaves the story arcs, characters, costumes and settings. All of those elements are comingled in one of the most sparkling (small screen) cinematic packages that any of us have or will be likely to run across in a while. ABC developed a – I think this is safe to say – brilliant concept when this foray into the fairy tale land first teased viewers with its magic. Where they’ve failed is in the scripting – if possible, I think the dialogue has gotten more sappy that usual. Nearing the halfway point of season two, I would be lying if not admitting that the show slowly but effectively got stronger in its intricacies. By the time we reached the breaking point of Rumplestiltskin obvious improvement was there, however week-after-week, episode-after-episode surprised me how “bad” the special effects were. Even on the small-screen and given all of the technology at the fingertips of the people behind-the-scenes, I’m amazed that there isn’t more credulity to the imagery in fairy-tale land.<br /><br />I think what keeps me coming back is the clever interpretation of the famous fairytale sagas. The writer’s intertwine the fates of character’s you’d never imagine would have connections and takes our dim, safe perspective of these iconic names and challenges our ideas of them. If ever you thought you knew these personalities (as Disney would have us know them!), you may find that turned upside down. Some newbies crop up in season two (Aurora, Captain Hook, Mulan and more!) plus we catch up with old favorites such as Ruby (Meghan Ory), Belle (Emilie De Ravin) or the Seven Dwarves. Within these characters is where the heart and soul of this show is. Of course, a select number of them turn out to be evil villains but what’s most interesting is they all have a “trigger” that could resurrect them back to their former selves – all of them once had goodness in their hearts and instead of embracing that, they’ve chosen evil over goodness. Regina cracks ever so slightly whenever she’s confronted by Snow’s kindness; Rumple keeps Belle at a distance because she could be the catalyst that turns his heart backwards. These personalities (or rather the good guys) is what ensures my return. Also making fun guest spots are Lesley Nicol and Annabeth Gish.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the costumes are a flaw. the present-day ensembles are way better than the past; in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret and Belle have an adorable vintage-vibe going on and in the past the girl’s dress looks “cheap” (unless they’re having adventures – in that case, everyone does look pretty cool). Season two does “up” its concepts and the “bigness” of its storytelling. There are some fabulous twists and the stories constantly keep us on our guard, never knowing if the appearance of a new character will turn out good or bad. Because of this, for anyone who may be contemplating watching this series, you’d be best to watch it in its proper order as there are dozens of trails that intersect. This season forces enemies to work together and also takes some risks while working hard to flesh out the main cast of characters. If you like productions that are unusual and full of fairytale throwbacks, then you’re missing some unique fun by not watching this show. I may have complaints about it and feel cheated out of some things that writer’s don’t push harder to perfect and captivate, however I’m not about to give up because all of the Storybrooke stories are actually quite good. I know I’m ready to delve into its version of mermaids and Neverland. How about you?rts and instead of embracing that, they’ve chosen evil over goodness.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|I always love dragons and mystical stories. Always fans of Lord of the Rings.love fairy tales story with good ending.
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|These looms are the \\"it\\" gift of the season for tween girls. Lots of brand options for this item out there, but this one is study, comes with lots of bands and jewels for many bracelet style options. Heads up, lots of small bands, beads and sparklies. Might want to purchase a storage box with compartments to go along with this to keep down the clutter.
B00G922EA2|3.0|I normally enjoy hidden object games but this really isn't a hidden object game. It has a lot of puzzles but they are not very clear even on casual mode. On the whole it is an ok game but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.

B00AERRKHA|5.0|A great read from Lois, as usual. A funny story told with a lot of humor and attention to detail. And it is nice to see the character Ivan developed, who turns out to be pretty lucky and not really the idiot he has alwsys been maligned to be. Hope to see more of the Vorkosigan Saga.

There is so much in the book, on the second reading picked up more details.  the images ran riot in my head, I believe a movie is being made???  If so, I hope it lives up to my expectations.

1402581386|4.0|Lindsay may not be the greatest stylist of thriller/detective fiction (he isn't), but he has found a character and situation of enduring interest and seeing how the original varies from the popular cable TV show and began its run of successful novels is more than enough reason to want this generally fine reading in your library.

B005HED11Y|5.0|Three words....Kirk and Spock. The pilot show I never saw. The  opening from Gene Roddenberry is worth the price of the series...
B0043X1FL8|5.0|This dramatic film is based around the book Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote about his work with Encephalitis lethargica and the persons who were affected by it just after WWI. “Frozen in time”, countless men and women were assumed brain dead and hopeless individuals until 1969 when Dr. Sacks gave them the experimental, Parkinson’s symptoms specific drug at the time, L-DOPA. After administering it there was an astronomical affect that took place; the frozen men and women woke up.<br />  With Robin Williams background of films made up mainly of comedy, one wouldn’t think a drama would suit him, however, this is one of his most underrated acting performances. He delivers the role of Dr. Malcom Sayer extremely well by capturing the essence of the doctor to which he was based off of, an introverted loner who was admittedly “not good with people,” yet an outstanding research neurologist.<br /> Robert DeNiro is just as fantastic as Leonard Lowe, a man who was affected by Encephalitis lethargica thirty years prior. This film takes you through him growing up emotionally and psychologically into the man his body grew to be while he was in a catonic state. It takes you to experience his excitement, his frustrations, his first love, and his sadness, as if you were reliving life through Leonard. “People have forgotten what life is all about. They've forgotten what it is to be alive. They need to be reminded. They need to be reminded of what they have and what they can lose. What I feel is the joy of life, the gift of life, the freedom of life, the wonderment of life!” –Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro)<br /> This one of a kind film tugs relentlessly at your heartstrings, and you will be wondering increasingly who is chopping onions right under your nose with the roller coaster of emotions it will take you through.  It will leave you exhausted with mascara running black rivers down your face, with hundreds of wadded up tissues surrounding you and the inability to speak without realizing the accidental moral of the film. “The human spirit is more powerful than any drug - and THAT is what needs to be nourished: with work, play, friendship, family. THESE are the things that matter. This is what we'd forgotten - the simplest things” – Dr. Sayer (Robin Williams).
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoy playing Bubble Blaze. It's interesting and challenging. I like the graphics. The little flying dragons are a little annoying.
0801896940|5.0|This is the ultimate pedagogical text for undergraduate level introduction to Noether's Theorem. The author masterfully makes connections that allow students learning the subject for the first time to digest the information in a constructive manner.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Awesome form factor, and the design with the built in micro USB is awesome.  Not having to carry around an extra USB cable is great.  Only drawback is that it would be great if the outputs were rated for a higher amperage.  Even if its just one of them offering 2.1a would be great. Other than that though, love the product!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love The Piano Guys and couldn't wait for the release of this CD, and I was in no way disappointed. This CD is amazing! They perform beautifully, and this CD is filled with brilliantly arranged Christmas tunes as well as two original compositions. I never fail to be amazed at their talent both with their respective instruments and also in their arrangements. The combination of Carol of the Bells with God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is sheer genius. Their version of O Come O Come Emmanuel is one of my personal favorites for its beauty, and their rendition of We Three Kings is another for how catchy it is!<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this for anyone who likes Christmas music, instrumental music, cello music, piano music, classical music...heck, let's just say for anyone who likes good music! It makes a great gift too; I found out the other day that a good friend of mine and I both purchased this for each other for Christmas. What a laugh! Anyway, definitely purchase this CD (and go check out their other albums, too!)
B000IDEORY|4.0|This classic and enjoyable movie, will stay in your thoughts way after the unbelievable and happy ending. I highly recommend it!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The best of the best, blu-ray DVD clarity brought out more detail in the films than I've ever seen before.  Add the suspense and excellent directing, which makes this set a must have for every science fiction/&#34;Alien&#34; film-buff.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|They did a nice job staying true to the book, but thought some of the dialogue and a couple of scenes were directed at modern kids.  Great scenery, but not quite as good of cinematography as was done in Lord of the Rings trilogy.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|***spoiler alert***<br />I cant believe that Roth just let the series end like that. After all the effort that was put into these books and all the fan base that was built up in the first 2 books, this is a total disappointment and one of the biggest let downs I have ever experienced from a book. Main characters were killed off left and right, and for the grand finale, Tris dies basically for nothing, and the reader is left with emptiness… not even close to a true conclusion to the trilogy. All the &#34;bad guys&#34; live on with no repercussions, and four is left with nothing to live for. I was honestly wishing he would kill himself or AT LEAST erase his memory because of how depressing the whole situation was. I am usully big on rereading books, but I can guarantee that I will never be picking up this trilogy again, and definitely not be seeing that movie that movie that I was so excited about just yesterday. Overall just a terrible read that I would never recommend.<br />Sincerely,<br />Disappointed (former) fan

0062215507|5.0|This book is awesome! It is a must have for all Harry Potter fans. The pictures are incredible and the text is worth reading. It comes with a lot of cool things like a Yule Ball invitation, a map, and lots of extras. It is worth the money!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Ok, I get this email from Amazon before it even shipped to me, lucky I have seen the movie before, otherwise, how can I rate something I haven't even received yet?<br />The movie, its a great movie.  For those who don't know, its a story about young children who are forced by their president to be reaped into an arena to fight for the death.  A young girls name was drawn and her sister volenteers to take her space.  She then goes into the games, falls in &#34;love&#34; with the other tribute boy from her district and to make a statement, they decide they were going to die together at the same time, so no one wins the hunger games, what happens next makes the next movie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Exciting action adventure with a good plot.  Good special effects, of course, but nothing too gruesome.  Happy ending.  Just what a movie should be, in my opinion.
B002RXMG00|3.0|A classic that I had to let my daughter watch. So many other movies and shows reference this movie, it is almost required watching for any movie fan.
B000FBJG04|4.0|This is a great history of one of the most important regiments of WWII. Parts of the book are fast-paced and exciting, and parts are slow and dull. It's just like war, I guess.
B00CHILW64|3.0|We rented this movie with high expectations, but in the end it was slightly disappointing.  It's hard to explain why, but I think part of it had to do with the fact that we have all seen lots of actual footage of the 2004 tsunami, and the film really did not seem to portray it very accurately (in the film the wave hit with MUCH greater force than any of the actual news videos I have seen).  Because the &#34;fake&#34; tsunami footage didn't match the way the &#34;real&#34; thing looked, my immediate reaction was &#34;Oh, that's fake...&#34; which made it harder to really get into the movie.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad film, but it's just not as compelling as it could have been.
1781162646|5.0|Devlin Jones (\\"Dev\\" or \\"Jonesy\\"), now a writer in his sixties, reminisces about the summer of 1973 when he decided to take a year off from his college studies and take a job as a carny in a North Carolina amusement park, 700 miles from his home town of Durham, New Hampshire.  This is basically the plot of the newest novel by Stephen King.  But whatever preconceptions the reader might have about a book by this most prolific and best-selling novelist, be prepared to set them aside; I know I had to!  And I mean that in the best way possible.<br /><br />The tale opens in 1973, when the protagonist was a self-proclaimed 21-year-old virgin.  He had just had his heart broken by his first love, and his life suddenly becomes one wholly inhabited by carny workers, as well as a `boy and a woman and their dog.'  Most of the summer hires are \\"college students willing to work for peanuts.\\"  There is a backstory involving a dead girl killed in the amusement park years before, and four similar murders in Georgia and the Carolinas, all of young girls.  Of course, there is also the ghost in the funhouse.  Towards the end, things turn suddenly darker on, of course, an unforgettable \\"dark and stormy night.\\"<br /><br />The novel is utterly absorbing, fast-reading, and very moving.  As always, Hard Case Crime has done a wonderful job of bringing us a book that may seem a throw-back to a simpler time.  And I mean that in the best way possible as well.  The novel is simply terrific, and highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game and cant believe its on kindle! :)<br /> but gets little boring after a while. update faster please! I don't have enough ores to make anything! also hard to find ores. please have these following updates! infinite world, natural caves, inchanting/levels, food bar, endermen, breeding, redstone stuff, and somehow sprint!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a fun game, you don't have to pay for unless you want to, you can play for hours and get addicted.
B00DJYK9ZU|2.0|I thought from all the hype that this was a &#34;HOT&#34; group. I liked the HO Hey song and was hoping it the album contained more songs that I liked. However, most of the songs sound the same. The lead vocalist sounds irritating after a while. I'm glad that many people like them, but I wish I had paid more attention and previewed the songs. Recording sounds like they did it in a garage.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|His voice is very unique.  I LOVE this CD.  And what a great value.  His duets are the bomb.  It's a beautiful Christmas song collection.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|I liked the character study in this movie and a storyline that is credible and entertaining. It feels almost like a family movie and provides a sense of contentment at the end
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|JT hit on the head with this CD.  He was also great on Jimmy Fallon (which was the primary reason I bought it).
B00FGEO9NE|5.0|I wait for DVD releases, and when I come across personal vendetta's and childish writings/reviews, those reviews invalidate themselves. Someone telling me they are mentally ill, but winning is pointless in this platform, unless the goal is to move the focus to the braggart them selves. If you're going to take the time to post a public review, take the time to spell check it. I have not watched so much as one episode of season 3, so my star rating is to offset at least two people who are dismantling an entire season due to slow, or not personally preferred episodes. I will follow up after I've watched the ENTIRE season series.

6305428271|5.0|very good movie even though it was very old back in the day still like to watch it.<br />very real like if you ever lived in the inner city you can relate
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very much not my typical style or genre of reading material but I liked it.  Skipped through the graphic descriptions of attacks, and the commentary on political and social reactions to a global catastrophe are worth reading and thinking about.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|works great most of the time but sometimes it just wont know the song quick enough and you have to have the music semi loud
0446573027|4.0|I like to listen to these David Baldacci books in the car.  His writing style is clean and clear, easy to follow, although he can mess it up with a bunch of extraneous characters.  Our protangonist is US Army criminal investigator John Puller.  He has a father and brother in the Army, the father a senile general and the brother in military prison for crimes that are likely covered in another book. Puller is the classic soldier hero, has been decorated on the battlefield, is trained and skilled in all areas of combat and investigation, has a heart of gold, can instantly read anyone, and follows the regulations closely, especially the part about fraternizing with officers while on duty.<br /><br />We start off with four brutal murders in a West Virginia coal town, soon followed by more.  Puller is called in because the first victims were a military family.  He soon joins forces with the local cop, who is a hard-working young lady, well-liked and well-known, especially since her sister is married to the local coal baron.  Next it turns out that not only is coal mining hazardous, there are collateral concerns including forgotten nuclear waste, boulders raining down on cars, biker gangs occupying forgotten firehouses, drug sellers occupying abandoned homes, coal barons with plans to take over more than just West Virginia, and the earlier mentioned string of murders.<br /><br />Fortunately Puller never lets his guard down and survives numerous attempts on his life, including fights with local toughs. The criminal trail leads back to Washington where Puller gains some allies, although it turns out you can't trust everyone who works for Uncle Sam.  At the end Puller figures out the plot and engages his imprisoned brother to foil it.<br /><br />The story starts out well, paints a stunning picture of mayhem in a small town, and ends strong with some plot twists that Baldacci's lesser rivals wish they had throught of first.  In between we get sidetracked at times with too manyspurned love interests, local characters, and argumentative and depressed old-timers.

B00B9PJ4TI|2.0|the shoe had a small defect at the lace guide and i normally wear 13 but they were much to large.
031623480X|2.0|The author was fixated on glutin and linked most of our health problems to a high carbohydrate diet. Other books show similar results for high protein/fat diets. The bottom line is one diet does not fit all!<br /><br />The other problem there were several errors regarding physiology. For example, the brain can only use glucose for energy and not ketones as stated by the author.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Much better than season 3. The storyline is a faster pace than the soap-opera laden previous season. I'm very impressed with the soundtrack as well, the music adds an incredible layer to the shows not unlike the old CSI shows. I find myself looking up the music after each episode.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I wish there were ways to earn more tokens other than buying our waiting an hour for a scratch off but the game is fun
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I am not a gamer but think this game is fun and challenging. Great graphics and music too, it adds to the mystical theme!
0374203032|4.0|Michael Sandel's &#34;What Money Can't Buy&#34; is a thought provoking look at the various ways the nature of a free market came become insidious. Sandel’s examples demonstrate a loss in true value of a good or market by underachieving and/or possessing an indirect cost intrinsic and moral cost to society. I found Sandel’s examples varied to encapsulate issues likely to be morally significant to people from all incomes and backgrounds.<br /><br />After reading Sandel I engaged in many discussions with friends and family because there was always several points offered that I felt would be of interest regardless of audience. For example, Sandel demonstrates how the process of paying a child to get good grades can subsequently, be a form of “bribery” that tends to make children less likely to develop an attitude of good study habits without further intrinsic incentive.<br /><br />In addition, Sandel also demonstrated points that affect all Americans, such as, lobbyists paying homeless to stand in line at congressional hearings to later switch places ensuring that lobbyists always had front row seating but also could block the queue from competing voices such as environmentalist groups.<br /><br />Sandel's book is essential for economists and highly recommended to anyone looking for an intriguing read that has a refreshing moral and economic perspective on issues you probably didn’t know exist but will want to know!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep keeps on coming!<br />There was no putting it down!<br /><br />You out did yourself Mr. KING!<br />  What a read!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works great, battery lasts all week before I have to charge it. Great audio quality as well. Would definitely recommend!
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book was good. The story was interesting but keeping up with everyone that wanted to kill Sookie was confusing at times. It held my interest. Overall I enjoyed the book.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|This movie has it all. Action. Love. Story. Characters that pull you into the movie. The fact that they took so much time on Action effects alone makes this movie.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Kids should not be watching this let alone reading this book. This was marketed all wrong. PARENTS SHOULD READ THE BOOK FIRST!
B0026P3G12|5.0|A strong instrument in therapy with music. It makes you feel relaxed and confident. I would listen to it for hours and hours.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, interesting game that improves your hand eye coordination.  Learning the levels and how to clear them has been quite the challenge, but I like it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It is just like the PC version of it(non 1.2) I love it :)) so much nostalgia I love it
1400052181|5.0|Have read it twice.  It's an important well written book that provides us information about a small but incredibly vital part of scientific history while telling the story of a black family and their trials and tribulations.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Never ever can you tire of this timeless classic Christmas movie for all ages to enjoy over and over again and again!!!!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors and this is one of his best books.  Although I was aware of much of what happened in 1927,<br />Bryson supplies so much extra illuminating detail that I really learned a lot.  He has the knack of writing in a fascinating and refreshing way.  Although each chapter discusses a separate event, he shows how they are often linked together.  All in all a enjoyable, informative and entertaining read.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Best described as: tedious. Save yourself some time. Watch something else. It was so laborious, the minimal eye candy aspect of it couldn't make up for it's plodding slow dullness.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This was a great app for my dayly basis. Hallways in schools, in my house and really everywhere. YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very engaging book - at first I didn't like some of the things in the ending, but the more I thought about it it wasn't a bad way to end the book.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I had a GPS from a competitor but prefer the range finder as it is more accurate on distance and I do not have to wonder what the error differential is.  My only complaint, and why I am not assigning this 5 stars is that my model runs the battery down when not in use.  I THINK I heard this sometimes happens with the Bushnells but in my case, whenever I am not using it, I have to take the battery out.  However, since being able to laser various points on the course to help determine the club to play, my scores have definitely gone down.
B00DWOUY3Y|4.0|I started with the first opera in the set, a 1935 performance of Otello with Lawrence Tibbett as Iago and Giovanni Martinelli as Otello.  From the first chords, I blurted out, &#34;Oh, no!&#34; as the quality of the sound was so substandard.  Then Martinelli's passion came through, and I smiled and chortled, &#34;Oh, yes!&#34;  Something about these live performances with dream casts - just spectacular.  Leonard Warren's Falstaff was a revelation to me.  A young Richard Tucker as Alvaro in Forza del Destino was almost as exciting as a young Pavarottie.  Only caveat thus far - Leonie Rysanek, whom I have loved - sounded shrill in Macbeth.  And Zinka Milanov who in my opinion was the most overrated singer of all time was mediocre in Forza, especially compared to a recording a few years later that started Tucker again as Alvara and Leontyne Price as Leonara - Yum!
B000FC13E0|3.0|The premise was very creative and original. That and the fact that the writing was so good made the first half a real page turner. The second half of the book was just typical action movie stuff, with the ending having the good guys flying away in a helicopter as the bad guy headquarters blows up in the distance. The originality  and interesting twists and turns of the first half simply weren't there.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|What would it be like to go back to 1864 in a time machine and see Abraham Lincoln alive?  Thanks to Steven Spielberg's astounding masterpiece, I think I know.  Not only do I think this movie deserved the Academy Award for best picture, I think it will stand the test of time and be among the top 20 ever.  Yes, the supporting cast is strong.  David Straithern nails Seward, and yes Daniel Day Lewis' channeling Lincoln himself is one of the great performances ever, but even little touches, thanks to Tony Kushner's screenplay, like the soldiers, white and black, who have instinctively memorized parts of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, as if the power of the words simply seeped into their souls, one great piece of cinematic art after another.<br />Some people have complained that the extras on the Bluray were skimpy, but I found them to be welcome additions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is fabulous. I was captivated for two days as I read each one. Exciting and thought provoking. Loved each one!
B00DSGT8TW|4.0|I found this album (I purchased the vinyl) to be very good from start to finish. Now don't get me wrong I love the more electric stuff but as a nice change of pace this is GREAT. But if your a MSP fan you knew this album was coming so anyone who doesn't like it or says it's not a god disc will hopefully be ready for the next one....as for me I found the songs great for just sitting and listening almost like a book is being read to you and with alot of great guests on board ( Cate Le Bon to name 1) very pleasing to the ear!
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|I'm a big In Flames fan so a buddy of mine told me I should check out Dark Tranquility so I bought this album. This album is great, it has that same style as In Flames but with some great electronic atmosphere alone with it.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and all the music by the Piano Guys.<br />I think that &#34;Carol of the Bells&#34; is my all time Favorite but the new &#34;Angels We Have Heard on High&#34; is coming in a very close second.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|An interesting game that keeps my attention.  Is not too demanding and NOBODY gets shot.  Grand kids love to play and I can be comfortable with them playing unattended.
B00006878K|5.0|Great Album with Booker T & The MG's backing up this master! So many classic songs and as far as I can tell.. recorded live!
0307719774|5.0|I love this journal. As some others have said, it can be a little hard to write in at times. But that really hasn't been an issue for me. The questions are great and vary a lot. Some are a little more deep (What would you like on your epitaph), some are quirky or funny (What's your favorite pair of shoes). I can't wait to see how my answers change over time. The amount of lines per year given have been pretty perfect. It's not meant to be a journal where you go into rich detail. It's a question and answer series, so you don't need that much room. I bought one for myself, a few others for Christmas presents. I bought this for what's on the inside, but the outside is just as beautiful. Well crafted and looks good sitting on my coffee table.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was totally surprised at how much I liked this book! I just bought it for my 28 year old son because i know he will also like it!
0393334988|5.0|This is an extraordinary personal rendition of the ordeal of this man’s life. The writing is to the point and very poignant, giving much feeling to the sufferings the author endured.<br /><br />The author had a rather sheltered life in Scotland. His descriptions of his upbringing and his infatuation with trains give stark contrast to the later events. Given his predilection for structure, the army also provided that, when he was recruited at the outbreak of war in 1939. He trained somewhat in Scotland and England – and then was shipped to India and finally Singapore in November of 1941.<br />His entire life was shattered when he was taken prisoner of war by the Japanese when Singapore surrendered in February of 1942.<br /><br />We are provided with searing portrayals of his long incarceration – the torture of himself and his comrades, his interrogations, lengthy imprisonment in small cells where silence was maintained for months at a time. The diet was minimal – several prisoners contracted diseases and died due to their weakened condition.<br /><br />The overpowering strength of this book is how the author endured after the war. As can be expected the memories never go away and he develops an enduring hatred of his captors that continually haunts his dreams. Brutality is personal and those who experience it carry the physical – and more particularly, the mental scars for life. There is always a simmering pain beneath the surface that corrodes the soul.<br /><br />I will not reveal the conclusion of the book except to say that seldom have I read of such an emotional upheaval with beautiful passages of forgiveness and reconciliation. All this occurred fifty long years after the events happened, which demonstrates that indeed life can change for the better.
1577312082|5.0|very nice. just as expected even a little better than the book I will recommend this to anyone who is thinking about purchasing something in this subject matter
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love, love Gideon !!!!! I waited o long for entwined with you that I was afraid to be disappointed but nope that didn't happen. Now the waiting is totally going to kill me but I jut hope that is worth it.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Just Plain Laugh Out Loud Funny!  I wasn't expecting it to be laugh out loud funny, but I did laugh out loud many times. The time went by so fast. I couldn't believe it was over.  I wanted it to last longer.  I see a sequel in the future.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Bothersome, repetitive ads.  Have to clear out to start a new game by going back to front page.<br />Looking for better game.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very simple and easy to use. With the bigger key's they are we clearer and makes it quick to hit them with very little error.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I loved every song on this album! It was both fun and relaxing to listen to. Whether for background music, or party music, this is a winner.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Every book he has written has been great.  I would recommend this author to anyone.  Be sure to read all of the Camel Club books as they are some of the best written.  Can't wait till he writes another one.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Excellent documentary on the sad state of orcas at Sea World.  The research and interviews were captivating.  Too bad the story is so sad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book shows how you can love someone, as little time as Hazel and Augustus loved eachother, but still feel like you've exploded with the grenade as soon as it has exploded. this book, beyond other books, has a true meaning in the heart.
B008BRC6NS|1.0|I ordered this CD set 4 times and each time the 2nd CD was blank. Was able to return it twice with the same results but 2 of the 4 times my request for return/replacement was submitted too late.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|This was a gift for my wife and she loved it. I don't have no clue why she likes it so much. She isa fan of the BSB since the beginning.
B00G922EA2|5.0|This game was entertaining. No two puzzles were the same. Game keeps you guessing. Was a bit surprised how it ended.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Super cool series for does who likes supernatural stuff, ghost, vampires, demons and angels. I enjoyed all the series very much.
B000OW77UU|5.0|In my opinion,  one of the best movies ever!  A great family movie for all ages.  My kids and my husband loved it!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Loved it! Fast paced... Funny and so romantic!! I loved Dragos & Pia... The plot was well done... Will definitely read the rest of the series!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love the Piano Guys. I agree that it's totally worthy getting the version that includes the DVD videos. Watching them make music is amazing.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this after a busy day. I love to disappear into a book. The book was entertaining to read. I looked forward to reading every night.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I loved this on the IPhone but now that it's on the kindle it should be crazy awesome. I love playing the full game on the ps3 as well, so now that I have a WBid it will make the console game so much better. I hope they keep adding new cards to collect.
B00DJ735KI|4.0|This book by Lipton is the first I have read in his area of biology. In fact, it is probably not unbelievable that I have never heard of it. It was a fascinating read by a scientist who has moved in his understanding beyone the old beliefs and knowledge of science vs religion and beyond Darwinism in the classic sense. He leaves room for the spirit and the Spirit.<br /><br />I am a Christian and a student of thelogy as well and find that this book is very suggestive and interesting. It is a little difficult to get though if you have little background in the sciences, but definitely not impossible. He as written it to help you through the process and done a fine job of it.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author &#34;John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms&#34; &#34;Wesley's Wars&#34; and &#34;To Whom it May Concern&#34;
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Wonderful to hear soulful jazz of this gravitas. Consistently interesting and engaging throughout. Knockout voice, song writing and delivery, all with an outstanding band.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy.  This is awesome! I don't ususally get hooked so quick but this did it for me.  Even good for diabetics
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I had watched bits and pieces of &#34;Despicable Me&#34; on broadcast TV with commercials, as had a couple of other members of my family, and we wanted to watch it from beginning to end without interruption, so Thanksgiving evening we decided to rent &#34;Despicable Me.&#34;  This movie is perfect for children and adults.  We had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the story line, which was funny, exciting, and very warm-hearted.  Looking forward to watching &#34;Despicable Me 2&#34; when it is available!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again John Grisham nails it!  I have read every book he's written and he always leaves me wanting more!  Great read!!
0880796863|2.0|These cards are made in China and are not the original Tarot. The colors are not the same as the original deck and in Tarot cards, the colors have meanings. I do not recommend buying these cards.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Still a few bits to work out. Obviously raw streaming seems very taxing on the device. It seems like a little software ad on would make this leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />I use it mostly to stream flash/html5 videos to my TV from my computer without having to worry about being tethered via an HDMI cable. It works well enough for that,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter is the one who eventually convinced me to download this app.. Since I have I've been able to get a lot if stuff done, and I know right where my kid is, on the couch with my tablet playing this game.. Some say I've lost my tablet, I say I've gained a clean house and happy kid.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|Very good movie It has funny parts in it but it becomes more serious as the movie goes a long. As a women it's very empowering! It's amazing what one women can do. These are issues that women are still facing unfortunately today. Glad I have it in my collection. I would like to get a copy of for my girlfriends.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Anyone who enjoys period pieces will appreciate this story. It's an interesting perspective on WWII and blends the beautiful and tragic moments seamlessly.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|I just love these people.  This continues to make me laugh.  I continue to love them.  I never want it to end!
0618680004|5.0|Must own book from one the greats! Reason and Logic at its best. Very easy to read & understand if you live in a natural/material based world. If your religious you will not like what you read if you base life on a belief instead of evidence!
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I just want to listen to this all day and night.  It's great for driving or riding or feeling or just listening.  I'm not good at describing it.  It's not like anything else.  It's just amazing.
1451666179|5.0|This book is a hilarious and poignant (I've always hated that word but it fits) glimpse into the world of a smart, funny woman who happens to be dealing with major depression. Her descriptions of the &#34;ups&#34; in her life made me laugh hysterically and her descriptions of the &#34;downs&#34; reminded me that I'm not alone (and made me want to send Brosh a big encouragement cake). If you've ever suffered from depression, there's a good chance you'll want to shout, &#34;YES! That 's it exactly!&#34; multiple times while reading. I finished the book in a weekend and couldn't stop making people read parts of it. There's a reason she has so many online readers and I can't wait to see what she does next.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love candy crush but got to a point where I couldn't go further then got bored  doing the same thing over and over and still can't get thru
0956010903|5.0|The edition is stunning and, of course, the content has been made famous by last book in the Harry Potter series....
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This movie is awesome!!  It's has a unique plot with great humor and animation.  One of my favorites this year!  if you havent seen it, you should.  Well done Dreamworks!!
B00288KNLS|3.0|The filmmaking itself is terrific, but I found the changes to the story to be a bit of a bummer.  I can understand that they wanted to make it more kid friendly, but it's really not a kid book in my opinion, so I don't understand some of the changes.  It's one of those movies you have to see simply for the magnitude of the filmmaking, but you might not appreciate the story.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My son is absolutely nuts about this movie.  I must confess I really like it too though. Great storyline, characters and humor.  The animation is also well done, and to top it all off there are some excellent music compilations to certain scenes.  Nice job Disney!!
1451648537|5.0|I've never had a book of this length hold my attention for so long.  I digested this book over the course of a month, and I was glad to have gotten it.  It really changed the way I look at myself and my work.  Excellent storytelling, humorous, and really shows Steve Jobs's humanity alongside his coldness.<br /><br />I have no interest in seeing the movie; I can't see how it could live up to this book.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I enjoy making all of the different drinks, entrees &amp; sides.  It's like owning &amp; working in your own soda shop.  It's a must get.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie was really dumb.  ***Spoiler***  In the very begining of the movie, there was a scene where Brad Pitt gets out of his car and the camera pans out and we see that there are cars jam packed bumper to bumper for miles behind his car.  Also we can see that there is barely enough room for the Cop on his motorcycle to squeeze in between cars to get to Brad to tell him to sit back in his car.  Not a second passes after Brad closes his car door does the officer on the motorcycle get hit by a MACK TRUCK going 80 miles per hr.  Ok, I just finished telling you there was barely room for a motorcycle in-between the cars that are backed up for a mile, so how exactly does a MACK truck pick up 80 mph speed and not hit any cars before hitting the cop on the bike?  C'mon man.  If you can buy that BS I guess this movie is for you.  If you have even half of a brain this should bother you.  I haven't even touched on the &#34;Zombies.&#34;  ***END of SPOILERS***<br /><br />Ok so they aren't Zombies but they are.  Explain to me how if you are an old lady that can barely walk, but if you get infected now you can run at lighting speed and jump off the sides of cars?  And I thought Sharknado was preposterous.<br /><br />Watch &#34;28 Weeks later&#34;.  A much better film.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This book is a page turner, filled with nostalgia for the South! I really feel like I am in Ford County as I read this unforgettable story- thank you John Grisham!!
B005XUC398|4.0|I gave it four stars because I enjoyed it,.The acting was great and a good story.may watch it again someday.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It's OK but I am still trying to figure out strategies to score higher.  It's fun to hear swimmers scream when they get eaten!!!!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Love Keanu Reeves and he's amazing to watch in this movie, Shia Lebouf was pretty good, and just  love Djimon Honsou, good entertainment  I definitely recommend this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very powerful story. Had me crying and laughing at the same time.. can't wait until I see how they can possibly make this a movie
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book and book series is not good at all.  It is written so incredibly poorly that it is almost unreadable.  I have an obsessive compulsive need to finish any book or book series once I start it.  Lucky for me, these books are very fast reads.<br /><br />Rice repeats ideas many times within the same page.  She doesn't trust her readers to figure out what she has already made more than obvious.  This results in a completely dumbed down story.  To add to that, I've never had such a clear glimpse of the inside of a tween's mind.  Rice goes from characters being sure of their feelings to confusion and then back to being confused and questioning their every thought.<br /><br />There are plenty of spelling and grammatical errors as well but these mistakes don't compare to the numerous reasons that make this book and book series so bad.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I keep on playing this game, but those challenges bother me sometimes. I was thinking about getting Despicable Me 2 for Christmas.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game was  fun. It loaded quickly. However, it was really easy to beat. I really like how it works with the kindle fire.
B0018M6J90|3.0|A friend recommended this movie but I thought it was not quite my cup of tea, pardon the British pun.
1451695195|5.0|Very happy with the book.  It helps me gain a higher level of spiritual happiness.  Eben Alexander is very detailed about his NDE.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Slow moving story with a very sad plot. Denzel did a masterful job but the story seemed to drag on. Good special effects.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like the YouTube apparently on kindle fire because you can download videos to your gallery and watch them without wi-fi anytime.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|Great family movie. We have family with all ages and everyone loves it. Entertaining and we learned about the ecosystem and why we need Bees!
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|This is my favorite TV series and it was a great bargain compared to store prices. Long wanted for my collection.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What is there to say.....love Downton. I'll be sad when the run is over in two years. I watch seasons 1-3 over and over and over. Just love it to pieces!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Absolutely love it totally addicted lol band banana abandons banana abandons abandons avenging ensconc<br />Wazed Maxine five four three two one zero
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys have done it again! With their singular style of Angels We Have Heard On High (1 piano - 4 hands), and the intense, grabbing beat of Carol Of The Bells (cello only), to the calm, peaceful melody of Still, Still Still, and many more, this is one Christmas album that will be played over and over again in our home. A definite favorite for years to come!!! BUY THIS ALBUM and support this wonderful group of guys and their music!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It takes to long to download but it has good graphics.It also has all kinds  of DC super heroes and villains.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love candy crush. about time they got the app. had to download a 3rd party software to download it from google play, and it constantly would freeze. With the fire/kindle version its perfection!
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|The book was exciting, funny to read, and I liked how it had everything written in crayon! I've of those books I would read over and over! Not just a small children book. very exciting. Recommend reading!!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I absolutely love these shoes! They are a very nice, comfortable material that is nice and light weight. the only bad thing about then is the bottom of the shoe begins to wear off after a little while of wearing.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Exciting, non-violent, no bad language, lots of plot twists, fast paced. Everybody in the family loved it at our house...
1451626088|5.0|Ms Gregory has again written a fine historical novel.  I have had a great interest in all the descendants of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford and the books on the Lancastrians and Yorkists are so well written to show how the cousins came into such conflicts as the War of the Roses.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|The movie's story line was far too depressing for most members of the family. It was a definite chick flick
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Awesome strategy game. I can't wait for the next update. Absolutely worth the money! I highly recommend the game Plague Inc.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|say goodbye to life as you  know it. this addicting super fun game will have you laughing crying throwing things...talking to yourself....i love it. bet you do too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the saddest and most heart wrenching book in the series. Also...my favorite! This book will make you laugh..make you cry...and make you think about human nature...
B000002QWD|5.0|I grew up with this LP of Bing Crosby and nobody does Christmas music like Bing.  This is a fantastic collection. I highly recommend it.
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Disney hit another home run with this movie soundtrack, which includes the score (on the second disc) and the performed songs plus Demi Lovato's single (on the first disc). We only saw the movie last week but my kids (aged 3 and 6) both adored the songs and left the cinema singing the little bits they could remember, and now we are listening to this selection of songs, including the beautiful &#34;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&#34;, the uplifting &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34;, the powerful anthem &#34;Let it Go&#34;, and Olaf's hilarious &#34;In Summer&#34;. Idina Menzel (predictably) kills it with her parts and Kristen Bell is impressive as well. I absolutely recommend.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys continue to do impressive and captivating things using a combination of classics, classical instruments, unusual arrangements, and even improvised instruments.  They blend pop music beats and styles, as well as homage bits to other classic Christmas Carols in this fun seasonal installment.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great Smith's product. I wish it would come with more detailed instructions on how to use it, but shipping was fast and the product was great! Thank you!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Best portable office app for Android. It can pretty much open all the current Microsoft Office documents and other open source documents without any lag. This is a must app for every Android device.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This was one of my favorite grants on Big Fish several years ago. I enjoyed replaying it on the tablet after all these years. It translated very well, with touch controls much easier to use than a mouse. I'm looking forward to the sequel, which I never got around to on PC.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game. Fast and efficient shipping. I highly recommend this to any gaming group. Games are quick so you can fit in 2 or 3 in an evening with ease and the replayability is excellent.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Even though a novel, this book was so amazing.  My mother had Alzheimer's disease and I often wondered what she was going through, did she know something was wrong (she did), and how frustrating it was for her.  This book offers amazing insights into this truly difficult disease.  I recommend it highly.
0345529057|5.0|I have read oodles of fantasy books and series and this one is one of the best. It breaks the notions of good always winning and evil always losing into a thousand shards of dragon glass. This box set is a bargain and if you like fantasy you will love ASoIaF.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These guys make some of the most beautiful and amazing music I have ever heard in my life! I would encourage everyone to listen!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Very fun game with strategy involved.  Very much worth the money. I love that you can evolve the disease. Very high replay value.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I thought this was pretty slow moving until around halfway through. But once it finally picks up it is pretty good.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />I was rooting for Connor and Tess. I dislike how things turned out with Tess.
630542828X|4.0|Movie was exactly as advertised! Seller is very easy to work with. Shipping took a little longer than I would have liked but product was perfect! Overall, a great purchase and totally worth the amount of money paid! Thanks for a very positive transaction!
B008JFURKG|5.0|I like action movies and I liked RED very much so was interested in seeing how the sequel would be. The sequel was every bit as good as the original and i enjoyed this movie very much and was glad I bought it.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|It is a great tale told by some our best actors of the time.  Very compelling drama.  Worth watching again. PS: The period clothes, cars & scenery are wonderful.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I normally do not like zombie type movies and was actually reluctant to buy this movie. I actually bought the movie to see how the 3D graphics would be and they were pretty good but not spectacular. If you like this genre then go for it!
B004MPRWJG|5.0|This book had me completely enthralled in the in-between world of Susie Salmon. It is absolutely beautiful writing. I admire Alice for her courage to transfer her experiences into this elegantly told story. I'm not the same after reading and watching both.
B005LAII0S|3.0|It been a while since I saw this movie. I thought it was okay. It is more of a &#34;chick flik&#34; and I am more a fan of action movies. It is worth seeing if you haven't seen it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I have read many Baldacci books.  This was one I simply could not stop reading.  Loved the characters and twists and turns.  It was a wonderful way to speed through an afternoon.<br /><br />Next stop:  The Hit.  Loved Will Robie he was an unexpectedly complex individual.  Lots of cold blooded rapier hits interrupted by moments of extreme humanity.  This has to be the best Baldacci I've read recently.  Can't wait to start The Hit.  I hope there will be more to come in this series.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|I like action films and this film is an aquatic transformer type movie. Lot of action with big alien creatures and monster robots controlled directly by humans. Interesting concept but predictable ending. Still much fun to watch particularly in 3D.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Always like a hidden object app that is free for kindle...keep them coming and I'll keep playing. Starts easy but definitely gets harder as you level up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter loves it, and has been playing it everyday since she got it. Her Uncle and other family members are addicted to it as well, and they are the ones that got her started with it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|In spite of some significant deviations from historical fact, none of which change the basic story, this film well-cast film is both suspenseful and exciting. It's refreshing to see Federal employees portrayed as competent professionals rather than the dupes or villains in some ridiculous conspiracy. Ben Affleck's understated performance as a CIA operative offers a rare look at the real world of overseas intelligence work, rather than the Mission Impossible fantasy world so loved by Hollywood. All in all, this is a fine film that creates a real sense of the period and a crisis that shaped America for the last decade of the Cold War.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Nowhere near finished, but so far so good. Well worth the long download time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of HO games. This one makes you think. Love it.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Turned my iPod Classic into Bluetooth with one click and now I can use my Bluetooth headphones!  It worked on my iPod Classic 7th Generation! Thank you!
B007SY3CEW|1.0|I never got it downloaded.  It took my coins, but did not download it!  How do I get it back without paying again?
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|One of the all time greatest war movies. Great story, cinematography, and acting. Along with an all star cast. Then add in the change to blu ray and the improvement in picture quality that brings. It's a no brainer. Everybody should own this.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I was able to setup my official mail using K-9. Works perfectly. The email client in Kindle 8.9 Fire HDX did not work for my official e-mail.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Srini
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is by far one of the best Sci Fi series ever made. In my opinion, Joss Wheaton made a huge mistake ending this project.  I find myself watching this series over and over. The current offerings of garbage laden with moronic commercials is just too much to bear. Netflix and Amazon Prime are the future of home entertainment.  Offerings like Firefly, and the movie sequel Serenity will see the masses leaving network television in droves. I, for one think the major networks will be bankrupt in the next 5 years. Keep em coming Amazon!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like the second book even better than the first book. I can't wait to see the movie and read the third book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is one off the best series ever. Period.The cast is superb on every level from minor to major characters. No sets, but an astounding location. This is a 'do not miss.'
B005UT29Z0|3.0|Sort of whitewashes/justifies reprehensible behavior. Attempts to humanize the monsters that destroyed our justice system along with what was left of our financial system...good from a raw entertainment point of view, excellent performances by some very competent actors.<br /><br />Takes 'fiction' to a whole new level!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Watch this before you watch Iron Man 3 and Thor...it will also keep you in the loop on what happens on Agents of Shield.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Please YouTube and NetFlex great. Would give it 5 stars if I can play my own video from my iPhone.
B005HED11Y|4.0|It is a classic! Special effects are funny sometimes and it is pretty hokey, but it is entertaining.  I remember watching it when I was a kid, but really don't remember specific episodes.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Concisely written, no nonsense. If you are serious about reclaiming your creativity and are willing to change your thinking and behaviors, this book will give you the road map.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really hated that this was end...I definitely will keep reading Hugh Howey' s books. I don't like giving out spoiler reviews, so all I will say is \\"READ THIS SERIES!\\" Just so you know...I am an avid reader and mainly read romances. I joined a book club to expand my fiction reading. This series was chosen. Now I have a new type of books to read...
B000JMKSE2|4.0|It is really interesting to think of the long tail as the maybe biggest advantage of e-com, People tend to think of competitive prices as the biggest advantage, while I believe that the possibility to have huge #products &#34;in stock&#34; may well be as important
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love these books.  A very good story line. Exceptional read. Though not for everyone but I certainly enjoyed them.Excellent! Great!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best! The novel has a level of complexity I have not seen from Grisham for awhile. Great story!
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|Although a bit cliched in parts, the story translated well from children's book to a story adults could relate to. The cinematography was spectacular, and the beauty of the English countryside shone through. A bit of 'suspend disbelief' was necessary, yet it did work for this viewer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally addictive levels vary from easy to hard and get harder the more you play. I am stuck on level 167 and am now in rehab playing Papa Pear Saga
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|I'm not much of a music critic, my radio is most often tuned to talk.  Ms. Yelich-O'Connor just seems to have written some very honest songs.  The songs are a bit offbeat, not love songs, not even a lot of anger or angst.  She sings about her life and friends and it is surprisingly sweet.  After some time in the celebrity world she will probably change, but for now I will enjoy this effort.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These work good enough. DONT over tighten them. It makes removing wires a snap. They fit snug in my yamaha receiver.
B00G70JQZC|2.0|Just awful. Hugh Jackman takes his shirt off, makes tough guy faces, fights ninjas, takes his shirt off, makes existential tough guy faces, fights more ninjas, takes his shirt off and gets down to business with a stick insect that doubles as a love interest. The effects are of the highest caliber but its all in the service of nothing special.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|For it's time, it looked at some unspoken rules, issues, taboos, and the social structure of the british patriarchy. A good trip down memory lane to watching with my mum while growing up.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Hard enough to be a challenge fun to play y e t not to hard for fifty something to be able to play
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Frutratrating glitches causes you to lose all progress. Happened twice in two days after playing for a substantial amount of time. Deleted from my kindle!!!!!!!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Dredd NEVER takes his helmet off!  Unlike Stallone, thats the way its suppose to be!  Urban is a grim , humorless dredd much more faithful to the spirit of the comics.<br /><br />the story is interesting and it wastes no time with origins, just action!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Downloaded this for my grandson and he really enjoyed playing with it.  Every time I visit I bring it out and he and my granddaughter really enjoy it.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Kept me very interested and wanting more. Challenged my thinking but wasn't over the top difficult. Want more like it! Wish it was longer and had more levels.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Great Calendar and I like having it available to me when I want to check on a date or make a note.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Oh so Creepy!  The rubber man is right up there with Jason, and Freddy Cruger.  Jessica Lange is Awesome as ususal.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cant stop playing. I just wish I didn't have it linked to FB I like the 24 hour quest.
B007HJ9NBE|2.0|I was expecting so much more!  They cut so many of the best parts out!  I was really disappointed. They changed almost all of the music!
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|it gives you fake passwords. I tried getting on a Internet connection and it gave me fake passwords. I do not recommend this app at all.
B003DBOS7Y|3.0|Not very impressed with this movie the whole obsession the man has with the woman is borderline psychotic didn't really feel this one it was okay but not worth the 2 hrs i spent watching  it a definite chick flick. I still find a Walk to Remember much better
B0079T9HL8|5.0|This guy here is awesome.<br /><br />It's highly efficient and very comfortable. Keeps your gear safe.<br />I know I will never go back to any other system.<br /><br />My neck burns with the factory straps.<br />I have tried the slings, and I just hate the way my gear feels when it's swaying and banging against my leg, wall, ground and chair, and everything else near me.<br /><br />Rugged mesh allows my back breath. The velcro in this thing allows full comfort customization!!!<br />I just refuse to believe that there is anything better that this guy. Serious...
B00G15MWSG|5.0|Great Quality product awesome dvd and overall great customer service!<br />picture quality is awesome and the subtitles were flawless! would highly recommend
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|It works as advertised. I am using it on a new MacBook Air with Mavericks and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because when I have my external hd plugged into it, it has to reset it or cuts out power to the external hard drive for a few seconds.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great animation! It is a funny movie with modern lessons for the whole family. The quality of the stream was great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Bought as a present for me and my significant other.  He loves the trilogy and watching it over and over.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Still fun movie.  Even though Bruce Willis has become self absorbed.  I was not sure if I was going to watch it.  Considering his last New Die hard films which were terrible.  He just looked like a guy instead of acting but just was there doing whatever without any added character in fact the Die hard character wasn't even there. It was as if someone else was playing the character, no charm to the character just lada do this and move the character to do that.  Anyway back on the review.  This one surprised me.  Wasn't lazy in his role though still he seemed burned out.  The show is fun to watch.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Bought as a present for me and my significant other.  He loves it.  To have the complete series is great and no commercials.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This works ok on Netlfix and Youtube but Roku performs better with more channels to choose from.  If you are buying this to cast from your chrome browser - don't.  The video lags the audio and freezes then jumps to catch up.  It feels like you are watching an old godzilla movie dubbed in bad english that jumps all over the place. Maybe higher download speeds would help - I don't know.<br /><br />For now this is a poor man's roku - I'd spend twice as much to buy that instead. If they add more channels it might be more useful.
034580404X|5.0|Bought this trilogy for myself.  LOVED IT.  Can't wait for the movies. The content was a little risky but I'm sure it will be cleaned up in the movie, but I hope not too much.
B00G21XNKU|4.0|Cheers!<br />It's a tribute to the old school as well. For the die-hard (s) who will know what that means.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Not the right cord, but I can use it for other things.  Not the right cord, but I can use it for other things.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If the Outlook Hotel doesn't lead you to the &#34;drinking life&#34;, nothing will.  This story hit home in a lot of ways. Had me thinking a lot about my own life...the good and the bad.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  It took me back to a time i was devouring Stephen King books.  His style of character development is unparalleled. I love the way King pulls the different stories of the book together to a cohesive conclusion. I found myself hating and loving the different characters.  I must admit that there were times in this book that I thought..&#34;no way would this ever happen in real life&#34;.  Then I reasoned that of course not, this is a Stephen King Book; then just enjoyed the rest of it as a tale from the great story teller of the 20th & 21st centuries without worrying about suspended belief.  The last half of the book I totally ingested and could not put down until it was finished.  That alone convinces me that this was one awesome tale. What I didn't like was how easily the antagonist was overcome.  I was hoping for less of a happy ending.
B00112C4EG|5.0|It's lifelike, has good details and good quality. My son loves it and collect dozens of Schleich animal toys. Good for educational toys.
1476727651|4.0|Actually the book deserves four and a half stars, unfortunately Amazon does't allow me to rate it at that and so I had to settle for the lower rating because I couldn't, in all honesty, give it 5 stars. I have certain issues with the book which I will get to later in the review. Let me first say that I loved the book. Being a fan of 'Shining' and Stephen King in general, I knew I had to get a hold of this book. And with that cracker of an opening, I was firmly convinced the book wouldn't disappoint. For the most part it didn't. However, there were certain aspects of the book that I wish were, I don't know, different?<br /><br />For those of you who haven't read the book yet, don't read beyond this, it has spoilers. Those of you who have read the book, or don't mind the spoilers, read on.<br /><br />My first issue with the book is Dan's character. I'm told there's Doctor Crazy sleeping beneath the facade of Doctor Sleep. But I don't see him and I wanted to. Just that one incident of him choking Abra thinking she was Rose wasn't enough. I wanted to see more of that insanity that he fought so hard to keep a bay. I understand it not surfacing during his sober years, but I wanted to see what he'd inherited from Jack Torrance.<br /><br />Speaking of, I loved that little glimpse of Jack Torrance we got at the very end. It was poignant.<br /><br />My second issue was the climax. I didn't quite understand why only Horace Derwent lived in that mental locker and not Mrs Masey and why he attacked Silent Sarey. Surely he would've been pissed at Dan for keeping him locked up all these years? Did Dan and Abra make him attack her? I don't know. I wish he was a little more clear with that.<br /><br />My final issue is the lack of the spine tingling terror that makes 'Shining' one of my all time favorites. The True Knot, while menacing in their own right, paled in comparison to Outlook. Of course Abra, being the super human that she is, could pull out Deus Ex Machina whenever she felt like it, so that never really allowed the True to be truly frightening.<br /><br />I was actually half hoping that Dan would die in the end and that King would leave us with a befitting tragedy to end the series. Alas, that was not be.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|It's lifelike, has good details and good quality. My son loves it, and collected dozens of Schleich animal toys. Great educational toys.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is awesome,,, excellent,,, and bodacious!!!!!! It has good graphics and is easy to learn. It is a great alternative for people who don't have a major gaming system and for taking on the go. It is way better than that TMNT classic game that is taken from the Nintendo platform.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie is rude, crude, vulgar and without redeeming value. Julia Roberts should get rid of her handlers (manager, agent, etc) for allowing her to even look at this movie, let alone star in it and get top billing in it. She must have either lost a bet or been blackmailed -- this part is so beneath her talent or her dignity. Natalie Portman -- seems to fit right into this milieu. This is an embarrassment for Julia Roberts -- so sad.<br /><br />The only reason I've given it one star is because Amazon obviously feels that everyone deserves at least something. Balderdash.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game has excellent graphics and is easily learned. It's just like playing the game on a major gaming system but without all the extra controls. I am really satisfied with the graphics and the sound. It is a great game and oh yeah! It is mobile!
B00957T6X6|2.0|I love the books, but packaging them as one ebook without a hyperlinked contents page makes navigating nearly impossible. Lazy production values here.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I don't know why others are having an issue with their kindle and this app because mine work's great. As far as having Facebook, that really is an unfair quality but all the same, a . Person could make an account and set it to private and just use it for gaming.
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|*UPDATE* May 27, 2015<br />Reducing this down to 1 star. It has been a decent hub, but the issues are with how cheaply this was made. From day one, I had intermittent issues with the pins in the hub being placed at different heights, basically causing me to insert and re-insert my USB cables several times until it would slide in. I mostly ignored the issue, rearranging cables whenever this happened, but today, while trying to plug in an iPhone cable, the USB side caught a pin in the hub and with just a little bit of force short circuited the whole thing.<br />*END UPDATE*<br /><br />Bus powered means you can't plug in multiple hard drives and reach the true bandwidth and speed that USB 3.0 offers. This is good for small jump drives and peripherals (mouse), but not so much for bus powered hard drives or card readers (like a photographer might need). For that, you'll need a plug in powered hub. A little more cumbersome, but worth it for the speed.<br /><br />UPDATED: Anker support staff has been incredibly diligent and helpful in providing me a more useful option.  They suggested their powered hub for my uses, which has proven to be a lot better of an option: [[ASIN:B005QWY3PU Anker%C2%AE Uspeed 4 Port Adapter Chipset]] Thanks Anker!
B002NZV68U|2.0|Wierd movie. Much worse than the original. I realize it was Tim burton, but I did not like the adaptation.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought one for my main entertainment center and one for the bedroom - both get used heavily on a daily basis. If you're at all in the Google ecosystem (YouTube, Google Play Movies/TV, or Google Music), this is a no-brainer. I still can't believe the price.<br /><br />With the SDK coming to indie developers, I can only imagine this will become more and more useful.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|compared to Red this is a cliche filled dog. Just an overall disappointment. Acting was so predictable and lack luster
B0000085N4|4.0|This review is not reviewing the music..just the 2000 remaster sound quality.<br />As compared to the original 1989 release through Beggar's Banquet/Warner Reprise, this 2000 remaster is marginally better.<br />I was expecting the complete restoration treatment that the \\"Love\\" release received. Love is totally worth buying again for not only the marked sound improvement, but the bonus tracks on a second CD that's included. This remaster is a small step up in sound quality from 1989 and  The \\"Pure Cult\\" Greatest Hits was another small step better than this 2000 release.<br /> If you have the original 1989 Sonic Temple, it's probably not worth the money to buy it again. I was disappointed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is such a great game. Fun, yet challenging, pandemic always keeps me coming back for more. You should download this game right now.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book is the best dictionary. You can look up words and not have to use the Internet. It's better than DICTIONARY.COM!! I love it!!!
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|Acting could have been better.  Action was good.  Bad guys did not have brains.  To many points in story were predictable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was a great read and I especially like the way it tied into &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.  Finished it too soon...
B000MD9UJC|3.0|This works okay, but it definitely isn't shangri-la. It makes a nice bright light, at LEAST comparable to the original (non-led) bulb.  The switch is also ok.  The biggest problem is integrating with the original light.  The original light is OFF when the the lens is screwed down all the way.  To make this one work, you have to leave the lens unscrewed (in the original ON position).  That setup is cumbersome as the lens is almost completely unscrewed to get it to work.  I'm sure there is a simple workaround, but I was hoping for a more plug-n-play solution.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is a really good album of Vince Gill and Paul Franklin doing covers of ten Buck Owens and Merle Haggard originals.<br /><br />Buck Owens and Merle Haggard recorded in Bakersfield, California and their sound became known as the &#34;Bakersfield sound&#34;, hence the title of this CD.<br /><br />All ten songs covered here are excellent. My only complaint is that there are only ten songs clocking in at just 37 minutes.<br /><br />But apart from that, this is a first rate CD. Highly recommended.
B000FC0ZEO|4.0|The final chapter takes a long winding turn with twists, and turns, that are unexpected.<br />Our fine author pulls it all together giving a true sense of the skilled and the wit, of lives lists and found
B00F3VOL38|3.0|Great sound quality, but mostly a lot of the same songs as presented on BBC volume one.  There was nothing on this that has not been heard before really.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It say 90 million users? I bet half can't even log in. I have been trying to log in for 3 months and it says it's taking too long to log in .no it's taking to long for the people who made this app to fix it that's what's taking to long. Don't get this app you won't be able to log in or create an account
B003Y8YXEO|3.0|I have to be honest,  I have no clue why I bought this,  everything worth having on this disk, has been issued on the John Lennon Collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy,think quick  game that starts out easy and encourages you to do more difficult tasks.I recommended this game for my<br />grandchildren.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|Time for Jeff to hang it up.  This CD didn't do much for me at all.  The days of ELO are over.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's a must have in these times.  It is always easy to use and user friendly.  To do real business on your computer is is a necessity.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul is awesome.  Even though he is over 70 years of age, he can still put out incredible music, which is relevant even today.
B001AXME2S|5.0|This is a great band, one of the greatest for this time in music.  It really rocks! If you like any of Shinedown, you will love this.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I did like this CD,  I thought I would not.  I still have issues with the additions of Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, wearing Peter and Aces make up,  but at least the music is pretty good, even though Thayer seems to replicate old  KISS solos done previously by ACE throughout the entire album.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family from times past.  I find it very easy to use and understand.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|I found this.... remix to be very good,  but maybe not needed.  I did like it, but there was not much here that wasn't there before, mostly the remix takes advantage of technology which didn't exist before.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is a blast and great for all ages.  It's challenging and fun, from the difficult card arrangements to the cute gopher.  The only bad part is when you complete all the fairways.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Just another reason to be overly impressed by the master himself Sir Paul McCartney.  Is there anything Sir Paul can not do?
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I LOVE the Piano Guys! I have all there Cd's and this is another awesome one! This is some great Christmas music for the whole family!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Better to play with a lot of candy then to eat it!!  Healthier and keeps your mind focused. My sweet tooth had been satisfied.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Overall a very good book. But I gave two stars for how sad it was. I cried several times because of it.
1594204217|5.0|Informative and entertaining. Cooked has great stories of the people and history of humans and how that relates to the things we eat and the way we cook.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is one of the most amazing Christmas CD's ever. I didn't even think twice when deciding whether to get this for Christmas! We love the piano guys!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great cd!  From start to finish this cd is a really great listen!  Adele's voice is absolutely beautiful!  Get this cd!
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the special effects were excellent.  Still, you can't just take an enemy who has been known to have caused the creation of Iron Man in the first place and change him into something totally different with no impact on anyone.  That's just bad writing and even worse scripting.<br /><br />I do wish the movie industry would grow up and realize that what worked in the comic books so awesomely will work equally well on the silver screen now that we have CGI effects to draw on and amazing artists to put it all together.  Why change a formula that has worked so well.  It's like the absolutely stupid idea of making Galactus a cloud because you don't like the look of a robot on screen.<br /><br />Don't toy with what the fans expect to see or your movie will end up like those last two lackluster Fantastic Four releases.
B00005ABIP|4.0|Cake is one of my favorite bands.  This cd is good, but it's not their best work.  I would reccommend this to anyone who likes the band Cake.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like to play but some of the challenges are too hard to get through. I enjoy playing but not when I get stuck for months at a time. Then it seems more like a job rather than a game.
0060872675|5.0|you can make up a song for the &#34;where is my cow/daddy&#34; stanzas and mix singing with reading. Plus... it is Terry Pratchett, so what's not to like?!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would like to see more of my friends contacts and less of how they are doing on a game. I can see how they are ding on a game I don't need it repeated on facebook.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love it! Book a fan from the very beginning. I have loved the Piano Guys since &#34;Love Story Meets Viva la Vida&#34; and &#34;Michael Meets Mozart.&#34;
B009G41CG2|5.0|I never knew what Mahjong was until I started playing it on facebook. There are several different games to play. I love the challenge as long as I can make out the pictures. sometimes they are so small you can barely tell them apart.
B001706I5I|5.0|James Carrey is fabulous in this movie. Lots of humor and great moral of the story. This is a movie you can watch<br />over and over.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fast moving fun and challenging. Would be more fun if it would accept a click instead of having to click 2-3 times before it accepts your points.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Can usually follow along &know what is going on but I must have fallen asleep somewhere in the middle . Very slow till the end
B0096HFOZO|3.0|This was a short book. It was very boring and quick to read. Read this book if you are 5 and not 11-6.
B006C45CFG|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and love anything with Harrison Ford and liked the action scenes. The special effects were very good.
0061733199|5.0|Just awesome. Remember to keep fat or butter in your survival kits, its hard to come by in nature. That's just the first few pages.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is amazing and addicting! I watched the whole season in one day! It's creep, intricate and full of surprises. I would definitely recommend it.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Got this for my spouse as she is a big fan of this series more so than I. Great buy at a great price. Thanks, Amazon!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have really enjoyed saving ideas to an easily accessible app. It has helped me a  great deal in deciding what to do in this newly purchase short sale house. It has made it a joy.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Enjoying this game.  I have had no problems with the game working and find the story line fun.  I have been a die-hard Zynga gamer for a few years and very excited they are branching out to the Kindle.
B00F522C7C|5.0|Chabela saw this picture at the multiplex, and loved it.  Already a serious movie fan at the age of 3.5, she ranks Planes at the top of her list, right there along with Cars.
B008JDAC7G|2.0|SHOULDNT ASK FOR SO MUCH INFORMATION AND ASKS FOR STUFF I BARLEY KNOW...BUT I GUESS THE GAME IS FUN AND SORTA
0763644765|5.0|A friend lent me this book in the spring when we began thinking of potty training our son, and we liked it so much we bought our own copy. We read the story before we began training to familiarize our son with what would happen, letting him try now and then as interested, and continued reading it during the beginning stages of committed training to reinforce the concepts.<br /><br />This book covers the understanding that there is a feeling before needing to go to the bathroom, the appropriate place to go to the bathroom, the fact that sometimes time is needed before something will happen, the celebration of success and the transition to different undergarments. I like that the character is deliberating and controlling using the potty throughout the book (not mom or dad forcing him to, in fact, they are only present on the celebration of success page). We knew going into training that it would be an issue to convince our son to sit long enough, and this book was a great asset because of it's thoughtful content on that matter. The only thing I don't prefer in the book is the use of the word \\"undies\\" at the end instead of underwear, but obviously that is just personal terminology preference. I love that the book ends with such a positive tone that you and your child feel excited about potty training.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading it next spring with our second child to get his potty training started.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I've read Donna Tartt's other books and especially enjoyed The Secret History. I was drawn into The Goldfinch immediately. It takes off on a fast pace for several hundred pages and then it begins to slow down and go off on a different track. It loses its rhythm and after a while became a bit annoying and totally unbelievable. My three star rating is for the beginning pages. My three stars are for research on fine antiques and the pages I enjoyed.
B00FVZJUS2|2.0|The picture quality is terrible.  Film was ok for my five year old, but even through HDMI cables, the picture was awful.  I won't be getting any more movies expecting ROKU viewing to be tolerable.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|One of the better hidden object games out there. The different goals and objectives help make game play fun. Also the different puzzles that are offered add variety to a game that might otherwise get old.
B009NNMB70|5.0|When my grand daughters wanted to go see this movie, I thought I would probably sit and squirm and want it to get over fast.  Well that just did not happen.  I loved it.  These boys were humbling in telling their story.  Their songs had me singing right along and clapping.  Who ever put this together did an outstanding job.  I told the grandkids I loved the movie and could watch it again.  And indeed I will I'm buying it.....This took me back to the 1960's when a sweet group of boys from England enchanted us The  Beatles.....they indeed reminded me of those wonderful boys back in the 1960's.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Well worth the small fee for dl'ing. Seriously, if your a Mythos fan, this game is a must have. Challenging, addicting, and very true to its source material, this is one of the finest mobile games I've ever played.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It was much better than I expected from the mixed reviews I heard.  I remember loving the book and was dubious about it being true to the story or even simply entertaining. The acting was great and the cinematography was striking!
B003BWERF8|4.0|This is a great product if you are looking to use your iPod Classic with wireless headphones this is what you need
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Doesn't work with Windows 7; impossible to set up, even with online help and forums. I bought a Blu-Ray player instead.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works great I do have to reset it almost every time I want to use it- but I love it
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I am sure it is not for everyone with the language and sexual references but we laughed our a***** off! Actually had to pause the movie because we had tears running down our face from laughing so hard and could not see.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Awesome bond flick.<br /><br />Action, suspense with all the right mix to keep it true to the series.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed this one.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|I bought this knife in the San Mai steel,and it is simply the  sharpest and best looking knife I own.I have many Cold Steel knives,but this is my first San Mai.If you are undecided about whether to get a San Mai or carbon steel,I heartily recommend the San Mai.You will be gald you did.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Once again the Piano Guys go above and beyond!! Christmas albums seem to be hit or miss and the Piano Guys definitely HIT!!
B00006GA4C|5.0|I have been waiting years for this remastered version of the Red Album.I was in the Air Force and over in the NAM. This album rocked the barracks with the heavy BASS and driving sound.The music from the barracks on several occasions attracted some GRUNTS coming out of the bush on to our base. They made a detour into the barracks. I mean, it was heavy.Especially, listening to \\"Paranoid\\", for the first time. The baby crying at the end, freaked us out.This album is a must. It was right up there with the ZEP in 1970. With the fighter jets blasting bye and Hueys choppin in the sky this album in music, was the \\"MOMENT\\".
B000FC130E|5.0|I bought this boom one night when looking for a new book to read. I had heard of Neil Gaiman for years but had never read any, of his work. This book full of rich characters and stunningly decorative scenes hooked me early and held my attention all the way to the end.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is Taylor Swift's best album yet.  It's got a lot more upbeat material, and I love pretty much every song on it!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I just really loved this...I think it´s  a huge accomplishment for Vanessa´s first novel...well written, emotionally stirring and educational...well done!
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|Great detail.  McFarlane does such wonderful work and anyone who is a Walking Dead or Daryl Dixon fan would be happy to have this in their collection.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The series has been good overall. At times there are episodes that seem like fluff or aren't needed but overall it was good.
B00BEJ5O6Q|2.0|Only a few good songs. Maybe I just need to buy the greatest hits cds from artist. I seem to get disappointed more than not.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Entertaining movie, but it's all the same history about vampire hunting etc....I wish  I could see more about what caused the virus to transform people to zombies...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending was.. Was not what I expected, but closed an amazing series, that captured all of the worlds attention.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|While this album don´t sound like DEEP PURPLE, and there´s NO Ritchie Blackmore on the guitars, i really like COME TASTE THE BAND!!!!All the songs ROCKS!!!! DEEP PURPLE RULES!!!!!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|It does exactly what its supposed to do, works very well. I would suggest a smaller tip for five stars.
B000002LPD|5.0|FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE is one of VAN HALEN´s best albums, and my favourite with the great vocals from Sammy Hagar!!!! All the songs ROCKS like POUNDCAKE, JUDGEMENT DAY, RUNAROUND, RIGHT NOW, PLEASURE DOME and MAN ON A MISSION!!!!GREAT ALBUM!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED for Heavy Rock lovers around the world!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Hmm maybe it's just my wireless but nothing is being picked up.. maybe my Kindle needs a newer firmware or something... who knows. The app sucks
B00340ESIS|5.0|The first book is not replaced by 2nd and third, only exanded by them. So start with the first on of the series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I would recommend this to every si-fi reader. this book includes action with a little bit of hardship in it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book to the very end.  The main character, Augustus, was someone I was rooting for the entire time.  The story tries to get the reader into the head of a boy who has to deal with something none of us readers has ever had to.  His struggle to get through life as an ordinary kid is so challenging. The writing was well done and brought the reader from sympathy to empathy. Hated to see it end.  You WILL enjoy the time you spend with &#34;Auggie&#34;.
B00GX59QO2|1.0|Am I really one of the few people left in the universe who doesn't think that visuals of people being murdered, dying in agony, is funny?  These are great actors.  Get them some writers.
1455525839|4.0|White Fire (Pendergast): Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child: 2013. Glad they came back to good tracks after their 3 last failed books, thanks to the patronage of Conan Doyle. Classic, predicable but entertaining (Nov 2013)
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great acting and great storyline, weaving together three or four plot lines including Walt's illness, his descent into criminality, the dynamics of his family as well as Jesse's family and those of Walt's in-laws.  The series rolls along like a wave gathering momentum.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get this app!!!!!!!! It is the best app ever , with great things you have to dodge  and very awesome choices for what kind of minion or realm you want to choose this app is overall the best game I've played ever oh , and this is much better than temple run 1 &amp; 2 , Thanks!!!
B0037OOU8O|5.0|Although it is quite funny, the humor touches on some very profound and uncomfortable truths. The ending is a gut punch that drives it all home.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story was interesting, a bit slow going. I found it a bit unnerving that the wife &#34;went along with&#34; the secret. This story was an example of karma coming back to bite you. The last 20% of the book was the best part.
B000W94FE6|5.0|This was really a groundbreaking work. Was ahead of its time, it anticipated the increasing importance of brain Sciences and function in understanding human function and behavior.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Very funny and entertaining, I loved the music video it has on it! It was fun but I did get bored with it pretty quick.
B009AMANH4|3.0|The movie is OK, but, on the boring side. This is more of a History lesson than anything else. I thought the the acting to be only so-so, nothing Academy Award deserving.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I really loved this game but it was freezing very badly so I had to uninstall it, if this problem is fixed I will get it again!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|The object of this \\"physics\\" game is to let go of a swinging rock, which dangles from a rope, in time to take out various objects. You get an opportunity to practice each round until you conquer it, and then you go \\"for real\\". There are also a few challenge levels to plow through. Overall, it's a fun game to kill time.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Love this song, nice comeback after her last album. Okay the review is making me type more words....and really nothing else to say.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a game much like Hay Day, where you build, bake, go on quests, etc. I don't know why I like it so much, but I find this is the game I go to when I want to relax. I am currently enjoying the Kris Kringle quests added for the holidays. Unlike Hay Day, where you just create and maintain a farm, there are new lands to explore and endless quests to complete. I may get tired of it eventually, but not yet!
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Thought the action was just to much. I enjoy action shows, but thought this was over the top. Probably would not want to watch a sequel.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|It's the Goonies! This movie was great when it was made and still stands the test of time. Like the Goonies themselves, this movie will never die.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|game works well for me, play olit all the time. one of my favorite games to play when im bored
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|A lot of fun. Very addictive  and makes the time pass by quickly. I never played this game before. A lot of fun.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|One of the better Star Trek stories. Well made. Great acting. Good graphics and photography. We love it and watch it often!
1609611543|5.0|This a must read for anyone, who is serious about losing weight, has a diabetes or arthritis. I have none of those ailments or conditions and I have been a bread lover forever!! I slowly started to phase it out of my diet and now I am bread free!! I don't eat cookies, bagels bread, or any kind of pastries...period. Processed food is not on my menu.<br />Grains are digested and converted to sugars and create cravings for more sweet stuff! Exorphins kick in and you will be hungry and crave cookies, pastries, sodas and who knows what else...!<br />Awesome book, one of my favorites!!
6305428050|4.0|Funny! Lots of 80's references, but the jokes are still good. Not a 5-star movie per se, but definitely good for what it is.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Best Christmas cd ever! I absolutely love to listen to it!  Beautiful renditions of classic Christmas songs.  This cd is definitely worth the money to buy it!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had this sent to me because I thought the charger for my Kindle was faulty. It turned out to be the kindle itself, but Amazon allowed me to keep this charger for free. I love that it also comes with the little plug adaptor box. I use it everyday, and it hasn't failed me once.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's a fun game to play but gets harder as you go. It's also a fun game to play with friends and family!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Thanks for bringing kik back :)))) at first it wouldnt log in then i went to the store n it waas gone the app is back. Kik me @Yuumad_bro
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Loved Cello wars, one of my favorites on this album. You guys are awesome, keep up the good work, money well spent!
0307743659|5.0|This book is WAY better than the movie (typical, right?)!  The twists & turns at every  moment - I was completely enthralled the whole way through!!!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The Piano Guys created yet another master piece. Keep the music coming. This albums is worth the money.  Loved the lord of the Ring song on here!!!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I loved this book. Really engaging, excellent writing for the short format. Brandon Sanderson is an amazing writer! Would like to see a continuation perhaps.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|You guys are awesome!! I loved Angels We Have Heard on High. I also loved the music video for it. You guys are truly my favorite group. I listen to your music on a daily basis. Keep up the good work and for those who are thinking of buying this album, click the add to cart button, it is worth every penny!!!
B00BEIYL6G|5.0|Ashton Kutcher did a terrific job acting as Steve Jobs on the DVD JOBS.  Kutcher even had a very similar look to the real Steve Jobs.  It was almost like having access to a time machine.  I would highly recommend the DVD 'Jobs'.  I found myself feeling kudos were deserved for the Kutcher performance.  If you've been a Steve Jobs fan, you'll see strong similarities of these two men.<br /><br />If this sounds interesting, you'll enjoy your trip 'Back to the Future' to the Jobs Video.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Michael A. Phillips
0316069515|5.0|I pose the question in my heading seriously. Nearly every other author who seems to have a powerful reign over a genre falters eventually. They run out of ideas, their writing becomes bland, their stories mismatched.<br /><br />However, with this latest offering from Connelly, it is evident that he has much more skill and energy left. This is an amazing book, one I struggled with putting down often. I was motivated to finish it in one sitting but was forced to break it up due to time constraints. Nevertheless, I still finished the book within one day and was very pleased with it.<br /><br />It's gotten to the point with me that with Michael Connelly books I don't even care for a synopsis before delving into the story anymore. He's proven to me repeatedly that he is the best there is and I just go straight into the book, letting the writing tell the story.<br /><br />Like all of his previous books, it is apparent this one was very well-research. Mr. Connelly isn't merely a writer; he seems to be a student of his craft. I can tell that he meticulously researches everything in his stories. Additionally, his characterization skills are impeccable. All of his characters are personable and presented with such wit and craft that I am often unable to accept that they are fictional characters. How could they be, when they are presented so realistically, with flaws, desires, pains, attitudes, etc.?<br /><br />Yet another book that solidifies Michael Connelly's stance as the best of the best when it comes to the crime/thriller genre.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, but those dang chocolate pieces. 5 stars great game.<br />Download it now, whatcha waiting for. Do it, do it Meow.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Even though there are a lot of medical terms and concepts, Dr. Perlmutter does a good job explaining these terms and concepts to the layman's understanding while remaining professional.  This book is an eye opener to the old saying &#34;you are what you eat&#34;.  Some professionals in the medical field, in my opinion, tend to treat the symptoms and don't look for the cause of ailments such as ALS, Parkinson's, diabetes, etc.  Dr. Perlmutter explains how the human body processes food and how it interacts / effects the brain which signals other organs of the body, which, depending on the foods we eat, can have negative effects leading to life threatening problems as mentioned above.  You have to read the book to understand what fat and cholesterol might not be your enemies.
B0000714BP|5.0|Just love this movie....and am giving this copy as a Christmas gift to a friend.  I think she'll enjoy it  A very funny movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that you don't have to ask anything from your friends in order to play and have a good time.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a great story for all ages!  It has beautiful color and depth.  Can be watched over and over.
0767919408|5.0|I was not familiar with Bill Bryson when I purchased this book.  I like non-fiction and it was on a best seller list so I grabbed it.  I was not dissappointed at all.  Bryson is a master of moving seamlessly from one interesting topic or issue to another and back again in a way that keeps you completel engaged.  He provides an excellent compliment of facts, hisorical significance, and perspective from both that period in our history and the contemporary.  I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to read history about the 1920s in America without any political agenda or any other subjectiveness to not pass this book up.  It is a fun read about a signficant time in America.
B0090SI582|4.0|Disks were in perfect condition and arrived exactly when I was told.  My only complaint is that the case was busted.  Since this was a Blu-ray, I did not have a spare case to put it in so I had to tape the bottom of the case.  Broken case is why I only this gave 4 stars.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|This action figure is HUGE! Much bigger than ones I have bought before. I purchased it for my husband for Christmas- he is going to love it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Must have if you're a sci-fi fan<br /><br />They did a great job in converting to DVD. Absolutely amazing quality from the originals.
B008MM9630|4.0|My daughter loves playing this game. She seen it in the appstore, and had me to download it for her.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Only tried it briefly and then put it away. My daughter purchased a new 32 inch TV and wanted to try it and she's had it ever sense and likes it. May have to order another one so that I can try it out more extensively. Maybe I will sometime after I hear about more content being added.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Not to be repetitive on the album breakdowns already given, I will just say that this is a great record. It certainly does sound like Boston. As with all life forms, the Boston spaceship continues to evolve into something really special. It would be a drag to hear the same thing over and over again and Tom does not disappoint this Boston fan. Like the previous two reviewers stated, please don't make us wait another 10+ years for the next record... :-)
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Have to say am very much hooked on this CD. Have not changed it in my truck CD player in two months. If you're a Megadeth fan then you need to get this.
B006CUZ8S6|5.0|We enjoyed the extra scenes included in this extended version!  Several were very short, but they were delightful.  Definitely worth it as a replacement for an old DVD.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|As a little bit of biological God Stuff, I salute this amazing effort. I Have written a wealth of articles on this very idea and am willing to share my thinking with you. Please feel free to email me at niceast@gmail.com or visit at [...] .<br />Sincerely, Nic East
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It passes the time for me when needed. My only complaint is acorns are difficult. For once I don't mind purchasing something for a game: however I won't buy acorns because it doesn't seem like you get enough for your 'actual' money. Otherwise I really liked game.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Interesting at times, but VERY dark and  depressing, dwelling a bit too heavily on the main character's drug use, insanely detailed, for my liking
B005PK1G76|5.0|Really convenient and stores a lot when we're out and about. My only complaint is the velcro straps, I would have preferred clips or something like that so it was easier to move around. We use it on our city mini and it works perfectly. Overall, a good buy.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Just start pronunciation but love it, want to read more but have to rate first otherwise never get in there
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a good mix of temple run and subway surfers, I love how you battle different people and go to New places. It's so awesome I just love it so much with all its power ups and slides and characters and its also funny. I'm like married and attached to this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series of books is an a must read series. It is very explanatory and everything sort of makes sense. This is probably the best series I have ever read in my entire life. If I were to recommend one series of books of all that I have read this would be the series I would pick. Although I am only 11 I read a lot. This is the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|fifty shades of grey; all the books<br />This book is absolutely great, kept the reader wanting to come back for more. I have read all of the books in the series.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Very bright led light.  I put this in my garage and now that it has gotten cold at night I am glad I put it there, the fluorescent  bulbs still take a while to warm up while this guy is full brightness right away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book love the series and all the action, couldn't ask for anything more.  The movies are great as well!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Had an old Mac power supply which was not compatible with my new Macbook Air.  This adapter works perfectly and is much cheaper than buying a new power supply.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|This book is a quick read and it's a lot of fun. It's written by one of the top scientists the world has seen. It is full of humor and interesting anecdotes.
B00874T02K|5.0|This is a powerful and easy to use app.  I love the work out that I get with this app.  I love the fact that this app tracks my activity and reminds me of my next work out.
0345529057|4.0|Very good reading.  The plot twists and turns and surprises you.  It's hard to keep track of all the characters.  The author did an amazing job of creating and interweaving characters, geography and cultures.
B0027MJU00|4.0|You’ve read countless books this year with near perfect heroes/heroines and villains that are just plain evil and one dimensional who you love to hate. If you want a break from that then this is a book for you. Almost every character in the books is so incredibly flawed, gritty and just downright messed up.<br /><br />I’m not going to give a lot of detail as this is a murder mystery and I really don’t want to ruin it for anyone. The story is told in the present and past from the views of Libby, Patty and Ben. Ben is currently serving a life sentence for killing his mother Patty and two sisters the sole survivor of that night was Libby. The story unfolds as Libby searches for some answers from that night. All of her chapters are in the present. Ben and Patty’s Chapters are from the few days leading up to the massacre until everything unfolds.<br /><br />I bet you are thinking oh but Libby must be likable right, she is the victim. Well you would be so wrong on that account. The murders were twenty some years ago and Libby having witnessed some of her families deaths is not a well-adjusted adult. She suffers from depression, kleptomania and is a master manipulator. To Flynn’s credit I would be surprised if someone who survived a trauma like that at a young age came out all sunshine and happiness. I will say that Libby did grow on me as I went through the book I began to sympathize with her as she started to try to get a handle on her life. Actually the only character I liked in the book for the longest time was the grown up incarcerated Ben.<br /><br />I was totally drawn in by the mystery and the events leading up to the actual murders. But this is not for the faint of heart it is gritty and mean at times. Patty is a broken woman who had an abusive husband and is now trying to raise four kids on her own, however she is exhausted and poor and really doesn’t keep great track of them. Young Ben is fifteen at the time of the murders his chapters were the most riveting for me as I watched him back a series of bad decisions that led up to that fateful night.<br /><br />As for the mystery of that night, well I didn’t guess it correctly. That is a good indicator of a good mystery. All my theories were wrong, wrong, wrong. I got one tiny section of the murders right but everything else I totally blew and I love it when that happens. This is a smart book with intricate characters that definitely do not fall into any normal mold. It is different and that is what I like about this author the most.<br /><br />So when you are ready for something a little out of the norm Gillian Flynn is a good bet.riveting for me as I watched him back a series of bad decisions that led up to that fateful night.<br /><br />As for the mystery of that night, well I didn’t guess it correctly.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to people of all ages! Heartwarming story about the important things in life. Very easy read.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|This book has a silly premise and the writing matches.  I couldn't make it through more than about 50 pages. Yuck.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Totally worth the pennies I worked so hard for to read this. Even to give some of them to Allie...
B003VR5PPY|4.0|The story is gripping! I'm not the type who generally replays a game, but I had to know each multiple ending. Only gripe is not being able to save at crucial story junctures so I don't have to replay every puzzle again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|So many twists and turns.  It revisits the old south. Loved it; finished in two days.  My wife will love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion rush is so much fun to play even though I am mot that great. I like the interactions with the characters,  the different,  costumes, and all the bonuses. It always feels like I am winning.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Love this movie! Purchased as a gift and arrived still in original plastic so that makes me very happy. This is a must watch for anyone but especially martial art lovers.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|What's not to like? Sully and Mike in the beginning. Humor, life lessons, and adventure abound and the ending was a little surprising to me.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was a great book! I really enjoyed it!It reflects some of his great early works! I loved it! Great!
0765365278|5.0|An amazing book, with characters I felt like I could relate to. I can't wait for the rest of the series!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The movie was scifi but it kept you going through the whole movie. It was done reall well. I'd watch it again.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love freecell. I used to spend hours playing on my PC. I was glad to see this as the FAOTD. I'm just as addicted to it on my Kindle Fire! The app is simple and clean, just the basic game with no fluff. It doesn't tell you when you're out of moves (which is strange), but it kinda adds to the challenge. Overall, a 5-star app!
B007UXSPK2|3.0|It was a typical Tom Cruise movie. It didn't keep my interest much. You could tell it was very unreal.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This book is what hooked me in to Kerrelyn Sparks! Loved the way she made the characters believeable (almost human!). From page one you can't put it down or in my case I just didn't want to!! lol Gotta read this!!
B00DMEQP46|2.0|Disappointing follow up (IMHO) to Congratulations.  I really enjoyed Oracular Spectacular, and was lukewarm towards Congratulations, but this one just doesn't do it for me.  I *want* to like it, but I just can't get into it...  :(
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a fascinating and enjoyable book. The story was great and very very entertaining. Grisham is a great entertaining writer
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am a John Grisham fan and I loved A Time to Kill. It was an interesting book about human nature and the legal system.
B003MC5N28|5.0|amazing book! I read it in high school & had to read it again. Looking forward to seeing the movie
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Good game. It is quite addictive, and I got a little bit obsessed with getting top scores on each level.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is a great product, I use it for Walking running and cycling. Only issue was the plastic band. Switched to the velco straps. problem solved.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Excellent app. This is a staple on all my phones and tablets. Excellent app. Well worth the money.<br /><br />HTC Amaze 4g (UNROOTED)
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|My 3 year old son loves &#34;New&#34; and Queenie Eye&#34; I was a little kid when Wings were popular. This album has an old feel to it.Buy it. You won't be dissapointed. Long Live Paul :) In his 70's and still hitting the high-notes.
B00846F1YW|2.0|This is ok at best as far as the hidden object part of it but the story leaves a lot to be desired...Try again devs.
B008JDAC7G|2.0|The reviewer that says these apps don't invade your privacy because their &#34;virus scanner&#34; didn't detect anything wrong...<br />is deluding themselves. Try any of the awesome privacy guard apps available (there's no shortage).<br />  The guy that says there's a better scaled down version on play store is wrong too- it also invades your &#34;account&#34; list.<br />*In Amazon's defense; There's only so many decent apps available, you can't give away all the great ones- so buyer (or FAOTDer) beware, use at your own risk. Some people only use tablets that contain no personal information- this would be perfect for that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down and for the price for all three of the books are REALLY worth it. I'm definitely buying the books. :D
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|Another excellent recording in the beautiful voice of Eliane Elias. In this particular recording the timber of her voice was beautifully captured and presented very natural.
B00GIGGS6A|5.0|The H610 Professional graphics tablet is excellent value for money. While it does suffer some minor software issues, the price is absolutely unbeatable for the overall product quality, and is highly recommended.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Large array of customization via hotkeys for each individual user, with the \\"hotkeys\\" bar labelled 1 - 16, rather than the named functions of the non-pro version.<br />2. Aesthetically attractive design. The pressable hotkeys have a nice feel to them and the tablet itself isn't too thick (althoguh it is somewhat bulky due to the width: consider desk space before purchase), standing at 13mm (1/2in) at the drawing level. The pen has a pleasing surface to it and isn't heavy at all as there is no AAA battery like the previous iterations.<br />3. Decent driver support (although this is discussed more below), and works with Windows 8.1.<br />4. Very cheap considering the alternatives.<br />5. Performs as expected.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Driver support is finicky and no CD is supplied for an external install. The software drivers are built in, although they did not automatically install for me on Windows 8.1, therefore I had to navigate to [...] and download the required drivers from there. This may be exclusive to W8.1, and isn't a big deal either way.<br />2. The pressure levels are somewhat skewed - you need a fairly hard press to actually achieve the maximum level and this is on the lightest pressure level. The device does pick up the slightest pressure, but the pressure level seems to mimic a curve rather than a linear pattern.<br />3. The drawing surface isn't as nice as my Wacom Bamboos. It has a nice grip to it but it's very hard, meaning it almost feels as though you are scratching the surface (think hard plastic on hard plastic), whereas the Bamboo felt much more rubbery / soft, and somewhat quieter as a result. This is a very slight issue however, and most will not notice it.<br />4. There is a minor glitch where sometimes the tablet will not recognise brush settings (in Photoshop CS6), such as opacity or dynamic sizing. Usually it only lasts for a moment and is only after you have clicked out of the program / used the mosue for a moment. Hopefully a driver update will address this issue.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />While my cons list is almost as big as my pros list, I have still given this a 5/5 as most of the negatives are very slight issues and can be patched through driver updates. The tablet performs as expected and the value is unbeatable; the Huion H610 Professional will definitely be replacing my old Wacom Bamboo.
B0094M0DJS|3.0|predictable film, no chance for character development but hey its a space aliens invade flick with guns and explosions so what do you expect?
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Slow for the first third, then it becomes worth the wait. The action is good and it's a feel-good ending.

B00G32QIEG|2.0|kinda want my money back on this one, just not a good film in my opinion<br />characters not believable, lacking story development

B002M5E2DW|4.0|I think there might be something to this. I can't dismiss it off hand. In my book [[ASIN:B00EN6ECFG Shards Of Divinities (A Spiritual Story)]] I discuss a principle that I call the Divine Dance. Basically, it's about dancing with adversity rather than fighting with it. I remember trying to play tennis as a youngster. When the ball would come at me really fast I would at first try to run towards it and hit it. I was hardly ever successful in returning the ball properly to my opponent in this fashion. I soon realized that I was opposing the motion of the ball. I was fighting with it. When I learned instead to dance with the ball I became much more successful in hitting back the ball to my opponent. What I learned do was to not run towards the ball and hit it but rather to let the ball come to me and to move my racket in the same direction as the ball. Once my racket made contact with the ball only then did I hit it back towards my opponent. I learned to resonate with the ball.<br /><br />The same principle applies to the martial arts expert who uses his opponent's strength against him. Instead of opposing the aggressive motions of his opponent, the expert martial artist moves in tandem with these motions and is able to defeat his opponent not by fighting him but rather by dancing with him.<br /><br />This principle of the Divine Dance is really at the root of all teachings relating to the 'Secret' type of books. You are not receiving blessings in your life because you are simply wishing for them or using some kind of attractive force. You are receiving those blessings when you learn to stop fighting with your desire to receive these blessings. The so called attractive force is a fictitious force just like the centrifugal force in physics is a fictitious force.<br /><br />If what I said sounds intriguing then please check out my book at [[ASIN:B00EN6ECFG Shards Of Divinities (A Spiritual Story)]] and I would really appreciate a review. My book is about far more than just the Divine Dance, it is about the successive paradigm shifts that redefine humanity's relationship with and understanding of the divine.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my words.<br /><br />Nissim Levy

B008FRFN7A|1.0|Does not work on my kindle fire HD to connect to my HP laser printer. The app finds and displays my printers, but will not connect. I am using a Brother print app to print to my Brother printer which works fine. Although the app did not cost me anything but a big waste of my time. I found out later that only a few HP printers (\\"web enabled\\") were supported on the HP connected website. I don't understand why HP can't provide an app to print to any wireless printer it recognizes. If their motive is sell printers, I can't believe many users will rush out any buy a new printer just to use this app.
B00170GXQ2|2.0|The film does not gel with me. You would think it would but I found it to be dull and too artsy for me. Ill take the classics over this. Some movies just dont click when you watch. This film and characters just didnt do anything for me, but that is just my tastes...I think it should be seen by anyone who is into vampires and horror.

B00FN3HRFA|5.0|I received this CD/DVD a week ago and have listened/watched it many times, of all the live albums Barbra has released, this is my favorite.  Her voice sounds great and she comes across as a nice, warm person who appreciates the fans who have have followed her throughout her career.  The song selection is terrific with some hits and some lesser known songs.<br />The first act begins with As If We Never Said Goodbye with lyrics tailored to her return to Brooklyn.  The new lyrics are fun and clever.  Next she sings some songs of the Bergman's  (Nice and Easy/That Face, The Way He Makes Me Feel) then does a stunning version of Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.  Didn't We is followed by a  touching tribute to Marvin Hamlisch (The Way We Were/Through The Eyes Of Love).  She closes with a medley of Jule Styne songs (Rose's Turn/Some People/Don't Rain On My Parade).<br />Act 2 opens with You're The Top (again with lyrics tailored to her return) then she brings out Chris Botti who accompanies her on his trumpet for What'll I Do/My Funny Valentine (absolutely stunning), Lost Inside Of You and Evergreen.  I've heard Evergreen many times but the combination of Barbra's voice and Botti's trumpet make this my favorite version.  Jason Gould then joins Barbra for a nice How Deep Is The Ocean, he has very good voice it's too bad he didn't start singing at an early age.  People, Here's To Life, Make Our Garden Grow and Some Other Time round out the set.<br />The DVD has some material that is not on the CD (I guess they cut some so it would fit on one CD), missing are:<br />Smile (with Il Volvo), a Q&A section, a song she sings for a child in the audience (Sam, You Made The Pants Too Long), No More Tears (where she pays a nice tribute to Donna Summer) and a video Jason Gould made for Barbra's birthday (He sings Nature Boy).  I prefer the CD as I can just have it on in the background around the house rather than watching the DVD.  The cuts made to the CD are not noticeable so they won't interfere with you listening enjoyment.  One more thing about the DVD, Barbra looks great!!n't interfere with you listening enjoyment.  One more thing about the DVD, Barbra looks great!!
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book!! I have read the book many of  times and I hope EL James writes a 4th book of Fifty shades of grey it was great book to read.
B008JFUS5A|3.0|I thought the movie was pretty good.  It was very similar to the first one.  I still don't buy the plot of the story with this sort of &#34;games&#34; going on for 75 years.  I think the movie would be better suited with a NON high tech theme, something like waterworld or road warriors.  Civilized people don't appreciate the killing of kids, but un civilized societies do.  One where the strong rule and the weak die.<br />I just can't see this scenario moving forward and then to have book 3 as it is,with district 13 makes even less of a believable arena, giving them a &#34;cease fire&#34; if they can tell others they nuked them?<br />I think the games concept is interesting but not with kids UNDER 18 fighting to the death.  I can see younger adults doing this but not kids 12-18, doesn't add up to me.<br />these districts would never allow this to happen for 75 years as they portray.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Poor ending to a pretty good series , author got away from everything she had built up the lead character to be in this book.  I wish I had never read this
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Great, absorbing fun, until you get to the point where you have to purchase the power boosters<br />to get to the next level.  Many different games included to play with, and really adorable, with great<br />graphics and cute sounds.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Too much blood and killing.  I liked the first Judge Dredd a lot better than this one.  Better acting in the first movie too.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Love this book! Recommend it to everyone Looking for a good book. I will read this again in a couple of years, just to remind me how lucky I am.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game when I have a few minutes to kill. the cards are easy to read and most games take less than 4 minutes. easy one tap playing is a plus!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Simply, awesome! I stayed up until 2am to finish reading this. I could not put it down. I think it is even better than the first book in the trilogy. I cannot wait to read the next one.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Boston fans have learned not to expect new music quickly, and this time is no exception, as it took Boston mastermind Tom Scholz a full 11 years to complete this set of songs. Truth be told, a few of the songs from the previous album, \\"Corporate America,\\" are re-recorded for this set. As far as the new songs go, it's safe to say that Scholz has found his songwriting chops once again. The lead single \\"Heaven on Earth\\" is great, but a few other nuggets are kind of like a modern version of the 70's and 80's classic Boston sound. The title track \\"Life, Love & Hope\\" is the best example of that sound since probably the \\"Don't Look Back\\" album. The track \\"Someday\\" sounds like it could have come from \\"Third Stage.\\" The ballads \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and the Kimberly Dahme vocal \\"If you Were in Love\\" are classic Boston as well. The update of \\"You Gave Up on Love\\" is breathtaking, and the maudlin ballad \\"I Didn't Mean to Fall in Love\\" fits in well with the set (although why they chose to include it as the second track on the album is strange). Also included is the Brad Delp vocal \\"Sail Away,\\" the last \\"new\\" Boston song he recorded. While this set doesn't contain a barn burner like \\"Smokin\\" or \\"Cool the Engines,\\" it doesn't need to. The songcraft is good enough to make this the best Boston release in a long time. It's just a shame that Boston fans have to wait so many years for new music.
0812550706|5.0|The book came quickly and was in good shape. This is a great book! I recommend it for readers of all ages.

B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|I'm not a music critic, I'm just a Pop music lover. Britney's discography is a dream for any pop star out there (Gaga Included).<br /><br />From her first CD: Baby One More Time to Femme Fatale, Britney has delivered catchy pop anthems that are known worldwide.<br /><br />With her 8th album &#34;Britney Jean&#34; (Her full name is Britney Jean Spears&#34; in case you didin't know), Britney provides an enjoyable listen from start to end. This is one of her most cohesive albums to date: not club banger filled like Femme Fatale or Blackout, and not bubblegum pop like her first 3 records.<br /><br />Britney has grown up in front of the world's eyes. She's learned a lot about life and herself. She's a mature Britney and &#34;Britney Jean&#34; shows it. Not only she co-wrote each of the songs in the album, but her voice sounds natural (more than in any other of her albums) and you can tell her feelings and vulnerability in some of the songs like the Sia co-written track &#34;Perfume&#34; (about being cheated by her boyfriend) and the ballad &#34;Don't cry&#34; which WILL make you cry.<br /><br />Some of the best tracks are: Alien, Body ache, Til It's Gone and Work B**ch
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This game is fun but if you don't have a lot of friends that play fb games then it can take quite a long time to progress much. A database of players should be as to interact without using fb.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love anything and everything to do with The Piano Guys!! I've loved Jon Schmidtt since 7th grade and would go to his concerts all the time. Only thing that would make them better is if they visited my new home town :) Love the album and have never been disappointed in all my The Piano Guys purchases.
B0090SI56Y|4.0|We really liked this movie. Very different than other super hero movies. Not the same approach.<br /><br />Based on a graphic novel, this latest Wolverine movie is chock full of action and even romance that was very well crafted by the new director. Hugh Jackman proves, yet again, that he can carry a movie all alone with charisma and totally capture the true essence of the Wolverine of the comics. Gruff and badass, but with a heart.<br /><br />The Silver Samurai angle was also well done, and the ending was a total surprise for us.
B00G32OMF8|1.0|...i gave this one star for scenery....found the storyline totally boring.....while i watched it to the end there was absolutely no redemption.....
B008JFUS28|4.0|This 2nd entry in the Thor franchise was somewhat better in scope than the 1st movie.<br /><br />Although we liked the 1st movie, this one gave us more fantasy elements and having Thor having his Mjolnor hammer full-time, instead of waiting for him to turn into Thor or getting back his hammer.<br /><br />Having the movie goers visiting other realms was a good idea. More action and differing scenes kept one glued to the screen and was never boring. This was a very different movie than any of the other super hero films, like the latest Wolverine was.<br /><br />And in our opinion, both movies worked in that regard.<br /><br />We really enjoyed this fresh take on the Thor mythos, with Loki stealing a lot of scenes and the Dark Elf angle, this Dark World movie was chock full of humor and total blazing action excitement.
B00GX598FO|3.0|the action was fast paced and exciting and it had some funny parts also.I KNEW THE ACTORS FROM THE FIRST ONE SO IT WAS EASY TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON.
B0081KTHEQ|2.0|OK, I had one really good scare in this.  For the most part, this is Daniel Radcliffe walking around, saying one or two words per conversation, and looking as confused about being in this film as you are for watching it.<br /><br />For me one too many &#34;riviting door opening&#34; scenes.  It doesn't really resolve, either.<br /><br />I don't think the British like children very much.  Seems a kid in a Brit film has as bright a future as a red shirt on Star Trek.<br /><br />I can't believe I paid for this nonsense.
0307236722|4.0|I tried several recipes in this book and found them to be accurate.  I like the step-by-step clarity in preparing cakes, cookies and tarts.  I found a gliche in the recipe for pound cake with lemon/apricot glaze.  The cake came out dry and a trifle heavy.  In checking the recipe I noticed milk was not included or any liquid.  I felt that might have caused the dryness.  I will continue to try other recipes in the book.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I saw this in theaters with my husband in 3D and we fell in love. It was gamer nerd heaven :)<br />It is the best gift for Christmas I could think of for him since he kept bugging me for it. It came in looking great and got here faster than I thought it would.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas CD this year. The Piano Guys did a great job again!! Anyone would love this CD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read the last two and watched the movies as they came, but this book by far is my favorite. I finished it in three days cause once it gets going there is no stopping. I really hope they do this book justices with the movie.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This is really great! I listened to it for a month straight. :) It has a lot of my favorite Christmas songs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a fun game!  It is challenging yet not exasperating and the price is so reasonable.  Great game for both myself and the kids.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I loved this book! It's the reason i'm still reading the series.I loved the story line of a vampire who had to go to a dentist because he broke his fang on a blow-up doll! I'm reading &#34;The Vampire with the DragonTattoo&#34; right now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really did enjoy this book, the action and suspense of the story keep you turning pages.  The characters are all interesting and when you get to know them in book one, you just must move along through the next two books.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great series of movies.  One leads directly into the next one.  Well worth watching!  Would recommend this film series to anyone who likes sci-fi.
B009LDD1X0|2.0|Jim Parson's quirky embodiment of &#34;Sheldon Cooper&#34; will always make the first two or three seasons of this show treasurable. But now that so much of each 20-minute episode is being dissipated on a now-complete set of romantic counterparts, THE BIG BANG THEORY has effectively become FRIENDS WITH PhD'S. In Season 6's systematic couplings, we even lose the comic conceit of Howard and Raj's wonderfully ambiguous on-again/off-again &#34;eratz homosexual&#34; relationship, which I found far more amusing than yet another lame story-line about yet another dysfunctional Romeo. In previous years, I rushed to buy these sets as soon as they came out. After watching Season Five, I waited this year until I could buy the The Sixth Season for less than $20. After fast-forwarding through so many episodes, I won't buy another. Good-bye Sheldon! Thank you for your Seasons One, Two and Three!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good recount of a historical moment in our country's history as well as a glimpse into the life of a navy seal.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has levels that make you think you could never get passed them. but the urge to try again and again makes you come back time after time to finish that level. And that is interesting to me. and its fun.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Pacific Rim is predictable, has a lousy plot, and is pretty much just a mix of independence day and power rangers.  Not worth watching!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Such a good show. I've lent this out so many times, I don't even remember who has it. Fantastic presentation in Blu-ray.
0553565915|5.0|This book is great.  I strongly believe that is tells the true story.  I red it couple of times and would read it again.  I would highly recommend it.
1607066017|5.0|A dynamic duo of writing and art. Was hooked at first issue and can't wait to see where it goes. Take a chance on this series and you won't be disappointed.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|It seemed to be working great, then I started to notice speedups and slow downs.  It was NOT the tape, it was the deck.  Unfortunately, I had to redo a number of tapes with a different deck because I had thought it was the tapes' defect, not the deck, then realized it was the deck.  The company was very helpful in sending a replacement, and when that didn't work, they refunded my money.
B003U21TBO|5.0|I only started watching Dr. Who because it was free here on Amazon, but i have to admit that I would have paid for it if I knew how good it really was. Great stories, writing, and characters make this show one of the best sci-fi shows out there. I just finished watching the Season 5 episode &#34;Vincent and the Doctor&#34; and I have to say that the last ten minutes was maybe the most joyous and, at the same time, heartbreaking ten minutes of any show I have ever watched. It was so beautifully written and acted, that I, admittedly, couldn't help but cry my eyes out. I highly recommend this show to any sci-fi lover out there.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I loved it.  It wasn't what I expected and that's what I liked about it.  The story is gripping and you will find yourself wondering what will happen next.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really fun game!! &acirc;&yen; It can be kind of difficult... but thats what makes it fun, right?! I feel so smart while playing it. (&atilde;&acirc;&atilde;&frac14;&acirc;&atilde;)&atilde;<br />This is an awesome game! I promise~!
B00FY2N81W|5.0|Great action with good and sad surprises. One of the best in the series! We will all miss you Paul!!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I so totally love these guys!  Their music is always a fresh and original interpretation of a familiar piece.  It is upbeat and makes me smile inside and out.  This Christmas album is everything I expected from them.  I listen to it over and over and don't get sick of it.  They may very well be the next Mannheim Steamroller with their unique approach to instrumental music.  And, as if that wasn't good enough, their videos (available on YouTube) are always so stinkin' much fun!  I discovered them on Facebook with a hilarious tribute to the original Star Wars movies and I have been hooked ever since.  Thanks, Piano Guys!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Struggled through the ending to this trilogy. I do appreciate the ending twist though and is a hard lesson that everyone needs to learn. Ok writing overall. This book was the weakest of the three is keeping attention and keeping the story moving.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie - engaging actors, lots of action - we thought it was just a bunch of kids, but saw an interview with Jennifer Lawrence and decided to check it out. Now, my husband and I are looking forward to the sequel!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great sequel. Not a genre for everyone being dystopian.  Love the strong heroine leading the story and not swooning over either of her &#34;loves&#34;. Good ideas and characteristics to have young girls aspire to be.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Uniquely written-sad and joyous-a story of the human spirit and how strong it is! I wish there would have been more story to read-I did not want it to end.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazing music for the whole family. Great for little ones who need noise to fall asleep. My baby falls asleep to their music even through teething and when nothing else works. Great tradition to add to the holiday season.
006202406X|5.0|I can't believe I haven't reviewed this book yet. I received it a couple days after it came out and spent a weekend doing nothing but reading it. As the final book in the Divergent series, a lot had to happen to bring everything together. Veronica Roth did not disappoint. The action was faster, the love was stronger, the sacrifices... well, I can't give everything away. From some things I heard on the internet before reading the book, I had a good idea of how things would go for Tris and Tobias... but it didn't go as I thought it would. Overall, I found it to be a satisfying ending to this electrifying series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hands down the best book in the series. Excellent set up for the sequels and initial introduction of majority of the characters.
B00011KHTM|5.0|OK, this is what you order if you have an iMac and want to connect to a second VGA monitor. (Not DVI...white plug).<br /><br />I looked around for the right accessory to do this and this one is the true fit. I didn't want to fool around with third party adapters, so I got it here. I love having a second monitor to put my mail off to one side while I surf the net.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love the area set up in this book and the incredible description of the environment. Such an intricate arena to imagine and accurately describe.  Hated the twist of who gets sent into the games but it may be a necessary evil to further the story and set up for the final book.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read all of the books. My daughter wanted me to go with her to see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire so I felt like I should watch The Hunger Games movie first. Loved it!!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Amazing in 3D! So glad we invested in this one. We were not aware that you have to have a movie rewards membership in order to get the extra music/storybooks but otherwise everything was delivered as expected.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like playing this game, a lot. That's the good - quests are not particularly onerous, very doable. The downside is that as per usual the creators want you to spend money to advance in the game.  I did spend about $5 to buy some &quot;crowns&quot;.  6 days ago I paid my money, 6 days have gone by and I have yet to see my crowns. Still haven't received an answer to my query on the help website. I also noted that others have yet to receive the purchases either. I would not recommend spending any money.
B00948EPOQ|5.0|Great score, lighthearted, well acted and directed with beautiful settings. A very enjoyable romantic comedy that will hold your interest and leave you smiling.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|After reading Ken Follett's first two books in his Century Trilogy, The book thief, although certainly not a light read, is more of a &#34;story.&#34; The characters are well developed and the reader feels a real connection and affection for them, (as does the book's narrator). The story is told from the point of view of a poor German neighborhood in the midst of World War two. Their lives, and every movement that they make is carefully scrutinized and mandated by the Nazi regime. This book made me smile, laugh and yes, cry.  I strongly recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that you guys finally got candy crush saga for the Kindle fire!!! I am so happy it's fabulous! Thank u so much for listening!!! Love the game, absolutely addictive!!! Cannot get enough!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I usually don't rate things usually...especially things that already have over 10k ratings in the first place.  That said, this game deserves every five star rating it has.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Great movie.  Plenty of action and another great 007 movie.  It's not the old James Bond, with technology gadgets, but still worth taking it in.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I got it for my daughter, she loves it!  She loves Joss and his other works.  This along with Ken's version of Much Ado pretty much have all aspects of the play shown in completion.
B00EPFEY44|4.0|THE CD/DVD  RATES FOUR STARS ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THE FULL PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AS WE VIEWED ON OUR LOCAL PBS STATION; HAD IT BEEN IT WOULD DEFINITELY HAD BEEN A FIVE STAR!<br />  NEVER-THE-LESS, IT IS EXCELLENT AND ONE OF HIS BEST COMBINED COLLECTION OF SONGS.  DAVID FOSTER IS A SURE FIRE WINNER TOO!
0316078913|2.0|I just didn't like it.  He's a good writer but it seemed contrived to me.  Someone else michg like it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Missed the first two seasons and it was great to be able to get caught up so I can keep up to date with the series.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|really good plot and well written. I think this book even top &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;. Hard to put down.
1419702238|5.0|My reader is improving his vocabulary and his reading speed.  This book has a young touch that goes along with children.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This was another great Superman movie.  I liked that I got this in 3D also, I love the extra effects of the 3D experience.  I thought this was done well.  A little different take on past Superman movies, but I really enjoyed this one.  It was a family movie night showing and everyone enjoyed this movie!!  Glad I bought this, even more pleased that I spent the small extra expense to get it in 3D.  When you order a 3D per-release movie on Amazon, your guaranteed the lowest price at shipment.  Price almost always drops considerably on release date.  So either order it ahead of release, or wait until the actual release date and get it for less.  When you wait awhile, price seems to increase, depending on the popularity of the movie.  I love the Amazon Prime, because movies come on the date they are released.
0810994739|5.0|It is a great book for any reader.  My son got an award last year on 1st grade for great reader and this books will keep him as the great reader he is
B006H5120E|5.0|Great classic movie.  If your buying this just for the 3D version, it's not done as well as other attempts.  Some of the effects are better, but the people take on a 2D to 3D conversion effect that my LG TV set already does. This can be dizzying to some. My sister couldn't watch this one in 3D.  The movie stands the test of time.  A great, now classic movie.  The blue ray version was indeed better, but the 3D was just ok.  Movie was still great!!  Glad I bought this also.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this books.  He already read one of them.  All books are good, but this books in particular has a young mind for young children.
B008518MOW|5.0|As I said, I like to collect series when they are available.  I ended up getting the first movies in Blue ray, this one had the added experience of a good 3D effect movie.  I loved every one in this series and the original actors are in this one also, along with the new younger version of Tommy Lee Jones character.  A must have for &#34;Men In Black&#34; fans.  Great 3D effects in this movie also, just adds to your viewing home theater experience.
B008JFUO72|3.0|Read other reviews and well I over look major details. &#34;Spoiler&#34; Jarvis can control the suits so why didn't Tony have half, 10 or so watching the house? Why didn't he call Jarvis and have him send a suit to pick him up? Granted Jarvis was down for a bit but why not make that your main goal? Now the suits are drones and well for an Avengers 2, why will they need Tony when he can build and send a suit he drives or just let Jarvis and well send a fleet of suits. Only way to fix that is for some reason Tony has to be in the suit. I enjoyed it but well the rules have changed and not for the better.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|I got this for the 3D, price was good.  I liked the movie, but the original movie was better.  I think you had more character in the Transformers in the first movie.  This was very enjoyable though.  I liked the price and the 3D experience. I paid allot less when I ordered this movie.  I see the price has gone up and not down for this movie now.  The previously viewed are usually just as good, if you get the seller rating as like new.
0525478817|5.0|This book kind of changed my life.<br />As a struggling teen, this book showed me things and explained things that just kind of cleared up my life. I've read this book several times (cover to cover in one sitting every time)<br />This book gives me hope.<br />I may be reading into things, but TFioS will be a classic.<br />John Green is definitely a favorite.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Another of my many 3D animated movies.  I really enjoyed the 3D effects in this movie, along with a very cute, Eco friendly story.  A great Dr. Seuss' tale.  The animation was by the same people who made &#34;Despicable Me&#34;, I loved it and the color and 3D effects were well worth getting this movie in 3D also.  Blue ray is great also, but the 3D does really add to this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play it all the time.  I'm addicted to it as are others I've talked to.  I'm stuck on game 105.  They really get hard as the games progress.  I've started from the beginning on my kindle and its just whizzing by.
B00E00PM40|5.0|Loved this animated tale!  The whole family will like this one.  Especially the Child at heart people, like me.  I enjoyed the animation, and the 3D was really good also.  Just enough to add to some of the beautiful art work effects.  I enjoyed this movie and sent the DVD in the Combo Pack to my Grandson.  I like that their is a digital copy to also enjoy or download for travel.  This would be great to entertain the children, or grandchildren during long trips.  The 3D splashes out some and the effects are really enhanced with the 3D version.  I like having the 3D when it's a good one, just adds to my Cinema experience at home.
B006T3RM08|5.0|it is one of the nicest gadget i have for imac, it is worth every dollar.<br /><br />slick design, excellent quality.<br /><br />great product
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|If you love the Alien series, you have to have the beginning.  I loved the movie and got this in 3D for the effects.  To tell you the truth, I was a little too frightened with the original movies.  This one had you on the edge of your seat, but with a great beginning story and great 3D effects.  You can't have Segordney Weaver in this movie, it was about the beginning of the Aliens, before she was born.  I'm older now than when &#34;Aliens&#34; were released.  I seem to be able to watch this one now, still the grab your seat and jump feeling, but I loved the movie.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game! However finished it in a couple hours. That being said it was the only negative comment  I have. Bring us more like this one G5!
B005IZLPME|5.0|Great movie, great in 3D also.  I wanted this to add to my Marvel Avengers movies.  Such a collection freak, and movie buff that I am.  I thought the original character and story was well depicted here. Really enjoyed this movie.  Good 3D experience also, just enhanced the picture.  I like that this was a 3-Disc set, price on this one was good also.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Gameplay is solid, graphics are really nice and game runs smooth.  The achievement system adds a nice twist with some odd and challenging requests.  All in all I'd say this is one of the best freecell games I've ever played.  No intrusive permissions or ads or IAP is a welcome change from the faotd that have shown up recently.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|Great child's movie, for those who love animated children's movies and have a child, or a child in yourself.  I think your kids will love this movie.  This is like a Car's, but with Planes.  I did like the story line, and movie was enjoyable for myself and even my husband.  Cute innocent humor.  I bought this in 3D, just made it a little better.  The 3D was good, but not much better than the 2D would be.  The animation art is so realistic in animated movies now, but the 3D is still a little better than the 2D.  I enjoyed the added effects of the 3D, but I like watching the new 3D, when done well.  This was nice enough not to make you dizzy, but just to add to the whole picture experience.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Graphics are nice but the game does not respond quick enough.  This was a let down it could have been good.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|I can't believe this album got such good ratings. It is by far his worst. I grew up on Eminem but I don't think I can relate much to his music anymore. Recovery was okay but this album is half as good at best. I respect Recovery because I could tell he was trying to make positive changes in his life. For example, he wanted to diss Lil Wayne but then ended up putting him on the album instead. I don't understand why he named this album like he's just trying to feed off his past success. If he wanted to &#34;revisit&#34; he should have called it The Eminem LP. In my opinion I would say SSLP was his best work followed by MMLP then Encore.
0060936223|4.0|Fascinating! Patti Smith writes her own intriguing story very well.  As she seems to do most everything else.  She and Steve Martin worry me with their multi-talentedness, set a too-daunting example.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Once again, The Piano Guys hit the mark for great music that is enjoyable to hear, fun to experience and, is great to listen to over and over! Thanks Guys!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Old game but if you've played one Pac man then you've played them all.  Would be entertaining to some children.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Well done! Beautiful music encouraging and inspiring. Thanks for GREAT MUSIC that has encouraged my son to keep practicing his piano lessons. Makes me want to take them up again!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Arguably the best game ever, and is the greatest game I have ever played.  There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.  This is a Vita seller and if you have a Vita you must buy this game.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The way these guys put classical and modern music together is great! It makes me want to learn the cello!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The product was sent according to the specifications and very carefully. I strongly recommend this vendor.  Thank s a lot!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Playing on kindle fire is better than on FB in my opinion. I like this game a lot, not as addicted as some people i know though!! I only give 4 stars for it cutting you off so fast, making you wait a certain # of mins to play again, without getting lives from friends. I use to get requests from fb friends &amp; i just find it annoying. Just let me play the game!
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|This review is a little late, as I got this about a week ago. I tried to cope with not writing one about the shipping and packaging, but it finally got to me.<br /><br />I love the Rebuild series much more than the original Neon Genesis Evangelion show much more, mainly because both the original ending and End of Evangelion, in my opinion, were terrible. The rebuild gives much more satisfaction on how the story progresses with renewed animations and (for the most part) a new plot.<br /><br />The shipping time was amazing. Bought the standard of 3-5 business days and received it in 2 days, much quicker than anticipated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to give this a 4/5 star rating. If I were rating the movie alone, I would have definitely rated it 5 stars in a heartbeat, but...<br /><br />How the DVD was shipped was disappointing. The box used was quite larger than the DVD cases themselves, which is normal and fine. What wasn't fine was they used a really terrible form of packaging / wrapping. There were 3 small pouches of bubble wrap on top, one which was already popped. There was no type of bubble wrap protecting the sides and corners of the cases. (IE: The case didn't lunge forward or backwards, but slid all around the box. I confirmed this by putting in Finding Nemo. The case is the same measurement and I re-wrapped it using the same methods, shook the box for about 10 seconds, and got the same results as when I first opened the package.) The case came dented on all corners of the case, the clear wrap around the box was partially torn open (very small, but still). One of the corners of the DVD case when i pulled out of the shipping box was also torn.<br /><br />To most people, this isn't a big deal. They'll probably even argue with me that I should get over it, it's not that big of a deal, etc. I'm not one of those people and these types of things bug me greatly. I believe that if you're going to ship out a product, it should be done properly. I'm happy the DVDsthemselves are in perfect condition, but having the case like this makes me quite angry. Please use better packaging in the future.
B00EEDNA4M|2.0|I am very sad that this is only available in Blu-ray.  I don't have Blu-Ray and was dying to buy this collection when it came out.  I am very disappointed.  Any chance this could be made in a regualr format so I can buy this??
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The horrors of WWII from the perspective of the Germans, innocents and villains alike...and sometimes just bystanders unwilling or unable to get involved...as told by Death, himself.  The book illuminates the best and worst of humanity just like most wars do.  I found it disturbing and often times wanted to stop reading it. I'm glad I resisted that urge...it was worth the time it took to read
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Excellent.  Stryper have surpassed themselves and peers.  Who would've thought at this point in time something so inspired could come from any band, thank you Stryper for doing it!  Songs I didn't care as much for initially are becoming favorites.  It seems other 80's bands recent attempts fail by either trying to fit in with a current music style or merely following a blueprint of the glory days sound and still fail as it's uninspired.  The production is great.  Maybe Michael could help other bands find a better sound. Thank you guys.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|First time playing it, great game. Always going to play it on my spare time. Will recommend it to my friends.
B00DQVST76|3.0|I have all Madonna's DVD concerts, this one's sound was the most overlayed dubed in vocals of the few. I didnt like that, the concert itself was ok..in a true diva way. I alway want to see the dancer's on how they adutitions for the gig,and this didnt do it. It show's alittle but to much editing.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I grew up in the mid to late 90's and I remember rushing home so I could watch Gundam Wing, Mobile Suit  Gundam The 08th Team, and Mobile Fighter G Gundam. It was so cool to see giant robots zooming around blowing stuff up and saving us puny fragile humans. This reminded me so much of those days being a little kid sitting in front of the TV watching my favorite show. Raleigh and Mako reminded me of the past pilots I saw in Gundams. Maybe not the strongest or the toughest but they had that will to win to protect their friends and planet.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|The trial was as realistic as any I have read. I was a trial lawyer for 38 years. This is a very well written story.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This is what a well thought out and endorsed Halo movie could've been like. To see things come to life of a universe I've only seen in the games or had in my head as I read the books was glorious. I just wish it would've gone on longer and had more episodes even if they only became webisodes they could've tied us over until the new Halo TV series (which I also cant wait for) comes out. If you're a old hand at Halo buy it and watch it you wont be disappointed especially if you pare it up with Halo Legends. If you're new and wondering what the Halo universe is about watch Halo Legends first then come back and buy this one.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Surely a distressing story. War is evil. I was in one. The smell, the smell. It sure my will never end.
B00D6M86RS|4.0|Fun game but the graphics are a tad odd, especially the spinning pinballs.  Otherwise, enjoyable enough to have played it more than a few times.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I love this movie, is nspirational but the problem is that the storyline is most a lie. You should read history and you'll see that the characters are not so real with their performances. The point is that being a fantasy (that's how i call it) the movie is great, that's all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever get it right now I promise it is the best game I ever I play it night and day
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I only recently began reading for leisure for the first time since I was a schoolboy. This title did not disappoint! I was immediately enthralled by this fictional world Gaiman introduces the reader to. Could not recommend enough!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|After a fantastic first book and then a tedious and melodramatic second book, I was a bit worried about this one.  It didn't disappoint!  Nonstop action and a great twist.  Well done.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|These characters are all too real, all too damaged. Interesting to see where the plot leads. Heavy focus on the lead characters.
B000SW4DV2|4.0|This is my 6 year old Grandsons review. He liked it a lot but said he would not give it a 5 start because it was so much like another movie he had watched. I wished he remembered the movie,
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Because it is a fun action game and you con unlock new people and have fun playing this game and you  can upgrade you people and making them stronger ,
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Amazing writing  --details that set you squarely into the time and characters that will haunt your dreams. It is not a fast read but compelling.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this game is fun and made for horse lovers like me! It is also a very addictive game!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Everything they do is amazing.  Love The Piano Guys, so glad they made a Christmas CD.  It's music I enjoy as much as my kids!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Didn't like playing it without controllers.  Though it brought back memories when the game was popular.  My children were young than.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The puzzles are challenging but not so difficult that I can' t solve the puzzle eventually. The soft music adds a relaxing touch.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Its fund to play with my grandson.  My grandson actually showed me how to play and helped me get passed certain stages of the game.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|Am I the only one who finds this app boring and uninteresting? Games go far too slow and it just fails to keep you entertained.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|Excellent story line, certainly possible in real life and it was a clean movie (meaning lack of poor language, etc.) which is hard to find these days.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Katniss is a bit changed from who she was in the first part, not the coincidental killer, but the more premeditated. I rated 4 because she throws to many fits like a whiny b... The story is very good and l am sure leads to a better part 3.<br />RECOMMEND IT.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Okay, I think we all know the Amazon version of this app no longer works and I found a couple other stores you can use to get the Google play version of kik. Go to your silk browser and search either 1mobile app store or aptoide app store. Those are both external stores that give off apps that won't work for your store and apps you want to update but it only came out to other stores. Hope I helped you guys out ;)<br /><br />Click the yes button under the review so others can see this!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A Game of Thrones: A song of Ice and Fire: Book One is very well written.  For those who have seen the series, you will find that the series follows the books very closely.  Both have the same feel.  Highly recommended.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Already a great movie, now has all the stuff that comes with it! It was delivered in record time! And it came protected and perfect! The person I got this for is going to FREAK!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Fresh from the concert at Durham Performing Arts Center, we could not wait to get some Piano Guys Christmas music!  We don't have to worry about whether cheesy lyrics have replaced original ones and can just enjoy the music of the season in the purest form!  Our whole family loves Piano Guys!  A wonderful addition to your holiday music library.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's personal experience and totally objective opinion as a neurosrgeon make for a very dramatic and convincing read.  In my life, I view the technology of modern wireless communications as my reference to the the existence of God.  We can't see these electronic impulses that come from a satellite, tower then to our cell phone, but we know they're there, passing through us constantly.  Dr. Alexander was brain dead, yet he lived in a Heavenly state just long enough for our God to prove to him, He exists in another diminsion of time of and space.  If you doubt Heaven exists, this book is a &#34;must read&#34; as yet another convincing story of how our minds can't comprehend the magnitude, wonder and grace of God.  Yes, Heaven is real and this man's journey from a lifeless body in the realm of Heavan, gives proof to it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|love this game. lots of entertainment. It is a very addictive game. When I start its so hard to put down and walk away.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent little dongle, easy-to-use, working flawlessly - all at a price that is hard to beat. We already have multiple across the house.<br /><br />There is growing number of streaming options that natively support Chromecast, including Netflix, HBO Go, YouTube, Google Play, etc in their respective players (web or mobile apps) through the Chromecast icon. The interesting aspect of the native support is that Chromecast itself actually connects to the streaming provider directly. In other words, at that point there is NO streaming going on between your phone/tablet/laptop and Chromecast. You can easily shutdown/work/or do other things. No quality impact either, obviously, that would be caused by your device. Simple and extremely effective.<br /><br />The other use-case is the \\"casting\\" (streaming) of tabs from within the Chrome browser. As other reviewers noted, in that scenario the performance is really depending on your device's performance and the content you are casting. Still a very nice feature that comes in handy quite often. Especially if you want to share web pages ad-hoc.And with a growing number of native support options, there is less and less need to use that option for casting video but rather use it for web page sharing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are a true King fan for the right reasons, you will love it too. As always, the characters are deep and the mental penetration deeper.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I am a sucker for power packs.  I own several of them, and this may be the last one I get for a long time.  I LOVE the size and shape of this.  It easily fits into a pocket, it is very convenient to travel around with, and it packs a lot of juice in such a small package.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!
B000KIPT30|4.0|Use this in our podcast studio.  We needed the extra outputs for guest headphones.  This works just fine.  Plenty of &#34;gain&#34; or &#34;headroom&#34;.  Use it through Sennheiser HD280's.  Exactly what we needed at a low price.  Would have rated it 5 stars if it had 1/8&#34; AND 1/4&#34; connectors like some other companies.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Useless application except if you want to air all your thoughts forever to anyone who figures out who you are. Stupid use for anything other than advertising and showing off...... remember, in the end, anyone will eventually get your data.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely adore The Piano Guys. By far my favorite Christmas album ever. And I was thrilled to get the DVD too. I actually love the fireplace with the music because we don't have a fireplace in our house. Keep it up and I can't wait for more!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|I love this game it is really fun and my sister really really likes it too. This game is really good for kids.
B00FQ53NIA|4.0|I was never a Brittney Spears fan.<br /><br />Two reasons: First, she was &#34;replacing&#34; Madonna. Madonna already did it and she did it better. Of course, Madonna followed in the steps of Grace Jones, Deborah Harry, and others. Just as now we have Lady Gaga and Katy Perry following behind Spears and Christine Aguilera, who followed Madonna and Cyndi Lauper who followed Harry and Jones who followed Cher. Gaga and Perry will be followed, as well.<br /><br />Second, I just couldn't stand Spears voice. All of her music sucked, poor songs with poor singing. Well, I did like the song &#34;Lucky.&#34; Perhaps some of this perception is also due to her not being Madonna. Every Madonna single and album were events! It was exciting! It was the 80's! What do these punk kids know about anything, least of all good pop music?<br /><br />Then the song &#34;Womanizer&#34; came out. I liked it. I couldn't stop listening to it. So, I went against all my instincts and purchased the &#34;Circus&#34; album. I liked the whole album. It moved away from the pop sound to a more electronic dance sound, slicker and better produced.<br /><br />So, (sigh), I became a fan of Spears. But, to be perfectly clear, I still can't stand her early music and I don't think she would sound good live without an autotuner and other manipulations.<br /><br />Today, I purchased her new album Britney Jean. Shut up. I am enjoying it.<br /><br />This one is different. It has better producers and you can hear it, it's not quite as cookie cutter in the loops and vocal manipulation as her previous two albums. will.i.am is the executive producer and William Orbit puts his touch on the opening track, Alien (my favorite of the set).<br /><br />I have two complaints.<br /><br />First is &#34;Til It's Gone&#34; is basically a repeat of a previous song. For example the &#34;fa-a- a-ce&#34; and other spots where it re-re-repeats is the same as on her song &#34;I Wanna Go&#34; from her last album.<br /><br />My secondcomplaint is the duet with Spears sister Jamie Lynn Spears, &#34;Chillin' With You.&#34; Too cheesy. Sounds like a song you would hear in a Glee episode or some horrible Disney or TeenNick show.<br /><br />The album starts off stronger than it ends.<br /><br />Compared to recent new releases by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Cher, Spears is much better than Gaga's and Perry's, but not as good as Cher's. Gaga's voice is stronger and more versatile than Spears. Like Perry and Gaga, Spears wrote or contributed to the writing of every song on the album. Something Spears, Perry and Gaga lack is Cher's coolness, Cher's legendary status, Cher's ability to cover different styles of pop. I mean, Cher has been doing what they are doing since their parents were the age of their fans. Cher was doing it before the people they are merely following were standing on a stage. They may each sell more of their new album than Cher sells of hers, but Cher's is still better.<br /><br />Those who dislike Spears no matter what she does or how she does it will dislike this album. It will just confirm the continuing downward spiral or contemporary pop music.<br /><br />Those who love Spears and every thing she touches will find this album to be her best ever. It will justify their hanging in there with her.<br /><br />Those who like some songs, but maybe not all, will like some of the songs on this album. They will probably agree it is her best produced album, not necessarily one of the albums we will be talking about in 25 years from now.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great greatest  I would love it if you get a free firelight sparkle if we got all of our ponies to 5 star
B008CP6RWU|5.0|While these games are much shorter than your usual playthroughs, the beautiful music & graphics keep you immersed in theses simple worlds. They're more about the beauty around you & natural curiosity than anything else. I recommend them for anyone who is looking for something completely new in the world of gaming.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Awkward tackles its thorny issues-of-the-week, A show that I would recommend to show my kids to let them know whatthings were like before and why change should always be for the better.
B000022TSW|5.0|This DVD includes the classic South Park humor. Matt & Trey take the town to a new level in this feature-length movie. It's great for fans of the series or anyone who doesn't feel like buying all the seasons.
0812550706|3.0|This iscAwkward tackles its thorny issues-of-the-week, with such garish and gamy exaggeration you can't help but cringe while laughing and laugh while cringing.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a great gift / addition to any 'The Legend of Zelda' fan! The art is stunning, & the timeline descriptions are something fans have been waiting for years to be explained in more detail.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Great movie that had me wishing I was somewhere else that would be the best. Who says reviews are important
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This DVD is great for a girls' movie night or anytime you feel like watching a feel good, sentimental romance. Keanu & Sandra should make movies together more often. :)
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is an easy way to challenge your mind but much more fun than a boring old puzzle book. I love this game.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved this series when it aired on TV, & was so excited to hear it was finally being released on DVD! It's just as good as I remember it! Both movies come with this complete series & are a great collection for anyone who wants to laugh at how dumb high school was.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|This is a truly funny and great movie...except for the language.  I don't know why they have to put in all the x rated words because this is a great movie without all the cussing.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I was so excited when I heard they were releasing an extended version of this movie. The bonus features are great, & the movie itself is charming. It makes you forget that it's been over a decade since 'Lord of the Rings' came out!
B008JFUPZI|5.0|This movie is actually great. After seeing the 12% on Rotten Tomatoes and having read and seen many negative reviews myself I expected the worst. If get over the whole &#34;It's basically Men in Black&#34; thing this movie turns out to be a lot of funny. The two lead work great together. Kevin Bacom provides a good bad guy. You are never bored for a second with this movie. Don't believe the critics. It's their job to find something wrong with the movies. Otherwise we wouldn't need them. At least rent it, if you don't wanna blind buy like I did. Even the effects are great. (Except for one Car which looks like an unfinished effects shot, but that's only visible for a second or so). But really. you have a lot at stake in the story, interesting people, a few good laughs and plenty of action. What do you want more? Oh and btw: The Blu Ray is really excellent picture and Soundwise. The DTS HD Master 7.1 Tracks is really something to show your system off. I know Universil will probably never make it's money back. Even they would deserve it for trying something new. Like I siad, if you get over the similarities to another franchise you have nothing to worry about but good times.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|My mother is a big Nirvana fan, & she loves these live DVDs. The band wasn't around for very long in comparison to some. These concerts are a great way to relive the best of the 90s.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Great Singer, great songs. If you like this style of music you need this in your library and the online price is very reasonable.
B005EXA8XC|5.0|My mother is a big Nirvana fan, & she loves these live DVDs. The band wasn't around for very long in comparison to some. These concerts are a great way to relive the best of the 90s.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This. Is a fun multilevel game with 2 levels of expertise.  The game  presents  you with opportunity to score on additional puzzles to earn more stars at the end of each level.  Use the stars  to gain special powers that up your chances to score.  Went through it on the normal level and now going through the expertise level.  The graphics are absolutely lovely on my Kindle Fire 7 HD.
0706411501|5.0|If you're a fan of Jane Austin or just a fan of classics in general, you'll enjoy this collection. All of her best works are brought together in one volume for enjoying.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love this game it is fun and addictive. I was not keen on spending the money at first after the free trial but it has been worth every penny and I am very glad I spent the moment on it.
0316219266|2.0|For a man as smart and interesting as Jeff Bezos I found this book exceedingly tedious and boring. I only made it about 25 pages and I was skimming through those. It was obvious the author never interviewed Bezos. So, I turned the book around and sold it on Amazon. How great is that!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Beautiful range of music, from peaceful and serene to festive and joyous. Perfect to keep the true essence of Christmas alive amidst the busyness and chill of winter!
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Great Tv series action packed with little history mixed in. Can't beat vikings and recommend anyone who likes action to watch this TV series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first, book is so much better that it ruined the movie for me.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Definitely a solid book that helps you understand clearly the important role that habit plays in our life. If we can change our habits we can change our results. I recommend it but was expecting a bit more from the book. Maybe more practical tools would have been helpful. The stories and visuals are memorable.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just when you start to get into the game you're forced to stop. So then you move on to another game. Big mistake by developer. You don't allow people enough time to get hooked.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm happy to have it on my Kindle it works a little slow sometimes but overall pretty good. Innuendos hdvsvwhshd
B008JFUPOY|5.0|3D VERSION IS THE BEST !!! THAT IS WHAT I BOUGHT.  ANIMAL HOUSE OF CHILDREN'S MOVIES. PG RATING IS DESERVED.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|WOW!  What a great episode!  I'm barely going to be able to wait for Feb. 14.  How do they all get back together?  Is Judith really dead?  Where do they go?  I'm going to have to get my fix with the PS3 games and the Rise of the Governor/Fall of the Governor Books (Which are awesome, btw).
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is kind of addictive like most of these games are. The storage is quite annoying that it is so small and requires upgrading, but as 'll in all is ok
B005AKFXZW|2.0|The world that Morgenstern created is so exquisite that it should have been easy for her to create a good story. The Night Circus could have been a story of intrigue and manipulation, unfortunately it wasn’t mysterious at all, it was just vague, and I did not connect to any of the characters. This book had so much potential but was disappointing.<br /><br />A duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors.<br />I did not see any duels and for what purpose ? Just because that question is never answer  doesn’t make it mysterious or intriguing.<br /><br />This book reminded me of fairy floss, it looks amazing, it sounds so interesting,  but as you munch into it,  it just dissipates. I could not get a grip on the night circus,  it kept tantalising me with wonderful descriptions and possibilities but it did not deliver.  I spent most of the book a bit confused.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to reading the book as it sounded so much fun, and so intriguing, I loved the concept.  It reminded me of a painting that was blurry and I just could not see it well, But I knew it could be a really good painting.<br /><br />After reading the book, I checked out the star rating and it did have a lot of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, stars,  and I have found when that happens the tops stars are often paid for, this may not be true in this case but I have found it that way previously.<br /><br />I really don't have anymore to say about it, except I enjoy the descriptive scenes and particularly the clock which was amazing.
0316204366|3.0|I read Outliers for my first Gladwell book, and it sets the bar extremely high. This book fell short of that expectation is all.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I had an audio version of this book and I really am not use to listening to books and wonder if my perception of the book may have been different if I had actually read each page.<br />I loved the book and found the characters interesting and the complexities of the plot very entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|The flexibility of choosing translations and the other user/reader friendly features such as daily reading with book marks.  Font size is critical for my aging eyes.
B009C7JS14|5.0|After trying several weather apps I decided on keeping this one. I love the easy to read page with all I need to know about my area. And it works when I am out of wi-fi range.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|When it came in I could not stop watching it and when I was done I was ready for the next one. Awesome series!
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is so much fun. And it's not just for kids. I take it to work and have fun with my co-workers.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Easy to use & it's a game that has different varieties to capture any body's interest who like to put puzzle together
B0030B1WBM|5.0|The movie was great.  Unfortunately, closed caption start running about 2/3 of the way through the movie.  It was not even sinked with the movie.  It was not any equipment fault on our end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging and lots of fun! Some levels more difficult than others. Wish it would save game where you left off.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|My son has got me hooked on this app. I look forward to catching up to my little general. The tutorial at each step are very helpful . We have enjoyed the planning and building aspects of this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far my favorite book of the three. I couldn't stop reading. A MUST read. The most amazing book ever
B003L77G06|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. We watch the shows over and over! It is a popular show for a family to watch together.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is so awesome with headphones/ear buds.It really takes you away and it has a nice variety.  I use it for meditation and background noise, its awesome!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It works fine, I just wanted a few more features. Would recommend this for a general wake up alarm.  It was easy to download.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Can't get enough of this game...I love it. One of the best hunting games out there for kindle... I would play this ever chance I get and no complaints here. Great job.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Like this alarm clock a lot! I left my cell phone at work that I normally use for my alarm.  I needed an alarm for my Kindle to insure I was up on time for work, and church.  This worked great!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|This was a gift for my dad. He loves the movie & has watched it several times already. Plays well, no skipping.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I like the cloud.  It works well for me.  Knowing I can access my photos anywhere at anytime is just awesome!  No more pulling out wallets, or photo albums for me!
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Great, unique stuff<br />definitely not the regular poppy stuff as the first album was, but it's really intertesting music and I personally love it.<br />Particularly the song \\"Schiese\\"
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is my &#34;Go To&#34; spot for definitions.  Works well on my Kindle.  Would recommend it for any tablet user.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Though we had watched this movie many times before, we decided to finally purchase it as it has become a favorite around Christmas time. Now the whole family can enjoy watching it anytime they want
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I picked up this book around the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination. I couldn't put it down! Stephen King takes us back into the late 1950s, early 1960s, when America was a different place. Accidental-time traveler Jacob Epping (alias George Amberson) stumbles upon the &#34;rabbit hole,&#34; a mysterious portal that brings him from 2011 back to 1958 America. Armed with knowledge from the future, he travels back to the obdurate past to change the event that has come to define the Baby Boomer generation: the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />Mr. King blends the right amount of supernatural with realism to make this a large, page-turning thriller. His time-travel theme lets the reader wonder what he or she would do if put in the same position. How do you change the past when it doesn't want to change? Especially when the &#34;butterfly effect&#34; may nullify any good intentions you may have? This book will make you think about aspects of time travel you may not have thought about before.<br /><br />If the JFK assassination fascinates you, or perhaps you enjoy time travel and/or thrillers, then I highly recommend this novel.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|Seether is always awesome. Seether has an awesome song. The band is one of the best bands. They put together an awesome album. They are all talented men. I am glad I bought the album. Seether 2002-2013 exceeded my expectations.
B008JDAC7G|1.0|awfull.... full of spyware.... rarely works right. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Adult swim dropped the ball on this one. check out Major Mayhem.
0375413405|5.0|Isn't is self explanatory?  Everyone needs this cookbook on their shelf.  I look at it over and over and am going to try so many things!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Simply put, if you want a glimpse of what it's like living in a Socialist state, watch this movie and you will get a good idea. Based on life in what used to be Socialist East Germany, it is a story about the activities of the Stasi (secret police) and how they monitored anyone and everyone who disagreed with, or spoke out against, the government...then took sanctions against those people.<br />It also reveals how under such a government, control of the people is the ultimate goal, and is accomplished through propaganda and the &#34;re-inventing&#34; of anything that poses a threat to the state.<br /><br />The actors were outstanding in their roles, especially those playing Stasi officers and how, regardless of what occupational level you are in this type society, even the &#34;watchers&#34; of others are being watched.<br />This comes about in the form of a Stasi officer who begins to feel empathy towards his targets, something his superiors eventually pick up on.<br /><br />Of course, anyone who has studied history would know this is actually more &#34;literary license&#34; than fact since real-life Stasi officers had no empathy towards the people they investigated. The mere fact you were being investigated meant you were subversive, period.<br /><br />Although in subtitles, the plot line and dramatic sequences are easy to follow and do not subtract from understanding what is occurring. They also do not interfere with how well a job the actors do of interacting with each other.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this movie as a form of dramatic entertainment as well as one that could be used in an academic environment to show what happens when government controls the people instead of it being the other way around.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are artists that I feel great supporting.  All of their music is fun, smart, and addictive.  Their Christmas cd is no different.  Love the Piano Guys!

B00AEBEQW8|4.0|Very creative book! Seems to go inside each color's brain and brings out what each one is thinking and feeling. My 6 year old enjoyed every page and loved to discover what each crayon was thinking, even felt sorry for some of them and tried to figure out ways to make up to them! Great book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Another superb offering from The Piano Guys...CD constantly in the car, DVD will be used extensively during the Christmas season - especially when we put the tree up.
B001KZG99A|3.0|It was a good movie but I do not really like super hero movies. it was an okay movie though.
B00G922EA2|4.0|I like hidden object games. This one was fun and kept me busy trying to figure out the puzzles. G5 always has good games!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Pop-rock perfection<br /><br />Everything about this album is pop- perfection. It's actually an ALBUM-- songs flow nicely, weaves a story, not just a bunch of singles. Actually has meaning
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Extremely talented guys!  Love all that they do...and this Christmas collection does not disappoint.  The classic and contemporary blend the Piano Guys bring is such a welcome change from all the other &#34;celebrity&#34; Christmas music productions.  Thank you for bringing &#34;Christmas&#34; back into the music.
B00FGWTOBI|4.0|Before I begin my review, I want to provide an important (hopefully helpful) alert. Amazon has a policy of grouping all the reviews of ALL configurations of CD and DVD products. So reviews of the single CD edition of the “Frozen” soundtrack are mixed with the TWO-disc “Deluxe version. You will find the reviews combined. So it is important to look on each review that you read to see which edition is being reviewed. With that said, this is a review of the Single-CD version.<br /><br />Even though it is only one CD – this disc clocks in at over 62 minutes! Often record labels release separate CDs of the “score (the part that the orchestra plays behind the action on the screen ) and the “songs” which are either sung by the actors/characters or played over the end credits (which in an animated film can now run as long as eight minutes!).  This Cd combines both. And – thoughtfully – they put all the vocals up front and the “score” after that. So for the first 21 minutes you hear what can best describe as “Broadway pop” songs by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel (Tony winner for “Wicked”) and others in the cast, plus the reprise of the films “hit single” – “Let It Go” – as performed by Demi Lovato. (Menzel sings it five tracks earlier. Then for the next 42 minutes you get the orchestral score, which consists of short pieces.  The true Disney fan will love the whole album but, I’m afraid that the “teen audience” who will be drawn to the pop hits at the beginning, will find the score pretty boring - it’s a whole lot less upbeat and often dramatic – and press the stop button.  So just be aware of that.<br /><br />I have not seen the film (yet) so I can’t visualize the scenes that accompany the music and songs, but I did enjoy listening to the album.<br /><br />The single CD comes with a 20-page booklet with the lyrics to the “songs” , a track list and a page with the names of every orchestra member. (It’s a big orchestra so grab a magnifying glass if you want to read each member’s name.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”grab a magnifying glass if you want to read each member’s name.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Awesome... Arrived on time...packaged perfectly...Superior quality. Came with a cool book of picture from the set. You should buy this if you like these movies.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|one of the best live recorded concerts of the Eagles, back in 1977, when they were still young and energetic...
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|Everything is ok, delivery date was as expected, the product is exactly what I want, is working fine and is very good.
B003JA5NVE|5.0|Great acting - good plot development - held my interest throughout 7 seasons.  Lots of humor and plenty of drama as well...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game rocks I think you should get it I meen if you like arcade games then you should get this game.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Lots of valuable, new information in this book  Excellent recipes.  Excellent reasons for slowing down on carbs. Great book to have available on your Kindle app. for reference anytime!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!! I was so happy when it came out for kindle fire. I just can't seem to put it down...LOVE it!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It takes a few pages to realize that Death is the narrator of this book...but after a while you understand that seeing humanity through the eyes of Death in war torn Nazi Germany is not only haunting, it is right.  Liesel, Rudy, Max, Papa and Rosa spring to life, capture your heart and you'll find yourself hoping against hope that they never meet Death.  But in the midst of the violence, the insanity, the starvation and the senseless cruelty of anti-Semitism, Death makes sense, becomes a friend.  Then there are those incomprehensible moments of love, sacrifice and tenderness...the pure happiness and power of words.  Leisel's fascination with books begins with her discovery of The Gravediggers Manual.  Her need for words lead her to become the book thief.  Stolen books open her world to love and friendship.  Books become her salvation and her own book, The Book Thief, even captures the heart of Death.  The writer's style grabs your imagination from the first word and you won't be able to put this book down until the very last word....and then you'll be sad it's over.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I read the views on this app and they seemed pretty good so I downloaded it. (I have a kindle fire btw.) But every time I tried to watch a video it would kick me off the app and a pop up would say vtube has stopped. It kept saying every time I even tried different times and re-downloading it. Please fix?
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|It's Metallica, what else is there to say. This is probably the best album overall that they have ever released.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is sick I haven't stop play since I started and so much fun. Must download u won't regret it
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Best controler I have ever had.  You get what you pay for.<br />Fast shipping, Not pricey if you look at what your getting.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Although  you can pay for premium rare cards, it's absolutely not necessary since you gradually gain crystals at a generous rate. The game is definitely challenging so finally beating a difficult opponent feels greatly rewarding. Come join the fun!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T READ &#34;A TIME TO KILL,' AND IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO READ IT, DO SO **BEFORE** YOU READ &#34;SYCAMORE ROW&#34;!<br /><br />I've read and enjoyed almost all of Grisham's books. &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; takes place in the same county and includes some of the same characters as &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34; It is true that the stories are completely different, but there are so many references to &#34;A Time to Kill,&#34; the first of Grisham's novels, that now I know the story AND the verdict in the case, even though I have not read the book. That's a shame, because I do intend to read &#34;A Time to Kill,&#34; but for me, there will be no suspense.<br /><br />That said, I think this is perhaps the finest of Grisham's books. The characters are beautifully developed, the plot is fascinating, there is suspense, intrigue, and a perfect resolution to the story, including the jury verdict and dénouement.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if you like tycoon games you will lobe this game so fun. please play this game.I know you will like it
B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of the most amazing books I read!<br />It provides certainly some &#34;wisdom for Life&#34;!<br />An excellent and inspiring book!
B00005KK4P|4.0|The set was what I expected. Great sound and a wonderful performance. All the music I have purchsed from Amazon has been exactly what I wanted. The only surprise was the Glazunov symphonies. Which I love.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check the temp. A lot. This app is so accurate. I no longer depend on my outdoor thermometer. Great app!!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Very close to the original, Gene Roddenberry would be proud.  Love that they have advanced Uhura into a 21st Century woman instead of just a bit of decoration.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Beautiful graphics and a great story make this game a joy to play. The only problem is that it is very short. I still loved it and highly recommend it to those who enjoy a fun adventure that plays flawlessly on the first generation Kindle Fire.
B0081336FO|4.0|Really Like this version of Sherlock.  His portrayal is updated, complex enough to be very interesting, and his side kick Watson does a very stellar job.
014241543X|5.0|Great book. Very well written book. I loved it and ordered the sequel right after reading this book. Thanks Gayle Forman.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used this alarm clock for almost two years now and rely on it to get up for school in the morning. It has a useful timer and is very easy to use. I strongly recommend using this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It really matters if a game is good or not, in this case is not only good... well awesome hahah is also hilarious!!! Very first time I laugh so hard while playing :) You'll never get tired of seeing a minion pushing the others hahah at least I never do.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Very entertaining for the whole family.  The characters are crafted from wonderful imagination and fun to watch.  The kind of movie you watch with your kids and end up saying how you wish they'd make more movies like it.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|My husband and I laughed so hard! It's hilarious.  Definitely not for kids though! Jennifer Aniston is great in this movie.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|The whole book series and movies were the best. I remember when the first movie came out twilight, that was on a low bidget and by New Moon it expoded.  The movies got better and the epic series began.  I  hope Immortal instuments city of bone, City of Ashes, City of Glass, City of Fallen Angels and City of Lost Souls will get that chance.  These should be as  advertising as the Twilight series. Form the first to the last of the series of Twilght; Twilight, New Moon( which got better and more epic coverge and by Eclipes the fan were going wild, then Breaking Dawn 1 and then at last Breaking Dawn 2  which was done with allot of effort with more advertiing, but by that time after the twree other movies we had to see the love and the creation in the last book and for me,and movie.  My best regard Lori McMaster
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present and I couldn't believe the price at $7.99 on Cyber Monday!! He will love that its the new unrated cut and blue-ray! Thanks Amazon!
1416914293|5.0|The Book was great and I and my daugter read all the series.  We also went to the theater to see the first move the City of Bones and I have just downloaded the movie in my Amazon Library. The books showed courage, mystery, adventure, and extreme action a deep love between two people and other connections and bond to save humanity between Good and Evil.  Each book just got better and better ( as I hope the movies series will be}.  I felt that more advertising for the movie in the US with media outlets and a longer running time to fit each movie.  Other than that I would recommend this these books and the movie to the world, Your 55 year old fan Lori L McMaster
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Just like the main plot is about, it is very addicting.<br />What more can I say other than \\"I Love It!\\"
0553801473|5.0|What can I say; great series but I have to say thier may of been a little to much of detail.  Other than that I read all the book and watched all the series on HBO, that really needed more episodes to justify the books.  Can't wait for the next book.  Please be a bit kinder to the South Mr. Martin my best regards Lori
1616614609|5.0|Wife and I have been playing the hell out of Netrunner this past week. Great game. Great value (IMO). KInd of wish there was a bigger secondary market for additional copies of cards for deckbuilding, but that's not a huge issue.  Either way. Excellent game.<br /><br />Be cautioned, though... It has a pretty steep learning curve. We would've saved a lot of headache had we watched an on-line tutorial before jumping in. Just a lot going on.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

B001RU2YUQ|5.0|Again I watched this on demand that I could of bought the movie.  So; I downloaded the movies in my Library on amazon.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was always on yr seat wondering what was gonna happen and whom would win the never ending battle for earth
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Avatar was one of the greatest movie besides the trilogy Lord of the Rings.  I was so impressed I tried to find trees and flowers that would kind of look like the forest of Avatar for our forest.  We are working on it now.  AAAA
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I bought this collection as a gift for my wife because she loves all things Batman (I mean who doesn't).  The package came in great condition and all four movies play wonderfully.  Very pleased with this collection, this is exactly what I was looking for.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I was not a fan of &#34;The Fame,&#34; and I didn't get on the &#34;Fame Monster&#34; bandwagon until after the EP's popularity had fizzled.  &#34;Born This Way&#34; came out and I was thoroughly impressed, so I had high expectations for &#34;ARTPOP.&#34;  At first listen I felt like &#34;This is not Born This Way, I'll pass&#34; but then I kept getting into it more and more and my appreciation grew.  While I can admit that it sounds nothing like &#34;Born This Way&#34; and is not as lyrically and conceptually groundbreaking like its predecessor, &#34;ARTPOP&#34; feels more like an experimental effort and return to Gaga's dance and EDM roots, which is simply alright with me.<br /><br />Of the more progressive EDM tracks, I love &#34;Aura,&#34; and &#34;Swine.&#34;  From beginning to end, these tracks go off immediately and grab your attention.  &#34;Donatella&#34; and &#34;Gypsy&#34; even, she holds back on these more modern dance tracks in a good way, but it works in my opinion.<br /><br />When she gives me that rock edge, &#34;MANiCURE&#34; and &#34;Mary Jane Holland&#34; satisfy.  You just want to let loose and let go, and it's expressed through the lyrics.<br /><br />That throwback [David] Bowie she delivers on &#34;Venus,&#34; &#34;ARTPOP,&#34; &#34;Fashion!&#34; and &#34;Applause&#34; is so nostalgic I just lose it every time these tracks come on.  You're listening and wondering if the material is really hers because it sounds so authentic and classic, vintage even.<br /><br />Her hybrid of Dance and Pop are her finest works to me with &#34;G.U.Y.&#34; as well as &#34;Sexxx Dreams,&#34; more so because a casual listener will probably ignore the R&B tinges in each of these, though it is most prominent in &#34;Jewels N' Drugs&#34; (an odd and seemingly out of place track on the album if you ask me) and &#34;Do What U Want.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Dope&#34; is the only song that I'm not too in love with as much as I try.  Maybe eventually, but just not right now.<br /><br />Overall I think the album is solid.  Does it seem a bit rushed and not as thought through as her previous efforts?  I think so.  Is it her best?  I guess it depends on who you're asking, as I've mentioned, to me, &#34;Born This Way&#34; was a heavy hitter, but this isn't far behind.  I've admired Gaga the most for her lyrical content, as well as her musical talent.  So for me, the lack of depth of the songs was just slightly disappointing.  Conceptually, I was also unsure, but upon further listen, most notably the many different layers and meanings to the songs (as art can be, an interpretation not necessarily of the artist, but of the viewer, listener, etc.), I began to see what it was all about.<br /><br />This album truly isn't about trying to please, gain a number one single, etc., apparent in her choice of the first couple of singles that have been released (if she wanted that, we might have gotten &#34;G.U.Y.&#34; as her reintroduction, it seems the most radio-friendly despite its suggestiveness).  And I don't think that this will be a mainstream success since the appeal of who she is has faded, and is apparent by how fickle the North American market has responded to this project.  But what I do know is she's an artist, and you either appreciate it, or sit back and hate because you just don't undersatnd or get it.<br /><br />And this listener appreciates it.  Paws up./><br />Overall I think the album is solid.  Does it seem a bit rushed and not as thought through as her previous efforts?  I think so.  Is it her best?

B0054U56B4|5.0|The whole series with so much intense; which I do with all the books and movies I love.  There was humor, adventure, love, action and mystery.  I could not put the books down.  I do hope they continue with the movies Loved these books as my daughter does as well.  please continue with the movies series, respectfully yours Lori L McMaster
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome time killer. Fun to play when there is absolutely nothing else better to do. Could use some more freebies though
B0042KA4VO|5.0|Vampire Diaries is one of my favorite tv show.  I just turned off HBO, SHOWTIME, and the other and just got the orginal package.  I will be getting a DVD and start buying my favorite shows.
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|For the most part the actors did a fair job acting their parts. A few excelled and got into their character. However the presentation suffered with the fabricated injection of sensuality between Don John and his moll Conrade. Cudos for Amy Acker, Jillian Morgese, and Clark Gregg who all did exceptionally and portrayed their characters with passion. The artistic production/setting was excellent. The choice of a Black & White presentation helped this viewer meld the original old english script with the present day setting. It wasn't long before I forgot it wasn't in color. Advice to newcomers to Much Ado, read the play before you watch it. It's a short 20 minute read and you'll enjoy the production much more.  Overall I liked it enough to buy a copy. jgskaya

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Roth surprised me.  Too often, the plot is predictable in a series, but I was not expecting (or not wanting) the ending.  Finishing this series was like having my favorite tv comedy go off the air.
B003NTSBTC|3.0|Leonardo was great in this film but the film itself was not really cut out of him.  I watched more because of the actor than the script.
0375413405|5.0|Classic for the ages, use it many times a week a true classic reference work for the  wannabe French chef

B0017QSZW6|5.0|The Tudors was a great fanasty documetry and they couldn't have casted a better cast with Johnthan and all his wifes.  Great epic series on HBO. Sincerely Lori L
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Couldn't put this down. So very happy Zoe suggested we read this for December!s book club. Looking forward to discussing Friday night!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Story line was kind of jumbled. It also seemed a bit fuzzy on our HD screen. It wasn't as good as the first one.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Animal captivity of any kind is just wrong. Some of the footage is heartbreaking. I have read a lot of various incidents involving captive orcas with each other and human trainers on different websites.  Hopefully, a lot of people can WAKE UP ! and really see this as a industry that must be changed in terms of just shutting down.  When I was 11 years old, I read about orcas whales. I went to the public library and checked out different books on the subject. That was the old fashioned way of doing research ! With all the webpages and all the different media our there, why can't anyone just log in online, read articles and watch photos, steam videos of these magnificent mammals. If you have any questions or doubts about anything, do your own research. There really is NO need for these parks, because you don't really learn much. Thank you for all the directors and producers and for CNN for this documentary.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The song that made me fall in love with these guys was the video of Carol of the Bells...it is amazing.  I have all three of their CD's and am going to see them in concert in March.  They put so much heart and soul into their music and it really comes through.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I miss my Google reader, but this is the next best thing. Imported all of my feeds and keeps everything as organized as you want it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is wow. This book was such an incredible story about strength, love, and of course hope.
0723257639|5.0|Absolutely beautiful collection!  I was read these books as a child, and have fond memories of going to the library and choosing the next little white book in the series to check out.  I knew I wanted the same little white books for my daughter when she was born.  She's too young for them yet, but I still read them to her every morning.  The display box is just lovely, and includes a cutout/popup type display in the inside lid.  I'd definitely recommend this set for any 'first library'!
1606995359|4.0|This reprinting of the Carl Barks stories is not nearly as attractive as the Rainbow Publishing prints that were produced in the '90s. Of course Rainbow Publishing lavishly recolored the stories and (unless someone is a purist) greatly enhanced the appearance, without sacrificing the artwork of Carl Barks. It would be great to see all the Rainbow Carl Barks archive reprinted in coffee table hardback archival quality volumes. But I am guessing that is unlikely.<br />That said, there is a certain nostalgic charm to reading these stories presented in their original published colors. The production of the volumes in this series is adequate and seem to be printed on a good quality matte finish paper. For the Devoted Carl Barks fans these volumes do offer a fresh inexpensive perspective. Perhaps the covers of these volumes could be a tad more interesting?<br />So even though I have the original comics from the '50s, all the Rainbow reprints (Color & B/w) and several other miscellaneous anthologies, I am purchasing all of these volumes.<br />I am looking forward to seeing the (hopefully) full run of the DON ROSA stories being printed in a similar manner starting in mid 2014. (Since there really isn't an American printing of his stories in a hardback format.)<br />I would love to see someone produce a lavish, large archival quality coffee table format of all the Dell Walt Disney Comics and Stories, Donald Duck, and Uncle Scrooge comics 1940s- mid 1950s.) Walt Kelly and others created some very interesting covers.<br />Rainbow did release a series of large portfolio style prints of the Carl Barks covers in the '80s but the paper quality was not the best choice and the prints were overly large and the printing was only adequate. The portfolios included some small poorly produced images of some of the Walt Kelly covers. So there is a real need for a quality volume on this subject.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Exciting and lots of fun.  Can't wait to see RED 2 The cast was wonderful.  Will highly recommend the movie to anyone.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Often when someone tries to do something new with something that's been around for a while, the outcome is very disappointing.  I feared this may be the case with the new Muppets movie but I was pleased to see the good ol' Muppets, just how I remembered them!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Each album tends to bring out more of Chino's influences, but Koi No Yokan is another great album from one of the most underrated bands of it's generation. Sergio Vega has a completely different dynamic from Chi, but was also the perfect addition to the band.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|the actors are good,,,,would like to see more interaction with... will,,,peter,,,and Alisha...that's mostly why I watch it the court room drama is just ok.
1401938906|5.0|Amazing book. A little advanced. I believe that unless you are already pretty spiritual and aligned with the positive energies and the universe, you might not be able to complete all of the exercises... but VERY profound, light... and LOVELY
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game, it is a steal for free and the fact that global fights are coming makes it even better. The upgrading system is fun and all the bots have there own unique qualities.  Over all this game is a great purchase and you should get it.
1439181780|5.0|This one of the most amazing, light, easy to read and profound book... I am so grateful for Rhonda Byrne. Such a great being. This book is far more cultivated, higher vibrations, easier to apply to daily life than &#34;&#34;the secret,&#34; her first book. I also love &#34;the magic&#34; book of hers. This books, if studied and applied can really help anyone learn how to use energy, vibrations, and law of attraction to reach its highest potential as a human being. We are electrical beings, that is science, if we learn hot to use that energy to our benefit LIFE IS TRANSFORMED... Rhonda does a great way in a simple way. I love new age, doctrine, philosophy type of literature, but I love that her books are for ANYONE. SIMPLE and easy to digest :-).
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These guys make music fun. They have amazing talent and love what they do. Their music is about the only Christmas music I don't hate.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|This is quite an enjoyable read. While the villain is not very believable he is a very scary and unpleasant person. The heroes are a little unrealistic but they do solve the mystery. I had guessed early what sort of person the villain was and was surprised when the heroes took so long. Otherwise I found it an easy to read and enjoyable book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Another awesome album from The Piano Guys!!  I have loved Steven and Johns music since before they all got together!!
B00GH4R95C|3.0|It was ok but the story wasn't all that interesting. Could have been more traditional like with office interactions with co workers before revealing his powers. The graphics were great and that's what made it good. I recommend renting first before actually buying!!!!
B00406UK7S|3.0|I admit to enjoying action movies about the early middle ages.  This tale is about how  a Roman legion got slaughtered by Picts in northern Scotland.  The few Roman centurions who survived the vicious attack is the main theme of this story.  They are on the run and traveling north to get away from their pursuers. The problem is that they are on foot and their enemy is riding horses.<br /><br />There are some great fighting scenes and lots of running in this film.  This film reminded me a little of previous films dealing with the Romans fighting the rebels in Britain and Scotland.  In any case, this is an okay film to see but not a great one.  If you are into early Roman history and battles you will enjoy viewing this film<br /><br />Rating:  3 Stars.  Joseph J.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is one of the best game that I recommend for anybody that likes fun, adventure, racing, and likes getting really fast and muddy.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I can play this game without help from friends. The only issue I have is I run out of lives too fast. 8-)
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game, beautiful visuals, no lag as there is with most most mobile games.  The console game is great too
B005PK57NU|5.0|And the drama continues! You would think that the show would start to be boring by now, but it gets better. I love watching the court trials. They can be quite entertaining.
0545157617|5.0|Fun Christmas book for children. Stick Man goes on an unplanned but interesting journey. This book is a family favorite!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is a great series. Action-packed! Hectic day-to-day life with all its ups and downs. I do wish she would get with Will.
076115728X|5.0|Honestly the best book we have ever purchased for our son! We are big book lovers in our house and this book is truly unique and so creative you will want to purchase more from this author! We bought two more for the nephews!

B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is another all time favorite of mine.  If you like musicals this is among the BEST!  Julie Andrews voice was simply BEAUTIFUL!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Awesome fun!  Might just be my favorite dash game and that's saying a lot, since I own them all.  I highly recommend it.
B000IDEORY|5.0|DIRTY DANCING is one of my long time favorites.  I love the music and the dancing is AWESOME! And Patrick Swayze is nice looking as a bonus. Jennifer Grey does a great job also.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|You've got to watch it once because it's Superman, but once was plenty. The ending of the movie is just explosion after explosion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun, easy, compact game.  One does have to use the ol' noggin, however, as levels get higher.
B008JFURII|5.0|This movie is just as enjoyable as the first RED. It has humor, action,and romance. Who could ask for more!?
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I love Celine Dion and this new CD is awesome!  It's a bit edgier but not overdone  Still her beautiful voice is there.  Love the songs!!  A++++++++
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Beautiful collection of songs with significant personal humor from the lead singer. Has a substantial &#34;Irish&#34; sound to it and I would recommend it highly. Very folk-like in its overall sound.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book to read<br />Must read book and read the next one for the other part of the story and movies
B0017U7PT6|2.0|Very boring movie.  Effects are not even as seamless as they should be for this day and age.  Nt worth your money.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The PianoGuys Totally Nailed This One! Amazing Set Of Songs!  These guys are amazing. Absolutely beautiful renditions of these great songs that you are sure to love.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This is a must have movie for any my littlte pony lover.. after watching it on tv almost every day with our daughter my husband and I decided we had to get a copy for our 4 year old daughter.Super Fast delivery, excellent price..thanks Amazon

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is like another &#34;Bible&#34; and well worth the read...everyone should absorb this guide into<br />their every day life...and their soul.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|AccuRadio is totally &quot;awesome&quot;. My taste in music is so diverse and this app has it all...and then some.<br /><br />I highly recommend  AccuRadio. You will find everything you're looking for in great music, as well as a quality app and user-friendly.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|It just jelled with my CANON T3i like the spiderman suit!!! Recommended for those who needs a protective cover to put the cam in backpack!!!
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|I bought this chest rig last Christmas and have since then used it in roughly ten airsoft skirmishes and one op. I would rate it five stars if it were not for (the last time I used it, this weekend at the op) the back strap that connects the molle panel and the buckle tore off. I at first thought that the buckle had simply come undone, but upon reaching behind me and attempting to re buckle, I discovered that the buckle was together but the whole thing came off the side of the chest rig (the part you see in the bottom right of the product image). This was quickly remedied by zip tying the buckle back onto the molle portion of the vest (this will do until I get my mom to sew the strap back onto the panel).<br /><br />As far as the actual product itself goes, it lacks slightly the wow factor (this is an airsoft based review) that conventional plate carriers have but is a step ahead of the tactical vests made by utg ect. It serves its purpose extremely well and does not keep you very hot while wearing it. I would not count off on the rating because of the non removable mag pouches for they are advertised as so and regardless are what I would have put there anyways. I use all six to carry my mags and then I put two more in the map compartment that is against the wearers stomach. I bought and admin pouch and an emt pouch to go on the molle panels. The pistol mag pouches are great for holding things like a flashlight, multi-tool, spare battery for your rifle, co2 cartridges, pistol speed loaders, or heck.. even pistol mags. It is very adjustable, I am 5'11&#34; slightly muscular build, and not skinny and had to adjust it down considerably to fit me the way I liked it, and there appears to be much more adjustment room to make it smaller.<br /><br />like I said earlier, there is a map pouch between the wearer and the rig, but between that pouch and the mag pouches, there is another map pouch that is held together with strong Velcro. I use this area to hold my dead rag in with just a corner of the rag poking out so I don't have to fumble around in my pockets or the emt pouch while getting shot to get it out. just pull the protruding corner of the rag and out she comes.<br /><br />Overall, five star product, but minus one star for the stitching coming undone on the back strap, I should probably take more than one off, but I really like the vest and I like fixing things so yeah, take it with a grain of salt.
B00F522C7C|5.0|I am satisfied as it arrived on time. I also can not wait til my son opens it and we can watch it together!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Helpful though got long at some points throughout the book. I enjoyed the thoughtfulness however and have seen the principles discussed work first hand. Stay positive!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook!! I can keep in touch with my friends and family that I don't get to see or talk to often. Thank You!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|It's for my special needs child and he likes it. shows a lot of more interest in the kindle now.  .
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Love it makes me feel more secure about scratching or banging it. Nice color too, easy to locate in purse or any where. Not that it glows in the dark or anything. Good to have.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!! Best Books Ive ever read! I still have some questions i need a hunger games expert to answer! Anyway amazing book!
B00GT67UUM|5.0|Just got this and I am very pleased. Great for your mind and I am looking for more and more from the makers of this fantastic app.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Comes in very handy, and is nice that you can wake up to the song of your choice. I Love it
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is by far, my sons favorite Christmas Cd. As soon as he walks in the house, he turns on this cd. Not a bad song on it. Normally, I'm hesitant to buy newer Christmas cds (I prefer the classics), but this is The Piano Guys!! You won't be disappointed.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo will not send any mail due to their security code.<br />It will not except the matching code or give me an error.<br />I'm looking for another internet server that will give me<br />Service.  I only use a kindel fire. I think thry can not<br />allow kindel fire users to use the mail the way it is in-<br />Tended.  Their customer service told me they would<br />look into the problem but they did nothing. Then I<br />got an email that said since they did not hear from me<br />They thought the problem was solved by them doing<br />Nothing. So if anyone that knows an Internet provider<br />That kindel fire users can use let me know alfdoalfa@yahoo.com.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I have not stoped playing since I got it, though I really don't have much time lol... I gave it 4 stars only because I feel higher payout for the events would make it a better play... but if you don't have time and can play over and over the same l l like me this is it.... I'm sure soon I'll put the in app purchase to use so I can dominate the net and game lol
0316219266|5.0|I loved the book, I get that it's not 100% accurate, I was entertained, and I'm an Amazon enthusiast.  My wife and myself are Prime members.  I can't wait for Amazon Fresh to enter Atlanta.  Nothing will change that - hell, paying sales tax didn't deter me in the least (well maybe until I bought a big TV, but that was more about fear of shipping and delivery than paying equal to Costco).<br /><br />My point is - it's a book.  Enjoy it.  Take it with a grain of salt.  Some things are wrong - and welcome to the Internet, the world's biggest place to point out everything wrong with others' facts.<br /><br />As a side-note, MacKenzie Bezos' review uses curly-quotes.  I find the scathing review interesting that it was pasted from a word processor.  See:  &#34; and ' versus... “ and ” and ’
030759565X|5.0|One of the best cookbooks I have bought in a really long time. Every recipe is amazing and honestly, it's all great food anyone can make. Would make an excellent gift for friends who cook. Great job!!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My kid likes this a lot.  Great packaging when being shipped and exactly as expected.  Great creative toy for kids to play with.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Another great album by the Piano Guys!  Don't know how they keep outdoing themselves, but every album they make is great!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I almost didn't buy this after reading reviews about people getting this and the sound quality was bad and just complaining about every little thing about it.. people were really putting this box set down ive only got to listen to two albums so far and it sounds wonderful no complaints at all. it came well very well packaged and I am so glad I added this to my collection. I got pretty lucky and picked it up from importcds for 150$
0780020685|5.0|A classic story by film director Akira Kurosawa.  The realistic portrayal of a small medieval Japanese village whose peasants hire 7 samurai to defend their crops and lively hood against a small band of thieves.
B000006OBQ|5.0|If you are a Sinatra fan, you will love this recording of a live performance done in his middle years.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is a sleeper gem!  I loved the story of this dysfunctional family's trip to the &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; beauty contest between teen girls; Its closing talent competition put an exclamation point to the story's end and satirical view of beauty contests!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Product works great.  Only problem with this is my wireless usb receiver for my Logitech Trackball M570 will not go in the port.  Microsoft and Amazon Basics one fits fine.<br />Do I have a defective device?<br /><br />Edit-Dec 16, 2013 Again, Great customer service.  I was sent a replacement device.  I will note though that I do have to use a usb extension cable.  My logitech wireless receiver may be too big so if you're using a Logitech wireless usb receiver, you may want to buy an extension cable as this will not fit in the hub.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cool game it is fun to find the right why to get the puzzle right and to move from level to level
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I gave the 2 stars for cool effects.Jaden Smith already ruined the remake of Kar.kid.Where Will Smith is a good actor,he knew his kid stunk.he should have done this with someone else,or sent his son to acting school.
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|excellent sound.  all musicians of this cd all incredible.  Hiromi plays piano very clearly in her sound.  I hope you enjoys it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really have fun playing this game it allows me to upgrade the gun at a faster speed which I am happy with because it sometimes annoys me when it takes a lot of money in the game and time
B000ZFI1GK|5.0|This is a must have CD if you are an Eagles fan. Amazing writing and musicianship. Long Road Out of Eden will blow you away!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read lately. At first I wasn't sure if I would like it. But the longer I  read the more it pulled me in. I had not heard of this book before. But I saw a preview of the movie that is based on the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it. It is the first game I go to when I want to play on my devices.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love this album!!  Definitely a must have!!  These guys are so talented.<br />I love Christmas music and this CD made me love it more.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Ms. Gabaldon has a firm grasp on human nature and how to put it into words.  I've read almost everything she has written and will continue to do so.  I just wish she wrote more books.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app allows me to know exactly how much time I have for several different actions on my Kindle Fire HD 8.6, such as reading, video playback, music, etc. Great visuals if you are in a hurry. Also, nice lady scares the crud out of you every so often by intoning, &#34;Battery is 50% charged.&#34;.......&#34;Battery is 75% charged.&#34;, etc.....Actually very helpful once you've determined that nobody is hiding under your bed....... :0)<br />Tami T.
B000QRIGLC|2.0|Way too long !!<br /><br />I have just read several of the one and two stars reviews and several of them are far more succinct than I'll ever be so I'll just keep my review short as its all been said before. I actually LOST respect for the SEALS on this op as it was frayed with several basic flaws. Having their cover blown, and then deciding not to kill the 3 goatherders, they needed to but out immediately and abort the mission. Also, what the hell happened to their radio? What kind of equipe is that ! Later on, Lt. Murphy uses a CELL phone to call for help. Thats what should have been done straight away. What did they think the 3 goatherders were going to do !!! Amazing stupidity, for me. Once discovered, that mission was history. Especially with tons of Taliban in the area. All dumb and the waste of those 3 lives. It perhaps shows that where we think of SEALS as being all powerful, they ain't. This story proves it.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|Had no idea the Kindle Fire HD 8.6 had NO FRONT FACING CAMERA! Very disappointing.....might have changed my mind about buying the Kindle Fire HD.....
B0090SI582|1.0|A fine film, however at the time of this writing the associated image for this DVD clearly says \\"Includes two versions: Theatrical and Unrated extended Cut\\" only the Theatrical cut is available on this set, do not buy if looking for the extended cut.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|HUGE, LONG~TIME STEPHEN KING FAN!!! And this sequel to the 70's best seller, The Shining, does NOT disappoint. Is it necessary to read The Shining first, if you haven't already? In my opinion, YES! And seeing the movie with Jack Nicholson does NOT COUNT.....Doctor Sleep holds up on it's own, of course, but it is so much richer when paired with The Shining.<br /><br />Great read!!<br /><br />:0)<br />Tami T.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazing music by amazing musicians!  Awesome album.  Get it NOW!!!!  Be sure and check out their videos on Youtube.com.  You'll love it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story line is intriguing and keeps you on the edge.  The ending was a little disappointing to me though.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|All I have to say is that this game is awesome. Just trying to waste words blah blah blah blah
B001DTTG16|4.0|Yes, a lot of the fashion and music is dated… But the dancing is always amazing to see over and over again!
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|One song in particular makes this rating and that is Little Drummer Boy. The soul within this one song is absolute perfection. This is not meant to belittle the other songs, but Little Drummer Boy has become cherished by many many or my friends and aquaitences.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is such a fun show! My son and I just love it and this season is wonderful! Amazon sent this quickly and we are highly satisfied.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|A great romp. Yes, there were plot holes. How do you get to another universe through the ocean toward the center of the earth? And, the monsters and (worm hole?) could have really been done better. But, the Jaegers were awesome. I can suspend disbelief when I want to be entertained, and it was easy with this film. And, post movie critiques didn't lessen the experience for me. I thought all the actors did great jobs, and I loved the ending which reminded me of the end of a James Bond film.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Action packed and a very cool story line. Great story line with a good cast. A unique take on what is to come.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|This is a good adaptation of the basic Carccassonne game, with one expansion.  I have no major complaints about what it is, but I wish it had more expansions available (even as add-ons) and I wish it was able to challenge random or selected people online through some kind of system like the online version of die Siedler von Catan has.  The AI isn't slacking on this, though, and made for a pretty good game.
B00DNO2LFC|5.0|This is the New Zealand frontier as experienced by a Scotswoman and her daughter.  Her muteness seems to have widened her already wide eyes, and raw New Zealand fills them, and us, with wonder.  Into this &#34;silence where hath been no sound&#34; she brings her piano, which had been her voice and her anchor.  But, as in the American Frontier, this perpetual hacking a civilization out of a Wilderness creates troublesome relationships, as passions long suppressed precariously reveal themselves.  I believe there are no unsympathetic characters here, only characters confused by their passions.<br /><br />That anchor must be cut loose, and that voice rediscovered, if she is to grow with love into her New World.
B0007939NO|3.0|This movie is one that I love but I am disappointed that the quality of this dvd is not very good.  Needs to be remastered to upgrade the quality.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|i love this game. I could not put the game down. I like all the lives you get y ouare able to play for a while. the game does not stop in the middle of your play time. great game.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I personally have not watched it yet, bought it for my son for Christmas because he saw it before and said it was one of the best movies he has ever seen.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Outstanding action, plot, characterization and tremendous special effects (and great acting, of course) make this movie a keeper and worth seeing again in a few days!
B000GT7XXW|2.0|It's all right. Guess I'm so used to Netflix. This is the 1st time I watched movies on Amazon Prime. No wonder this movie is free. Very boring.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Wonderful Music! I love the cello solos and how they make it sound so Great and easy. A very good instermentl CD.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Why make us pay for the crowns by. Everyone can ,t afford it.  YOU GET US HOOKED AND THAN WANT MONEY SO WHY DO YOU SAY ITS FREE
B0081SRJSY|2.0|Faithfully recreates the game Carcassonne but it's not the version available for iPad, which has online multiplayer, and has been out for longer than two years. The bots are barely smart enough to be opponents.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book and one I had trouble putting down.  Most non-sci-fi readers think science fiction is all about space battles, but this is a great example of how a deep, meaningful story can be told in a futuristic setting.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is the classic game with an optional auto complete. option to hide or show time. It also keeps statistics.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This little game can grow on you.  It definitely gets harder as you go, good way to waste some time
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game.It's challenging but my grandkids have no problem playing the game and figuring out the strategy of the vampires placement to make the shots .It's alot of fun.
B00GX59QO2|1.0|This sequel just didn't have the fun of the first.  It just seemed to ramble without any plot and very few funny lines.
1416972250|5.0|Love, Love , Love this series!!!! Cassandra Claire captures a wide audience. I am 33 and I love her sic-fi, enchanting, and mysterious stories of the dark side. You definitely have to have an imagination and like the fantasy world to truly appreciate her work in my opinion.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  It was well done and acting was good especially the two boys
1416972242|5.0|Love, Love , Love this series!!!! Cassandra Claire captures a wide audience. I am 33 and I love her sic-fi, enchanting, and mysterious stories of the dark side. You definitely have to have an imagination and like the fantasy world to truly appreciate her work in my opinion.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not as funny as the first two. I would not watch this again. The actors are great, but the film was just not likeable.
B00785P2QC|5.0|you should get it I am not having problems with it all I promise.I would because I already did get it check it Out
B00B5NXC1A|5.0|love, love 19 times until we rub out all the consequential. just listen, you will fall in... 3 more. best purchase yet
B000002H92|2.0|They create better musically in the studio than live.  There live version is so unpleasant to the ears and you think they will outdo the studio version.  A total waste of money.  The only two decent songs I like were &#34;The End&#34; and &#34;Love Me 2 Times&#34;.  They evern butchered the song of &#34; 5 to 1&#34; and that's one of my favorite songs of their collections studio wise.  I'm not pleased.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book gab  me all I wanted  in terms of \\"fluff\\" by  without  over doing it and still leaving me wanting more.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I love these. They are great for casual/business casual situations. I wear these so much barefoot that I've worn holes in the pinky toe areas of the crocs but can't find it in me to get rid of these. They are so comfy and my feet never smell after a full day's wear. I couldn't say a negative thing about these crocs if you paid me to say something bad about them. They feel great day after day, week after week, month after month. I wear these everyday of the week and cannot get over how comfortable they are, even after being a year old! You will not regret this purchase.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Could not drop this book once I started reading it. Anthony such an inspiration. I love the red hot chili peppers!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An Amazing story full of twists and turns that kept me on my toes.  Full of the old south, excellent!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun game of strategy. Must have 4 players, and 4 players only, but that is usually not a problem for us.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really interesting story, very well told.  Grisham is obviously the best at writing the &#34;legal thriller&#34; and he crafts a compelling read. I read a great deal, and I would put this novel right at the top of my favorites for the entire year.<br /><br />Without giving away too much plot, suffice to say that we are dealing with the deep South and questions of race and racism in the late 80's.  Add to this the strange death of a rich white man (who almost no one liked or knew very well) and his insistence in his new will to fully cut out his entire family while giving away his wealth to someone else.  Add to this his desire to let small time lawyer Jake Brigance handle everything after his death-- because he sees Jake as the only honest lawyer in town!!!<br /><br />Sparks will fly in all directions, and trhe plot quickly thickens-- really GOOD stuff.  If you've enjoyed Grisham before, you'll like this novel-GET IT!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I actually haven't purchased this yet, but I have heard the music and it's fantastic. I love this group of musicians - very inspiring and uplifting music, and so well performed. I will be getting this music for this Christmas season!
B003F5NSTW|5.0|First I saw the movie. And I thought: \\"There must me more to it that I see here.\\" It was like I saw only fragments of what was really going on. So I was happy that there was a book where the movie was based on. And I read it almost without breathing. I think it is so wel written. The struggle with bringing up Kevin for the mother, the despair, never knowing what is right, what to do. And Kevin showing a whole other side to his father. The accidents that happen. I will not say too much because you really have to read it yourself. The devastating end. And the questions and mess and chaos his mother has to deal with after this. And after that I've watched the movie again. This time I could fill in the gaps. The book will always be dear to me.
B00902AKK4|3.0|I purchased this game for my son to play but it was a bit too difficult for him.  I tried to play it as well and it was a little too complicated.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of the game at first, but when I played it for the first time I went crazy and nearly beat the first part of the game straightforward. Glad it's free, it's so much fun to play.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I love this CD and enjoy the music of Tom Petty and the Heart breakers.This is an excellent work of musical art.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is one of the most funny, clever, talented comedy writers!  Her stories are instantly identifiable, accessible, and personal.  She's like any reader's best friend; simultaneously the best person you know, but somehow still unsure and unsettled herself, and her stories reflect your own misgivings about your life as an adult, your childhood, your relationships, but in a funny way that concedes that none of us have it figured out...and that everything will be okay anyway.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|I think someone wrote the script for this movie over their lunch break - Just watch the preview and you'll see the only funny parts of the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game . My favorite game ever. Best game ever!!!  It is great you should get this game. Kaiya my cousin has never played this.  Now she can!!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This app is just ok. I just started playing but it's a game you can only play for a few minutes at a time then you wait and wait, play for a few more minutes and wait.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|these games are great but it's too easy for my 4 yr old great grandson to buy more. He spent over $30 before I knew it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great series. This is the second time I read &#34;Catching Fire&#34; and I can't wait to start the 3rd one again.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This continues the story of Ajax Penumbra and his amazing book store.I liked the mystery. The characters are well drawn out. I liked the detail in the computer descriptions. Just a fun story.
0345549333|1.0|If you can finish this book, you deserve a lifetime of riches. The premise sounds great but it is an absolute terrible book. I couldn't get past 75 pages. The author is arrogant and obnoxious from start to finish. It reeks of douchebaggery. It really is just bragging about every horrible self absorbed act he and his group committed.<br /><br />Jordan Belfort is just so in love with himself that this should just be his own personal diary instead of making anyone else suffer through it.
0785153942|4.0|this book has a good amount of back story in it about the jaeger program and and some of the original kaiju attacks. I really enjoyed it, but it could have used more giant robot fights. Actually most things could use more giant robots. If you are looking for more Pacific Rim, I would recommend this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is unique in that it transported me into the mind of the young boy Andrew Wiggins as he is growing up playing video games.  The relationship with his siblings and his peers in the school ring true with today's children.
1601251505|5.0|I absolutely loved this Core book. It by far outweighs any other core books I have purchased. It describes every aspect you need to know to start a new game and not suffer not knowing details. I played D&D 4E for a while and I am disguested I never thought of giving a 3.5E a chance. After this though, D&D can kiss my ass. I'm 100% Pathfinder all the way
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I really enjoyed the continuation of the Ender series.  It was captivating and once I started the book, I had a hard time putting it down.  Every waking minute went to finishing this book and led me to order the next two books in the series.
1601252463|4.0|I must say as I am impressed with all the new options available in the Advanced Player's Guide. It has given me alot of tools to use for my campaign setting as well as for the other players in my group. New rules for core races and new classes doesn't hurt either. Key word: &#34;impressed&#34;
B00A285OOW|2.0|I was quite disappointed in this book.  I had read a Philippa Gregory book quite a few years ago, so I knew I was venturing into a more historical and scholarly approach to fiction, and therefore I considered myself forewarned when I picked this up.  What disappointed me was the repetitious and--dare I say it--droning plot pattern established almost immediately.  What I will remember about the book are two principal motifs -- a sulking, unappealing, grumpy king who acts out the same crabby insecurities over and over, and a queen who never knows where she stands with her husband or her own family of origin.  It just left me unsatisfied and sort of chilled.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I had dungeon hunter 3 on my iPad and now I have dungeon hunter 4 on my kindle fire he and it is even better. Keep up the good work and I look forward to dungeon hunter 5.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love Dianne Keaton and Jack Nicholson. It is refreshing to see a love story between older people. I liked the story very much, young or old should like this movie.
B002V092B0|5.0|A honest and heart warming to read. A view from the inside when one persons life is effected by a stroke.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was very well written and had a good storyline. Very gripping, hard to put down book. Definitely would recommend to anyone!
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|Game gets stuck and asks if I want to wait. If I say yes nothing happens. Now I'm out the 99 coins. Don't bother.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I have been a longtime Fitbit user and hoped that this would provide an even better experience (Bluetooth sync, better display, pulse tracking). However, I've had a number of problems with the Pulse. First, the battery life on my unit has been quite a bit less than claimed. Worse, the unit loses data when it fully runs out of a charge (it also loses its time and date setting, though that gets restored on the first sync). I've also experienced problems with sleep tracking: the Pulse seems very finicky about remaining in sleep tracking mode, and often, without any feedback I've noticed, it's not actually tracking sleep even though I have pressed the sleep button and seen the goodnight message. Pulse tracking is also very finicky; I usually have to make multiple tries to get a result, and occasionally the results are completely out of whack (e.g. a 178 pulse reading for a resting pulse).<br /><br />Also, the Withings tracking software keeps giving annoying and repetitive messages on my iPhone asking me to &#34;restart the Withings app&#34; to sync. I can turn this off in the notification center but don't understand the need for the frequent messages.<br /><br />Pluses: the graphics in the iPhone software are clear and useful for scanning the data collected. The size an form factor of the Pulse is nice.<br /><br />I wanted to like this but feel they have a lot of work to do. I'll be looking for a different tracker.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This book is a wonderful interlacing of seemingly disparate events and characters from this amazing, troubling, exciting year of American history.  Ranging from crime to aviation to baseball to politics to inventions...what a fun and wild trip!
1611137527|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a very unusual way of looking at things.  He shakes up a lot of those old beliefs that people often take for granted as being the truth.  He certainly makes you think.  I love these CD's.  He's an excellent speaker, as well.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I like this version of free cell for the android. The cards are reasonably large,  and I love the stats!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Yes, Donna Tartt is a talented fiction writer, and you can open this novel at any page and be engaged by it. But she needs a Max Perkins to cut this down to size. There is too much prose here, too many inner reflections, too many modifiers, too much detailed description. (Do we really need six pages to describe the tedium of standing in line at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? What is this, Henry Fielding telling an interpolated story to convey the passage of time?)<br /><br />Too many precisely delineated minor characters, too many mildly eccentric hangers-on. The result for me is a dilution of sympathy for the main character. \\"When everybody's some-body, Then no one's any-body.\\"<br /><br />Tartt's cloying, over-egged pudding of a prose style makes me over-aware of the artifice going on. I often wanted to throw the book against the wall, only I have it on Audible and Kindle, so I'd be smashing my iPhone.<br /><br />Errors of fact, anachronisms, and implausible situations abound. Tartt has people using iPhones and recent-model BlackBerrys back around 2001. She's got a 13-year-old boy, an experienced Manhattanite, taking a Fifth Avenue bus to get from the Upper East Side to Greenwich Village, where he immediately gets lost (even though he's supposedly been down there often) because he is confused by the crooked old streets (although they're not crooked old streets around Fifth Avenue). Next time, Donna, put him on the subway. An eatery on Greenwich Avenue is said to be on Greenwich Street (quite some distance away). When the boy's mother gets killed, a pair of mutant-like social workers immediately descend upon the boy's apartment and abduct him. Tartt apparently thinks this happens every day and that there is some fierce stricture against 13-year-olds being alone at home.<br /><br />She's got 13-year-olds taking Advanced Placement classes (in calculus, even!) although these prodigies are not being packed off to college for another few years. But the weirdest feature of Tarttland is that everybody has a thoroughgoing knowledge of art history and decorative arts, and will rhapsodize like a coked-up antiques queen at the slightest provocation. Even our narrator, at age 13, is using words like \\"faience\\" and \\"finial.\\"<br /><br />The only reason to read this book (unless you're spending a couple weeks in bed) is to learn how to write long-form fiction and how not to write long-form fiction. Class, this month's exercise is to take Donna Tartt's 'The Goldfinch' and edit it down to 250 pages. Next month we turn that into a screenplay of 200 pages. First step: lose most of the minor characters.<br /><br />But four stars for overall talent and effort.of Tarttland is that everybody has a thoroughgoing knowledge of art history and decorative arts, and will rhapsodize like a coked-up antiques queen at the slightest provocation.

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is a GREAT album!  I almost bought the non-deluxe version, but then I saw that this album has multiple Piano Guys videos on it (which my husband has been scouring the internet to find), so this purchase was a no-brainer.  If you enjoy The Piano Guys, this album is SURE to please!  :D
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Good acting, plauseable story line.  Action packed.<br />Tatum and Foxx work well together in this movie.<br />Would recommend it for family viewing
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I purchased this application based on my long time use of the PC product as I wasn't disappointed. It worked exactly the way it was supposed to work.
B000002O1Q|5.0|I enjoyed the fantasy format. Overall good acting and story line.<br />Moderate violence and language. Good music and action helps<br />make this a good flick
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The piano guys have done it again! Another amazing album perfect to bring the spirit of Christmas into your life. Amazing arrangements and a truly inspiring collection of pieces makes this album extraordinary!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This game is great! Really. If you've played Fire Maple's other point and puzzle games then you know what to expect. Mosaika plays through like an improved version of The Lost City, which is a great game its own right.<br /><br />What to expect:<br />This is a click through puzzle adventure. You basically tap through a series of screens (interactive images) which contain puzzles and clues/items which help you solve puzzles on other screens.<br /><br />As for the Game play:<br />Easy and intuitive. The map is easy to follow but it would be nice if you could jump to a certain screen rather than move back through the whole world.<br />Difficulty? I only got 'stuck' once and the in-game puzzles didn't take longer than 5 minutes to solve. Plus, if you ever get stuck there is a hint option which tells you the next move. I actually liked this since some moves weren't totally intuitive to me (like what to do with the mirror shard) and it let me play through the game without having to spend too much time clicking all over the place or trying to use my items anywhere and everywhere.<br /><br />Visuals:<br />This is a definite high point for Mosaika - kudos to the art director. The game is gorgeous and the added animations make for a much more immersive experience than their previous games. A beautiful, fun, whimsical improvement in the genre.<br /><br />The Story:<br />The story is not the focal point but there is enough to add a purpose to the game and the evil sorceress is a nice touch. Not really original or surprising but serviceable.<br /><br />While definitely not the most challenging entry into the genre (try The Haunt if you're looking for more challenge) this is a really great game. I picked it up as the FAOTD but if you're into the genre then it's definitely worth a few bucks.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This story is a perfect example of why reading the Camel Club books is so worthwhile.  Interesting characters.  Incredible story line.  Fast moving.  I just never know what's going to be next for John Carr/Oliver Stone, which is why I keep buying the books.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|PINES is a great start for a new series.  Another good book for those who enjoy being on the edge.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is great music and it's great to have the music videos on the dvd! Thank you The Piano Guys!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game on my Kindle better than one on computer. Play it on a daily basis. Great for waiting before appointment when there is too much going on to concentrate on reading.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this so that I could stream Netflix Super HD content to my front room, to replace a PS3 I was planning to sell that was currently performing the same purpose.<br /><br />I connected it to my network and enabled UPnP in my router, but Netflix videos were extremely pixelated and were clearly using a low bitrate. When I used Netflix's \\"Example Short 23.976\\" diagnostic video to see what was going on, I found that my streaming speed would never get close to the 5800kbps of Super HD (that my PS3 located inches away was currently providing), and instead topped out at ~3000kbps and would not go higher.<br /><br />In addition, sometimes the bitrate would \\"lock\\" at an extremely low value (usually around 250kbps) and would look absolutely terrible. Sometimes tracking through a title would fix this, but not always.<br /><br />I contacted Google's Chromecast support, who informed me that my unit \\"does not seem to be defective\\" and suggested \\"moving (your) router closer to the Chromecast\\". Given that I was able to stream Super HD content to both my PS3 and a laptop in that location without issue, this was not going to happen. It is my belief that my Chromecast was either defective or just sucked, and given the generally positive reviews posted here and elsewhere then I can only conclude the former.<br /><br />I am returning the unit to Amazon for a refund.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Loved the 1st Fruit Drops so got this also. Is a lot of fun & can be very addicting. Would recommend.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Such a simple game, with a nice amount of strategy and quick gameplay.  If you can get past the seemingly fruity storyline background, it's a great game.  The illustrations are nice, and you can't beat the price.  Don't expect to play this ALL night, but it's a wonderful leeway into other games.  Best for 4 players, but 3 works as well.  I have yet to try the variant rules for 2 players.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Streaming from Chrome Browser via the Google Cast Plugin doesn't work. Anyone know of a better solution? Youtube streaming is about all this thing is good for. Not really worth 35 bucks
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This Christmas collection is great for our whole family!  We absolutely love it!  Our children love to listen to the songs in the car & watch the videos at home.  It's calming & fun & reflective.  We love our Piano Guys!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game had me hooked in just a couple levels!! It's fun and not too challenging until you get to later levels.  I'm so glad that it's finally on my kindle.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It was a very good movie we enjoyed it.Unfortunately we had a glitch part way thru and had to call for assistance. The tech helped us and all was good.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Happy, family friendly, musical, emotional, colorful, holiday oriented movie. It's my personal favorite. great on a winter afternoon with a cup of cocoa.
0307454568|5.0|The trilogy of this story is one that you cannot put down.  The only difficult part is the names of the characters as many are similar.  If you came from Denmark this would not be an issue.  Still I would recommend this book and the other two.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|a little boring. I use it to fall asleep to. Other than that it loads quickly on my kindle about 90% of the time. The rest of the time it hangs up and I have to power down and back up to leave the mis-fired app.
B008476HBM|5.0|A Book we had to read in school but I read the Cliff Notes instead.  Now that I am older I appreciate the style of writing that has long since disappeared.  The story was well written and the use of the English language was remarkable.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great read.  The trials of daily life were felt, as well as heartache and the notion of what people do for love.  There was a time of slowness for me, but once I got to the end, it was definitely worth the wait!  Will look into other Liane Moriarty books!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent plot, characters and setting!!!  Not sure why they had to do away with some of the beloved characters though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great we'll written book, vivid imagery. Outstanding and it catches your mind and doesn't let go. Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|It was not one of Jennifer Anistons best movies. Would have been funnier with less cursing, more action and more comedy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35 I can't think of any reason why you shouldn't buy a Chromecast. I'm not going to write a novel repeating what everyone else has said. Just know that this little device is user-friendly, convenient, and reliable. I expected something so cheap to cast poor quality or laggy internet videos and webpages - boy was I wrong! I can even watch movies that I have saved on my laptop using the control+o command in chrome (so long as they are mp4 format of course), and the videos are crystal clear and run smoothly. I'm recommending this to all my friends.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|As always Donna tartt takes us into worlds few of us know first hand. Throwaway teens and rarified air of upper east antiques, melded together beautifully. Read it twice in a week.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|With a dinner party planned in 24 hours and a living room littered with preparations, I made the mistake of noticing that Michael Connelly's latest was ready for download.  I tried to resist but ... six hours later ... It was totally worth postponing real life.<br /><br />As usual, Mickey Haller's law firm is living hand to mouth when he accepts a client accused of murdering one of his former clients.  The accused murderer manages websites for prostitutes and shortly after he visits one of his clients to collect his fee, the client is found dead and the web designer is arrested.  The website guy calls Haller, saying the murdered woman had recommended him as a lawyer and while the designer admits he did go by to collect his fee and didn't get it it, he did not kill her.<br /><br />The cast is the usual band of eccentrics employed by Haller and there are the expected courtroom dramatics.  What makes Connelly so great is his ability to weave a story together from many components without having the whole thing run off the rails.  The pieces always fall into place, although there are some surprises along the way.  As always, a read until the end in one sitting kind of book.
B000SW4DXK|1.0|This movie would not play.  It kept buffereing.  The problem was not my system.  I had to watch it on Netflix instead.  Plus it was not the version I was trying to watch.  I wanted the one with Maureen Ohara. Very disappointing.<br />I could not find a place to ask for a refund.<br />- Paul
