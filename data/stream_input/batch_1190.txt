B002XMGGK6|4.0|What a bunch of kill-joys who panned this movie.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler do a pretty good job of keeping you guessing and in the seat of your chair to see what horrifying piece of the nightmare will unfold next.  Not for the faint-of-heart, but good, gory fun for the more discerning crime/thriller/justice drama/revenge fantasy viewer.  It was so good I watched it twice.  And I am NOT easy to please.<br /><br />Loving father and husband watches helplessly as wife and daughter are slaughtered...and he is left for dead...but he lives!  Ambitious young assistant D.A. cuts a deal with one of the murderers...and the other one serves some time (Loving Father thinks not enough/is probably right) and plans revenge for 10 years.  Against the murderers...and the...entire...justice system.  He is not wrong, but his actions are pretty indefensible.<br /><br />This is a great thriller. Not for kids.  Not a date movie.  But pretty good cathartic fun.  Ignore the bad reviews. This movie has its place.  Enjoy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the other reviews nail it. this is only the second time I&apos;ve  chosen to pay for  an app. glad i did. its good to have a timewaster that is engaging and calming at the same time.
0553801473|2.0|ADWD \\"Awards\\":<br /><br />Most engaging chapters: Tyrion<br /><br />Most events: Jon<br /><br />Most satisfying story arc: Theon and Asha Greyjoy<br /><br />Most progression: Bran<br /><br />Most confused, convoluted, complex: Dany / Quentyn / Selmy / Tyrion / Victarion<br /><br />Most boring: Dany and Tyrion<br /><br />Pointless: The Watcher & Melisandre<br /><br />Unsatisfying: Everything except the Greyjoys<br /><br />[....].<br /><br />Reason for my awards / review?  'Cause I'm opposite of impressed w/ ADWD. I was anticipating ASOS-material from the positive early reviews, but besides a couple of Tyrion chapters, I found this book yet another metaphorical chapter to a genre chock-full of bloated epic fantasy storytelling. I was expecting ASOS events, yet I was sadly disappointed by AFFC meanderings. Since this book parallels AFFC in many respects, I suppose it only fitting that the book suffers from similar failures in progress, resolution and satisfaction. I would like to put my official stamp of disapproval on this series which has deteriorated drastically from a stellar third book, A STORM OF SWORDS. In A STORM OF SWORDS, one shocking event after another seemed to move the book at a torrid pace. In A FEAST FOR CROWS and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, I was hard pressed to find events, much less any movement to the novel. In spite of it all, this book fares better than A FEAST FOR CROWS... a lot better. Sadly, that's not saying much.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessors, even if we were to take AFFC and ADWD together, there exists so few resolutions to any existing plots that the two latest novels cannot possibly stand on their own. Unlike its predecessors, AFFC and ADWD feel like bridge novels; nothing is resolved in a satisfying manner and more questions and plot tangents arise instead. Unlike his first three novels, none of the story arcs in AFFC and ADWD (with the possible exception of the Greyjoy story arc) contained endings unto themselves and yet left the reader wanting more.<br /><br />1. A GAME OF THRONES AGOT (4 / 5)<br />2. A CLASH OF KINGS ACOK (3 1/2 / 5)<br />3. A STORM OF SWORDS ASOS (5 / 5)<br />4. [...] AFFC (1 / 5)<br />5. [...]A DANCE WITH DRAGONS[/url] ADWD (2 / 5)
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is hilarious.  I was given this book as a gift right before I left for my first trip to Australia.  My only regret is that I didn't have time to read it all before planning the trip.  Bryson gives great hilarious insight into several key destinations on the continent.
B002RWKSII|5.0|What a perfect seletion for someone to finish some of the incomplete Gershwin pieces. Not only does Brian do a good job of finishing the work, he also does some very strong performances of some of the other tunes. A high light is \\"I Loves You Porgy\\", Brian's voice develops a soul that you don't nomally notice, he makes you feel like he is that young woman being called away from her man by the Masta, you feel her sadness and cry inside at her pain. Now for a singer to communicate those feelings through a record is quite a feat
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|No link anywhere to get troubleshooting help.  App search always shows no result - even when very common titles are searched.  I even tried the Bible!

0345529057|4.0|What an engrossing story!  I blazed through these four 1,000 page books in record time, unable to put them down.  The only minus is I discovered too late that the story is going to include seven volumes; to date only five have been published, with years between publishing dates.  Had I known, I may have waited to dive into this story, that continues from book to book.  Now I face years of waiting to find out how the story ends.

0143116738|5.0|Robinson, Ken. 2009. The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything. New York, NY: Penguin Books.<br /><br />Why is it that so many people are not content with what they are doing? According to Ken Robinson, it is because they have not discovered the \\"Element.\\"  This is simply \\"the meeting point between natural aptitude and personal passion\\" (21). After describing the Element in the first chapter, the author proceeds to show how one needs to \\"think differently\\" (the second chapter) particularly about the role of IQ to find success in life. The next two chapters develop an understanding of the Element by moving beyond imagination, finding the zone where you find yourself.<br /><br />In the remaining chapters, Robinson discusses finding people with a like passion, not worrying about what people think, and doing away with the idea that luck is the key.  In chapter eight, the author helps us understand the importance of \\"mentoring\\" and gives four roles for a helpful mentor.  The remaining three chapters speak to three concerns: first, is it too late to find one's passion, second, if I follow my passion will it be out of love or for money, and, third, the importance of reforming the educational process in the light of the Element.<br /><br />This book is well worth its modest price.  It shows the importance of discovering how one is wired in order to find true fulfillment and significance.<br /><br />I heard Robinson online through a recorded TED Conference where he quotes a poem that finishes \\"I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.\\"  All teachers and educators need to realize this lest they force people into a life where dreams are destroyed.

B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I purchased this 3D Blu-Ray package before the August 30th release date at another retailer that has it as an exclusive. This review is based solely on the 3D Blu-Ray version since I didn't catch the movie in the theater.     The 3D quality is excellent and much better than most of the 3D movies that are currently available. The CG animated animals and people of Rio de Janeiro come to life with added levels of depth and pop-out effects. The vibrant colors of the city and jungle landscapes match the outstanding quality of sound. The times when characters appear to come out of the TV isn't gimmicky or done solely for audience reaction. The 3D effects definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The sound quality is amazing and the musical sequences are spectacular.     I took a risk by buying a 3D movie that I hadn't seen before and I'm not disappointed with this purchase. The package comes with the 3D Blu-Ray disc, 2D Blu-Ray disc, DVD disc, and the Digital Copy disc. It's also one of the compatible \\"Pocket Blu\\" movies which lets you watch the movie and some of the bonus features on your mobile device and/or computer. Overall, I highly recommend this for people of all ages.
1582701709|5.0|You can carry away a ton of hope from this book. My life hasn't always worked so well in the past... but I'm ready to try something new and this is it! There are plenty of good reminders to be grateful for the things in your life that are blessings.
0743299795|4.0|While the book was published in the 1980s, it is still very valid. It's afterword addresses some of the changes in the intervening years. If you are interested in lean manufacturing this is a great history.
031603441X|4.0|Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room:  Keith Richards is really not a great person.  There seems to be a lot of people who did not like this book because Keith unapologetically did a lot of drugs, slept with a lot of people (and is generally stuck in a serious whore/madonna mindset), left his son with a person he knew to be completely unfit, was generally dismissive of most of the universe, crashed cars, regularly brandished knives and firearms, and is the king of rationalization.  I really don't see that any of that is relevant to how good the book is, though all those things are true.      The book is good, really good.  Keith writes like he talks.  He is funny, crass, smarter than he plays it, egotistical, a true rock star.  I (unlike his wife's family) would not be too happy if my daughter brought him home for dinner, but I would absolutely love to go out and have a drink or 12 with the guy. One of the things that surprised me is the depth of his musical knowledge and experimentation.  For me the msot interesting part of the book was the discussion of open tuning and not who slept with whom.  I am only a very casual Stones fan, who does not regularly listen to any of the albums other than Exile on Main Street and Beggars Banquet, but the book gave me a much greater appreciation for the music overall, and lead me to explore music from Keith's side projects.  All in all, as good a chroicle of the rock and roll workd of the 60's and 70's as you can find.  And occssionally a laugh out loud read to boot.    One side note --several people mention that it seems he hates Bill Wyman, but he only mentions him twice in the book I can recall, both times in passing.  I think he forgets he even exists.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|I had used the free version of ACX for awhile, and it was okay, but I prefer the &quot;Alarm Clock Plus&quot; that is only available at the Market. It has a very easy to use&quot;nap&quot; widget plus it tells you the time and the weather along with your alarm choice (mp3, app, ringtone, etc).  And it is free.
B0043P10CA|4.0|Ryuichi Sakamoto is one of Japan's most important artists. His long career encompasses film scores, pop albums, and electronica. Here we have a large collection of Sakamoto-san's most lovely melodies arranged for solo piano. Fans of Sakamoto will definitely want to have this, but this music will also appeal to those who enjoy relaxing piano music with somewhat melancholy tunes, perfect for thoughtful reflection or a rainy afternoon.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I loved PVZ for the PC, but imagine my disappointment when I find no zen garden, no mini games, the survival game mode has been neutered, etc.  This was a tremendous letdown, and I highly doubt popcap will ever make any updates.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I just purchased a Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller from Craigslist because I wanted to consolidate strollers and get rid of my umbrella stroller and full sized stroller.  But, my only problem with an umbrella-fold stroller is the lack of a parent tray ... and in my case, a cup holder.  Plus, I've heard that the P3 cup holder leaves a lot to be desired.  I found this buggy buddy on Amazon, and read that it works for the P3, and it sure does!  I hooked it through the integrated hooks on my stroller so that it wouldn't slide anywhere.  It is perfect.  The straps are a bit too long, but I just rolled them up before securing them.  It doesn't have to be removed when folding up the stroller.  I love the two cup holders ... and so do my older girls.  I also like that it will easily hold my cell phone and keys and other \\"trinkets\\" the kids pick up on our walks.  I had a travel mug of coffee in it today and it was just fine.  I like that it has metal around the edge to hold the shape, unlike some I've seen that collapse on themselves.  Great buy and very versatile!!  Highly recommend!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this application,  been using the free version for awhile.  It always wakes me up, and the features it offers is awesome.
B000FC13MM|3.0|The book, Sabriel is about a girl named Sabriel whose father is an Abhorsen and died. The duties are passed down to her and she has to save the world from the oncoming dead. This book is hard so I recommend it to the older age, such as 11 and up. This book is for people who like fantasy and adventure. My opinion of the book is that it is a well-written one, but it is hard and takes 20 chapters if not more to reach the final battle and then it ends in two chapters. Some vocabulary is Abhorsen: puts the dead to rest; Necromancer: brings the dead to life. So have fun reading the book!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Best one I&apos;ve found so far ... Includes and alarm clock and timer. I mainly use it just for the timer.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Has plenty of settings so it&apos;s easy to find whatever works best for you at any given time.\nI especially like the slider when setting the snooze length.\nThe use of math problems to snooze is a pretty cool idea. And being able to use math problems to dismiss alarm a great way to wake up if you so desire is even cooler....lol\nTry it you&apos;ll more than likely find it to be a.very useful app. If not delete it.\n\n
0393061310|5.0|The author makes a good case for his claim that the early inhabitants of Eurasia benefits from geographical factors that were largely absent in Africa and the Americans.  The fact that Eurasia extends much farther along its East/West axis than along its North/South direction allows any domesticated plant or animal to find an similar climate from one end of the vast contiguous landmass to the other.  As the distance from Vladivostok to Lisbon is much greater than the distance from New York to Los Angles, or any East/West distance in South America or Africa, the ability to transfer crops and livestock to equivalent climates was much more limited in continents other than Eurasia.  Add the much greater land area of Eurasia compared to other continents, and you see that you would expect a much greater variety of plant and animal species.<br /><br />This greater variety of domesticated plants and animals then added to the advantages of greater population in Eurasia.  This greater variety advanced Eurasian technological supremacy and contributed to the diseases and the associated immunity of the people of that landmass.  When the Europeans then made contact with the Americas and Africa, if their superior technology did not win the day the devastating diseases that they carried certainly did!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app has replaced the use of my alarm clock.  I like all of the customizable features. I would not say that it now keeps from ever being late to work,  but the hard math problems most of the time make me think way more than I would like to and help me get up.  I really like the increasing volume feature that allows me to wake more naturally.
B004LWZW24|3.0|3.5 stars.<br /><br />Luckily, before viewing this movie, all I heard from a few friends about \\"Insidious\\" was that it was entertaining and creepy. I wasn't told it was great or extremely frightening or awesome. Sometimes feedback about a movie can leave us expecting something brilliant. This film was fun but not great. It is not original; you've seen most of this before in other scary films... but it was entertaining, especially the first part (before the seance people entered the picture).<br /><br />Watching this film unfold gives you the thrilling feeling that you have no idea what might happen next, or what you might see next. It gives the audience an unsettling vibe that is a vital ingredient that many horror films are sorely lacking. The first half of the movie has a deliberately slow and sinister pace and tone. It works very well. You are off guard, unsure of what to look at or what's going on.<br /><br />But once the pace quickens, once they start showing more than hinting at, it changes the whole mood of the thing, and that's what leaves me disappointed. Once in a while a horror film comes along with tons of potential in its start, but then things don't quite live up to the build-up. I'm reminded of another horror movie, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" (2001), which  begins with such promise but then rapidly sinks into typical and predictable horror territory.<br /><br />\\"Insidious\\" strikes me as a fairly effective spookshow, warts and all (some of the demons are cheesy, some of the comic relief fails). It's above average compared to most modern horror cinema offerings, but it could have succeeded even moreso for me had it maintained its initial ominous and unpredictable flavor. I guess it's a case where I find myself asking for the moon when I have the stars.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is amazing. It will wake almost anyone up. I don&apos;t know what I would do without it! The math problems ensure thay you wake up enough to process the time.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|i found this app a few months ago. just needed an alarm with buttons and i hated htcs alarm clock with a slider. having a large snooze button and small dismiss button is genius. i also love the gradually increasing volume on alarms. mornings are nicer now.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I don't do a lot of reviews, but when I see a developer putting forth the effort to actually reply to concerns raised by people who are rating apps 1-star simply because they think they've seen it before for free, that really says something to me about the kind of people they are.  They are the sort of people I like to support and I wish more developers, and even corporations, were so forward and generous with their human resources.<br /><br />I didn't need an alarm, but now I have one that actually functions quite well and does a lot more than the stock alarm option I had before.  So when I do need one on my phone, I know what I'll be using.  And when I see an Angle Labs app in the future I know I'll give it more than a passing glance before deciding whether or not to purchase/download.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|i&apos;ve been using the free version of this ap for months now. i chose the theme song from the 1970&apos;s doctor who show.  wakes me up EVERY time!!  especially with the crescendo option. freaky but works for me. the do math problems option is not for me. if anything it ticks me off. i just don&apos;t use it. see simple common sense. the Dev did a really good job on this! as far as i am concerned this is THE BEST alarm clock ap there is.period. done.  Ty Amazon! as for the paranoid among us....seriously if you have any rfid chips anywhere. TPTB know where you are. so why piss and moan about the cell phone when your CC, clothing and other posessions have these chips? if your that bad off ? go off the grid get rid of all tech and live in a cave somewhere.  even thats not fullproof for you? but it&apos;s a start!  *LOL* CHEERS!

B0058VW36U|5.0|Pretty fun, completed the first box and have to say trying to get 3 stars is addicting and a great time waster\n
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I gladly paid for it. you&apos;d be nuts to pass up on this app while it&apos;s free. the app is updated frequently, and the devs are responsive to feedback and requests for help. I prefer to set music as my alarm sounds; you can even tell the app to randomly choose a song from a particular artist.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|This is the second alarm I have seen offered as faotd, the first was Gentle Alarm (which I use every day). I had the free version of this and it is great for those days when you know you will not be able to wake up! \nI prefer gentle alarm because of my sleep style, but Extreme is great for those who are deeper and harder sleepers. I find the stock htc alarm clock to not be half as useful for me. This alarm will wake you up! This is the alarm clock my younger (31 year old) brother needs!
B0011ZTWI4|5.0|Sure it's different from the first two albums, but change isn't always bad, if anything it could be good. This is my personal favorite Slipknot album.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|I love this app, well, at least the free version. I set it to play a random song from artist, and then to play unknown artist but it only plays some stock ringtone from my phone. the free version does allow for me to play the songs. but oh well. I guess I&apos;ll be sticking with the free version
B001E780W8|4.0|I Personalty really liked All Hope Is Gone. Sure it's even more different from Vol. 3, but like I said in my review of that album change isn't always bad. And I hope their next album will be even better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but after five minutes with SwiftKey I was hooked. It has increased my screen-based typing dramatically, to the point that I rarely use the physical keyboard. \n\nI couldn&apos;t stand Swype, and have tried several other keyboard apps but SwiftKey outshines them all. The best part is that the more I use it the better it learns my typing and even amazes me by predicting what I frequently type in SMS messages! Worth every penny. \n\nTake the time to set it up and have it learn from your SMS and mail entries. Once you do you will find that this keyboard is amazing.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|my grandfather made the real thing when I was a child.   this game lets you play far more than one table.   just wish I had a pile of wooden tables around to play.   until then,  this is better!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is my go to alarm clock. I just set it and forget it. Love the crescendo effect for music. This a great app that u dont have to fool with too many settings. very easy to use. GalaxyS.
0345529057|5.0|Very good books. The first one is very similar to the tv show on HBO, I expect the other 3 bookds to match up to the show when it resumes.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|I was surprisingly disappointed with this movie as I love Synder's other films but \\"Sucker Punch\\" suffers from style over substance throughout its entirety. While the effects are great & the film itself is very picturesque & beautiful, its like your watching a two hour music video or a video game. I thought I was watching the Animatrix after about thirty minutes into the movie. While its purposefully over the top with it's mash up of genres it still seems to lack that ambitious appeal that 300 & Watchmen had. Oh well, can't win 'em all.
055357342X|3.0|I loved this first three books, and give them 5 stars.  However,  I wanted to jump into following the story from the previous books.  I'm only half way through this one, but it's just not keeping my interest like the others.  There are too many new characters when I just want to finish up with my old ones.
B0063TX06I|4.0|I knew if I held out long enough I'd get it at a fair price. For years Amazon has been trying to sell me this for $100+, now I get it for $4.99 I'm glad I waited. As for the CD, I used to own the LP back in the day but it had been 30 years since I'd heard it. It brought back alot of great memories of \\"the good ol' days\\"
B004LWZW24|1.0|Insidious is yet another in a long line of horror movies that get a lot of hype and praise, but is boring and not scary in the least. I'm getting tired of these horror movies that take themselves too seriously. I miss the horror movies of the 80's and 90's. They had a sense of fun and humor to them. These days, everything is so pretentious and it just leaves me cold. Insidious is every bit as boring as Paranormal Activity. I recommend watching White Chicks instead. Now that was scary!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Can&apos;t even describe how handy this alarm is! I had the free version for about a year now and more that I can get those pesky ads out if the way I see nothing impairing! The only thing I warn people is that if your media volume is low or off, that volume will be THE MAX VOLUME for the phone alarm. So as long as you check the volume before you go to bed it should work just fine :-) !!
038572179X|5.0|I don't think there's much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I just wanted to add more kudos to this brilliant novel. I read this after checking out a list of the best novels of the past century, and I firmly believe it deserving of the top spot. \\"Atonement\\" is so beautifully written that I cried not only because of the way it ended, but because I was finished. Highly recommended!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I missed this as the free app of the day the first time, so I&apos;m excited to see it offered again.  I&apos;ve been using the ad-version for a couple months now and I love it! I still hit the snooze button, but not nearly as long, and because I like to. I have it set for only a 5-minute snooze and it reduces the snooze duration by 1-minute each time. Plus, I start with only solving one math problem and have it set to give me one extra math problem for every time I hit snooze. \n\nFor those who are wondering, the difference between the paid version and the free version is that the free version is ad-supported. Now that I have the paid version, I won&apos;t accidentally hit that evil little ad banner that pops up where the &quot;dismiss&quot; button belongs.  Thanks for the FAOTD Amazon!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I wasn't impressed. Maybe it's because I'm older now, and my humor has changed, but I now adore this film. It has such a sweet humor to it, and a few moments that I'll laugh out loud about just thinking of. I know a lot of theaters across the country used to hold \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" nights where people would come in dressed like the characters and throw stuff at the screen. I think this movie would be a perfect modern update to that tradition. I'd love to go dressed as Deb, and throw Tina's dinner at the screen!
0385341008|4.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is another one of those books that languished on my to-be-read list. The book is so popular that it was always out at my library. When I went to the Random House Readers Circle tea in May, they gave us the most wonderful bag of swag, and \\"The Guernsey Literary\\" was one of the books I took home. I finally picked it up the other day, after my library book queue had dwindled down, and I am kicking myself for not pushing to read it sooner. This is a beautiful story of community and love of people and of books, and I was left with a feeling of warmth that still remains with me three days later.<br /><br />The book is written in epistolary form and tells the story of Juliet, an author who gained some fame during World War II by writing a darkly humorous column for a London newspaper. Just as Juliet is casting about for something new and a bit more serious to write about, she receives a letter from Dawsey, a man who lives on Guernsey and who got her old address from a used copy of essays by Charles Lamb. He mentions a literary society that he and other islanders formed during the war to help cope with the German occupation, and Juliet has to learn more. Soon, she's communicating with practically the entire island, and when she thinks there might be able to use their experiences in her new book, Juliet decides to visit Guernsey for herself, not knowing that she'll be thoroughly embraced by the people and that she'll learn things about their lives during the war that will tie her to the island forever.<br /><br />There is so much about this book that is so wonderful. First is the subject matter. I knew a bit about the occupation of Guernsey and Jersey, not from the numerous history classes I took for my degree, but from watching episodes of Antiques Roadshow on BBC! The authors are right that this part of history often gets lost, and they did a great job of educating readers while putting a human spin on the whole experience. There were many times where I just stopped and thought how close the Germans were to mainland England, and how frightening that was. And the passages about the bombing of the island and the evacuation of the children were heartbreaking.<br /><br />Second, this book celebrates how a shared passion can get a group of people through even the darkest of times. Mary Ann Shaffer says in the acknowledgments that she intended the message to extend over all the arts, but this story is really about the power of reading, and as someone who was once a book club member and who bonds with people all over the internet with a shared love of books, AND who wants to work with books for the rest of her life, I can say that I've experienced that power, and it was incredible to read about it.<br /><br />But the true heart of this story is the characters. These people are so different and so quirky and so real, and it's a joy to see things through their eyes. By the end of the book, you want to know the members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and you want to know how to secure a membership for yourself.<br /><br />My mother did point out one thing that might frustrate readers about this book, and that is that it might end a little abruptly for some. I felt that all loose ends were tied up and that the authors revealed all they needed to reveal and that all that was left to do was finish the story, but I can see how others might wish to know a bit more.<br /><br />The bittersweet note to this is that Mary Ann Shaffer passed away before she could experience the success of this book. I'm so glad that she told this story, and now I really want to make a trip to Guernsey and see the place that inspired her so much.ny times where I just stopped and thought how close the Germans were to mainland England, and how frightening that was. And the passages about the bombing of the island and the evacuation of the children were heartbreaking.    Second, this book celebrates how a shared passion can get a group of people through even the darkest of times. Mary Ann Shaffer says in the acknowledgments that she intended the message to extend over all the arts, but this story is really about the power of reading, and as someone who was once a book club member and who bonds with people all over the internet with a shared love of books, AND who wants to work with books for the rest of her life, I can say that I've experienced that power, and it was incredible to read about it.    But the true heart of this story is the characters. These people are so different and so quirky and so real, and it's a joy to see things through their eyes. By the end of the book, you want to know the members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and you want to know how to secure a membership for yourself.    My mother did point out one thing that might frustrate readers about this book, and that is that it might end a little abruptly for some. I felt that all loose ends were tied up and that the authors revealed all they needed to reveal and that all that was left to do was finish the story, but I can see how others might wish to know a bit more.    The bittersweet note to this is that Mary Ann Shaffer passed away before she could experience the success of this book. I'm so glad that she told this story, and now I really want to make a trip to Guernsey and see the place that inspired her so much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It takes me a few tries to get the harder levels,  but it&apos;s a nice puzzle to replay and pretty to boot.  Lovely menu scenes too.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|Not their best effort. The lack of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman really hurt them a lot in this endeavor.
0553801473|1.0|I remember finishing \\"Storm of Swords\\" like some people remember the Kennedy assassination.<br />I know exactly where I was and how loud I screamed, and I couldn't wait to read the next book. The wait felt agonizing, and I practically kicked down the door of my local bookstore when \\"A Feast for Crows\\" hit the shelves. Within four pages I was engrossed, but thought Martin's decision to split the narrative was a rotten one, and couldn't believe that no one was able to stop him. Perhaps his publishers were so eager to see the next book in print they didn't care that Martin was suddenly writing like a rambling old man tanked on tranquilizers. After years of waiting I kinda gave up on the prospect of the final book ever becoming my mind candy, but when I spotted it at the bookstore I couldn't resist. Sixty pages deep I was bored out of my mind, and started skimming and skipping chapters - which resulted in missing absolutely nothing. Instead of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" this book should be called \\"A Wish for Washy\\" since page after page is dedicated to meandering conversations between suddenly flummoxed characters incapable of toddler-level decision making. I can't believe how bloated this book is with meaningless, empty interactions between characters Martin has clearly forgotten as much as I had. Instead of rooting for my favorite characters I found myself hoping one would stumble upon blueprints for the sort of advanced weaponry that would wipe out the entire cast in a single swoop, and spare the world any further sequels.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This film is one of my all-time favorite kid films since E.T.. It was fun and hilarious and a must-have. It also has a great commentary with the whole cast and pretty good special features.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Granted there is only so much you can do with an Alarm Clock App. But I have had this one for a while now. It's a great app that always works even on my rooted phone. There are some cool options you can do and play around with. Nicely designed and nicely executed.<br /><br />The one and only problem I have with this App is that it keeps a icon in the notification bar on the top left side. It is a kind of pain because if I have an alarm set for 6AM every morning this week.. ALL week I will have an alarm notification in the bar and also in the top of the drop down. It is a pain for me because I am always modding my phone to get the most out of it and I love the minimalistic look and an alarm notification on the left gets annoying. But for some reason I don't mind when the Android Alarm is on the right side.. huh lol<br /><br />But none the less a great app. I would get it since its free today and just try it out. If you don't like it then uninstall. Also, for me at least, I can use this app and the Android Alarm at the same time.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Spoiler Alert<br /><br />To start off, I gave this a 2 out of 5 compared to the 5 star material of the first three books. Compared to other books I would give it a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />My initial feeling after reading the book was a mild satisfaction. But as I began to review what happened in the book, I couldn't think of one major event that happened to further the plot, which lead to the overall dissatisfaction of reading it. The read was enjoyable only because of the structure that GRRM has already built.(and the renewed hope at the start of each chapter that something BIG was going to happen in that chapter)<br /><br />Judging by the title, I assumed that dragons or \\"Dragons\\"(as in Dany)would make a huge impact in this book such as finally arriving in Westeros. As the book ended, Dany was farther off reaching her goal than when the book started. I could accept that outcome easier if the plot moved forward in any other way.<br /><br />I finished the read a few days ago and I am still depressed about how ADwD turned out. I hope Martin re-energizes this series with The Winds of Winter.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|My girlfriend and I have been using the free version for a while now. We both like the crescendo feature, which neither of our stock alarms have. As well, my stock doesn't allow the selection of a music file as the alarm. For those that like the snooze button, it's pretty damn big on the screen. The \\"dismiss\\" button is small, so it's not easy to just turn off. It can require you to solve math problems to snooze it, and then increase the number you have to solve for the next snooze.  In case you want to bash our phones; Her's is a ROOTED Inspire running 2.3.4 and sense 3.0, mine is a rooted Google G2 running 2.3.4. Nice try though*.     I'm not sure what else could be added to make this app that much better. Perhaps crescendo the screen to become brighter, or just light up, over time. I don't know if this app is worth the regular price, 99 cents seems more like it.     I do recommend this alarm to people, the crescendo feature along is great to wake-up to. Since it's free today, we've been telling friends to get it.   If you have issues waking up with alarms, sleeping through them, or just getting up in general, you might want to see a doctor about that...also, you could be dead, and/or a zombie. If the latter is true, prepare for the Rule #2 - The Double Tap**.     *I was NOT asked to do  5 star rating, I do not know where these people came up with being asked to do so.   I DO NOT work for the company, I work for a book publisher in Texas.     **See Zombie World, a great movie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It actually works pretty good. The alarm sound can start out quiet and slowly get louder until there&apos;s no way you could sleep through it.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I thought this was going to be similar to his other movie he did when he played the martian.  This should let everyone that don't know how great of an actor Jim really is.  Great Job.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|purchased, but have not installed. i am kind of afraid because of all the fake reviews and suspect permissions. why does it need to read phone calls and storage?
B0000Z0HMQ|1.0|I purchased this video without knowing that a DVD made in the UK will not play on American DVD players. It requires a multi-regional player, which is hard to find and expensive. I contacted the seller and he stated that he would refund the purchase price, but not shipping. No problem, I can understand that. However; I returned the DVD and I have not heard from him, nor has he responded to emails.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|i was going to buy this on fri but was delighted it was app of the day.. great app\nwords words words words
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This has realy helped me get out of bed in the morning.  Who knew shaking a phone to snooze an alarm would be so effective?
0062060554|5.0|The suspense just builds with every page!I couldn't wait to find out what happened next but then I was so disappointed when I finished and there was no more to read!Amazing, fascinating read. Best suspense/thriller I've read all year!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have used this app every day for over a year, I even paid for it on the other marketplace that shall not be named. I have multiple alarms set for the days I need them set, the slowly rising volume of the alarm is a great feature.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|What is &quot;xtreme&quot; about this app? I see very little difference between this and the stock alarm.  Gentle alarm is xtreme.\n
0545123275|2.0|I started reading this book because I heard it was going to be made into a movie and I like to read the books before I see the movies. But this book was just so boring. Angsty teenage love story with some unique werewolf mythology thrown in. Thats it. The character of Grace was poorly witten,  such stilted dialoge and ridiculous thought process that I was laughing at the words written on the page. \\"I was drunk with Sam\\" is just one little example. I think the author was trying to make Grace funny with a silly, unique personality but it just didnt work. The character of Sam is a little more well thought out. He seems to have a funny sense of humor and is a charming but normal, flawed boy. He is very emo with his fear of bathtubs and guitar playing, but the emo/sadness seems normal for a boy who was turned into a werewolf as a child. It was as if another author had written the Sam chapters.     It was just too much annoying teenage angst for me and not enough action. Sam and grace are just too selfish and focused on each other to care about the people who might actually need their help.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|I got this for free for the day,  but DO NOT GET this app. It is the exact same thing as the alarm on the phone already.
055357342X|5.0|This book is perfection from cover to back. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones the TV show, you owe it to yourself to read this. It's possibly the most engaging and easy to read of this 5 book series. Without spoiling anything, let's just say the whole world of Westeros turns upside down, characters you likely loathe get what's owed to them and some admirable characters meet despicable ends.    5/5 and I plan to reread very soon!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app has not been offered as the free app of the day. The previous alarm app was Gentle Alarm. I&apos;m still amazed and appalled by the reviewers who rate these apps poorly thinking Amazon is trying to promote some mass conspiracy to track your location and listen to your calls. Read the features, morons. Most every app will need access to your phone calls in order to allow calls to come through while the app is running. This isn&apos;t hard to understand.  5 stars to compensate for the tin foil hat reviews.
B005529BDK|5.0|I got this when it was the free game of the day.  When my other phone went south I immediately thought of buying this for my new phone but did nt have to.   I love trying to beat my old scores and getting longer chains.  This is perfect to kill time at the car wash, post office, traffic lights (jk).\n
0452289963|5.0|In A New Earth, Eckhart Tolle draws from the teaching of many religious leaders. Instead of focusing on religious traditions Tolle focuses primarily on what William James would call religious personalities, and Tolle is undoubtedly one himself.<br /><br />Quoting William James in regards to religious personalities: \\"Thus, when a superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce - as in the endless permutations and combinations of human faculty, they are bound to coalesce often enough- in the same individual, we have the best possible condition for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries. Such men do not remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their ideas possess them, they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their companions or their age.\\"<br /><br />Tolle borrows heavily from the teachings of two figures you are already familiar with: Jesus and Buddha, and also delves into Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christian Gnosticism. Almost everyone is familiar with these figures and movements, and that familiarity makes his message very accessible.<br /><br />Tolle, however, also draws upon another stranger tradition, one that has its roots in the Theosophical school of Madame Blavatsky, namely through the work and teaching of Jiddu Krishnamurti. Krishnamurti is an interesting figure, he lived recently and there are youtube videos of him giving public lectures and being interviewed. He advocates some of the same fundamental concepts as Tolle, for instance, the focus on being present is one of the main concerns of both men. If you haven't read either of them, the idea of being present is a great concept, and one that I use in my life.<br /><br />Basically, being present just means focusing on your senses and surroundings, rather than focusing on your inner monologue. For instance, and this is a paraphrase, Tolle asserts that there is no such thing as a problem when you are present, just a situation. Most of us can handle complicated situations, but complicated problems wear us down and destroy us. Therefore, a simple shift of perspective regarding how you view time can change the way you live from being based in problems - into being based in situations. This was a fundamental improvement in my life.<br /><br />An idea that Tolle doesn't mention specifically but probably influenced him is Krishnamurti's teaching that the things you feel are you. That's deceptively simple, but he gives a good example based on the emotion of fear. When you experience fear, you feel as though something is making you afraid.  On closer examination, however, the fear is located completely within your own body and thoughts. This is an interesting point, because if the fear and you are identical, can't you manage the fear?<br /><br />They both also make fascinating points regarding what it means to enjoy life. How experiencing something by giving it your full attention is the way to be happy, as opposed to wanting to own and control things - which is really the desire for permanence. Desiring permanence is a rabbit hole that leads to unhappiness and not actually experiencing anything, because you are always wanting more and not focusing on what you do have. They both explain this better.<br /><br />This is a really great book. If you are interested in further reading check out books by Jiddu Krishnamurti (a bunch are on audible audio books for like 6 bucks), although Krishnamurti is not nearly as entertaining or understandable he makes some life changing points if you are willing to ruminate with the texts.can handle complicated situations, but complicated problems wear us down and destroy us.

0553801473|3.0|I finally finished the book, and while I have to admit there are a few great television moments, my overa-all reaction is, \\"Meh\\".<br /><br />This book was slightly better than the last one, although I liked the last one a lot more on a second reading, but I agree with all the people who feel that Martin is dragging this out.  It would be easier to not worry about it were it not for the fact that it will be another fifteen years minimum before we finally get the finale.<br /><br />And whatever enjoyment I was getting from reading was frequently interrupted by my need to quell my rage over Martin's *constant* usage of the phrase, \\"much and more\\" or \\"little and less\\".  It is a cute phrase used once, but when it pops up every third paragraph, it gets seriously irritating.  It is a stupid and lazy literary quirk that Martin ought to fix.  And any editor worth his salt ought to have called him on it.  Of course it does not destroy the book.  The book is still quite enjoyable.<br /><br />I am getting a bit tired of Martin's shtick too.  Oh, look who just got stabbed.  Sigh.  I bet HE won't get resurrected a-la Dondarrion.<br /><br />The book is worth a read, but in the end it just made me sad.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|...for my taste, Gentle Alarm is better. After years of being jolted awake by alarms, I much prefer the slow, quiet approach.\n\nIf you decide to oversleep, you can still do it after entering a math problem.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The variety of snooze options and button sizes makes this hard to beat.  I've used it for the past month and it goes off without fail.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I don&apos;t know how any alarm clock app could get 5 stars. It makes noise at a certain time and you either decide to get up or not.\n\nThis app isn&apos;t going to wake someone that doesn&apos;t want to get up no matter what.\n\nAnyone that says different is fooling themselves.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|This app is does nothing more than the stock alarm application. I was told to post a five star review, but I do not think this app deserves it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I got this app the first time it was free on the market. I use it exclusively for my alarms as it has the highest level of customization and reliability. Rather than complain about it being offered again, I will just recommend it wholeheartedly. Though I do wonder, why the same app twice? Still 5 stars.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app has been offered for free previously at this app store, that&apos;s how I acquired it, I do have this alarm clock installed on my Sprint EVO, I use it every day and I love it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|**  VERY IMPORTANT:  If you purchase this microphone and you don't get ANY sound, you need to purchase a MONO to STEREO adapter (a few bucks from Amazon or local retailer).  These adapters are so cheap that I would suggest picking one up at the time of purchase just in case.<br /><br />I ordered this product after seeing good reviews and because I own other Audio-Technica products and have been extremely happy with them.  I ordered from Amazon and it came a couple days later.  I opened it up and started taking getting it ready.  This mic requires the LR44 batteries so I'd suggest picking up a few of those when you purchase the headset too because they last about a dozen hours before dying.<br /><br />I plugged it into my camera, no go.  I tried another mic and it worked fine.  I plugged it into my PC, no go.  I tried the other mic and it worked fine.  I thought it was a loose connection, bad sound card, maybe I put the battery in wrong?  Nothing I did would fix it so I ended up starting a return on Amazon, frustrated that it didn't work.  I went to lunch, came back and as I'm looking at the plug for the microphone I realize that it's a mono plug.  I ran down to a local electronics store and purchased a 3.5mm Stereo Male to 3.5mm mono female adapter.<br /><br />I plugged in the adapter and lo and behold it works perfectly with my PC as well as my camera.  I have a feeling a lot of the 1 star reviews and returns on here have been because people didn't know that they needed this for their application (note that some people may NOT need this, especially with more professional equipment).
B000PKG7I4|5.0|The only song I had ever heard was Rehab, and I liked it.  I have always loved that sound.  Always meant to buy Back to Black, but never got around to it.  When she died, I wanted to know more about her.  I was up all night reading about her on my iPhone, listening to her on Pandora and YouTube, and searching the internet every few minutes for updates.  I fell in love with her style and sound.  Some say it's not original, but she made it HER own.    Frank and Back to Black are different views of the same person.  In Frank, I hear that youthful, sweet, innocent yet street smart voice of a young girl whose music and creativity was much older than her years.  In Back to Black, I hear the polished, experienced, confident but vulnerable voice of a young woman.  I find both of the CDS fantastic, and I find it hard to say Back to Black is better.  It's different.  They are both excellent, but different.    Buy them both.  You won't be disappointed.    I hope she finds peace and love.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|What I like about Amazon&apos;s free app of the day is it allows those of us who love the Android platform to test out a bunch of paid apps so we can review them and hopefully make the app community better.  Sure, you will find some spoild little children not old enough to have their own credit card attatched to an Amazon account.  Sure you will get some stupid spoiled hipster who is just angry there parents didn&apos;t buy them an iPhone so they look cool.  Sure there are those bagles who expect things for free like they are gods gift to the world.  Overall though most people realize this is an opportunity to test a bunch of apps and report back with valid, constructive, and thorough reviews.  For the rest of you spoild brat types mentioned above, go die in a fire.\n\nWith all of that said, I think this app lacks a lot of features that other similar apps have incorporated.  Compare it to Gentle Alarm and you will find its much less advanced.  The only real feature this has over my stock alarm is the math feature.  I don&apos;t believe that one feature makes it worth running an extra app on your phone that duplicates an already built in feature.  Sure there are a few other minor changes but overall this brings nothing new to the table.  It&apos;s worth it to try as a free app but after today unless they add new features, I dont think it&apos;s worth the money to be a paid app.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve had this clock since I got my andriod.  Used the free version for months and never failed then I bought the application.  Glad it&apos;s a FAOTD. You can have multiple alarms and you can have different songs to wake you up. LOVE IT!
1582701709|2.0|The book was constantly telling you the same thing.  Quite Redundant!  I got bored with it and didn't finish it completely.  I have done the practices illlustrated and nothing yet.  I am not skeptical regarding the contents of this book, however, I'm disappointed how I feel about the read.
0345529057|5.0|Got into these after watching season 1 of the series on TV    the books are amazing, cannot wait to see them turned into such a top notch tv show
0061743526|5.0|A fantastic book about childhood and the lost of innocence.  I've bought it at the same time than \\"In cold blood\\" by Truman Capote.  Harper Lee and him were friends, as you may discover if you're watching the biopic made by Bennett Miller in 2005.   Philip Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his performance in it.   Catherine Keener was playing Harper Lee's character in that. Great film, by the way.  So, since I've seen this movie, I've wanted to read in \\"Cold blood\\".  In my English Librairy here in Quebec City, both books were side by side.  This is a great story, narrated by a young female (seven to nine years old) living in Alabama in mid 1930s.  It's funny and touching.
159668139X|5.0|Deborah Chandler gives her prospective weavers an excellent overview and also detailed descriptions along with<br />photos of the steps you need to know to begin.  As well there are extensive discussions of advanced<br />problems along with an index.  She cautions us along the way to read and reread.  I find it easier to learn<br />a craft from watching someone show me, but this book is a very good beginning. I think I will be using<br />it and reusing it often.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I don&apos;t need to download this version because I have the free version. However, this ap is far superior to my stock alarm. I have trouble waking (@0430) but because I now have to solve math problems to shut it up, I don&apos;t over sleep any longer.   \n I recommend getting this if your stock alarm is garbage. Play in the settings and see how you like it. Don&apos;t give it one star if YOU don&apos;t need a new alarm clock, because some of us need to upgrade.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is a great epic series, but can anyone tell me exactly what was the secret about Clenham's mother, I couldn't understand the Frenchman when he was bringing it out  \\"jaxico99@yahoo.com\\"
B000DZIGDU|1.0|This is the worst war movie ever made.  It is full of every idiot cliché that could be crammed into a movie of this type.  The private standing up and getting machine gunned in training is a vey old stick.  Fact is that I've done the old low crawl across the course while machine guns fired overhead and small charges of C-4 were set off and I did it at night.  It's more \\"fun\\" that way.  Didn't anybody panic.  And no, we were not elite soldiers - just a bunch of ordinary guys going through Army basic in 1963.  That sadistic staff sergeant in movie - what a crock.  Yes, there are Army and Marine sergeants who are tough on the people they command.  However, the actions of the staff sergeant in the movie was so far out of realty as to be pathetic.  About the only good part of this movie were the scenes of \\"grab ass\\" and the stress of doing nothing.  The rest of it was pure male bovine droppings and a disservice to the marines.  Frankly, I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|I purchased this item to hook my Macbook Air up to my TV to use as a monitor.  The picture is absolutely amazing, as I would expect nothing less from apple and HDMI, but this adapter does its job.  Although, I bought this adapter specifically to minimize the cables from my laptop to my tv, utilizing the audio output the adapter offered.  Problem is, not all TVs support the audio output, and I didn't even think about that when I bought it.  So if you do buy this product, make sure to check and see if your tv supports it.  Luckily I was in the market for a new tv, so we'll see if a brand new tv will support the hdmi audio output.  Overall a great adapter if you have the right tv!! :)
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Don&apos;t listen to the morons who rate it one star just to do it. This app works great! I&apos;ve been using it for months now and I love it!
1451629184|5.0|I read this book only after watching Jaycee interviewed on TV by Diane Sawyer.  She struck me as a very resilient beautiful person and I wanted then, to read her story.  I was not disappointed.  I am so sorry Jaycee was kidnapped and went through this experience.  Her story is  heartwrenching.  The person who emerged from this captive life, after much ongoing therapy in which she learned this was not Her shame, but his, is very inspirational.  That her desire is to help others now, says so much about Jaycee.  I wish you and your family all the best, Jaycee!!
B004DMIIUU|1.0|I must say i'm really tired of all these so-called 'action' movies with fake artificially sped up (or slowed down for that matter) fight scenes.  The reason I'm dissappointed is that the director's previous movie, the theatrical length version of his superhero movie Casshern was great.  There were some certainly instances of some nice cinematography in Goemon, but certainly not enough to make up for bad action, and very average acting and writing.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|i got this as fre app of day and love it. i prob wouldnt have come accross it otherwise and didnt even know i needed it. ive had it over a week and love it. im an organization freak, so ive now got everything on my homescreens organized into folders. i love all the options for folder icons too.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|This is a tough film to review. It plays on three levels, one conscious, the other two sub-conscious. Most of this films plays on the two sub-conscious levels, which are indeed pure fantasy. To me it's the major flaw of the film, although in truth, the best parts of the film are in the fantasy/escape parts. Seems our heroine isn't really that tough, mentally or physically in the real world, so she creates two separate worlds in her mind, that allows her to escape her real fate. Now the pure fanboy/action sci-fi fan in me loved this movie for what it was, hot chicks in cute/hot outfits, kicking butt, against everything you/I could imagine. Unfortunately none of it is really real, making the film tedious and predictable when the guns, knifes, and swords are put away.    Now I've never been much of a gamer, so I wasn't sure if I'd like the look of the film at all. Visually, this film is simply stunning. By far the best part of the film, with the action scenes coming in second. And I will give props to Emily Browning. For such a small women, her action sequences and fight scenes in this film are really good. I mean I'm not sure how much of it was really her, and how much may have been CGI, but I was very impressed by her. Be interesting to see if she does anymore actions films soon.     Not sure I'm gonna buy it, this was a rental for me. Just felt the main storyline was more interesting from a storyline standard, yet mostly avoided. It was mostly fun to watch though.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|too bad such a great series had to end so limply. the last long awaited book, artificially held back, obviously to coincide with the hbo series and create exta hype, has absoultely no real meat at all. it was the opposite of hard to put down. it was hard to pick back up, most of the time. in some places i felt like i was reading a cereal box for something to do.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve been using the free version if this for a long time, and it&apos;s really great. Tons of customization options. I am not really sure what the benefits would be for the paid version, but I definitely recommend the free one or this one while it&apos;s free app of the day.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've tried most(at least 90%) of the alarm clock apps available, and Alarm Clock Extreme SOOOO much better than all of the others!!! This app gives you more options, features, choices, and everything in between! I'm a heavy sleeper and most apps never wake me, but with the optional math equations in Alarm Clock Extreme it never fails to wake me! Don't waste your money on other paid alarm clock apps, or your time on other free ones. I did both and it was exactly that, a big waste.<br />G-Alarm is probably the next best option, but it comes in a VERY distant second place. In fact, I bought G-Alarm for Windows Mobile and it was my goto alarm clock in 06-09, back before Android was released. Years after Android came out, and me staying in contact with the app's developer, a G-Alarm version for Android was finally available. Now though, G-Alarm simply lacks in all the things I used to liked about it. I guess my wants &amp; needs changed that much over the years, but Alarm Clock Extreme handles all of those wants/needs and is the ONLY alarm clock app I'll trust!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|been using the paid version for months, have only overslept due to my own errors setting the wrong times. unpaid is a bit annoying, as you sometimes open a browser clicking on an ad instead of snooze. paid version is worth it, and always good to support good devs.
B004ZQRJFO|3.0|The album has been rumored for so long, I had to put it on \\"Detox\\" status. Back in 1999, Eminem and Royce Da 5'9 linked up on the song \\"Bad Meets Evil\\" on Em's debut album \\"The Slim Shady LP\\". Both artists were at their lyrical best trading bars back and forth. To this day Royce is the only rapper to go bar for bar with Slim Shady. The hype was tremendous when these two were rumored to be making a full length album. But then beef between D-12 and Royce ended all hope of this ever happening. Now Eminem and Royce have finally come together to form the group Bad Meets Evil and their long awaited album \\"Hell: The Sequel\\"<br /><br />The opening track \\"Welcome 2 Hell\\", lets you know that these two are out to prove they have not went soft. This song includes a line by Slim Shady where he links the David Carradine's death and Die Hard (It will make sense once you hear it) The first released single \\"Fast Lane\\" is kind of weak with a fake Nate Dogg singing the hook. \\"I'm On Everything\\" is laughable. It uses a Mike Epps loop for the chorus that isn't funny.  And the beat is very basic. I know Eminem signed Slaughterhouse, but he didn't need them on the song \\"Loud Noises\\". I would have liked that song better without that annoyng hook. \\"Above The Law\\", is a rapid paced song designed to get you hype. Royce is at his best on \\"A Kiss\\". A lot of people trash the second single \\"Lighters\\". I don't think its bad but it should not have been on a Bad Meets Evil album. The gem of the album would have to be \\"The Reunion\\". The beat is the hardest on the album while each rapper tells a story that all connects in the end.<br /><br />A lot has changed in the past 12 years since these two last paired and it shows. I would have rated this album higher if it came out ten years ago. Instead we get a watered down Slim Shady and a past his prime Royce Da 5'9. The chemistry is still there but Royce has some trouble going line for line with Em. Some songs he keeps the pace but others he gets left behind. Overall,this album is solid but I will be surprised if there is ever another Bad Meets Evil album.his album is solid but I will be surprised if there is ever another Bad Meets Evil album.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Best alarm clock in the market. Has not failed me in months of use. Ignore the bad reviews they are just spam.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|Don't get your hopes all up unless you're a Call of duty \ Bad Company 2 rusher king looking for a game of conquest. There is a couple curious scenes about who the aliens are, but to my surprise, they are just foot soldiers looking for action.  The technology they possessed total contradicted them to be fighting at all, and they acted much like someone being controlled in a video game, and not all that impressive. There is a snoozer scene about half way to the middle so be prepared to bring a nite-nite pillow.    The sound effects is what people are referring to as a 5 star movie.    That is 10+.    But as far as a storyline goes, they failed misserably in that dept.  The best thing about this movie is how they took the time to care for civillians!!!! I kept saying \\"come on\\"-  these poor civilans\\" are going to slow you down so cut them loose because the Alien dudes were bringing up the bossman unreal tournament gadgets.    What they need to do is make a saucer movie of us fighting the greys, complete with hyperspace and everything. That I'm still waiting for.  Maybe Hollywood thinks you have to blast it all up like a bunch of monkey's would do to sell the tickets.    I gave it 3 stars because I've had no urges to see it twice.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This isn&apos;t the same alarm. Last time it was gentle alarm by mobitobi. In essence, they are similar to one another.
B004E547D8|5.0|Some of the funninest action comedy I have ever seen.  That old lady who was retired mi6 was pure genius, and   nobody would ever think of her as deadly. What about that character chasing Willis all over the block????   The hand to hand combat was something I'd never expectin his own office - and I laughed so hard I almost had a stroke. :P.  Freeman's only funny scene was at the retirement home with the silencer move. They did not use him that good.  But he was still funny!  Malchovich was a riot.  He never disappoints.  I thought the crazy bunker camoflauge scene thing was just awesome!!  I hope they drop the prices this I'm sure to buy. I'll wait for $9.99.
0307272702|5.0|I had heard about the author and the previous book and ordered this one. It is meticulous, and convincing, and I have changed my eating habits because of this book. I have lost 15 pounds as well as any carb cravings. I feel more alert and have more energy, my skin looks better, and I feel much better.    The author, through researching previous medical studies related to diet, obesity, exercise, and calorie counting, maintains that reducing carb intake to a very low level is the healthiest way to eat.  He presents a strong argument and it is working for me.    I highly recommend this book!
1577311523|5.0|awesome book.  took an extra couple days to reach me, but for the price glad it made it at all & in excellent condition.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I really appreciate the differences between this and the general alarm app on droid - being able to access other ringtones and being able to change the volume.  Maybe you can do it on the other app, but I got this up and running more easily.  Also, who doesn&apos;t love an alarm that has the option to make you solve math in order to snooze? Chutzpah!
B002ZG99N6|3.0|This was a watchable, workmanlike movie. Some interesting acting & a few novel twists but the movie wants us to root for a guy who kills people quite easily & lies to their kidnap victim to make sure his buddy doesn;t need to kill her too -- & then.........falls in love with her?? What did he think was gonna happen?? I guess I'm an old fashioned girl but I'd like to root for somebody a little less violent no matter what his upbringing was like -- and after he tells his true love that he wants to change.....he actually kills even more people than he had before his revelation. Yikes. I gave it 3 stars because hey.........the guys are mostly good looking (and do bank robbers have the time to be so buff?!?!)the film moves at a good pace, and some of the acting is spot on.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game was so cute! I loved it, it was worth the money. The levels got progressively harder so out didn&apos;t get boring.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|OK. Perfect movie? Not. But every time this comes on the channel I watch it. The more I watch it, the better it gets. The plot is a cliche to some degree but the acting is superb for a \\"Grade B horror flick\\" & at the end you can even believe that the detective means what he says to the perp. Making the only religious guy in the movie a Latino is maybe a bit of a sterotype and yet that works too because you believe that HE believes. It's the right mix of morality play and tense who-dun-it. And yeah, you won;t want to ride in an elevator for awhile after seeing this movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i was told this book was amazing ad it truly is its summer so i usally dont read but i stay up late just to read this book and the rest of the trilogy i would recomed thus book and in my opinion is the best book in the world
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin struggled throughout her school years because of her autism. She was viewed by her classmates and teachers as being \\"different\\" and her behavior was often intolerable to them. With the support of a mother and an aunt who cared deeply for her, this brave and brilliant woman was able to overcome the obstacles of autism and eventually earn a PhD in animal husbandry.<br /><br />I recommend that those who plan to view this DVD come prepared with a box of tissues. As Temple overcame each roadblock that was thrown in her path by well-meaning but misguided people who should have been helping her, it was difficult to avoid cries of joy for her accomplishments.<br /><br />Claire Danes is outstanding in her portrayal of Temple Grandin. As Dr. Grandin herself acknowledges in one of the special features of the DVD, she thought she was actually seeing herself as she watched the Emmy-winning presentation of this rendering of her life.<br /><br />Dr. Grandin writes a regular column, \\"The Way I See It,\\" for the Autism Asperger's Digest Magazine. She has published a collection of these columns in a recently updated book by the same title (\\"The Way I See It, Revised and Expanded 2nd Edition: A Personal Look at Autism and Asperger's\\" March 15, 2011). All of the current (as of August 5, 2011) customer reviews of this book give it 5-star ratings.<br /><br />I cannot overemphasize the importance of this movie for anyone who is interested in understanding the life of a person with autism. Current estimates of the frequency of autism is about six children per 1,000. This represents a ten-fold increase over a ten-year period. These statistics highlight the importance of this excellent dramatization of Dr. Grandin's life.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|so many ways to dismiss; shake. math. and. more.  waking up to my music is great. and its free so  why not
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this simply put is the best alarm ever, i used the free version for a few months and recently paid for upgrade a few weeks ago to support dev
B004VMVTNU|1.0|Looks like amazon pissed off enough dev,  so now they have to repeat apps and they have to make a million fake reviews with 5 stars. Free doesn&apos;t mean you screw the Android development community.  \n\nAlso this program is crap,  gentle alarm dose it better.  been using that for months now and never missed getting up,  but then again i have 3 different alarm programs on 2 different devices.  To make me think which one is going off.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|But to be really noticed, you have to do something significantly better. The launching of an app is a start but for practical purposes very limited. Instead, launching of a shortcut would allow us to view a video file or YouTube clip. Also the thing I hate most about alarm clocks is the UI for setting time.  You addressed it in the timer but not the clock. Do these two things and you will stand above the rest.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Dragon Bound was a pure unadulterated pleasure to read.     Dragos won my heart from the beginning; it took Pia a little while but after that, I loved her.   I wasn't interested in the plot for the first half of the book, but after I literally went past the 50% mark, i enjkoyed the book immensely.     Ms. Harrison's writing style is excellent and all things fun.     This is one gem of a book. This book is gold.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Used the free version of this app since I got my phone. It&apos;s an awesome, easy to use alarm app. The multiple settings are nice and very easy to set up. Hands down the best alarm app for android. Just get it!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This documentary series is the best I've seen about WWII - It encompasses every aspect: The German history leading up to the war, battles in Europe, Russia, Pacific, and United states. It also has great first hand interviews of military members, POWs, and civilians. This series is wonderful for people already familiar with WWII or someone wanting to learn about it for the first time.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Never say never....its a free app on amazon for the day lol! Great alarm would recommend to the snoozers out there.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book thinking that it would be something i would read to my neices and nephews. and through the set up of Jacob's history with his grandfather, I thought it would be good to share with a young kid because of the fantastical nature of the kids being described.    Then as Jacob is sent on his own, he sounds more like a typical angry 16 year old. I'm not a prude, but once there was cursing, I realized I wasn't going to re-read this for any younger children.     The story itself was very interesting. I'm by nature a slow reader. I was finished with this in 3 days.     It is set up to have a potential sequeal in the manner of a harry potter book. If that were to happen, I'd definitely pick up the second book.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using the free version for months, and this alarm is the best. I have tried all the other alarms, and they were okay. I like the GPS option, because you have to be up and moving for the alarm to turn off.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game is pretty much the same Angry Birds experience that you can get in any of the other various incarnations.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't warrant anything above three stars.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|its good except that I can just hit the home key and task manage it closed. now hopefully I won&apos;t do it unconsciously in the morning.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Good app that I have owned for a long time. It its fairly easy to use and has sufficient functionality. I especially like the gradually increasing alarm volume. I might give it 5 stars but how excited can you get about an alarm clock?
0553801473|1.0|Very disappointing book.  It had some cool moments, but overall it is still really bad.  Especially considering the huge amount time it took for Martin to finish it.  The characters just wander aimlessly and pointlessly.  He has broken down some of the coolest characters and made them borderline unlikable or useless.  There is so much filler information that I literally skimmed past a large part of the book.  Sloppy writing and abysmal editing make this easily one of the more disappointing books I have read.  Won't buy the next in the series.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|i have been waiting for this app to be free and this morning it did. I'm always late because i hit the snooze button. But this alarm rocks. The math question, especially on hardest, will certainly wake up albeit in a bad mood because the stupid alarm wouldn't stop, but it does the job, with your favorite song.<br /><br />oh since its an app its always running in the background so far i haven't seen any difference in the battery life but you never know.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|As a HUGE Jon Anderson fan who always liked but didn't love Drama, I anticipated this release, but I was afraid I was anticipating a train wreck. I was wrong.    Fly From Here won't stand out as one Yes' greatest recordings, but it is quite good. Benoit David has a strong voice that sounds more like Trevor Horne than Jon Anderson, but it's more elegant than Horne.    The songs themselves are lyrically interesting with suitable instrumental accompaniments. There is little of the dueling between instruments that hurts some past Yes recordings such as the Keys studio tracks. It's the most cohesive band performance since 90125 but has more progressive elements.    Yes needed new blood and new direction and they got it with Benoit David and by turning back to the past with Trevor Horne and Jeff Downes. Way to go guys on a nice album.    One more note. The word \\"love\\" tended to pop up all over the place on every Yes recording starting with Big Generator. It's like the word \\"love\\" was used whenever another word couldn't be thought of. Thankfully, the word \\"love\\" appears exactly 0 times on this CD.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I am recovering from surgery and need to get up and walk every 25 minutes. The timer feature on this app is perfect for reminding my to do that when I am at work. It lets me conrtrol the volume (or vibrate) independently of the phone settings, so I can hear it without disturbing anyone. i don&apos;t think it has multiple timers, but it looks like you can have multiple alarms.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a faithful port of the PC version, and it works great on my Galaxy S.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B00005UW9T|5.0|I remember it was 1997 and I was 5 years old when this movie came out. And I would watch it over and over. This movie tells the story of a russian grandduchess named Anastasia and what could have happened to her. Was she killed or could she have survived. Her grandmother offers a reward of 10 million rubles to anyone who can find Anastasia and have her come back to her. Dimitri and Vlad are scheming to have auditions to have an Anastasia look a like and they unexpectedly find the real Anastasia knowing it was really her til the middle/end. And Dimitri and Anastasia fall in love. But Rasputin is using his evil powers to try and kill her to complete his curse that he put on the family years ago. But can the good guys stop him? My favorite part was when Anastasia and the grandmother were reunited and that Anastasia and Dimitri were together and they promised to visit grandmother and sophie in the future. The movie has a great soundtrack to it and great songs. I sing a long to them all the time. Its hard to pick favorite songs to it because they're all awesome and I love them all. But I love Journey to the Past, the movie version and the version sung by Aaliyah (God rest her soul) Learn to Do It and Once Upon a December and I love In THe Dark of the Night by the guy who played Rasputin. I wish there was a prequel and a sequel to this movie. The prequel would be what Anastasias life was like before all the bad stuff happened. And the sequel could have Anastasia and Dimitri getting married in Paris and they bring everyone including grandmother Sophie and Vlad. And Rasputin could come back from the dead seeking revenge. Some people complain about this film not being historically accurate. They are right but they need to understand that this film is a family film and you don't want violence and gore in it because thats what really happened and you don't want children seeing that.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  A history lesson, love story, and top it off with faye, vamps, witches, and every other paranormal entity you can think of!  No spoilers here just suffice it to say that I hope there is more to follow.
B0050BEM1M|5.0|If you love character films, \\"Another Year\\" is the film for you. Granted, even for a British film, it seemed rather slow for most of the first half but I couldn't stop watching---the characters lured me immediately and persistently.     Lesley Manville plays Mary: a very pretty and exceedingly lonely woman who tries painfully hard to create a life for herself. The depths of her despair but valiant effort to be happy is paralleled by her best friend Gerri, played perfectly by Ruth Sheen. Gerri and Mary have worked together for twenty years. Gerri has always initiated kind and regular invitations to Mary to come to dinner.     Gerri and Tom (played by the brilliant Jim Broadbent) have a mature and loving ease to their marriage of so many years. They are solid realists. Their compassion for their friends and family is equal, their acceptance for a broad range of people in their lives is not only notable but admirable. They have a great heart each and melded together as a couple. Mary has had a tough time of it and it is apparent to the audience that she needs Gerri.     As she and Tom have always invited Mary to dinner for twenty years, Mary has also watched their son grow up---who is now thirty and still single. Mary has a gift for \\"getting ideas\\" about things that are not always true. She's a bit naive and therefore foolish---yet generally harmlessly so. Until one night....     Mike Leigh (writer/director) carefully develops---no, allows his characters to evolve---through ordinary, daily living that as each character's desires come more into focus, they also come into conflict with the desires of others. This drives the story to bring these relationships to a troubling climactic point: Mary's loneliness and deluded need to belong is more than awkward when she meets Joe's (played sweetly by Oliver Maltman) serious girlfriend when he surprises his parents by bringing her to dinner one night. While everyone \\"understands\\" Mary is quirky, no one foresees how toxic her pain has become. Nor how protective Gerri can be of her family.     Has Mary finally overstepped her bounds? Will Gerri and Tom turn on her afterall? Has she lost her best friend Gerri forever?     Other characters enter the story to fill out these three who are the pivotal characters. The film is tender and haunting. These characters will hold your attention and your heart.     It would seem that popular culture is spinning out of control with hypersensitivity to a frenetic need to be in touch with everyone---fast, furious, superficial hydroplaning relationships. Thank God for Mike Leigh. This film is human, rooted, stable, real in its depiction of how beautiful and calm life can be, and how each of us longs for friends like Gerri and Tom. Some of us even wish we could be them. We still need to slow down, to touch the earth, to touch each other, to linger in the presence of those we love.     It's not a feel-good movie, but it is hopeful and satisfying. The characters are so distinctive and memorable. I hope everyone involved receives the recognition they deserve for this meaningful collaboration.     See the film.

0345444051|5.0|A story of a \\"golden age\\" on Earth brought about by the invasion of a great race of aliens known as the \\"Overlords.\\"  This novel from the early 1950s holds up brilliantly today.  Hardly dated, still depressing, exciting, and exhilarating; it is as poetically written as any \\"literary\\" novel (which it is). The characters are so fully realized that Clarke could have deleted the sci fi elements of the story and he still would have had a great novel. In my opinion this is Arthur C. Clarke's greatest book, and stands as one of the best science fiction novels of its time.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I own a 2006 Corvette.  The car did not come with auxiliary options on the stereo system with navigation so I needed something that could support mp3 music.  The Satechi Sound-Fly AUX has fit the bill perfectly!  I can now play mp3's and WMA recordings through my car stereo.    I have to add that I have been amazed by the responsiveness of the Customer Support.  In both contacts to Satechi Customer Support, I was fortunate to have assistance from \\"Arthur.\\"  My first contact, he helped me properly format my flash-drive so that my music in each of my folders would play properly.  My second contact, he helped me find the best frequency to set my device to that would eliminate background distraction.

B0055IU3VS|5.0|Some strange dude in a review squabbled on comparing John Hiatts music to Justin Timberlake and Usher.Now either this dude is 12 years old or doesn't know his serious American musicians.In all fairness,can you even entertain Timberlake and Ushers music to the legend that is John Hiatt?Mabye if John Hiatt took his music down a few notches and made music for money this dude would be more than happy.I can also tell you,i've never found any John Hiatt cds in bargain bins,in fact his cds are always heavily priced,this a sign to me that you are purchasing quality music......The new release from John Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hyms finds John at his best.The album kicks off with a great song Damn This Town which rocks along beautifully,some great lead guitar with some lovely slide.I'm not going to review all the songs but what I will say is this.When you buy a John Hiatt album you've got to find time to sit down throw the legs back,break open a bottle or get yourself a Spliff and digest it from start to finish,listen to the lyrics and the beautiful melodies and great musicianship.This is yet another 5 star album from the Legend that is John Hiatt and I wouldn't have it any other way.Now collect any Timberlake or Usher cds from within your area and light a nice roaring fire.John Hiatt Americas best kept secret but not for much longer I reckon.The Musicians Musician.

I started reading it 6 hours ago, and I have now finished it, and I wish I could have made it last a little bit longer.<br /><br />The idea of two Will Grayson's randomly meeting was highly appealing to me, and I honestly thought there would be more to their meeting than the story actually had, but that didn't matter. Because the way Green and Levithan decided to spin it was absolutely fantastic and way better than I had imagined.<br /><br />Again, the authors' knack for so brilliantly conveying a person's psyche is phenomenal. The thoughts, humour, struggle and emotions were very well displayed across all the characters, and they make each and every character so unique in their own way, that there is noway you wouldn't remember one of them. They are the kind of characters that stay with you long after the story's ended.<br /><br />I read this book and I thought, they'd be crazy not to make an actual production out of it! It has all the elements to keep you reading until the very end - It is sarcastic, bitter, angry, emotional, hilarious, witty, sad, cute, and extremely clever - but what do you expect when you bring two genius writers such as John Green and David Levithan for a collaborative effort?<br /><br />I loved the way they chose to showcase the contrast between the two Will Grayson's in such subtle mannerisms, where in one chapter Will is ranting about the stupid use of \\"lol\\", and then in the next chapter, the other Will uses \\"lol\\" in a conversation with Jane on Facebook. In another chapter Will is forced to sit through Austen's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" with his mother, while the next chapter shows the other Will willingly - no pun intended - owning a copy of Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" in his bookshelf, and the way it's done is so cleverly interwoven in the text that its hilarious and perfect all at the same time.<br /><br />Also, the scene when Will finds out the truth about Isaac was heartbreaking for me, it was a beautifully written scene by Levithan, and he was definitely able to bring out the emotions that Will was feeling at that moment so profoundly. I think there were very important and serious underlying - or maybe not so much underlying - issues throughout the overall plot of the story that allows it to have a stronger impact on you as a reader. Every person reading this story is bound to connect to one of the characters, ideas, thoughts, feelings etc. filling up the pages of this book. And I was no different.<br /><br />The last scene was epic, and Tiny Cooper:<br /><br />My name is not Will Grayson, but I definitely appreciate you.uasion\\" in his bookshelf, and the way it's done is so cleverly interwoven in the text that its hilarious and perfect all at the same time.

0142419400|5.0|And I definitely heart this book! What a CUTE book.<br /><br />From the very beginning, Stephanie Perkins catches your attention and then holds it for the remainder of the book. I started this book only 4 hours ago, and I could not put it down until I reached the very end. And what a sweet sweet ending it was.<br /><br />Anna is such a great character, she's very well rounded, and develops brilliantly throughout the book. Watching her progress through the chapters was so endearing, and makes you root for her the whole way through. Etienne is incredibly sexy in how he is portrayed, and no one could blame Anna for falling for him and being so irresistibly attracted to him from the beginning. It was amazing watching their growing attraction to each other, but also very irritating at parts.<br /><br />The secondary characters were also great, Perkins was able to tap into different types of teen psyches so well that it makes you feel for each and every one of them. And she wrote this book in such a way, that it makes it very easy for you to imagine it being made into a feature film, and a good one with a good plot at that.<br /><br />I loved the Paris descriptions. The language, the little ins and outs of the city, all the things that make Paris so wonderfully French! It made me want to be there, to go there, to study there, to live there. My absolutely most favourite part of the book was how enchanted Anna was with Notre-Dame. The reason I loved it so much was because I remembered when I first saw the cathedral myself and how breathtaking it was to see it up close and personal, and how absolutely taken by it I was. It was the most beautiful thing ever, and the most beautiful setting to Victor Hugo's story, and seeing it live is such a great experience. Reading about it, and having Perkins put it into words like that was great, because she was able to catch its magic perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, this was an amazing book, a story told so brilliantly about a girl who was forced into independency and leaving her parents home a little too early. But one that managed to beat the odds and fought her way through and came out the winner at the end.<br /><br />I'd definitely see myself reading this again in the future, but I also know that I can't wait for Perkins next novel coming out in September.her parents home a little too early.

B004GYY714|5.0|I like Pandora a lot but dislike that you are forced to listen to the songs they pick out. with this app if you don&apos;t like the song you are listening to you can just go to another station &amp; listen to some good music from your favorite radio station...Luv it!!
0375842209|5.0|What an incredibly amazing book. I don't know what words to use to try and convey how deeply poignant and outstanding this book was. But I know, that if Liesel were here, she'd know the exact words to use to describe this book to you, the same way she was able to describe every book she read throughout this story.<br /><br />To tell the story of WW2, the Holocaust, and Nazi Germany from the perspective of Death is the most unique and creative twist I've experienced in years. But to tell it from the perspective of Death AND a little girl who witnessed the death of her little brother, went to live with a foster family and learned to read, and write by stealing her first book was an even greater experience.<br /><br />In short, this is a novel narrated by Death - and who knew that Death had a sarcastic and unique sense of humour? Death tells us the story of the lives and deaths of all the people who played a part in Liesel's life. He does it awkwardly, and yet that only adds to the unusual style of writing and fits the story perfectly, as it shows a more \\"real\\" side of Death, and makes us feel so profoundly with Liesel.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, as this is a book worth reading, but I will say this, books, her Papa Hans, her Mama Rosa whose favourite word of endearment was \\"Saumensch\\", the lemon haired Rudy and feather haired Max, a Jew hiding in a basement, were some of the few things that Liesel fell in love with during her lifetime. And what a roller coaster of a lifetime it was.<br /><br />This book brought me to tears, and it left my chest feeling heavy. It is definitely a book that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.<br /><br />Well done, Zusak.

0452286751|4.0|When I started reading The Fountainhead it took me a year to complete the novel, but it was definitely worth the read.<br /><br />Fountainhead revolves around five main characters: Howard Roark, Peter Keating, Dominique Francon, Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand. The story goes on to talk about Howard Roark's blatant rebellion to society's traditions, especially in the field of architecture. He would not submit to the `classical' and traditional style of building, but rather followed his own mind and his own personal vision of how buildings should look like. To him, modern architecture was a way of expressing himself, as he is a very silent and closed person, but he spoke through his drawings and his creations. Through his journey, we meet all those people mentioned above, as each affected his life to a certain degree and he had to fight through it all as a singular force that took a stand against the architectural establishment of his day. And in his own unique way, he prevailed.<br /><br />One of the main and more obvious themes that the book discusses was the conflict between traditional architecture and modern architecture. In those days, the common and dominant style of architecture was the classical style; skyscrapers were not accepted, as were all modern architecture. Of course, as expected, societies follow the norm, and the norm was classic, not modern. Therefore, traditional architects were respected and highly looked upon, whereas modern architects lived in shabby states and were neither respected nor were they counted as architects in the first place. Howard Roark worked to prove society wrong and defied them by building one skyscraper after the other, forcing modern architecture on them. Rand uses architecture as the all-encompassing metaphor of the novel to showcase her argument for \\"selfishness\\". Otherwise, the story is pretty much standard soap opera. The book is best when its simply talking in terms of monologues. It definitely brings up an interesting argument. Roark's - or let's say Rand's - architectural views represent his/her philosophy of life, just as buildings designed by men like Peter Keating and other more traditional architects, represented their philosophies.<br /><br />This was a very interesting book, and the classic vs. modern theme was only one of MANY themes in this book; including selfishness, altruism, power, collectivism vs. individualism, integrity, morality and much more. If people haven't read it yet, please do so, even if you hate it, it's still worth the read I think.rk's - or let's say Rand's - architectural views represent his/her philosophy of life, just as buildings designed by men like Peter Keating and other more traditional architects, represented their philosophies.

014241493X|5.0|I started reading Paper Towns yesterday, and finished it just a couple of hours ago, and that was only because work got in the way! Otherwise, I would literally not have put it down.<br /><br />It was hilarious, it was engaging, it was endearing, it was clever, it was sarcastic and it was very very witty. All things that I love, making it a perfect, well-rounded book.<br /><br />John Green can clearly tap into a teenager's psyche like no other. His ability to convey a teenager's thoughts, humour, struggle and emotions were incredible. And I fell in love with each and every character in the book who were also very well-rounded. Quentin's circle of friends were some of the most charming and captivating characters, I could almost feel them jumping out of the book and coming to life, they were THAT real.<br /><br />Quentin is a timid, and dorky teenager, but he is also loyal, devoted, considerate and sincerely sweet, and he's had a crush on his next-door neighbour for as long as he can remember. Only he always thought he was completely invisible to her...until she climbs through his bedroom window dressed like a ninja asking him to accompany her on a life-changing journey.<br /><br />Margo's a spontaneous, wild, independent and carefree girl who was always known for breaking the rules and norms - all things that appealed to Quentin. So when she disappeared, no one was bothered about it, including her parents, who were used to (and fed up with) her random disappearances and antics. Only there was more to Margo than meets the eye, and Quentin was about to find out all about it. But it doesn't stop there, because Margo was also about to discover that there is more to Quentin than meets the eye, surprising both him and herself (and his entire circle of friends.)<br /><br />Q's best friends, Radar and Ben, are absolutely amazing, and very very memorable characters that will stay with you even after you've finished reading the book. Each one of them had their own little quirks and whims and eccentricities that made them stand out in their own way - even Lacey. The dialogue between all three of them is hysterical and witty, it makes you literally laugh out loud. (I had to muffle my own laughter several times at the office!) But Green was also able to take serious situations and convey them through those boys in a remarkable fashion. There were moments when the dialogue would turn poignant, broody, and contemplative, and the message behind the journey was one of a serious note as well.<br /><br />\\"People are rarely the way you imagine them to be.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, Paper Towns is an incredible page-turner that will keep you wanting more.

This poor child is not only subjected to horrifyng sexual assaults, sometimes almost daily, but bears this monster two children, giving birth the first time when she was just fourteen. For years her abductor, who was known to the police although they did nothing about it, and his wife, his enabler, kept the girl hidden for eighteen years in a backyard prison.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a well designed and easy to use alarm that can actually get just about anyone out of bed in the morning. \n\nThe GPS permission may seem odd, until you read what the app uses it for.\n\nJust picture it - you&apos;re driving (or biking) in rush hour traffic to get to an early meeting and your alarm goes off and you have to solve three math problems to dismiss it. Annoying at best, maybe dangerous if you take your eye off the road to shut it up.  If you enable the GPS monitoring option, the alarm won&apos;t go off if it senses that you&apos;re in motion. Problem solved!\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned the previously offered free app of the day &apos;Gentle Alarm&apos; is a similar product and might be a better fit for some.  Both apps have free trial versions, I highly recommend giving them both a try to see which you prefer, and then purchasing the full version of your choice. Both are amazingly superior to the native alarm app and you&apos;ll be glad you spent less then you would on one Starbucks coffee to get yourself going on time every morning!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Every morning I wake  up(not to this or any alarm), roll over and grab my galaxy tab.  I unplug it (did you know you can&apos;t use it while its charging? Piece of crap but that&apos;s a whole different  issue), push the awake button, and go straight  to Amazon&apos;s app store. Of course  I want to check out the free app but, and this is almost better, I want to read the reviews.  It has been very entertaining and provided  me with lots of &quot;hey, you won&apos;t believe what I read this morning&quot; moments.  My personal  favs are the reviewers who decide that other reviews are either fake or from the developer.  If the author of the review has good grammar, a vocabulary  that includes more words than &quot;this suks&quot; and can write a sentence containing  more than  three words, then,according  to some, it must be fake?  I love reading all the back and forth  debate!! I think the reviewers who bash others for being stupid (app not trying to steal your brain if the alarm needs gps or access  to phone calls) are very funny.  I go back to work in 1 week, 4 days, but I might have to use this great alarm app (bet you thought I was going to forget to actually  review  app, lol) to wake up 20 mins earlier.  I&apos;m a history teacher so having to do math problems  will definitely  work to wake me up (what a creative idea!!).\nHave a fab day everyone!!!!!  \n

Not going to lie, I have done that a time or two! \n\nI have been using this alarm for at least a year, so I think it is well worth the price, and even better if you can get it for free!
0307405095|5.0|What makes this a great and useful tool to create great tarts and pies is in this reviewer's opinion is two-fold: great creative chapter organization, and each recipe has a wonderful four-color photo.  Add to this great written instructions, sources/resources section and The Basics, i.e. crust, etc. it makes it one of the best pie and tart cookbook collections around.<br /><br />Thus far tried but a few, but they are just terrific: Peach and Creme Fraiche Pie; Rainbow Puff-Pastry Tarts; and Banana and Coconut Cashew-Cream Tart.<br /><br />If you like me love tarts and pies rather than cake or other desserts, this is great one for you!

B000002J0B|5.0|I have been listening to Zeppelin albums over and over, for more than 40 years now.  That doesn't mean I don't listen to other things.  It also doesn't mean that I'm some kind of Zeppelin authority.  But I know what I like.  And for my money, this is Led Zeppelin's best album.  Oh sure---they had bigger hits.  More successful albums.  More dramatic releases, that contain concert standard after concert standard.  Albums where Bonham may have an absolute showcase, Jimmy wails on the axe a little more and Robert has a song or two where he screams the blues a little better.  But you need to understand something.  From the standpoint of musicianship and the musical maturity of a band, this is far and away Zeppelin's best.  When I listen to each and every song on \\"Houses of The Holy\\" I continue to be absolutely amazed by the perfection of each and every instrument, each and every vocal, each and every note, on each and every song.  This may just be a perfect album.  It is, and always will be, my favorite from them.    The band never played better than they played on \\"Houses of the Holy\\"

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is one of the best workout videos I have ever done.  It's right up there with the low-impact Callanetics video (a great workout with entertaining 80's music and outfits).  It WILL kick your ass.  It will change your body and increase your endurance if you stick with it.  Best part is it's under 30 minutes a day.      The movements are basic ones that you have probably done before, so no need to keep up with complicated maneuvers.  Even so, this is a difficult workout.     I should note, like many other reviewers here, that it can put stress on your knees; but, with proper technique and maybe some modified moves you will be fine.  Just listen to your body!  There is a difference between fatigue and stress.      For me, I noticed a difference in my body within the first week.  My endurance absolutely improved, and my body became more elongated and toned.  I did not measure myself so I don't know how many inches I lost, but my clothes definitely fit better!      I noticed some of the other reviewers have commented that they have not lost any weight doing this workout.  I just want to say to keep in mind that unless you have a whole lot of weight to lose, you may not see a huge difference on the scale.  You will build a lot of muscle doing this workout, and muscle weighs more than fat does.  Ditch the scale and get out the tape measure if this is the case for you as it was for me.    Other useful notes:  I find Jillian to be very tolerable in this video.  She is encouraging and states the facts, but she is not bullying or overly annoying like she can sometimes be on tv.  The workout is go-go-go, with no water breaks or opportunities to catch your breath.  Stick with it because after a few workouts you won't miss those breaks so much.    I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the stress on the knees, the weak ab workout and the warm-up being way too brief.
0743270754|4.0|This is an excellent book by Doris Kearns on the caabinet of Linchon, which included William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. So in the same book, you get parallel moving biographies of all 4 personalities. Dr. Goodwin does an excellent job in this book of describing the story of our sixteenth President and his adversarial peers. Lincoln's honesty and sincerity shines through on each page. His political genius is very apparent and shows why he is our countries greatest President. There is so much to learn in this book-it should be near the top of any one's reading list on U.S. history. A very complex and incredible tale. Highly recommended!

B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is been a great app ever since I downloaded it. I&apos;ve had the free version for over a year now and it is kept me from oversleeping is perfect to have especially when doing math problems in order to have to snooze or dismiss the alarm.
0800141601|5.0|This was an awesome movie . Sometimes it is hard to find a movie you can watch with the family....ths is one you can!
B001974DG0|5.0|This book & author was highly recommended to me by an Aunt who is also a D.K. fan. I was instantly taken in from the first page & when Einstien{pardon any mis-spellings}entered the picture, I fell in love with him, Travis & Nora. The carefully well thought out well written words makes you forget that you're reading a book because Dean Koontz was able to make me feel like I'm the characters. I smiled, laughed, & even cried @ certain parts. Dean Koontz has a wonderful & gifted talent & a unique way with words. \\"Watchers\\" is my #1 favorite D.K. book so far. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who enjoy dogs,action,thrillers,heart racing,suspense,heart warming, with a dash of romance all in one book, then this book is for you. Happy reading.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The product was in perfect condition, as expected from Amazon. I would have preferred the full screen version, if there was one, but could not find it advertised.
B000001FN3|5.0|This is an older CD but is a wonderful act of creativity and musical genius. Alan Parsons uses the stories of Edgar Allen Poe to musically put one into the atmosphere and get the stories completely understood through the talent and use of this musical atmosphere. It has been one of my very favorites sine it's creation and if you want to have a piece of Poe, it is a must.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It is worth $1.49 even more but thanks to Amazon it is free again. I love that it starts out quiet and gets louder. Everything an alarm can do this does and it does it right. I don&apos;t normally waste my time with reviews because most reviewers here are morons but this deserves a good review.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app worked fine for a while, but now will not play or download anything, just loads forever, and downloads disappear.  Useless!
B004VMVTNU|3.0|The best alarm is on Market but not listed on Amazon: Good Morning has ALL the features this has, such as math problems to snooze. You can also use the gentle wake up with a fade in. But what I love is that I can type in text and it will be read aloud. For example, You have to be in an hour early today. Nothing like nagging yourself while in a deep sleep. :)\n\nAlso, I can have the alarm read out loud calendar entries and give me the weather aloud.\n\nI have NO relationship with the other app or its developer. It&apos;s just a truly great alarm.

B004VMVTNU|3.0|Only dl&apos;d this to have a look and compare it to gentle alarm. Gentle alarm looks better and has better options in my opinion. Check it out.

0553801473|4.0|If you are a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, don't cheat yourself - pick this book up.  Is it the most exciting volume in the series?  I don't believe so.  Is it an excellent piece of fiction?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Martin's writing maintains its beautiful imagery and graceful flow.  The dialogue is excellent as always and his character-building remains unsurpassed.  These qualities lend ammunition to his critics, however.  In order to build a deep, rich world, with characters that seem real and stir your emotions, Martin must spend time exploring subplots, private thoughts and reflections.  There's just no way around it, IMO.  Personally, I don't think there should be.<br /><br />This volume is not the battle-filled action volume of a Storm of Swords.  It's much more contemplative and thought-evoking.  That doesn't mean it's worse - just different.  It does advance the plot but not incredibly so.  It's unrealistic to expect that this book ever would when Martin has been clear, time and time again, that this book runs tandem with AFFC.<br /><br />I think the biggest spark that has led to so much disdain for this volume is the fact that Martin - SPOILER ALERT - is willing to kill off major characters.  Anyone who seriously holds this against this book is a fool.  Martin has shown, since AGOT, that he is more than willing to kill off major characters.  This has set him apart from his peers.  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?  That's irrelevant at this point.  If you don't like it, then you should have stopped reading by ASOS.<br /><br />Book reviews, ultimately, should weigh most heavily whether the author has succeeded in maintaining the reader's attention and investment of time.  Martin has done so.  I still remain in awe of his writing talent and feel genuine happiness and sadness for his fictional characters.  That's the mark of GREAT writing.
0062060554|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  When it dragged I figured it had to - day after day of an amnesics life equals a lot of repetition - but it would all be worth it for the shocking and thrilling ending right?.  Nope, lots of buildup and it fizzled out - like a dud of a firework.
0767903862|3.0|A Bryson classic, full of information and a treasure trove of interesting stuff to learn. once again, my hat goes off to his investigative acumen. but, and that's a big BUT, he finished the book without interviewing a single Aborigine. OK, he mentioned their plight, their second-class, \\"invisible\\" status in the Australian society, but why he wouldn't talk or even try to talk with at least one of them is beyond me. he could have spent much less time in those long, lonely, endless drives in the middle of nowhere and bring some perspective into the whole thing. and to finish it off, i don't know how he signed off without giving a few pages to boomerangs and kangoroos.
B004UVCOZ4|4.0|This set is a fantastic value - you really do get 20 early Miles Davis albums for a little more than a dollar each.  I was only missing 11 of them from my collection, and it was still worth buying this set in order to get them for less than $2 each.    A few things to be aware of:    1) The album 1958 Miles is missing the live cuts from the Plaza.  It does have the bonus track \\"Little Melonae\\".    2) The album Porgy And Bess is not complete in this set.  I'd say that about 80% of the songs are present.  This is hinted at in Amazon's album description but not fully described.    3) Most of the albums are bare-bones; i.e. no alternate cuts that you might find on the proper CDs.    That aside, this is an amazing way to jump-start or fill in your Miles Davis collection for $1 - $2 per album.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie is an outstanding view of the holocaust from the inside.  It is a way off witnessing how humans can condition themselves into behaving poorly towards other humans and how a persecuted group reacts then survives.  Ben Kingsley leads the great performances in the film.  Amazon delivered this great film within a few days of my ordering.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I use In Treatment,Season One and Two as tools to deepen my insight into the therapeutic process. I have been a therapist for 12 years, and still I have learned from repeated viewings of these sessions. I can turn off the sound and focus on the visual patterns of non-verbal language between client and therapist, or watch one client's sessions back-to-back through the entire series, watching for client changes as the therapy progresses. At times the therapist makes mistakes, a clear statement by the creators that therapists are human, too. It's fascinating to see the therapist work with his own therapist and face his own personal demons, even as he's called on to step into his therapeutic self on behalf of clients. I have used segments of this series for training interns. I've shown some at staff meetings. Currently I am meeting with others one evening every other week to digest a week's worth of sessions. I do understand that these sessions were written for dramatic effect, but they are not too far from my experiences. I forgive the high drama because I get so much from deep analysis of the sessions. We don't often get an opportunity to look inside the sanctuary of the therapy room. I recommend the series for study by serious students of the therapeutic process.
0425242099|5.0|Everything Nalini Singh writes is gold and this is one certainly is. Well developed characters, story that ties together, action, romance, updates on those from previous books and continuing to flesh out and develop the Changeling/Psy world as it evolves.
0553801473|1.0|The Title of the review says it all...<br />The first three books where enjoyable, they moved well and gave the reader some sense of purpose, and closure to specific plots and caricatures. The fourth book was fabrication of a totally new storyline. Sure it had the son of a son of a son who lived on an island or found faith in a stranger face or some other ridiculous by in... All in all a total departure of the story of the other three. Some who died in the other stories somehow... AND TOTALY UNEXPLAINED, somehow come back to life... Seems someone's milking a plot to try to pull twelve or more books out of the deal.<br />The SIX YEARS, SIX YEARS later we are asked to return to the plots of characters we know and love, are spun into tiresome tales of what they are wearing, who they are bedding and what risks they are about to take. Some more die, but thoughts are now on the line of, \\"Oh, are they really dead?\\" and some return that where dead and in two or three sentences are on again about their original quest. I literally skinned through a third of this book as I did the rubbish of the last. Though there are a multitude of chances for adaptation of the current themes they are obliterated without answer, or taken along another useless path that never needed to begin. Some morons call this guy the next R.R. Tolkien? At least He knew how to pull a plot together and when to end a story.<br /> I will not be waiting for any other books of this story or this writer to spend my time nor wages on.  I can't wait that long ant it is'nt worth it.
B0052KJ5TK|5.0|Once again the band has produced another great album. The production is very slick and the band has evolved into a very tight group. The songwriting is getting better if that's possible. The deluxe version is great value with a few bonus tracks. Really annoyed that we don't have any radio coverage here in Australia of great bands such as this.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I don't understand all the negative reviews here AT ALL (haters? trolls? what?).. I'll be the first to admit this album takes more than one listen to fully appreciate, so I beg of you, listen to it in full more than once. It's Gaga's best work yet. Don't expect it to be like The Fame (which is a good pop album, but has fillers, so I don't get why it's as praised as it is by some people) or The Fame Monster (which is amazing, no fillers, but she's grown since then). She's coming into her own with this album, and I love it. There's so many different sounds.. and I love the guitar/sax solos. You can totally hear the influences from Queen, Bruce Springsteen, etc, and yes, Madonna. Not in a bad way, though.. she puts her own spin on it. Every artist is influenced by someone! And this generation deserves someone like Gaga who will hopefully go on to become an icon of their caliber. Standout tracks in my opinion are: Heavy Metal Lover, Marry The Night, The Edge of Glory, Judas, and Hair.. but I love the entire album, which is something I can rarely say.    I'm not really great at writing reviews and things, but I wanted to help the ratings for this album out cause in no way, shape, or form, does it deserve less than 4 stars. If you like pop music, and rated it lower than that, I guess you should stick with generic cookie-cutter pop. That's not what this album is.    The only thing I don't really like is she seems to repeat lyrics here and there.. not even lyrics, more like she repeats words. For example, she mentions leather and whiskey more than once. But oh well, it's minor.
B0015AARJI|5.0|There isn't much to add, this is the standard wireless controller for the PS3. I've tried the controllers from the Xbox 360, and I must say that this suits me better, maybe beacause I'm already used to this type of controller for having played PS1, and PS2. Overall is a great controller, but I consider the fair price must always  be &lt;= $35, because once the battery dies you have to replace it.
0439023483|5.0|With the exception of the Harry Potter books, I normally don't like YA fiction, but this one surpasses them all! Unless you have a low gore tolerance or are not a fan of \\"darker\\" books, I honestly can't see how anyone could give this phenomenal series anything below 5 stars.

0981951244|1.0|I did not care for this book at all!<br />The author boasts a lot of his own accomplishments and this comes across as overly self-promoting. My favorite quote in the book,\\" I was eighteen when I was introduced to the idea of personal responsibility at a seminar.\\" What? He drones on and on in the beginning about all the great lessons his dad taught him but he learns this at a seminar at 18? Who goes to a seminar at 18? The book ends with you creating another \\"you-can-do-it!\\" self help list for the five people you will buy this book for... LAME!!!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I recently got the Iphone 4 through Verizon so I was specifically looking for a case that would fit the verizon phone and that was slim yet effective in doing the job of protecting my new investment.  I love this case.  My friend has the same Iphone as I do and she had bought an Otterbox case. It's huge! It may work- I would imagine.. it is so big that how could it not?? But you can't even see her pretty white Iphone at all underneath it.  I definitely wanted something slim and something that would enhance my nice Iphone look.  My white Iphone looks great in this case (you can still tell that it's an iphone), it's slim, and now that my son has managed to drop it from above a shopping cart on to cement.. I have to say it is sturdy. No damage to it at all. The front of the case comes around just enough so that if it falls face down it is still protected. I ordered this case with 2 day delivery and I got it the next day. Overall, the case cost me $20.  In store cases are usually $25 and up and do not have this quality.  I am extremely satisfied. Thank you Amazon!
193413712X|4.0|Just as the title says, in simplicity; Paul Harding is a writer whom we cannot ignore, but the story itself is drab.  Tinkers is the story of an old man in his last week(?) dying of old age and remembering his life and the life of his family. The heart isn't in the plot, rather it is found in the words written. Every word of every sentence of every page is used intentionally and written with great thought and design. Harding is a gifted writer in prose and structure. The ability to make a story that is very readable out of such a simple, and plainly boring, subject awesomely illumines his ability as a writer, but not as a storyteller. Should this have actually won the Nobel prize? No, it shouldn't. Does it deserve to be read and interpreted in high school and college writing classes? Yes!  This book is meant to be read slowly, analyzed while being read, and absorbed as a whole as well as line-by-line. This is one of the very few books I would recommend people to read at least twice to take in all of what it has to offer in its literary elements. A good comparison would be, The Davinci Code is to rock 'n' roll, as Tinkers is to classical music. It's not as entertaining and not blatent in it's specific message, but Tinkers is meant to be more of an intellectual form of art. Although there is zero suspense and no desire to \\"find out what happens next\\", it is mentally draining and emotionally moving in a way that keeps the reader unable to look away. This is more of a display of how great writing and words can be manuevered and manipulated to set a scene and create a story and meaning. It deserves four stars easily and probably 4.5 if that were an option, but the lack of any real story keeps it from being a 5 star novel. Tinkers is a very interpretive novel and you will find different meaning from this novel than any other person who reads it. All-in-all, it's a short novella and definitely worth your time and them some to read, absorb, and reflect on its purpose. It may not fully deserve a Nobel prize, but it would be very hard for me to personally strip it of any rights to it.

1451629184|5.0|This is a very touching story with many divergent aspects, troubling and emotional, but ultimately a tale of survival and strength.  Jaycee is a good writer.  Often she sounds like the eleven year old young girl she was when she was abducted, but the story is anything but childish.  As her journals reveal, she always wanted to be a writer or a veterinarian.  I hope she will continue to write.
1595825045|5.0|The book was all that I expected it to be and more. :)  It's basically designed in the order the series was created in. From initial ideas, including what brought about the idea of Avatar in the first place all the way up to creating the artwork for the game. It's a great book if you're interested in getting idea's from the creators, and all the artists that worked on the series.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|This is not a bad alarm clock app. However I give it 1 Star for the fake reviews from the dev.

B005F2BHGE|3.0|Caught this at a theater nearby and I have to say that I did enjoy this. It wasn't great or even \\"really good\\" but it was better than most of JCVD's other dtv movies(excluding US3 and Replicant)...and better than some of his later theatrical movies(Street Fighter,Double Team,Knock Off, Unisol:The Return). I think putting it on the same level as Wake of Death is pretty fair. I actually may have liked this a little more since it didn't feature the dopey MTV edits that WOD had. The acting was pretty solid all around for the most part. JC's son, Kris' character(Schell) was extremely pointless in my opinion...not to mention he sucked in it. Felt like he was reading his lines the entire movie. I really liked JC and Adkin's chemistry together. They played off each other really well but I was left wanting to see more of them sharing the screen. There were a few aspects I didn't care for but I don't want to spoil anything. Production wise, the movie looks pretty good considering the budget. It's well directed and shot. Good music score too. However, I actually feel like it would have made for a better at home experience than a theatrical one. The sepia tone actually looked a little blurred on the big screen during some of the wide shots...and I did find myself craving a little color. Close ups looked good though. All in all, it was a pretty good movie. This gives me hope for The Butcher. If Ernie Barbarash had a little more money to work with, he'd do a hell of a job. 3.25/5
B005CMSDKA|4.0|Now this is a really good movie. One of the best I've seen this year. It reminded me a lot of the Bourne films, except this time the person laying the beat downs and killing people left and right is a young girl that even Hit-Girl would envy. Basically she is trained to be a lethal assassin by her father, who has a background in the subject, in a remote cabin cut off from the outside world. Let's just say that some covert operation from years back had some loose ends that needed tying up, so of course they are now the targets, but boy did they mess with the wrong duo.<br /><br />I liked the strong European feel from the locations to the small character parts throughout. It was kind of like entering a different world. Throw in some well choreographed fight scenes that don't shy away from the violence despite the PG-13 rating and you've got quite the feast. It's even peppered with a number of light hearted moments that might bring a smile to your face. The directing, camera work, writing and music were also of high caliber, but the strong level of acting on display really stole the show.<br /><br />There are a number of really talented young actresses at the moment (Hailee Steinfeld and Chloë Grace Moretz for example), but Saoirse Ronan is in the same league if not even better. I had previously seen her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and while I had issues with both of those films, she was the definite standout. Her line delivery and facial expressions continue to amaze for someone her age. This is her best role by far. You will believe she is not someone to mess with. Eric Bana is convincing as her father and Cate Blanchett turns in one of her best roles ever in my opinion. What a bad lady. Even the weirdo psycho killer working for Blanchett is memorable in a part that could have been a throwaway.<br /><br />Now for some minor negatives. A couple of parts did get a little slow and once the mystery is revealed it's more of a been there done that kind of deal, but overall Hanna remains a unique blending for an action film. One that actually has the smarts to stretch beyond the genre's normal limitations.<br /><br />And yes, I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but in the end I just couldn't pull the trigger.a unique blending for an action film.

0486237664|5.0|This is it- this is the book you need. It is so commonly used that when an animal from this book appears in a painting or piece of graphic art artists immediately recognize it and chuckle to themselves. I remember a friend used an illustration from this book for the cover of a self-published book, he showed the book to a group of artists and every single artist immediately recognized the image. Pretty much every artist has a tattered copy in their studio, it is the book you need, if you do not have it get it.

I have a tendency to start sleeping through alarms after a month or so,  and this one let&apos;s me change it up when I start doing that.  Several different ways to snooze\/dismiss the alarms,  you can set the snooze to decrease by however many minutes you want each time you hit it,  increase the number of math problems with each snooze,  etc.  Even the soundest &apos;snoozer&apos; tends to wake up when the alarm is going off every minute with 15 math problems to do.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I had not expected this movie to be this good, or for the boys to do such an incredible job acting that they dragged you right in.<br /><br />I served in the military, and spent almost 5 years in Germany, and have gone and visited camps.  And even all the years after the fact, you can still almost feel the horror and despair.  Simply visiting was a horrific experience, because the whole time you are there, you can't help but try to imagine what it was like.  Anyone with the sensitivity of a caterpillar ends up overwhelmed with compassion and loss, numbed and unable to encompass the magnitude of the reality.<br /><br />In all the things I've seen regarding the camps, I've never seen, or even imagined, a story about it portrayed through the eyes of an 8 year old child.  And not just an 8 year old child inside the camp, but an 8 year old child who is outside of it, innocent of what is going on while his father is the German running the camp.  An 8 year old who befriends a Jewish boy interred in the camp his father runs, neither really understanding the full reality.  And watching as the little German boy starts to wonder, to question, to learn that the lies he was fed were just that, lies.<br /><br />Watching the story unfold, drawing you along with it, starting out so innocently, and seeing as the people who were unaware start to become aware...  It was masterfully done.  I have to get the book now.<br /><br />Such a simple premise for a story, but such a powerful one.  It's one of those movies that will be with you for a long time...
B000RF7XYO|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie when I first saw it and knew nothing of Elizabeth or Tudor history. Now that I'm a Tudor history student I'm very disappointed in the film and am only really able to enjoy it because I previously loved it. I know Michael Hirst knows his Tudor history and I'm sad that this film seems to follow the first season of The Tudors on Showtime. Total disregard for historical events and persons. After The Tudors season one was slaughtered with reviews by people who love Tudor history, season two became way more watchable and I'm hoping that Michael Hirst will rewrite Elizabeth I as the next Showtime series. He can do Elizabeth way more honor than this movie and the The Golden Age.    Overall, good movie if you don't know the history. If you do I'd skip this one because you'll pull your hair out.
B0010DRYSM|1.0|The same cover from 2004, but hidden by a new sleeve. Released again in 2008. On the the cover the claim, \\"enhanced for widescreen TVs\\". Shame on you Warner Brothers. You've repackaged the old release which was not (and is not) enhanced for widescreen TVs. Now I have two copies with black bars on all four sides. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... It won't happen again, until the word hits the streets that a Warner Brothers Release is truly anamorphic, I won't buy. Bad business move. Very Bad.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|A lot of younger guys are discovering 1970s music. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenaged sons and their friends are regularly asking me for recommendations of 1970s albums and bands. They all know Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd but, surprisingly, they don't seem to know much about the Stones.<br /><br />To assist some of the younger guys discovering 1970s music, I'll recommend Exile On Main Street is one of the essential albums for your collection. It's one of that decade's best albums.<br /><br />This particular release has some extra tracks that weren't on the original album release. The extra tracks are worth having but they're not essential. This particular edition with the extra tracks is about $13 more than the basic CD edition without the extra tracks. If you can live without the extra tracks, then save yourself some $ and buy the regular edition of this album. But whichever option you choose, buy this album for your 1970s music collection.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're exploring 1970s music, the Stones' Exile On main Street is an essential album for your music collection.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|Before I throw my 0.02 in, I just would like to point out that not only I enjoy 70s Yes, I also really like Rabin's Yes, Yes of the 90s up to Magnification, for 80s and 90s Yes is the music I grew up with. All the classic albums, like CTTE, TFTO and Relayer, were heard by me just after Magnification was released...  However, I NEVER liked what Buggles did to the sound of Yes. The only positive moment I can find on Drama is Machine Messiah... a very interesting start, kind of Black Sabbath gloomy, with very beautiful passages and rhythm changes. Imo, it's the last track where Steve Howe is still majestic and powerful (like CTTE and Relayer majestic if it makes any sense). The rest of the tracks are just... well, boring... I didn't have any trouble with the keyboardist Downes (mind you, I do not think that Wakeman is a key member in the group, even around Tormato he started sounding rather cheesy in certain places). As for the vocalist - Trevor Horn, I found him abysmal... the man is a good producer, his voice is not that bad on \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" but his singing on a Yes record was just a disgrace to me.    Anyway, I was in great dismay and disbelief when I found out about the new album coming up with the Buggles team, some mediocre singer from a tribute band, and with a \\"great suite track\\" based on a crappy second-rate Buggles material which was not good enough even for Drama...    With a heavy heart I started listening to the album... I didn't like it at first at all, but I kept listening to it... Trying to find something of value... and when my disappointment with their ditching Jon went away a bit, I found that some songs on this album are quite good... STILL, they could have been so much better if sung by Anderson... anyway, here we go, track-by-track (this would be my 5th \\"whole-listen-through\\" of the album):    1. \\"Fly from Here - Overture\\" - well, it's an overture indeed, shows all the musical themes to come... a rather nice instrumental.  2. \\"Flyfrom Here - Pt I - We Can Fly\\" - this melody is so 1980 in a bad way (sounds of that time that is, not innovative at all), imho. Benoit starts singing, which is... well, cringe worthy. So, far my worst fears are confirmed: this record is even worse than Drama...   3. \\"Fly from Here - Pt II - Sad Night at the Airfield\\" - it starts out very nice, with this guitar picking technique, used by Lennon in \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Julia\\"... than Benoit start singing, melody starts developing into nowhere... so far very sad (not the music, I mean its quality) and boring.  4. \\"Fly from Here - Pt III - Madman at the Screens\\" - this one is slightly more interesting... the \\"ta-ra-ram\\" drum fill with an echo effect during \\"Sailor, sailor, beware\\" seems to be lifted from \\"White Car\\"    5. \\"Fly from Here - Pt IV - Bumpy Ride\\" - quite stupid... sounds somewhat like that Alan White intro into \\"Changes\\" from 90125, only the melody (is there even any melody?) sounds more stupid and blatant...     6. \\"Fly from Here - Pt V - We Can Fly (Reprise)\\" - repeats the best part of the song. I actually like the chorus on \\"Fly from Here\\", the only thing worthy of attention in this Drama left-over...  phew! This truly \\"epic\\"... boredom and mediocrity seems to be finished.  7. \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\" - finally! Something on this wretched record is improving. Really nice track from Squire, his vocals are rather nice, nice guitar licks from Howe. Reminded me of \\"It Can Happen\\" and \\"eeeyaeeeyay\\" towards the end immediately brought up memories of \\"To Be Alive (Hep Yadda)\\". Insert this new offering from Squire somewhere into \\"The Ladder\\" instead of \\"It'll be a good day\\" or \\"If only you knew\\" and \\"The Ladder\\" would have been a bit stronger album, I assure you. I liked this track after a couple of listens, very cheerful and bright (in a good way, not \\"Teakbois\\" cheerful, thank God!)  8. \\"Life on a Film Set\\" - oh boy, more Buggles. Right from the start of the recording I remembered the middle partof \\"Machine Messiah\\" where the melody is melancholy and sung with an acoustic guitar... the song seems to have a boring chorus seems to be getting nowhere... suddenly another riff comes in, and the track suddenly shines surprisingly. I liked the second rhythmic part. Very energetic, actually somewhat interesting!   9. \\"Hour of Need\\" - well, I like it too... kinda. It's a 100% great song from Steve Howe. What stops me from praising it more is Anderson not singing on it.  10. \\"Solitaire\\" - he could have recorded \\"Second Initial\\" as part of an actual Yes album (after all it was conceived during Yes in their 70s and was played on plenty of Yes concerts). He opted to go with something new. Alas, the track is not interesting. Masquerade, last previous solo acoustic effort on a Yes album is miles ahead, imo.  11. \\"Into the Storm\\" - an attempt to repeat/re-interpret \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" and Tempus Fugit. They succeed... again kinda. The track would have been so much better with Anderson instead of that tribute band guy.   12. \\"Hour of Need (Full-length version)\\" - is no better or worse than the edit, despite the instrumental segments before and after the primary acoustic part... the instrumental segments are nice, but I could live either with or without them.    So, what do we have in the end? \\"Drama II\\"? In a way, only \\"Fly from Here\\" is worse, because it is compiled of left-over \\"Drama I\\" material and songs, which do not go that far exploring other directions from previous \\"The Ladder\\" and \\"Magnification\\".  I would put this album below Drama and just above Talk. I am very disappointed. 10 friggin' years I've been waiting for a Yes album and this is what I get!! I'll be even more upset if this is the last record by Yes ever, because this is NOT the way I would want their career to end. I will keep praying that Anderson will come back and that they will develop into a long suite \\"Golden Age\\" for instance, a great track from the Paris sessions, which sounds far more interesting than \\"Fly From Here\\"    Yet again, I am convinced that Yes and Buggles don't mix (or better to say shouldn't mix), because something good of this union comes in very rare cases, which I can count with less than 5 fingers.    Definitely gives this album a spin though, who knows, maybe you will find it very nice. Even if you find at least one track on it, which you really like, then you won't have listened to it in vain, right?    P. S. Mind you, all written above is JUST my IMHO, just another perspective of a usual person... as for my constant \\"would-have-been-better with Anderson\\", I personally think that he is the cornerstone member of Yes. I heard that on ABWH. On that album, I didn't care whether Chris' bass was there. It would have been a nice addition, the record would have more weight, but I could live without it. On Drama and on Fly from Here however, Anderson's vocals is the missing ingredient, which, in my view, makes those records sound so much worse compared to others...

B0009IW98O|4.0|There seems to be a new resurgence of interest in 1970s music, particularly among today's 15 - 25 year olds. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenage sons and their friends are regularly asking me for recommendations of lesser known 1970s bands. They all know about Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the like, but they are not familiar with most of the lesser known 1970s bands.<br /><br />To assist others looking for lesser known 1970s music, I'm posting recommendations of 1970s bands and albums that aren't very well known but are worth the attention of a new generation of listeners.<br /><br />Bob Seger's Smokin' O.P.'s, released in 1972, is one such album.<br /><br />Bob Seger is best known for his work with the Silver Bullet Band. While the Silver Bullet Band material was really good, it was produced in fairly slick and polished formula that took away much of raw energy that blasted out of Bob Seger's earlier recordings, like Smokin' O.P.'s.<br /><br />This album is mostly covers of other artists' material but most if it is great stuff. Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock\\" and Bo Diddley's \\"Bo Diddley\\" are flat out, high energy rockers. Tim Hardin's \\"If I Were A Carpenter\\" was originally a folk ballad but Seger adds some real drive to it here.<br /><br />For those of you who only know Bob Seger from his Silver Bullet Band days, this album will show you a side of Seger you've never heard before.<br /><br />Smokin' O.P.'s is not one of those really great classic albums but it's still a very good one - it's well worth the current price of less than $7 on Amazon.<br /><br />If you like this album, keep an eye out for another Bob Seger album from 1972 called, appropriately enough, \\"Back In 72\\". It doesn't seem to be available on CD but if you see a decent vinyl copy in a 2nd hand record store, grab it. I don't know why Seger's early material like Mongrel, Ramblin' Gamblin' Man and Back In 72 aren't available on CD. There seems to be a demand (perhaps not a huge demand, but still a demand) for these early Seger albums so I'm surprised someone hasn't packaged up a early Bob Seger set on CD. Bob, if you're reading this, what's up with that?a demand) for these early Seger albums so I'm surprised someone hasn't packaged up a early Bob Seger set on CD.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|I must admit I wasn't sure I'd like this movie. When I heard the Family Friendly, religious/spiritual, Christian appellations being thrown around i was skeptical. I avoided it in the theaters because of this - my mistake.   Even with the outstanding cast of Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt, Keven Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and the lovely irrepressible AnnaSophia Robb, I was wary. I was wrong.  I knew it was about Bethany Hamilton and remembered the 2003 shark attack incident but that was about it. After reading up about her online and watching some You Tube videos I decided to give it a try. I loved it! Not as sappy sentimental as I feared it would be, not as 'preachy' as I expected it to be and definitely not as cheesy as most of these type of films are. This is a professionally made story of a surfer girl, a champion athlete, who happens to live her Christian witness every day of her life and actually believes in a matter of fact way you don't often see portrayed on film.   The surfing scenes are real, not hopped up or CGI exaggerated for excitement, this is the authentic thing. The acting is very good to outstanding. The story is beautiful and presents a real family as normal with normal problems but not dysfunctional as so many other movies both regular and Christian do for dramatic effect.  Granted, they do live in Paradise (according to many, not me, never wanted to go there) and the laid back lifestyle is revealed in all its happiness and joy that many who live there brag about.  I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to be uplifted regardless if they are Christian or not, religious/spiritual or not but can appreciate life to the full.
0440423023|4.0|I like Lee Child's writings, even those that I do not give a high rating to are interesting, just suffer from too many errors, making me stop and think about what I am reading instead of gliding on through enjoying it all. Every author makes errors, some small, maybe even undetectable for the most part and requires someone to point them out. However even major errors do not detract from \\"The Hard Way\\" so I am not going to belabor them, other reviews may do so. The initial kidnapping and payment start out well, Reacher as usual knows all about kidnapper's thinking. But that is not the main point, Child is not writing for endurance, he is hitting on contemporary events and keeping them interesting, knowing that the future will not pay his use of them much notice and they will not last. In this case Blackwater is in the headlines, foreign mercenaries are being killed and the military's use of them is becoming known and criticized. Lane in the book is not the equal of Prince in Iraq, and former mercenaries poor showings in Africa are not mentioned, I do not know if Child had planned on referring to them or not but I did not see it in the book. After all. Reacher is operating in America and that is where the kidnapping is occurring.  However the money is good and there is plenty of it to be made as mercenaries. Child brings up certain elite groups of the military, perhaps making them a little better than they really are but the U. S. is not expert in the type of training needed for the black arts, silent murders, torture for knowledge, and other like training. In the book, there is little to go on, there is much more theory than usual and less mayhem. The book lets us know Reacher has slipped in his thinking, it is not correct but there is more going on anyhow, finding out about Lane's background, his former marriage, and his behavior as regards his troops. he needs someone killed, put him in the front lines, the bible is a good teacher. Reacher is supposedly being hiredand paid by Lane but he is working against him, he has his own scruples. To give more would be to give away the ending. Suffice to say Reacher works thing out and I found it reasonable if not convincing but it was still a good story. I hope the next ones are as good.

1933633867|5.0|Not only is the book fantastic (still reading), it may be the most important book on economics, primarily for the \\"non-experts, i.e. the victims\\", in the past few decades.  This book is not just about the concept and history of debt, it is the first book I've come across that profoundly and practically challenges the phraseology, discourse and semantic superstructure of the contemporary capitalist world system. It obviously takes a whole book (and a good book) to properly deconstruct one single word. We need a whole series.

0446571415|4.0|Is this going to be the last adventure for the members of the Camel Club as the back cover suggests? If it is, we'll have to say \\"well done\\" to David Baldacci for withdrawing his likeable characters at the top of their game. To tell you the truth though I believe that Oliver Stone, who's the driving force behind this series of novels, still has a lot to give, but I guess my opinion doesn't really matter.<br />  As you'd expect from a novel by this author it is action-packed. It begins somewhat slowly, at a leisurely pace, but the narration starts picking up momentum after the first hundred pages, and from that point on it just keeps getting stronger. It soon explodes into a racy thriller, full of twists and turns, with the usual conspiracy theories adding to the mix.<br />  First things first though. It all begins when Stone receives an invitation to visit the White House and meet with the president; an invitation that's even for him impossible to refuse. The president asks the veteran, yet retired, agent to serve his country for the very last time, by taking charge of a high-risk, covert mission. His job is to infiltrate and bring down a Russian cartel, that's supposedly taken over the illegal drugs trade on the American continent. But his mission, even before it begins, is about to change dramatically. A bomb is detonated at a park in front of the White House and Stone accidentally finds himself at the scene of the crime. The intended target was most likely the British prime minister who was just on his way out of the White House, after a meeting with the president. Under the circumstances they have no choice but to ask Stone to work on the case, along with an attractive female MI6 agent, Mary Chapman, and a contact with the FBI.<br />  Before too long though Stone comes to realize that this case will not be an easy one to crack. For every answer he and his co-workers get, a few new questions arise and, as it looks, they are not about to get an easy ride trying to figure things out. There are too many \\"unknowns\\". For starters: How did the bomber or bombers managed to fetch the explosive device into the well guarded park, without setting off any alarms, or even provoking a reaction by the bomb squat's trained dogs? And then questions have to be asked about the people; the strangers who were hanging around there that night. Who was the armed man who bumped onto Stone? What was the woman sitting on a bench and talking on the phone really up to before all that happened? Who was the man that was standing in front of a statue studying its inscription in the middle of the night? What about the fat guy? Did he have anything to do with the explosion or was he simply an innocent bystander and its only victim?<br />  The more they investigate the case, the more the mystery deepens. Their bosses seem to be hiding a lot of crucial evidence from them, while someone is trying now and again to kill Stone. And as time goes by more bodies start piling up. Stone, realizing that he's come to a dead end, once again decides to ask for help from his friends at the Camel Club. But even then things don't seem to quite work out for them, since the people behind the attack always seem to be a step ahead. The investigators receive just bits and pieces of information and now it's up to the ageing agent to connect the dots and find the answer to the riddle; an answer which he doesn't quite expect, since his opponent is a master manipulator; someone who seems to know him better that he knows his self.<br />  This is a well-crafted thriller, as good as you've come to expect from a writer of David Baldacci's caliber.gure things out.

1400079276|5.0|This is the first book by Haruki Murakami that fell into my hands and, even though I came to read more than a handful of his novels and short stories, I still consider Kafka on the Shore his best offering so far. I used to have my doubts about the merit of his work since the man is a star, but after reading this great novel I came to realize that he more than deserves his popularity.<br />  The main characters in this book are actually no more than two: Kafka, a fifteen year old, who runs away from home before he \\"explodes\\", and Nakata, a somewhat mentally challenged old man who's a professional cat detective. These two diametrically different people are bound together with an unseen thread, which obsoletes time and turns the worlds of yesterday and today into one. They are in the centre of the plot, or rather they are the plot, but we also see a few other people hanging about or around, which have some important or not so important role to play in the story: the androgynous librarian Oshima that takes Kafka under his protective wings, just when the youngster arrives at the city; miss Saeki, who seems to be the link between the present and the past; the enigmatic man that goes by the name of Johnny Walker and drives Nakata to the limits of despair; and Hoshino, who for no apparent reason at all, and without giving the matter a second thought, decides to follow Nakata on his quest.<br />  Murakami delivers a story that could be read as a fairytale; where people and times seem to merge together and where mystery sets the ground rules; where the answer to every question is always close at hand, but not the one we expect it to be. His heroes are people with passions and secrets; kept hostage by feelings of guilt and loneliness. They are as lonely as one can ever get. What if they cross paths? What if they feel at a time or another that they are close to each other? In the end it is the loneliness that prevails; it is only in isolation they can exist. The only one of them who seems to have a chance to break the rule is Nakata; because he lives every day as it comes; because, despite his desperate poverty, he is a symbol of the most simple and true values in life, values he can put into words, words he can put into action; unlike Oshima. The latter, a modern day philosopher, somewhere says: \\"Gays, lesbians, straights, feminists, fascist pigs, communists, Hare Krishnas - none of them bothers me. I couldn't care less about the kind of banner they hold. What I cannot stand are empty people...\\"<br />  Fate has some sad times in store for the heroes of this story; but it is fate that in the end brings about the final solution. As the boy that goes by the name of Crow, (Kafka in Czech), says: \\"Sometimes fate looks just like a small sandstorm that changes direction all the time. You change course and it follows you. You turn elsewhere and it adjusts\\".<br />  This book is just like a journey around the two distinct worlds of the souls and of fantasy; a trip into the regions of truth that cannot find their place in the colorless reality we live in. An enjoyable read, by a master storyteller, which every now and then just seems to take the reader's breath away.

This app integrates into my phones UI perfectly.  There is an option to ask you to solve math problems to use the snooze button which I find kind of hilarious.  I tested that myself and it's an interesting way to make sure you are awake.  You can change the difficulty and number of math problems you have to solve.  I recommend this to anyone looking to use their Android phone or tablet as an alarm clock.  Samsung Vibrant and Nationite MIDnite (A81H+)  Update 1/5/12:  I use this app during the week to get up for work and I can honestly say that it is the BEST android alarm app.  The alarm starts low and gets louder gradually.  This doesn't jar me awake like my old bell alarm used to do.  I can easily hit the snooze button without wearing my glasses.  If you are still wondering about whether or not to buy this app, go ahead and buy it.  It's great.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|The good stuff. I can't always understand what Vernon is saying & the liner notes don't help much because I can't read the writing. So I just gotta go with it & be carried along. There is no one stand out track for me, just a real good entire journey from beginning to end. A natural and beautiful progression from 'For Emma' & 'Blood Bank'. Thanks Bon Iver. Do it again! do it again!
1932100660|5.0|This book changed my life. I am a scientist. A skeptical one at that. The facts and evidence-based studies speak for themselves. The best thing you can do to protect your health is read this book. (What have you got to lose, $10? Seems worth it for the thousands you will potentially save on health costs by reading this.)
B000002KYR|5.0|IT Is the best one yet I Like all the song`s on this cd. IT`S a cd that you just put it in and let it play. Elminator was and still the best. good price for this cd. thank you.
B003EV6DBW|4.0|Here's a few short points that i hope helps some people.    Story: Well everyone is gonna have different opinions of course. many will be very critical. I'm a long time who fan and I enjoy this series (season). Would have liked to see them focus more on building up the Doctor verses building up Amy. I mean we all know the Doctor is brilliant but still. Otherwise the story is great. The ending to the series didn't seem as 'epic' as previous series but all in all its a great strart for matt smith and moffat. Definately a must see. And as any who fan will tell you, watching it through more than once really reveals alot you miss the first time.    Content: Simple enough. The was plenty of extras to enjoy. Backrounds on monsters, unseen between episode scenes, confidentials, etc.    Pacakaging: Though I do enjoy the visual art and layout of the outer/inner casing. the quality was a bit flimsy. the outer casing was a very thin cardboard. they included these 3 art cards that costantly slide around and get easily bent cause they slide into the back binding. the inner box was also very bendy.    Playability: I had ordered these and then found out alot of people had issues playing these due to BBC not converting it from 50hz to 60hz. I personally had no problems and didn't have to change any settings, and my player is supposedly one of the ones that doesnt generally play 50hz. i have a sony BDP-S570. I just popped it in and played away! Otherwise the visual quality of the blu-ray is great and am very impressed the deleted scenes and confidentials and monster files were polished to 1080i as well.    Overall a must have for any who fan even if it isn't you favorite season. you can't deny the visual aspect is great and though not the greatest who series definatly a must watch. Enjoy!
0307454541|5.0|My favorite thing about this book is the heroine, Lisbeth Salander. She is one of the most original characters I have read in a long time. I also liked the setting, which is Sweden. This is an excellent suspense story and I cared about the characters from the beginning to the end. I hope the next book in the series will be just as impressive.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is amazing. I have been using the full version for months. It is perfect. I can&apos;t recommend it enough!
1416589473|5.0|I've been really excited for the new MMO to come out, so to help with my anxiousness I decided to buy Ghosts of Ascalon. I'm usually a little critical when it comes to game lore books because quite frankly their aren't many, in my opinion, worth reading. This book however was a very good read.     The relationship between characters was fun and entertaining, the back story's were well written and really gave me a good interpretation of each of their personalities. The plot was fun and exciting with plenty of history included as well. I thought how they included the history of Ascalon, Tyria, etc. very well done. It didn't seem like it was boring or drawn out. The ending was good and left you wanting more.     All in all, whether you be a Guild Wars fan or just a Fantasy lover Ghosts of Ascalon is definitely worth buying!
0553801473|5.0|Received book on day of release.  Found it as intriguing and exciting as the other four books in the series.  I am hoping the next book in the series comes out real soon.
0061928356|5.0|I loved this simple heart-warming book.  I was pulled into the characters and plot from the first page and when I had to put the book down, I couldn't wait to get back to it. The switch back and forth between characters and locations was smooth and never jarring. Learning the cultural aspects of India was never technical or boring-it flowed honestly through the story.  The characters were honest, too.  They seemed real and interesting.  A wonderful book and an engrossing read.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a perfect sharpener for your back pack, puts a nice edge, but if you want it to take care of all your sharpening needs, I would look elsewere.  It is not what I would use for something that is extremely dull, or had a thick blade.
067144901X|5.0|My 16 month old twins can't get enough of this book. They want to look at it and want us to read it to them every night.  They pick it out over other books. THey know how to do the sound of the cow because of this book. It is so fun to read, I love the pictures and my kids love the book. What more can you ask?
0521397812|5.0|Need a quick warmer  to engage your students? Often neglected, the warmer is an important stage of a fun and dynamic EFL class. This is a great book to keep close by when lesson planning. The activities are easy to use, require no materials and most can be adapted for various levels.<br /><br />Howard Spencer -EES Executive English Solutions Chile
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Not sure why people are downvoting because its been offered for free before on amazon.  Great app and who cares if the devs gave themselves some 5 star infomercial type reviews.  Rate the app itself!
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Others have critisized this film for adding nothing new to the genre, but the quality and depth of the characters is more than enough to make this a film worth watching.
0894803123|5.0|The recipes are easy to follow, delicious, and just amazing. I have to try to manage the portions I eat. No more store-bought ice cream for me.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is the best alarm clock I&apos;ve ever used, including standalone hardware clocks. There are tons of options, including snooze duration and alarm crescendo. I bought it a while back and don&apos;t regret it for a second.\nMy only feature request would be to have it play a random MP3 from a set, but I&apos;ve never seen another alarm app do that either.\nAnyway, get it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book.  One of my favorite novels written in the last 5 years or so.  Unique plot line and though a little twisted, a real page turner.
B0035G5IOE|1.0|This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I am now convinced that movie reviewers are on the film maker's payrolls, at least in this case. I couldn't even finish the movie. Please save your money and buy another movie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|For several months now, and I simply cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nFor those wondering why all the reviews are 5 stars, it&apos;s because this is simply a great alarm. Stop pretending like you are a Jedi trying to bring balance to the force and write an honest review based on your own opinion. And just because the reviews use prior grammar and punctuation does not mean that a dev wrote it. It means that the person who  typed it gives a damn about the way they speak.
1451629184|5.0|I could hardly put the book down.....the abuse she suffered, both sexual and mental, and the horrible conditions she lived with would most certainly be more than most could endure.  The young Jaycee showed more maturity in how she dealt with these perverted kidnappers/abusers than many older female kidnap victims would have.  She is definitely a survivor and a very forgiving soul as well.  We can all learn a great lesson from her. She not only deserves my compassion but she definitely has my respect!  God bless you, Jaycee!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this workout a few months ago, based on many positive reviews. Wow, I could not believe how challenging this workout was when I first started using it. I could not even get through the entire workout for level 1 without stopping several times; and I am not a completely sedentary person. That being said, the workout is amazing and you will definitely see results. Jillian is a no nonsense trainer and I like that about this video. I also like how she shows you the correct and incorrect ways to do the moves, as this helps to prevent injury. I'm on week 3 and level 2. Slower than I'm supposed to go, but like I said it IS a challenge.
0553801473|1.0|GRRM needs an editor who would give him a kick up his backside and tell him to get on with it ... i'm about 3/4 of the way through - and nothing has happened ... i'm going to search for a wiki somewhere to tell me what happens - i can't bear to complete the book.
1878424319|1.0|Despite how short the book is, I couldn't get past the first chapter - It's 20-some pages were enough to convey how bad the book is.  In short, the author's writing is beyond horrible and ineffective, he never uses examples when that's exactly what would help illustrate his point, and he rarely has any sort of coherent, logical point to begin with.  Honestly... I'm pretty bad at writing, I pretty much never do it, and never really write reviews either. However I read enough in general to know good/decent writing from garbage.  I honestly felt like the book was written by someone in the 10-15 year old age range... I'm being honest and am not saying this to try and insult the author, it's just the truth.  FYI, my main motivation for writing this review was to try and up the number of 1-Star reviews, because with the current large majority of 5-Star reviews (as of this writing), the consensus at first glance seems to be that this is a flawless treasure of a book, when the reality is the complete opposite.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|the best clock on the market without question. I have been using the free version for months and have never had any problems. I wish the morons would stop giving one star reviews for no reason. Great app without question.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve been using this alarm app for a few months now and it is the best in the market, no contest! The features are awesome and the updates are timely. Works great on Gingerbread. Couldn&apos;t live without this app!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve been using the free version for months. I love it  thank you amazon for giving us this one for free
0790729725|1.0|This was supposed to be a brand new movie. When I recieved it it was not wrapped in plastic and the disc clearly has been used it is full of scratches!
B0047E6LW6|5.0|First, if you're a fan of early King Diamond,(in his Black Rose days even), Venom, Diamond Head, or just want to experience something different in this cookie cutter world, then buy this record. If you know what NWOBHM stands for, then you'll especially like it.<br /> I like Opus Eponymous, a lot. My opinion, it's the rock/metal album of the year so far. Songs are solid, musical, melodic, progressive, and have a flavour that is unique, and yet familiar. Vocals are clean, articulate, smooth, and spooky all at once. (If singing about satan bothers you, or goes against your belief system, then you might just walk on by). Guitars are especially noteworthy here. Old school Marshall tones, not crushing modern, but good classic tube overdriven amp-to-guitar, gain on 7, sounds. I like that aspect a lot about their sound. This band is very musical. Not every band can incorporate a pipe organ here and there and pull it off. And finally production is crisp, clean, up front, but retains that classic sound and feel.<br />The bottom line; '70's hard rock/prog sound, Blue Oyster Cult type vocals, Satanic themes, excellent production. Buy it and try something new. Unless, you're scared of the dark.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is my first review and I have to say this is a very good app. wish I waited for the free version but it is well worth the money.
B0030BYWKU|5.0|This CD is a wonderful buy. I loved all the songs on it and that's saying a lot because most CDs I buy have only a few songs I like. A true quality buy! I hate CDs that only have 2 or 3 songs that are good and everything else is just there to fill the rest of the CD. Jason CD doesn't do that and all 9 songs are excellent. They all make you want to get up and move to the beat! If you even like 1 of Jason songs, you would probably like the rest too! I recommend this product!
1451629184|5.0|I loved Jaycee Dugard's book, A Stolen Life. It was hard to read in certain parts because of the trauma she endured, but it helped me understand why she felt that she couldn't ask for help or run away when she was older. I think a lot of folks wonder about that. My questions went away after knowing what caused her to be in such a place emotionally where she felt utterly hopeless and defenseless.     I have read other reviewers criticize this book saying that it was poorly written or unedited, but I disagree. I think she did a fantastic job with this book. It kept me interested and emotionally engaged. In the beginning, it seems to jump around a bit, but I loved that about the book because it gives a glimpse into the confusion she must of felt as a child, as well as kept me on a roller-coaster of emotions. If you do not emotional like roller-coasters, this book is not for you. I sensed that Jaycee pours her heart the best she can into her own words onto the pages of this book.     Toward the end of the book when she is talking about present day and her future, her writing becomes more mature and it is evident that she has a deep love for learning, as she is a self-taught writer (with a 5th grade education) who has the talent and imagination to capture audiences for generations to come. I personally, am eager to read whatever she writes next. I'd love to read her fictional works because she has so much suppressed imagination that when it finally comes out onto paper, we will be wowed with her work.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Wow, I love this movie! I watched it over and over again and never got tired of watching it. This movie is a classic now. I loved watching  Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock. All went on and had great film careers after this movie too. I really recommend this movie whoever love action fighting, great fighting, and there's some romance in there too. ha ha
B004VMVTNU|5.0|works great on my HTC thunderbolt. so many options to set alarm from . downloading for free is awesome .
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have had this app forever. It has never once failed me. I wake each morning exactly the way I choose, with music gently getting louder and a set number of snoozes before I answer three hard math questions to turn it off.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Slips on easily. Thin enough to keep the look/feel of the iPhone 4, thick enough to feel protective.  Very clear, fits better than the Marware bumper.  Screen protector went on easily with a couple bubbles I worked out with my fingernails.  Great case for the price.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|Alarmclock plus works better it can announced time and show up on the lock screen instead of the notification bar\n\nPrice doesn&apos;t sway me as long as it works and have the features I want
B0017HRCQU|5.0|I bought this because I am a huge Batman fan and love the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. This guy is a visionary. The limited Giftset edition is a plus. You get a set of added content that I don't think you will be able to get anywhere else. The movie in Blu Ray is just perfect 10/10. If you're a fan then get this
B003YL4LYI|1.0|A long awaited sequal.  I loved the other books in the series.  However, the delays had made me lose much interest, but I was shopping for a new book the day this came out and thought I would give it a try.  This is one of the few books I have purchased and read where I feel I deserve a refund.  It was horrible.  The writing was uninteresting.  The author uses dozens of the same phrases over and over again to the point of tedium.  The story barely moves and any originality that was once in the series has disappeared.  It is like reading a bad story by a high school writer.<br /><br />The thing that used to be original about this series was the author's courage to build up charactors only to maim or kill them and his use of desires to flesh out the characters.  Now the author seems to like to use dirty words for the hell of it, with most not having any bearing on the story at all.  Where once you were not sure who would die or get hurt, it is now abundantly clear from the beginning of each chapter what is going to happen.  This has all gotten stale.<br /><br />This will be the end of the series for me.  I wish I had listened to my gut and ended it one book sooner.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One word pretty sums this movie up....Perfect. I love it and get it blu ray, watch it on a 120Hz Sony Bravia using a playstation 3 with Bose 321 GS Speakers and wake the neighbourhood up. This movie is soo incredible. Get it
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Nice App With lots of useful features. I used the free version until this one showed up for free on Amazon. The numb nuts that complain about the GPS need to do some research about the app before they review it. Then maybe they will get a clue. As important as you think you are nobody cares who you are or where you go. The GPS is just simply for on feature of the app that you don&apos;t have to use.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve been using the free version for several months now and it has worked great. Upgraded to the full version thanks to amazon&apos;s free app of the day. Great no ads now! Even the free version has all of the features you could want in an alarm and some you never knew you wanted like solving math problems to disable the alarm in the morning when you don&apos;t really want to get out of bed.
0307595579|5.0|We had been looking at getting this trilogy for quite some time.  We had read the first two books and also watched their theatrical counterparts.  As always, the books are far superior, but the movies were good, too.    We had seen this set at our local Books A Million and did not want to pay the $100+ price, so we kept walking past it, wishing we could get it.  Then we tried Amazon.  SWEET DEAL!!!!  More than 50% off the shelf price!!    The set is amazing.  The style of hardcover is a great throwback and the added ON STEIG LARSON is a welcome add on.      We are looking forward to re-reading the first two books and finishing up the trilogy.
B003Y5HWGI|2.0|I must say even this mediocre season's DVD cover is irritating. Why they put Renée on the front like she is the lead character? Actually in some episodes we see her in like 10 minutes.  Re-organize this stupid cover please. ANYONE AGREE?
B002VRZEYM|5.0|After seeing this, you will look for words like, \\"grass fed\\", \\"free range\\", \\"raised without hormones or antibiotics\\", and such, when buying meat, poultry or eggs.  Or, you may be so moved as to avoid the risk, health hazards and shopping hassles, and become vegetarian or vegan.  The film is that compelling.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Without question, one of the finest recordings of music I will ever hear.  If you don't get it, I don't get you.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|As others have said.... STOP WHINING.   This is such a great app!  I&apos;ve used the free version for quite a while and it&apos;s great.  You&apos;ll run out to say something negative just because you can??   Have you even tried the app?   You&apos;re complaining about permissions...did you even look at what they&apos;re for before giving a 1star rating?   To sum up... Great app... pathetic reviewers.
B0053F042G|5.0|What if we were able to stop a crime from happening with future technology. 'Source code' enters us into a 'what if' scenario that tests science's ability to enter the body's of others and solve crimes before they happen. From beginning to end the film was full of suspense and allowed viewers to try in solve the mystery with the main character. I definitly would recommend 'Source Code' to anyone who's interested in a sci-fi action drama.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|If you ask anyone who knows me, I'm not a morning person. I generally don't like to wake up to alarms because they are unnerving. However, I do need the best alarm app on my smartphone to kick start my day. With Alarm Clock Extreme, I could set my preferences so that I won't get jolted by the noise. I can still set the alarm to play an obnoxious ringtone but it would slowly crescendo to the maximum volume I want. Furthermore, I like the shake and math features. I have to do a physical activity to snooze my alarm and then a mental activity to dismiss it. By then I'm fully awake, in mind and body. Great job Angle Labs!
B004FJJGBG|5.0|I bought a 3d player quite some time ago and I was mildly impressed with the technology. Let me just say this about Avatar \\"Damn good movie!\\". It is very expensive but I think it is worth the price of admission. Get this movie!!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Currently, my Amazon Cloud Player library contains 22,884 songs.  I love using the web-based Cloud Player on my pc to listen to music while at work.  Unfortunately, with the amount of music I have, the Android App (HTC EVO 4G) becomes very slow and crashes frequently.  I think problems are caused because the app is trying to locally cache my music library's index, so the app knows what music is available to stream from the Cloud Player's server.  The AmazonMP3 App's Data usage grows to just over 54MB after downloading the \\"index\\".  And that data stays on Android's internal memory, also causing space shortages on my phone.    Once playing music, the app does a good job.  Rarely do I hear skips during a song, even while streaming over 3G connections, and song playback starts within reasonable time of hitting play.    I would like to see Amazon refine the the AmazonMP3 App to work more efficiently with larger Cloud Player libraries.  Then it would become THE cloud-based player for me.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|I just saw this film yesterday and left the theater flying on a cloud of intense bliss.   This movie is a visual feast for the senses delivering millions of calories in pure delight and challenges us to interpret the story by perceiving the emotions from our individual perspectives - in many ways each reaction to this work is contingent on how we relate to the characters - the existential theme is universally understood.   Every viewer will insert their own life experiences to absorb what this epic means to them.   It's very much like a chemical reaction to our individual spiritual biology.    Every shot was perfectly choreographed by Malick's perfectionist eye.   Somewhere in the great beyond - Stanley Kubrick is smiling because another gifted director has grabbed the baton that he launched with his epic style of storytelling.   Malick is our modern day Michelangelo who has waited to make this masterpiece on HIS terms  and kept it on his drawing board for decades until he could execute it on his terms.   From my chair - I'd say he succeeded in building HIS Sistine Chapel ... a masterpiece for all time.   My only wish would be to see this on an IMAX screen.   I predict it will be taught in film schools and dissected for decades to come.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really good puzzle game. the music is very peaceful :-) I enjoy the rain effects in the background. it was definitely worth the dollar.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|This is an inspirational film, which is a type that I usually do not care for because they end up being sappy and weepy. Thank goodness this one did not fit into that category.  It is uplifting and honest without being gooey or too heavy-handed, and it also addresses the moments of despair that even the faithful will have.      Recommended.
0545123275|4.0|I liked this serie very much! I found it poetic and sensitive. The romance was quite cute and had depth.        I run through them quite quickly and I'm very excited about Forever (book 3).        Already read reviews on it and my fear of a poor ending seems quite unfounded. Grace/Sam are a great couple and Isabel/Cole is promising.      More to say, when I'll read Forever this week-end...        More reviews on my blog (link on my profile page)
B0054JZC6E|1.0|can&apos;t watch the game and touch the screen to play.  better app if I had a mouse not a touchscreen.

B00005N6KG|5.0|These are my spare pairs, just in case, I still have my first pair from 5-6 years ago, still working! (First pair still working, and sound just like the new ones!)<br /><br />Some pros.... These don't cause that dangerous sound pressure that most do, as they do not plug up the ear, you can hear other thing going on around you, if necessary! Great frequency response, I have used them for professional mixes... ( Pro Tools / Waves Mercury Plugin Suite / Propellerhead Reason / Record for years!) They are very light weight... you can rip them off your head very easily, I have done this many times, not realizing that they were still on my head. See below, wear them loosely, they work better that way, it is hard to get used to a pair of headphones that weight practically nothing... But, it is worth it! GREAT HEADPHONES! I am sold time and time again! Don't stop making these, no improvements needed, and the design has not changed in years, EXCELLENT! Very satisfied customer! I use a chain around my neck to support the cord from so I can't rip the headphones off my ears anymore when the cord gets into a bind, that does hurt and could destroy the headphones! STILL I WILL SAY, for the price, (I paid more for them years ago), NICE! A+ on design!<br /><br />Some Cons.... As I have owned a pair for years, The cord does seem flimsy, don't jerk on it, as I have said, my first pair has lasted 5-6 years. Don't put them tight on your head. Click them to a tight fit, then unclick one side one notch or two, this will make them feel great on your head, and it will allow the bass to return..(Frequency response is better with them loose fitting) as the bass will go flat if you fit them tightly, And then they will hurt your ears, I know this mistake! Wear them semi-loosely... I would express caution to those who use them to jog with, moisture could clog up the headphone part, just as dirt can, cleaning them, as I have this first pair has kept them going for years!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|didn&apos;t expect it to be so much fun. lots of levels, some easy and some very challenging. but loads of fun for a first defense game.
0553801473|1.0|I called this review the end of a saga because that's what this book is-the end. This is by far the worst book I have read this year and it is the last George RR Martin book I will ever read. I hate saying that because I was a fan before this one. Book three was a bit tiresome but there were new characters to build so I was okay with it. I don't even know who the characters are anymore but boy are they boring! By the end of the book I was hoping the dragons would go on a spree and just kill off everyone. I work in a bookstore and I had recommended this series to people, bet they never trust my judgment again.I see no way he save the series with the next 2 books because no one will remember enough to want to read anymore of this story and if they try to reread they will stop with this book. I'm really sorry George but you blew it and so did your editors by letting you run( on and on and on) with this story line. All through the book nothing new happens and then in the last few chapters you start killing off people and for no apparent reason except to get rid of them. I guess HBO wanted more filler for the series which I now know is doomed as well. Don't buy this book- you will be completely disappointed.
B0030T1NAO|1.0|I live in Europe and I just spend more than $ 100 (including customs) on the Breaking Bad seasons 1, 2 and 3. Unfortunately I can't play them. However, this information is nowhere to be found. Not on Amazon, not on the box, not on the internet-database. The only way to find out is after spending a lot of money and putting the disc in the player. You get a screen which says to look on the box for more information.

B003E6K1VK|3.0|I am not an 'audiophile,' and cannot tell the difference between a FLAC rip of a CD and a rip at 320kbps, but I do have some mid-range headphones and wanted to see if a portable DAC/amplifier would improve the sound quality. But for full disclosure - I was happy with the sound quality before I bought this item, so my thoughts may be a bit skewed because of my expectations.    APPEARANCE/INTERFACE: The device looks nifty and has a clean-looking interface, but I found it a bit difficult to navigate. After using it a couple of weeks, navigation still did not feel intuitive and I was often pressing the wrong buttons. The velourish pouch it comes with its not particularly useful to me as I don't really take the devise with me anywhere. Additionally, if you put it in the rubber case it comes with, it makes it difficult to then put it inside the pouch.     SOUND QUALITY: With my Sennheiser HD555's (which I have no problems with and enjoy the sound from), I noticed a slight improvement in sound quality. The mid-range was clearer and overall the sound was more even across the frequencies, which may appeal to some critics of Sennheiser's sound. The improvement was noticeable but not overwhelming by any stretch. The bass boost is probably the most effective feature, and for bassy songs it augments the sound the best.    USE WITH EQUIPMENT: I've used it both with my computer's SoundBlaster card and with my iPod. It improves the sound better on the computer than the iPod, but that is probably to be expected given the iPod's weak amp. I've never used it with more high end headphones or high end sound cards, so it is possible I have not experienced its full potential. However if I had more high-end products, I doubt I'd feel the need to use a portable amp/DAC.    BATTERY: While I generally use it as a DAC plugged in via USB, the battery life seems sufficient when in use. However when not in use, the battery drains within a few days, and if charging by USB, you must wait about 10-15 minutes for it to charge before you can use it.    Given these considerations and the manner in which I use it, I would not buy it again for its price (~$100), as it does not produce a $100 improvement in sound for the hardware I have.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I don't know how I lived without this app. My phone feels so organized now its sick--in a good way! Folder Organizer is perfect for gathering all the apps trolling around your phone and placing them in easy access folders. I love the personalization factor of the app i.e. choosing your own icons and folder names for each file. Nothing beats having one-click access to all your important apps. Until I started organizing my phone using this app I didn't realize how much crap I had on it :-)     If you're looking for ease of use, easy personalization, and a simplistic way to organize all your apps--get this app! It's not often I say this about paid apps, but this one is definitely worth the price! Definitely a Top 10 Favorite!!    HTC Evo 4g

B001F0ORDU|5.0|The movie brought back memories of the good ole days when Carrie and gang roamed the streets of New York on a weekly basis! While I enjoyed the film I felt like the storyline was too rushed. If anything this could have easily been stretched out into another season--hint hint! I know they want to make more SATC films, but ultimately the films will always fall short because they leave the fans wanting so much more. More characters, more depth, longer storylines. Oh well. In the interim at least we have the series on DVD and the movie to keep us entertained. I'd skip the second film, and go with this one instead. This one felt more like an extension of the series, giving it some finallity. I give it Two Manola Blahnik's!    Also I love that this is available on Amazon Instant Video as a download! Thank you Amazon!!!
0452286751|5.0|After reading Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD or ATLAS SHRUGGED, you feel as though you've been spoiled forever, because you realize that, henceforth, few authors are likely to afford you the sense of rapturous enjoyment you've come to expect from a literary masterpiece.  And the reason I ardently recommend Rand's novels -- even go out of my way to purchase them gratuitously for friends or acquaintances whom I suspect have the mind and soul to appreciate them -- is because it gives me the vicarious pleasure to re-experience through these first-time readers the powerful writing and deep-probing insight into human nature contained in both these outstanding works.<br /><br />One of the most startlingly dramatic paragraphs from THE FOUNTAINHEAD appears when the brilliant, but villainous, Ellsworth Toohey (disingenuous champion of the \\"common man\\"...ridiculing denouncer of human intelligence...unrepentant hater of human ability and achievement) eagerly reveals the true nature of his iniquitous soul to an equally brilliant adversary (Dominique Francon), whom he realizes has the intellectual capacity to understand his evil...and the moral integrity to despise him precisely for it.  Looking out over the radiant lights of New York City, Toohey softly utters to her the following:<br /><br />\\"Look at it.  A sublime achievement, isn't it?  A heroic achievement.  Think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the millions who profit by it.  And it is said that but for the spirit of a dozen men, here and there down the ages, but for a dozen men - less, perhaps - none of this would have been possible.  And that might be true.  If so, there are - again - two possible attitudes to take.  We can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are all fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit, and that we are glad to accept it in gratitude and brotherhood.  Or, we can say that by the splendor of their achievement which we can neither equal nor keep, these twelve have shown us what we are, that we do not want the free gifts of their grandeur, that a cave by an oozing swamp and a fire of sticks rubbed together are preferable to skyscrapers and neon lights - if the cave and the sticks are the limit of our own creative capacities.  Of the two attitudes, Dominique, which would you call the truly humanitarian one?  Because, you see, I'm a humanitarian.\\"<br /><br />Only Ayn Rand could have captured with such incisive subtlety the essence of human evil.e twelve have shown us what we are, that we do not want the free gifts of their grandeur, that a cave by an oozing swamp and a fire of sticks rubbed together are preferable to skyscrapers and neon lights - if the cave and the sticks are the limit of our own creative capacities.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app received 4.5 stars on the market. Good app. 1 star reviews are fake and are written by a competitor. I am a professional writer and I recognize that all 1 star reviews all say the same thing, so they are all fake. Developer, dont let these morons who wouldnt know a verb from a noun discourage you. I think you would have better things to do than compose fake reviews. On the other hand, the 1 star morons have nothing better to do.

B0053Y961M|5.0|This 4-CD set is something of a Little Richard Complete '50s set - and that's a very original idea! Richard recorded about 20 songs for the End label in 1959, all traitional Gospel and most of them very impressive, as Richard, for the first time, exhibited his Operatic tendencies. Some really astonishing performances of songs like \\"God Is Real\\" and \\"Does Jesus Care?\\", plus an uptempo, \\"Certainly, Lord\\", which could have found a nice spot on any of his Specialty albums. The big news is that (it appears) that the \\"long-lost\\" alternate version of Maybelle Jackson's \\"I'm Quittin' Show Business\\" has finally found a way onto CD!<br /><br />The End tracks are taken (except for one) from two 1960 albums, which (appear) to present the numbers in their original, undubbed form. (i.e., Coral Records, Guest-star Records, etc., added percussion, on later records). It should be noted that the pressings are excellent, though presumptively right off the plastic.<br /><br />A real tastey treat are two lesser-known tunes, released here (apparently) for the second time only: \\"Lucille\\" and \\"Long Tall Sally\\" by Little Richard And The Upsetters, live on radio, from Australia, near the end of that legendary tour.<br />The first issue contains a fascinating live interview with a thoughtful artist, who says he's planning on becomming an Evangelist, upon return home. That would have fit in perfectly here, but........<br /><br />The additional \\"Sally\\" is from Richard's 1956 movie appearance. Sounds kinda cool with the 2/4 clappin' goin' on, but....why not that Interview, noted above, in its' place? No problem, I'm ready, ready, ready to plunk the disk back in the chamber...and say, Oh My Soul!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I got this app recently. The UI is simple and easy to use. There are a few great features included too. But those can be accessed by hitting \\"Settings\\" and do not clutter the home screen. There is a countdown timer too! :)    My only issue is that most of my alarms are from Monday to Friday (weekdays) or from Monday to Sunday (week long). Hence, for each of these alarms I have to select each day by hitting on it. It it had an option like \\"Weekdays\\" and \\"Everyday\\", it would make it so much more easier.    Other than that, I think this app is a keeper! Love it! :)
B004XJHBCE|4.0|I love this app much better than the stock version, it just does so much more! I love being able to change the icon, and being able to have apps in multiple folders. \n\nThe problem I have is the icons on my home screen just start spazzing out randomly (getting lines that look like static running through the icons, they don&apos;t just stay in one spot either, the lines jump around within the icons), resetting my phone or changing skin on my home screen fixes it for a short time, but it always starts again. I&apos;m not sure, but it may be a conflict on my phone, since it doesn&apos;t seem like a common issue. I wish there was a way to find out the problem. :(
B002VWNID6|2.0|First off....I love this movie! It may not be the best Robin Hood but it is entertaining! That being said...This SPECIAL version SUCKS! About half way through the movie stopped....Just Stopped.  Lucky another reviewer left a comment about the other half of the movie being on the other side of the disc.  Why they did that? No clue....Is it a pain? YES!  I wish that I would have bought a different version with better picture quality. I guess I will have to do that when they come out with the next big thing and DVD's are obsolete!
0385737955|1.0|Awful. Terrible. Waste of money! The book was way too descriptive. I had to re-read whole pages because the author's writing left my head spinning. I read part of the first chapter in the store, and in has a really good hook, so I was looking forward to reading it! But holy crap! It went from interesting to long and boring really fast. It was so boring it took me 2-3 months to finish this short book when I usually finish books in 2-3 days. I forced myself to keep reading to see if it would get better by the ending....well, it didn't.     I usually keep every book that I buy because I love to read ( and I do re-read books that I like), but as soon as I finished this book I was soooo disappointed that I took it straight to the used book store. With a title like that this author could have done so much more.    A comparison would be like when you see a preview for a movie that looks SO AWESOME!! and you cannot wait to see it...then when you finally do you realize that they showed all of the good parts in the preview and what is left is 2hours and 30 min. of boring, no plot, crap.    I would give this book zero stars if I could.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Unfortunately, I missed out on this movie until late 2010, but having watched it for the second time last night, I feel compelled to write a review on the movie.<br /><br />Ellen Page absolutely KILLED it in this movie.  She stole the show, and she got ROBBED of an Academy Award in 2007 for Best Actress (which she was rightfully nominated for).  In typical Academy fashion, they gave it to an actress no one has ever heard of, in a movie that no one has ever seen \\"La Vie En Rose\\".  An obscure selection left Ellen Page without a rightfully deserved Oscar.  A shame, she was robbed.<br /><br />I read one page worth of the 1-star reviews on here, and I had to shrug my shoulders in disbelief.  I think a good portion of them were probably written by women or girls with a lot of self-esteem issues.  Were they turned off by Ellen Page's beauty?  Trying to read into some of the reviews, they didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Juno has virtually everything you look for in a movie.  It was a good story, great acting, great production, great music, with great direction.  Can't really accept anything below 4 or 5 stars as being legit.  There's something else going on with those reviewers, that prevented them from taking in a Top 250 movie of all-time.<br /><br />For those of who you haven't seen this movie, do yourselves a favor and rent it ASAP.  If you're even a relatively normal person, you'll enjoy it just as much as I, and most other people have.
0553801473|4.0|While not as terrific as Martin's second and third installments of A Song of Ice and Fire, I disagree with much of the sentiment posited here before me. Martin is the master of never giving the reader what they want all the while serving it up just as engrossing if not more. The first half of the book stalled me a bit, but by halfway through I couldn't put it down, like all of the parts before it. While I disagree with some of the directions he's taken the characters, he has never let me down before, and I am confident that it is all part of a master plan of his making.

B004HD61KE|5.0|The very first book I read authored by James Rollings -  The Devil Colony.  I am now HOOKED!!!  So I printed out a list of everything he has written and am now starting back at the beginning of the Sigma series with SANDSTORM.  He is now my new favorite author.  You can tell that he really puts in hours and hours and hours into his research, and it is quite unique how--at the end of his books--he tells you what is true and what is fiction.  Not only are his books filled with phenomenal stories, they are also teaching tools so we can learn more about history.<br /><br />Please keep writing Mr. Rollins!!!  Your talent knows no bounds.

1878424505|1.0|I'm somewhat surprised that two people recommended this book to me.  How others have not considered these very basic moral principles is beyond me.  Long ago, I realized I must seek my full potential, be truthful to my word, give the benefit of the doubt to others, and seek the truth in others' statements.  These are pretty much the 4 agreements in short.<br /><br />He's basically just saying don't get herded along like a sheep by the facade of lies present everywhere you look in our world.  I'm glad more people will be able to adopt a skeptic's perspective after reading this book.  Welcome to the club, you're a little late, but that's okay.<br /><br />The statement that we all live by our parents principles, doesn't apply to all.  I thought most people made it a point to seek their own opinions about life, but apparently not.<br /><br />In truth, I didn't even finish it because it is rather poorly written.  It lacked the creative dynamic to pull me in... just a little bland.
0553582038|1.0|One could skip this book completely and not miss a beat in the series. It's full of character no one cares about and a hundred pages of rape and murder. Also, Cersei is a sociopath. The end.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I'm a late convert to the cult of Modern Family, but a grateful one, as this is the funniest show I've ever seen.  I bought this set on the advice of a co-worker who would not stop talking about the show, and man was he right about it.    For those even newer to the cult than I am, Modern Family is about an extended family of 11 people:  Jay (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, and his new-ish wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and her 11 year old son Manny (Rico Rodriguez);  Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Ferguson), his boyfriend Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), and their new adopted baby Lily (various);  Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen), her husband Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), and their kids Hailey (Sarah Hyland), who's 15 I think, 14 year old Alex (Ariel Winter), and 10 year old Luke (Nolan Gould).  One thing that the creators did very well was that they made none of the relationships new.  Jay and Gloria had been married for six months at the start of the show, though one episode did flashback to their wedding reception, and Mitchell and Cameron were five years into their relationship, though Lily was brand new.  Phil and Claire were at the 16 year mark, with all the good and bad of that.  The characters are all well off, in a manner, with Jay being pretty affluent, with Mitchell a lawyer and Phil a real estate agent that the crash didn't seem to impact much.  This works well for the show, surprisingly enough, as the comedy centers more on interactions between the characters and outsiders, rather than money issues and what to do.    The strength of the show is of course the ensemble, and it's remarkable how well all of the actors play off each other, no matter what the combination.  You can stick any of the kids with any of the adults and something or someone will come out shining.  In particular Manny is hilarious, he's 11 going on 50, much to the amusement/horror of Jay, without being too 'cute'.  All of the kids are excellent, which is not surprising if you look at their CV's, veterans all, this isn't the first, or tenth, rodeo for any of them.  The adults are all interesting too, and are helped by the fact that there are so many of them.  Phil, played by Emmy nominee Ty Burrell (for both seasons), is the self professed 'cool dad', and at first a little of Phil goes a long way.  But his character develops over the season, and has some poignant moments at times.  Cameron, with Eric Stonestreet's Emmy winning performance, is a bit over the top (Stonestreet is straight in real life), but not glaringly so, and contrasts nicely with Ferguson's button-downed Mitchell.  They're a believable couple, and everyone accepts them, even Jay.  Jay would probably prefer that his son not be gay, but Cameron is included in every family activity, and he and Jay bond over sports and bicker like friends.  Which they are, and it's pretty refreshing.  Ed O'Neill certainly isn't playing a rich Al Bundy (though there are ghostly hints here and there), while Sofia Vergara's Gloria is on some levels the sexy second wife, but she's not superficial in the least and geniunely seems to love Jay.  Julie Bowen plays Claire as an uptight, high strung stay at home mom of three, and watching her get tighter and tighter as the season progressed was interesting.  All of the adult characters have arcs, and evolve.  And none take over, there's no Sheldon Cooper type thing going on here, though he's brilliant.  I can't speak for Season Two though, that's September 20 for a release.    The weaknesses?  Ummm.......well.........yeah, not thinking of any that glare out at you.  Sorry.    This is the best comedy on television (sorry again Big Bang Theory), it hits the five star mark easily and without effort.  Great cast, great writing, terrfic show.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine.  After reading all the great reviews, I was anxious to read it.  The book was very choppy.  New characters were thrown at you in every chapter, and just when you feel you understand who everyone is, the chapter ends and you never hear of the characters again.      Tina Fey tries so hard to describe experiences of her life in a self depreciating, funny way, but it falls flat.  Unfortunately I found her desperate and very unlikeable.     I am just thankful that this was a library book and I didn't pay for it.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|I really like the game a more complex and graphical game of PvZ.  Overall, I would tell people check out the pics of the game and it's worth the couple of bucks to have it.

B004EPYZOO|4.0|Thank goodness Nicolas Cage has gotten his la-de-dah ADAPTATION / LEAVING LAS VEGAS phase out of the way, because now he can really focus on firming up his acting legacy by way of starring in as many cheesy action movies as humanly possible. Look out, Michael Dudikoff.<br /><br />Except that DRIVE ANGRY's outlandish premise is sure-fire bait for cats like me. Nicolas Cage plays \\"John Milton\\" - and how many of you caught that bit of literature? - an undead fugitive what broke out of Hell to avenge his daughter's murder and to save his captive baby grand-child from a Satanic cult. Milton tears thru mythical places such as Laughter, Colorado and Still Water Marsh, Louisiana and, uh, Oklahoma, as he relentlessly tracks the demented cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke). Along the way Milton gains the help of the lovely, two-fisted waitress Piper (Amber Heard), and there they go, tearing off in Piper's wicked 1969 Dodge Charger 440, hellbent for justice, B-movie grindhouse style. But Milton and Piper are racing against the clock. Once the full moon hovers high, Milton's grand-child will be sacrificed in a demonic ritual intended to bring about - and this can only be said in caps - THE END OF THE WORLD (world world world...).<br /><br />Meantime, the demonic Accountant (William Fichtner, all unflappable), the Devil's top repo agent, has been deployed to retrieve Milton, drag the taciturn sucker back to Tartarus, preferably kicking and screaming. The Accountant, with his quirks and that insouciant gleam in his eye, is instantly my favorite character in this film. Nicolas Cage would've done well to have generated a like gleam in his eye. He settles for a bullet hole in the eyeball. Not the same.<br /><br />Thru all the over-the-top splatterfest and the gratuitous nudity and the rampant f-bombs you can almost feel director Patrick Lussier blatantly not apologizing. He set out to make a riproaring, wildly violent grindhouse flick and damnation if he didn't get away with it. Somewhere, Quentin Tarantino just stained his pants. DRIVE ANGRY is essentially one long chase scene which occasionally detours into Shootemupville and Boobytown. Amber Heard instantly makes an impression, with her hot bod and take-no-guff-from-anyone attitude. Nicolas Cage plays it cool but detached which is de rigueur for Cage when starring in most of his action flicks. But a Nick Cage who's sold out is still pretty watchable. No one else can quite be as indifferently cool. DRIVE ANGRY wrests four stars out of five from me, based some on Cage's effort, some on Fichtner's attention grabbing performance, and on Amber Heard's fight, and on the film's excesses and nutty attitude and sheer chutzpah. This is a fun movie. But, then again, I'm the kinda guy who'd rather watch DRIVE ANGRY over LEAVING LAS VEGAS any day, any time. DRIVE ANGRY doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is: a slice of awesome supernatural action-packed B-movie shlock with nice bits of nudity.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff: Audio Commentary by director/co-writer Patrick Lussier and co-writer Todd Farmer; \\"How to: DRIVE ANGRY\\" - the Making Of the Film (00:18:16 minutes long); \\"Milton's Mayhem\\" - as we revisit scenes featuring Milton inflicting bodily damage on various scumbags, a score board appears onscreen which grades his acts of violence (there may also be style points alloted) (00:09:27 minutes); and 2 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:01:33 minutes).mewhere, Quentin Tarantino just stained his pants.

Scan to Evernote.  E-mail to Evernote. Enter notes into Evernote.  Import to Evernote.  It is just too easy to get info into Evernote to not use it.    PC and Android apps are very well done.  Upgrading to PREMIUM is with every  penny.    Forget OneNote.

B003Y5H51K|2.0|This movie had potential, but it eventually flopped. The dialog was terrible, as well as the acting. Some of the scenery was outstanding, but not worth boring yourself for two hours. Sorry James, this one was a loser...
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I will say that I love this for when I am using the on screen keyboard. Prefer it over swype and android keyboard.  Only gripe about on screen is it replacing the larger spacebar with a &quot;.com&quot; button when typing in the browser address bar.  The location of this is terrible.  Now for the part that caused me to uninstall.  I can&apos;t stand the &quot;auto word&quot; pop up when pulling out my hard keyboard.  Creates an annoying flicker effect as I type, and even worse is it&apos;s remapped my &quot;t&quot; key to &quot;=&quot;.  Not much point in using it if I can&apos;t use the letter T.  No option to turn off this hard keyboard integration which sucks hard.  I unchecked the hardware autocorrect optio which seems to do nothing.  If I could just use the on screen keyboard portion of the app I would give it 4 stars, 5 if the get rid of the &quot;.com&quot; button.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Got this application from the android market and had a problem once my Droid x updated a while back. They responded with multiple emails and had the problem fixed in no time.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Great app. Really fun and addicting but it needs to be updated soon. The iPhone app is a tad better...
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is a great 3D mouse.  I have never used one before, but within a day of use it was second nature.  I highly recommend this product.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is the best alarm clock application i&apos;ve ever used the math questions genius!!!  defiantly beats out the stock alarm clocks and store bought alarm clocks :)
1451629184|5.0|I ordered this book 2 days ago and I just received it today! The same day I received the email that it had been shipped!    I am only a few chapters into her story and... Jaycee Dugard is an amazing woman. How she survived is incredible, much more that she walks today without harboring anger or bitterness in her heart! I wish her all the happiness and companionship that she could handle.
0307474712|2.0|I enjoyed most of the book, but was so unbelievably disappointed with the ending... I will not spoil it for other readers, but, in my opinion, it really could/should have ended differently. Because of the ending, it felt like a waste of my time. :0(
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I was unsure about this game at first, but it quickly grew on me. great tower defense game with many levels and levels of difficulty \n
B004R10AQW|5.0|George R. R. Martin did it again with Storm of Swords and it is truly amazing everything that he has done in this series.  If you enjoyed the first two books in the series, then you owe it to yourself to buy this book.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|This is really a B-movie, but it has A-grade production and actors... really big actors like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. If I was to rate this as a B-Movie, I'd give it 5-stars. It has the typical sci-fi weirdness and strange, sometimes random, plot elements you would expect to see in a B-movie. However, the heavily-invested production and actors do nothing more than take away the B-Movie cheapness in the visuals and acting. It still has that weird \\"cult classic\\" feel that appeals to a niche rather than a mainstream audience. All in all, it was disappointing. It lacks that mainstream appeal that an A-movie should have.    If you're an avid B-movie viewer, you might like this A LOT. Otherwise, you may feel lukewarm about seeing it twice.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd - Pulse, is an energized and invigorating live filming of the kings of experimental and progressive rock.<br />In comparison, Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii includes Roger Walters with the band, but the musicians seem bored with each other and the music is a little lackluster. On the other hand, Pulse lacks Waters, but his replacement is a vibrant musician that plays bass better than Waters, and the rest of the band is energetic, excited and passionate on stage. The facial interaction between the musicians lets you know these people are having fun and happy to be on stage, and original member Nick Mason and Richard Wright seem like they are 20 years younger.<br />The first disk of the two disk set contains more of the bands experiment ballads. The second disk has more of the band's hit. Both sets are a joy and performed with signature Pink Floyd gigantic stage, amazing lighting and special effects. You won't get a flying pig with Pulse, but you will get a charging wild boar, a mesmerizing blooming mirror flower, a plane that flies over the audience and crashes in flames, and stunning 5.1 surround sound of one of the best live recordings of Pink Floyd.
0553386794|5.0|Up all night. Couldn't put this one down. Found myself 'cheating' by skipping ahead until Arya's next passage, or Jon's. Then, I'd head back and read what I'd passed over. Characters well fleshed out, each with their own 'voice'. A page turner to the end. Don't want to give anything away for those that haven't read this yet. Book MUCH better than HBO series. So much more offered than what was presented on screen.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app to wake me up everyday.  I love how you can customize it to play different wakeup music.  And program different daily wakeup times(work day, Saturday, Sunday) just great....thanks
0446691437|5.0|Actually, the hardest part of the creative process isn't really about doing something, rather it's about doing nothing. And while this book seems to be written largely for creative people, it pertains to everyone, for its real message is helping anyone who happens upon it to discover their obligation - to themselves, and to the world, to reach their full potential.<br /><br />Easy to read, thought-provoking, and organized so you can pick it up and put it down between reads (I couldn't put it down)this book is filled with uplifting, affirming and sometimes surprising tidbits that help readers identify that mysterious force that seems to hold them back from doing what they most want, as well as the consequences of not nurturing the spirit.
B004GYY714|5.0|great app to have. I am loving it. I can listen the radio stations around the world. nice and easy.
0307346617|5.0|I'm more of a fan of nonfiction, than zombie fiction, but I loved this book.  Very entertaining, very detailed.  Just great
1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes picks up right where City of Bones leaves off.  Clary's world has been turned upside down, and things aren't looking like they are going to change anytime soon. Her mother is in a comma, her best friend is in love with her and the boy who has saved her life endless times is her brother.    In City of Ashes, Clary has a chance to learn more about whom she is and the powers she has.  Valentine is still on the loose and killing all around the city. Jace is faced with the Insquitor who is holding a grudge against Jace for things his father has done.     City of Ashes is a wild ride where Clary and Jace must face their father and their feelings for each other. It's a wonderful second book; I though, better than the second and well worth the read! Can't wait to get into the third.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Although initially difficult to install properly, the word prediction is quite good. I like it better than Samsung Swype now, as I was constantly correcting Swype. It is now my primary keyboard and I will probably keep it indefinitely.
B000HT386M|4.0|Though Adam's movie persona has changed a bit, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Click\\". I also didn't expect the serious tones at times that the plot took on. Though not one of his best, still a sold film.
0553801473|2.0|In a Dance of Dragons, George RR Martin manages to butcher the series yet again. I will not give any main plot events a way, but lets say that he has taken the \\"no character is sacred\\" idea and gone on a killing spree with it. The book is fairly slow paced and has the annoying problem of having to many characters. The plot barely goes anywhere because we have to hear events from the perspective of so many characters that I have lost count. This seems to be an odd problem, considering that George RR Martin has a fondness for killing off his characters. Lets be clear, I am fine with killing off some of the main characters to keep to reader constantly guessing what will happen, and ridding the story of the typical \\"the heroes are always safe\\" situation. It adds a useful unpredictability to the series that, though sometimes frustrating, can be a healthy way to progress the plot. This fails miserably however when the author decides to kill off every good character and leaves only the corrupt, unjust, and broken characters left to manage the story. It is true that the world George RR Martin created could be interesting enough without really needed any central characters, however; I for one need a book to have at least a few characters which I enjoy reading about, regardless of how well structured the world is. Who cares how good the world building is if there are no interesting characters to populate it? It's possible the next book will bring back some characters (though I don't know how that's possible), but I won't ever find out because I'm done reading this series. This book was a huge disappointment and I have learned a valuable lesson to never trust in a series where the author gains some preserve enjoyment from killing off characters.
B004SBX112|1.0|after the new update it closes the app when i click on the summer picnic level. so upsetting!  this is my favorite game but somethibg happened with the last update.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I really like this game. I&apos;m not sure I would&apos;ve tried it if it hadn&apos;t been a free app of the day, so I&apos;m glad it was. Knowing what I know now, I would say it&apos;s worth the $2.00. It&apos;s just challenging enough that you have to put somer thought into it, but it&apos;s not so hard that you get frustrated. The suspense kills me. Sometimes I&apos;m right at the end of a level and I lose so I have to reorganize my strategy. Keeps me thinking. I&apos;m obsessed.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Ive been looking for a book for a while that has everything this one has to offer. After reading ive been looking for a similar one but no others have compared. It was almost impossible to put down and really left me wanting more. I convinced a few of my friends to read it and they all absolutely loved it. Cannot recommend this book enough.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Planet of the Apes is one of those franchises I never really saw the appeal in. The original one is the only one that seems to get continuous praise from people, but it along with its four sequels have been labeled as dated more than anything else. Then there was the Tim Burton remake from 2001 that nearly everyone says is terrible. It's usually referred to as \\"the one with Marky Mark\\" and I overheard a conversation a row ahead of me earlier tonight where somebody said, \\"I couldn't even finish it.\\" So I was essentially entering Rise of the Planet of the Apes with a fresh mind; seeing it as a standalone film rather than a reboot of a franchise. To be honest though, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is excellent no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />The compelling story is what really makes the movie. It makes you feel sympathy for these apes in ways you probably can't even fathom when you're first sitting down to see it. The relationship between Caesar (Andy Serkis) and Will Rodman (James Franco) is the heart and soul of the movie. Caesar's facial expressions and actions just immediately make your chest tighten and heart beat in ways to let you know you're seeing something special. If Andy Serkis is involved in any way when it comes to motion capture technology being used in an upcoming movie expect magic because that's what you're going to receive. You feel more for Caesar than anyone else in the movie and you should. It is a movie about apes taking over the world after all.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a smart movie; plain and simple. There's a lot of scientific jargon thrown in there and whether it's all legitimate or not it all comes together in a way that makes sense. It's story structure is brilliant, as well. It starts off a little slow and shows how Caesar becomes a part of Will's life while also showing the struggle Will's father Charles (John Lithgow) is going through with a case of Alzheimer's that's quickly making his health deteriorate. Will works for the Gen-Sys lab, which develops antidotes that they test on primates with hopes of it curing human disease. ALZ 112 is what they hope will cure Alzheimer's, but it backfires. It has an alternative effect on humans than it does on apes; humans tend to get sick and die while it makes apes more intelligent. As the years pass, Caesar and Will become close but they're separated after Will is forced to put Caesar in a primate reserve. As Will focuses on trying to save his father's life and bring Caesar back home, Caesar begins planning a revolution and starts to relate to his brethren.<br /><br />There are a few references to the original Planet of the Apes films. Since I haven't seen them, I was really only able to catch a few of them. The cool thing about them though is that they can be looked at as planted seeds for potential sequels or just as a throwback to where the movie originated from. That's something special in itself; a movie able to accomplish something open-ended.<br /><br />The cast is pretty fantastic, as well. James Franco has always been an actor with the potential to deliver a great performance and he does so here. John Lithgow was a pleasant surprise as I wasn't aware he was a part of the cast until I saw him on-screen. The way he handles Alzheimer's is really incredible. Andy Serkis, as already mentioned, is the guy that makes the whole thing come together; Caesar is just amazing. Brian Cox makes a brief appearance as a rather low-life individual and Tom Felton plays his son who's a lot like Draco Malfoy in personality. Tyler Labine takes a break from comedy to show he's not too bad at drama while David Oyelowo shows how you can be despicable while just trying to do what's best for the company you work for. The strong cast is just as impressive as the fascinating storyline.<br /><br />This is the first Planet of the Apes movie to use CGI effects rather than actors in prosthetic makeup. You may be asking yourself how that's going to look.Don't put much thought into it; it looks outstanding. Weta Digital really outdid themselves with this movie. Everything blends together so well that the apes look genuinely realistic the entire time. Their emotions are portrayed to perfection, which is probably the most important aspect of this movie. I'm a pretty big stickler when it comes to the more exciting sequences in modern films being littered with noticeable CGI creatures in front of a green screen. That sort of thing is so minimal that I honestly can't remember having that feeling during Rise of the Planet of the Apes. So not only do you get great action, you get seamless special effects as well.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes is ridiculously good on all fronts. It features an excellent cast, an absorbing storyline, explosive action, and marvelous special effects. This is easily one of the best films of the year.

1594481717|1.0|Wow, things sure sound great in Pink's extravagantly affluent utopia of right brainers! Can I come and play, too?    I read that he hails from Northern Virginia someplace...sounds like he's one of those Beltway Bandits sucking at the U.S. Federal Government teat?? I see from the copyright date that this magazine article-cum-\\"book\\" was authored during the height of those no-bid contracts doled out to the Bush-Cheney lackeys pushing their \\"war\\" in Iraq. One good fantasy deserves another, as evidenced in this \\"book\\".    I think this Mr. Pink should take a short 4-hour drive down here to Norfolk Virginia and see what it's like to have to survive in the Real World.
0553801473|2.0|I want to like it. I want to finish it. This book is so heavy, I think I will finally be forced to buy an e-reader. I feel bored and lethargic when I read this. Oh, what happened to this awesome series? Nothing else to be said!
B004VMVTNU|2.0|Not to sure why an ALARM clock would need GPS so it can track when your at work or school umm it would be set to when I need to get up and if it went off while I was at work then the alarm is not working so it has a mind. And sorry my phone has an alarm that works perfect no need to get another. \n\n\nBTW 5 stars wow for a alarm clock.....hmmm.....!!!
0470876417|5.0|- sehr gut strukturiert  - verständlich geschrieben  - enthält wertvolle, praxisnahe Hilfsmittel  - ergänzt mit ausgezeichnete Visualisierungen
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is a great alarm clock app with some nice features. this and gentle alarm each have some good features that the other doesn&apos;t have so I&apos;ll keep them both.  also to the guy who gave a 3 star review because &quot;this app has been offered before,&quot; it hasn&apos;t. it&apos;s probably gentle alarm that you&apos;re thinking of... and you shouldn&apos;t be rating a perfectly good app poorly because Amazon gave you something for free that you didn&apos;t like. beggars can&apos;t be choosers
B004VMVTNU|1.0|I installed this app thinking it would be a great way to wake me up, but then it starting resetting my ringer volume to the lowest possible. I thought maybe it was my phone so i uninstalled the application and my ringer volume was fine. never installing this again. I missed my alarm and i didn&apos;t hear calls or txts. it was because of this application
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou Harris has tried plenty of different sounds by now. She has written and covered some amazing songs that became successes in their own right. And everything she had learned and done for her four decade career had been building up to this album.     This may not be the pure country sounds that made her famous, but it's the same perfect voice, emotions, and song writing/selecting technique that has been winning her fans for her entire career.     There is no big production on the aptly titled All I Intended to Be. It is not a showy album. It is a simple and honest look at Harris' past few years and her life and loves. It deals with love, loss, death, and stories of the heroes she grew up with. This instrumentals are dead on, her voice is perfectly fitting to all of the songs, and her lyrics hit home more than ever before.     As always, this is a complete album and not just a collection of songs. Everything ties together beautifully and makes for the kind of album you can listen to all the way through, over and over again.     This may be the album that defines Harris for this decade. And that gives me hope for things to come from Harris.
B001NKI60W|1.0|The 80s died for a reason. They should stay dead. This revival? SLIGHTLY less horrifying than the Yellow Submarine. The main character was a manipulative, wishy-washy bitch (and why was and Streep the only ones with an American accent?) The plot... who am I kidding? WHAT plot? At least MOST musicals make SOME sort of cohesive sense! I'm not entirely certain WHY I watched the entire thing, other than it was the soul-destroying train-wreck that, once you start watching, you have to finish.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|OK let's get the obvious out of the way - Jon Anderson is missing and it's noticeable.  How could it not be?  Jon's mystical lyricism, long a pillar of the Yes sound, is nowhere to be found.  The discussion of whether it was right or wrong to not include Jon is outside this review.      Benoit David is a good vocalist, a hybrid of Jon and Trevor Horn (more the latter).  What would have been interesting is if Yes did the Journey thing and released this new disc with a disc of re-recorded greatest hits, so fans could hear how much Benoit David does/does not sound like Jon singing the Yes catalog.  His performance here is more than listenable / serviceable / acceptable; it's good - not great, but certainly not terrible.  Geoff Downes keyboards are more in a Yes mode and not the shrill synthetic horn sound that characterizes his Asia work.  Chris and Alan sounds, at parts, like the Yes you know and love - playing aggressively and in odd time signatures and rhythms; really attacking the songs.  Steve Howe is all over the album with two good acoustic submissions and his signature figures and embellishments with his electric on the remainder.  I think this album is better than 90125, Big Generator, and even Tormato.  It reminds me of Drama in sound and production; Relayer for the \\"side 1\\" suite, Tormato for Chris and Alan's playing, and Fragile (though sadly no Roundabout or Heart of the Sunrise) for the random mixture of the side 2 songs.      The DVD documentary is very  good - about 30 minutes of in studio interviews and sound bites from the making of the album.  If you are a fan of Yes, you will enjoy this deluxe edition.  A solid 4 stars.
B0052WKZZ6|4.0|I write this on August 4, 2011. As of today, this is the only review of the Deluxe Edition of this CD on the Amazon USA site. I received my copy from Amazon.co.uk. Before you purchase this CD you should go there ([...]) and check out the reviews on that site. They give reviews of this CD set and all of them, both the good and bad, are, in my opinion, accurate. The important thing to know is that there is a glitch on track 4 that is just a blip, but very annoying nonetheless. The company that made the CD have indicated that they are pressing a replacement that they will provide for free, but they give no timetable as to when it will occur. (Update: Received replacement disk on August 16th. Kudos to Universal!)    The reviews on the UK  site really say it all with regard to the quality of this CD set and the music thereon, so I will say no more.  If you choose to purchase the CD set from the UK please note that my experience with them was very positive. You use your credit card and it automatically converts to USA dollars. The cost for the CD was about $20 including postage. I received the CD 7 days after it shipped.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Well the title says it all. Yes it is an alarm clock.  How many customization's do you need.  I use the alarm clock that came with my phone and guess what.....it wakes me up!! If it is free then great, if not I don't know if I would pay for it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have happily reread Martin's first four books in preparation for the fifth.  I have read and reread the first three numerable times, and loved them always.  This is only my first time rereading A FEAST FOR CROWS, and I am really amazed at how much I enjoyed it.  My first read?  Ugh.  Slow.  My favorite characters were missing.  Too much subtext and background.  But, reading this on the heals of STORM OF SWORDS, I can only say this is quite a solid entry in the series.  Yep, we learn of the reprecussions of life after the Red Wedding, the death of Joffrey, and the destruction of the river lands.  Crows do, indeed, feast.  But so too does evil, vengeance, and decency.  Some of our favorite characters shine:  Jaimie is well developed.  Cersei and her weight gain are but part of the traumas that strike our regal B*tch.  A much better read than I remembered.  Something to savor, even at its slowest moments.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|Decent app, but gentle alarm is better. Highly recommend gentle alarm over this. It also has the ability to set snooze options and math problems.  Only benefit this app has over gentle alarm is that it takes up much less space. Gentle alarm works just g fine when moved to the sd card however unlike this app.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Nice exciting documentary of the man who tightrope walked across the World Trade Center as it was still being built.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings back memories of people doing daring things and the World Trade Center itself.  Wonderful story.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|The only two movies I liked with Clooney include the Three Kings and Burn After Reading.  I like this one too.  I didn't see any of the trailers for The American, and I supposed had I done so, perhaps there would have been a slight let down but not much. I can't agree with the negative reviewers who say that Clooney's character doesn't break a sweat under fire nor doesn't display emotion.  The scene in the restaurant with the other assasin for example, Clooney's charater clearly shows in his face that he's fighting his instinct to panic.  That panic is vividly apparent and not totally unde control.  There are unanswered questions for why he is being hunted and it's this part that doesn't make sense to me.  He's not the head of an organization nor is he on an assignment which would put him at risk---yet, people are actively after him from one side of Europe to another.  Regarding the disbeliefs:  Can someone put a rifle together from mail order parts? Certainly can.  Can a silencer be made from shop parts.  Certainly can.  Can someone pick up a downed Vespa and ride it with precision over cobblestones in a tight alley and down steps and chase down a car?.. Well, here's where I draw the line.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|A lot of the disks don't play. Super cheap quality and missing the poster advertised on the box as well as the episode list. I'm on the second set and I'm going to return it again. Shameful.
B005DD7H50|5.0|great movie very easy to watch and enjoy, its a captivating story and lesson anout drug harmful effects on the body, definitely a must see movie!
B0057KXXFM|1.0|This album is as good as the cover... which, I suppose should be noted - is a joke.  Durst's ship has sailed (maybe that's it in the background of the cover?). It's time to throw in the towel LB. The frat-boy hardcore was a gimmick. you had it in the 90's, and ya lost it. We've all dusted off our baseball caps, and moved on.    Save your money. If you want to part with $10, feed an African village, help out with some relief aid - buy a friend a sammich. This ain't it.  Can't even say I'd rock this if it were free. I'd probably even be embarrassed to in public.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using the free version of this alarm clock for over 3 months and it&apos;s always gotten me up. I wake up at 4:30am (sometimes I don&apos;t get to bed until 12am) and the alarm works without fail due to all the features included. I also use the nap timer feature all the time. Now it&apos;s free! This is a must grab for anyone on a schedule.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|does what i need. with style. the gps feature lets you auto disable alarms when moving\/driving.  easy to edit on the fly.
0984334904|5.0|While I am very dedicated to learning japanese, I am also very cheap. So when I looked at the price of these cards I was anxious to find a reason to not purchase them.  I did an overwhelming amount of research and even tried to make some of my own. I came to the conclusion that if I really wanted to pass the JLPT then I would HAVE to give these a try and I am happy to say that I have no regrets.   These cards are excellent for all study styles. They are great study aides for a class and they are excellent for independent study as well (my preference).    Its hard to believe how much information they were able to pack onto these cards. While the on-yomi and kun-yomi readings are very helpful, the vocabulary really takes the cake. The words chosen are useful, every day words and the many that have been marked with a star (*) have been used on the JLPT so one knows that that word is worth memorization. So far I have found no book with such comprehensive lists of vocabulary. And the more important aspect is that the vocabulary is presented in an easy to learn style. Instead of trying to imitate latin based teaching methods, it presents the vocabulary with its kanji, pronunciation and its sister words. I find its a lot easier to learn kanji in the context of words and these cards exploit that, giving you a lot of example words to come back to.    The stroke order and \\"similar kanji\\" is also very helpful for a student who isn't so visual.     Overall, each of the cards is extremely thorough and jammed packed with useful information. The cards themselves are sturdy and water resistant, so it's easy to pack some in your purse or wallet and just pull them out when you have some free time. These are indispensable study aides for anyone who is serious about learning Japanese.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|great app, especially for those who lost their alarm clock on their HTC Droid Inc 2. I have used this regularly and it is simple, reliable, and effective.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|You move you fish around by touching the screen where you want the fish to go. Problem is that you can&apos;t see the screen because your finger is in the way. Since the fish needs to be almost constantly moving the game is hampered by poor controls.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I downloaded this game based off the reviews and must say it totally lives up to it&apos;s rating (at this time 5\/5). if you loved the old final fantasy games (nintendo Gen) then you should add this game to your collection.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is amazing for that all of the people on amazon that give bad reviews this one has literally almost nothing but 5 stars from almost everyone. Should be considered one of the all-time best android apps. Dev is awesome.
0547258305|4.0|*Possible spoiler alert* I read Graceling because it was a recommended read for people who loved The Hunger Games.  I would agree that if you liked the hunger games you just might like this book (unless you don't like science fiction beyond what you read in the hunger games, this book has many of those aspects; made up locations, people with powers, cities dangling from Cliffs) .  I thought the plot was very creative. Some parts moved a bit slower than others. I found the explanation of the 7 kingdoms to be a little confusing, even though I grasped what the author was trying to do (give us the back drop) I wish it had been incorporated a little bit more cohesively (not all on one page with all the names listed out). I also found some parts a bit slow, I would find myself skim reading a paragraph or two to get to the point.  There's been a lot of hoopla about a sex scene on here and I must admit that once I got to it I didn't think it over the top and would let my teenage son or daughter read it. I was somewhat disappointed with how the book ended.  I felt that the relationship with Po and Katsa was not really resolved. Here they have this great love for each other and yet they are going to go separate ways for the sake of her keeping this sense self-identity or so as not be owned/ ruled by any one... \\"I guess I'll see you in October\\" was not a very satisfying way to end things when a few pages earlier Katsa could hardly breathe with the thought of Po being dead... It was a bit anti marriage and even though I got over this I didn't see why two people who loved each other couldn't do things together or meet in the middle and compromise or why it meant she had to give up her individual-ness or why it would mean he owned her... I didn't worry about it because I thought this would be resolved in the sequel \\"fire\\" but upon starting it last night I realized it's not a sequel at all but a story with a whole new set of characters! I guess I'll just have to imagine up my own ending for  Katsa and Po, but there is definitely a lot more that could be said and done with these two! I hope she writes more about them!ending for  Katsa and Po, but there is definitely a lot more that could be said and done with these two! I hope she writes more about them!
B005FJ7DOM|2.0|This movie offers us absolutely nothing new in a dangerously stale genre, and it's really a zombie movie masquerading as (far as I could tell) as a vampire movie, FYI.  It's like Zombieland with less memorable performances and absolutely zero comic relief (which is to say, none of the former movie's charm).      Unless you're simply downright desperate or like pretty much anything, don't waste the time and money.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I just received a Kindle last week for my birthday and today I purchased my first bestseller book \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" after having read the sample and a few free and $0.99 books.  To my dismay this Kindle Edition is full of Popular Highlights that CAN'T be turned off.  Yes, in my \\"settings\\" I do have Popular Highlights turned off, but it doesn't truly work.  Highlights are still displayed and the number of readers that have highlighted that passage is also displayed.  You can turn off the number of people that have highlighted the content by pressing the bent arrow key as instructed at the bottom of your Kindle Screen but you can't not remove the underscoring that remains.  I searched Customer Support Forums only to find no solution so I then contacted customer service who then told me it was a feature of the book and was listed in the product features.  The book was returned and I then searched the product features to find out that customer service lied.  Now I'm seriously considering returning my Kindle because the highlighted passages are the equivalent of a used book and I don't care for other people's unsolicited highlighted passages.  So buyer beware of unwanted material when buying these Kindle Editions.  If the majority of Kindle books are this full of nusances then I will be returning my Kindle.  I'm glad I bought it at Best Buy and have that option.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|I was about to lose my job at Angel Labs and then my wife's love. My boss said, \\"If you don't get up really early and give our app 5 stars tomorrow morning, then you're fired!\\" That's when I downloaded this incredible app. I woke up this morning, gave it 5 stars and now I got a raise from my boss and a promotion from my wife.  This App:  *Has an easy to use interface.  *Adds 1 or 2 features the your phones on board alarms doesn't have.  *Comes from a company with a really cool boss!  *Is good!!!11!    This App is worth 3x the amount of it's current app store value!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have used this app for some time (the free version) and it has a few features that stand out. Max amount of snoozes, Math problems with 5 difficulty settings and a choice of how many are solved before able to hit snooze. There are also customizable ways to deal with snooze. You can shake the phone and/or disable onscreen buttons so that you must use the physical buttons. Also, alarms can go off during a call meaning you won't miss the alarm. You can choose between vibrate or quiet in-call versions or none at all. Also, if you don't want to waste battery and your alarm is one that only needs to go off as a reminder, you can set durations for the alarm. You can also choose the numbers of times a snooze can be hit before it won't work any longer. I have been using the free edition for quite some time. This is an awesome app and I have not used the stock version since starting with this one. Great Job and well thought out.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book, although I only bought it to support this lovely brave young woman.  This book represents the very pinnacle of courage.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  I loved this book for many reasons; firstly because of Jaycee's voice. I am so very glad that was not edited out.  Her childlike way of writing, is so purely experiential that you know instantly you are hearing her speak from her own mind and heart.  It' like reading a little girl's diary.  And the only way you could ever come alongside her to begin to fathom how she survived.  The fact that she tells us what happened to her is amazing; the fact that she tells us in order to inspire others is saintly.  I hope this book was helpful for her and her family, because when you read the book you will want to help by spiritually being there and holding her hand as she goes through her ordeal.  And that is what this book does. It is not as if we are being gorey or lacivious.  We are there with her, to walk along side and share courage with her.  I love to read biographies: this is not just that.  It is a dreamlike walk through terror endured by an innocent. What we learn is that we can survive anything we survive, and not be ruined.   And, we learn that the key piece of equipment Jaycee lacked prior to her abduction, a voice for herself, finally emerges when she is reunited with her wonderful Mom.  I learned to love these two women.  This book was a great tribute to all Survivors.  I am so very happy that Jaycee trusts us enough to share her experiences with us.
1423101502|5.0|As this eagerly anticipated conclusion to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series opens, Percy is returning to camp to prepare to join in the already raging battle between the Titans and the Gods.  He finally gets to hear the full prophecy that has been hanging over his life the past few years, which proves far from reassuring.  Percy will need to make tough decisions and take risky moves in the attempt to beat Kronos and his army, as well as learn who he can really trust and who he cannot, as the lines between good and evil are not as black and white as he always assumed.    This is a fantastic novel; the reader is taken right into the action without too much background from the previous novels (which can be a downfall in many series).  The characters continue to develop and mature, especially during this serious war which sees them lose friends and allies.  The mythology themes also continue including one of the most memorable scenes in the novel with a Patroclus leading the Myrmidon reenactment that was intense and shocking, much as the original must have been!    This whole series is highly recommended for all ages.  A great way to get kids interested in Greek mythology, a way to spend family time together reading, and a fun adventure for adults as well.

1591843790|5.0|This book was written by the fellow with the responsibility of marketing the Apple Macintosh.  He is straightforward in his writing style making it easy to read and understand the points being made.  The stories are engaging and easily made the points the author attempted.        The book provides a set of basic actions that help people create enchantment.  Enchanting people are those individuals that we are drawn to - people that are easily liked; those that we readily follow; those that have generated in us a desire to spend more time with them.  The skills that are used by these people can be learned by others and the author lays these out for his readers to learn.    I enjoyed the book and the way the topics are presented.  Some of this is basic but the spotlight pointed on these skills is a great reminder for what we can do to deliver the extra special item that changes a valued contribution into an enchanting contribution.
0553801473|3.0|By now you've probably read all of the lukewarm reviews of \\"Dance with Dragons.\\"<br /><br />This is yet another. But I think I know what's going on.<br /><br />GRRM needs two very important things to happen before he can move the story forward. Both of these things take time.<br /><br />First, he needs for winter to come. All of the dangers hinted at beyond the wall only stir in the dead of winter.<br /><br />Second, and most importantly, he needs Dany's dragons to grow up. She can't very well march into Westeros with three dragons the size of ponies.<br /><br />Both of these things have happened by the end of \\"Dance with Dragons.\\" And not much else.<br /><br />Looked at this way the entirety of \\"Dance with Dragons\\" could be summed up with the words \\"Eighteen Months Later...\\" Aside from that GRRM has given us maybe 300 pages of story wrapped up 1000 pages of book.<br /><br />So, I would rate \\"Dance with Dragons\\" as completely \\"skipable.\\" It's okay, but don't expect much to happen. We really are just waiting for time to pass.<br /><br />That said, the chapters with Tyrion were a little troubling. Without much story our favorite halfman was left wandering around getting into pointless adventures and making wisecracks. GRRM would honestly, truly done everyone a favor (Tyrion especially) by just leaving these chapters out altogether.<br /><br />Finally, I'm glad I read \\"Dance.\\" I'm a huge fan of GRRM and the series.<br /><br />But, in the end, it's the weather and the dragons that are the stars of this book.<br /><br />If you set your expectations accordingly it's worth a read.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Movies like \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\", \\"Yogi Bear\\", \\"Hop\\" and this one here definitely devide viewers into two different factions. Either you love them or loath them and it won't be different with this one. A majority of critics seem to hate this kind of movie for it is brainless, dumbed-down entertainment for kids and geeks, nothing more, nothing less.   Don't expect a cerebral piece of art in the vain of the better Pixar movies. If you're okay with slapstick jokes, colorfully smurfed language and blue cuteness for cuteness' sake than this movie is for you. If you couldn't stand \\"Alvin\\" and its squeakquel, if you hated \\"Hop\\" and \\"Yogi Bear\\" and if you expect a \\"faithful\\" adaptation of an old cartoon, avoid this one like plague.   This is from the director who gave us both \\"Scooby Doo\\" life-action flicks, so no, this one's not Pixar or even \\"Shrek\\", it is NOT all-age animation art, it simply is a straight-forward kiddie flick that adults may be able to enjoy if they cultivate their inner child and aren't afraid of switching off their brains in favor of mindless escapist fun.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Surfer will give any age viewer an honest look of youth at its best. Bethany Hamilton's story of loosing her arm while surfing was world news, then a book, and now done in film form. It's an amazing story of one girl, her family, her friends, her church, and what can be accomplished not only through recovery but a continuing life of giving others an outlook of HOPE. She is one remarkable girl, a must-see film. The DVDs has a warning about the intense accident scene but it is actually not that bad. Of course there are lots of heavenly panoramas since the film is shot in Hawaii.<br /><br />Regardless of faith preference, Bethany has to give others with similar struggles a leap in optimism. For those who have been fortunate to never before dealt with a life/death episode; this can give you a taste of what it is like. This child looked to her faith. It was my nephew who encouraged my wife and I to get this DVD to view.<br /><br />There are those who oppose the Christian dialogue and direction that the family of Bethany, and she herself take. But that IS the truth of this Christian family. If anything it is downplayed, but not much, as the Bethany and her family was adamant that viewers hear the true story of how and why they feel Bethany survived. Bethany becomes a champion pro-surfer, with only one arm; the film and in real life. Plenty of big names acting in this film such as Dennis Quaid as Dad; Helen Hunt as Mom, AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany and seems almost a double to the real surfer. Singer Carrie Underwood has a non-singing role.<br /><br />SUBTITLES available in English, Spanish & French.

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|A business book written buy guys who have actually done what they are writing about!!    I don't usually write reviews for the books I read, but this one inspired me from page one to the end and I felt this is the least I could do.    I have been an on again and off again user of 37Signals products for years based on where I was working and from day 1 I have always loved their product and after reading this book I know why.    Their ideas are so simple yet so powerful. I love the ideas that it is not about how big or how much but more about how good. Essentially going against everything that American business seems to stand for.    As a self proclaimed starter who is currently working through the first year of a new business that resembles a lot of how 37Signals built themselves this book is now my roadmap for the future. I already ordered the Kindle version so I can carry a copy of it wherever I go.    On top of that I ordered it for all the other guys on the team to get them pumped up as we head towards the finish line.    Great job guys!!!
0553801473|1.0|I have been a fan of this series since its earliest days but this book is so bad, it confirms the widespread view that George has lost the plot completely.<br />Almost 1000 pages AND NOTHING HAPPENS. Tyrion Lannister becomes a freak riding a pig, Daenerys disappears two thirds of the way through on a dragon (the only time a dragon features) after drifting around Meereen acting like a love lorn school girl. Jon Snow looks over the wall - interminably. Bran turns into a tree. Jamie and Cercie Lannister drift in and out. Stannis, the Freys and the Boltons get lost in the snow. Making this trio boring is some achievement.<br />That's about it. No progress in the plot, the odd vacuous new character and pages and pages and pages of vague rambling and tedious debates between characters that would make Hamlet seem decisive.<br />Could have been written as a short story - and still been to long.<br />Come on George, finish it off and put us out of our misery.

I especially enjoyed hearing about her experiences playing the role of a certain political figure on Saturday Night Live, which she thoroughly details in the book.  I love that Tina comes off as a confident woman who never wasted her time trying to fit in.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a regular exerciser but was derailed with a severe knee injury this winter.  After 6 months of NO exercise and a still somewhat wonky knee I had hit rock bottom.  I'm 25lbs overweight and had zero endurance.  I bought this video because 1) It's Jillian, 2) the reviews here were GREAT, 3) I needed something short to reverse my momentum and get moving again.    I tend to try to do HUGE daily workouts (1-2 hours) and it just wasn't working.  So I set the goal to just work this 20 minute routine into my morning wake up routine.  20 minutes is just to convenient to make excuses about.    The first time I did the Level 1 video I thought I was going to throw up.  My ears started ringing (seriously) and I had to take a minute to get ahold of myself.  I can't believe how much it kicked my butt.  My knee also was VERY unhappy about a lot of the bouncing cardio.    BUT... I came back to it the next day and it was awesome.  I still couldn't complete every rep of every move but I saw improvement.      Having done triathlons and classes and being a \\"work out\\" kind of girl I knew right off the bat that this workout was doing something amazing. I will stick with this video because for 20 minutes the return will be amazing.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|1968's \\"Planet of the Apes\\" was a bold piece of science fiction, scripted with characteristic intelligence by Rod Serling, the creator of \\"The Twilight Zone\\".  It spawned four sequels (despite star Charlton Heston's attempt to kill the franchise with the ending of the second film), generally held to be of declining quality, and various other spinoffs; Tim Burton previously attempted to reboot the series in 2001 with a film starring Mark Wahlberg and Tim Roth, but that was poorly received.  Now, a decade later, Hollywood has another go, helmed by newcomer Rupert Wyatt and scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver.  To be honest, given the relatively unknown creative team and the seeming gratuitousness of the project, I initially wrote this off as a cheap cash grab.  To my surprise, however, the result is a smart and interesting film that ranks as one of the summer's better movies, supported by phenomenal special affects a great lead performance by Andy Serkis.  Spoilers follow.    This seems to be a reboot (though I've seen suggestions that this fits reasonably well with the background suggested by the original film; but the first film series could never get its continuity straight anyway), with the first film's Cold War fears of nuclear Armageddon replaced by the most potent fears of the 21st:  genetic engineering and global pandemics.  But that's getting ahead of ourselves.  We follow Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco, who's competent but not at his best here), an Alzheimers researcher who plans to use gene therapy to allow the human brain to develop new cells, and tests it first on chimps.  The result is Caesar (created by Andy Serkis and WETA's CGI magicians), an extremely intelligent ape capable  of communication with humans and with cognitive skills far exceeding a human at the same age.  Will hopes to use the therapy to cure his father (John Lithgow, affecting with comparatively little screentime), while his boss Jacobs (British actor David Oyelowo, in a rather thankless part) sees the potential for huge profits.  However, when an incident leads to Caesar being confined to an ape sanctuary, his ties to humanity rupture, thanks in great part to the abusive handler (Tom Felton, basically doing his Draco Malfoy dragon-tickling schtick with an American accent).    It has become common to say that Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" depicts the computer HAL as more human than the actual human characters, an opinion I don't necessarily agree with, but a comparable effect is in evidence here:  Caesar is by far the best-realized character, a tremendous technical achievement that moviemakers twenty years ago could only dream of.  James Franco, in the human lead part, is uninspired.  Lithgow is the most effective member of the human cast, bringing great resonance to the elderly Charles.  \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\"'s Freida Pinto has the utterly thankless part of Will's primatologist girlfriend Caroline, who is barely in the film (in a sequel, hopefully they'll do more with this character), though she looks lovely throughout.  Tom Felton, as the abusive animal handler, accomplishes his primary function:  making the audience eagerly anticipate his comeuppance.  In a film that otherwise tries to be fairly balanced in depicting both the human and ape sides, he's the most obvious villain.  I found the \\"profit motive\\" angle with Oyelowo's character a bit overdone (and, when you examine the actual events of the film, Oyelowo's greed doesn't actually lead to any of the big consequences, all of which result directly from actions taken by James Franco's character).    The film ends on an oddy hopeful note, before a sinister mid-credits scene reveals much more detail on the impending doom of human civilization, something that the new franchise carefully avoids assigning to the apes, in keeping with the attempt not to overtly villainize either side.  There are a number of callbacks included in the movie to the earlier films, including a respectful tip of the hat to the late Charlton Heston.    All in all, this a very strong start for a revived franchise.  We await the box office results to see whether the creative team will have the opportunity to show us more of this future, but I'm certainly game to find out.

B002SM2QDC|4.0|...if u can look past the bad acting and cliche/80s-90s era action movie feel of it, it's actually a pretty entertaining flick. The special effects aren't the greatest during parts of it or nor does the movie give you a traditional G.I. Joe feel but it's watchable. Basically a movie made by Hollywood for the masses and not the original fans.
0670022411|3.0|Scenes reminiscent of Twilight detract from Ms. Harkness story. As if she read the series just before writing her own books and said, \\"Ah, HA! That's an idea.\\"<br /><br />And what a mess of conflicting threads! Does it help the `stud factor' that the tall, dark, and handsome vamp is living with his mommy? Um. No. Kinda kills the buzz, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />After the first hundred pages, my reaction was Get On With It. Shesh. The two `lovers' take turns living with various relatives (another buzz kill) and start smooching then Whoops! Surprise! Interrupted again by servants, aunts, and dear old mum. Over and over and over and...<br /><br />Wait for the paperback or better yet, get it from the library. The sample chapters rock but the storyline quickly mires down into a clay pit of Blech.<br />I wish I had my high-priced Kindle download back.

B004RC8NXI|5.0|Surprisingly heartfelt and moving.  Ashton kutcher and natalie portman are superb.  This may share the same theme as friends with benefits -- but that was done differently and if it was just based on the premise -- no strings attached wins hands down.  It's a great romantic comedy done correctly.
B00507ZQVQ|4.0|Although there is an intimate and tragic love story at its heart, Aida is set against the exotic background of the Egypt of the Pharaohs, and is full of patriotic, nationalistic sentiments, as the Egyptian army prepare to go to war to fight off a revolt by the Ethiopians.  It's a perfect subject, in other words, for Verdi, and it was undoubtedly the nature of the storyline, much more than any commission for the new opera house in Cairo (which he repeatedly refused) or the grand occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal, that encouraged him to return to opera composition in 1871, and he would return in style with a magnificent work.   Considering its origins and its setting - whether it was composed for a grand occasion or not - Verdi's Aida is appropriately stately in its expressions of nationalistic pride and identity, with extravagant marches, battle hymns, ceremonial processions and dances.  There's no point in doing Aida in a minimalist style, as Robert Wilson has done in the past (although it's certainly interesting to see something different attempted) - this is an opera that just calls out for a grand scale production.  If you haven't got a stage the size of the Arena di Verona, and a director like Franco Zeffirelli to fill it, the nearest grand, traditionally staged Aida you are going to find is this Sonja Frisell production - now over twenty years old - for the Metropolitan Opera in New York.  It's a big production in every respect - and yes, I include the size of the singers in this - with towering temples, the stage filled with chorus, troops, dancers and well-tanned, bare-chested slaves, even horses and chariots, all arranged in grand ceremonial processions and formations.  It's unfortunately a little too static - an impressive spectacle even if it is a little bit kitsch, but not much thought has been put into the interaction between the main players.  They just walk on in most cases, sing their part, and walk back off again.  But, this is what you expect of an Aida production - particularly a traditional one at the Met - and really, you'd feel somewhat short-changed if it didn't have all the other bells and whistles (and trumpets).  You won't feel short-changed by the singers here either.  Johan Botha is one of the finest tenors in the world, a great Wagnerian heldentenor, which serves him in good stead for this particular Verdi opera.  I don't know about his acting ability - there's not much required here of Ramadès - but he has an ability to fill his roles with life, principally through the wonderful warmth of tone of his voice. Violeta Urmana is the Verdian soprano of choice at the moment, and she is fine singing the role of Aida, if again there are not any real acting demands placed on her.  Dolora Zajick is an experienced Amneris and sings the role well, but does unfortunately look constipated when singing (sorry, but she does).  The final duet notwithstanding, Act IV of Aida belongs to Amneris however, Verdi giving her character real depth and human passion, and Dolora Zajick launches into it with relish, making perhaps the strongest impression on the whole production, which is a little lacking in energy elsewhere.  Recorded live for worldwide broadcast in 2009 for the Met's Live in HD programme, the production looks fantastic in High Definition, is colourful and well-lit.  The audio mixes are in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and, allowing for one or two minor sound issues with the live mix which is a little bit echoing in places, they both sound fine, the surround in particular dispersing the choral singing well.  Extras on the BD include edited-down interviews (I'd have been happy to listen to much more of this) conducted by Renée Fleming with the cast and extras.

Great horn lines,  kicking beats and bass lines that makes you wanna get up and dance.  Nothing like   the majority of today's over produced no talented music.  Every song sounds  the same today.  These bands worked hard at their music, performed  for years and it was all about the music.  Not becoming a star in 48 hours.  Plus, you can't beat it when both bands play together.  My first band I performed  with when I was 17 on keyboards was playing music of both Chicago and EWF.  Watch the concert, turn up the volume to 11 and enjoy!
0736083863|5.0|NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this book from the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.<br /><br />PILATES ANATOMY is the latest offering from Human Kinetics publishing group.  For this project, Human Kinetics recruited Rael Isacowitz, a prestigious Pilates instructor who was trained by several \\"first generation\\" Pilates teachers (i.e., those who studied directly under Joseph Pilates himself) and Karen Clippinger, M.S.P.E., who has a master's degree in exercise science and has worked for over two decades as a clinical kinesiologist.  As noted in the book's Preface, together, Isacowitz and Clippinger have more than 60 years combined Pilates-related experience.<br /><br />This manual is extremely comprehensive.  Not only does it provide an in depth look at the mechanics involved in Pilates matwork, but also it offers an introduction to the discipline itself.  Furthermore, because the authors recognize that their readers may not be coming from a scientific background, they include a review of basic anatomical concepts.  Chapter 1 opens with the six key principles of Pilates (breath, concentration, center, control, precision, flow), with simple drawings illustrating how the breathing in Pilates takes place.  In Chapter 2, there is a discussion of the spine which involves diagramming the regions of the spine and defining the major movements of the spine.  The muscles of the \\"powerhouse\\" are also presented here, from the abdominals to the spinal extensors to the quadratus and iliopsoas; proper spinal alignment is addressed as well.  The final introductory chapter (Chapter 3) provides an analysis of joints, muscles, and the types of movements involved with each.<br /><br />Chapters 4 through 9 focuses on specific Pilates mat exercises.  The exercises are divided into foundational moves, abdominal work, flexible spine moves, functional spine moves, and core work.  The authors note that for each exercise, they have tried to provide the original name used by Joseph Pilates in his book Return to Life Through Contrology, and they rate the difficulty level of each exercise as fundamental, intermediate, or advanced.  Step-by-step instructions for performing the exercises are also provided.  This includes information on Technique Cues and Exercise Notes; some entries have optional sections on Modifications and Variations.  Finally, the targeting and accompanying muscles are both listed and highlighted in the series of illustrations which correspond to each exercise.<br /><br />Because the authors have attempted to stay as true to Joseph Pilates' original system as possible, readers who are familiar with contemporary practice may notice some differences.  The first is in the terminology.  For example, certain Pilates exercise names such as \\"Rolling Like a Ball,\\" have become so iconic that Mr. Pilates' original phrasing has been long since discarded.  In other respects, it is the actual execution of the movement which has changed.  The exercises Teaser and Open-Leg Rocker are both illustrated here with a slightly rounded, or C curve lower back, although a straight back is shown as a variation.  However, I have only ever seen the latter performed in modern-day instruction.  (For an example of this, see the cover of Brooke Siler's book The Pilates Body; Ms. Siler, another Pilates instructor who was schooled by first-generation teachers, is holding an open-leg rocker with a straight back.)<br /><br />Despite the minimal confusions which might arise related to the changes in the Pilates system over time, overall, the exercise descriptions are clear, straightforward, and informative.  I did think that the authors definitely should have included an index--this felt like a major oversight--and I had a few other minor issues with the final chapters as well.  In the main, however, this is an excellent resource on the musculature related to Pilates movement, and for that reason,I would highly recommend it.I would highly recommend it.
B004J713JW|5.0|A+ concert.  Audio and video is great.  Love watching it on my 58\\" TV.  Got to see him live with Elton John (2010) and nothing beats a well produced  audio over any live audio venue.  Enjoy it!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|That's right, Sucker Punch hits you at every level. I saw the theatrical release 3 times and knew I had to own the DVD. There is so much to analize and figure out I knew I had to see multiple viewing. This is a great, well thought out movie with more Jungian input then Joseph Campbell could deal with. The battle sequences are fantastic as well as the cinematography and the musical score. Get now. It's great.
B001QJR8KY|5.0|I came to studying music very late in life... at 59 to be exact. With no<br />hints of any musical aptitude before I laid my hand on an instrument,<br />in this case, the marimba. I have struggled with feeling good about<br />how I learn... it is a BIG learning curve. So I have sought out material<br />that would educated me about how to learn in a calm way... KENNY<br />WERNER was the perfect teacher for me... I wish I could have him as<br />a teacher in person. All being said, this book is excellent and worth<br />every moment reading and doing the exercises and meditations.
B003ZHVJFA|2.0|Growing up playing the Tekken games, the idea of a live-action Tekken film brought back memories of seeing other fighting games brought to the big screen, namely the Mortal Kombat films, two abysmal Street Fighter flicks, and the gloriously bad Dead or Alive adaptation from a few years back.  Combine that with the fact that the Tekken games feature so many characters with such convoluted backstories and storylines that it would be incredibly difficult to fit even a handful of them into a film and have it make a lick of sense...but here we are with Tekken the movie.  John Foo plays Jin Kazama, a young and talented martial artist living in a post-apocalyptic future run by the Mishima organization and led by father Heihachi (Mortal Kombat's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil son Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale).  After the death of Jin's mother, Jin sets his sights on the Mishima's by entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament, and soon runs into an assortment of familiar names like Christie (the smoking Kelly Overton), Steve Fox (Luke Goss), Bryan Fury (Gary Daniels), and Raven (Darrin Dewitt Henson), while also having brief interactions with characters like sisters Nina and Anna Williams, Eddy Gordo, Dragunov, and Marshall Law.  It's flashy, and even a little fun to a degree, but for the most part Tekken is lacking in all the departments that it appears to promise to the viewer in terms of martial arts action and mayhem.  Not to mention the fact that the cast is so over-the-top and some of the casting choices are beyond questionable.  Still though, it's better than any of the live action Street Fighter flicks ever were, so with that being said you could certainly do a lot worse.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My original processor cooler was not enough. When I demanded from it like playing graphics intensive games, it started to make a terrible screeching sound. I had to put a large fan blowing air directly to my opened computer case to make it more or less silent, but then there was the added noise of the fan.  My Cooler Master new cooler dropped dramatically my computer's temperature. I'd say around 35 to 40 degrees C. less. In addition it is almost completely noiseless, even with the double fan installed.  I had a computer pro friend to install it for me. That's why I rated 3 on setting it up. Is not easy.  All in all I am very very happy with this purchase, so far.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Growing up, I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd ever see a big-budget take on Thor: the classic Marvel Comics character that really never had the massive following or universal appeal that say, Spider-Man or the X-Men had, yet here we are.  Directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Hemsworth as the title character, Thor is a fairly brisk and wonderfully fun film that doesn't quite feel a major set-up for The Avengers movie like Iron Man 2 did before it.  Exiled to Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) to learn humility, Thor becomes attracted to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and seeks to return home to Asgard, while his nefarious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plots a hostile takeover of his homeworld.  With a wonderful cast that also features Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Colm Feore, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba, Ray Stevenson, and Jamie Alexander as fellow Gods and friends, Thor is a flat-out blast.  Even though it doesn't leave that same feeling of awe-inspiring awesomeness that the first Iron Man did, Thor is a great adaptation of a legendary comic book character, and here's hoping that the next time we see the Thunder God on the big screen, it will be just as good or hopefully even better.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I have tried a number of alarm clock apps.  This is by far the most feature packed. That said, I still prefer gentle alarm because of the pre alarm feature and night-time display.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme has NEVER been offered as a &quot;Free App of the Day&quot;. You people need to get you facts straight before you go giving bad reviews on great apps. This is the best alarm clock I&apos;ve ever used.
1594744769|5.0|I usually buy audio books. This was the first book, in years, I have bought on paper. Why? The description said there were pictures.  WOW! What a great job of picking pictures and creating a story around them. Great story line. Nice way to draw people in. I went thru and looked at all the pictures first just for fun. Loved how the characters stayed true and how the story developed.    So when is the next installment? This kind of thing calls for more 'picturestories'.
B000051Y0G|4.0|In 1984, She's So Unusual came right out of the blue to stun people with its vitality, exuberance, optimism and general wackiness.    It's was a very popular record in my school as one hit after another such as Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Time After Time sprung forth.    If you want to relive your youth, this reissue is worth considering. Never before seen pictures of Cyndi, new liner notes and three live bonus tracks such as She Bop, All Through The Night and Money Changes Everything makes you wanna have fun again!
B004WKOCP8|5.0|First off, I almost made the firm decision not to purchse this album, due to the mass negative reviews from critics.  I weighed my option by reading the reviews, then decided to give the audio samples a listen.  I was not impressed by what I heard.  I then decided, I'm going to by the album.  And let me tell you, I'm glad I did!  This album is a great addition to my Incubus collection and is definitley one of their best albums to date, both musically and considering originality.  Each song is great in it's own way and I completely love this album.  If you are a Science fan because you love Incubus, you will love this album.  And, didn't Science come out in 1997?? Then, why are we comparing the two albums.  Do the Chili Peppers sound the same as they did in the 80's? Metallica? 311? Pearl Jam?  No, No, No...as Eddie Vedder would say, \\"It's Evolution Baby!\\" This album is a must get.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Come on all you Warner honeys, black stripes blocking female body parts? I never laughed so hard as when the dominatrix from Justify my Love walked in or when Madonna was hitchhiking starkers in Erotica. This one is a must keep! It's a classic filled with unintentional hilarity!    You've got to admit - this collection is by far the most comprehensive with 47 clips. Making their long overdue appearance on a Madonna video collection are Into The Groove, True Blue, Live To Tell, Who's That Girl and I'll Remember. Obviously, Warner did not include everything, otherwise The Immaculate Collection and  93:99 will be obsolete. I know, it's more convenient to have everything in one package.     What's with Celebration? The old crotch grabbing Madonna looking like Gwen Stefani hanging out with people younger than her by 20 years. The plus side is that this version of Celebration is different from the audio counterpart.    The videos for This Used To Be My Playground, Dear Jessie and Everybody never made it to any Madonna DVD. (Or has it?). There are no official videos for Dress You Up, Causing A Commotion, Hanky Panky and Bye Bye Baby. So concert footage was used to promote these singles. A very curious omission is American Life. My guess is that Madonna did not want to offend the Bush Administration. But she has no problems taking liberties with religion because she knows that God is merciful.     I am also waiting to see if a compilation of Madonna's MTV and other TV performances will be issued.     My made in Singapore Celebration DVD is loud and clear in terms of sound. The picture quality is excellent. However, I can understand the complaints. I have some US DVDs. The audio is terribly soft and you have to turn the volume to full blast. Sometimes, the picture is rather fuzzy too.    Still in terms of content, Madonna Celebration beats the others hands down. The inner liner note doubles as a poster. So get it before it goes out of print!
B004VMVTNU|3.0|good app. definately worth the price. I have been using alarmdroid pro And like it a lot better. better customization and even a better looking widget.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|*cue up the James Brown guitar riffs*<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the latest reboot of the classic franchise, erasing the god-awful, best forgotten shlock Tim Burton forced upon us back in the nineties. The movie stars James Franco, John Lithgow, Frieda Pinto, Brian Cox, David Oyewelo and Tom Felton.  Screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver take the seeds of the original PotA franchise and nurture it along a more organic and logical path, which under the guidance of director Rupert Wyatt could ultimately end up as something truly special.  Unlike Birth of the Planet of the Apes, which was tacked-on to round out the storyline, this one's an origin story from the jump.<br /><br />Will Rodman (Franco) is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, testing his serum on chimpanzees, spurred by his father's (Lithgow) own illness.  Rodman's serum not only repairs brain cells as hoped, but improves upon undamaged ones by enhancing cognitive abilities in the chimps.  A tragic incident leads to the cancellation of the project and the animals being put down, but not before one of the test subjects has given birth.  Rodman takes the newborn chimp home, where he discovers the mother has passed her genetic enhancements along to her offspring.  Now named Caesar, he displays amazing skills and development as he matures, but their idyll is shattered when Caesar commits an act of violence against a neighbor and is taken away by Animal Services.  Being locked away and surrounded by his fellow simians for the first time proves to be a crisis moment for Caesar, one that will ultimately change the course of human history.<br /><br />Where to begin?  Firstly this is a great script, taking the franchise in directions it should've already gone.  The story feels and flows naturally, without relying upon cheesy gimmicks and laziness like time travel to resolve plot issues.  Classic lines and references from the original movie are dropped in both as homages and plot threads for the sequels (What? A space shuttle mission goes awry and both the ship and the crew went missing, you say?  Hmm...).  You should stick around as the credits roll for a minute to check out a slight teaser setting up the sequel's storyline, though from seeing the movie you'd already know what it is.  My only real complaint is the two most iconic lines from the original classic are used, but not very effectively.  The first one you can barely hear over the noise being made and the second was clearly forced into the scene it was used in, but it's Caesar's reaction to it that saves it (and that's two big hints for you).  It's been remarked elsewhere that the previews make Caesar look like a seething ball of simian rage- which isn't the case- and I have to agree.  This is the beginning of a saga- Caesar's journey from alienation into self-awareness that leads into accepting his role as a leader of his species.  A lot for a sci-fi flick, but that's why it works.<br /><br />The CGI is stellar.  Even though it's painfully obvious you're watching motion capture effects it works great, but more for the gorillas than the chimps.  Andy Serkis of Lord of the Rings fame supplies the motion capture for Caesar and the movements are flawlessly smooth, yet another installment in his already excellent body of work.  The acting is solid; James Franco is starting to grow on me and it's always good to see Brian Cox and John Lithgow.  Cox doesn't have all that much to do but Lithgow's good.  I also liked the music; Patrick Doyle is one of the all-timers of movie scoring and in the quieter moments the strings and drums supply that extra emotional impact like they should.  Looking forward to checking out the cd.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes is more than you'd expect from even a modern day sci-fi flick.  It's an origin story worthy of a legendary franchise, one that everyone except DC Comics seems to be able to pull off lately by completely investing the audience in the characters and the outcome (yeah, I'm still angry about Green Lantern!). Those expecting a film similar to Birth of the Planet of the Apes, climaxing with burning cities and apes grinding humans down into savagery will be disappointed, but you shouldn't be because this one is much more satisfying and enjoyable.  And there's so much more to come.  Once again Amazon needs a 10-star rating system- though it's not quite a 5-star movie, what the heck.  You won't find much better this summer.ngry about Green Lantern!).

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Great app, easy to use and does what it should. I will recommend this app to others. Thanks Amazon.  I have used the free version for months and love it.  the extras are a nice touch.
0553801473|1.0|Martin has lost control of this plot. This series has run amok like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time did at Book 5 (as others have pointed out). There is amazing detail about lifestyle and cool terminology, but the plot line went nowhere. It just keeps diverging. It really is torture to read. I've heard WOT has recovered with the new writer, perhaps that can happen here also.<br /><br />The American J. R. R. Tolkien?!? Ha! Not even close. This book has less progress than one chapter of the LOTR.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|just wanting to balance the stupid people rating one star because they think some reviews are fake. you guys are morons. this is a great app that does have some nice features the stock alarms do not have. take it or leave it, to each his own.
B0057KXXFM|3.0|If you remove the non-stop repeated, kindergarten lyrics this album is amazing. What sucks is I really wanted to like this album, I liked the previous albums and the reviews I had read for this were atleast 7/10 everywhere I looked. I just don't hear 4/10 for it. The worst thing is if the lyrics were even half as good as the songs they were layed over this album would easily have been a 8/10. And like a previous reviewer stated, we get it you \\"don't give a f***\\", it doesn't have to be stated in EVERY single song. All in all if you have $10 laying around and are considering this album, don't.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I was so excited to get it on DVD! I had not seen it in years! It was cool watching the movie and remembering bits and pieces of it. It has a lot more songs than I remember tho! Overall great movie!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|It&apos;s nice!  I prefer it over the stock HTC Droid Incredible 2 keyboard, though admittedly I haven&apos;t compared it to other &quot;custom&quot; keyboards.  It&apos;s kind of scary how well it sometimes predicts the next several words correctly.  It&apos;s not always right, but that means you just keep typing more letters until it gets it.  You&apos;d be typing it all on the stock keyboard so no loss even in the worst of cases.

1401216676|5.0|This was a great graphic novel,and was one of the firsts i have ever read.I was a bit dissapointed with the joker origin which seemed interesting at first but it was not what i expected it to be in the end and really could have been much better and more interesting.    Overall it is a great batman vs the joker story ehich anyone can enjoy and love with a okay joker origin but Nevertheless a great joker and batman comic.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I had my doubts before watching this show, but I was absolutely hooked after the first two episodes.  The show is amazing and gets better with every episode.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I was pretty hyped about getting these due to the good reviews I have seen on here, but was very disappointed with the sound quality when I received them. There is a slight hissing sound, lacks bass, too much treble. Makes you feel like you're underwater. If you end up getting these you're going to have to mess around with your sound settings. I managed to get the sound quality from crap to okay. Currently thinking about buying a headphones amp. Check out Turtle Beach headsets if you want something better.
0060734191|5.0|The trilogy is so descriptive you feel like you have been there. Such a gripping story line, and outstanding characters you will not want to put the book down. Sabriel and Lirael are great heroines for those who are looking for something different than the typical 'man saves the helpless woman' plot. Also a great cast of supporting characters.  I could not think of a better fantasy novel, and highly suggest you read it!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I was very pleased with this Special Platinum Edition. It contains 3 versions including the original theatrical version, which I watched very often in my childhood, the special edition which added new scenes with singing and dancing, and also the \\"work in progress\\" which is the film itself but with some parts shown as the original drawings of the animators. Over all a wonderful film for all ages!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Takes a couple levels to get the hang of the controls but easy afterwards. For those that said it&apos;s too hard too quickly, well the world needs ditch diggers too. Seriously, it might just not be your type of game. Don&apos;t ask them to dumb it down and ruin it for everyone else. Got to Sector 2, level 15 pretty quickly ... and I&apos;m no rocket surgeon. ;o)

B004VMVTNU|4.0|This does not wake up the gTablet from sleep mode, making it completely useless on that device. However, I killed that tablet and have moved on. My Galaxy S Wifi 5.0, on the other hand, runs this great. It is very, very easy to hit the snooze button because it's pretty much the entire screen. I think there are settings to change that, but I like it that way.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Like many others have mentioned I&apos;ve been using the free version for a while now and got this when it appeared. You can set multiple alarms with many ways to customize your alarm.

(Even when airplane mode is on) LG Optimus V.
1594202842|3.0|I can see why this book started the national conversation in the media about parenting. Yet, it is not a parenting book, it is only a memoir with no thesis statement. I remember having a brief conversation with a Chinese-immigrant friend about the book, when she quickly clarified to me Amy Chua is not Chinese, but Philippine. I think that is a very important fact; both her parents were born and raised in the Philippines, and migrated to the U.S. when Chua was still a baby.<br />As an immigrant myself (moved to start college in the U.S.) this book left me with many more questions, instead of giving me the answers I erroneously expected. When analyzing the three generations of 'Chinese' immigrants, how come the author doesn't acknowledge the fact of the declining economy that has forced families to change dynamics? Mostly with an academic background in International Development, I was shocked to see how Chua doesn't apply the well-known facts of globalization and its consequences to family dynamics; to be more specific the fact that one income is no longer enough to keep a middle-class lifestyle, which led me to question the real amount of time Chua spent with her  daughters as she never paused her career to prioritize such supposedly strict upbringing.<br />If Chua was so proud of being Chinese, how come she didn't marry a Chinese man to facilitate her agenda? Why are so many Chinese-American women marrying Caucasian men? Even though Chua studied Development in Latin America, how come she completely ignored Latin American parenting styles, mostly with the immense number of Latina nannies in this country. Why did she express such disrespect for Latin American culture when writing about the International food festival and the South American food she was 'forced' to cook by the private school she paid for her prodigy daughters to study?<br />While the 'Chinese' and 'Asian' words were repeated in the book more times that necessary, Chua's interpretation of 'Asian' excludes ancient wisdom, such as meditation, Buddhism, and the pursuit of happiness. The book seems more like an effort to define who she really is, which implies that at her late forties, with two 'successful' daughters and an impressive career, Chua has deep identity issues, which were painfully projected on her daughters and created a hostile family environment, including the embarrassing fact that her Jewish husband was a zero to the left and purposely excluded from the parenting process.<br />I have seen many impressive kids who grow up to be miserable failed adults. I don't think Chua's daughters are old enough to know whether this upbringing really worked or not. The book is proof of the miserable, full of anger and negative emotions family life in that household. Chua's goal was and continues to be getting public praise for her daughters musical abilities, and I think that is the real season of writing the book, for the world to know what a 'good' mother she is, and that is a very shallow goal for an authentic Asian wise person.<br />I need to follow my old rule of, if a book gets praise in mainstream media, it is probably more the buzz than the content of the book. There is still some value in reading it.wisdom, such as meditation, Buddhism, and the pursuit of happiness.

B005D66DOI|2.0|An increasingly non-credible story line coupled with a series of out of character mistakes has put me off the Dexter series. This episode was the last straw in that it has almost no character development while the cast seems to be getting into ever more complex but ultimately superficial problems. Stick to the first seasons and continue watching at your own peril.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|finally purchased this and couldnt be happier.  fantastic packaging and all six seasons of lost plus bonus material.  i would recommend this to anyone! great gift idea also.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this show.  I purchased all three seasons and have #4 on order.  Very little on TV this summer and this show was better than any I have seen in a long time.  Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are excellent.  Hope this show stays around forever.  Love it!!
0071762345|5.0|There are so many books out there that teaches all the what to do on social media but not many teaches you about the HOW TO which is more important.

B00000J1YR|4.0|Excellent.  Obviously, the songs are performed on stage rather than outside a recording booth.  Yes, the acoustics are raw and the occasional missed note to be expected.

B003Y5H542|5.0|Hollywood heavyweight Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) team up to bring the tale of the most unlikely hero of the Old West in the critically acclaimed animated comedy hit Rango. An oddball pet chameleon (Depp) is accidentally left stranded in the middle of the scorching Mojave Desert and wanders to a small town inhabited by desert animals, where he assumes the identity of a tough drifter named Rango. After killing a fierce hawk out of sheer dumb luck, Rango is named the town's newest sheriff, and attempts to solve the water shortage that has placed the town in the brink of despair. Rango is the funniest animated family movie of 2011. Verbinski delivers a crowd-pleasing animated spectacle with a fun-filled storyline, amusing characters, stunning computer animation and a fine comical performance by Johnny Depp. Rango also features the voice talents of Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Stephen Root, Harry Dean Stanton and Timothy Olyphant.<br /><br />It wouldn't be right calling the Blu-ray release of Rango anything but one of the best Blu-rays of the year. The theatrical and extended versions are included in this release. The animated comedy is presented in a 2.40:1 widescreen format. The 1080p transfer is absolutely flawless and gorgeous. The DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack will surely satisfy the needs of home theater enthusiasts. The Blu-ray includes a fine selection of bonus features like an audio commentary track by director Gore Verbinski and production crew, the 2-part making-of featurette \\"Breaking the Rules: Making Animation History\\", 8 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, picture-in-picture storyboards, and a n interactive tour of the town of Dirt and its townsfolk. Overall, Rango scores an \\"A-\\".

I saw this movie when it was released at the theater many years ago. I have practically worn out my VHS, yes VHS release of this film. It gets better every time. Now I see it is on Blu-Ray so I will purchase it. My hats off to the wonderful job the actors did in their recreations of these historic individuals. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have an interest in the Civil War.
1594744769|4.0|I was enthralled by this book from the very first page, mainly because I could relate so well. My grandfather also loved to spin fantastical stories to keep me entertained as a child. I think we all have one of those charismatic family members, who can almost make you believe the stories they weave. With that said, I enjoyed how Mr. Riggs created a world from this type of premise.     I only have a few downfalls to point out (which are easily redeemed by the rest of the story). The middle lagged for me. But it picked up again as soon as Jacob learns who his enemies are. Also, I thought there could have been more in the way of character development. There was awesome story-telling, and awesome descriptions of the peculiars' abilities. But I would have liked to have known more about Jacob, and probably Emma too. Emma was very one dimentional to me.    Aside from those things, I was very entertained by Mr. Rigg's first novel. His narrative flows very smoothly and the descriptions of the island and the peculiars' house allowed me to envision his settings perfectly. The pictures only added to the writing. I definitely liked them for this story.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|great game ....quick start...easy out great for breaks and very entertaining yet challenging...i never review apps but i thought this one deserved it\n
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite scores. Every track is terrific, and it's what made me first fall in love with Mr. Zimmer and his film music. It helps that I love the history behind it, too, and also enjoyed the original version of the film from the 1960s \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\" (with Alec Guinness and Sophia Loren). The tracks alternate between the Holst-influenced battle scenes (\\"The Battle\\") to the lovely Lisa Gerrard tracks. So often very ethereal, very soothing. Other times, serious and gloomy. But this is the score that influenced so many film composers over the last decade, so many in imitation, and has even caused Zimmer to remark regretfully that so many of the scores sound the same now. It's the essential Zimmer sound, and perhaps the best all-around example of his magnificent work.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Very time consuming. Great game for those of you who like spatial \/math \/ logic type puzzles. I enjoy trying to optimize the solution for each level since I am a geek.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have owned a Swivel Sweeper previously, but could not find in stores.  Ordered from Amazon and it was so easy, and now I have my Swivel Sweeper.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) continue their search for the pieces of Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and return to Hogwarts for a final showdown.    Unless you're already steeped in Harry Potter lore, you would do well to rewatch Part 1 (or at least review the synopsis on Wikipedia) before seeing this.  I didn't, and I didn't have a photographic memory of the last film, so I was a little confused in the beginning (Sword of Gryffindor?  Oh yeah--Dobby died.  Where'd that wandmaker come from?), but that's okay.  I wouldn't have wanted them to waste valuable screen time rehashing all that.      Where the last film gave our heroes some much needed quiet time before the storm, this film is a series of special effects set pieces.  There are so many loose ends to tie up and so many characters to bid farewell that the screenplay begins to resemble a checklist at times.  Some of the characters receive very short shrift, but that can't be helped.  The filmmakers didn't have the luxury of an unlimited running time, as J.K. Rowling did when she wrote her book.  This barrage of magical artifacts and familiar faces had the unfortunate result of making none of it feel particularly important, but the film still worked for me because the friendship between our three heroes remained firmly in the foreground.  So I was satisfied with the conclusion of their story even though I wasn't much concerned with the fate of each Magical Whatsit and I was underwhelmed by the final showdown with Lord Voldemort.  I appreciated the little epilogue at the end.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Runs great on lg optimus.\nI love the game but it would be so much better if there was a zen garden update. That would be nice.
6304806442|5.0|Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his cronies (Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, and Robert Carlyle) are young (mostly) heroin addicts in economically depressed Edinburgh of the 90s.  This film follows their lives, particularly Renton as he drifts in and out of the straight life.    By avoiding any strident proselytizing or easy judgments and simply portraying the addicted lifestyle in a closely observed, pragmatic style, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge have produced one of the most powerful statements against drug use ever put on screen.  But don't let that put you off by making the film seem like a downer.  It also features some of the most exuberant filmmaking I've ever seen and a masterful wedding of music with subject manner.  It's also rare to see a film so successfully combine harrowing scenes of appalling behavior with laugh out loud comedic moments.  Highly recommended.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I struggled a bit about what rating to give this, but in the end I had to confess that it really is a great product in every way. I love the grip and the buttons. And the way it shuts down to save battery life is impressive. It's lasts much, much longer than the standard issue PS3 controller.<br /><br />The question of whether or not you will enjoy this will probably hinge on whether you like the ergonomic layout, with the left button switched with the four way controller. Playing Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas I found it a little difficult to use. Switching weapons was a tad difficult during gameplay because my left thumb couldn't easily reach the button. I never really got comfortable with the repositioning of those buttons, and therefore this will probably just be a backup controller. I'll use the main controller until it runs out of juice and then switch, which will entail saving the game and then closing out in order to selecting the other controller.<br /><br />Still, if you can deal with the switched buttons, you will probably prefer this one to the controller that comes with the box.
B003Y5H5A6|4.0|In the days of WWII, ninety-pound weakling Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) becomes Captain America when he is injected with a super-soldier serum, just in time to save our grandfathers and grandmothers from the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).    This is one of the more successful Marvel Comics adaptations to date.  Director Joe Johnson does a great job of creating period atmosphere and a grand war-time adventure.  Evans projects the ideal blend of sincerity and naivety both as Rogers and Cap.  I'm glad they resisted the temptation to turn him into a smart-@$$.  Some exceptional CGI is used to shrink him down to an emaciated youth for the origin story; it's absolutely seamless and perhaps the most successfully subtle use of computer graphics since Gollum in Lord of the Rings.  Weaving makes a great Red Skull; I hope they find a way to bring him back for a future sequel.  Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell provide excellent support in pivotal roles.  This is the final stepping stone on the path to The Avengers movie next summer.  Bring it on!
030726999X|3.0|I gave the first two in the series 5 stars, and said I couldn't put them down. This one was a chore. First of all, the most interestingly preposterous character, Lizbeth, is only in about 20% of the book. And, while I'm walking a tightrope here by trying not to give anything away, the rest of the book has to do with the Swedish Secret Police or a subsection thereof.<br /><br />There was no excitement in this last of the trilogy. It or I just plodded along. And I needed a Trip-Tik to remember who was who until I decided halfway through that it didn't matter. Everybody has the same name or similar names, so I just made up nicknames for them (without umlauts).<br /><br />When I said that Lizbeth was a \\"preposterous\\" character, that was not a slight. It seems that all my favorite novels (like Mitch Rapp) have unlikely people with superhuman capabilities. But Lizbeth WAS the first two in the series, and in this last one, she was an adjunct character. She was still preposterous, but the ending took the cake. (Has to do with a nail gun.)<br /><br />It was almost as though Larsson knew he was dying and rushed to finish \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" Had he lived longer, I'm sure this would have been better and a fourth volume would have been in the works.<br /><br />(P.S. A useful trick to envision the countryside and the secondary primary character, Blomkvist, is to watch at least one of the PBS series, \\"Wallander,\\" starring Kevin Branaugh, which takes place and was filmed in Sweden.<br /><br />That's my take on \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" My wife finished it in a day-and-a-half and couldn't put it down. But she couldn't get through the first chapter of \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" To each his/her own.
014241493X|3.0|I liked this book while reading it, I thought it was funny, and the main character while being pessimistic some times was enjoyable. It's the ending that got me. It ends on a sad note (sorry for the spoiler alert, but it's true) and I wish I had stopped after about 50 pages, it would have been better.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Needs a better auto correct feature similar to the default droid x2 keyboard. Other that that this app is totally awesome and I highly recommend it.
0345529057|1.0|Explicit Paedophilia contents. Very Inappropriate. Sexualised pre-pubescent children and inaccurately portayed their response to sexual stimuli. Really should be banned. Just shows you how SICK the media industry is that it promoted it into a series.     Other than that, I am an avid sci fi reader and the rate of made-up names you're required to learn in each chapter - from word Go - is ridiculous. Seriously, who Published this???    Psychologist
B000E1NWGO|5.0|My brother bought an LP of Rubinstein's recording of the \\"Appassionata\\" sonata when he was in high school.  If it had any grooves left, it's a miracle--the whole family couldn't get enough of it.  NOBODY plays the coda of the first movement with such fire.  The slow movement will leave you awe-stricken.  The last variation, before the theme returns, is simply magical.  It would bring a smile to a child's face.  The third movement ends with lots of thunder.  You simply haven't heard Beethoven's \\"Appassionata\\" sonata until you've heard Rubinstein play it.  Does the foregoing sound like so many cliches?  Just listen to the music.  You will also be at a loss for words that do justice to this wonderful recording.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I thought this movie was fabulously funny and warm-hearted, poignant and tender, bitter and sweet. In other words, just like our real relationship(s) in life. Steve Carell was brilliant as the cuckolded husband who had to find his groove (again) after slipping into the humdrum of benign neglect, Ryan Gosling couldn't have been better in the role of the dazzling womanizer who surprised himself by falling in love, Julianne Moore nailed it as the wife who couldn't quite figure out what she wanted now that she'd up-ended everything and everyone. Every one of the youngsters in the film had such sweetness to them, and yet were so real, just like any kid of their various ages. Emma Stone was just the right balance of vulnerable woman and strong.    When we finally see how all the pieces of this seemingly random puzzle come together, it's brilliant. Couldn't be better, or more touching-while-funny. In fact, I was in a full theater of mostly 50's and 60's age adults, and the place rocked with laughter from the start of the film to the finish.    This is a movie NOT to be missed!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Says it&apos;s 99&#162; buts it&apos;s crossed out and gave it to me free! Stupid Amazon! \n\nBut seriously, great game. The controls aren&apos;t very precise unless you use the rotate buttons and the font IS tiny, but those are minor gripes in an otherwise great, challenging game.
0553801473|1.0|Wouldn't you think that after reading the boring book four I'd have had the brains enough not to buy book 5? In my own defense I have to say that somewhere or other I got the notion that book 5 would end the series, and so I bought it, just to see how it ended. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this waste of time and money still has two more books to go before the series mercifully ends.<br /><br />I have managed to wade through 300 pages of A Dance with Dragons and cannot bring myself to finish this seemingly endless mess of going nowhere. I almost said \\"going nowhere fast,\\" but in fact, A Dance with Dragons goes nowhere painfully sloooowly.<br /><br />What happened to the forward momentum that drove the first three books? What happened to characters we care about? What happened to--oh, never mind, if I keep this up it'll end up as long-winded as the book.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Developers need to rework the beginning portion of the game with the instructions. I was initially turned off by the game and had to will myself to stick with it.  As for the game itself, you have something great in your hands.  It's an entertaining, straightforward game where increases in the level of difficulty is well-paced.
B002PEP4U0|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet and I'm enjoying it, but using the Kindle word search feature, it turns out windmills are not really discussed until about halfway through the book.  While the front half has its merits, it could do with some heavier editing.    Still it's a good read in that it depicts daily life in Malawi and you can see that having crazy McGyver skills is all a part of what you need just to get anything done in the village.  You don't go down to the local store to get hunting gear.  You make rope out of tree bark and a spear point by banging a large nail into shape with wrench.  A soccer ball is made out of a bundle of shopping bags tied together with some twine.  What you get from the front half is no one is going to sell you a windmill kit in a box.  If you want something, you've got to figure out how to make from the materials at hand.      I have a hard time figuring out at what age the book should be read.  There is talk of rape, murder and alcoholism but this also what life is like in rural Africa.  I would like to see this book read in high schools to give kids a bigger world view.     The book would benefit from some more photos.  I'd especially like to see some of the other things the author has crafted.
B00000JGHM|1.0|I just did a search on the full screen dvds for HEAT and you have it listed under the full screen. I ordered this dvd and had to send it back because your advertising was misleading.  Please correct this problem so it doesn't disappoint other customers.  When will HEAT be available in full screen?  If you cannot accommodate, please provide me with someone who can!
B000YE3MZ2|5.0|I got a moderately used one for around five dollars, and I'm extremely happy with it. :) I've been searching for a vinyl copy of this album for years at garages sales and what not, and finally I saw one up here, and I jumped in and snatched it.
158270208X|5.0|Small journal with softly colored pages and cover that looks like old leather with a fold-over closure and ribbon page marker. Very well made and a pleasure to use.
0439023521|5.0|I've heard a lot about this book and finally broke down and read it today.  The good word of mouth was dead on.  The plot itself is great, and the pacing of the book was spot on.  It should please anyone who is a fan of dystopian fiction. Be aware that the book is a bit more in line with The Long Walk by Stephen King or Lord of the Flies than 1984 or Animal Farm - in other words, this is much more action driven than idea or dialogue driven.      It's a bit surprising to me (but maybe I'm dating myself at the ripe old age of 32 for saying this) that this book is recommended for grades 7 and up. While there's no overly graphic descriptions of death or killings, there are still killings.  And the people getting killed are kids as young as 12.  The reader KNOWS that the deaths are coming, just by reading the dust jacket, and the author does an excellent job of making the suspense leading up to the deaths more gut renching that the actual description of the deaths themselves.  It's this suspense that, to me, makes the book pretty gruesome.  And probably a bit too much for kids still in the 7th grade.    It would be great if the author expands more on the actual politics behind this future society in the next two books, but The Hunger Games as it stands is still an excellent read.
0553381695|5.0|This book was amazing!! From the first sentence I didn't want to put it down. I couldn't get enough. There's non stop action and intrigue with the characters you love and the characters you love to hate. The plot just keeps thickening, and I can't even begin to imagine where it will lead! I could gush on and on, but I won't. If you liked Game of Thrones, run, don't walk to get A Clash Of Kings. I know I am running out to get the rest of this series!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|The game is entertaining and enjoyable, but the scoring needs to be tweaked. I assumed it was based on the least items used but a couple levels in I discovered it was the opposite. More items used is good...and then I noticed it&apos;s more so just items on the screen. They don&apos;t have to contribute anything beneficial to be counted for points. Gives you a chance to make cool shapes with lasers though.
0553386794|5.0|An amazing world of fantasy, suspense, humor, intrigue, and deceit! I was continually eager to find out what was going to happen next. I love the way each chapter is named for the point of view of the person in that chapter, and I loved how the author sometimes ended each chapter with a cliffhanger that made you want to skip ahead to the next chapter told by that character!! I fully appreciate stories where things don't always work out, and aren't as they'd seem. It was nice to see those risks being taken in Game of Thrones. The ending had my jaw dropping for sure. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!
0439023513|5.0|This was certainly a bit more edgy and gruesome than it's predecessors, but this book hit home for me as the wife of someone who is mentally \\"altered\\" from the Iraq war. This book was saddening with the losses, and with Katniss' need to make choices as the mockingjay as well as for her own life as a young woman. I felt sickeningly sad for Peeta and all he endured, and sad for Gale with his predicaments. It was a dark and hard read, and at times I doubted I would be satisfied with the ending, but I very much was. Colin's took a crap situation and worked it out.
0553582038|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this book that's any different than I've already said about the previous 3 books. I can't express enough how much I love this series. The only thing that I didn't like was that it ended too soon. I can't wait for book 5!!
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I loved this book!  The author really makes the individuals that make up Google come alive, so much so, that I almost can \\"feel\\" what Google is all about now.  The book really pulls you in with riveting stories about how various Google products were born.  And each story seems to reinforce the idea that to solve problems, one has to sprinkle in some imagination, gather the facts & data and just apply scientific thought (of course I'm sure it helps to have smart engineers).  Finally, as a software engineer myself, this book was also motivational because it shows how a group of smart engineers, who have the right long term vision and the necessary resources, can basically change the world for the better.
055357342X|5.0|This series just keeps getting better. I seem to love each book more than the one before it, though, that could be so because I keep being more satisfied as questions are answered and plot thickens. I don't know how many times I wanted to throw this book across the room in frustration. I don't know how many times I screamed aloud \\"What the HELL?!\\" I don't know how many times I wanted to cry, laugh, or beam. This book took me through the emotional gamut again and again. Simply amazing!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This player works very well and performs as advertised. Sounds great and works well with either a thumb drive or SD Card. IMO a good value for the price.    The only suggestion I would have for the manufacturer would be the option to AUTO Save the bookmark at shut down. I have hundreds of 1 hour long, single file (no breaks between songs), files and if I forget to clear then set a new bookmark it just repeats from the last bookmark. As these files are long, there is no way to FF within a given file.
0470876417|3.0|I've used the business model template from this book more times than I can count, on everything from small projects to new start-ups. I work more in the world of the former and, while that's not what this is made for, it makes a lot of sense to think of new products and services as whole new business models.<br /><br />A lot of people really like the garish layout of this book, with page after page of photos that aren't content, but serve as wallpaper for the written and illustrated content. This is an approach that many people greatly enjoy and has no doubt contributed to the book's success. From an information design standpoint its a travesty, making the book very difficult to read.<br /><br />The information herein is incredibly useful, despite the horrid design and the book's odd dimensions which serve the sole purpose of catering to the wallpaper and not the content. But if you can filter out the wallpaper you'll find a lot of very good information in here which can be creatively applied to create, streamline, or sanity-check any business model.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|this game is a lot of fun, I just wish there was some way to view the solution for a puzzle, I&apos;m stuck on one! PS stop whining about permissions, you people act like your government operatives or something that you need secrecy, if you don&apos;t want apps gaining access or knowing what your doing, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a motor razr still floating out there that a little more your speed.
1451629184|3.0|I have been a bit fascinated with the story of Jaycee Dugard since the story of her release broke in August 2009. She's been understandably out of the media spotlight, so when I heard she was releasing a book about her experience I immediately ordered it on Amazon. A mother of two girls myself, one older than her oldest and one in between her two, I was curious about how she took on that unplanned role as well, in such unusual conditions.    I am glad I read her memoir (over the course of three days at the beach) because I wanted to know her account of events and her take on why things happened the way they did. It is however a difficult book to read, not just because of the subject matter (she is, as others have said, quite direct about what was done to her) but also because she is not a writer. Having read other memoirs of harrowing events (Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air,\\" about the Mt. Everest climbing disaster) I suppose my expectations were a little high. In her defense, she states at the very beginning that she is not a writer. I wish I'd peeked inside the book a little to see that there was no real editing or assistance from other writers, though I'd have bought it anyway because getting her story was very important to me. Most of the book felt as if I was reading her journal. It jumps around and seems to leave out several years of her captivity. There was definitely no ghost writer here, which is a good thing, but the book seems to lack a sense of drawing the reader in and keeping her hanging on each page. The subject matter itself does that for the most part, but I found several chapters that could have used editing and others that could have been expanded. I realize she has probably forgotten large periods of time (and probably just as well for her) and so can only share what has endured.     And endured, I'd have to say, is the key word to describe this woman. I dare say that nine out of ten girls could not have endured what she did and live to be as seemingly grounded as she sounds. Lots of therapy has certainly helped and will likely continue to be a part of her life and her daughters' lives for years to come. I suspect her story will be a case study in college psychology and sociology classes for years to come (perhaps law classes as well).    I have not seen her interview with Diane Sawyer yet (I don't watch a lot of tv and found out about it after the fact) but plan to watch it soon on Hulu. I believe that's been her only interview thus far and I hope will round out some of the rough edges of the book.    Now that I have read her account, I plan to read John Glatt's version. With relatives in law enforcement, I am also interested in the viewpoint from investigators and other outsiders as the case unfolded.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|This film is more of a war movie than a sci-fi movie. There is some character development for those who look for it, but it is mostly a war movie, albeit with aliens. It illustrates really well the reason why troops hate urban warfare: the casualties pile up really high and you can't tell very well where the enemy is shooting at you from. The scenes are graphic.     The pro-Marine esprit de corps is high in this movie, which I can understand since many Marines see the Corps almost as a cult. Needless to say, some people got turned off by this either because they dislike Jarheads (understandable) or because the \\"sophisticates\\" hate the military. Whatever.    Another thing: I can't see why some would compare this film to District 9, which is about apartheid, and why others compare it to Independence Day, which screenplay was apparently written by a high school dropout and a Zionist. It's like comparing the Bible to a crossword puzzle (with mistakes in the puzzle).
B0012IXIZI|5.0|Wow! I can't believe Bob Sagat managed to summarize both seasons 1 and 2 in less than 3 minutes. And, I didn't even break a sweat. Still, Bob Sagat's voice is soothing to listen to and has an ability to deliver crisp narration.<br /><br />Whether you're just reliving the moments or you don't have time to catch up with seasons 1 and 2 and is anxiously waiting to watch seasons 3 and beyond, this short summary is perfect!
B004YEJGEO|1.0|I think the concept for this game is clean and simple but yet fun and addictive. However, it appears that the prisms on some levels don&apos;t redirect or split the light as intended. I found an online solution site, refractionguide.co.uk, and tried copying some of the solutions. i even uninstalled and reinstalled the game but it didn&apos;t work. Is anyone having similar issues? If this is fixed i would rate 5 stars.
B003ASLJS6|1.0|If you do not mind your DVDs looking like good VHS and your blu-rays looking like average DVDs then purchase Warner Bros. releases and you'll be pleased.    The DVD release of Pale Rider is about as bad as they come..even for WB.    Really looks bad.  Terrible grain throughout.   Contrast(black level) off THROUGHOUT...Either looks very washed out or too dark to see..    I'm not exaggerating. It isnt uncommon for many WB blu-rays to look sub par..But their DVDs usually are watchable. IT'S PRESSED ON A SINGLE LAYER DVD..THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING.    The movie was good but I went blind after viewing for a few days due to the terrible transfer.
0553801473|2.0|Bottom line review of this book: it is boring. It also left me feeling manipulated and cheated.  I'm tired of dead people coming back to life, cliff hangers with no resolution, and page after page of nothing happening. I actually got tired during A Feast for Crows, and didn't do more than skim Dance. It sat on my shelf for a while before I even did that.<br /><br />The first three books were a wonder, and I'm glad to have found them. But I won't be following this series anymore. By the time the next book is written, I won't even be sorry.
B0043X7WLA|4.0|At first,I surprized about this album.<br />My image is Michigan's beautiful & folk taste for him.<br /><br />But after I went to his stage @Brooklyn Prospect Park.<br />I understood.<br />He changed.<br /><br />His stage was fantastic performance.<br />I felt little similar to David Bowie.<br /><br />I love his earlier music is still,<br />But I also like his new style.
B004YEJGEO|2.0|The game is a good idea, but it takes way too long to pick up apparently (too boring to try so far). The game hasn&apos;t gotten harder, it just takes more objects to get to the same goal. I suppose the later stages might be harder.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a fun and clever game but it takes a while to get interesting.  After about 30 levels I was ready to call it quits because the levels didn't feel challenging, just tedious.  But shortly after this the difficulty ramps up-- the boards are more constrained and you can't just slap everything onto the screen wherever you first think to-- and I found the game a lot more enjoyable.  I've had quite a few fun hours with this game already and I'm only a little more than halfway through.  I recommend it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love it and on wifi even faster so u shud download thiz but dont use advanded task killer while download will kill the app and video but over all itz great
0756404738|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series.<br /><br />Rothfuss exhibits a finesse with the English language that I have not seen in many fantasy authors, and his plot, world, and character development have been on point and fantastic ever since Name Of The Wind.
B00003CXAT|5.0|I have to admit to some bias in this review - this film came out when I was about eight years old, and has been a favorite of mine ever since. It helped that as a kid I was a huge dinosaur nerd (my coloring books, story books, movies, etc., were all dinosaur themed); but what sealed the deal were the fantastic animatronic and CGI dinosaurs. Back then, story and characters didn't matter so much, as long as the bad guy got what was coming to him and the good guys made it out ok - and the dinosaurs looked awesome.<br />Since then, my tastes have, I trust, matured somewhat. So I was extremely pleased when I watched Jurassic Park recently to see that the story and characters that I had accepted so easily as a kid still stood up. And, yes, I was pretty thrilled to see that these dinosaurs from 1993 looked more believable and \\"real\\" than anything I have ever seen in film since - including in Peter Jackson's King Kong.<br /><br />An overview of the story of this film probably is not necessary by this point, but, just in case...the main characters are Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleontologist and a paleobotanist (respectively); they are called, for their expert opinion, by a wealthy investor, John Hammond, to \\"Jurassic Park\\". Jurassic Park is a theme park created by the aforementioned Mr. Hammond, on which he's created live dinosaurs. Throw in a greedy programmer (whose screens show what looks to be real code, btw :) ) who wants to steal and sell dinosaur embryos to a rival company, a giant storm, and power outages ... and, well, I'm sure you can imagine: chaos ensues. There is much chasing, running, hiding, etc., until, at length, the escape is made. As to who lives and who dies, well, you'll have to watch the movie to find that out -- and I highly recommend that you do!<br /><br />5/5 stars.
1439152799|4.0|You have to be into gothic fiction to like this book.     The novel is a very well-researched romp through WWII England. As other reviewers have stated it is a bit longer than it needed to be, but I was okay with that. I found that once in the story, as with all good stories, I didn't want it to end. I was happy to have an extra hundred pages to savor what turned out to be a satisfying ending.     Also there is the plot problem of Saffy finding and reading Juniper's diary about events Juniper hadn't been home to write about. Meh. I can overlook it because it was such a good read otherwise.     This is a bit of a departure for Morton. Her previous novels did not weave the stories of so many characters together. Well done. I look forward to seeing what she has to offer in her next novel.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I&apos;ve been using this for a long time; ever since I bought my phone actually. I used the free version for about a month and then decided to buy the full version. Even though it&apos;s available free today, I don&apos;t regret one bit paying for this, it&apos;s well worth it.\n\nThis alarm clock has so many features you can customize, it&apos;s guaranteed you&apos;ll find a way that won&apos;t let you over sleep! You can solve math problems to shut it off, or even make it so it won&apos;t stop sounding off until you&apos;re in your car traveling a minimum of 25 mph on your way to work! How does that sound for wake up insurance?\n\nI confess, I tried Gentle Alarm for a while when Amazon offered it free... but after a short while I switched to Alarm Clock Xtreme again and never looked back. It simply can&apos;t be beat!\n\nIf you&apos;re not getting it for free, there&apos;s the &apos;lite&apos; or free version to try out (can&apos;t remember what exactly it&apos;s called) but I think you&apos;ll realize as quick as I did that this is a dev worth supporting!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|One of the greatest military epics ever produced. A truly outstanding performance by George C. Scott. Gripping, emotional and subtle humor at it's finest.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book. A modern woman tries to deny what she is only to find she must accept what she is. And she falls in love in the process.<br /><br />But most important to me is the lesson of how bigotry can blind societies with hate and dominance. And this applies to us, folks! I am anglo-to-boot and have lived in bigot communities (most unfortunate for me). Let's face it, if all the characters in this novel were human, this book would be banned in many communities because of its open frankness to the reality in our world.<br /><br />A great supernatural story with a fantastic underlying message.
0553801473|1.0|Perfect example of a brilliant story utterly destroyed by the creator himself... what a shame. I can't think of any reason why the writer, editors, publishers can let this happen other than to line their pockets. What would have been 3 books of literary masterpiece exploded into an indefinite number of books of utter ruination.<br /><br />Watching the HBO series of A Game of Thrones just made the loss from reading AFFC amd ADWD more painful and unbearable. If I were HBO, I would rethink the series with the direction the writer is taking the books. If (and that's a big IF) HBO decides to finish the series to the very end (whenever that may be), I hope they spare the TV audience from 2 seasons of AFFC and ADWD doldrum and either combine these into one season or scrap these altogether. A Song of Fire and Ice may yet become a well-loved masterpiece (even if in another platform) and prove deserving of its following.
0071762345|5.0|Sure, there are a lot of books on the topic.  What makes this book a \\"must have\\" for any executive or business professional is the theme of how to be likeable in social media.  If I had $100 for every marketing or business professional that treats LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook as their personal marketing site, I would be able to own my private island in the South Pacific and the airplane to get me there.      If you find someone totally clueless on the ability to become likeable, send them a copy of this book.  It may help them.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|i tried this game. i like the concept but seems like the controls are abit off. i would touch dead center in the circle of the item and instead moving in place it would spin. idk if thats just how it is on my phone or not but thats what happened. 5 star for concept,minus one for that. as for the people that paid....i guess you rated your stupidity but i think you rated too high. and to those that said charge more, dont be stupid telling someone to charge more is like telling the gas company to charge $10 instead of $4. these are hard times
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm extremely happy with my DVD FIREFLY, the complete series. This is by far, the very best SC-FI series ever written! Joss Whedon is a genius! I LOVE all the characters in the series, especially the character of Captain Malcolm Reynolds, so very aptly and skillfully played by Nathan Fillion. The story of the FIREFLY and its crew is delightful, bizarre at times, funny, deadly serious with a lot of violence, action packed and never disappoints the viewer. Nathan Fillion has to be one of the most courageous actors of his time taking on a role where in one episode he appears nude. The nude scenes are done in a puckish manner with taste and great aplomb. I do not recommend that young children be allowed to watch it.
1878424319|5.0|I had to read portions of this book back in high school. It was good, but I wasn't old enough to appriciate it. Now going back and reading it, I remember all the great things this book has to offer. Definitely worth a read.

B004YCKITI|4.0|Review for Blu-ray edition:<br /><br />Often overshadowed by \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" released In 1991' \\"Copycat\\" is a clever thriller with strong performances from Signorney Weaver and Holly Hunter that helps to elevate the material above your average thriller. Like a lot of thrillers released In The wake of \\" Silence\\", \\"Copycat\\" might of seemed to some critics and viewers to live up to it's title despite the fact that the plot was completely different.<br /><br />Weaver plays Dr. Helen Hudson a psychologist consultant to the FBI called in to help catch a copycat serial killer (William McNamara); the only problem is that Hudson suffers from agoraphobia (a fear of open spaces) due to an attack by an earierl serial killer (Harry Connick, Jr.). Hudson uses her insight to help detectives M J Monahan (Hunter) and Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney)to track down the copycat killer but her disability increasingly becomes a challenge for both the detectives and Hudson herself.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Amiel (\\"[[ASIN:B000K7VHH8 Entrapment [Blu-ray]]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B00007HGIJ The Singing Detective]]\\"[[ASIN:B003MZ63E2 Core Blu-ray]]\\")and written by Ann Biderman (\\"[[ASIN:B001NY4X4G Primal Fear (Hard Evidence Edition) [Blu-ray]]]) from the original screenplay by David Madsen, \\"Copycat\\" is engaging throughout even if some of its initial impact has been weakened by the \\"serial killer of the week\\" stuff that shows up on TV and in movies.<br /><br />The special features are a bit sparsh--we get Amiel giving us, at turns, a blow-by-blow description of what we're seeing, working with the cast, some of the script changes and long stretches of silence on occasion. When he's discussing working on the project it is a pretty engaging commentary but he certainly could have used a moderator and/or cast members with him to discuss the making of the film.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer looks good but not great which is a surprise given that the film isn't that old. There is a lack of depth to the images (improved depth is a hallmark of a good high def transfer)and a fair amount of video noise that crops up now and again. Over all the image quality is decent if a bit inconsistent.<br /><br />The lossless soundtrack packs punch and the 5.1 mix is particularly good during action sequences.<br /><br />The original theatrical trailer rounds out the special features. It's a pity we don't get a featurette or two from the writers discussing the origin of the script, changes that occurred between the script being purchased and produced as it would have been interesting to compare some of the changes that occurred.<br /><br />Although the image quality isn't as good as I would have liked (it appears to me that it might even be an older HD transfer)I'd generally recommended this if you can get it relatively inexpensively.images (improved depth is a hallmark of a good high def transfer)and a fair amount of video noise that crops up now and again.

B00447L4KA|5.0|I love watching this movie. Maybe because its a love story. Maybe because i remember watching it as a teen. Or because Heath reminds me of my husband when we were dating. This is a good movie for girl, boy, woman, or man to watch.
B000005RFQ|5.0|For those of you who have never heard this masterpiece, you are in for a real sonic treat by purchasing this CD.  Ian Gillian is a much better singer than Ozzy, and every bit as talented as Ronnie James Dio.  The songs on this album are as good as the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" CD, and a lot more fun.  \\"Trashed\\" as well as \\"Hot Line\\" and Digital Bitch\\" could stand up against the best of Sabbath if there wasn't such a bias toward Ozzy.  Don't get me wrong, Ozzy-era Sabbath was great, BUT Dio and Gillian era Sabbath was just as great (screw Sharon Osbourne).  And the Reading Festival live disc just proves how great Gillian was with Black Sabbath.  Not only could he sing his own Sabbath songs incredibly, BUT he sang the Ozzy songs better than Ozzy ever could live.  Do yourself a favor if you've never heard this album, put aside your Ozzy bias and listen to sonic power and grandeur of \\"Born Again\\" and the Gillian line up of Black Sabbath.  Cheers.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great app. Yes it works. You just have to do some leg work to find the links to get it working. Had a problem downloading videos. Followed some links and got it working.

B003ZMF26W|4.0|This mouse does have the functionality to back up its cool appearance. It's very comfortable and has a few nice features like being able to change your sensitivity with the press of a button, and multiple user profiles. Most the buttons can be remapped for different tasks, though the default options are typically the most useful. In addition to the normal 3 mouse buttons plus a back/forward button, it has a tactics, profile selection, rapid fire, macro, and 2 sensitivity buttons.    The design is the ergonomic curve that's become popular, but is a little more subtle. The appearance is very edgey, and can even be set to light up when clicking (looks pretty cool in FPS's to see it flash).    The software is a little trickier to figure out, namely when it comes to writing scripts and macros. As it appears, you can only store one macro per profile (which explains why only one button can be assigned as a macro button at a time) and can have up to 4 profiles, yet you can write multiple scripts (I believe up to 8 per profile) to do the same things as a macro, which are activated by a combination of the \\"Tactics\\" button and a mouse button. Given all that, though, the software for writing the programs is kinda hard to figure out and will take some trial and error.    This mouse is geared more toward use with MMORPGs but also works great for FPS's and RTS's. If you want something with high macro/programming capabilities, you might want to try another mouse instead, but if you only need basic programming or don't care for it at all, this is a great mouse.
0451219597|5.0|This is Ken Follett at his best.  Superb writing -- keeps you turning the pages.  A classic pitting of two formidable adversaries; somehow you want them both to triumph, even though it's obvious which one is good and which is evil.  Great story and wonderful supporting characters!
0439023513|2.0|I repeat, SPOILERS!    There were so many things about this book that disappointed me. But, I could overlook many of them if some sort of satisfactory conclusion was reached.     I could have handled:  -The throwaway death of Finnick and others.  -The impersonal, afterthought of an ending to the love triangle that dominated the series.  -The death of Prim, devastating as it was.  -Katniss spending half the book crying, whining, recovering, worsening, drugged, suicidal, etc.  -The irrelevance of Haymitch throughout.    If not for:  -The mission to reach Snow that failed to reach Snow. What a waste. All that sacrifice, for what? All those pages we had to read, for what? Yes, war is hell. We get it. Saving Private Ryan managed to convey to us that war is hell yet still, you know, save Private Ryan. A story is only as satisfactory as its ending. It's not the author's responsibility to give us the ending we want, but neither is it to waste so many pages on an ultimately meaningless journey.    -Everything that followed the arrow hitting Coin.  Katniss needed no further information on the circumstances surrounding Prim's death? A conspiracy of one murdered her sister? Okay. More drugged isolation? The \\"temporary insanity\\" defense in absentia? No words in her own defense? No rising to the occasion and ensuring that the new government was nothing like the old government? She just goes home to more sad isolation? Buttercup showed more courage and heart than Katniss.    The author had a lot of balls in the air by the end of this book and she managed to drop them all.

Also, it was a bit small for my gpu so I had to remove the top HD cage, which was easy with only a single thumbscrew but I wish I didn't have to.  Still, the case has more than enough hard drive mounts, so it won't really affect me.

1592802974|5.0|As the title indicates this book consists of a series of interviews with some of the best most successful traders in the world.<br /><br />Not only does this book cover a wide variety of trading techniques, it also covers a wide variety of markets as well (treasuries, futures, commodities etc.). The book also sheds light on the personal traits and characteristics of successful traders. By reading the different interviews one starts to see the commonalities but also the differentiators between them. It is very intriguing to read one very successful trader present opposite techniques than the next trader being interviewed.<br /><br />A must read for any serious investor. This book is filled with wisdom from start to finish - for both novice and advanced traders. One will also find that much of this wisdom applies to any career.<br /><br />Below are excerpts from this book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"You also have to follow your own light. Because I have so many friends who are talented traders, I often have to remind myself that if I try to trade their way, or on their ideas, I am going to lose. Every trader has strengths and weaknesses...As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. When you try to incorporate someone else's style, you often wind up with the worst of both styles. I've done that a lot.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"Don't ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"What are the traits of a successful trader? The most important is discipline - I am sure everyone tells you that. Second, you have to have patience; if you have a good trade on, you have to be able to stay with it. Third, you need courage to go into the market, and courage comes from adequate capitalization. Fourth, you must have a willingness to lose; that is also related to adequate capitalization. Fifth, you need a strong desire to win.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"I have two basic rules about winning in trading as well as in life: (1) If you don't bet, you can't win. (2) If you lose all your chips, you can't bet.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"The stock market is neither efficient nor random. It is not efficient because there are too many poorly conceived opinions; it is not random because strong investor emotions can create trends.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"I don't see how you can invest in American steel without understanding what is going on in Malaysian palm oil. As I explained before, it is all part of a big, three-dimensional puzzle that is always changing.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Although the styles of the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident:<br /><br />1- All those interviewed has a driving desire to become successful traders - in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goals.<br /><br />2- All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money.<br /><br />3- Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned.<br /><br />4- The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy.<br /><br />5- Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed.<br /><br />6- In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself.<br /><br />7- The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point.<br /><br />8- All top traders understand that losing is part of the game.<br /><br />9- They all love what they are doing.\\"as well as in life: (1) If you don't bet, you can't win.

0143034901|4.0|There are times where I didn't care for the book yet kept reading nonetheless. I suppose it's my inability to relate to characters that are 9,14 16 etc. When he turns 16 and then on I liked the story more. It certainly takes some twist and keeps the reader engaged. Even when I figured out who was who I still really enjoyed the book. Even when I lost interest, I still feverishly read through the rest of the book.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I got the free version from the other app market, which might be why my scores appear to not have transferred to this paid version. Pretty much my only real complaint about this app, and not a big one since I&apos;ll just replay those levels again.\n\nSince there is a free version, stop reading reviews and try it out! This is great for free app of the day, well worth a dollar they&apos;re asking, and actually worth the two dollars in the other place.\n\nOh, and Amazon, delete the reviews where idiots post one star reviews when they haven&apos;t even tried the app. Shame on you for not weeding those out already.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|My friend ordered seasons 1-3, so I started watching it with her & fell in love with it.  After a couple weeks, I decided to just buy it myself!  It has a great story-line, characters & plenty of quotes you'll be repeating & laughing at later!  My only complaint is all the sex/nudity...  Everything is so sexually charged these days, & it's so unnecessary.  But it is an HBO show, so what else can you expect?!  lol<br /><br />Anyway, it's a great show, & I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in fantasy-like characters & plots with a few real-life occurrences.  (Names of celebrities, the war, etc...)
B0052VUNHC|3.0|The first half was pretty good, the last half not so much, I ended up skimming the last 20 or 30 pages. Once Abby and Travis got together, the plot for driving them apart and back together was contrived, I tired of all the different nicknames she had, some of the plot devices were a little beyond my ability to suspend disbelief, and by the end I didn't care much anymore whether Travis f*ing loved her or not, my best hope for him was anger management. Giving it three stars - four for the first half and two for the second.
B0041D843M|5.0|Had I read this much earlier in life and taken it to heart I would probably not have just finished Chemo and Radiation for Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. As a cancer survivor, I can tell you that honestly I would probably have blown this information off a few years ago. You don't think that you can get sick until it actually happens to you. My hope is that people will read this and use the information contained today. It can happen to you. It does not have to happen to you.        As you can tell from the description of the book and the reviews, this book is about how our diet makes us sick. The author controlled tumors in a scientific setting by controlling the amount of specific proteins the test subjects received. Illness after illness could be controlled or improved by the removal of these  proteins from the diet. Yes, I am talking Vegan.          After getting sick I started doing my research. In book after book I read change your diet. My Chemo doctor, radiation doctor,  and my heart doctor were all unconcerned about diet. So I was not too impressed by the numerous people saying change your diet because they offered no proof. Then I found this book. This book is the Bible of the Vegan world. It does not tell you how to be Vegan; it just tells you why to do it. It is repetitious in that he states the same thing over and over \\"Change your diet\\". But I believe that people need to hear it.    All in all, I cannot say enough about this book. I really hope that people read it and give the ideas in it a chance. We all know that what we are doing now in the USA is not making us healthier. There is a better way, and this book explains how you can make your life and health better by taking a few small steps. Trust me, it is a lot easier going Vegan than it is to go to chemo.    As a side note, I live in Colorado. Colorado is the only state in the nation that makes it a crime to disparage food. I would love to be more specific in this review, but it appears that they could throw me in jail because of the Colorado Food-Libel Laws (look it up if you don't believe me).  Since I am not a lawyer and don't know the laws well, I have tried to keep this review very general. Perhaps this is why Vegan's are treated as weird; because there are laws against saying otherwise.

I have mine set up so that I have to solve 5 math problems to wake up, which is great because, in the past, I would wake up and dismiss other alarms without even realizing what I was doing.

B00122PJ74|5.0|Blues For The Red Sun is the second studio album by the legendary stoner/desert rock band Kyuss, it has went on to become an absolute classic of the genre and is one of the most influential and well loved records in the entire movement since it was released in 1992.<br /><br />Blues For The Red Sun contains a lot of the band's most famous material such as `Green,' `Thong Song,' `Thumb,' and `Mondo Generator,' and Kyuss's lineup features Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri, Brant Bjork and John Garcia all of whom have become synonymous with interesting and creative music.<br /><br />The album famously features the technique of playing guitars through bass amplifiers for a unique sounding distortion and the entire scope of musicianship is really impressive with creative techniques and unique ways of playing that many would go on to imitate but few would ever be able to surpass. The quality of songwriting is hugely consistent and the album flows perfectly from beginning to end in a brilliantly hypnotic fashion. There are no weak moments, no track is out of place and no note is wasted.<br /><br />Overall, Blues For The Red Sun is an utterly essential album that no Kyuss fan should be without and that every fan of creative and interesting rock and metal music should give serious consideration to trying out. A true classic record.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|I only paid $15 for this so it was a decent buy for me.  There were 13 \\"hour long\\" episodes.  If you liked the X-files, you might enjoy this one.  I found it to be a less serious, modern version of the X-files.  The characters are likeable, especially Duke.  Even my husband was complaining when there was an episode where they didn't include Duke in.  However, I have a feeling the show won't last long.  I don't see how they'll keep it going because the story is mostly centered around the Lucy, the main character and why she came to Haven in the first place.  It's an odd one ( Fringe meets the X-files and hangs out with Eureka at some cute little town in Maine ).  It was a fun show with some unique \\"cases\\" that I never really got to see from other shows.

B004Z4LZ7E|1.0|I was very happy to acquire this book for a gift, images and content are astonishing! However, it was disappointing to open it and discover the pages were so poorly glued that some of them started to fell of the cover.  I read it was \\"bargain\\" and its said those books are in equal quality from normal titles but now I see that's also a lie.
B005D6731U|5.0|The introduction of Julia Stiles character Lumen was woven into Dexter's life seamlessly - even though I knew she would be in this season.  I didn't expect her to be the victim that Dexter finds along his journey.  Lumen is the perfect blend of vulnerable & survivor that seems to compliment Dexter very well.<br />He seems to be in a place where he not only helps out another but this person seems to help him in return cope with Rita's murder.<br />Going against Harry's code & following his own gut is a struggle that you watch play out throughout this season.  Dexter is not as \\"perfect\\" as he is when working alone as Harry taught him, but in this new vein you see him be even less of the monster he's thought himself to be his entire life.<br />This season doesn't disappoint!! Watching Dexter's character move forward from Rita's murder - I wonder how the writers could accomplish such a fate, but they have made another season of Dexter to be gripping & enduring!<br />A MUST SEE!! (as always!)
B004YEJGEO|5.0|So far Im very happy with this game. A nice relaxed puzzle game that I can play for a few minutes at a time. Havving lots of customization options as well is a nice touch.
B005D66AZA|5.0|Again, I cannot praise this show enough!!!<br />Season 5 doesn't disappoint!!<br />One of the things I fell in love with on this show is the writer's ability to make Dexter ..... well, Dexter & yet see a softie underneath & still also see the steely nerves that can kill without a second thought.  You can watch Michael C. Hall's character try & try again to learn how to care about others besides himself.  When a friend asks me to describe the show I tend to struggle because it's SO hard to describe how one might find a serial killer endearing.  You watch him evolve as a person, a man, a Dad and so much more.  Dealing with feelings of grief & teenagers to a serial killer would seem so difficult to show on the screen & yet the show does it flawlessly!<br />I love this show!<br />I jump from episode to episode more hungry for the next!<br />Highly recommend this show!
0553801473|2.0|Does anyone have a clue as to where this series is going?  Martin seems to be mired in a morass of his own making.  He's going nowhere and taking an eternity to get wherever nowhere is.  The cliff-hangers are getting stale, the characters are becoming less and less engaging, and I'm at the point where I don't even care how the series ends any more.  Martin needs to do everyone a favor and wrap the whole thing up once and for all.  But from the way this series is creeping on and on and on, I have a sinking feeling the ending is going to be less of a bang than a whimper.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B005D66DOI|5.0|With respect to the previous person the wrote a poor review of this episode & comments of season 5 of Dexter - I couldn't disagree more!<br />On course season 5 is going to differ from season 1...wouldn't it be boring if it were the same?  For me, the evolution of Dexter from being/working/living alone (even withdrawing at times so that \\"others\\" don't get in his way of his killing) to a character that finds himself at times wanting to be closer to people is what makes this season even more interesting.  As a viewer, I saw him fall in love with Rita & blend with her family.  They even created another life - Harrison.  Now, without Rita - Dexter is learning how to be a single Dad without his anchor in the strange life of thinking of others.<br />It's this attempt to find some sort of balance between his many hats that continue to make this serial killer even more - human.  He does start making mistakes, but it shows that he is more like other people than heonce thought.<br />I highly recommend this season of Dexter just as highly as I would the previous seasons.<br />Dexter is a character that I find incedibly complex...so many sides to him that unfold with each season.  The show is never stale or lacking in intrigue!
B004IFYN2E|4.0|Angelina Jolie is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. Johnny Depp is funny and corky. The art direction is beautiful. I didn't care too much for the plot, but it's still a good movie for me
B005D63LL6|5.0|I never imagined I of all people would be a Dexter fan!<br />The reason I write this is because I've never been a fan of horror movies & am not that great watching blood & guts....in fact, I most avoid both of these!!<br />But, a close friend kept raving about Dexter & I gave the show a shot.<br />Even at Season 5 - when most shows start to lose steam & sometimes viewers - I am still glued to the screen & always left wanting more Dexter!<br />I was wondering how Season 5 would handled (having to change this due to people watching season's out of order) - the drama with Rita & I feel like they did an awesome job!<br />I promise Season 5 will not disappoint the die hard Dexter fan!<br />Or, even if you are a first time viewer....you will quickly become a fan! (Although, I highly recommend watching Dexter in all its glory from the very beginning - Season 1-5!)<br />Season 6 can't come fast enough since I don't subscribe to Showtime!
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|For some reason I was under the impression that the soundtrack would actually have music from the movie on it. Like the duet of Give In To Me, it is a single by Faith Hill, not the duet from the movie, which I liked MUCH better. I guess I was being naive thinking there would actually be the more songs from the movie, since it was the movie's soundtrack!

0553386794|4.0|One thing I won't do in this \\"review\\" is list, or rather reiterate, the pros and cons of this work of literature;  MISTER SJEM \\"sonofhotpie\\" has done a well enough job of that already. Instead, I will warn other readers mainly about the dark philosophy and heavy pornography of this book, with some my own views on the sex, along with a heavy dose of underlying cynicism that laughs in the face of chivalry and religious doctrine.<br /><br />First off, I would like to warn Tolkien fans that this is no book of brave men and high elves with mythical swords fighting the foul orcs and mad wizards of Middle Earth. In fact, there are even no clear antagonists nor protagonists in the entirety of the novel, and black and white morals are mixed in an apathetic grey area defined by the philosophy of Realpolitik. This book jests at the truly pious and wicked men, making them mere cardboard characters beside the cunning and the ambitious. Its underlying message seem to say that real wars are fought in the bedroom and behind closed doors, not out on the battlefield. This book is a possible analogy to modern politics.<br /><br />To the parents; this book is so sinful and vile and truthful that no child could ever read it with getting lifelong scars. Child pornography, whorehouses, and homosexuality are in this book, with the first two fairly often and in explicit detail. This is no Ranger's Apprentice, I Am Number Four, or Twilight, the stereotypically shallow books that have come to define the teenage Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre. This is as explicit as the sex slave trafficking in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br />However \\"deep\\" and real this may be, I do have some problems with it. I understand that the author Martin is trying make the real, cruel world stand out and slap us Bourgeoisie  in the face, but perhaps he overdid it to a point where we can no longer relate to it, and it becomes as shallow as any pornographic video. Scenes of poor adolescent blondes being gang raped are reduced to lustful mental images that give erections to male readers, horror to female ones, and more cash to the writer.<br /><br />In short, this book is not a High Fantasy novel of the norm, but rather a heavily callous story that only the deepest and most cynical of readers can enjoy. If you want to keep your virginity or want to read a good action novel, this is NOT for you. This book is about as brutal and morbid as an Fantasy/Sci-Fi novel can be, surpassing even the novels of the Black Library, and so probably will remain as controversial as any great classic should be.l mental images that give erections to male readers, horror to female ones, and more cash to the writer.

1932907009|5.0|Please bear with me... First, some background: in 1985, I participated in a year-long seminar conducted by Syd Field the \\"Dean\\" of screen-writing teachers - maybe even literally since he's currently on the faculty at USC's film program. In any case, I didn't continue with writing for the screen. As my wife said at the time, \\"You've got kids to feed...right now.\\" Suffice it to say she didn't buy into the dream. Flash forward (as they say) to a few years ago and my eldest wants to go to Film School. I drew the short straw (really, my wife didn't want to go) and accompanied him on a number of tours of Southern California film programs. The experience reignited my interest in screenwriting. My son recently graduated and his recommendation for a manual on screenwriting was Save The Cat. The subject came up because I just completed a refresher course on screenwriting, which also re-enforced the maxims in the Blake Snyder book. I say \\"maxims\\" because Snyder is emphatic that his insights, method and road map are all one needs to crack the code of Hollywood screenwriting. BTW - Snyder tips his hat to Syd Field, which is not insignificant since Snyder is otherwise dismissive of screenwriting books and gurus. Snyder's book a quick read, has lots of examples and a killer \\"beat sheet.\\" I'm half-way through my 3rd script - you need 3-4 scripts before you start knocking on Hollywood's door - so we'll see...
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Fun game,  runs great and the dev continues to actively support it.  Terrific free app of the day but I will go buy it from the Market as Amazon doesn&apos;t actually pay devs anything for the free app of the day,  despite saying they give 20%...
B004OR1X6A|5.0|As usual.  Rory is just great.  Yes, some of the same material, but always fresh, the same as seeing him perform live.  One of the truely greats of all-time. Relatively unknown, when the reality is, he should be iconic for his time.

B004YEJGEO|5.0|My first reaction when I saw that this was the free app for today was, &quot;Dang, I just paid for this app last week.&quot; Then I came to my senses and realized that I&apos;ve been enjoying this game for a week longer than most people here. Well worth the 99 cents. \n\nKudos to the makers of this app. I&apos;m glad to support developers that make quality apps like this one.\n\nI do wish there was a built-in leaderboard so I could compare my scores against others. And the prisims sometimes don&apos;t combine the lasers right, and I have to delete it and drop a new one. But the developer seems to be actively fixing problems, so I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll be fixed soon.
0553573403|2.0|The good: Martin can write, when he puts himself to it. He can even let characters emerge from their actions without explaining everything to death. His world-building is often pretty solid, to the point where the unexplained bits feel like watching Blade Runner without the bloody narrator: you're fascinated and want to know more, longing for a deeper understanding and willing to wait or work more for your rewards. Chapter headings bear the name of the character whose viewpoint is followed in them: That makes for some interesting and insightful switching of points of view. Some cliffhangers are well played out: when the book picks them up again, the story has moved on enough that you are on edge, waiting for the writer to reveal you what the hell's happened, especially if the plotline is picked up through another characters' eyes.<br />The bad: The good stops after 200 pages and occasionally resumes about 500 pages later. I'm perplexed to read Stephen Donaldson calling himself a notorious over-writer, whereas Martin and Jordan (to name but those I've read) get away with writing these monsters which could have been summed up in a quarter if the space, as they are little more than a collection of plot twists, with mercifully short chapters that read like Dragonball anime episodes: 25 minutes of smoke screen for one lonely bit if info. If you do not care for a character and his/her story are fairly detached from the rest (Jon and Danerys), reading through them is often a pain: you'll wish the writer had cut some chapters, or he'd saved some for another book, or a spin-off for completists.<br />The ugly: this whole book doesn't really sound like anything new, in part because it's a trite novelized vision of gruesome middle ages and mostly because it's really uselessly long. Insane lists of useless names are not good world-building, they're pretension, for example. Tolkien saved those mostly for appendixes or satirical purposes. Forget humour in this book by the way: Characters may joke or occasionally do funny things for rare comedic purposes, but this book takes itself way too seriously. Back cover quotes for this books usually compare them favourably against Tolkien: That's such a load of crap. Tolkien's good because the background work was so deep and consistent, by the time he sat down to write the Lord Of The Rings, he achieved more as a writer in a thousand odd pages than Martin will have achieved when the seventh and last book will be out making The Song Of Fire And Ice around 600 boring pages long...). Tolkien also had the decency to let the process out until his son dragged his corpse out of the grave (happy as I am to have been able to read the Silmarillion and more, I recognise tomb-raiding when I see it), while Martin just throws everything at you at once. I bet the cutting floor is spotless. If you value quantity over quality though, my complaints will be your praise. Also: if you want to see intelligent woman characters, open another book. If you wasn't to see a positive depiction of sex: open another book. Rape and whoring abound, and much as I value realism and mature themes (this is after all revised middle age \\"history\\"), much as I'd like somebody to drag fantasy out of the Harry Potter hole, this is not it. Realistic politics play a big role in the book; however, some characters still act so dumbly (for overdone sense of honour or inexplicable stupidity) that it all loses strength and credibility. Eddard and Catelyn are despicable in this respect, the latter is am especially insufferable person. Buy they're both honest to the point of seeming gullible against all reason, and Catelyn goes as far as showing, at some point, some incredible pacifism that is so badly portrayed, it totally makes a god thing look bad! My personal dislike of many characters aside, I guess my main complain, though, is that none of them feels believable, even within the necessarily stretched credibility of a fantasy novel. They are occasionally relatable, but mostly just superfially created characters.<br />Closing comments: I eventually was enthused enough by the plot that I might read book 2 some day (after having read Ghormenghast and at least 2 more Donaldson and Mieville books...): if that also fails to give me some sense of achievement, that's totally it, I'm over my brief falling in with unending fantasy epics.<br />January 2012 update: On second thought, I don't believe I'll ever pick up this series again. Seriously, there's too much better stuff to lose time over this.relatable, but mostly just superfially created characters.

B004VFYPTW|4.0|This is quite good for a live show; it makes all of us who are old enough to have been there, wish we were.
0446402397|4.0|I would have given this book five stars but for a coincidental ending (which I won't spoil by giving away), that struck me as pure Hollywood calling: 'Get all the characters to intertwine in some way.' It's probably no surprise then that Tom Rob Smith earned his writing spurs writing screenplays, and this book was snapped up early for a film treatment by no less than Ridley Scott.     What works the best in this book is the way in which everyone serves Stalin's party machine in some form: it permeates reactions to the boys' deaths (based on a true life series of murders), the overall investigation, and how work mates, relatives and partners interact.     Particularly moving was how the main character, state investigator Leo Demitov is unsure at one point whether to betray his wife in order to save his own and his parent's neck. His wife in turn lies to escape the fate he might decide for her, and both are left questioning whether any semblance of love was their mutual attraction, or was it just more state-position power-brokering: he was attracted to her because she was a teacher and intellectual which would look good to his superiors; and she was attracted to him because the power of his position might protect her.    In the end it's fear and survival which binds them - probably as close to love as can be clung to in the stifling state-controlled atmosphere portrayed in this gripping thriller. Put it high on your reading list.
B000001GX8|5.0|I inherited this CD when my father passed away and it's PERFECT. I wished I could have discovered it before he died so I could have squee'd about it with him. Anyway, everyone's voices are SPOT ON -- hardly any fudged notes, there is rhythmic and technical perfection and an exciting and emotional performance from everyone, even little Barbarina.<br /><br />Almaviva is fantastically versatile, taking you from longingly horny (with Susanna) to angrily jealous (with Rosina) and everything in between. Figaro is hilarious! Cherubino has a really fascinating voice with lots of really tight vibrato. When the characters laugh, you believe them. When Rosina declares her despair in her second big aria you really feel everything she's going through. The orchestra is perfect as well. I have no problem with any of the tempos.<br /><br />Anyway, to make a long story short, BUY THIS RECORDING. kthx.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|The game is pretty fun and so far from what I can tell it is kinda like the puzzles used to open crates in Gameloft&apos;s Nova. Now I have a rooted htc EVO with cm7.0.3.1(if you don&apos;t know what that is well maybe google it and find out it&apos;s way cool :-)) and the game runs smoothly and has clean graphics.  As for if it runs good on other high end phones or any Android device for that matter I have no idea there are to many contributing factors. But I don&apos;t pretend to know like the guy who claims he is &quot;smarter than the average android user&quot; poor guy
B005EU4QBU|5.0|First off, when this album was released I didn't really like it at first but then it grew on me, like most of Arcade Fire's stuff. Now I really like this album. It's very good and the 2 new songs and videos are totally worth it, although if you go to Arcade Fire's official website, you can buy the whole thing directly from them WITH the videos for only $4.50 so I recommend getting it there. Otherwise this is awesome.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie! It shipped super fast and it plays perfectly. No problems thus far. I love getting awesome movies for awesome prices. I'd recommend this movie and shipper.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Anyone giving this DVD 5 or 4 stars is delusional.    These guys are phoning it in.  They seem they'd rather be sitting on the couch watching Seinfeld reruns than performing.  About as emotionless a performance as you can imagine - why bother going to a concert (or buying this DVD) if this is the best they can do?  You can tell this all about raking in the $$ and nothing more. Glad I didn't pay for this.    That said, a competent performance, if lifeless - almost everyone sits in their seats the entire concert.  They seem to think the animation and light show make a concert.  But I guess what else can you really expect from geriatrics on stage, performing the same songs for the 10,000th time?
1400052181|4.0|I'm enjoying this book tremendously but would have enjoyed it a lot more if the publisher had included the pictures in the Kindle version.

The truths he espouses are embarrassingly obvious once we understand them; now, we just need to remember and live them and life will have so much more meaning for us!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Is it just me or are some of these super hard? Good game though. Wish they offered better hints. Twenty.
B004GGM444|4.0|I love this album, and no doubt I will buy the physical album. I wish instead I did that first instead of downloading the MP3's. It is convenient, but as the consumer I expect the product to be at it's highest quality. I have an excellent pair of headphones and listening at 256 kbs just doesn't cut it. Highly disappointed that I was not given 320 kbs. The bitrate should be part of the the album description, it definitely would have made my decision to go for the CD for the same price + shipping.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|It's another ordinary day in Japan...until, for reasons unknown, the corpses of the recently-decease suddenly rise up and start attacking people!     Despite the title, only the first two episodes take place in the school. After that, the six main characters escape and try to find safe haven anywhere they can. (They also escape the school with a teacher and several other students in a bus, but the teacher turns out to be a power-mad wanna-be dictator of sorts who turns the surviving students into his own little cult, so the main characters-five students and the school nurse-separate from that group and try to make it on their own.)    If you've seen American zombie movies it's pretty obvious this show was STRONGLY influenced by them. The same rules that went for most flesh-eating zombie films apply here as well: If a zombie bites you, you become one of them, and the only way to kill a zombie is to shoot or stab it in the head, killing it's brain. I also noticed at the very beginning what seemed to be a direct nod to the recent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, when army helicopters pass over the heads of two of the lead characters when they're on the roof of the school building, but don't stop to help them.     As the Amazon reviewer noted, we don't get any explanation as to why exactly the dead have risen and are attacking people. However the same thing is true for alot of \\"killer zombie\\" films. (The above-mentioned DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, the 1990 NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake, DIARY OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, ect.) Also this is based on a manga series and it only covers roughly one half of the manga, so it's possible they just might later in the manga give an explanation.     And of course, because it's Japanese anime, there's tons of fanservice. Enjoy!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge. a really unique puzzle game that requires a bit of patients to figure out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|From the simple yet attractive opening screen to the subtle yet soothing soundtrack &quot;quell&quot; has an extremely polished feel.  The app (on a Samsung Galaxy S) runs flawlessly.  The most favorable feature is, despite the quality graphics and sound, the game loads fast enough for a momentary diversion but packs enough content for a focused gaming session.  \n\nTwo features that could contribute more would be level editing capability and an expanded game area.
B001AQO400|5.0|I love this movie!  The storytelling is heartfelt and the acting is superb.  My wife and I love to rewatch this every year as it is one of her favorites too.  Also love how Tokyo and outlying areas were used as a backdrop to show the beauty of the country and alienation the principals felt from the very different culture, customs, and language.  It mirrored the lack of meaningful connection they felt for their significant others.  The ending was pitch-perfect leaving the viewer to fill in their own specifics.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|So my girl is back with another chart topper-<br />Girls who run the world.... HATED IT, until I saw the video.... the choreography is amazing<br /><br />I have to admit... my FAVORITE songs she released on this project are actually on the bonus CD that was sold exclusively at Target.<br /><br />Lay up under Me<br />School'n Life***<br />Dance For you<br /><br />Now had she actually put these songs on the Main release and left off a few other's (Girls, I am Here) it would've been PERFECT.<br />I give her a 5 because I Love her and quite frankly she could sing her A,B,C's to me 24 hours a day and I would still be entertained. The only downfall to the Bonus CD is the other mixed versions of \\"Girls\\", I would've preferred the remix to get me bodied (Move ur body) for the Michelle Obama fitness campaign (very fun song).<br /><br />But the whole album has grown on me now and I cant stop listening to it... worth the buy if ur a Beyonce fan
B004E0Z4XK|4.0|Kind of weary when I heard this was coming out . Initially decided not to buy but changed my mind when I heard Jack White's 2 against 1 . Really like that track . Enjoy the   western music too. You can't help but envision Clint Eastwood. The music suggests scenes from Cowboy Movies , especially the Man with no Name. The music also borrows from The Moody Blues and   Pink Floyd at times ( some small pieces - not the majority ) . I put this on for the first time today while in the car and it was great driving music . If you want some relaxing new music , you may like this . Give it a shot .
B004YEJGEO|4.0|I&apos;ve only completed the first 8 levels but can tell already that this game is going to be one of my favorites. The interface on the game field is pretty easy to use once you figure out how to adjust the prism output angles (tap the prism to choose between the 2 outputs -the highlighted beam is the one you&apos;re currently modifying - then you can change the direction of the beam).  The overall interface could use a couple of tweaks for easier navigation, but certainly nothing I can&apos;t live with. In a nutshell, great game with lots of long-term playing potential. I don&apos;t see getting bored with this one any time soon.\n\nP.S. - great price, too!
B001G9FFM2|5.0|I never heard Machine Head before \\"The Blackening\\", but once i heard this album, I became an instant fan. This album is by far in the top 5 of the best albums ever produced. Machine Head said they were aiming to create this generation's Master of Puppets, and in my opinion they surpassed their goal. Each song has intelligent lyrics which explain their emotions about the world. Rob Flynn's voice is phenomenal, especially in \\"A Farewell To Arms\\". I bought the original album because it was the only version available at the music store. Then i saw the Special Edition here on Amazon and just had to get it. Great album along with 2 bonus tracks, both covers: one of Metallica's Battery and the other of Maiden's Hallowed Be Thy Name. It comes with a bonus dvd which is totally worth it. A good bit of live footage, music videos, and the making of. Incredible album all together. I recommend this to anyone looking for unique, crushing music with amazing vocals. I would also recommend Machine Head's album \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\", Metallica's album \\"And Justice For All\\", Kamelot's \\"The Black Halo, Epica's \\"Design Your Universe\\", and Jeff Loomis instrumental album \\"Zero Order Phase\\"
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|She seems to still have a childs mind in so many ways.  My heart goes out to her for all she went through.  I wish the book would have been longer & gone into the mind of Phillip & why he did what he did.  She explains some, but not all.  You know after 18 years she had to know that man inside & out.  I know he's a sick man, but how many people actually survive what she went through?  I'm sure the statistics are very low.  The book was great, but still leaves me curious in so many ways.
0553386794|3.0|From the reviews I can see that GOT has very committed fans, but don't count me among them. It's not that the book is too long.  It's not that the book has too many characters.  It's that much of the book is boring, several of the characters are cliches, and the political intrigue and battles are been there done that.<br />The idea of the Wall and the Night's Watch is original and interesting - those characters are compelling, especially Jon Snow.  Tyrion Lannister is also a fully realized character, complex and real.  And the quasi-Mongol hoard Dothraki are interesting, but the whole Daenerys goes from frightened girl to suckling dragons is eye-rolling bad.<br />And the author ought to either stick to familiar names and titles or make up new ones.  Calling the Khan the Khal and Sir rendered as Ser is stupid.<br />I was looking forward to immersing myself in all five volumes, but I won't bother with the next four because, frankly, I don't care what happens to most of these characters or their world.  I don't have HBO but the previews LOOK good, so maybe when the DVDs come out on Netfkix and I have a blank weekend I'll watch.  If I am not immersed in a a better book.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a game with a simple premise, and a lot of creativity and variety aroung the premise. Makes for great fun, playable for short spurts or long periods. The only surprising thing that I&apos;m still not sure about is that a higher score is given for using more (excessive) objects instead of the fewest and shortest distance.
0439023483|5.0|It is a young adult book in the same way that Harry Potter is only for young adults.     The hero is an impulsive, doubting 17 year old girl in so far over her head, it is almost impossible to imagine.  She is also kind, loyal and smart.  Like life, things don't work out perfectly in the end, but the characters learn valuable lessons along the way.       I think the book (actually it's a trilogy) will become a classic for young (and old readers) and it stacks up well to other in the genre like Catcher in the Rye, Tom Sawyer, 1984, Brave New World, Dune and Harry Potter.  Sure as Steven King says there are some plot holes and other portions ripped off from a long list of other books especially Battle Royale, but \\"Reading The Hunger Games is as addictive (and as violently simple) as playing one of those shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.\\"    The compelling nature does fall off in the substantially weaker Volume III, but that is partly why I like the books so much.  The Trilogy, like life may not have a perfect and uplifting happy ending, but our efforts to continue and affirm it, may be all we can do, may be all that need, and may be all we can get.      Imagine a combination of Survivor, Escape from New York, the Lottery and the Most Dangerous Game.  It's a compelling read.     I highly recommend it.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I have not tried to use this with a CF card reader.  However, I have used it with my SD cards extensively, and it works very well for that.  If you insert the SD connector into the iPad and go to photos, the iPad will ask you if you wish to import the photos.  My big 16MB photos import very quickly, so it does work well.  This is what I bought it for so I am basically satisfied.<br /><br />Others have complained about problems hooking up USB devices, such as CF card readers, to the USB interface.  I will try this later and update this review accordingly.<br /><br />One nit: the iPad interface plug on the SD interface device is shaped such that I must remove my plastic iPad case in order to insert it all the way.  It requires space on both sides of the female connector on the iPad to be inserted all the way.  I wish that they had not done this.<br /><br />Does the job, albeit imperfectly.  It really is handy to have the SD card reader after a day of shooting.  The iPad is a wonderful way to review photos.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I needed a Digital to Analog converter for the coax output of my office PC and this fit the bill perfectly. I am using an older Harman Kardon integrated amp (PM665vxi) which of course does not have a digital input, and this little unit sounds great with it. It sounds just as good, although different, as the Nuforce uDAC2 which cost $100 more. The D3 is a bit more detailed IMO than the uDAC2. I can't speak for the reliability of the unit yet, but it seems well made for $29. I have also used the optical input of the unit with a Behringer UCA202 and it sounded great. I highly recommend this unit if you are looking for an inexpensive DAC and have space limitations.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital is a well-written guide for the new or experience indie writer/publisher. The book covers everything from money to book formatting to marketing possibilities. Even with my background as an indie writer, I picked up several valuable tips and was inspired by the profiles of successful indie writers that Gaughran included at the back of the book. This is simply the best book about the ebook revolution that I have read.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|Let me start with the only problem I have with these headphones, but it's a BIG problem.  Sitting on a couch 8 feet away from the transmitter I had almost constant pops and crackles.  And these aren't just quiet pops, they actually hurt my ears even when the volume was low.  The interference is probably due to other devices in the house on the same frequency and I tried to resolve that but it never worked.  I had to return them.<br /><br />However, if you don't get this interference you might love these.  The build quality was pretty good, they're lightweight, and the sound is decent.  Not the best in the world but great for a non-audiophile.<br /><br />I decided to go with the Razer Chimaera RZ04-00480100-R3U1 5.1 Gaming Headset.  It runs at 5.8 GHz so I get zero interference.  A little more expensive but a great headset.
1416550550|4.0|The prose is often thoughtful and pretty.  I love the fairy tale themes/metaphors.  The mystery was fairly well done.    The book does have its disappointments, however. I found myself interested in characters that did not receive enough attention(Nell, Cass, Linus).  They certainly had quirks and backstory, and providing these characters a larger role would have increased my enjoyment of the work substantially.  I wanted the three time periods to all be equally interesting but instead it was the plot of the early 1900s that stole all the drama and so the pacing was a little bit off.  Also a few absurdly corny cliches/plot-devices hurt.  There's a very lousy romance that feels so contrived it made me sour --(quick spoiler but this plot thread is so insignificant and poorly done it wont wreck the enjoyment of the novel) A handsome, single man who happened to do some construction work on Cass' new property and, oh my, loves fairly tales just as much as she!!  I would have been more interested in her past marriage and child then seeing that corny, weak plotline forced into the story.  Fortunately, there are other relationships far more complex and interesting.    Ultimately, a very enjoyable read.  I look forward to seeing how Kate Morton's style evolves as she continues to write.  If she can prevent herself from tossing tawdry plot devices into her story, she'll be absolutely amazing.
0545123275|5.0|I enjoyed Shiver so much! It's the YA paranormal romance book that comes through for you, unlike Twilight. The characters were realistic (plus, the teenagers seemed very normal and acted like regular high schoolers, except for Sam). The werewolves were definitely unique compared to wolves in other books and movies. The plotline was good, and it didn't include the typical fight/war scene or enemy that has become a little too common in most paranormal books.<br /><br />Grace has always been fascinated by the wolves that live in the woods behind her house. She hates when they disappear for the summer. When she was eleven, she was attacked by those wolves, and one of them saved her. Ever since then, the yellow-eyed wolf has always been \\"her\\" wolf, and seemed to always watch over her. But then the wolves attack Jack Culpeper, who is the typical rich, snobbish jerk at school. He died, but then his body disappeared. One day while Grace is out in the woods she hears him yell out, and then finds a new wolf in the pack. And as hunters try to kill off the wolves for killing Jack, Grace discovers Sam, naked and with a bullet in his neck from the hunters. She takes him to the ER, and it soon becomes apparent that he is her yellow-eyed wolf. The werewolves are wolves when it is cold and humans when it is warm, but each year they need more warmth to transform back into humans. Eventually they stop turning back, and this is probably Sam's final year to be human.<br /><br />The idea for the wolves being human when it is hot out was a great idea. Not only is it original, it also set the stage for one of the biggest conflicts in the story: Sam changing back into a wolf for life. He has to fight to stay human. There were a couple weird parts about changing, especially when another werewolf goes out into the cold and doesn't change. He seems to be even more sensitive to the cold than Sam, as he couldn't even open the front door from it being too cold. The wolves' minds are also different than the humans. They have some problems remembering stuff from their human lives, and vice versa. Their means of communications is sharing mental pictures. It sounds a bit like Twilight, I know, but there are limitations. No abstract ideas and no names. Instead, there are instincts that don't even allow Grace to get close to Sam.<br /><br />Grace was also bitten by the werewolves, but she has never transformed. It at first sounded like there was a quirk with her, almost like (again, Twilight, I'm sorry) Edward not being able to read Bella's mind. There's a possibility that it's not quite like that.<br /><br />The people seem mostly normal, for the most part. Grace's eccentric painter of a mother is always busy, and her father is always out. She has to fend for herself and manages to keep a guy in her house for days without them realizing. It's a little unrealistic, in my opinion, and also slightly overdone. Grace's friends are very normal together- they aren't always sure what to do, they have a couple fights between each other, and so on. Sometimes they are a little crazy and hyper. They need coffee. And so on. Sam and the pack are all a little different because of their different lifestyle. He grew up being homeschooled in the summer, when he was human, and most of his interactions were with other werewolves. Sam enjoys language and words because for a large part of his time, he can't use them, but he will make up little poems or song lyrics. I'm a bit of a poet myself, and unfortunately you can't just come up with good, rhyming lyrics off the top of your head like he seems to do. It takes a little bit of time to write the four lines with all of the right phrasing and sounds. One of the most minor details in the book that I didn't enjoy. Sam and Grace seem normal most of the time, but at times it becomes obvious that Grace is quiet and doesn't like a lot of people while Sam is almost a little too sensitive, bordering on emo or being a loner or something. I likethis quality about them- they seem relatable while still being themselves. The facts that the two of them have \\"known\\" each other for years and that Grace actually has friends and fits in somewhere are pluses in the book. There are just too many stories where the new girl meets the supernatural boy and they end up together.<br /><br />I enjoyed one part of the story where Sam is reading a bit of German poetry to Grace, because of how it sounds. While reading the translation, he breaks off and says that he doesn't like this translation. Because I know German, it was interesting because I know exactly what it meant. I feel like there would be a difference in how you take that scene and interpret it based on whether you know the language or not and if you understand the whole quote.<br /><br />I would have to say, try this book. If you liked Twilight, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like Twilight because of the annoying characters, you'll enjoy this. If you thought the vampires were a little too tame in Twilight, you'll enjoy this. If you found Stephanie Meyer's lack of mentioning one specific topic that comes up in all too many YA and adult books childish and naive, you'll enjoy this (I'd say that this is on the same level as The Vampire Diaries TV series on that subject, so if you're ready for a book a little more mature than Twilight or have seen the series, you'll be fine). If you haven't read Twilight because you were told what a lousy book it was or didn't want to get caught up in the craze, you'll most likely enjoy this book. If you haven't read Twilight because it looked too long, you should try this book (at 390 pages, it is very manageable).eem relatable while still being themselves.

1400079144|3.0|This latest book by Dan Brown was merely okay. Though parts of it did capture me, it was nothing like the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. I don't know, maybe Brown was just in it for the money this time, because the 'spark' just wasn't there.    I wish I could say better about this book and I hope that his next effort will be better.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|My cousins watched this movie in theater, and they all agreed that this movie was terrible. Some may find it funny, but there is way too much humor geared towards adults in this supposed children's movie. I would not recommend buying it, but if you r all that interested, go ahead and rent it from a movie store and save yourself some money.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I have been a fan of Smallville since episode 1. This season is particularly excellent though. Smallville has brought me so much joy over its tenure, and I will miss it, but I do think that this last season and the finale in particular really saw the show off well.     Thank you Smallville cast, crew and creators for an amazing decade of heart, hope and heroism.     z
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Amazing movie! I went to see it in theaters, and it was a amazing film! There is nothing I would complain about in this film, though young children may be scared when the girl's arm is bit off by a shark. Most people think that this movie is a effort by Christians to promote their church. Well they're wrong, the movie had a very good meaning to it, and in no way deliberately forced a religion onto them. It is a very high quality family film I would recommend for all to see.

0743219619|4.0|P.D. James (1920-) is the reigning Queen of the police procedural murder mystery genre. She is a better writer than Agatha Christie becase her characters are more well developed. James explores their psyches and past. This novel was first published in 1975.<br />  The Plot: Detective Inspector Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard is on an extended leave of absence recovering from a serious illness. Adam contemplates leaving police work for the joys of writing poetry and enjoying Vivaldi on the stereo! He is contacted by Father Michael Francis Badderly an elderly Church of England chaplain. Dalgliesh's father was himself a vicar.<br />Dalgliesh grew to like the old cleric as he grew up and wants to visit the sickly chaplain.<br />When the detective arrives in Cornwall at Toynton Grange he discovers that his old friend is already dead and cremated. Was it death due to a heart condition or murder? Dalgliesh becomes acquainted with the residents of Toynton Grange a nursing home for patients who are suffering from debilitating progressive muscular disease. One of the old patients is found murdered in her bed. Dalgliesh is also threatened by the evil that lurks in the corridors of the nursing home. Spooky moments and a brooding Hardyesque landscape make this a fine novel by James. Recommended for all fans of British mystery and the telling of a good tale by a master storyteller.

B004ZGI2KK|3.0|The trailer tries really hard to make this look like Twilight meets Little Red Riding Hood. They crammed every romantic scene into the preview. It's quite misleading, and not at all what I was hoping for. I'm glad I didn't see this prior to watching, or I wouldn't have rented it. It wasn't great, but it certainly wasn't as lame as the preview.<br /><br />While beautiful to look at, the script is lackluster at best. The story attempts to squeeze in much of the original, famous, Brother's Grimm version of the tale, but it just doesn't gel with the added plot concerning romance, family secrets, witches and werewolves.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried makes the best of a dull role, but Gary Oldman's over-the-top performance ruins every scene in which he appears - which, unfortunately, takes up more than half of the film. If I weren't a sucker for dark fairy tales, I would give this film a paltry two star rating. Alas, I did find some enjoyment in the story's mysterious elements, and the cinematography was breathtaking at times.<br /><br />I think girly tweens are most likely the best audience for this film, and considering the lack of profanity, the comparatively non-gruesome violence, and no nudity make out session, this is a film adults can let the well-adjusted, modern, twelve and up set watch with nary a worry.<br /><br />The comparisons to the Twilight franchise are silly. Valerie (Little Red Riding Hood) shows common sense when it comes to boys and the dangers they may represent, and is willing to sacrifice herself in order to protect her family and friends, quite unlike Bella and her sparkly, stalker, vampire boyfriend. Red Riding Hood is hardly a feminist statement piece, but it is refreshing to watch a fantasy film, aimed at tweens, whose leading lady doesn't discard her moral compass once a cute boy shows up. Three stars.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|You either understand what this movie is about or you don't. There is no middle ground. The story is there and one gets a glimpse of what is going on. No explanations are given, nor needed.  The acting is superb, specially Clooney, delivering a performance that expresses so much by what he doesn't say but one can perceive of him and what he is looking for. I must say i was impressed by Clooney's acting. I did not expect this much acting quality of him but he has delivered. His pauses, his silences, his doubts, the few words he says here and there. All are so carefully placed and delivered.  The photography and locations are excellent and form a perfect canvas on which the story is painted. And the story is indeed a jewel, the way it is shown gives it so much power and calmness to it.  The director has crafted a great and solid story, with breathtaking scenarios and careful and near-perfect acting.  The end result is a poetic and powerful drama.  I would not expect many people to like this film. But i do. A lot.

0316098329|2.0|Curious about captivity and its many conflicting horrors? Read John Fowles' \\"The Collector.\\"  Still the best.  Steer clear of \\"Room,\\" however.  Another highly hyped, award winning disappointment.  Now think.  If a young woman was kidnapped and forced to spend 7 years in a room with her son, wouldn't she tell him something about herself? Wouldn't he know what she used to be like? What music she liked?  Old boyfriends?  Her own parents, for God's sake?  But Jack knows nothing about his mother other than her breasts and her tears.  Hence, because Jack's inauthentic voice tells the story, readers know nothing about \\"Ma.\\"  This makes her flat, dull, pitiable but not real.  And it makes the book tedious.  And five year olds don't talk like this.  Remember. \\"The Collector\\" by John Fowles.
B0041B4H1M|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />A handsome transfer onto Blu Ray - and it has to be said - you notice it straight away too. But I must emphasize that 'DBS' looked great anyway for the vast majority of the time on my trusty old DVD. It's just that on BR you do notice the clarity far more.<br /><br />And the audio...wow! It's huge. A packed 5.1 Soundtrack that is much improved over the DVD delivers a mighty surround-sound punch - especially when all hell breaks loose in the corridors of the flooding marine facility (which is often).<br /><br />But the truth is that you'll be enjoying yourself too much to be looking out for any print difference. \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is a hugely entertaining watch and a very satisfying thriller into the bargain. It mixes great set pieces with characters you route for - and even supplies its genetically modified toothsome frights with genuinely funny moments too. So when the gorgeous Saffron Burrows gets into the water at the end of the chase to lure Mister Big Nasty People-Munching Shark to her side for a chit-chat (dialogue above) - you'll be biting your nails to beat the band...and cancelling that snorkelling holiday...<br /><br />To sum up - if you're a fan of \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" - then the Blu Ray of Renny Harlin's sharks-with-brains caper is definitely worth the upgrade. And even if you're coming to it for the first time, then you're in for a bit of a treat.<br /><br />Reasonably priced and better than a slap across the kisser with a wet mackerel - treat yourself to this watery wonder film-lovers.<br />And stop feeding your goldfish spinach...ask Samuel L.

B004YEJGEO|4.0|so, I think this is one of the more clever games I&apos;ve played in recent months, but it still has a big flaw in it. when rotating a prism, you only seem to be able to rotate one if the two outputs. solving the puzzles is really hard without that extra rotation. so unless I&apos;m missing something, this game needs that fixed before its a winner.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really liked swiftkey the week I used it. It had the best accuracy when typing out the word compared to stock. The predict was great too. I personally love swype but it&apos;s too darn inaccurate writing this review I have to correct almost every third word. Swift key is faster even hitting every key. One complaint is that it occupies too much of the screen and I have an evo so clearly it&apos;s big. With the arrows on as well it&apos;s like 75% of the screen. Anyway it&apos;s the best keyboard app in my opinion even though I use swype cuz I just like &quot;swyping&quot; if I had to write a lot of emails or texts I probably would stick to swiftkey. In fact I regret swyping this review.

B004HNTER6|5.0|To quote Top Gear, which stole a march on this kid and wrote exactly what I would've penned after a screening of '[[ASIN:B004OBQQPY Senna]],' \\"The year after [the tragic death of Formula 1 superstar Ayrton Senna], Spanish actor Antonio Banderas was set to play [the Brasilian driver] in a $100m Hollywood bio-pic. Of course, it never happened, and now it never will. With the release of 'Senna,' a feature-length documentary about arguably the greatest and certainly the most charismatic racing driver of all time, the real story has been told. Definitively, thrillingly and with real emotion.<br /><br />Big movies usually follow a three-act narrative arc and Senna's life lends itself naturally to that. It opens with never-before-seen footage of him karting in Brazil, and reaches a mesmerising and moving climax with the dreadful events at Imola in May 1994. In between, Senna's racing career unfolds in a way that even the most optimistic Hollywood screenwriter would scarcely have dared imagine. It's all here: the first glimmers of genius, the ascent to greatness, the period of domination, the bitter rivalries and intense politicking, disillusion and dismay, flawed heroism, the final grim chapter.\\"<br /><br />Please don't be led astray by any 1, 2, or even 3-star reviews. 'Senna' is a spectacular film and a moving and dramatic work of art that honors Senna the man and satisfies the yearnings of his fans to reconnect with a sporting god, while still respecting his memory and treating with dignity Ayrton's family and friends, colleagues and even rivals. I'm not ashamed to admit that the funeral coverage moved me to tears...<br /><br />\\"The circumstances of Senna's demise are as chilling as ever. The feeling that he somehow knew something terrible was going to befall him is inescapable. But in the midst of the tragedy, the film strives for an elegiac note and achieves it.

0553386794|4.0|It was not until the last chapter that I realized just how brilliant this book was.  If you aren't a fantasy lover, than this is a great introductory book; you won't feel like you are reading fantasy, just a book from the middle ages, until the last chapter or so.  Like boiling frogs, you are slowing taken into this fantasy world in such a way that by the time it is over, you will love every moment of it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and cannot wait to read the next in the series!

B004FRX0MY|4.0|The concept of this cloud player has some wonderful benefits -- same library of content available to all your devices, regardless of where you are.  The fact that Amazon's library is based on the open MP3 format instead of any DRM format also makes it much more robust and useful.  This is the first serious competition to Apple's iTunes w/o most of the headaches associated with that platform.  However, there are some issues that should be addressed to make this a more robust player:    1) The ability to d/l a playlist to your device without downloading the space-consuming songs in that playlist.  2) The ability to shuffle the songs in a playlist.  Google Music can do this, and it is one of the few things it can do that Amazon Cloud Player can't.  This should be a simple s/w fix.  3) When you display the list of all songs, it would be nice to see what playlist each song belongs to, if any.  It's a chore to search your entire library to find any orphaned songs.    There are other features that I could request to make this a dream app, but these features alone would make it much closer to ideal for me.  Add these features, and I would give it a full 5 stars.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie is a positive uplifting tribute to an amazing young lady, her family and her community.  This movie shows the best of the human spirit.  If you want to be a better person or want your children to be the best they can be.  Here is the place to start.  You will see people at the best and even a few imperfections that even the best of us struggle with.    This is a movie that will inspire you!!!
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who likes to win and does not seem to care if his clients are guilty or not as long as they pay him his ridiculously high fees.  The beginning of the movie is a little confusing as he is trying to handle few cases at a time.<br /><br />In the rest of the movie he is dealing with one of his clients, accused of killing a prostitude.  His client claims to be innocent.  I am not a lawyer and so I would not know if the movie was filled with holes as far as the technicalities of the courtroom goes, but other than that this movie is really good.  There are number of surprises with a very satisfying ending.<br /><br />Definitely a very entertaining movie.
1400052181|5.0|I am very much an avid reader. I was never really a fan of non-fiction books. To me, they never seem to hold anything eye-catching. Anything dealing with science, forget it. It couldn't hold me attention for five minutes. Science was never my strongest subject in school. I guess because, it was a little too deep for me to understand. Reading the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks made me change my thinking towards non-fiction and science. While reading the book, I learned things I never knew. I could hardly put the book down. Whenever I got a chance, I had that book in front of my face. I finished it in a week. This book made my feel excited, sadden, nervous, fearful, upset, and shocked. All those feelings multiplied, when I reminded my self over and over again that all of this was true. I have never felt that way reading any book. I have nothing but respect for Rebecca Skloot, who spent a decade of her life, preparing to tell the entire world, a story we should have know long before now. This book definitly earned its' spot in the top books to read of 2010. My heart goes out the the Lacks family, I can only hope that the release of the book has healed the wounds they have endured now that everyone knows the story of Henrietta Lacks. Many people owe their lives to Henrietta Lacks, I hope she knows that. Please, everyone readers and non-readers, take some time and read this book, everyone needs to know Henrietta Lacks. Who knows, she maybe the reason you're alive today.

0061726826|4.0|As an aspiring author I've read and heard a thousand and one times that the first sentence should be perfection. \\"Sure, okay.\\" I've said more than once. Reading is the number one advice given to hone and improve your skills, so I read a lot. Still, the first sentence advice hasn't really had much impact on me.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Delirium you ask? Thanks to this book I finally understand how much impact the first sentence can have.<br /><br />What's so special about the first sentence? Let me share it with you...<br />\\"It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.\\"<br /><br />The concept of love as a disease- now that's something I wanna read about. Everyone's suffered heartache. It's really not that much of a stretch to see it as a disease. At least I didn't (don't) think it is. So I was hooked.<br /><br />Lena's mom suffered from amor deliria nervosa, as well as her sister. She watched them suffer, and wants to avoid that risk altogether. So she has no intentions of fighting the system and undergoing the surgery for the cure. Even if her best friend thinks maybe there's more to love than just what they've been told growing up. The Book of Shhh outlines the symptoms, risks of the disease, and benefits of the procedure. Why would anyone not want to be rid of it?<br /><br />Then she meets Alex and begins questioning everything she's been taught growing up. Her questions don't just center on Alex though. She questions what happened to her mother, the laws that have been formed, and who really lives in the Wild. One thing I loved about this book was that even though the doubts formed, it took a while for Lena to truly accept that there may be another way to look at things. It takes a pretty significant even to finally get her to see another side, but it happens. Similar to what I said in my review of Wings by Aprilynn Pike, Lauren doesn't make everything happy and perfect from the start. Lena learns and grows throughout the book, and reading that kept me turning the page.<br /><br />I can't say the book was perfect. There were some areas where I felt it slowed down a little too much for me, but there was always enough to keep me going. Admittedly, I didn't know this was a trilogy and was originally disappointed with the ending. After some research (thank you Goodreads) I learned there are two more books, and that made me very happy! I'm looking forward to the next book  in this series (Pandemonium) and I intend to read Before I Fall.rom the start.

0756404738|4.0|Blame me for expecting more epic-ness. But isn't that the theme of these books? The truth behind the myths? In that respect, the book is great. Rothfuss is such a great writer, his prose and characterization is so good that I'd read a 1000 page book by Rothfuss about epic beard maintenance. Still, I'd be lying if I weren't a little disappointed with the pacing. What's a Chandrian? Do you know? Because we still really don't, but we sure do know a lot about Kvothe busting a nut. The magic, science, physics, politics and economy of the world Rothfuss have built are still vivid and arguably the best aspect of the books. The only thing that ALMOST made me put the book down was this - I HATE DENNA. If we are supposed to believe that Kvothe loves this girl, then perhaps she should be written as somewhat likable. Oh wait, here's another Denna scene. And then we wait for her to get pissed and storm off. If I had to walk on eggshells like that for some woman I'm not even dating, I'd lose her number as quickly as possible. I know she's a talented musician, hooks up with scumbags for money (which DOESN'T make her a prostitute?) and breaks down at even the slightest personal question. Auri is a character ten times more interesting than Denna. Other than that, I love these books. I just hope book three picks up the pace a little.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.
0670022411|5.0|Great read.  It's also a quick read and the story is fun.  I've read all of Anne Rice's earlier works, before the religious transformation, at least twice and I found Deborah's writing style so much easier to read.  Don't get me wrong, I still think Anne Rice's earlier works are brilliant.  This book is an easy read and never has a dull moment.  During these times of a lot of stress and worry it takes you out of reality for awhile and into a world where troubles seem very distant.  It's exciting and not predictable.  I can't wait for the next installment.

B0010HA68I|5.0|I hike a lot with my camera - having the pack and a camera strap, plus frequently a towel, there's just too much stuff around my neck. These solved the problem. My pack has loops on the front of either shoulder - I attached these straps there. Now the camera weight is transferred to the pack, Perfect length, perfect fit.  If I want to take off the pack, I'll detach the camera then use the snap connectors to attach the camera to my neck strap - nice! I picked up a couple of these plus some loop connectors. Now I have them on both my cameras and two packs.  I can also use them to attach smaller cameras, a GPS, etc. - one to each strap.<br /><br />Back to the camera - I use a Canon 7D - the length of the straps is perfect for my back packs. These sure beat the jury-rigged straps I used to use!

0553801473|5.0|I loved A Dance with Dragons. Yes, cliffhangers are frustrating when you know you may be waiting five years to have them resolved. Yes, 15% of the book is listing what's-for-dinner. Just remember that we wouldn't be so impatient if we didn't love these books, these characters and this world. When the series is over, we'll have it. The cliffhanger criticism will be moot. I have faith that it will be great. If you can't handle being challenged then I'm sure Charlaine Harris or Stephanie Meyer will be happy to take your book-buying dollar.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|RIO is a big, bright, noisy, colorful animated film from the maker of ICE AGE.  The backdrops are sumptuously beautiful and easily the best thing about the movie.  Unfortunately, RIO doesn't do anything that we haven't seen before such as FINDING NEMO, ICE AGE, etc.  You can predict every scene, what kind of characters will appear, how the leading characters will experience life-changing transformations, etc.  The voice performances are adequate, but no real standouts.  Jesse Eisenberg's shy, nerdish Blu is typical Jesse as is Anne Hathaway's coquettish Jewel formulaic cuteness.  The music is lively but not Oscar worthy.  I enjoyed this year's more inventive and quirky RANGO much more.  RIO is a good film for families to sit down with some popcorn but I don't think it'll go down as a classic.
B000002LOE|5.0|\\"Losing My Religion\\" is impeccably haunting.  \\"Near Wild Heaven\\"'s (Brian) Wilsonian counterpoints are stunning.  \\"Radio Song\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" are a blast.  The album tracks (\\"Texarkana\\", \\"Me in Honey\\", \\"Half a World Away\\") are consistently strong.  That's 2 works of genius, 2 excellent tracks, and a strong compliment of tracks.  If that's not a 5-star record, then there is no way of determining what a 5-star rock record is.    The R.E.M. fans calling this a sell-out are just nursing their sour grapes.  This record is radically different from any contemporary rock records, and continues, 20 years later(!)  to sound as innovative as it did the day it was released.  As far as I know, the medieval-rock soundscape in this record has yet to be evoked as effectively by any other artist.  This record is the opposite of a sellout.  It's a shame that a small/vocal contingent of their original fan base presumes to \\"own\\" R.E.M. as well as the right to dictate to R.E.M. how they should sound.  I'm convinced that most critics of mid-period REM (*Green* to *Monster*) would be hailing these records as masterpieces had another band made them.  As it is, it is left to the rest of us to overwhelm this vocal minority.
B003Y5H59W|3.0|He was always Capt. America, at least in spirit. He started out as the classic 98-pound weakling, then had his body scientifically bulked up to match his spirit. It resonates with the little kid in anyone that wants to be looked up to.<br /><br />Then, it takes place during WWII, the last war that Americans generally supported. It becomes clear early on that the war isn't against Germans as Germans, but against a specific group out for world domination - something that appeals to today's more carefully targeted kind of enmity. From there, it moves forward in an utterly earnest way, as if no one had ever heard of irony. Or much in the way of humor, either - after the wise-cracking Tony Stark of [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man]], this comes across a bit bland. Tommy Lee Jones does what he can to pull this one along, but the movie's sodden weight seems too much even for him.<br /><br />On the whole, it's a more than adequate comic movie, but not one I'll be coming back to.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters
B004LWZW4W|4.0|Now this is a summer movie that has it all. A smart story, great CGI and a likeable cast. The first 90 minutes is an engaging build up with more depth that your average blockbuster, followed by plenty of chaotic action to close out the final half hour. I've seen the first two of the old Planet of the Apes films and the remake by Tim Burton. Other than the originality of the first 1968 film, this prequel, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is my favorite.<br /><br />James Franco plays a scientist who stumbles upon a cure for Alzheimer's by increasing brain function. He tests it out on a chimpanzee who gives birth to her genetically enhanced offspring named Caesar, thus creating the future leader of the apes. Andy Serkis, who famously played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong, shows you why he is the best in the business at bringing motion capture characters to life. All of the movements and facial expressions of Caesar are his. In fact, Serkis ends up being more of the lead actor than Franco. It was also nice to see John Lithgow on the big screen, especially after his phenomenal work on Dexter, even though his role is rather small.<br /><br />The other stars of the show are the incredible SFX by WETA. Most of the ape scenes provide the illusion that you are watching real animals rather than something made in a computer. A few parts don't quite look as convincing, but as a whole I can see this receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects.<br /><br />Other than some moments you have to suspend disbelief as far as the story is concerned, Rise of the Planet of the Apes will not insult your intelligence, or in my case lack thereof, and it provides a nice launching point for the lengthy series that has come before it.
1423101499|4.0|I recommend Riordan for one reason only, he does mention the ancient Greeks and their gods and, I hope, make his readers want to read the myths surrounding these ancient heroes and gods.  One thing necessary to any reading of these books is the knowledge that the Greek gods were primitives. the stories associated with them could only go so far as the tellers knowledge extended, anything beyond that had to be explained as magic. Present day knowledge extends well beyond that, what was magical to those ancients has, in many cases, a present day explanation grounded in science. But Riordan gives his gods their magic, such as the gods do not have DNA, so how do they have children with humans?   How do they transform, revitalize, metamorphose, and perform all their other feats? Naturally, for Riordan, it can only be by magic and he never gives a natural explanation for anything they do, that would detract from their magic and spoil his story. Furthermore, being primitives, they have animal instincts, not human. So they are beasts, truly less than human but by their magic they can do as they want. So why are the books popular?  Frankly, I don't know. I know why I enjoy them, I recognize the primitive passions they enjoy and I like to see how ancient people behaved. This I think Riordan does very well, they are all simple and have no complexity. As such I can read the books for enjoyment, forget trying to find any moral in the tales, and use it as escapist literature, a change from the present. And there is plenty of activity in any of the books. Percy and his friends are always running into battles, most not of their choosing, they are told of others, they know some are forthcoming and they try to pick their own time on some, to keep their enemies from attaining full strength. And, when all else fails, Riordan can always draw on magic, either for his own characters, when they need to win, or to even the odds, and have the Titans always have magic to use, except it can only be primitive, and physical. Psychic magic is never employed, and I miss it.   So it is with book four. Percy and his co-demigods (my word, you like it or not?) know there is a battle coming for Olympus, and the full gods are ignoring it, they have their hands full with another battle with another Titan, not Kronos, the main Titan, but an even more ancient one who is smashing the U. S. handily and moving invincibly towards New York. But Percy must defend Half-breed camp first, the demigods are necessary for the coming defense of Olympus. Daedelus. the inventor of wings for humans, is wanted to help for the final defense, and to find him Percy must explore the Minotaur's labyrinth. Oh, the minor gods that are presented, the problems they expound, but are solved. Daedelus is found, the Titan force in the labyrinth is contained, and the Labyrinth itself is closed by sacrifice, read the book and find out how. I recommend it.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Hilarious! Neil Patrick Harris is excellent. Just the right blend of ridiculous and poignant. I'm a huge Whedon fan, and always I'm eager for any little bit of his stuff (oh for a second season of Firefly!) which may affect my objectivity on this short film. But Im pretty confident that this is one of the most entertaining 45 minutes you'll enjoy for while. Watch it on the computer for that authentic video blog feel.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|It is a story about life and the way things were.  Today - as 31 US trrops are killed in Afghanistan - we gasp.  That was a light day in the Pacific.  These men served at a time when there was less technology and communication and we did not have instantaneous visual perception.  It was war - a war that our country whole-heartedly supported and against an enemy that had struck us in a cowardly act.  The attrocities and fanatacism shown by the Japanese sometimes pale in comparison to the Nazis.  Having just read \\"The Old Breed\\" by E.B. Sledge, I had a base of additional knowledge for the series.  The series was very well done and very much straight to the heart.  My 14 year-old is fascinated with the military.  I always remind him that eventhough these are movies, they are history of the sacrafices MANY men made who will never come home.  The wounds depicted were actually worse in real-life and the real heroes didn't get up after a Director yelled 'cut' - they went home in a body bag to their greiving families.  Those who survived were never the same again.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford do a lot toward making it work. Even without their star power, though, the different element come together seamlessly. There's not a lot more to say. It has that archetypal, dried up Western town with the usual cast of charactgers. It has evil aliens collecting townspeople. As usual, the aliens, despite their vast technology, have a fondness for hand to hand combat. And, as usual, the aliens' motivation for invading Earth doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. Describing the bits and pieces doesn't describe this whole, though - it really has to be seen.<br /><br />But, now that we've seen it, I'm left worrying about the inevitable imitators sure to try this recipe - with results ranging from dismal downwards. When that happens, though this will just look better in comparison. Even so, \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" stands as the best summer movie so far this season. (Except for the final Harry Potter, of course.)<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters
0316098329|5.0|This is one of those books that absolutely any writer would be proud to have written. If I'd had to describe it with just one word I'd say: Amazing! It is simply and truly an amazing novel that can make you smile and weep at the same time; that can make you think about all the blessings in your life.<br />  I'd dare say that Emma Donoghue is a master storyteller as she takes a depressing subject matter and makes out of it a story that can be read or rather felt with joy.<br />  The all-seeing all-tell narrator right here is Jack; a five year old boy that has never spent a single moment of his short life in the outside world, as he was born in captivity. His father is someone that both he and his mother refer to as old Nick. Nick abducted his mother many years before and since then she's been living in the soundproofed room. At first she was all alone and wanted to die, but then Jack came along and decided to live.<br />  Jack is raised in a completely sterile environment; he seems to live in a fairytale world. A world created by his mother in order to protect him from the idea, or the dreams, of a freedom that is not about to come. His only connection to the outside world is the television; though he believes that everything he sees there is not true, apart from Dora, his very best friend. He also truly thinks that apart from himself, Dora, his mother and old Nick that there are no other people in the world. How could he think any different from the moment that he doesn't really know that there's a whole universe out there? He looks at the clean or clouded sky from the skylight; he looks at the stars and the moon in the night; but he considers all that part of the scenery; an extension of the room.<br />  Despite all that Jack is really happy, because he has his mother, who's all the time right there beside him, someone who knows everything apart from the things she can't remember. However, she's deeply sad, and as time goes by she starts to hate herself, for keeping the truth from the boy. It is time to put things right and the only way she can do that is by finding for them a way to escape. She tried that once before, when she was all alone, and failed, but now she has no choice but to succeed or else. To do that though she needs Jack's help, so she starts talking to him about the outside world, she tells him all the things she left behind; or most of it anyway. And she's trying to prepare him as much as she possibly can for the big escape. Jack listens to her carefully as she explains how their life is going to be inside the Out and he smiles. He thinks he understands it all, since when he was a little kid he used to think like a little kid, but now he's five and knows everything.<br />  However, the more they talk about it the more confused he gets. The only world he knows is his room; he doesn't want to leave it; never mind the fact that he spends most nights sleeping in the closet. No, he wants to stay. And that makes his mother angry. For the first time ever she treats him hard. He has to do what he's told to save their selves, and that is that. Jack, scared and brave at the same time (or scave; one of his sandwich words), has no other option but to obey. And it's exactly then that their real adventure begins.<br />  This is one of those novels that grab you by the throat and never let you go from page one until the very end. It is finely crafted, with a very good story and tons of humor that manage to make light reading out of a serious issue. The author talks in an exquisite way for the big tragedies in life; about the innocence of a child's heart; for our psychological powers, which now and again fail us; about the real play, outside in the fields that can only make us stronger.<br />  Emma Donoghue, an Irish woman living in Canada, seems to follow in the footsteps of her country's great storytellers, but not only that; she also seems to be creating her own paths into a world full of beautiful, though sad at times, stories..
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Refraction is an excellent puzzle game based on the idea of reflecting, merging, and splitting beams of light to light up all of the targets with their designated colors.

B000055Y0Y|4.0|This movie is worth watching for John Malkovich's part alone.  He plays a psycho --- but one with some depth and one that has a past that some would sympathize with.  He is an ex-CIA hit man who, by his own words, was changed irrevocably by his government work.  I love this one part of the movie where he tells Eastwood's character (I'm working from memory so this might be more of a paraphrase than a quote), \\"I don't even remember who I was before they [the U.S. government] sank their claws into me.  . . . But we can't have monsters running around in the fields, can we?\\" (This last part is a response to the CIA's attempt to kill him).  In short, there is complexity to the villain that makes the movie so much more interesting.    I am a big Eastwood fan, but even so, I'm not sure this was his best part (hence the 4 stars rather than 5 of my review).  I don't think his communications with Malkovich were all they it could have been.  I compare this to the movie FALLING DOWN w/ Robert Duvall & Michael Douglas, where Duvall is the good guy and Douglas is the \\"villain.\\"  In that movie, despite the fact that Duvall is determined to get the guy, there are some parallels between him and the Douglas character that even he recognizes. In other words, the villain is portrayed in such complexity that there is some aspect of his character for Duvall to relate to.  The same should have happened in this movie, but Eastwood didn't work that angle, and it's a shame because doing so would have humanized his character even more.

B004UXUS64|4.0|This movie leaves multiple impressions - the first of which is that the actual situationthe second Earth, lacks utterly in plausibility. So do fairy tales, but I enjoy them anyway.<br /><br />Another part of the mix comes from the creepier side of stalking, driven by a muddled emotional mix driven by some need so deep within her that Rhoda has no hope of identifying it, and no real urge to. In other words, an emotional mish-mosh that pretty much anyone can recognize, if they've ever looked within themselves at any length.<br /><br />The visual layer, though, conveys a quite beauty. Rhoda herself could be very beautiful, if she weren't so desperate not to be. The other Earth has an unearthly beauty, one informed by decades of images from space. It also has a presence that keeps intruding quietly, at every turn. I've gotten a similar feeling near Seattle, where Mt. Ranier seems to loom around every corner.<br /><br />Then, the ending raises more questions than it answers. Years of personal history led up to the period of this movie, and lifetimes continue after this interlude ends - as is true in life, too. \\"Another Earth\\" defies easy description, but don't most things worth any attention?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters
B004YEJGEO|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game that seems hard at first, but when you get the hang of it, it&apos;s amazing.
B004EJUMT2|3.0|Well after listening to this album once and generally being into a more extreme or experimental sound i don't hate it but i have one question..Is it suppose to be funny?Surely these guys can't be serious can they?Some one actually refered to this as black metal(which it clearly is not)i would call it comedy metal it's like if Tenacious D were a \\"metal\\"band and didn't rock...In other words it isn't anything to write home about like most people seam to think it is instead it is only just passable for comedic purposes only...Put it on once,laugh at the rediculous lyrics and give it too your little sister....
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It just works. The package arrived earlier than its delivery schedule. When i got it, I couldn't wait to apply the thermal compound on the cpu and the video card, the temperature dropped dramatically compared to the previous status when I accidentally removed the thermal compound while i was cleaning the dust. It really quenches the heat when I play heavy duty-games and open many movies at the same time. so it's strongly recommended.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|I had this movie delivered through Netflix and wouldn't send it back until my Amazon order came in.  I ordered one for myself, one for my sister then went back and ordered for all my girlfriends that had birthdays coming up!!  The movie also got passed around my work place and I made every female the CD that you'll see in the movie (playlist on the movie web site).  There is no way to measure the laughter this movie brought myself and my friends!      Of course parts of the movie are simply goofy but the majority of it reflects the real lives of the young, single scene.  It is more than worth what Amazon is charging and the time to watch it.  I haven't been this over the moon for a romantic comedy since Love Actually!!!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I love this story about a pig who thinks he is a sheep.  I love talking animals.  But then I grew up on a farm. We enjoyed it even though we really bought it to have for our grandchildren to watch.  My four-year-old grandson thought it was scary at first, so I'd recommend it for ages 5 and above.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I got this as a FAotD and have made it roughly through the first &apos;sector&apos;.\nIts very configurable.  So far, puzzles have been interesting, without being too complex.  Your solutions seem to be stored so you can try to improve the economy of the solution.\nLooking forward to later puzzles.  Thanks!
B004UID2LC|4.0|Awesome but kinda confusing becsuse it wont load or do anything  for me now... Worked just fine until I got a new SD card... Still pretty cool though...
B001GWK2MC|3.0|my kid can only crawl on it, she doesnt seem so be facinated by it, altough i have no choice now. Its already full of air and makes no sense to ship it back. its an ok product... maybe shell have fun with it when shes a little older ;/
B001F0TM5I|2.0|I had already seen this movie, I just wanted my own copy.  But it arrived with a blank generic Memorex DVD-R inside.  I'll be lodging my complaint.
0060594896|5.0|I have read a LOT of self help books.  THIS book pulls the best of all that I have read previously and even goes beyond!  This is like a miracle in a box!!!  LOVED it!  Bought other copies to give to family and friends!!!
B004YEJGEO|2.0|would love to get my grubby lil paws all over this app.  However, doesn&apos;t charging $.99 for the app defeat the purpose of the FAotD? perhaps an over sight but once ther correction is made ill be all over this one.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I like this apt so far. reminds me of an oldschool ff. the only problem is that the battle screen is covered by the character status window making it hard to select enemies and making my characters not visible. If this is fixed ill give it a 5. Htc aria.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I bought this from the standard android marketplace less than a month ago, and have finished all but the last two sectors worth of puzzles. The game is straight forward, and doesn&apos;t get too challenging until about the fourth set of levels. The optical components are intuitive (prism which can split and join beams, and mirrors to reflect), and you can even change the coloring scheme from pigment (RYB) to light (RGB), which was a nice touch to see for a physics major like me. I don&apos;t see it being very re-playable with the included levels, despite the feature to record multiple solutions per level. \n\nAll in all, a great time killer for the price I paid, and something definitely worth checking our if you enjoy puzzle games since it is free today.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|I first heard Midlake when \\"Trials of Van Occupanther' came out.  They reminded me of some of the Progressive Rock bands I listened to in the mid 70s.  Tim Smith's vocals have that 60s and 70s folk rock sound to it.  This is a real nice CD.  They have often been compared to old Fleetwod Mac, I would say from the \\"Bare Trees\\" era.  This is one of those bands who will never appeal to a huge mass audience, but I love their ambitious approach that they take with their music.  Nice melodies and thoughtful interesting lyrics.

0439023521|5.0|This review was written by my 12 year old daughter.<br /><br />The reality of The Hunger Games<br /><br />  I am a diligent reader for my age, and I have repeatedly proclaimed The Hunger Games as my favorite book. Not only because it is well written but the plot makes you think. From the moment I began to read it I was totally engrossed in this novel.<br /><br />I found the characters exciting and deep. Particularly the protagonist Katniss Everdeen with her undying need to survive and protect those that are weaker than she. I enjoy that Katniss is a girl that stands on her own, and she does not simply take what she is given. There is a romance which some people claim is not real and its not it is only an act put on to appease the Capitol people.<br /><br />  Even though there is a fair bit of violence in this novel (Isn't there a lot of violence in this world) there must be some cruelty to make a plot line and to make you think. There must be hundreds of people dying from violence now in this world we live in,  many are children.<br /><br />  There is also a certain reality behind it. I think of the Capitol as America, and the other first world countries, and the districts as the rest of the world. Although we don't have children carted in to our city so we can watch them die as entertainment. There are many children across the world dying from starvation dying from Hunger, as we throw away excessive amounts of food. I enjoyed this book because it made me realize this even if there is not much we can do about it. We, if you think about it, in our own real world play our own Hunger Games.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|good game to hard to control on EVO , good idea and would be a lot of fun if there were a better way to control both light outputs.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|My grandson who lives with his parents -loves all kinds of space type movies. I was fortunate to get this old movie for his birthday. Thanks you for all you do for your customers. I will order items in the future for my family. Thanks you, Ms. Stephens
B003VANOFY|2.0|I have been gaming for years, so I was really excited when my Logitec wireless gaming headset G930 arrived.  I downloaded the software. No console came up. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing. I went to Logitecs website and downloaded the lastest software. When I click on Configure 930G, nothing happens. My screen flashes for a second but nothing happens. I even tried it with Run as Administrator. I'm on Windows 7    Nothing.      Sure I can use it as a regular headset but who wants to pay $199 for that?    I have contacted the seller to see if he will issue a refund if I return the item.    I'm extremely disapointed. I know how to install software, read directions and follow them.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Never been a fan of Matthew Mc., but this was a very good movie, and he was great in it. He needs to ditch the stupid rom-coms and focus more on films like this. An A-list, stellar supporting cast bolsters and raises this standard potboiler to a tense, exciting legal drama. Not quite as good as \\"Michael Clayton\\", but similar in tone and style.
B004Z7AI4W|4.0|ordered this for my daughter's 11th birthday.  she loves it.  we all thought it was better than the first movie.  must have for all Wimpy Kid fans.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 official<br />Viewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6<br /><br />Bending light to your will is what this game is all about. Using mirrors and prisms, you're challenged (well challenged as you go along) to get the colors of light from its source to it's destination. This often includes blending the primary colors, splitting them, and moving through wormholes. Since there is more than one solution to any given level it might sound easy, but the game balances put by instituting limitations on the number of mirrors and prisms you can use in each level. Obstacles are also placed in your way, making you think on how best to move the light from place to place. The look and feel of the game are very nice, with a dim background that makes the vivid colors of light really stand out. Sound is a little disappointing, but only because there isn't an audio cue to several game events, such as connecting the right color of light to its destination. Controls are responsive and easy to use. Game performance was perfect, without a slowdown, hang, or crash. I did note a bug or two in the game, but nothing that made the game lss enjoyable or playable. There is no scoring system, so no leaderboards or the like for comparing your solutions.<br /><br />Loved the lite version, and was glad I bought the full.
1936719010|2.0|I was wrong about this book. Unmoving and hopeless.     At first, I give it go without judgment, even though I didn't like fact that part the book's written in the big font. So called highligts.   That meant to me that the author is trying to strech things bit further...    It appears he didn't have much to say. This is very short book and no juicy moments for myself. The story about resistance without rewards or motivation ? Does the author really know the subject ? Not sure, the will's there, but not sure about talent.    Speaking of my feelings and not logic, I felt betrayed.    I've heard all this before. Sad.     The only thing came to my mind; if I was 14 years old, I might enjoy this book. It's knights against dragons. Hell, yes.  Would be good introduction to attitude of how to ...how to, I don't know really what. Make a homework ?    2/10
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I liked Back to Black a lot, but Frank is worlds better in my opinion. Amy was at the top of her game with this album, with astonishing range, pitch, and timing. It's hard to imagine any 19 year old could sing like this. Amy is truly gone too soon. I'm thankful she left this gem for us to enjoy.
030726999X|5.0|Watching The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sparked my interest in the Millennium Trilogy Series. I immediately purchased the three books before the last two movies were released. I couldn't put them down. I have to say that Hornet's is simply fantastic as the concluding book of the series. Stieg Larsson captures Stockholm beautifully and our heroine, my favorite since Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, is able to finish up her story.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|You've seen this movie before.  It looks pretty but the story is kind of dumb unless you're into religious idolatry and talking wolves.  If you like this twilight teenage stuff you'll probably like this movie, if you have at least moderate movie taste probably not.  It's not like hollywood will actually dig up a new story to slap on the screen so it has to be based on something like a fairy tale, old movie, history, etc, because people don't want to watch something new and fresh unless it involves creepy looking garbage eating aliens.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I picked up the free version of this app then the paid version popped up on the free app of the day so I downloaded it. the free version is quite full and useful and doesn&apos;t feel like things are missing from it so I probably wouldn&apos;t pay for this one but it is a very useful app. I like the function of having to set requirements to snooze, cutting time off each consecutive snooze, and limiting the number of snoozes. I also like the ability to use a random song as an alarm sound. I have to change my alarm sound frequently or it stops waking me up so a random song option is very useful for me.
B00009R6BF|5.0|Fantastic product. I purchased an adapter and am using it with my tripod and camera to reach spots impossible with just the tripod, Totally please and would recommend it to everyone.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Alarm Clock Plus.  Why?  Because ACP has a GREAT nap feature that allows you to instantly set yourself an alarm wo having to laboriously go through the motions.<br /><br />ACE functions well, does what it's supposed to, and overall is a decent lil app. It received 4 stars from me simply because I happen to like ACP better.

0307454541|4.0|Spurred by the film, I decided to give the very popular book a try. At first I was disappointed. The book starts out slow, I have to admit. I usually give up after the first 100 pages if the book does not pick, but after watching the film I thought this would get better...and it did. You have to to stick with it.<br /><br />The story follows the mysterious disappearance of a member of one of Sweden's most prominent families. After many decades of being missing the patriarch of the family decides to look into the mystery one last time. He hires a writer/publisher of a highly controversial magazine to look into the disappearance. This writer, Mikael Blomkvist in turn hires his own assistant, the GRANDIOSE Lisbeth Salander (my personal favorite heroine since Elizabeth Bennett). Salander is a hacker who has a terrible background.<br /><br />Together these two eventually unveil the mystery and the reader is along for the wonderful ride.
B00006879E|5.0|Every one of these tracks are really good.  This is a classic Maroon Five cd with such outstanding songs.  One of my favorite's is Secret and when I listen to the music I just get lost in it. Love it!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I am completely hooked on this game. I downloaded it and went to go eat breakfast,  half an hour later I was still playing this game and hadn&apos;t eaten. The only thing that bothers me though is I don&apos;t think there should be an option to use pigment primary colors. It&apos;s a game about light, use the primary colors of light! I know you can switch it to be that way but it should just be that way... Using the primary colors of pigment doesn&apos;t make sense. Other than that though, it&apos;s completely great!
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is a great DVD to show off your LED flat screen!! Terrific photography and amazing shots of India. 4 star movie and 5 stars for artistic vision.
030745455X|5.0|I love the Millennium Trilogy. However, Fire is my personal favorite. The reason this is my favorite is because it tells us much more about Lisbeth, the heroine of the series. We are formally introduced to her and realize why she's done some of the things she's well, done.<br /><br />You should definitely read Dragon first as this story continues on from the first.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|_Generation Kill_ is a war story, of course. But it's also a story about who we are. I suppose all good war stories should be. But this one is a rare look at the complex identity of a group of elite men who are, in turns, the products of Marine Corps discipline and MTV self-absorption. Where they might fail to study the philosophical implication of their situations, but there are moments when the characters seem to glow with a zen-style understanding. This is a loving take on the men who fight for us and the tangle of beauty and horror and humor and  absurdity that outlines their experiences doing so.
B004YEJGEO|2.0|First 2 levels were easy, but then the 3rd was so difficult that I didn't even care enough to figure it out.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Great timer waster, keeps you engaged, and difficulty steadily increases as you go. Some of the puzzles feel like a true accomplishment when you solve them!
0553801473|2.0|If you loved books 1-4, stop there and make up your own ending, it will be much more satisfying than what is delivered by the author.  I have never looked so forward to a book and been so disappointed with the results.  Martin lets us become intrigued with a story line and characters that are so compelling we can't wait to see what they'll do next and how their role plays out in the bigger story.  What he ultimately gives us is an incredibly insensitive lack of continuity of characters.  The ones we care about the most are senselessly killed off while he keeps introducing more characters and story lines that make little sense and add nothing to advance what seemed to be the original intent of the story.  In almost 1,000 pages filled mostly with fluff, there is no incentive to make me even think about buying #6 no matter how much hype it gets.  This book is only a \\"must read\\" if you relish being disappointed.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|First I should start off saying, I read this book in a day and half.  I couldn't put it down.  But only because I wanted to see how things panned out.  I'm surprised this book got so many great reviews.  The first reviewer was right about how dysfunctional the couple are and how weirdly violent and insane Travis is.  He punches people until they bleed in the middle of the cafeteria.  Abby has so much pride and pretty much causes all this drama.  I am just really disturbed by how many people liked this book!
075640407X|5.0|This is THE BEST BOOK that I have bought so far in my lifetime. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys the Adventure Fantasy type. I love it, I have gotten this book for friends and family that I know enjoy reading, and they LOVED IT also. This book will keep you turning the pages! I never wanted to put it down.
0345522478|5.0|This book is first rate! Hounded took me by surprise with the cool supernatural plot twists, lovable heroes and a extremely cool story.The action is engrossing the humor is really funny and the pacing and timing are superb. There is no lack of imagination but rather a wealth of great material. Hearne has a way with words that is simply delicious. Very few authors can spin a phrase or a line or a scene that i will reread immediately several times just for the savor of it. I can't say enough about Hearnes writing. He is brilliant and I can't wait to read his other books.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|I liked this CD on the first playing. It is what John Hiatt does better than most - excellent song writing and playing. There are some real gems here, \\"Damn this Town\\", \\"Down Around My Place\\" and \\"Adios to California\\" really stood out on the first spin. Simply put, if you like John Hiatt's style he is in great form on this disc.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Builds good problem solving skills. My 8 year old likes it as much as I do. Works great on Droid 2.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|This set has really good quality both audio and video.   The extra features are entertaining and informative.  The show is first rate and it really hits the ground running. It doesn't take long to develop and the characters are interesting and well defined. If you haven't seen the show you'll love it by the third episode and if you have seen it you'll definitely want to add this set to you DVD library.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Bought this app before it was free.  I use it every day.  The ability to use your own music is nice as are most of the other customizations.
0553801473|2.0|If I wasn't already bought into the series with books 1-4 (and if I hadn't waited 6 years for it) I would not have finished this book. This book is a perfect example of what happens when you don't plan out exactly what you're doing. I think GRRM really screwed up big time with AFFC and now this. He introduced too many PoVs and the book starts to feel really disjointed about halfway through when it seems like nothing happens with many of the main characters just so we can get more of the PoVs in. Characters like Victarion and Asha are super interesting and all, but they just don't advance the overall story.<br /><br />The mark of a series going sour in books and in TV is usually when you watch/read a bunch of stuff without anything really happening. There is really no other way to describe this book. Let's look at some examples (minor spoilers):<br /><br />Tyrion - A favorite character to many; last we heard from him he was being squirreled off by Varys. In this book, he goes across the narrow sea and then does.... essentially nothing. If you read the preview chapter for Tyrion on GRRM's site, then you're pretty much where I am after reading the book.<br /><br />Danaerys - This was the biggest travesty of them all. Literally zero movement here.<br /><br />Jon - This character had some movement, though if you've read the preview chapter (posted on GRRM's site in 2008) there is really nothing of interest here until the last Jon Snow chapter in the book.<br /><br />Theon - This character was pointless and drawn out.<br /><br />Overall, as well, there is VERY little different in this book.<br /><br />The whole idea of this book is to try and take as long as possible to build stuff up as to make even the smallest changes seem epic. Things like Theon's escape attempt takes many, many needless chapters of labored anguish. Why?!<br /><br />The whole book is structured foolishly as well: the first half is split about evenly between Tyrion, Jon, and Danaerys with some Theon sprinkled in. The characters move slowly, but it's acceptable. After the first half, the book turns into PoV after random PoV. Asha, Victarion, Melisandre, Barristan, it's just random person after random person and then it brings people back from AFFC. Of course, nothing is going to get tied up! The story basically stops halfway through the book!<br /><br />This is the problem with this whole 'time split' thing. He needed more PoVs for AFFC and so now he needs to wrap those PoVs up, even though the story doesn't need them to continue. Textbook case of good intentions gone wrong. Bit sad to see this happen to a great series.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for her birthday...easy to find, easy to purchase, good price, on-time delivery, AND one happy girl!  Can't ask for much more....thanks!
1595141715|5.0|AMAZING book everyone should read this book. Definitely one of thee BEST books I have ever read. At first you would think it's just a sad story about a girl who dies and wants us all to pity her. But you're wrong it's a great book that helps everyone understand the truth about teen suicide. It also creates some really great suprises that you will never see coming. I could not put this book down to save my life. READ IT you won't regret it.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Downloaded as a free app. Definately worth the dollar. Challenging but will not make you rip your hair out. Will likely make you feel more like a genius than you actually are...
B000002L5I|4.0|I bought this when it was first released, It's still kept in my rotation. No, it ain't his best album, but it has its moments. If you're a fan, you'll like it. He was still very young when this was recorded, but talent is ageless. It's a solid performance that's sure to please.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I am a customers of Amazon since 2007.    I am 100% satisfied the brand new condition as stated by Amazon.
B0031RS894|2.0|Knowing this was Quick Read when I purchased it, I didn't set my standards too high on quality. But, in all honesty, this was a terrible read. Compared to other works by Raynor this one seriously lacked in many areas with the main one being the Doctor's personality. I mean honestly, where was it? I didn't get the feeling that Raynor was writing about Ten at all; in fact I couldn't place any of the Doctors into this particular story. I've read much better fanfiction than this piece of drivel.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This story is one we've all heard before.  Ordinary boy turns out to be extraordinary in some ways and becomes an improbable hero.  Now add in the supernatural and you have ... Harry Potter?  Percey Jackson? Eragon?  All of these are better written characters.  The book just isn't that interesting.  I really wanted to love this book but it just didn't do much for me.  The story is pretty bare bones with big loopy logical leaps in it.  Although there is plenty of exposition (aside from the death of the main character's grandfather, not much happens in the first half of the book), very little of it explains subsequent decisions and events.      I've read reviews stating that the \\"creepy\\" pictures really made a difference in this book.  That may be so - but if you are viewing it on the Kindle, it's difficult to really see the photographs.  It was especially difficult to read captions and a picture of a hand written letter on the Kindle.  If you really want to read this, get the physical book.  I don't think this would have made a difference in how I felt about the book but for some people it might.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I was skeptical about this app because, well, my phone came with an alarm app and how much can you really improve on that? turns out you can improve a LOT! The level of customization in this app is amazing, and you can easily come up with settings that are tailored to the way that will wake you up best.\n\nI use this every day and have not slept through my alarm for months, not even once since I started using it. (That used to happen to me a lot.) If you use your cell phone as an alarm clock there is no reason not to use this app, especially since it is free today.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This is one of my favorite films! So detailed, smart, and funny. If you enjoy the quirky, strange characteristics we all possess, you will also enjoy this film.

B0058P7KUA|5.0|This has got to be one of the best games available for Android. The game is neither hard-core, nor is it casual. It's just right! The main character, Barry Steakfries, is pretty clever in his one liners! I absolutely love the controls. (The left joystick controls the character and the joystick on the right aims and fires your primary weapon). I like the variety in weapon choices and the fact that one can also hold a secondary weapon, like grenades. (Grenades+Zombies=A BLAST!)    I do feel the game is a bit short and I wish the difficulty can be raised a bit higher. Other than that, I see no reason as to why this game should not be left untouched.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a great alarm clock. I&apos;ve been using the free one for the past year. It&apos;s a quick, easy to use, customizable clock.\n\nI REALLY wish that android does that sleep monitoring app that Apple has. I would pay for a good one.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Great job developers.   I&apos;m a big fan of puzzle games and this one is a lot of fun.   I don&apos;t know what the one reviewer considers &quot;a high end phone&quot; but this thing runs without a hiccup on my rooted droidx and galaxy tab.    Thanks again!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|My daughter has been anxious to stream video from her new MacBook Pro to our flat screen TV. Unfortunately, none of the standard connections would work directly. I did a little research and discovered this excellent little device that converts from the Mac's mini display port to HDMI. I was a little leary at first because the new MacBooks have discontinued the mini display port and replaced it with the Thunderbolt port. Thanks to Google, I discovered the new Thunderbolt port was backwards compatible with the mini display port and this device was supposed to work in both. The only warning I saw was to make sure to use a newer HDMI cable to ensure audio worked. I added one of the Amazon basics HDMI cables [[ASIN:B003L1ZYYW AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard]]] to the order and I'm pleased to say the setup works like a charm.

0439023521|5.0|This is the best book I have read since Twilight that I wasn't able to put down. I enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait for the movie.  It reminds me of what N. Korea is like except its based out of The Apalachian Mountains.  Every character is twisted in their own way but not in ways you would predict.  I have read the whole series and look forward to starting them over, they got me through a very tough winter.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|It's stunning how this movie reflects today's age of unbelief.  The premise is that God does not exist and that an afterlife is out of the question.  This philosophical view is the thread that ties this movie together, a movie that attempts to move beyond it but leaves one, if one is an unbeliever, unconvinced.  Matt Damon plays a psychic reader with a specialization in contacting the dead.  He no longer practices because he sees it as a curse rather than a blessing.  The movie's plot moves lethargically towards its conclusion, where eventually Damon and the other two main protagonists life's intersect.  The viewer is left wondering, at first, how this will ever happen, and one feels as if one is watching three different movies with only the weakest link between them.  There were some problems with the script: a potential paramour of Damon's is overplayed by the actress; there is a scene where, for someone who is insistent on not discussing his life as a psychic, Damon goes into an excessive soliloquy about the very same subject.  This and the general loose connections among the characters left me very unsatisfied.
0446402397|1.0|Here's the second sentence of this multi-award-winning NY Times bestseller (I've included the first for context):    \\"The snowball thumped into the back of Jora's head. Caught by surprise, the snow exploded around his ears.\\"    Obviously, the writer means to say that Jora was caught by surprise. Grammatically, though, it's the snow that's surprised. That's sloppy at best and, at worst, incompetent. Even if this (first-time) novelist can be forgiven the lack of basic skill necessary to communicate effectively in writing, his editors cannot. (Again, that's just the second sentence -- you can only imagine how much worse it gets from there.) I'm returning this syntactically dyslexic mess for a full refund.

0061452068|5.0|Regardless of what naysayers claim, the lot of humanity has improved steadily over the ages.  Longevity, poverty, education, illness - these and other indicators can be counted as improved.  Why?  According to Ridley, the most important factors are specialization and exchange, or basically the underpinnings of a capitalist economy.  Ridley shows how these two factors allowed man to increase his standard of living - the farmer could trade with the fisherman, who could trade with the weaver, and so on, allowing each of them to have more products at lower prices. Ridley emphasizes that lowered costs comes not just in nominal prices but also in the amount of time one needs to work to earn enough to buy goods and services.  Today in the US, the poorest have amenities that European royalty in the 18th cebtury never had - indoor lighting, plumbing, refrigeration, etc.  We take this for granted and forget how far we have come.  Is everything perfect?  No.  But Ridley asserts that the exchange of ideas and free economies will continue to provide improvements in all areas.  Ridley tackles the difficult task of challenging global warming doomsayers - he is not a denier but he gives a balanced presentation of its history as well as the potential harm from renewable energy, something that is never mentioned.  For example, he explains how much land would need to be used by certain biofuels, reducing the amount available for nature.  I felt good just reading the opening chapter because Ridley accurately describes how good we have it today and how much better it can continue to get, for all, if we don't forget the true sources of our proesprity.

B004XANKVO|3.0|Ok the price is high. Many reviewers, as well I, have gotten this out of the way. So let's move on, because what you want to know is if the price is worth it.<br /><br />Is it? No.<br /><br />When first looking at the bag on the outside (and in, albeit briefly)this bag is attractive with a black body contrasted with white speckles while the inside is a mix between gray and baby blue diagonal patterns. It looks like an atypical laptop backpack and looks more like hiking gear. + 1 for that at least. Also this bag is made in Sweden, and it looks foreign (hard to explain, but that's not a bad thing).<br /><br />Examining further you will notice lots of space. There are many pockets, and in some places you would not expect. There are 2 full size compartments in the back followed by many little ones in the front. There is also a hardshell case where you can put things that you do not want crushed (says uncrushable compartment, but you could probably come up with many ways that items in that pocket could be smashed--like say, a car backing over it?). My 15\\" PC laptop fits very nicely in its pouch and; the cushioning is pretty thick on the back where it sits.<br /><br />The last positive thing I will say about the Thule is that the zippers and outside material are well made. As you can see in one of the videos this backpack is equipped with those very big zippers you would find in, for instance, a very well made snow jacket. The zipper track is also thick and wide. The outside covering of the backpack is sturdy, and threaded nicely, but would be prone to snags.<br /><br />How could I not recommend this when it is attractive, has lots of storage, and has, up till this point, been described as being well made? Read on.<br /><br />I did say some of the Thule was constructed very well, but that is where it ends. The material inside the compartments is a really thin nylon material that would be very prone to punctures or snags if you had anything pointy or rough. With frequent use (I have owned backpacks with this material) it degrades quickly.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are very stiff and uncomfortable. It is like slinging a block of wood around your shoulders. When you add your laptop and other things to carry, that strap digs and digs until it starts to hurt after a short while. Honestly, the most important thing about a laptop backpack is number 1: How is the comfort? If we did not want it on our backs we would have bought a carrying case.<br /><br />When examining this as a potential purchase do not let the price distract you such that you think you are getting more than a comparable item half the price of the Thule. As you can see, even a hundred dollar backpack brings with it its share of faults, and in this case; the major fault impedes its ability to function on even a basic level--a comfortable way to transport your laptop.al) it degrades quickly.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|At last!  High def Spielberg dinosaurs!<br /><br />Grated, writing this 10 weeks prior to release I have not actually seen the discs.  However, one of the reasons for the delays in releasing Spielberg films has been his insistence on quality transfers.<br /><br />What has me most excited is that this set does indeed include DTS surrounds.  Jurassic Park was the first commercial release to utilize Universal's proprietary digital surround sound system.  For the initial DVD releases of the first two films, if you wanted DTS you had to buy the edition that specifically had DTS instead of Dolby Digital surrounds (which I did).  I remember running the staff previews for this film during dry runs for all four prints my theatre had in 1993, and the effect was truly amazing; it was a dramatically startling change from analog stereo, as incredible as the CGI/puppet dinosaurs themselves.
B000009HF2|5.0|Around midnight, I was driving along a straight 2-lane road with no traffic or stop signs for at least an hour.  Everyone else in the car was asleep so the radio was my company.  On came the song \\"Do you feel like I do\\" by Peter Frampton.  What an enjoyable listening experience!  On this piece, Peter makes the guitar \\"talk\\", sort of.  If you have 14 minutes and 18 seconds of quiet time, buy this CD and listen to it.  The rest of the CD is not bad either.
B00479SVBU|2.0|Before I buy a product I always like to read user reviews on Amazon, and based on the high marks I thought this was going to be a winner, but overall I was disappointed with this unit.    Pros:  - Can save up to four FM frequencies.  - Display is fairly easy to read, even in bright light.  - Can handle up to 32GB SDHC cards.  - USB port and 3.5mm audio in and audio out jacks.  - Display can tilt.  - Ability to adjust bass, treble, contrast, and volume.   - The remote control provides the ability to fast forward or rewind in several increments (much like a DVD) like 2x, 4x... all the way up to 60x (which is good for navigating through long audio book tracks).     Cons:  - The unit does not automatically save the track time position of the track being played when the unit is turned off. In order to remember the track position you must make a bookmark location by holding down the Play/Pause key for 2 seconds or pressing the bookmark button on the remote control. Only one bookmark can be saved at a time, so attempting to make another bookmark by pressing the Play/Pause key for 2 seconds merely erases the previously saved bookmark. The Play/Pause key must be pressed a second time for 2 seconds to make a new bookmark.   - The unit does not have a good way of navigating items in subfolders. Subfolders are displayed on the same \\"level\\" as their parent folders. For example, if you have a parent folder \\"Audiobooks\\" containing 25 subfolders, a parent folder \\"Classical Music\\" containing 50 subfolders (one for each composer), and a parent folder \\"Kids Music\\" with 10 subfolders, all 85 folders will be displayed together on the same screen.  - Folders are not displayed alphabetically. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the way folders are listed. Some of them appear to be alphabetical (for example the folders beginning with D and E are in order and the folders beginning with Z and V are in order, but in between a bunch of folders out of order (and they are not subfolders which might otherwise explain it). Thankfully, the individual audio files within the folders seem to be sorted properly.   - The unit seems to be made of a cheap grade of plastic and it feels like a tremendous amount of stress on the plastic when inserting and taking the unit out of the vehicle's accessory port. It's the type of unit I can picture breaking into several pieces if dropped onto a hard surface. At least one other reviewer on here said his unit's case did break rather easily.   - No way to fast forward or rewind from the unit itself--it can only be done via the remote control.   - When scrolling through the list of files or folders it does not cycle back to the beginning when you reach the end or back to the end when you reach the beginning. This is cumbersome when you have many folders to navigate through.   - Navigating different functions of the unit, you are given about 2 seconds or less before the unit automatically returns to the main \\"home screen\\". Including a \\"Home\\" button would have been a welcome feature.   - The navigation on the unit itself is not intuitive, however the remote control provides for better navigation.   - Sometimes the unit produces a deep hum in the background of the audio being played. Turning the unit off and back on again eliminates the hum.   - Only supports MP3 and WMA formats (which is unable to play audio books from Audible.com).  - Not a high quality LCD display. In certain display modes (such as the list of folders and files) a black line is visible on the display. The unit seems to use some sort of old display technology, perhaps the type that was one time common on some types of wrist watches.
0439023513|1.0|Before I get into my review, let me start out by saying that the romance has always been my favorite part of this series.  Yes, I realize that the books aren't really about that, but that's what I loved and like it or not, it has been a big part of the series. So most of my review will be about that.      SPOILERS AHEAD        Peeta and Katniss' relationship was my favorite parts of the first two books.  Their scenes together captured my imagination.  Even though Katniss was pretending in HG, there was a chemistry between them that I loved immediately. The ending to that book broke my heart, but then CF gave me renewed hope.  It was great seeing them bond together, and how miserable Katniss was when he was captured. Then this book happened.  At first, things were going well. I was excited, even if Katniss' seemed a little flat in this book.  I knew this was going to be the book that she finally told Peeta that she loved him - Gale had already got chosen in CF, while Peeta didn't have anything to show for his efforts yet, so I had a good feeling that this book was finally going to be the payoff to all that buildup.  My prediction was going well at first, it seemed the evidence was mounting that Katniss loved Peeta and that she was going to choose him (she was mourning the loss of a feeling she couldn't put a name to, kissing the pearl, when he was first rescued she wanted to be the first face he saw, and to kiss him again.) So I kept reading, eager for the inevitable \\"I love you\\" that I felt he had earned many times over and dreading that he would die immediately afterwards or reject it thanks to his hijacking... but that just added to the suspense. The stories were building to that, right? I was looking forward to that moment, so I kept reading through a book that I wasn't really otherwise enjoying (definitely not like the first two.)     And as I read, I started to get worried - Katniss had all but tossed up her hands and given up on him. What was going on? The moment of confession still hadn't come towards the end, and it was beginning to feel like it would never happen. I had been hoping it would come at some crucial point in the war, when Katniss would somehow see her love for Peeta and wouldn't be able to withhold it anymore, but no.  Maybe I was wrong?  But I was sure that I wasn't, it seemed like poor writing to have all that buildup and hints and then go nowhere with that plot.    It came at the very end. As an afterthought. A sad concession of love from one broken person to another. I was happy, but I also felt hollow. It wasn't what I had hoped for at all. It wasn't satisfying. I guess maybe it was realistic, but I didn't really want realism, at least not when it came to their relationship.  On a positive note, I did find the \\"Real or not real?\\" \\"Real.\\" very sweet and it did bring a tear to my eye...but I wish we had gotten to see more of their \\"growing back together.\\" The ending of the story reminded me of a summary instead of an actual part of the story - but more on that in a minute.    Thinking about it more, I think the biggest problem I have is that both Peeta and Katniss could have died many times over at the end, and Peeta would have never known that Katniss loved him. That seems so cold. When they were going to separate, I really expected that to be where she would say it. It makes me sad to think that after all Peeta had gone through for her sake, he could have easily died thinking that he was unloved, or Katniss could have died and he would have lived his entire life not knowing that the person he loved most in the world loved him back. I guess Katniss had a lot on her plate at the moment, but I wish she could have for once taken time to consider him and her feelings for him.  I didn't even want a \\"fairytale ending\\" for them, I just wanted the moment to have more of an impact.    Anyway, back to the point I was making before.  Besides the romance, I feel this book highlighted a problem with all three of the books (in varying degrees). Collins has a bad habit of telling, not showing.  The problem was horribly apparent in this book. Katniss tells us about her emotions, we don't really get to see them. In the beginning of the book I got the sense that she was really broken up about Peeta. But once Peeta shows back up, I never got a real sense of her emotions ever again. In fact, Peeta showing back up and strangling Katniss is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. I was shocked and excited by the end of that chapter and I left off because I thought the next chapter would be amazing.  But...we just pick up with Katniss waking up and we're told a bit about what had happened. How much better would it have been if we were with her in that scene, feeling her horror and confusion as someone who she had missed so much was strangling her?  It would have been so much better if we could have seen everyone else around her reacted, and then how she felt when she learned that he had been hijacked, but we're just told about it after the fact.      After that, Katniss tells us she's sad, and she also tells us she's annoyed. She says she accepts that Peeta is never coming back and makes out with Gale.  Okay, but how did she come to that conclusion?   How would a real person feel if someone who they cared about deeply was brainwashed and they were partially responsible for it? How would a real person feel about accepting that the person is never going to be the same again, that they're gone mentally forever? I imagine there would be more to it than \\"Oh that's sad. I'm sad. ...Well, might as well go with my next best option to console myself.\\" I'm not even saying that it's unrealistic to seek comfort from someone else, but her thought process and emotions left much to be desired.  She tells us she wants to kill Snow, she tells us she's sad about all the deaths she's witnessed but again, it was hard for me to get a sense of her actual emotions or get behind her motivation to kill Coin. It was hard for me to even be sad about Prim's death, which should have been tragic.     Katniss didn't feel like an actual person, she felt like a character that I was being told about by someone else who had read a book and was now describing it to me. And don't even get me started about the endless exposition about the war, especially at the end of the war, where Katniss fails her mission and then hears all the details from other people. (That sounds familiar!) It felt like an info dump honestly. Not at all the kind of action I was hoping for.  Then of course, there's the ending, where we're shown absolutely nothing.  We're just given a summary about how Katniss came back to life and grew together with Peeta and tried to move on.  I could have gotten the same information on Wikipedia and saved myself a lot of time and energy.
0425241505|4.0|Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy:<br />[...]<br /><br />In DRAGON BOUND, Thea Harrison has melded the animal alter-egos of her Wyr hero and heroine with their human behaviors to create one of the most delightful paranormal romances I've read in a very long time. While Dragos Cuelebre, the one and only dragon, may be too Alpha for some, I was a big fan of this eons old creature turned \\"boyfriend\\". Add interesting mythology, snappy dialogue, and smoking chemistry, and it's no surprise that I couldn't bear put this book down.<br /><br />Harrison does a fantastic job writing Dragos, her paragraph describing his birth with the Big Bang and early memories of sailing on solar flares is one of my favorites, and really drives home how ancient and alien he is. Dragos is a wicked old dragon, and anything but politically correct. Autocratic, high-handed, and a perilously close to a sociopath, Harrison manages to write a charming and sexy love story for this man without ever deviating from his true nature. His dialog had me laughing out loud, and my copy of DRAGON BOUND has more highlighted quotes than any other book that I own. True to type, Dragos is the ultimate adapter, and I share Pia's weakness for his crafty, charming ways. I enjoyed watching the ultimate predator and the ultimate herbivore dance with each other and fall in love.<br /><br />Dragos and Pia have a very elemental relationship that ties in beautifully with their intrinsic animal natures. So much of their chemistry and interaction is tied up in Pia's secret Wyr form, I found the story more plausible and even more enjoyable the second time around. I look forward to reading STORM'S HEART, the newest of the Elder Races series which was released this week, as soon as I can find the time to pull it out of my TBR pile. And I know I'll be back to revisit DRAGON BOUND whenever I need some laughter and chemistry to brighten my day.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Several sex scenes, one scene of magical coercion.
B004TRKH9O|5.0|My impression of Zeit is that the band members of Tangerine Dream were aiming to try and out-do the dark, nightmarish psychedelic period of Pink Floyd (such as what we experienced from albums like A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle and even the studio portion of Ummagumma for that matter).  I think it actually works.  This is some EXTREMELY moving stuff.    Unlike Pink Floyd however, there's no actual songwriting to speak of.  Just waves upon waves and layers upon layers of incredibly spooky soundtrack/ambient sounds that will definitely take your mind through a variety of the creepiest settings and places in the entire universe.  Seriously, this stuff is so whacked out that your imagination won't stop at just planet Earth.  This journey takes us to Neptune and beyond!    Interesting side note- the more you hear this stuff, the more it absorbs into your mind.  The ambient sounds actually manage to come together to create lengthy masterpieces.  I can't explain HOW it works, but it does.  Give it a chance.  Definitely the kind of album you need to hear several times in order to fully and properly digest.  My favorite song by FAR is the opener titled \\"Birth of Liquid Plejades\\".  The first 7 minutes sounds like nothing but the DARKEST violin (or cello) solo in the history of mankind.  It sounds like it's just repeatedly playing one or two ominous notes over and over, totally reminiscent of the soundtrack from the relatively popular film There Will Be Blood.  After that portion of the song is over, these organs come into the picture and they're noticeably creepy as well.  The synths are remarkably melodic, if I recall.  That carries us through most of the song.  Let me describe \\"Birth of Liquid Plejades\\" even more.  The cellos actually remind me of this forest area that takes about 10 minutes to walk there from my house.  This area is right when the Amish fields stop and the woods appear.  It's pretty darn creepy, especially 20 minutes after the sun sets on a calm October night.  The woods sort of go around in a circle, and when the conditions are right I feel like I'm being haunted by something.  I've also seen some strange things back there such as weird bugs and animals I couldn't recognize coming out of the woods and looking at me.  I've also had pets buried back there.  This song makes me think about that particular area and really elevates the feeling of creepiness.  Now after those 7 minutes of cellos conclude, the song seems to take another ghostly turn- this time making me think about ghost ships that have disappeared into the fog and were never seen again.  This section of the song really captures the feeling of mystery concerning the ships and even includes these occasional ghostly hawls to really elevate the atmosphere.  These ghostly sounds always appear at JUST the right time.  I love it.  The song then finishes up with some organs to make it seem like everything we've just experienced is related to heaven in some way.  Just a wonderful song overall and one that's totally unlike anything else.    \\"Nebulous Dawn\\" is mostly made up of, again, distinctly creepy nightmare world settings using some of the most frightening ambient sounds in existence (or rather, the most frightening ambient sounds technologically available at the time).  Alright, these tricks were probably used in several horror or science fiction films back in the day, but nobody ever released an entire albums worth of similar effects, have they?  If they have, it surely wasn't 70 minutes long and probably wasn't NEARLY as terrifying as the ambient tricks presented here.    This is where Tangerine Dream deserves credit for Zeit- it's a daring experiment, and I say \\"daring\\" because there was a good chance this kind of stuff would have been immediately rejected by the general public back in the day had Tangerine Dream been as popular as Pink Floyd, and you know, perhaps it was rejected in some areas of the world.  I don't believe Tangerine Dream was popular enough for any rejection to be taken into consideration though (at least, not in America in the early 70's).    Anyway \\"Nebulous Dawn\\" feels like what would happen if bright lights were to shine through my bedroom window one night, and I was then forced to walk outside across a wheat field, through some thick weeds and eventually to these caves where aliens were planning to abduct me.  Incredibly atmospheric.  The weak point is probably \\"Origin of Supernatural Probabilities\\".  By \\"weak\\" I of course mean \\"Extremely cool but the worst song here\\".  The ambience is pretty good but there's a few moments when the atmosphere does nothing remotely interesting.  However when it *is* interesting (such as the first half with the clever use of ghostly shrills and other effects involving these tricks that continuously fade in and out when you pay extremely close attention to the piece- it's effectively breathtaking to say the least) you will be blown away completely.  Some of the ambient sounds remind me of a laboratory of sorts where viral experiments take place, and where bodies are stored or frozen for future studies.  Even a zombie setting wouldn't be out of the question.  Awesome.    Oh, and the title song.  PLEASE, listen to the first few minutes and tell me THAT doesn't remind you of an atmospheric world in a Metroid game (\\"Metroid\\" is a video game series in case you aren't familiar with the name).  The rest of the song has quietly performed ominous waves of unusual ambient sounds with a dangerously thick and intense atmosphere.  I admire it quite a bit.  Zeit may just be the craziest, creepiest, oddest, strangest, darkest soundtrack I've ever heard.  That is, if you were to call it a soundtrack.  It probably doesn't qualify as such, but it sure *sounds* like one.
B000063V8T|5.0|If your talking about best single episodes-- TNG's fourth season had them.  However you want to talk about the highest number of truly incredible episodes per season then you go to Season Five.  'Darmok', 'Hero Worship', 'Reunification', 'Cause and Effect' and so many others.  This is possibly the best over all season of any Star Trek.  There is only one really horrible episode in the whole set and that's 'Imaginary Friend' which seems like it wouldn't have been entirely out of place in season one or two.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you loved Harry Potter then you should read the discovery of witches. It's a different approach to a witch life and also fascinating. It incorporates the vampires, witches, and demons in an exciting adventure story.<br />It all started in a library. Namely,at Oxford's Bodleian Library. The world is full of  witches, vampires, and demons who outnumber humans.<br />A Yale historian Diana Bishop discovers a strange,old manuscript, attracting the attention of 1,500-year-old vampire Matthew Clairmont. This manuscript is the start of all the adventures and troubles that will face these two later on in the story.<br />Diana is a witch (even is she never wanted to be. She has unusual gifts, and she has talents unknown to herself.) The manuscript is strange. It has hidden text and images that only Diana can see and read. Matthew is a scientist. He discovers what is the reason why Diana of all the witches is able to read the manuscript.<br />But the other witches, demons, and vampires are not happy that there is only one person who can access the manuscript. They want to have their own way. They want to decide what to do with the information in the manuscript. Because the manuscript is all about life, the origins of witches, humans, demons, and vampires, and therefore, it also means power - power to change the world order.

0743487486|4.0|Like any parenting book, this one won't be everyone's speed, but my husband and I both enjoyed it quite a bit. It asks the question \\"What kind of adult do you want your child to be?\\" and examines various ways parents might try to reach their longterm goals with their kids.<br /><br />Kohn's ideas can be rather mind-blowing in that he is not a fan of time-outs, sticker charts, and other mainstays of modern parenting and education. He explains his opinions in a very readable and conversational tone and backs everything up with research. If you have tried techniques such as time-out and they are not working for you, you might be encouraged to read some this information. One thing I really love about the book is that Kohn comes from the starting point that most kids are inherently good and that through our parenting we help our children cultivate that goodness. It is a very collaborative style of parenting. I personally am put off by discipline books that assume that all kids are bad and just waiting for the chance to disobey their parents. This book was already more in line with my personal beliefs about raising children.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that this book is not about \\"permissive parenting\\" or letting kids run the house or get away with everything. We have lots of boundaries in our family and feel that the misconception about permissiveness is well-addressed in the book. I just wanted to point that out because I have heard people assume that if you don't (or rarely) use punishment and rewards that kids must be \\"getting away\\" with a lot. This is not the case with us and it would not be a good fit for us if that's how it really was.<br /><br />If you are ready to challenge some things you may have learned or been told about raising kids in the past, this is the book for you. If there are things that \\"everybody\\" does and it doesn't feel right or isn't working for you, this is another approach worth looking into. I think its also helpful if you are the type of person who can read a book and take what you like and what is helpful to you and leave the rest behind. This book is not a manual for radical parenting; nor is it an indictment of more authoritarian styles. It is a collection of ideas that I found to be great food for thought and I think could potentially enrich many families.person who can read a book and take what you like and what is helpful to you and leave the rest behind.

B000OYC7A8|2.0|I think David Gilmour is a real talent and this performance bears that out. Unfortunately whoever mastered this  DVD couldn't be bothered to keep the audio levels constant. It seems every time the performance starts to take off  the audio level drops down considerably and takes the energy out of the songs. It ruins a stellar performance.   It sounds like a monkey is handling on the faders in the mix. Though that's not fair to monkeys. It's a real shame.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|2011's \\"Captain America: First Avenger\\" does a nice job stitching together a superhero's World War Two origins with his future as a member of the present day Avengers, wrapped around a good period action movie with a great villain and some neat special effects.<br /><br />In 1942 Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (an earnest Chris Evans) is a under-sized but spunky straight-arrow kid who can't get into the military. A quirky scientist named Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and gets him into a secret super-soldier experiment run by the gruff Colonel Philips (Tommy Lee Jones) and his lovely English spy assistant Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). The experiment succeeds beyond expectations, turning Rogers into an incredibly strong, fit, and hyper-agile human being. When a Nazi assassin kills Erskine, Rogers discovers what the audience already knows, that the Nazis have their own superhuman, the ruthless Red Skull (Hugo Weaving in snarling full Germanic mode) who has evil designs rivaling those of his boss, Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Rogers is diverted to a war bonds drive as the costumed Captain America, but when he learns from Carter and Philips that his best buddy from Brooklyn is missing in action, Rogers gets into the war in a big way. A series of action sequences set up a big finale against the Red Skull, with a bittersweet ending. Fans are urged to hang through the credits for a nice teaser to the 2012 \\"Avengers\\" movie.<br /><br />With the exception of two brief scenes set in the future, \\"Captain America\\" manages a nice retro feel without drowning in nostalgia; even the high tech stuff looks period appropriate. A brief romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter is handled with commendable and touching restraint. A cameo by Samuel L. Jackson nicely frames the ending. \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is highly recommended to fans of the current series of Marvel Comic superhero movies.
0553801473|2.0|Laborious. After the first 100 pages I swore if I had to read another page full of yet more food and/or clothing description I would retch, and retch I did.<br /><br />Repetitive. I believe I read the precise descriptors of a character and of another character's feelings about an event at least three times over. Yes, the same words.<br /><br />Irritating. Old characters are muddled, dumb where they used to be smart, etc. New characters could be interesting but somehow are not. And WHY must I read yet more about Cersei? She was way too much of the last book; I definitely did not want to read more of her.<br /><br />Angering. When even Daenerys becomes aggravating to read, I know I've waited this series out too long.<br /><br />There is something good in all of this: I'm only as annoyed as I am because I loved the characters GRRM created, and I don't like what he's doing with them. However, I didn't think GRRM would - or could! - write anything to make me dislike Daenerys, but I've been proven wrong.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|nice app....gives you options if you need them but not so many that its confusing. replaced the stock alarm on my HTC thunderbolt, feels like the developer looked st the pros and cons of every other app and fixed all of them.
B000002KON|5.0|Some say it's one of the first rock operas, some say not. Ray Davies composed these tunes around the same time Pete Townshend had composed the tunes for \\"Tommy\\"--this was 1969.  Many of the tunes tackel topics such as suburban life, conformity, as well as a bit of anti-war (\\"Some Mother's Son\\"). The album opens up with one of the Kinks all-time classics, \\"Victoria\\", as well as rockers like \\"Drivin'\\", \\"Brainwashed\\", \\"Shangrila\\" and \\"Arthur\\". Ray was said to have written it about his brother-in-law (his name also was Arthur).
B004YEJGEO|4.0|I was able to get past level 3 with no issues. this is a puzzle game, it takes a little bit of thinking outside the box. (and no I did not look online for a solution) my only complaint is with the prisms you should be able to move both output lights instead of just one. fun game otherwise.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|When it works, it works great. However, after 10-15 minutes it always stops playing and keeps \\"buffering\\" and you have to exit the app or wait for the inevitable force close.     Update: Finally a 4x1 widget! So far there hasn't been as much buffering issues as there use to be.
B0053F042G|4.0|I found the story interesting. A guy has eight minutes repeatedly, in a train that some loony is blowing up. Looking at the plot I kept thinking what if some evil guy got hold of this machine, what could he do with it?    I found the characters fascinating without being over the top. I did very much like the acting by Vera Farmiga, in particular.  I also liked Jake Gyllenhaal too.     I confess, I did not like the ending. I did not make sense with the story and I think it would have been better not to have a typical Hollywood happy ending.

B0050JN88M|4.0|I hadn't seen the Rises Over Japan footage since it's brief appearance on VHS tape (which I rented at my local Tower Video store back sometime around the mid 80's).  The performance is everything that I remember it \\"not being\\"... shame it was an off night!  That being said, for the DVD release they've cleaned it up nicely and given it a 5.1 mix and after all, it is a chance to see Tommy with Purple.    The Interviews and documentary footage are priceless... what a dark period for the band.  Crazy times indeed!    Thank you to the powers that be for putting this release together!
B0050PYNP8|4.0|If Jon Stewart is Gen-X's Walter Cronkite, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are its Laurel and Hardy. With the comedy \\"Paul,\\" the writing and acting duo try to do for sci-fi movies what they did for zombie flicks (Shaun of the Dead) and buddy cop pictures (Hot Fuzz): simultaneously skewer and pay homage to the genres' tropes.     After a brief preamble featuring a very surprised golden retriever, Paul flash forwards to modern-day Comic-Con, where we meet our British heroes, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost), the kind of overage fanboys who swoon for chicks in Princess Leia bikinis and debate the literary merits of fictional sci-fi author Adam Shadowchild (Jeffrey Tambor) in both English and Klingon. After a couple of perfect days in Nerd Heaven, the guys take off on a cross-country tour of extraterrestrial hot spots and wind up having a real-life close encounter with a weed-toking alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogan), who's just escaped from a top-secret military base.     After 60-odd years, Paul, who favors cargo shorts, has apparently outlived his usefulness and is about to have his brain dissected by the federal government. Weaving a complex tapestry of profanity and reason, Paul convinces the guys to help him evade the ominous Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and his boss, The Big Guy (Sigourney Weaver). Along the way, Graeme also picks up a one-eyed religious zealot played by Kristen Wiig, who finds her Christian fundamentalism seriously undermined by the existence of extraterrestrial life.     The movie, directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad), is filled with dozens of clever references to classic sci-fi fare, the best featuring a cameo by Steven Spielberg himself. And as all of the Pegg-Frost movies do, Paul had me in stitches a couple of times -- I'll never look at a bagel again without smiling. But I suspect that the geekier the audience the greater the laughs. I can't wait for Pegg and Frost's take on Harry Potter.     The so-so DVD extras for Paul include an extended version that adds little to the theatrical version, bloopers, feature commentary, and several shots of Pegg making funny faces during filming.  Review originally posted on MyDVDInsider.com.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I bought this based on reviews and I&apos;m really enjoying it. Good graphics and gameplay. Thanks to the dev for a great game.
0345529057|5.0|A beautifully boxed set of some of the best books ever written.  I am proud and happy to own this set.  Delivery was fast, as usual, and the books were well packed and in excellent condition.
0553801473|2.0|I skimmed through other reviews before I started reading this book and I scoffed at them; how could there possibly be so many 2's and 3's for a book from GRRM, author of such literary gold as A Storm of Swords? I finished A Dance with Dragons and I am sad to say I agree with those 2's and 3's. George is off his game with this book, it is ponderous and overwrought, and nothing seems to move the story forward. I understand he needs to \\"position the pieces\\" or whatever the excuse is, but must it take 1000 pages? Did we really need to wait 6 years for what amounts to a filler book? Don't get me wrong, the book is well written and is interesting if you are a fan of the story and the previous books. It has some phenomenal new points of view and the action is gritty and real as ever. Just don't go into this book expecting answers or resolution to anything because you will only be disappointed and left wondering how long it will be before the next one comes out. I have seen what GRRM is capable of, and this is but a shadow of what he can do.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Such a beautiful, well made doll...seems so life-like and my almost 2 year old fell in love with her immediately. Perfect size to carry around anywhere and everywhere. Her mild scent is really nice. I spent a lot of time trying to find a non-toxic doll for my daughter. She has some fabric dolls that non-toxic and are lovely, but she is much more interested in plastic dolls, probably because they are more life-like. It seems there are no completely non-toxic plastic doll, but this doll is made of vinyl and had no noxious plastic smell at all. It is clearly very well made.
1401902197|5.0|I have jumped on the Louise Hay bandwagon looking to find out why I am where I am in life!! I have been in between work for the past three years and needed some help to change this for myself. All her books.CD's has been incredibly helpful. \\"You Can Heal Your Life\\" and \\"Power Within You\\" are both a good start. Once you have read either one of them I REALLY recommend getting \\"I Can Do It\\" book with the CD in the back. I listen to it every day and I tell you it REALLY works and helps you get into the right frame of mind. It covers several topics and you can choose to listen to whatever chapter you want to work on the most. I have already seen results from being unemployed to getting a high paying freelance project and excited to watch what happens next! I have recommened and bought this CD for several friends also!! (Just a quick note, I have bought many of the cd's and I love to listen to them all, but this one is one of the BEST in the bunch should you want to buy one!!) Enjoy and peace be with you!!

B0055CJ8T2|3.0|My first initial reaction to Kelly Rowlands Here I am was disappointment. When i initially purchased the CD I thought that the album would be comprised of vocally charged R&B ballads and dance songs. But I was wrong. This album is mostly very main streamed pop with a little R&B flavor. After getting over my initial disappointment I had to listen to the album 4 times to appreciate it. It is a solid album with alot of dance tracks with alot of catchy tunes that are great for clubbing or working out. All n all this album was decent not my favorite but not the worst.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I was at this show and, just as Shawn Roeder previously stated, the guys' playing was tight and the crowd was in rare form! Scot McFayden and Sam Dunn produced this as well as the band's documentary Beyond The Lighted Stage so this will be a well put together video! I was fortunate enough to be at the world premier of Beyond The Lighted Stage and can tell you Scot and Sam know what they're doing and have a certain reverence for it.<br /><br />Paying tribute to the first city to play their music, the show was filmed in Cleveland and I can tell you the crowd and the band were feeding off each other all night to make it one to remember! This is also the first Rush show to be recorded and released in the USA so make sure you grab this important piece of Rush and music history! My wife and I had floor seats in the center section and there was a camera about 30 feet behind us so, when you watch the video and see the back of the bald guy's head wearing the white baseball jersey with the 11 on the back and Rush above the number, you can say \\"Hey! That's the guy that wrote the review on Amazon about this video! He was right! It's awesome!\\"

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I like this series more than Twilight, but am not anxious to see the films.  The violent nature of the Hunger Games really makes me nervous to see it on the big screen.  As for a great, exciting read, this series is awesome!
B00000F14B|4.0|This restored version added too much material the film could do without ie the characters ending a scene pausing in front of a dark backround, and all the things the residents of River City want from the Wells Fargo wagon. All the best parts of the film are intact, it's just so long you'll have a hard time staying off your fast forward button.
0756404738|5.0|I have not read a lot of Fantasy, but this is truly excellent literature that most people would enjoy.  I love how well the characters are developed and how close I felt to them.  This book is exciting from the first to the last page.  My ONLY critique is the way this and the first book begin and end with the \\"three types of silence\\"... this little narration seems so silly and beneath the great writing it surrounds.      Love this series, can't wait for the next!

B004YEJGEO|4.0|The gameplay is pretty impressive, but at the very beginning, the controls were a bit confusing to use. After all, this game looks very nice for what it offers. It&apos;s well worth the 99 cents if it wasnt the free app of the day, in my opinion.
B003X27L9U|5.0|Fascinating how some people can rate this book as a one star! Boy are they hard to please!   Although it took me a little while to get into this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. What a unique narrative and I loved the world the author created and the ways the boy's mother tried to make his world as 'normal' and as structured as possible. I have to admit to getting pretty emotional in places. Highly recommended
B00005JKLZ|5.0|THE TIME MACHINE is a science fiction romance featuring Guy Pearce as the college professor and Samantha Mumba as the love interest.  Ms.Mumba lives in the distant future, and resides in a primitive vertical village built into the steep sides of a canyon.  The movie features plenty of gee-whiz gizmos.  These gizmos will be the delight, especially to children between the ages of eight to fourteen.  The opening sequence of the movie takes place in a college and in the professor's laboratory, and the viewer is treated to plenty of gizmos, including an early version of the electric toothbrush.  Then, we see the time machine, with its brass fittings and whirling crystalline components.  And then, in the distant future, the viewer is treated to a melange of shelters, ladders, windmills, and other devices, all of wood and natural fibers, which belong to the primitive civilization of the Eloi people.     In my opinion, the first third of the film is the best part.  Mr.Pearce is courting actress Sienna Guillory, in the spare moments that somehow seem to be left free from his busy schedule of teaching and research.  The turn-of-the-century society, as shown in the first third of the film, is one of turn-of-the-century prudishness.  In one scene, Ms.Guillory is shocked (but happily so) when Mr.Pearce kisses her in public.  While at an evening ice skating date, Mr. Pearce presents Ms.Guillory with an engagement ring.  Ms.Guillory is not only beautiful, but her lips and cheeks quivver in a fascinating and fetching manner, in response to Mr.Pearce's interest in marriage.  Any viewer of this display of little twitches and quivverings of pleasure, will be convinced that such is the stuff of movie actors (and not within the achievable realm of any ordinary amateur actor).      At any rate, the viewer's exposure to Ms.Gullory is cut short by a street thug, who slays her by the ice skating pond.  Mr.Pearce responds with an expressions of shock and agony.  Again, such expressions are within the capabilities of an rare and occasional trained actor, and not within the realm of amateur actors.  In response, Mr.Pearce devotes himself to building a time machine, with the goal of traveling back to the past to change what happened.  He succeeds, in part, because he is able to meet Ms.Guillory shortly before her demise, and he succeeds further, by convincing her to travel away from the ice skating pond.  But alas, she is run over in an accident with a horse-drawn carriage.      The film shifts gears, and Mr.Pearce decides to travel forwards in time for an answer, where his goal is still to save Ms.Guillory.  What thus occurs is, at least in my opinion, one of the finest sequences in film history.  The earlier film from 1960 contains an equivalent sequence, but it is clumsy and clunky compared to this sequence in the Guy Pearce movie.  At any rate, the viewer is treated to a particular, static location (Mr. Pearce's laboratory) but where time races forwards by many years.  We see a view of the women's shop across the street from the laboratory, where the style of the fashions displayed in the front window is updated every few seconds, where the hemlines rise ever higher.  We see a bird's eye view of the laboratory, where small structures are replaced by skyscrapers.  Eventually, Mr.Pearce halts his time travel, and finds himself in a modern society where the mining taking place on the moon resulted in an accident where the moon got partially shattered, and is missing a few chunks.      This moon scene is one of the cleverest in the history of cinema, in my opinion.  An engaging part of this movie, is when Mr.Pearce meets an ordinary young woman with her bicycle.  The woman glances at the time machine, parked in an alleyway, and she makes the comment that it looks like a cappuccino machine.  (I like cappuccinos and, to my knowledge, this is one of the few existing jokes about cappuccinos. To digress a bit, it might be noted that Gary Larson has a cartoon about lattes, where a cowboy says, \\"Latte, Jed?\\")  Then, Mr.Pearce leaves the bicycle woman, and continues traveling in time.  The viewer is treated to scenes where thousands of years are compressed into a minute, and we see erosion and canyons being formed with the passage of time.  Mr.Pearce eventually halts in the far, distant future (the year 802,701 A.D.), where he makes an acquaintance with the Eloi people and the lovely Samantha Mumba.  There are many engaging and charming episodes in this part of the movie, when Mr.Pearce gets to know the Eloi people, and where he wins their trust.      Much of the rest of the movie concerns the Morlocks and their evil leader, Jeremy Irons.  While I did not particularly care for the part of the movie featuring the Morlocks, nothing can be done about this, since they are an integral part of the original TIME MACHINE novel.  At any rate, the Morlocks are scary and they jump around like grasshoppers and they chase people, and eventually they eat people (but this eating is not shown).  Then, Mr.Pearce hikes down into cave and eventually confronts Mr.Irons.  To me, this part of the movie was really stupid.  First of all, Mr.Irons just looks like himself but with tons of white makeup.  Aside from the gobs of white makeup, there was no attempt to change his morphology from that of a regular human being.  To conclude, I enjoy watching the first hour of the movie, periodically, perhaps once a year.  The first hour of the movie is a clever, heart-tugging, science fiction romance.
B00004WNZ3|5.0|I really enjoy this album - it keeps on giving. From one Leo to another (8/14/58) this is a grand musical projection of what makes our sign so cool. Spirit, energy, and heartfelt lyrics combine to make what I consider a mature creation from a multi-faceted artist.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|Machete was dumb and politically correct,and yet I still liked it. This was a fun movie, with constant action and as much bloodshed as any movie I have ever seen. Danny Trejo is a Mexican Rambo-type, who kills hundreds of enemies in the most gory way possible. Even less believable, he gets Jessica Alba at the end of the movie. While I watching Machete, I was thinking: Why am I watching this crap? But I still couldn't turn it off.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This is a pretty good movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon. It has good action scenes in it, and the plot is interesting. The end is sad however. It is definitely a guy movie though, most women won't like it due to the hot chicks kicking butt. The dvd quality is great, I don't know about the blue ray disk as I don't have a BR player. The overall package is well done, and there is an option to get a digital copy that expires on June 28, 2012. This movie is worth the price if you like action films with great special effects and pretty women.

PvZ is a polished defense-style game with plenty of upgrades, unlockables, and bonus games to keep things fresh (up until a point).

0596101996|3.0|To me, this book is not easy to read. I only read a few charter. Most of the time, I search information from the internet more than read the book.
1594744769|4.0|Let me lead off with the fact that I get irritated when I get to the end of a book and there's no real closure because the author is setting me up for a sequel, especially when I don't know in advance that that is to be expected.  As I neared the end of this novel and it became clear that I was going to have to wait for a follow-up to have some things cleared up, I grew disappointed.  Otherwise, Mr. Riggs has written a fine novel.<br /><br />As a novel, it is noteworthy as an atypical mash-up of strange, vintage photographs (most of which the author asserts \\"have undergone minimal postprocessing\\".  Mr. Riggs has started from these photographs and created a story that links the photos together.<br /><br />The story Mr. Riggs creates concerns Jacob, the grandson of a man who spent the first part of World War II on an isolated island as a child refugee.  He spent time at the titular \\"Home for Peculiar Children\\" under the care of Miss Peregrine; however, he left early in the war to fight for the Allies before ending up in America.  Years later, for various reasons I don't want to give away, Jacob goes in search of the school and finds out what these peculiar children are all about.<br /><br />As often happens with novels of this type, the story is overshadowed a bit by the cleverness of the idea.  Still, even without the photos, the novel holds up pretty well.  Jacob is an interesting character and the peculiar children are peculiar enough in their peculiar \\"home\\".  Once the reader follows Jacob into believing the premise, it comes together nicely, with only a few sour notes.  If I'm not quite convinced Mr. Riggs has earned his sequel, I'm intrigued enough to give it a try when it comes out.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Fly From Here is rapidly becoming one of my favorite Yes albums of all time - certainly in the top 5. That comes as no surprise to me really considering that Drama is actually my favorite. Unlike what some people are calling this, I don't consider it Drama part 2. Calling it a natural progression from Drama is one thing, and it is legitimate. However, I feel that this release is basically the guys saying \\"Drama was not our most successful so let's try and bring back some of the classic sound\\". And that is exactly what Fly From Here sounds like to me......Drama era lineup sounding a bit more like the Classic Yes.  There is no denying that songs like Fly From Here part IV - Bumpy Ride sounds pre-Drama (although not by much).  Solitare also sounds nothing like anything from Drama - including White Car.    So, what about the title track, which takes up about half of the album? Well, it is certainly a fantastic song. I would have preferred that it didn't have distinct breaks as it takes away from the epic nature of the track(s) - something else that reminded me of classic Yes. I compared the `demos' from Buggles Adventures of Modern Recording to the versions on Fly From Here and while the melody is basically the same, you can see the influence of Yes all over it. That is a good thing.  Same thing, although to a greater extent, with Life on a Film Set which is basically Riding a Tide from Adventures of Modern Recording.    I'm also very impressed with The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be (co-written by Chris Squire with some outside help, including former Syn member Gerald Johnson). I love the fact that Chris sings lead vocals on it although not really surprising since this song is supposedly from aborted Chris Squire solo album sessions.    As far as Benoit David's performance, I think it is nothing short of excellent.  Not much else to say about that. I would just like to see him contribute more to the songwriting.    Probably the most disappointing thing about Fly From Here is the length.  47 minutes is almost unacceptable in this day and age, especially for a band that has not had any new music in ten years (another one my favorites - Magnification).  Only about 20 minutes is not a Horn/Downes composition and while that is not a bad thing, a lot of that is not even really \\"new\\".  I guess I would just expect more from Chris Squire and even Steve Howe after so long. I'm especially disappointed by this considering that there is an extended, or full, version of Hour of Need on the Japanese release.  And from the little excerpt I heard, it sounds fantastic.     While nothing to do with this release itself, I think mentioning Jon Anderson is warranted here.  I don't think anyone in their right mind would doubt that Jon is not only the voice of Yes but also a valuable songwriter. However, people really need to move on and get over the fact that Yes can exist without Jon. How is this any different than when an artist goes and makes a solo album while still in the band? Jon has exhibited nothing but sour grapes with anything Yes that has nothing to do with him. From calling this music `dated' to not performing songs like Tempus Fugit after rejoining Yes (perhaps he forgot that his longtime co-members of Yes wrote Tempus Fugit prior to Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes joining.

B004LWZW24|2.0|Have you seen Poltergeist?  The Changeling?  Jeepers Creepers?  Paranormal Activity?  Darkness Falls?  Dead Silence?  Then you've already seen the best bits that this movie pays \\"homage\\" to.  In other words, nothing new here.  I love James Wan.  He always comes up with something different.  The only thing different here is the concept of astral projection which hasn't been explored so much in movies before.  Other than that, the first part of this film was kind of creepy.  The second part had me saying \\"Really?  James?  This is how you're ending this?\\"  Makes me wonder if there is a sequel coming.  Makes me  kind of hope there isn't.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I paid for this game a few weeks ago. Once I got the hang of it, you couldn&apos;t drag me away. Maybe now that it&apos;s free app of the day, people might start sharing screenshots online. Because some levels are tough.
B004EPZ070|3.0|I honestly read this book with the idea that i would find myself with my next chick lit writer soul mate....I was so wrong.... :(<br /><br />the book itself is well written, but the story goes above and beyond what one should do to a best friend. I cried, and my heart just couldnt stand the background of this story which reminded me of my best friend thru life...even tho our story is not the same the background context is...always her the best in everything and me being the left over. Of course her luck went further and she did get married and i havent, but i couldnt stop for one second to think about her reading this book. It just pained me so much. I read Something Blue and liked it better, but still, the twisted story revolving around all these characters is not something that happens, or if it is, im just glad it hasnt happened to me.<br /><br />Im honestly scared of watching the movie if its anything close to the book.... :(
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I was extremely excited to purchase this movie, as I remember watching it when I was younger. The movie came to my address, which is overseas, very quickly.

0380799006|1.0|I have two children (ages 5 & 7) who bicker way too much and I got this book in the hopes that it would help me identify the causes of the bickering and aid me in reducing it.  If you have a similar problem this book will not help you.  The book mainly focuses on how ignorant parents stereotype their own children into roles which then lead to bad behavior ala the end of the Breakfast Club (I'm a brain, I'm a jock, etc...).  The supposed parents and examples in this book are so one-dimensional that it actually hurt to read them.<br /><br />The fact is the little bit of useful parenting advice in this book is pretty basic, I'll do you a favor and sum it up now:<br />1) Don't pigeon hole your kids into roles<br />2) Try not to show favoritism<br />3) Try to let them work their differences out between them first (and act as mediator/translator if they aren't expressing things well)<br />4) Don't give the agitator attention for being negative<br /><br />These are things that we already do in our house and we still have bickering.  As a matter of fact the author alludes to the fact that you will still have bickering amongst the kids, it will just be handled differently and therefore that's better.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that the book wasn't actually very helpful, I have one big problem with it.  There are several instances of sibling on sibling violence in the book (nasty stuff) and in no part does the author suggest that a parent should actually punish a child who physical harms his/her sibling.  I found this absolutely unbearable.  Our job as parents is to prepare our kids to deal with life's ups and downs and to relate to other's in society.  Violence is never acceptable and to act as though parents are not responsible for teaching this lesson is appalling.<br /><br />Parents in this methodology are relegated to a role where they are supposed to observe, assist, and buffer at times, never lead or teach.  According to the author, our job is to smooth things over and avoid the conflicts among the kids by making them feel more equal.<br /><br />I finished this book feeling as though my questions about why kids fight, what the purpose is, how to keep it healthy, and how to keep it from giving me a headache were not answered at all.and avoid the conflicts among the kids by making them feel more equal.<br /><br />I finished this book feeling as though my questions about why kids fight, what the purpose is, how to keep it healthy, and how to keep it from giving me a headache were not answered at all.
1615890211|4.0|For people who are interested in the pure translation without any frills, this is probably the book. It's in easy to read font, but no work has been put into making the pages attractive to read apart from the usage of paragraphs. The only thng missing are the top notes which in the original version comprise out of a short sentence indicating the subject of the page. A hard but interesting read about the motivations that drove this man.

159448385X|4.0|** SPOLIERS**  (Forgive me if I spell the names wrong)    I thought the book was relatively well written. The beginning was so action packed that I couldn't wait to see how it turned out. It was obvious to me that it was going to be a depressing book, which already set a bad note because I like to feel elated after I finish a book. At first I was confused when the story focused on Miriam then changed completely to Laila. Of course, it all made sense once they were married to the same man. There were surprises along the way, but I predicted that Tariq was still alive and I hate that, which was a letdown for me. It was an obvious twist in the plot and has been used in so many novels. However, it stirred emotions in me. I was very sad - even shed a few tears. I get it..Miriam, after years of abuse, realized that she was never going to have a life of happiness. She gave up that dream a long time ago. At first she was jealous of the attention Laila received from the husband. However, Laila, who was not a \\"bastard\\", was educated and had been raised in a home of equality for women, had dreams that could not be snuffed. It made sense that Miriam wanted to help this girl have a life even if it meant sacrificing her own. She was spent, and while she would have liked to live on to see Laila's children grow, life just didn't have much appeal to her any more.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|This is a handy filter case, with a snap, and velcro to keep it attached securely.

Andy Serkis as Caesar is a tour de force performance and hopefully he lands an Oscar nod for his work here. He is nothing short of brilliant. He looks real. He feels real. There are moments when it feels like you are watching a human brain trapped in the body of an ape. He is that good. The effects by WETA are truly amazing. The action and spectacle are also well done. Emotional, heartbreaking, and always riveting, this is a fantastic character-study film some thought-provoking concepts and ideas.

0553801473|1.0|There might possibly be a good 300-page novel hidden in The Doorstop Previously Known as Dance, but if so, Martin is incapable of delivering it.<br /><br /> I don't find the story-beats to work at all as far as a standalone  novel goes: it seems like a bunch of bad TV episodes. The language is almost unreadably clich&eacute;, and the cliffhangers an annoying joke. It's mostly a pointless meander with the possible exception of the Bran & Arya, Connington & Barristan, and Kevan Lannister viewpoints. The rest are too sparing of anything and everything it takes to make a decent story-line.<br /><br />I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone who isn't already a fan of the series, nor do I any longer recommend the series to new readers unfamiliar with it.  That's because like the last two books in this series, both Dance and Feast, have spiraled down into the dumpster of tedium.  No thanks.

B00006K0BE|5.0|This is an excellent album. The title song, The Man comes around, was really a surprise, and contained words of wisdom and depth. I was also deeply moved by &#34;Hurt&#34; although I had heard it before. This Album is Johnny Cash &#34;raw&#34;,  if you shut your eyes sit back and listen ( on a decent stereo system) you almost feel as if your sitting in Johnny Cash's Living room. There is no mixing of music on this album so if your into all the things digital music has become, you will be disappointed, as this music in this album is simple, but effective. I  purchased this album when it first came out, but my son talked me out of it. I am so glad that I purchased it again, and had a chance to listen to it, especially since this record is one of the final recording made by Johnny Cash. I've purchased two more in this series, and plan to get them all eventually. One of the best albums in terms of &#34;real raw&#34; Johnny Cash.
B004XISI4A|2.0|Reality can be harsh to happy endings. Evil is not always defeated, the hero does not always get the girl, and nobody ever really lives happily ever after. That's fantasy.<br /><br />Take, for example, the tale of a plucky fantasy author, battling to finish his life's work, who overcomes a six-year-long bout of writer's block to at last complete the fifth installment in his epic. It would be nice to think that the book thus produced was worth the wait. That would be the happy ending. But reality can be harsh to happy endings. \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is not the book I waited six years to read, and to wish otherwise would be fantasy.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series was never mere fantasy, but with each new volume, it is becoming more and more a daytime soap opera.<br /><br />Mr Martin famously spent the second half of the 80s working in television, and if I may jump to unwarranted conclusions, this experience seems to have helped him break new ground by infusing fantasy with some of the best aspects of TV--sharply-drawn, sympathetic characters, crisp, witty dialogue, and intricate plotting.<br /><br />He's also made clever use of catchphrases and personal mottoes to provide a kind of leitmotif to each character's story and give a sense of continuity and cohesion to the tale: \\"A Lannister always pays his debts\\", \\"If I look back, I am lost\\", \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\\" More famously, he's gotten good mileage from his willingness to kill off seemingly key characters at surprising moments.<br /><br />Maintaining such a high standard of writing for even one book would have been an impressive feat. Mr Martin managed it for three, stumbled on the fourth, and after 20-odd years working on the series, the fatigue is beginning to show.<br /><br />The personal catchphrases continue to get good airtime, with \\"a Lannister always pays his debts\\" featuring five times, \\"If I look back, I am lost (or doomed)\\" six times, and \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" an impressive 13. However, much of the other writing has become simply repetitive and lazy. The phrase \\"words are wind\\" also pops up 13 times in various character's mouths, \\"much and more\\" (meaning \\"a lot\\") gets used as hefty 30 times, but this is pipped for the number one spot by \\"(s)he was not wrong\\", at a teeth-gritting 33 times. These phrases have become less a leitmotif, more a pianist banging the same three chords over and over again.<br /><br />As part of the series' gritty image, Mr Martin has never been shy about including sex in his stories, but now he appears to be shoehorning it in, simply for its own sake. One character spends the night before a siege having graphic sex. Another pays a surprise visit to one of his generals--and interrupts the latter mid-coitus. A description of a man being burned at the stake takes time out to tell us what happens when the fire reaches his genitals.<br /><br />The habit of killing off characters has likewise devolved into self-parody. Having already killed off most of the expendables, Mr Martin spends most of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" only appearing to kill off characters, but not really. One is apparently executed, but isn't. Another appears to drown, but doesn't. Yet another seems to be beheaded, but--well, you get the idea. The effect is a bit like the boy who cried wolf, and cheapens the book's finale, in which two key characters appear to die, since by then the reader doesn't believe for minute Mr Martin will actually follow through.<br /><br />The other major drawback to the wholesale slaughter among named characters is that Mr Martin spends much time introducing a slate of new characters in much the same way that the old Star Trek series used to introduce new red-shirts.<br /><br />What is left? Plot, but not much of it. Most of the characters spend their time somnolently staggering from A to B. There are sporadic bouts of frenetic action, to be sure, but the story itself continues to plod along, fairly aimlesslyas far as I can see. With no resolution to any of the major plot lines anywhere in sight, it's increasingly hard to care about any of the latest crop of characters, knowing they probably won't live much longer than halfway through the next book (when and if it is ever published). It's only in the handful of chapters that \\"Dance with Dragons\\" shakes off its lethargy and wraps up in a number of cliffhanger endings.<br /><br />I would like to believe the series will get better, that all questions will be answered, all the plot lines will come together, but if there's one thing Mr Martin has taught me, it's not to believe in happy endings.as far as I can see.

B0055IU4GM|4.0|This is a solid album by Hiatt, who will be 59 later this month and is as proficient as ever as a songwriter, even though his voice doesn't quite have the strength it did in year's past. I don't believe there are any truly \\"great\\" Hiatt singles here, cuts that will show up on any future greatest hits collection, but the majority of the songs are satisfying. Hiatt is from the demographic where artists made albums, not just a compilation of random singles, and I really feel the strength of Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns is the \\"whole,\\" not necessarily the \\"individual.\\" This is a collection that should be listened to starting at track 1 and ending at track 11. Those that devote the 51 minutes will be rewarded. Another good effort by Hiatt who looks like he still has the creative spark to continue as a recording artist into his 60's. Recommended.

Abby and Travis's relationship was so flawed and yet so entirely real that I felt like a good friend was narrorating the story of her life to me.  Jamie McGuire has a gift with words and for storytelling that I hope she will never let go to waste, she now has a lifelong fan in me.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|The whole vampire phenomenon is completely lost on me.  With that I went into \\"Let Me In\\" with complete trepidition.  The Stephen King seal of approval didn't help.  Now I can see why King calls this the best horror film in twenty years.  Not as a knock on the film, it plays like a middle school version of \\"Carrie\\".  Director Matt Reeves expertly establishes time and place by placing the film in 1983 snow-swept Los Alamos, New Mexico.  This creates a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the fright factor.  He's ably abetted by the terrific performances of his juvenile leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the tormented young boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the ageless vampire trapped in a twelve year old girl's body.  Smit-McPhee and Moretz, belying their years, make the love between their characters palpable and believable.  You'll shed a tear from time to time even if one of the lovers would rather cut your throat than embrace you.  I find it interesting that Reeves juxtaposes their relationship with that of Romeo and Juliet.  It's kind of an apt one that would almost portend doom for the most unlikely pairing.  \\"Let Me In\\" caught me completely by surprise and is easily one of the best sleepers of 2010.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|Das Boot.  If you like war movies with submarines you should like this one.  One of the most authentic submarine movies I know of.  It presents the U-boat topic from a German perspective.  It shows the human element of the German submariners and invites you to ask \\"what would I do If I were in this situation?\\"  You'll find yourself between a rock and a hard place as you go against what you know is right and loyalty to your country and a cause you don't necessarily believe in.  This movie will make you think.  One thing...if you watch it in English it is translated from German so the lips may not sync exactly.  If that bothers you watch it in German.  Bottom line...I liked it enough to buy it a 2nd time in Blu-ray.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|You can divvy this film into three components.  The first is a no strings attached relationship between the film's handsome leads, Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Secondly, it's a compressed history of the Viagra craze that swept the nation in the late Nineties.  Thirdly, it's a disease of the week flick, in this case Parkinsons.  Separately these components don't stand on their own but as a whole it makes for a relatively satisfying work.  Credit director Edward Zwick for balancing these seeming disparate elements into a cohesive work and making the more sentimental moments less mawkish and the nudity in the love scenes seem less exploitative.  Props also to Hathaway and Gyllenhaal for engendering sympathy for their characters and making them more than self-absorbed yuppies.  The film is not a homerun but a qualified success.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|The beauty of this film is watching these actors of a certain age working together and showing their younger compadres that  old school methods outshine their CGI antics anyday.  \\"RED\\" isn't classic stuff.  It's script is a servicable one about an attempt to \\"retire\\" Bruce Willis' character by any means necessary.  The weaponry is pretty cool and things blow up real good.  The real pleasure is watching Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox riff off each other and have a good time doing it.  I wouldn't call \\"RED\\" mindless, not with these pros involved, but you can park your brain for a couple hours and have a good time.

B0050VI5SI|5.0|I bought this album after hearing \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" on the radio.  I thought about just buying the mp3 single, but I took a chance on the album after listening to the track samples.  I'm very happy with that decision.  Torches is a great summer album with fresh beats and melody and definitely a nice change of pace from mainstream pop.  It is a bit short with only 10 tracks, just under 40 mins. But its hard to find a song that I want to skip and I think they will be in my playlists for a while.  If you liked Pumped Up Kicks and like what you hear from the samples, then go ahead and pull the trigger on this album.
0307477479|5.0|I'm surprised that this novel has received so many poor reviews, as I found it quite meaningful, as well as inventive. Perhaps it is because I am a baby boomer who has experienced some of the melancholy feelings associated with aging and watching old friends grow older and (not always) wiser. This brings to mind a question I had as I read this novel: How is it that someone who appears to be as young as the author, Jennifer Egan, has such a deep appreciation of time, both its good and not so good aspects? Perhaps Egan is older than she looks, but in any case I found myself identifying strongly with her characters and understanding what they were feeling as they moved through their lives.<br /><br />Admittedly, A Visit from the Goon Squad is not a linear narrative and it does take patience at times to keep reading until this roundabout plot makes sense. But that is how life is, and I suspect Egan intends to mirror reality. There are many things that happened in my life that I didn't understand until years later, after I had some distance on the event and was able to put it in perspective. And there were also things that I felt were hugely important at the time which, years later, don't seem to have any lasting impact.<br /><br />I love the music metaphor that Egan uses to frame her story, the various arcs of which remind me of dropping a needle at random on a 33 1/3 LP. You get a snippet of song that is part of the whole, but you may not realize that until you listen to the entire record. I know that this experience is specific to a time when music lived on vinyl and was played with a turntable, so the needle drop phenom is lost on readers who are not familiar with analog technologies. But that is the first thing I thought of when I got near the end of the novel and came across Alex from the book's first chapter, now grown and on his way to see Scotty in concert.  I like the way that Egan interweaves and overlaps the lives of her characters -- six degrees and all that.<br /><br />As for the 'goon squad' title, I love that as well. There is nothing so apt as equating the ravages of time to being worked over by a goon squad.

1401323952|5.0|I have vowed not to make any recipe from a cookbook unless it has a photo.  This book has a photo for every recipe, which was one of te main reasons why I picked it up.  You can tell alot from the photo- does it have enough sauce? Do the ingredients look well paired? Are the colors complementary?  If the photo looks delicious, I figure the recipe is worth making.    This book has recipes that I think my family will enjoy.
1582701709|1.0|Seriously, anything remotely good out of this is common sense and the rest is mumbo-jumbo mysticism crap.  Just the biggest load I've seen since Christianity.  There is NOT mystical force of the Universe that you can tap, it's just you, yourself, and thee.  So many people have just taken this bile hook, line and sinker and they will rapidly find that sitting on their asses just thinking of what they want will only get them a long time of sitting on their asses.  Please please PLEASE just burn this book if possible and go outside and enjoy yourself and life.  YOU are the only power that can control your destiny or empower you to do so.

B004YEJGEO|5.0|A great little puzzle game that plays on colors and their interactions.  This might have a chance of being difficult if you&apos;re colorblind, but even then still worth a try.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Excellent game, very fun and challenging.  Excellent responsiveness on my EVO.  Surprised by the number of levels and clean interface.  Simple to use and intuitive controls (although switching the prism output controls threw me at first).  Kudos to the developers for making a great time waster for my phone.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of thrones is easily the best 10 hours of television I've seen this year and probably ever. All ten episodes are well done and excellently crafted, with superior writing, wonderful visuals and suburb acting all around. This a a true story driven series featuring deep complex characters with traits you can both like and in some cases despise. There are multiple storylines that drag you into a vivid fantastical medieval world. I've watched every episode multiple times and cannot wait for more.     There is much foreshadowing in this series, some of which comes to pass, though not always in the way you expect. There are a number of memorable scenes and plot twists, that truly surprise you and catch you off guard. If you haven't read the books and don't know what is coming, you are in for a treat.    Nearly every scene moves the story forward, and characters are not one dimensional. There is a fair amount of nudity violence and language, but I thought it was well integrated. This is not a show that could have been properly done on prime time TV. There is a actually a lack of large battle scenes, but it is the dialogue and storytelling that keeps this show riveting.    My only concerns about the show are for the upcoming seasons, that they live up to the excellent quality established with the first season. With so many great characters being dispatched in season one, I'm also concerned the flavor of the show will not be the same and thus perhaps not as good. My other fear is that the writing, visuals and acting will diminish with future seasons.     Cgi, music, and filming are all excellent. I could write several pages of everything I enjoyed about this show, but I don't want to list spoilers.    I cannot comment on the dvd or blu ray quality, or extras, but I assume they will be good, and I will purchase regardless.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|this book was the best book i've ever read. the detailed storyline is complex but easy to undersamd. jodi picoult keeps you wondering and hungry for more in this fantastic novel!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is one of the best games I&apos;ve come across. Ingenious idea and definitely engages your mind.. but not so much that you tire quickly of it. This will stay on my personal favorite list!!

B0009W5JS2|4.0|I don't understand all the negative reviews but I feel like I'm in the minority of those who actually enjoyed this movie. Yes, it wasn't the best movie but I still found it enjoyable. If you look at it being just a sequel to the first movie, I can understand one thinking it would suck, but if you look at it as any other action flick without the xXx name attached to it, maybe you might think differently.    Also, people complain about it being too unrealistic. Seriously, like the first movie was more realistic to begin with. Both movies are unrealistic, but if I was looking for realism, I wouldn't be watching movies like this.    Lighten up, people. Sometimes you just have to take things for face value.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Decades from now.<br /><br />Im rarely impressed with anybody these days. New music is usually garbage. Most of it. But Adele is honestly one of the Queens and every single song on this album is amazing. ALL of them. No fillers. No crap. Just 11 fantastic trax that hit your emotions for real. If you cant relate or feel any of this- your simply not human. At least not to me. I hope to see my old age just to see this one held as a standard. I certainly hope it becomes a standard. She is beyond amazing. Shes beyond words. And this is coming from a woman who (myself) who has collected and heard just about everything. Love this chick so much. Classic sounds. Feelings deeper than most can feel.  BUY IT.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Refraction is an awesome, addictive game! I really love it. It is my #1 game to pull out when I have a couple of minutes.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Have only made it to sector 10 so first impressions: engaging, stimulating and with a gentle learning curve.  Recommended.  Runs perfect on my nook color.
B00514K032|5.0|This is a  wonderful story that is incredibly textured and densely woven. Miles is growing up and this book shows Miles as not only a manic problem solver but also a father, husband and son. I really enjoyed the fact that Miles is not in complete control but is starting to delegate. He seems more human, more fallible and I enjoyed the observations of him as seen through the eyes of a child. As usual the support cast is quirky and interesting with fully devloped characters.The multiple viewpoints worked well and I enjoyed Roic's observations about his boss and his job.   And the writing!! LMB observations, comments and descriptions are humorous and insightful with no wasted words. I have always felt that the action in her books is secondary to how her characters deal with the challenges of the situation.  I have travelled vast distances with Miles, encouraged him on through all adventures and often laughed myself sick at the impossible situations he gets in but I like this new Miles and hope we will read more of him and his family. I finished Cryoburn saddened but with a deep feeling of satisfaction.
0143038095|5.0|I loved, loved this book!  I had this book on my \\"book list\\" for years.  I read an excerpt from a International Literature class and vowed to read the whole book.  Amy Tan is a wonderful writer who penned a gorgeous novel about the relationships between mothers and daughters in a culturally confusing environment.  I loved the different interaction between the mothers and daughters in this book, and although my family is strictly from the United States, I can relate to many of the generational gaps, which often separate the women.  I learned in the end, if we allow ourselves, we will have a greater understanding of ourselves through our mothers.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Need a funny replacement for all that bad TV your watching, check out Eureka. Intelligent, quirky writing and loaded with acting talent. The extras on the DVD are great ways to catch up on what your Geek friends were doing and listening to and watching four years ago.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|yes there is, this item completed my expectations, very good, i am so great, it´s ok thank you so much for all everything
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I don't play a lot of computer games. I almost never play games on cell phones. But when I saw this as the Free App of the Day, I snapped it right up. I had played a more sophisticated PC version of this game a few years back, and was hooked.<br /><br />This is a logic and problem-solving game, a game for people who don't like frantic, timed, \\"shoot-em-up\\" style games (which I definitely do not). \\"Refraction\\" encourages thoughtful, deliberate gameplay. Definitely not a game where you just randomly tap around on the screen without any intellectual input from yourself. There is an actual sense of accomplishment when a difficult level is solved, because this game gets difficult fairly quickly. When you are familiar enough with the game's controls, you can turn off the \\"tip bubbles\\" (which are distracting) from the main menu.<br /><br />When you solve a level, you can take a screenshot for future reference (as well as to brag to your equally obsessed Refraction-geek friend that you're smarter than him, and you have a screenshot to prove it!).<br /><br />The user interface is simple and uncluttered. Graphics are sharp and nicely laid-out - this is a very attractive game for those with an appreciation for symmetry, lines and geometric shapes. No annoying soundtrack playing in the background, which is a huge plus for me. Play this for a while, and you'll become an expert at determining what the component primary colors of many other colors are. Plus, you can switch between \\"pigment\\" and \\"light\\" color styles and see how the light beams interact with each other in two ways, not just one.<br /><br />Mr. Spock would like this game. And so will you, if you like games that require contemplation and problem-solving skills to conquer. With 120 levels, and more than one way to solve each level, \\"Refraction\\" will be on your phone for a long, long time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this at the PX in AF, and it works great. It doesn't just work great as a compact sharpener you can put in your pocket, it works great as a sharpener period. It will sharpen any blade quickly, and has the file needed for serrated edges. All in one, and all good. I've used many different sharpeners, from oiled stones, to you name it, and this probably is my favorite overall.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|one of the better free apps of the day. i actually played the demo app a couple of days ago, and now its free. glad amazon is starting to make better apps avaliable for the free one of the day. even if it was not free today i would have bought, get it while you can!!!!!!
B004YEJGEO|1.0|Id rather stab myself in the eye with a rusty nail than play this. Complete waste of my time. Worthless.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Why no zen garden? My friend, who I believe paid the same amount, gets a Zen Garden on his Iphone. Shouldn't Amazon at least warn that this is an incomplete version of the game?  That's my only complaint. Super fun game, but without the Zen Garden, its going to take FOREVER to buy extra seed slots!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|[[ASIN:B004BJMEO6 Elena Undone]] This is by far the best lesbian movie  I have ever seen, the chemistry is terrific , the actresses are both gorgeous and the love scenes tasteful and beautiful, the Kiss well what can you say, just fantastic.
0061998494|5.0|GREAT READ: Full of belly laughs and lifes realities. A guarded success story from a guy who accepts who he is.  I am familiar with Craig's self depricating and raucous humor from his tv show on CBS.  He cracks us up so much, we never miss recording each night.  If we are still eating supper while watching, we often end up wearing some of it due to the guffaws and twists, He's such a naughty boy... I never expected him to share his personal life as he has in American on Purpose.  The self depricating humor is in there, and I believe he is  an authentic kind of guy, no pretense here.         Along with being entertained by words written as if he were speaking to you, I believe there are many truths and life lessons that Craig shares with us. Although most of us may not spend a decade of our lives in a substance haze or stupor, we all have challenges to overcome, and his story reminded me that we need each other. We need to keep on trying to get on with what we truly want to do, we only live once!       As an American I am proud and thankful that Craig became a citizen too. It's still amazing the number of people who strive to be here in our great country, with all it's flaws. He is one of us. It gives him even greater license to make fun of his country, it's leaders, and all of us americans. We need comic relief while trying to get back up again after a rough time!    Thanks for sharing Craig!!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|This game is tons of fun and takes a lot of brain power in order to figure out. Unfortunately it is also very easy to break. On several occasions,  which I began screen shooting, I found myself with prisms that were splitting beams from nowhere and mirrors reflecting colors they no longer have access to. Great game though, and just needs some bug fixing.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I had the free version and loved it! Much better than the alarm app that came on my Droid X. Now getting the paid version as Amazon&apos;s free app of the day is even better! Thanks Amazon ;)
B000MV90JY|5.0|His voice sounds like honey and he's got johnny cash and norman blake and many others. You'll never hear Bobby like this on any other of his albums, not this good in this way. Starting with the remake of Girl from the North Country to Lay Lady Lay to the end, pure brilliance. BTW: I don't know about this pressing but I've got Sundazed Blonde on Blonde and it sounds great.
B001R10BEG|5.0|I've been in love with Big since I was little. Such a wonderful movie. Tom Hanks did a great job portraiting his role in such a funny, lovely and simply adorable manner.   Well, just love it so much!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is a very nice gaming keyboard. My only real complaints with it are that I wish they had provided the ability to change the position of the joystick (which should have been easy with some mounting hardware and a software 'invert direction' setting, and the somewhat poor documentation. There IS a bit of a learning curve to this device, so be aware of that before you purchase it. You will find some oddities to it, such as how you often can't record macros in a game that is in full-screen mode, yet the same macro record capability will work fine if you put the game in Windowed mode, record it, then return to maximized mode.    That said, one great thing is that the device is not game specific. The single biggest use that I am actually getting out of it is that I have hooked it up to Visual Studio to put me in debugging mode attached to my W3WP process with one touch. If you're a .Net web programmer, you know how handy this can be.    All in all, 4 stars.. It's definitely worth the money; just don't expect it to work magic out of the box.. You'll need to spend some time configuring it.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Fun concept, well executed. It&apos;s nice to see physics puzzles based on something other than gravity. As has been said, all the text in this game is quite small and difficult to read, but not impossible. Optimus V, stock rooted.
B000005B0U|5.0|So excited that I got this so fast. There is so much great music on this CD. It was carefully packaged and looked great. Plays great, too.
B000UX6THK|2.0|Received promptly but were frustrated by some faulty discs. We had watched about a third of them when we started having trouble. It felt like a hassle to return and try to replace, especially because we were already engrossed, so we did not attempt to recover packaging and return. We wound up skipping some episodes, and are continuing to selectively watch discs that are viewable.
B000002J5K|5.0|Sometimes the movie is written around the soundtrack. This one was. I love John, I love Dan and together they just rocked sooo much. Play it loud, drive and sing.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I was reluctant to see this so I put off watching it as long as I could. I thought I would hate it. I don't like over-the-top movies that become silly( ex. Kill Bill). My husband finally said I should just watch it first before judging, so I gave in. I'm an idiot! I think I enjoyed this movie more than my husband. Of course there were some pretty corny scenes but overall I really enjoyed it. I know some people complained about Michael Cera being a one-note actor but I thought he did a fantastic job as Scott Pilgrim and I can't think of anyone else who could have played this character so well. The one line,\\"Oooh, girl number.\\" had me cracking up. I also thought the party scene was a riot.<br /><br />I didn't know this movie was based on a comic until after I watched it. I'm not interested in the comic or the comparisons, I just really enjoyed the movie. I'm really picky about what movies I will buy and this one is a definite buy for me.<br />~
B004EBUXSA|5.0|My title contradicts one reviewer's opinion, but this 2nd generation is truely ground breaking! From a programmer, video designer and gamer's standpoint, this processor works well in every situation. I can render HD videos in HALF the time of my q9550! And THAT was a fast one! Gaming uses 30% of the entire processor, usually 100% of a core or two. Programming is great as well, can debug and search faster than ever! You MUST get an SSD to keep up with this thing and use it's full potential! Enjoy, and don't pay more than $275 for it, some \\"centers\\" around here have it for a \\"micro\\" of the price.
B00407PNY2|5.0|What can one say about this movie? A classic the moment it hit the screens. It was the one that electrified the viewer with the prototype car chase. Indeed it became one of the most emulated genre in filmdom. And Ms J. Bissett...whew, again, what can one say?    As for Steve McQueen. He wasn't just cool: he WAS cool. A great loss.
0385736002|5.0|Have you ever wondered what it would be like if all of world mythology came together in one place? Well, you're about to find out, and it's great fun. Two engaging youthful protagonists, a bunch of mysterious doings, and nuggets of historically accurate happenings and characters make this a thrill ride. And the more you know, the more there is to enjoy. Even kids who know little or nothing about mythology will love this; their parents might like it even better. Bon appetit!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|A fun little time waster that makes you think a bit. And free makes it even better!  Those who complain just don&apos;t get it.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|No super-flashy graphics. No obnoxious sound track. No fluff. Just a brilliant, never-been-done-before concept and a close-to-flawless execution. The developers need to work on the logic when too many lasers meet on one prism (occasionally produces a flawed result), but jimmying the prisms usually fixes this quickly enough. Other than that, this one&apos;s exemplory.

B004HO6I2E|3.0|You've seen this movie on countless occasions; Freaky Friday, Face/Off, Freaky Friday again, The Skeleton Key, and Freaky Friday a third time amongst a half a dozen other movies I'm probably overlooking. Body swapping isn't exactly a new concept. Truth be told though, while the idea has been used in an R-rated film before it may be something new to the R-rated comedy genre. Maybe that's why we're taking this rather redundant feeling trip once again or maybe it's only to capitalize on Ryan Reynolds blossoming popularity and have long time fans of his reminisce about their first time watching Van Wilder. The Change-Up is coming whether you like it or not and while it isn't the funniest film of the year or even the most original, it isn't quite as bad as you might be expecting.<br /><br />Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) has been working hard his whole life. He thrived to make work the most important thing in his life and that shows as he's one of the best lawyers in town. Meanwhile Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) has barely worked a day in his life and tends to quit anything when it shows the first signs of difficulty. Dave never seems to have time for anything while Mitch just wants someone to come home to and feel appreciated. So after a night at the bar and a conversation while urinating in a public fountain the two accidentally switch bodies.<br /><br />Raunchiness rears its ugly head not even five minutes into the movie. The Change-Up is probably the most obscene and easily the most vulgar movie of the year, at least thus far. The things that come out of Mitch Planko's mouth, whether he's in the body of Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman, walks a thin line between being profane and being downright offensive. It's so unbelievable that you can't help but laugh at times. The really bizarre thing is that I couldn't help but somewhat relate to the Mitch character. Not so much the sleeping around with countless women part, but his sense of humor, use of vulgarity, and dislike for children. That's basically me in a nutshell.<br /><br />Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds do a pretty flawless job of swapping each other's roles. The roles they both start off with are pretty much the roles we've always seen the two actors play, so seeing them switch it up a bit was kind of interesting. Jason Bateman will always bring a little bit of Michael Bluth with him wherever he goes while Reynolds will probably always be seen as Van Wilder first. That's part of their charm and part of the appeal for the fans that have been following them longer than a year or two. Bateman playing the douchebag is actually a lot of fun though and Reynolds is kind of charming in the nice guy role in an awkward and goofy kind of way. Their chemistry is really the thing that makes the comedy work as well as it does. Leslie Mann also has her moments, which usually come once her husband starts acting like his best friend. This is probably Olivia Wilde's best movie performance in the past few years though. She was so boring in both TRON: Legacy and Cowboys & Aliens. At least in this she gets to show that she's both professional and has a kinkier side while portraying much more emotion than in those two films.<br /><br />The movie progressively snowballs further and further into ridiculous territory as it drudges on though. The scene in the kitchen where Mitch is trying to figure out how to feed Dave's children just about ruined the entire thing for me and the whole Tatiana thing is really stretching it. Each character gets to coach the other while in the other's respective body and those scenes might have honestly been the best in the movie. They were concise and had all the strongest points of the movie in those segments. It's a shame the entire movie couldn't quite hold onto that throughout its duration. With all the fecal matter going into people's mouths, ball cupping, genital shaving, and women being shown on the toilet at inopportune moments, the toilet humor got to be a bitmuch at times and that's coming from a guy who's a fan of that type of humor.<br /><br />The Change-Up is slightly above the mediocre line for R-rated comedies this year. It's slightly similar to Hall Pass with a little bit of Bridesmaids and Your Highness thrown in for good measure. While it is fairly humorous at times, its outrageousness is its own downfall as certain bits are too ridiculous for its own good. However, The Change-Up was still a crowd pleaser and is sure to at least make a modest profit at the box office.from a guy who's a fan of that type of humor.

B0024F08RO|5.0|One of the best seasons. You have the unsuspecting character come in or back (the mother). Lincoln going over the edge because he wants his life and freedom back along with the people he loves and cares about. Michael trying to keep everything together and finding ways to get his brother, nephew, his girlfriend and his friends their freedoms along with his. So this is a very cool season, there is more to it then that but it is still so very cool!!!

B002S0OBMS|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" 1986 musical is a whimsical fariy-tale. \\"Love Never Dies\\" brings Roul, Christine, the Phantom, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry down to our Earth, and into our socity, and in our socity people REALLY DO change that much over ten years, I know because I have lived over ten years. Meg kidnapps Gustave, Christine's and The Phantom's son, and almost drowns him. When Christine, the Phantom, and Madme Giry arrive to save Gustave, Meg, saying she feels unwanted points a gun at her head, But when the Phantom tells her the most obvious thing that she will never be like Christine, instead of just admiring her friend, because of the latter fact  or shooting and killing herself, because of the latter fact, she shoots and kills Chistine! This sounds like premeditated murder. Though this is sad it carrys two great morals. the first being life sucks! deal with it in a constuctive manner, please! Because the Phantom deals with life through his music, and does not kill anyone in the sequel, Meg deals with life through distucive behavior. The second one is fame is dangerous, goes without explnation. Though the morals are hash, the story, because it is about characters from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" deals with these morals, in a safe and confertable way. However I do not think this musical should be viewed by those under thirteen.
B0053F042G|3.0|I pretty much got through this movie because it was playing in the background while I was surfing the net. Had plenty of WTF-factor in it, but I have to wonder... the whole ending?
B002D0L0R2|1.0|\\"Hairspray\\" is already a story with LARGE amount of emotion from racism, and teenage rebellion, and adding songs explodes those emotions, until they block out the characters who are having them, and all you get is show stoppers. Meaning, songs that KEEP the story from moving on, and only repeat what the story has already told us, until after the song is over, because the songs are so GREAT. \\"Without Love\\" is the best example of this, \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" being the worst example.<br /><br />During \\"Without Love\\" Tracy and Penny are rescued from their prisons, and taken on a car dive, to a record store. There seems to be no fear, among anyone singing, of what happens if they get caught, because the lyrics do not tell that OBVIOUS part of the story. I mean, Penny is running from her Mom, who tied Penny to her bed, and Tracy is on the run from the police, so you would think there would be more tension, than this relaxed, happy, song, that barely makes sense.<br /><br />The singers are lip sinking to a soundtrack, and I should not be able to tell the reader this. \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" which takes Tracy to school, because what she singing is happening, sounds like your watching a silent film while listing to it from your boom box. (However,\\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" sounds MUCH better on Hairspray (2-Disc Collector's Edition Soundtrack) [Box set, Collector's Edition, Enhanced, Extra tracks, Soundtrack] the BEST thing about this musical is THAT soundtrack)<br /><br />\\"I Know Where I've Been\\" is the emotional, musical, and lyrical depth I was expecting out of \\"Hairspray.\\" However there is NO reaction to the protesting going on during the song, and the story stops until the song is done. Still the song does make a good point about protesting, it's emotional NOT political. If every song had been done like \\"I Know Where I've Been\\" regardless of the song's individual genres, it could have been a phenomenal musical, but \\"Hairspray\\" the musical is too popular the way it is for it to fixed, at this point.  Every musical needs some songs whose sole purpose is to move the story forward, not be a showstopper. This book musical, has none.s point.

0439023521|5.0|My daughter was assigned this book for summer reading.  I often read the books my kids are assigned so I know what they are reading at school.  I expected to be disgusted by this book just because I knew the basic plot: kids who have to fight to the death as a form of entertainment in the future, a very disturbing idea.  Well, it turns out that basically the fact that it is disgusting and inhumane is a large part of the point of the book.  The story is well written, the characters get you hooked.  It reminded me a bit of Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\", and Heinlein's \\"Tunnel In the Sky\\", though the overall story is quite different.  Nice to have a strong female protagonist in an SF book, too.  In the end, much to my surprise, I strongly recommend reading this book!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|The title pretty much says it all, this is an incredibly fun game that I couldn't put down for several hours after downloading it, and I will definitely be doing so again shortly.
B0036T31YY|3.0|I hate to admit it, so here goes: I was drawn to this film because  Melissa George was the star. There, it's out in the open and I don't   care who knows.   The title may have been off-putting (just how many crappy bermuda   triangle films have sunk without a trace is anyone's guess) but this   little gem of a film took me by surprise and sucked me in from   beginning to end, back to the end, to the beginning and back again.   George's performance was excellent and a testament to how far she has  travelled as an actor over the years. This film is a bloody good romp  and with references to Memento it needs another viewing. Again.  Mind you, any film with Melissa George is worth watching from back to front.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|I don't know for sure, but I couldn't find a way to make the display larger. I can barely read the instructions on the screen.   My finger is too big to move the refractor thing around. Maybe this is for iPads.. I don't know.  I am uninstalling.
B004VMVTNU|2.0|This an alarm clock app. If your looking for something to cook you breakfast its not for you. I have every faotd and this is a repeat. It&apos;s still free. I think I speak for the rest when I say the fake dev reviews are not influencing anyone to purchase this app. Maybe spend a little of your wasted review time developing some new features for your app that would bring a higher rating.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|This was a well put together micro-budget, indie film. I thought that overall the film making was a step above the writing. The story was a little weak in parts and the ending was a little more bland than I had hoped. There will be obvious comparisons to Zombieland and The Road. I think it is a good mixture of the two, which again is saying allot for an indie. I thought the acting was excellent overall. Nick Damici, Kelly McGillis, and Michael Cerveris were all strong, but I thought the part of Martin was portrayed as a little too naive and innocent for a modern day teenager. The real story here for me was the gritty and dark environments, along with the awesome vampire makeup and effects. I've seen much higher budget movies that don't come off this good. If you are a horror fan, then run out and buy this! It is worth seeing, if not just for the opening scene in the barn with the baby. The Blu-ray has some really good behind the scenes stuff, and the overall picture quality was excellent.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Puzzles are challenging and varied. Controls are good. Clean graphics. All in all, I enjoyed this game. Easily worth the money. HTC Incredible.

B002ZG999U|2.0|2010 had 2 action films that were populated by old-time actors. RED was outstanding, and this one, in which it seems like all the actors think they're still matinee idols. When the film starts, there's no end of listing the producers, associate producers, executive producers, etc. Red flags immediately went up in my head. I tried really hard to keep an open mind, but the script was so bad, I couldn't believe what was presented to me. It's a dark film, and it's intentions are geared entirely to the action audience that's looking for 'splosions 'n stuff. I'm sorry but this one just didn't do it for me. It simply wasn't entertaining. As an alternative, I would most highly recommend RED, old guys going crazy and having as much fun as their audience.

159514188X|5.0|If you've lived under a rock and haven't gotten around to reading TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY yet like I did until recently, THIS IS THE BOOK WORTH GOING OUT INTO THE BIG AND SCARY WORLD! Yes, you heard me. This book is worth your life - and his life - and her life - and everyone else's life.<br /><br />In other news, TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY is amazing AMAZING.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, Hannah captures my attention as Clay listens to her tapes and unravel the reasons why she found nothing left to live for. Her narrative is haunting and beautiful and unforgettable, and the saddest part is that I know that we would have been the greatest of friends because that is how much I connected with her personality. She sounded like an amazing girl with so much to live for, but her hopes and dreams suffocated as the pressure of vicious rumors and bullying never let up - and NO ONE realized how much she was hurting.<br /><br />Which goes to show how much each of us can stay inside our little bubbles, maybe sharing space occasionally with a neighboring bubble, but never long enough to get hurt or show hurt. The perspective of Clay brings an additional richness of emotions to Hannah's tragedy, and I truly have to commend Jay Asher for choosing to write this story from 2 perspectives. Here is a guy who is among the reasons why a girl ended her life, but as I watched Clay go through the tapes, I realized that he may not be 100% bad guy. I mean 1/13 of the problem, but still... Clay's reactions makes this story whole. He cannot undo the past, but Hannah's honest last reflections has influenced how he lives out the future.<br /><br />I realize I am truly fortunate to have had a mostly positive high school experience, and bullying never seemed to be much of an issue. To read books like TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY and some girls are and also the news that confirm these books are based on real occurrences - it makes me worry what we are feeding the children. Was bullying always this bad? Has it gotten worse, and why? What messages are we unknowingly relaying to these kids? Am I truly that buried inside my bubble that I never realized how awful the world has gotten?<br /><br />I know that I definitely have to re-read TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY because I have not digged deep enough yet into the layers that Jay Asher set down with great care. Which is saying a lot because I don't usually feel the urge to dive back into a book for more meaning - and for some reason, TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY makes me want to get back in the dirt and grab hold of all the buried treasures!ssages are we unknowingly relaying to these kids?

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have loved this series, particularly the first two, since they came out. I had wanted this collection to get the Bluray versions. When I watched the movies, I couldn't happier to see that they contained dramatic improvements over the original movies (which is no small task). The original one looks like it was shot all over again - the quality difference between this Bluray and the old DVD I had was phenomenal. For the third movies, the added scenes really made the story richer for me. All in all, one of the best DVD sets I've seen in a while.
B004047XXO|1.0|This movie is AWFUL in this format!!  The so called 3D is not in a format that works with the 3D televisions on the market today. Hardly makes the $3,000 dollar investment in a 3D flat screen worthwhile. A total waste of money!!!
B000006YO2|3.0|From 1973 till 1994, Ferry had 9 recordings. To make a best of, I bought all nine, used for around with shipping, $50 and with my little recording studio, made my Best of Brian Ferry, and it´s just fantastic. I am doing these a lot these days to the fact that most artists, or the companies that own their music are usually, lousy compilators. They should do their homework. Anyway, it´s worth it...
B001AIRUOU|4.0|Excellent movie and the DVD came in excellent condition. But the digital copy? it EXPIRED AUGUST OF 2009. Don't buy it hoping for that
B0051CSI0G|5.0|Excellent movie done by an independent director. I can't speak for the picture quality of the dvd but, on Blu ray this movie looks Excellent. If your also a film student and into horror this movie is worth picking up for the movie and the packed extras. The director has over 2 hours of behind the scenes and pre stories of each charactor. Watch the movie first then enjoy the extras for the full experience. The behind the scenes give an insight on the type of budget the director had to deal with and what the cast wen through to make the movie. I am so glad to see movies like this and directors who can show their talent to make movies like this. I just wish more movies like this would get noticed in big hollywood. Hats off to everyone who was involved with this film. After this movie was over my only 2 questions was will the director be able to do a sequel and will Mister be back?
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite all time movies.  It builds on the charactors, and though they where at the time our enemy I             was certainly rooting they would survive and make it home.  This being a true story, was results of two patrols, fiction couldn't be more intense. I prefer the extended version due to some of the small details brought out. This certainly doesn't glorify war and shows the price the people pay in their lives, in war. I find that most adults enjoy this film even though it is long and watch it to its conclusion.  If you enjoy the movie read the book, which it followed closely.
B00003CXB6|1.0|The quality of the dvd was fine. Picture quality was good, case was fine. My son is a fan of the Jurassic Park series. This movie was the worst of the 3. I would not recommend buying this unless you are just interested in having the set.
0452289963|5.0|Not everyone will be drawn to this kind of thinking and consciousness, but for those who have always suspected that this life is as a dream within a larger part of Being you may find, as I did, that this is one of the most important books you have ever read. I suspect that it was with great effort that Eckhart Tolle spent the time and focus to organize and write this book and I am so grateful that he did.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Let me start off my review by saying I'm not fond of most current music and artists. However, I heard a lot of chatter about Adele and her 21 album, so I decided to sample it and see what the fuss was all about. Let me tell you, the bang to hype ratio is on par. What a refreshing, honest, emotional album that speaks from the heart.     Anyone who's had a broken heart (or even broken a heart) will feel this album. Adele doesn't need auto-tune, special studio effects, or hardly any instruments backing her. Her voice is so powerful and full of emotion that it can (and does) stand on its own. You can feel every note she sings, and not many artists can do that. I can't say enough about her voice--just breathtaking.     The production is simple, but very effective. I love that they didn't \\"trick\\" up her voice, they just let her belt away and give the songs all they needed. In an age of auto-tune (there's that word again) and studio trickery, it's SO refreshing and WELCOMED to hear a true talent be allowed to shine on her own.     The songs are all about her past heartbreaking experience(s) with the game of love. It's not whiny or overkill--Adele is able to convene heartache/hurt/pain from a lost love in so many different ways. This is what sets her apart from the rest. For example, in the song One and Only she \\"dares\\" her love to \\"give her a chance to prove she's the one who can walk that mile\\", where in Someone Like You, she's resigned to the fact that her love has moved on and found somebody new, but wants him to know that she hasn't. That's just two examples of what Adele is able to do with seemingly one theme.     As you can tell, I absolutely love this album--it's the best album I've heard in years, it's that good. Don't just rely on my word, give the record a spin and see for yourself what a true talent Adele is. And while you're listening, I dare you NOT to feel the emotion of the album.
0812973992|5.0|Excellent book. This book is filled with wonder and Colum McCann can be admired and respected for both the idea of such a book and being able to accomplish it in the writing and organization.  I became attached to his characters and thought about them after the book was finished --- obviously the mark of master writer.  This book seems to be  a metaphor for the \\"tight rope\\" of our lives, the tenuousness, the magnetic lure for balance, the courage to proceed without knowing, and of course the backbone for it all -- the inevitable, insatiable, necessary longing to give and receive love.  Great reading!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Lots of choices if you like to listen to the radio. No matter where you are you will always have your local stations available.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Lady Gaga's second album is noticeably different from the first, in mood and in thematic content. I was not in love with it on the first listen, but on the second listen, I began to see the light, and each successive listen has made me appreciate it more. I say this to make the point that anyone who gave up after one listen because it was not enough like \\"The Fame\\" is missing out on something special.<br /><br />It is a rather dark album; not all dark, but in my opinion the darker moments are some of the best ones. \\"Marry The Night\\" is mainstream dance music, which sounds innocent enough, but the lyrics say \\"I'm gonna marry the dark/Gonna make love to the stark/I'm a soldier to my own emptiness\\", so this is no ordinary night out. On \\"Government Hooker\\", the unique identity of this album really begins. It takes us into a sort of underworld, and to support this, it has a very nasty, I would say menacing, bass groove, with the voice of \\"Government\\" saying things like \\"Back up and turn around/Put your hands on the ground/Get down.\\" \\"Judas\\" is one of many songs which feature religious references. It has a rock/disco vibe, behind lyrics such as \\"Jesus is my virtue/And Judas is the demon I cling to.\\" \\"Americano\\" is a Hispanic sequel to \\"Alejandro\\" from \\"The Fame\\", but it is less playful, more desperate.  \\"Scheibe\\" adds German to Gaga's linguisic repertoire, and the music is rock/disco like that in \\"Judas\\", with more bass groove similar to that in \\"Government Hooker\\". The lyrics have a feminist edge: \\"When I'm on a mission/I rebuke my condition/If you're a strong female you don't need permission.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bloody Mary\\" is one of my favorites on the album. It is slower and quieter than the other tracks, and it has obvious, although ambiguous, religious allusions, such as  \\"When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne/I'm ready for their stones.\\" I also like Gaga's vocal quality on this track and on \\"Electric Chapel\\"; I would describe it as more subdued, smoother, sweeter. There are dark sounds and visions in \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"Electric Chapel\\", two more of my favorites. In the first one, \\"Red wine and cheap perfume/And a filthy shout\\" accompany the night's amorous activities in which \\"A group does it better\\" in \\"a full house of leather\\". In \\"Electric Chapel\\", love is more intimate and even mystical, beginning with \\"My body is sanctuary/My blood is pure\\", and ending with \\"I need something sacred from you/Down on our knees we'll find a way/To make a pure love work in a dirty world.\\" The sound of both tracks is appropriately dark and serious, with plenty of electric guitar in \\"Electric Chapel\\".<br /><br />There are other highlights, not necessarily dark ones. \\"Born This Way\\" is a retro-sounding dance number directed toward those who feel like outcasts from mainstream society. Likewise, \\"Bad Kids\\" is both an affirmation and a defense for Gaga's younger fans. I'm not sure what \\"Highway Unicorn\\" is all about, but the lyrics are lots of fun, about a girl who is a \\"free soul burning roads with a flag in her bra.\\" \\"The Edge Of Glory\\" ends the album the same way it began, with an exuberant mainstream dance anthem. Overall, I doubt that this album will be the \\"monster\\" of commercial success that \\"The Fame\\" turned out to be, but I do believe that it will enhance Lady Gaga's reputation as a hitmaker and songwriter. The incorporation of  themes that are more complex and more \\"adult\\" shows a growth that would be missing if she had set out simply to duplicate her earlier success.e dark sounds and visions in \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"Electric Chapel\\", two more of my favorites.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|\\"There's a fine line between genius and insanity.  I have erased that line\\" - Oscar Levant    There's a reason for that quote, and it'll be apparent as you read through this review of Yes' fine release, \\"Fly From Here\\".   Hands down, this is he best release since 1994's \\"Talk\\" and the most progressive since \\"Drama\\" in 1980.   It's the first to feature new singer Benoit David (who does a superb job), and the return of one of my favorite keyboardists of all time, Geoff Downes (who also does an incredible job).  Coupled with THE Yes guitarist, Steve Howe (who truly makes this album special), and the solid playing of Chris Squire and Alan White, FFH is a joy to behold, because it's the first album I can truly sounds like the band I've loved since I was 12 (OK, I'll date myself here, that was in 1973).  This is no Close To The Edge (then again what is?  That's like expecting another Lark's Tongues in Aspic from King Crimson; those were once in a lifetime albums and their like shall never pass this way again).  This is no 90125 (clearly no arena rock anthems here), nor is it Drama (the heavy and in your face playing is not here).  It is rather, a combination of all of them to varying degrees.  It also has that unquantifiable sound that is Yes.       The true stars of this album are clearly Howe, BD, and Geoff Downes.  They did the right thing in getting Geoff back to play on this album, because in all reality he's the only keyboard player who could bring the old tunes back to life, breathe new life into the newer compositions, and create the atmospherics with beautiful work on the pads as well as lovely melody and leads.  He is truly incredible, and for my money he's the guy who's the glue that holds it all together.  He was born to play on this recording...period.  It's one of his masterpieces in his long recording career for sure.  BD FINALLY can step out of Jon's very long shadow and sing in his own key at his own pace.  Sure he can sound like Jon at times, but he alsohas his Trevor Horn moments, and those moments that are distinctively his.  My only gripe with the playing is the rather pedestrian drumming by White, and average bass lines by Squire.  By no means are these guys bad; they are serviceable at the moment and do a good job, but given their talents they could have done a hell of a lot better ESPECIALLY because the music is so damned good.    The longest epic that Yes has ever written, clocking in at around 23 minutes, is the title suite \\"Fly From Here\\".  While it is cohesive on one level as a whole musically, it can also be argued that it is comprised of several songs stitched together by a common theme conceptually rather than musically.  And you'd be right on both counts.  Geoff and Steve both manage to connect the various parts with nice segue playing of their own.  The odd meter intro section leads into the beautiful and soaring \\"We Can Fly\\" where BD's vocals shine.  There is some great playing by the entire band on this piece of the suite, but then it leads into the incredibly beautiful \\"Sad Night At The Airfield\\".  It has an almost longing, mournful, and sorrowful feel to it, but the lovely acoustic playing of Howe and nice bass work of Squire add to the feeling, making it a very ethereal piece.  This is followed by the sudden shift into the odd meter introduced at the start of the composition via the Overture, \\"Madman At The Screens\\", but a full band workout with vocals this time.  Almost as a coda inside the suite and before the end is \\"Bumpy Ride\\" which leads into the main theme reprise ending what is now one of my favorite long form Yes compositions.    Next up is a rather poppy tune by Squire , \\"The Man You always Wanted Me To Be\\"; a nice song on it's own, but it really doesn't belong on this album (at worst) and is in the wrong order (at best) on the album.  Perhaps Steve Howe's solo piece, \\"Solitaire\\" might have been better here, but it's absolutely PERFECT where it it.  It comes after the slightly adventurous \\"Life On A Filmset\\", with its interestingly eerie start, but then it quickly changes into this driving tune led by Geoff's beautiful keyboard work.   This song almost seems to have been a part of a suite itself, but on it's own is yet another moment you realize the Downes/Horn influence on this album (especially since most of the title suite was written by both of them).   \\"Hour Of Need\\" is a sweet little song on the Domestic release but it's a tiger and an almost completely different song at that on the Japanese import.  There's an extended percussion workout for Alan that starts the song off and then the band launches into a majestic piece led by Steve's driving guitar...all which leads us into the regular shortened version of this song.  It's a lovely song, and I can't help but think what Crosby, Stills, and Nash would do vocally with this song.  Nice playing by Steve and perfect percussion by guest Luis Conte (who played back on a couple of Asia albums in the John Payne era) provide the background.  Nice pads and atmospherics abound courtesy Geoff's keys, and the short little solo is what Oliver Wakeman leaves from the original sessions.  Then rather then end as on the Domestic release, there is another beautiful Steve Howe driven guitar solo coda that highlights just some of his magnificent playing on this album.  I prefer the long version of the song (having bought the Japanese SHM-CD), but the short version is just fine as well.  The album ends with the aptly named, \\"Into The Storm\\"; a fantastic band piece where all the members contribute beautifully and you can really see this one being a barn-burner in concert if they extend it all into solo-land.  But it's a great song and ends the album on a high note.    As far as the production goes, it's a Trevor Horn affair, which means crisp and clean production and that's the case here.  The former lead vocalist for the band back in the Drama days also provides some backing vocals throughout the album (I hear him a lot on the title suite) as well as being the mastermind behind the first Yes album in a DECADE.  That is a LONG time to wait, but it was well worth it as this is a fantastic disc.    Genius and insanity?  Indeed...because there is a bit of both styles of playing from all parties on here.  As I said, it's nice to finally hear Benoit David in his new element, and to have Geoff Downes back on board (in addition to his duties with Steve Howe in Asia) is a big plus.  Overall, I couldn't have hoped for better considering all the turmoil the band (and the world) has been through the past decade.  I highly recommend this album, and I'd urge you to spring for the Japanese SHM-CD pressing if you can.  You get the longer version of \\"Hour of Need\\" as a bonus track (in addition to the shorter version); what you also receive is magnificent sound quality above and beyond the call of duty.  It's simply magnificent on the home theater system, computer, iPod, iPhone...name it.  It's stellar sound in any format.  Highly recommended no matter what country of origin...it's a new Yes album and FINALLY I can listen to the music without quizzical looks as I did the past few Yes albums.    This one put a smile on my face...finally.  I hope this line-up stays together for a couple of more albums, because they certainly can work some magic when all the cylinders are clicking...and on \\"Fly From Here\\", they are.

0743243153|5.0|\\"The Road Less Traveled\\" by M. Scott Peck is a book that I will read more than once, which is the highest compliment that I can give. It was first published in 1978 and has sold 7 million copies. This is a spiritual and intellectual masterpiece covering topics such as discipline, love, growth and religion, and grace. The fact that his very first fan letter was from someone who assumed that Dr. Peck was a life-long member of Alcoholics Anonymous is reason enough for the recovering addict or alcoholic to read this book.<br /><br />  Dr. Peck has much to say about honesty in the section about discipline. He states that a life of total dedication to the truth means first, a life of continuous and never-ending stringent self-examination, second, a willingness to be personally challenged, and thirdly, it means a life of total honesty. Of people who live this life of total honesty he says, \\"Through their openness they can establish and maintain intimate relationships far more effectively than more closed people. Because they never speak falsely they can be secure and proud in the knowledge that they have done nothing to contribute to the confusion of the world, but have served as sources of illumination and clarification. Finally they are totally free to be. They are not burdened by any need to hide. They do not slink around in the shadows. They do not have to construct new lies to hold old ones. They need waste no effort covering tracks or maintaining disguises. And ultimately they find that the energy required for the self-discipline of honesty is far less than the energy required for secretiveness. The more honest one is, the easier it is to continue being honest, just as the more lies one has told, the more necessary it is to lie again. By their openness, people dedicated to the truth live in the open, and through the exercise of their courage to live in the open, they become free from fear.\\"<br /><br />  In the section on love, Dr. Peck maintains that true spiritual growth can be achieved only through the persistent exercise of real love. And true love is not a feeling, it's an action. Most of what we call love is just plain dependency, a force that causes people to fiercely attach themselves to one another. But this type of love constricts and traps rather than liberates, and if you expect another person to make you happy, you'll be endlessly disappointed.<br /><br />  Among many other illuminating ideas is his notion that God resides in our unconscious, that our unconscious mind is God, and that this is no different than the Christian concept of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us. Interesting.<br /><br />  I could go on and on about this book. It's one that has significantly altered my view of life and my place in this world. I would like to thank Dr. Peck for sharing these illuminating insights with us.<br /><br />David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"ieved only through the persistent exercise of real love.

B0001I561Y|5.0|I bought this set because the movie alone was $40!!! So why not save a few bucks and get some extra's! The book was well made, the slides are in great condition and the movie...well, it's Aladdin :)  Came in great condition and we have  been enjoying it ever since! If you're going to buy the Aladdin movie, just buy this...it's cheaper and you get a few extra little things :)
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Kid Rock's last few albums have had a somewhat eclectic mix of songs. This album seems to be a collection of the type of music that I love from Black Bob. I get a sense of who may have really inspired him as an artist - Bob Segar, Bad Company, and Hank Williams Jr. I enjoy most of his songs, but this album is the best yet. And what a price!
1849025975|5.0|Having now gone through Homage to Catalonia, I don't see how one can properly appreciate 1984 without having also read this book. This account of Orwell's time fighting in the Spanish civil war in 1936-1937, written immediately after the event, contains two threads. One is about Orwell's time at the front, presented in his typically effective matter-of-fact manner. The second concerns the internecine struggles of the revolution in Barcelona, pitting anarchists, republicans, socialists, and communists against one another in the 'events of May' and in the purges that followed - purges of which Orwell almost became a physical victim. As the introduction by Julian Symons notes, Orwell would remain a man of the left. But after the communist party destroyed the POUM, whose militia Orwell had joined, he could no longer believe in communism as a system. As the party and the republican government that was under their control imprisoned and shot the 'Troskyist' POUM members, vilifying them as Fascist spies, so did Orwell's journey begin towards Animal Farm and 1984. This is the watershed that must be read to understand the end point.    Incidentally, Antony Beevor (The Spanish Civil War) confirms what Orwell wrote of the communist campaign of lies against the POUM. This was worth checking, since Orwell himself writes that he is not a neutral observer, and the foreign press wrote things up quite differently at the time, gobbling up the party's blatant defamations. Also of note is the oddly-chosen title, since Orwell ignores the role of Catalonian independentism, which historians tend to make more of as a political factor. But this was, as pierces through the page, the age of world-sweeping ideologies. To be read both for its pulsing action and for its insight into Orwell's ideological transformation.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The hardest math problems are still too easy, needs to be calculus, integration or something (I am apparently still solving the hardest in my sleep).  Other than that it is the best alarm app out so far!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|this is easily the most engaging game so  well suited for touch screen. shout out to the developer. should try.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Really fantastic app. Learned so so much, and the videos are done enthusiastically and really made me excited to cook.
B00005JLSE|5.0|For those of you who think Chicago just appeared out of the Harvey Weinstein mega-cloud, this musical was a very successful and long running broadway play which featured the late great broadway dame, Gwen Verdon (wife of Bob Fosse) and Chita Rivera! I purchased the broadway cast recording back in the mid 1970's. then bought the book. Yes,once upon a time, you could purchase the book with lyrics! and when the early 1980's came along, there was talk about doing the Chicago play into a movie that would have starred Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn. I wish I knew why that movie never transpired, but If it had been made, then this current Chicago movie would have been a very successful remake! Boy, how I wish the Minnelli/Hawn version had gone through! Even though I cannnot sing or dance, I can still sing, dance and talk all the parts. After all, I've been doing so since 1975! Whether you're a fan of musical movies or not, you must check this one out! The Men will certainly enjoy the scantily clad female prisoners! So, let the men drool while the women are fixated on Richard Gere's amazing dancing feet!
B004SKHJF2|2.0|worked fine before even though the listen screen always stayed in portrait mode. since the last update, it force closes every time you hold the phone in landscape mode and try tagging. turn the phone to portrait and no problems. Droid X 2.3.3.  dropping my rating from 4 down to 2 stars until fixed.
B003L20IHE|5.0|If you've ever lost someone you were close to, be it a parent, sibling, relative or a friend, at some point you wish you could have just one more moment, just a little more time to be with that person. Charlie has that chance with his younger brother who tragically died in an automobile accident in which charlie was the driver. Grief stricken, charlie makes a promise to his littler brother to meet him at sunset every day in the same spot. Unforseen circumstances changes all that. but I will say no more! this movie will not only tug at your tear ducts but will also make you think about saying how much you love someone before it's too late! I highly recommend seeing this movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is fabulous and disturbing all at the same time. It has a big message about society becoming complacent about violence, especially violence against and among children. Definitely a classic in the making.
B000068OSK|4.0|Album very good however, not their best in my opinion get icky thump much better in my opini  on
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|I really like this one. These songs just simply rock. It almost feels like Mr. Big never left. The songwriting is strong and there are plenty of fun lyrical and melodic hooks. Paul Gilbert's riffing is just rocking and grooving with Billy and Pat chunking along underneath. The opener \\"Undertow\\" is a good smack in the face to start things off. \\"Nobody Left to Blame\\" and \\"Not Enough for Me\\" just slam and rock. But my favorites are tracks 9, 10 & 11. They just get my blood pumping every time. This one's been on regular rotation in my player since it came out and I really cannot wait to see them killing this stuff live.    All that said, the production is almost bad. It's boomy, overwhelming and over-produced. The levels are too high or something. There's no subtlety and I really hate that every time I listen. Boosting the highest high, the lows and mid-lows on the EQ seems to help, but I cannot believe this could get released as is. It's a true shame, it could have sounded so much better.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I have yet to see a Christopher Nolan film I didn't love. \\"Inception\\" is refreshingly original and a welcome film in today's re-boot/re-make plagued film world. Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece thriller with an exceptional cast to back it. The last film I saw that was this original was \\"District 9\\". I also love Hans Zimmer, but I felt that his last film with Nolan (The Dark Knight) was lacking. The score felt as though it was always building and your senses never had a rest because there was not resolve to the music, even at the end. That was not the case with \\"Inception\\". This score is beautiful and engrossing. It accompanies the film perfectly and resolves at the end. This film forces you to keep up with it. Its fast-paced and will confuse you if you stray for even a second. If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and get it.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Very original puzzle game, but I wish there was an option to turn off haptic feedback.  I also wish there wasn&apos;t a 20 word minimum...
030746363X|4.0|I loved Ferris' \\"4-Hour Workweek\\" and it really changed my perspective in certain major areas of my life, but I can't quite say the same about this book. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is an excellent read, but I didn't find it as \\"profound\\" and I did the other book. There are some very interesting discussions and very compelling studies that are illuminated throughout. This is definitely a book you can read at your own pace. I would pick and choose sections to read and I didn't necessarily follow the order of the table of contents. It's quite a long book too. Much more so that \\"4-Hour Workweek\\". If you're a fan of Ferris' work definitely pick this up. You'll definitely learn something new and interesting.
B000002H4C|5.0|The CD came in excellent condition. All the tracks play great with no problems. I am very satisfied with the item. There are several tracks that I think stand out: Heavy Metal (Take a Ride), Reach Out, Open Arms, and Radar Rider    I believe that both the animated movie and soundtrack are classics, and still have a passionate cult following after 30 years. However, if you like \\"ROCK,\\" the soundtrack is good enough to stand alone.    Dave Godfrey
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|The most recent movies in the Predator and Aliens series have been lacking a certain sophistication and thrill that made the first movies so terrific - that is not the case with Predators. This is a fantastic thrill-ride with superb acting. There is a great story in this script and that's what makes it so great. If you loved what made the original Predator so good, definitely get this!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I am happy with it, works as the listing says. We run several different OS systems in our firm and the cable runs well on all of the them. And from the time of order to date recieved was faster than what was first stated so it arrived early. The prices was also better than local shops even with standard shipping. Great Buy
B004YEJGEO|5.0|great, fun and challenging game!! People, don&apos;t leave low reviews because you don&apos;t know how to read directions. I have a MyTouch4G (with a 3.5&quot; screen) and I can read them just fine. Keep it up devs!!!
B005CMSDLE|3.0|\\"Hanna\\" is a moderately entertaining movie, worth viewing just for the terrific acting by the trio of Cate Blanchett, Saoirse Ronan, and Eric Bana. But ultimately, I can't give it that high of a rating because it lacks a heart and soul, and despite being a two hour long movie, the many action sequences squeeze out scenes or plot points that would have let us understand or feel for the major characters.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan reprises her ongoing roles as a young teenaged girl on a journey of discovery. She has played this part before, in \\"City of Ember\\", and \\"Lovely Bones\\" and is a terrific actress. Here in this movie, her hair and eyebrows and eyelashes have been bleached nearly white (she is normally a natural light brunette), giving her an ethereal quality, almost like a fairy or a wood elf. The difference in this movie is that her character is not a normal teenage girl, as we soon discover, and so she has this flat and emotionless affect through most of the movie.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, what to say except that she is again wonderful, playing this fiercely evil CIA agent. Blanchett has been one of my favorite actresses after her role as Galadriel - I couldn't imagine anybody else playing that role ever again.<br /><br />Eric Bana has never been one of my favorite actors, as he seems to have cornered the market on roles as earnest but ultimately failed heroes. But he is an excellent actor.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action sequences, with lots of running. The change from one scene to another is herky jerky, as we jump from the wilderness of Finland to an underground fortress in Morocco, to a tourist campground in Morocco, to Berlin, and then once in Berlin, from a rundown amusement park to her father's apartment, to her grandmother's apartment and then back to the amusement park.<br /><br />The action is also excessively stylish as if it were supposed to mean something. Why have the final denouement in an amusement park, starting in a house styled like a gingerbread fairy tale house? Why have Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey? I mean, won't that give him away?<br /><br />The movie left tons of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end. The motivations of the two adult antagonists are left only partially answered. Just why was Cate Blanchett's character chasing so hard after her quarry? And why did she do all those awful things in the past? The only answer given by Eric Bana's character on his motivations for what he did is wierdly simple and unsatisfying: \\"Because kids grow up\\" (like duh, but don't you think a good father would want his beloved daughter to have something better in life than become a pre-programmed assassin?).<br /><br />At the end of the movie, I could say only that this movie was entertaining but not memorable. Like Saoirse Ronan's character, the movie was so busy running that all the heart and soul and motivations got left out.ve Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey?

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is not only a survivor, but an amazing person. She was thoroughly honest about the Hell perpetrated upon her by the monsters who stole her from her loving family. I couldn't put it down--read through it in a day.
B004ZZLX5W|5.0|Loved the album and could not wait for the deluxe edition. Great Buy: includes two new tracks and a digital download of a remix of Ready to Start and the Sprawl I Demo.  The album also has an updated version of Wasted Hours that has a new ending that I find fun and true to Arcade's style.  Very pleased and would recomend to anyone considering buying the album.  Go For It!!!
