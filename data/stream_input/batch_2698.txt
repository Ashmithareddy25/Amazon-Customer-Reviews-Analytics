B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a great story. It may not be as inspirational as the author hoped, but the story of Nikola Tesla is amazing.  This man would not give up and he gave so much. If you want to read a story of a great man, this is it!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My family totally loves this show. We have watched every episode over and over and over again. It never gets boring.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Wife and I both like this movie so much we had to get it. Really gritty tale with outstanding performances. It's a good one to own
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|One of the Marvel Hero franchise - and one of the most likeable.  Kids over 13 would enjoy it the best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's by far the most spectacular and exciting game I have played in a while. It's challenging and fun all at the same time. Thank you for making such an awesome game
B005MMY9A8|4.0|good video, yes comic book fairy tale, realistic  new world with treachery and deceit, loyalty and true friends, good for youngsters too.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I enjoyed the book overall, but too many disappointments simply left a bad taste in my mouth. First of all, the price of $13.53 for an ebook (Kindle) is simply obscene.  I'm still kicking myself for paying that.  I adored Ms. Clare's Infernal Devices series (Clockwork Angel, Clockwork Prince...), and with the movie coming out for The City of Bones, I talked myself into paying that steep price for this book. It's not that the book was bad--in fact, I enjoy Ms. Clare's style of writing--it's just that it's simply not worth that price and I feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />Secondly, the `surprise' near the end spoiled the overall feel of the book for me. I'm usually a fan of big revelations in books that catch you by surprise. However, if the shocker takes away all the fun, squashes the romance and leaves me with absolutely no desire to continue on with the series, then I have to wonder about the point of it. If I had only stopped reading this book at about 80 or 90 percent, then I would have given it 4 or 5 stars, but alas, I didn't. So I ploughed ahead, and, bang! The revelation came and swept the air from the sails, completely taking the fun away from the story. I was so disappointed. It changed everything.<br /><br />Aside from that, Ms. Clare has a knack for creating vibrant characters and storylines that leave me turning page after page, completely absorbed in the world she's created. Her style of writing is crisp with just the right amount of imagery to sweep me away.<br /><br />If I can find the next book in this series at a reasonable price, then I'll continue on. However, I will never pay that kind of money again for a series that leaves me so utterly disappointed.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of action. Really thought it was a good movie.  Loved the chosen cast and would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies mixed with a little comedy.
B001KZG99A|5.0|So I am the only woman in a house of boys and men. As you can imagine, superhero stories are all the rage in this house. Not only does my husband take everyone to the movies when they come out, he buys all of them on blu-ray so they can watch them ad nausea afterwards. I've resisted their urging to participate in all this craziness. Until now. The boys insisted I go with them to Iron Man III. I said I couldn't because I hadn't watched the first two, expecting that to solve the issue. I was mistaken. After a week of hounding, I finally agreed to watch the first two so we could go as a family.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself completely engaged and entertained. Robert Downey Jr. has created a character who is egotistical and self-centered, yet intelligent and worthy of your respect. If you've watched him in the Sherlock Holmes movies, you'll find similarities. I found those equally entertaining.<br /><br />Of course what we used to call &#34;special effects,&#34; before they became a standard Hollywood tool, are key to telling the story. I sometimes feel as though Hollywood relies too much on the digital world but in this case, they are not so much an addition to the story, but central to it.<br /><br />If you are looking for great film-making, you might peruse some film festival winners instead. However if you want a few hours of fun to escape reality, this is a great choice.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I love this game but the server goes down A LOT and right in the middle of play.  The other annoyance to me is the treasure chests aren't near as frequent when you get to higher levels and additional pearls are now nearly nonexistant in them...they either cost a pile of pearls to open or a pile of sand dollars and it TAKES away more than it gives or lackluster amounts of algae.  MUCH more enjoyable before the updates.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Very Nice Wireless Gaming Headset. I like about the when you change your voice, no hissing sound, clear sound. What i HATE is the battery doesn't last long
B005LAIIMG|3.0|A friend of mine talked me into trying out this one.  I was very unsure, having been just about \\"zombied\\" to death--and most of them not good at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I have not read the book, so this review is based solely on what I watched at the cinema.<br /><br />What starts off as any normal morning becomes anything but in a very short while.  Brad Bitt, with wife and two daughters in tow, begin some sort of holiday, but a monkeywrench is thrown into their plans almost immediately because of an outbreak of some sort of virus that is turning people into crazed maniacal zombies.  There is no known \\"Patient Zero,\\" no idea where the virus originated, and certainly no cure.  Pitt's character used to work for the UN in some sort of capacity, and he and his family are saved and taken out to sea for protection.  Pitt is asked to head up a team and search for the origin (and cure) of this disease.  Along the way, there are stops in South Korea, Israel, and Belarus.  Pitt's character comes up with an idea that might just save the world--or at least give it a little time longer to work on an antidote.  I won't give anything else away, but I will say this was one zombie movie that at least I could buy the premise.<br /><br />The acting is this movie fared much better than its script.  The plausibility of Israel seeming able to defend itself against the zombie attack long before anyone else and then not knowing to put the kybosh on their \\"hoedown\\" was just a little unbelievable.  And I left the movie wanting more--much more.  Coming in at just under two hours, you would have thought the story would have all been there, but the movie seemed to end just as it was starting to take off.  I'm sure most of you wanted more blood and guts (there is very little of this, by the way), but I was okay with the story taking precedent over the effects.<br /><br />World War Z is rated PG-13 for language and violence, and believe it or not, there's not that much violence.  I recommend viewing the movie, but I just wished it would have been a little better.lence.  I recommend viewing the movie, but I just wished it would have been a little better.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Story issues aside, this book doesn't overwhelm you with storyline the way 'The Hunger Games' or 'Catching Fire' did. Maybe it was a poor storyline, maybe not, but its seems like two books were shoved into one, and neither of them was fully developed. I would have loved to have seen 100 more pages at least in order to understand what the heck was going on. The final chapters are incredibly predictable and the finale leaves you wanting. If you need closure to the series, and I did, then go for it. If you weren't wowed by 1 or 2...then let 3 go.
B009L32R5I|5.0|a must for any genesis fan and especially any Steve Hackett fan love it allot of work thanks Steve .
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved the story so much that I couldn't put the book down, there's drama and heartbreak as well as love and a good history behind it
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Is a master piece of the art.  It should be recommended for schools and submit students to criticise this king of art.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. If for no other reason than its minions!!!!!! Unfortunately my kindle doesn't seem to like running it smoothly.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is the first in the King and Maxwell books and a must read if you continue and also watch the television series.  It gives the background of the two former secret service agents.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great to use as a brain exercise! Challenging and fun. Can not wait for more levels! Hurry up with more challenging levels!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I love this movie !!!! I can see this movie each year it the most beautifull thah I never seen
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game on kindle fire 7 HD. My only problem is loading time. Other than that, fun game. Whoo hoo. Fun fun fun
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle app is the best puzzle game ever.  If u don't have enough time at home to do puzzles, this app is for u.  I like how u can change the size of the puzzle to just your difficulty.  I also like how u can seperate the end pieces by a push of a button and u aren't wasting your time separating them.  I LOVE THIS APP AND RECOMMEND FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I recd this book and had completed it in two days. It so totally absorbed me. I learned what North Korea really is like, quite apart from what news reports had taught me. My prayers are more realistically based now. This will be one of the most memorable and disturbing books I have read. I want to recommend it to  everyone I know.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Do not get it other ppl might think it is good but I don't like it<br /><br />it's just like the first one sucky
0786958731|4.0|I had never played D&D before nor any tabletop RPGs for that matter so I didn't know what to expect, but this game is most definitely entertaining. Moreso if you're a fan of Drizzt's adventures. It's fun getting to relive his adventures with others who not have read the stories themselves. Also the game is fairly easy to understand after a little reading and a few practice play-throughs. I've played with tweens so age isn't as much a factor either. I highly recommend this game.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The movie came as advertised in package and wrapped. When I played the movie there were no scratches and/or the movie did not skip. ALS it played in English like I wanted
B001MS7IBS|4.0|It came and the scratches were obvious so I am playing each disk works ok before i add to collection. so far so good. 4 stars.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|I like the graphics as well as the background noise.  I find it a good problem solving game - you can see the gems, but how do you get there!?
B002CMQS1O|5.0|This movie is laugh-out-loud funny. The actors nail the whole declining rock group-on-tour. The song lyrics and musical performances are hilarious, as are the deadpan performances in between shows. My favorite scene: the latest drummer giving his interview in the bathtub, while wearing a shower cap.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Loved this game so c heck it out.  The first time I played just could not stop fun for everyone
B00722ZHG6|5.0|A lot of these songs are covers, but she does them well in her own renditions. Worth hearing the whole album if you like even one of her songs.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It's the DS version, plain and simple. The controls are worse, and they took a few things out, but other than that... I was very disappointed. It was overly simplified and just boring. I love Scribblenauts, but this was horrid.
1781162646|3.0|After reading some of the five star reviews I'm amazed. But maybe it's the five star reviews that convinced me this was going to be spectacular when it was just average. This is definitely NOT a thriller in any sense of the word. It's barely a mystery. What it is more than anything is the story of a young man growing up while working at an amusement park. It is warm and you do find yourself saying I remember when I was young and thought that but those are not the kind of stories I come to King for. This is just another reason why I don't read King that often. After experiences like The Stand and Pet Cemetary I just don't want to soil those memories with any more mediocrity.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it's amazing  one of the best games I ever played it's like temple run but even better
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is fab like I totally love it it is so much fun I could play it all day long
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I didn't catch &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; from the beginning and I regret my decision.  Of course, on the other hand if I had watched from the beginning I would have been addicted for my weekly fix. I've watched &#34;The Sopranos&#34; and &#34;The Wire&#34; and consider them to be two of the greatest TV series of all time.  &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is in the same class as those other two.  Thank goodness that AMC decided to show these again from the beginning. People like me now have an opportunity to catch up on all the &#34;Badness&#34;.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Its rare for me to love every track on an album but this one has delivered! Truly a wonderful album!
B001L7TDQ8|5.0|For those who enjoy the music of the Strauss family, particularly the waltzes and polkas of Johann Sr. and Jr., there is probably no better time of the year to hear and see them performed than the first day of each January. Since 1939 is has been a tradition in Vienna for their great Philharmonic orchestra to delight their audiences with an all Strauss, or nearly all Strauss concert. The venue for these performances has been the home of the Vienna Philharmonic, the Musikverein, and its wonderful Golden Hall. Ranked among the very best in the world for its marvelous acoustics, this guilded masterpiece of sound engineering continues the architectural theme of the outside of the building, designed in Greek revival architecture in the late 1860's by the Danish architect Theophil von Hansen. The hall seats 1,744, with standing room that can accommodate an additional three hundred. In years past, particularly under the baton of Willi Boshovsky, between 1955 and 1979, the Viennese tradition became firmly fixed in popular imagination as the concerts were broadcast on Austrian public radio and television, and rebroadcast around the world. In some years the New Year's concerts were held in the ornate hall of the Vienna State Opera, located a short distance from the Musikverein. In more recent years the concerts have been directed by guest conductors, and in 2009 it was Daniel Barenboim who was the invited conductor of the Philharmonic for the year. In the United States these annual concerts are regularly broadcast  by PBS as part of its Great Performances series. 2009 also marked the bicentennial of the death of the equally famous Austrian composer, and conductor, Joseph Haydn in 1809. Barenboim, in planning the program, selected as the last work in the performance to be the 45th Symphony of Haydn (in F harp minor), in tribute to that much beloved \\"Father of the Symphony\\".  One should read up on the history of how this symphony came to be written to fully appreciate the great\\"theatre\\" as well as wonderful music  that accompany each performance, and Barenboim and the Philharmonic are more that up to the task. It's great fun to watch such a live performance.  Three encores complete the program and the last two selections are also a Viennese tradition at almost all music concerts in this cultural capital of Central Europe. They are the \\"Blue Danube\\" waltz of Johann Strauss II, and \\"The Radetzky March\\" of his father.  The latter requires rhythmic clapping to the cadence of the march by the audience, and every concert attendee in Vienna looks forward to participating in this \\"event\\" with eager anticipation.  The initial broadcast  and  this DVD is a production of ORF, Austrian public television, and includes special features that showcase some of the dancers from the ballet of the Vienna State Opera, as well as a video tour of Linz, the industrial capital of Upper Austria, as part of its 2009 celebration after being named the European Cultural Capital for that year by the European Union. Inner-cut with the regular program ORF has included video scenes of two of Austria's southern federal states, including its wine country and spectacular Alpine scenery. If one wants a delightful tour of Austrian culture, then this is a great way of experiencing it.  Lacking only a slice of the layered cakes so much associated with the Viennese, like a Sacher-torte, and a cup of savory coffee from one of the city's many coffee houses, this is definitely worth the trip.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it, I referred it and those persons loved it enough to buy it. Every girl likes a fantasy, this is it! Waiting for the next installment, bring it on!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Another great book that I could not put down. Nicholas sparks sure does know how to write a good book!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|What a surprising and entertaining movie! I loved it! Anthony Hopkins is very good, I almost didn't recognize him and Hellen Mirren is wonderful as well!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book brought me to tears more than once. It had me laughing and crying hysterically while every one was at the beach. The story of a ten year old boy gave courage new meaning and showed that eventually, if you are kinder than necessary, the universe will even things out by giving you the best fate a far from ordinary boy could ask for.
B008VBYN80|2.0|Did not like it, to dependant on facebook and other players. Way too little action to be fun. Expected more battle.
B0097AQEG8|2.0|one or two pretty good tracks, but mostly not so great.  It's too bad since Bright Lights was so excellent.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This is not a stupid movie. Cloud Atlas is a thinking man/woman's movie beautify filmed and given to revelations of the heart and mind. I cannot help those who's minds wallow in shallowness and confusion, who due to the lack of senseless explosions and mayhem, cannot understand the beauty of this telling. My only suggestion: Watch it again.<br /><br />Paul Harry, author The Garden, The Unauthorized Biography of Adam and Eve.
B00000IM2R|5.0|killer album all the way through. really one of the best ever, a must have for any vinyl collection. buy it now.

B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was hard to figure out who was telling the story.  Jumped around. not an easy read. would not recomend
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It was a fun game to play with the kids not to fun after about 30 min, it should be for young teens

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My family friends &amp; I are completely addicted.  Can't wait for the new levels.  We had fun working as a group from age 5 to adult.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I just started watching this tv show recently so I hadn't seen many of the earlier episodes.  If you need a laugh, just turn on an episode of the Big Bang Theory.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|It's challenging and very addictive. I would recommend it for all ages. it can be played when you only have a few minutes, so very convenient
159463176X|3.0|Hosseini is a good writer but this time he takes one thither and yon through time and characters.  It takes real concentration to figure out just where you are in this multifaceted drama.  In the end it was worth the struggle to keep focused.  Unfortunately, my husband gave up on the story.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I bought it at 99 cent hihi very cheap and I waited it for sale a long time thank you devs
B005D9MUWY|5.0|You won't find a better application for typing and for word prediction. I won't ever use anything else at this point and have no plans to ever change that
B006MPKD54|4.0|The third &#34;Bosch&#34; book i have read. Just like the others, you are quickly captivated by the story yet the book delivers another late plot twist that I did not see coming, yet found a little hard to believe. (Not as hard to believe as &#34;The Black Echo&#34; which I also gave 4 stars. I would probably rate this a slightly better read and very enjoyable.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The undeniable truth of a movie is, \\"The kids keep watching it over and over.\\", this is our second copy. The first one got worn out.
B005HSL626|4.0|Good game to play on my phone and pass the time while travelling on the metro, plus my kids love it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My 4 and 6 year olds wear these things out.  They play it over and over. I just don't see how they don't tire of it, but they don't.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Read  this book cover to cover all at once! Story kept me on edge and guessing the whole way through- what a thrill ride!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Once again for me, this movie was enjoyable mostly because of the &#34;cast of characters&#34; in it - Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, etc.<br />It was an &#34;action&#34; movie, which is not normally what I seek out, but this one has a touch of fun and humor and a James Bond type quality where not everything (not much) is believable! Also, for me it was a bit hard to follow the thread of what was going on and why...the action and fast pace of the film, and moving from city to city where you were thrown into a whole new scenario, was difficult for me. All in all, I liked it. Not sure if I will go to see &#34;Red 2&#34; which is coming out soon. Maybe 1 is enough.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Flawless transition from The Name of the Wind. Incredible storytelling with an unparalleled flow to it. This, among other things, made it damn near impossible to put down. I can't wait for the next one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I love this book because you were able to get into all the characters and you felt like you knew them. It was a touchy subject but dealt with nicely. I had a hard time putting it down. I highly recommend it. You won't be sorry you read it.
B003L77GG0|4.0|Good to see Clark all grown up and facing the darkness within. Enjoyable season with a nice story line and characters.
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|...even if there is not one iota of chemistry between them. (They really do make for an unlikely couple.) BUT, I love this movie for two character actors who steal the show: Gig Young is hilarious as Grant's sidekick and John Astin is creepily funny as a twisted lothario who works at the unemployment office. Oh, and Doris does have a couple of scenes which are laugh out loud funny, both involving physical humor - at which she was very adept. A good old fashioned comedy worth a second look.
B00887490Y|2.0|Had the makings of a pretty decent horror movie for a while but the \\"twist\\" was pretty ridiculous. The message of the movie seems to be that it's worth kidnapping kids and sacrificing a few people's lives here and there to avoid having those kids raised by poor white trash. A nice backhanded slap in the face to people who \\"cling to guns and religion\\". But of course the movie is right on point...all of society's problems would be solved if only everyone were raised by people with money. I mean, look how well those nice Kardashian girls turned out. How about for the sequel the tall man interrupts abortions and takes those babies to some well off parent(s)? Or perhaps just run with the same plot but have it set in Harlem or Compton with the children of poor black families being taken? No, no...liberal Hollywood doesn't take shots at their own.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I thought this movie was just fantastic.  No destruction, no extreme violence and most of all a wonderful story.  PI is much more than the ratio of the circumference/diameter!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the graphics might not be the best but it is still the best game in the world<br /><br />I love it this game is awesome
B009ZQJ0ME|2.0|wow, i stopped watching this movie somewhere around the middle.  i might get back to it but i do not think so
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|A true classic!! Story telling at its finest,  it takes you to that place and time in a well written and heartwarming fashion.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I use to love this app. Played it for hours. Then I received an update which said that they had added more puzzles. I was thrilled until I downloaded the update. It is terrible!!!!! The puzzles are so hard to do now because the pieces move all over the place when you are trying to connect them. I wish I could get rid of the update. I have tried everything and I can't. So I never play anymore and it WAS the best jigsaw puzzle app on kindle untill THEY RUINED IT WITH THE UPDATE....
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. I found it interesting to watch the life choices made by [Christopher McCandless] and how they led him on his journey. I did wonder, during certain parts in the movie, how the writers decided to put in certain things based soley on the information they gleamed from his journal - for instance, the bit when he was obviously remembering/acting out an argument between his father, mother and himself during the scene when he was trying to light the fire to smoke the elk meat. It just didn't seem to fit with the 'reality' of the story.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Great shows. I always loved MacGyver....and now we have the freedom to watch whichever ones we want. Great! Thank you, Amazon.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Got this for traveling back roads of France following the Tour. Wanted to be able to charge two smart phones on the go.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The settings and locals were so perfect! I could easily fit the visuals with how I saw them in my mind while reading the book. Toasted the end it does sway a bit form the book, but overall it is fantastic!
B0049IWQJW|5.0|Cars is such a great movie with a great cast. I can actually watch it repeatedly with the kids without wanting to jump out the window.
B0000047CX|5.0|I bought this for my husband who grew up in Brazil and he loves it.  Very sensual and soothing and you can't miss with the classic &#34;The Girl from Ipanema&#34;.

B00B7IJDMA|5.0|There is a couple of slow songs but its still a very good soundtrack. i have no problems ordering directly from amazon because i always know i'm going to receive my order. i like the fact that not only do i get an actual physical cd but before i received it they had already loaded it onto my cloud player so i could enjoy it immediately; no wait required.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|If you've seen 1 & 2 you gotta see this one! I couldn't find it anywhere else and it's good quality too.
0811875555|5.0|I don't think it's possible to put into words just how much I love Tangled. Ever since that movie has come out I've been captivated with the characters, scenes, and the fantastical elements of the movie. I'd love to have a career with Disney myself someday and thought that it'd be really interesting to see how the original concept for the movie altered and developed throughout the time that the artists were working on these now familiar and beloved scenes and characters. From the villain to the wonderful lantern scene, everything is explained and shown in detail. I loved getting to see the different stages of brainstorming for everything as well as the beautiful works of art that led up to the actual making of the movie.<br /><br />This book would be perfect for any fan of the movie or any Disney fan in general. I can't draw anything but loved getting to read about what the artists went through to capture the personality of the characters and the general themes of the movie within their settings. A reader and a writer can still get a lot of fantastic information from a book like this, especially if they're a fan, because it shows that these things that are so well known didn't exactly turn out perfectly the first time around.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be looking into getting more of these art books because this is something that I'll flip through from time to time and maybe learn something new every time that I glance through it. It's just such a joy to see all of the hard work and dedication that goes into a movie like this, a movie that inspires so many people, like me, in so many ways. It's easy to tell in every page just how these artists have put their heart into the project.<br /><br />I really recommend this book for any Tangled fan. It's a fun and creative insight into the creation of the film that I'll keep with me forever.
B003L20IJM|5.0|While it is not quite as good as the first one, and Margie Gyllanhaal can't quite pull of being British...it is a good film  One the entire family can enjoy!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this post-apocalyptic story. Must see. Lessons to be learned and thought provoking. Get your canteen and roast up some cat for a glimpse of might be.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I was late to Castle.  It airs on a channel I don't usually watch at a time I have another show I like to watch.  This was a very important episode, the end of season 4, in the story line and so far I haven't seen it rerun on any secondary channels. This was a good show and easy to get through Amazon.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|This is the fifth Jack Reacher novel ( if you read them chronologically) and by far the most 'cinematic,' so far. The pacing, structure and characterisation is similar to a movie - maybe Reacher film two ??? Great story that hooks into a pertinent contemporary theme - namely the militia movement in America. I liked it a lot.
B0007TKNII|5.0|One of my favorite musicals of all time! Love love love this dvd.  Couldn't believe the was Gerard Butler. Blew me away.
B00028HBKC|5.0|THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT. DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ON THE BIG SCREEN, BUT IT WAS CLOSE.<br />THEY SHOULD MAKE MORE FILMS LIKE THIS TO BRING ABOUT PEACE, HARMONY AND FORGIVENESS IN THE WORLD.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time and it was free!  Will continue to read over and over and better still watch the dvd over and over.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Strip clubs, F bombs and violence up the ying yang. I had to delete it because my son is way to young for this garbage.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Can't go wrong with Downton Abbey.  Got this before the TV series finished and watched it all at one time.  Can't get enough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Intrigue and fun just the right amount of challenge<br />I enjoyed playing y I g  the game<br />To be fun without being too difficult<br />Would recommended  to others to play for light entertainment
B002ZG9800|4.0|I am not a fan of JIm Carrey's comedy movies. In those so-called roles, he is an over-actor and basically does a series of facial contortions. The movies where he actually acts are ones that I generally enjoy. This is one of those movies. I recall that during the very brief time that this was playing in theaters that there was a bit of an uproar over gay sex scenes. There is one, and it is certainly not explicit. This is based on a true story about someone whom I had never heard of before. It was quite a story and enjoyed it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00B8MMZY8 Anker® 18W / 3.6A (2.1A + 1.5A) Car Charger with Built-in Micro USB Cord for Android - The First and Smallest Adapter to Deliver Simultaneous, Full-Speed Charges to iPads and Smartphones]]This charger is fast without overheating. It hold tight in the cigarette lighter. very well designed and reasonable priced. Highly recommended.This is the second Anker product i got.
0525952926|5.0|I first read Follett's The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End and HIGHLY recommend those. The I read the first book in the Century Trilogy, Fall of Giants and couldn't wait to read Winter of the World. All these are wonderful! The perfect combination of great characters, awesome storytelling and history. All are MUST reads.
B00A2V2OVK|5.0|Here is the prequel to the movie where you get to meet Khan and what he's all about. All these original episodes are awesome and especially in HD - the clarity is incredible. For those that enjoyed the original series or simply never got a chance to watch it 40 plus years ago - it will be an awesome experience!
193700788X|4.0|Wow, it seems like a lot of people are hating on this book and I'm not sure why. True, there was a lot of loose end getting tied up and, true, the romantic conclusion was visible from the previous book. Also true that a few characters seem to appear just to say goodbye. But, if a reader knew that this is the last book of the series, these things really shouldn't surprise anyone. And you would have to have been living under a rock not to have known that this is the last book in the series.<br /><br />This book is not that different from all the others in that there are people and other creatures trying to kill Sookie, there are friends trying to help Sookie. The plot moves along pretty swiftly. I didn't notice any boring parts. In fact I stayed up late to finish the book.<br /><br />My sneaking suspicion is that most faithful readers are just disappointed that Charlaine Harris decided to end the series and are taking it out on this book. On one hand, I don't blame them, because I'm disappointed with that decision too, but on the other hand it seems unfair. She is the author and it's her series, she can do with it as she pleases. I'm grateful for 13 entertaining books and I include this last one among them.<br /><br />In my opinion, it was entertaining and definitely worth the money, especially for those who have read all the previous books in the series.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family loved this movie. I think my husband liked it the most :) My son, age 4, thought it was pretty funny but my husband was laughing through the whole thing!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another wonderful novel by Lee Child. I don't know where he gets his ideas, but, he is an awesome writer. Get all the Jack Reacher novels.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics in this game are some of the best I've seen so far for a Kindle game. It only lasted about 2 hours but it was well worth the $2 I paid. It's nice to play something that actually makes you think.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Again, any Jack Reacher novel is awesome. This one especially is a nail biter. I am getting close to the end of the Jack Reacher series and I am not looking forward to that. I can't get enough.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is a great CD and exactly what we wanted.  I love the music and it has good memories for me.  It came on time and new in the box.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This book was bought by my daughter, not me. I gave her my first Kindle and am trying to get her to register it in her name so I will not be asked to comment on her purchases. I am not a fan of this story.
0374531269|5.0|This is required reading for Florida pre AP english-freshman. Heavy on the heart. It was new and came on time.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This book was also bought by my daughter not me as soon as she registers the Kindle I gave her the sooner she can comment on the books she got. I am not a fan of this story
B009GX7IRA|4.0|The writing isn't great. But it is good. Keeps you interested. Many twists and turns and unexpected events. Makes for good TV.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book has changed how I relate to myself and others. I like how I feel when I use NVC techniques and this book helped me understand the process.
B00008NRI7|4.0|Cute romantic comedy. Easy to watch. Good for light entertainment. Good acting. Funny spin on social commentary about preserving things that matter.
B006S01GH2|5.0|It's quirky.  Loved it.  I've seen it before and enjoy it each time I watch this lovely, happy, odd film.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|the show had so many good songs that i was hoping would be on the cd and weren't. maybe the next one will be better i hope.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app, now the recent change has me confused. I hate it now, if you cannot go back then I will look for a new app for the weather.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I really think it should be updated the new one has horses donkeys and all sorts of stuff hurry up with the update
0823016714|4.0|We actually bought this to show expressions to my autistic daughter.  We hope she will explore the book more in the future.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|can't read emails from amazon.com font way to small on the Kindle, have to see all the commercials when playing games is an annoyance
B00AAU7AI0|4.0|Motivating read, but a lot of the thoughts appear repetitive from earlier works of the author.  Nevertheless,  Coelho's magic still does the trick
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Amazing I can't believe its free<br />It's really great I love it it's so fast graphics are great just UNBELIEVABLE
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This game is very fun and helps make time pass by fast at work, very pleased with this purchace, definitely considering buying &#34;Hidden Letters&#34; now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game is way cooler then granny run awsome it's way easy to get coins for apps and games this game lets you keep your coins unlike granny run awsome fun game your going to love this game
B0018BZEOC|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  I remember seeing it in the theater and a family (with Children) were sitting in front of me.  I don't know what they were expecting, but the crude humor was too much for them and they quickly love.  This humor is exactly why I fell in love with this movie.
193700788X|1.0|It's like it ended without regard to 12 years of character development. I was very disappointed in the end product.
B0000024JN|5.0|Fantastic album that brings back all those memories of playgrounds, bomboxes and everything else that is the 1980's!  There will never be an album quite like this!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Best in the series. Want to go back and reread every single book to pick up on the clues and side stories about Kaleb. Was not expecting such an intense story and resolution to the Psy conflict. Looking forward to where the series will be going next. Want to see Aden and Vasic's story.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book is just amazing. I saw the movie several years ago and this book is much better (usually they are) than the movie.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|I didn't think it was as bad as the critics made it out to be, but I don't know that I'll watch it again.  I thought Mila Kunis was good up until her transition to the Wicked Witch of the East (or whatever Wicked Witch is in Wizard of Oz).  Flying Monkey's in this one are WAY scarier than the original.  That is enough to keep me from watching it again.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|This program is NOT user friendly. I can't figure out what I am supposed to do, I will stick with Facebook.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This band brings a freshness to traditional values through their music. The harmonies are a simple delight to listen to....WONDERFUL!!!!!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Liked the movie a lot.  Great action scenes.  Good getaway from the stress of real life.  Wife loved Thor ........... said he was a &#34;hunk&#34;.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I enjoyed the way that Marvel Studios melded the characters interpersonal conflicts into the storyline. It made the movie both adventuresome and humorous as well.
B00004T2FQ|5.0|I am not an opera attendee but like many of the songs. Pavarotti and Sutherland are gone, and when they sing, it makes my heart sing also. Particularly like hearing Sutherland. I am not very critical about opera singers because I don't know enough to be critical. Some sing and you just like them singing some song better than the other guy and sometimes the other guy sings some other song better. For what it is worth, I am enjoying this CD and hum along while driving.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|Best Free Radio around for Kindel! I have tried other ones but the graphics and choices on this one are very good.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Too much like temple run. Great graphics though and I love minions but didn't care for the game. I did like the way the game prompted me that my minion was waiting to run.
B000JGQRPC|5.0|What can I say.  Loved it. Saw the movie first and relaized I needed to read it. So worth it.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|So far this is the only bird game myhubby hasn't liked. He does not play friends on anything so maybe that's why.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics of this game is so nice. The horses are beautiful and the game is fun. You get to care for the horse and train it to win competitions. Just wish the presentation stuff was not so costly.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!!!it is super cool polished hu bashing super funny and fun and cool who loves it like if u doo cookbook option have behind Jensen nsn
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game cuz its awesome!!!!!!! \ ) and now I have to fill the minimum so. DERPY IS BEST PONY!!!!!<br />Edited to add that my son is the one who wrote the above review.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is simply a great read.  You will find yourself being one with the game and you will relive it in memory.
B00993I6D2|4.0|Not a great Movie, and seriously fails to do the book justice. But since I love the book so much, I had to watch it.  Wife hasn't read the book yet, so had to explain much of the plot to her, because the movie jumps around and doesn't have enough dialog explaining Winstons thoughts.  So much doublespeak these days, &#34;Affordable Care Act&#34;, &#34;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#34;, &#34;Rewarding Americans for Work&#34;.  It's all doubleplusungood in my book.  Need a remake with Hilary Clinton as the head of the &#34;Ministry of Truth&#34;, Biden as the head of the &#34;Ministry of Love&#34;, and of course Big O as Big Brother.  Great book, warning, story, poor movie.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|You have to pay money for &quot;cute coins&quot; in order to get more workers, which stinks because for this game,it gets challenging without more workers. Plus, the graphics STINK!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A classic Shakespearean trajedy wrapped around a spy thriller. A must read for every Steven King fan. Puts every conspiracy theorist to shame.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love the way this book finished a great series, I would recommend this series to anyone who love a story the has a kind of mid evil setting with a technical history that is work into a great adventure.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Really wanted to like this. But as in way too many corporate(Hollywood) films today, the story is too predictable, the dialogue is generic, and I found the characters for the most part absolutely uninteresting (the monkey sidekick is a little appealing). Mostly this was a sad experience for me. This is disservice to art and to the artists involved. This is what can happen when you take great talent and squeeze it through the corporate homogenization machine. It is painfully obvious that for example, Sam Raimi, is being restrained at most every turn here. The distinct unique spirit and expansive imagination of his early Evil Dead films is only glimpsed occasionally, usually briefly, leaving one with the feeling he had to sneak it in. And Rachel Weisz seems particularly wasted. Compare the lifeless flat character she plays here to the endearing vivid relief into which she modeled her Mummy heroine(yes, sometimes good artful movies slip through the corporate grinder). Please fill these boardrooms with more artists rather than MBAs before I give up on Hollywood for good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game seed makes you think about what to do next. It's great from memorization as well for you have  to memorize the colors ans patterns<br />that you need for the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game that the kids and I can both enjoy playing together. I would recommend it for everyone
0525953728|4.0|Mark Owen is a pseudonym of former member of the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare Development Group [Seal Team Six]. No Easy Day is similar to the oral history work of Studs Turkel, a Chicago newspaper feature writer and bestselling author.. Kevin Maurer, an embedded writer with U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan, is the co-author of the book.  Owen describes his career and several of his Seal Team Six mission.  The mission that killed Osama Bin Laden is described in the latter half of the book, which was written and published without clearance from the Department of Defense. After the September 2012, the identity of the author was revealed to be Matt Bissonnette and the Department of Defense confirmed this.<br /><br />Bissonette describes his early in Alaska, his long desire to be a SEAL and  the rigors of  his admission to Seal Team Six. His work in  several operations, including the Maersk Alabma hijacking rescue, is described as well as the camaraderie, professionalism, and dedication of the team's members. Owen's participation in the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden is offered from a boots-on-the-ground perspective and is quite similar to the film Zero Dark Thirty.  Furthermore the emotions, sights, smell and tremors of the events are delivered with a brisk and compelling narrative style.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I'm using this to connect to my gigabit Ethernet on my MBP and it is awesome. Once I upgraded all parts of my network to GigE, I can move huge amounts of data around very easily. My only gripe was I had to DL drivers from Anker's website, but I'm not sure if its Apple or them I should give a hard time to about this.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is fun and engaging. It gets you involved with caring for, training, and competing in  horse competitions. This app also lets you be a horse owner without going to the stable.
B003A9WLCS|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECORD. I HOPE ALL ARTISTS ARE LIKE SADE, W CONSISTENT WORKS
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Pretty disgusting actually.  I saw no humor in it. Do not waste your time and money on this video. Sucks
B00594XOZU|5.0|The people who gave bad reviews, saying that there is no way to block, or there is no way to send videos or audio is lying. This app has everything, and you can see when someone is about to text you back. 5 Star quality.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I gave this book to my friend, to inform the education of her little girl as she grows up. I wish we all had a healthy dose of caitlin in us.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Firstly I must say that I am a fan of the book series and must say the books are better than the show but the show is still amazing. So full of drama and action. And this DVD set is well put together with 2 episodes per disk and a very well done fold out holder. If you love action, drama, intrigue and even a bit of nudity (its on HBO) then this is certainly the show for you.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had to really push myself through the beginning of this book. It got good, although crazy in part 2. And the end totally felt like the writer gave up & just stopped writing. I was really disappointed by the ending.
B000W93CHC|5.0|What a fantastically written book!  Loved the storyline and was on the edge of my seat all the time. I am looking forward to the next story.
B0055S348W|5.0|I printed a few pictures from my Samsung Gal Tab 2 and they all came out fine.<br />The options allow for orientation and a bunch of other options.<br />Works well, worth a try<br />Recommended!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a great little drawing program. I use it to make awesome Wall paper. Great job devs! Keep up the good work!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Intriguing and realistic. I wonder how far all these treats are taken seriously. No more online banking! Praise to the author.
B00APAS1MY|5.0|This book discusses the real important things in life, the simplicity of following intuition, loving and giving to others.  Mantras to live by.
1416550550|5.0|Well written, fun, interesting characters and plot line, this was actually a 2nd copy purchased as a gift. Would recommend to anyone who likes a really good with lots of interesting twists and turns.
B007SXB498|1.0|Don't make the same mistake I did -- I bought this book (which can be downloaded for free on another site) without seeing the sample.  It is not properly indexed for the kindle. The Table of Contents sqishes all the chapters together in one block. The book doesn't use the kindle page turner, you have to \\"scroll down\\" which is not that easy on a kindle.  There is another kindle edition of \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" which I got a sample of first and which I would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for all the family a good variety of runs...plus it's free so why not downloading it! I really enjoy it
1598595474|5.0|The quality of the recordings is great. The message within the book is easy to understand and applicable.  Very clear presentation of the book.  I would definitely buy another audiobook from Oasis Audio.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Just like in the movies... just wished i had a bigger TV. I'm using an active 3D glasses so do not know have the passive ones will look like but with the active glasses, the 3D projections (really projected out from your screen... no joke) are in HD. Awesome!
B001H1UQZU|4.0|Very stellar and moving performance by Hillary Swank and a gut wrenching ending that had me in tears.A must see
B005FRF6PC|5.0|An inside look at Rafa's life. More candid than expected....a good read for tennis fans and others alike. He's extremely hard-working and appears to be as humble and kind as everyone says he is. Fun to read about the day-to-day in the life of a professional tennis player.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I've always been a Die Hard fan and I personaly think this is a good addition to the series, I've watched both versions on this blu-ray and both have there pros and cons (and don't worry those who haven't seen it I won't give out any spoilers) so to those that haven't seen it I'd say if your a fan it's a good addition to your collection.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Perfect attractive duo for this movie, the plot is smart, sensitive, funny, and entertaining. I wish I could see more like those.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|LinkedIn is a great app for networking with business professionals. I like the kindle version of the app. No bugs or crashes, able to update profie, etc. without issue.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Purchased this recently because a friend recommended it. Turned out, i liked it as well! The setting was beautiful and the story is very different in a good way compared to recent movies. Highly recommend it!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Harry Bosch novels are excellent reads - I highly recommend reading if you enjoy a good mystery with some romance/novel elements. Connelly does a great job of developing characters and creating storylines that are engaging to the reader.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Fall in love with Jack in a heartbeat. So many funny one liners. Happy it is not filled with Big named stars.
B0043RSJ8G|2.0|This book was not my favorite Picoult novel. I thought it was lacking in plot and the characters were not well developed. Of all of Jodi's novels, this book was pretty low on my list. Typically, I read her books within a day from start to finish, and I was struggling with finishing this one.
0757302661|4.0|I am currently pregnant with my first child and am looking forward to a natural child birth; this book gives excellent guidance on the natural process. Informative and easy to read. Highly recommended.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Lincoln Lawyer novels are excellent reads - I highly recommend reading if you enjoy a good mystery with some romance/novel elements. Connelly does a great job of developing characters and creating storylines that are engaging to the reader.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome best game out there that I've seen found newsy. Well worth a the money I paid for it. Can't wait for the next o e  foo com we out
B00B10ENBA|5.0|I purchased this movie and downloaded it to my kindle so I could watch it on a long flight. I loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun. It has great graphics, and it is mostly based on the movies. I strongly suggest you try it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I enjoyed this story and found myself engrossed in where the story was heading. I would read more from this author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will challenge and entertain the player. Time will fly by as you get absorbed into the curious ways to &quot;escape.&quot; I really enjoy it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I completely enjoyed the Millennium Trilogy - I could not put the books down and read all three back to back over a weekend. Great story lines and character development that I couldn't tear myself away from. I highly recommend these books if you enjoy a thrilling read with some romance and characters that are robust!
B003PIS5XI|1.0|I love this movie, but the unbox won't run on Windows 8 and now I have spent money on something that I can't use.<br />This isn't how I thought it would happen. I am dissappointed to say the least.
B007SGM084|4.0|I enjoyed these books - this was, to me, just &#34;fun&#34; reading. I got a little bored with some of the sex scenes because it was fairly repetitive. I didn't love the characters because they didn't necessarily portray people that I can relate to, but that didn't mean that reading about them wasn't interesting. I still liked the &#34;love story&#34; aspect and I love to read, so anything that keeps my interest is worthwhile to me. I think the idea of a woman that puts her whole self into a relationship, even if that means changing, is fairly common. I don't know if Gray would've actually been able to just 'turn off' himself in order to accomodate her, though. That seems like it would've been a deeply rooted personality thing more than just something that's easily discarded. Either way, I enjoyed the trilogy because it made me think about people and relationships on a different level than my own!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|These books are wonderful, page-turning fun. I enjoyed the character development and found each to be enriching to get to know. The story lines were weaved together very well. These books were gritty and thought provoking. Definitely on my list of favorites.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I completely enjoyed the Millennium Trilogy - I could not put the books down and read all three back to back over a weekend. Great story lines and character development that I couldn't tear myself away from. I highly recommend these books if you enjoy a thrilling read with some romance and characters that are robust!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is not to hard but not to easy! This game was addicting but I hope they make more levels!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I completely enjoyed the Millennium Trilogy - I could not put the books down and read all three back to back over a weekend. Great story lines and character development that I couldn't tear myself away from. I highly recommend these books if you enjoy a thrilling read with some romance and characters that are robust!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My son and I enjoyed competing with each other to see who could complete a level the fastest. Good app for the whole family.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Puzzles were not readily apparent, but not super difficult. Looking forward to more levels. Have fun!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to read the third book.  I'm hooked on word for word.  I hope the movie does justice to this great story.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love that I never know what to expect unlike most television shows out there. Very intriguing and with a great cast.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have found nothing bad about this app up to this date, I absolutely love this game and I think it is a lot of fun, I would recommend it to anyone and I think you should get it, add me:dukeyjr
B005PK57IK|5.0|I cannot get enough of this series. I had to immediately buy the next season because I was so hooked, and did not want to wait.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|just love this kind of movie it take's me to a whole other place for an 2 to 3 hours.
0811879542|5.0|Very cute book that a big range of kids can enjoy.  There's not much story, so the novelty wears off after several readings, but is a great book to have in the collection!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Lord of Rings movies,I have watch them three times each I also saw the Hobbit and understand a new one is coming out  Can't wait!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This show is a great one to relax to. Not too intense, yet it always has a mystery to solve, a little romance involved, a little intrigue, along with the occational murder or accidental death. Sometimes predictable, but that's ok. Like I said, its nice to relax to.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the story line the dresses the women wear.all the twist and turn .From the time it's starts to the time it  end, I don't want to lose one second of it. I hated that I must wait for the next installment of the story
B003G4W49C|5.0|I need a late pass on this one since I just learned of this book last month, but I'm so glad I finally read this! It's an awesome tale of a gruesome coming of age for a young boy who has the world on his shoulders. Highly recommend this.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|It did not hold my attention did not like  the way it was up dated ,did not like that f bombs were drop.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Taking up where Ender's Game left off, this novel is very much Sci-Fi, but even more philosophical than most philosophy writers. Which I think is a good thing. Great read. Wonderful way to start some conversations in your head about life and existence.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This game is great and has excellent graphics. The beginning levels are big simple, but it gets harder as you progress. It's not earthshatteringly difficult or amazing, but still great for the price. A great game for the airport.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|QR selftitled is not a masterpiece but almost, it's an excellent album. That dual guitars and that bass tone, the precise drums and the correct interpretation and range of Todd brings back the Queensryche we all love!, the classic sound has returned. Oh, how i've missed this band.<br /><br />Lots of hightlights being SPORE my favourite 'till now, other killer cuts are Where Dreams Go To DIe, In This Light, Open Road and the fastest ones: Fall Out and Vindication. Actually  there are no fillers here. (X2 and Midnight Lullabye and kind of introductions to the next songs) The shortness of the album is not a problem at all, you can listen to it over and over and never gets bored.<br /><br />This cd is a victory, a return to form, a well choosed path, the right direction, Queensryche is back!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I really love this game it's awesome and addicting I couldn't stop playing it that I passed all of it! I even bought the expansions and<br />future expansions that's how much I love it<br /><br />People who gave this app a low rating there is nothing wrong with this app it is amazing and on my kindle fire I works like a charm but people have different opinions and devices right?<br /><br />I recommend this app to you by heart and soul it's the best app I have!!!!! :) HAVE FUN !!!! :D
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|It's a fun silly little time waster. It really is a challenge, but in a good way. I am going to keep trying! :)
B008XK69S6|5.0|A refined, fluid, easy-to-use, nearly fully-loaded music player.<br /><br />Reasons you won't try it:<br /><br />- full version is not free<br /><br />- doesn't have all the things even though it has all the features you WILL use and the other stuff is just bloat but that doesn't matter<br /><br />- your shallow, predictable outlook of what apps you already own/use won't allow your brain to retrain on another, superior app<br /><br />- you don't know about it and your internal ignorance/fear system will trigger because taking a risk is American, but that country and it's men are lost so there's no motivation, just like trying to rescue your country<br /><br />Reasons you should try it:<br /><br />- define your own life, create your own destiny, don't listen to a superior review<br /><br />- routine behaviour is healthy, but can distort variety (the spice of life) and trying something new excites and improves mental cognitive function<br /><br />- it downloads album art automatically to organize your lists better (even some obscure, rare Japanese video game's OST cover was found)<br /><br />- only a few other music players have actually improved the sound quality, like Neutron Player, this app is one of those few
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I've always loved Soilwork's tunes, old and new, and when I found out they were producing another album, I was stoked. Couldn't wait. I knew I could expect awesome Soilwork tunes, but this album..This album, is just spectacular. It not only surpassed my expectations, it completely obliterated anything I had in mind. Had no idea such amazing music could be written, and, as always, the keyboards fit right in. Instruments and vocals are phenomonal; Speed has one of the best voices in my opinion, awesome vocal range. Every song is a masterpiece. The Living Infinite sounds like a mix between the old and new Soilwork; heavy and emotional, with out of this world melodies and choruses, and solos to show that Swedes know how to rock. Definitely some of the best music to come out of Sweden, and the best album I've listened to, to date. Biased? Sure. This album flat out rocks.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|classic movie hard to believe how much bikers and hippies were disliked in 1969.  The ending was very very sad
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you're a fan of Gaiman, you can't go wrong in reading this latest novel of his. I would leave a longer comment but feel the sudden and uncontrollable need to fall into another Gaiman book as soon as possible.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a show!  If you have not seen Walking Dead you need to start at season 1 and go from there.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is free though if you ignore that. Still great fun to play. I really enjoyed it. Need more words for review.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I came across this app and installed it (easily) on both my Kindle Fire HD and my Motorola RAZR phone.  In both cases, it immediately found my HP C5100 series printer, printed the indicated docs and let me know when printing was done.  I printed a pdf file, a photo and a web page and all were perfect. Highly recommended.
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|I recently bought this CD for a friend who had lost her previous copy of this item.  I do like K.D. Lang, but do not personally own this CD. All I have to go on was my friends take on the music. It turns out that this item was not the same CD  as the one I was replacing, but my friend had this to say about it:  &#34;This is even better than the CD I lost. Thank you!!&#34;<br /><br />I'm assuming I did good.
B0093QJY0Y|5.0|Before Orson Wells became a bloated wine pitchman, he was one of the greatest actors of<br /> the twentieth century. Not only that he was a creative genius who as a writer, producer and director could assemble entourage casts of amazing quality. Like a perfect storm, all of that talent came together to give the world Citizen Kane, a story of the life of William Randolph Hearst so thinly disguised that Hearst spent a fortune trying to suppress the film.<br /><br />Hearst's aversion to the mirror notwithstanding Citizen Kane is a complex account of a complex man. This restored edition is not just a tribute to Wells and his assembled cast and crew, but to the power of American film at its best.The ironic truth is  that Wells's own descent into self-parody is forecast by the life of Kane. History will see that he and Wells were birds of a feather. That is not an altogether bad thing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun free way to pass the time. I was looking for a hidden object game but I'm glad I found this instead. It makes me use my brain and doesn't offer hints or anything so I can't just click on a button to reveal the answer, I do enjoy not having that cop out. Who knew? Lol.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the second time I have watched Emma. What a classic! It will be in my never-get-tired-of-watching category of shows, which also include Pride & Prejudice, Downton Abbey, Call the Midwife, Upstairs Downstairs, Masterpiece everything.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This book stirs up intense feelings and it never lets up.  This life is so far removed from ours that it's hard to fathom.  I kept wanting to scream at these people to DO SOMETHING....
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I admit I find a lot of his tunes catch too, but she's the one this was purchased for and she's very happy with it.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I love movies like this. Science fiction is my kind of adventure. I have been an avid reader, movie goer and buyer of DVD's for a long time.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Needless to say but I will anyway, this is a movie well worth watching. The quality of the transmission was excellent.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The graphics are incredibly rich, the sounds are great, and you can style the customer's hair however you want! The price tag of $2.99 is a bit pricey, considering you only get 6 customers. When I played the game for the first time, I was expecting at least 12 customers! Other than that, this game was a slam-dunk for me. It is a great time killer in the car. Overall, this is a moderately priced hair studio, that makes you feel like you're working at your own hair salon! I rate this app 4.5 stars.
B006GLT7P6|4.0|I enjoyed this film but not as much as the first movie - the whole nine yards. But, I did like it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the minions in despicable me 2 the movie. I had to get this game when I found it. It is hilarious and you have to down load it. It is so cool and fun to play. Get it today!! :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Not my normal type of reading but that's what I liked. I felt like I walked the PCT with Cheryl. Get past how self-absorbed the author can be at times and enjoy the bigger meaning of this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed working through the puzzles on each level. The learning curve was just right and my daughter had a lot of fun helping out.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I love this and think Rachel is very talented and I appreciate the way the dvd is laid out to for practicing.<br /><br />Beautiful routines.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|was great and very good movie thank you so much<br />have had just a couple of movies that the quality was a problem<br />but this one great  leonard
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I am the world's worst at waiting; this app really helps while away time while I have to wait. It is entertaining, but easy to stop in the middle when my wait is over.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I will remove/repost the well deserved 5 star for the game its self when its fixed or my account is refunded..  You've descided to make a special app for kindle &amp; 900+ people have invested into it now. If were constantly deprived of key in-game content and constantly struggling with glitches what's the point?
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This series is excellent a shame the network never gave it a shot. Great humor and action. Cult classic! I highly recommend!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Any time I downloaded a song(blured lines) it put it on my mp 3 but it didn't let me listen to it.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I enjoy getting the news, especially the world and political news. This app has some issues. It crashes, and many of the pictures won't load.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love this app just for being creative and seeing what the different effects are by changing settings. Great for idle time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really awesome. I like that you are able to see in a percentage the amount of battery usage left.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great app to keep track of work hours and lunch breaks. It has good labels to keep track of different timers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If You haven't seen it watch it from the beginning and you will be hooked in no time.  Its worth taking a look.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The twitter app is increduble. Fast and easy to use. very iser friendly. if u like using twitter on the go get this app. No issues at all.
1452113432|5.0|I love this book. I especially like the nice choice of recipes. Very colorful, lots of pictures, great recipes! I can't wait to try more!
0553593544|5.0|My first encounter with J.Bourne was more than 20 years ago, when I saw the movie with R.Chamberlain, and I was fascinated with the premise and the outcome. When M.Damon reappeared in the same role, I was reluctant to compare the remake with the original film, but then decided to give it a chance, too. All in all, I have become a great fan of the guy deprived of memories, who had to fight them back in unfavorable circumstances.<br />But now I returned to his adventures in the written form, in hopes to draw some inspiration and details for Intelligence operations for my sequel, which is a spyfi. And indeed, I found some strings to pull at for my own book. For which I am grateful to the late Robert Ludlum (:<br />Some people argue the movie is better than the book, but to my mind, they're so different that there could be no comparison between the two. The book is like another parallel story, stemming from the bank's point of divergence, but more thorough, more layered, deeper.<br />If you seek the word-for-word representation of the movie, you won't find it here, otherwise, you'll enjoy it greatly if you like such kind of literature.
B00BSBX9TE|5.0|This is a favourite of mine having read this book numerous times. Very much a chick book which is enjoyable
B008XG1X18|5.0|I AM NEW AND LEARNING HOW TO USE BY TRIAL AND ERROR hope to keep having enjoyment using Pintrist thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got this book for my 5th grader she read the first book in 3 weeks and read this one in the same amount of time, as soon as she was done she got the 3rd book and is enjoying it as much as the first two.  My daughter insists that I read and that they are fantastic books.
B008J5G228|5.0|These shoes are both extremely comfortable and very good looking.  From the first time I put them on my feet felt great with not a single issue with uncomfortable edges or bumps.  Very smooth inside arch and the material was perfect on the feet.  I got great air flow as well so I didn't sweat inside them.  The ONLY issue is that Keen says the HT's are a 1/2 size small and these are accurate, but that is totally wrong.  I tried them on in a local store first and the HT's were at least 1 size too small and the regular Newports were 1/2 to 1 size small.  I ended up getting the 10's even though I usually wear 9's or 9.5 (for narrow shoes).  The 10's fit perfectly.  I tried on 10's in the Newport HT and they seemed ok but a little tight.  Hard to believe it but I think if I had purchased the HT's I would have needed a 10.5!!  I like the leather material (or whatever it is) of the Newports instead of the nylon HT's.  Overall great shoes!!
B00AEFYX4U|2.0|This movie is so funny, I'm a 30 y/o woman and I love it. It's great for the whole family. Johnny Depp did such a great job in this movie!!!!!!!<br />So, why only 2 *'s because mine only came with the blue ray when it was suppose to have a dvd and blue ray, it was also opened and used, when it was suppose to be new, I paid $14.99 for it, with it used and only the blue ray, it was suppose to only be $8.00, but $14.99????? Are u kidding me??!?!?! It's $14.99 at Target brand new with the DVD and Blue Ray, although I don't need the dvd but for that price it should've been new and came with both.  Also my packing for it which came from AMAZON itself sucked bad!!!! The box was entirely too big, I had other stuff in it but everything was sliding around in it because it was entirely too big. My blue ray was loose in the case so scratches were on it, not sure if they were already there or it was because of the packaging.<br />Long story short, either go to Target or expect a problem. I sent in a packaging complaint so hopefully that will help and no one will have problems in the future.....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very easy to use...app is fast...works on my tablet (cheap Polaroid). No issues up to this point, although the book I ordered is relatively small.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just love how this app is set up. It is very easy to read. It is very accurate with the local temps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't play this game...got it for the kids.  They love it.  So far, no technical issues on my Android tablet (cheap Polaroid)...that's always good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My granddaughter got me hooked on this game. It is a lot of fun. Easy to play and keeps my mind active.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I use this to move files around...it works just fine.  I find it a little hard to navigate thru (like many, familiar with windows standards).  I don't use it enough to have too much of a strong opinion.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season you get to really see how far human nature will take you when facing extremely tough situations! The characters really step up and break society standards.
B000957O82|5.0|All the performances are very good, particularly Kevin James, who comes across as more real than anyone else in this flick.  It's a good story and the pacing is lively. A great movie for watching at home!
B000OV85AW|5.0|This was an awesome movie, I highly recommend it. We watch a lot of movies and rarely see one this good.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Everything about this movie made me laugh, from Will's jazz flute performance to the news team rumbles (with some great cameos) to Steve Carrell cuddling with a grizzly bear!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love the multiple storage compartments in the bag. It holds all my equipment securely. The only drawback for me is that it is a little on the bulky side. Outside of that, the bag is a good purchase for the price.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A lot of fun. Nathan Fillion is great in this role.  Wish they could have made more episodes. The rest of the cast does a great job too.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|We saw it originally in the theatre and loved it. Then I put it on my wish list and it became available. I got it for my husband<br />who enjoyed it so and we watched it again with friends and family and even the nefews loved it! Fun, deep and a great watch.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The game looks great and the controls, while generic, are fine. My problem is that it's not a story based game.<br /><br />It's the kind of game where you play the same areas over and over again for points. You get points by destroying enemies, going long distances, and collecting stark tokens. You use said tokens to buy numerous variations of armour which you can use in game.<br /><br />It's very boring and tedious. So incredibly boring that I stopped playing after 20 minutes. I would not recommend this app.<br /><br />Also I not only had to download the app but also the 600+ Mb update I had to download as well, Which took another 10 minutes to do so. Very annoying in my opinion.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Watched them all.  Great show.  Every Season gets better.<br />It'll be sad when the series ends.  I'll watch this series over and over again.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|While Rovio got the Star Wars feel down to a science, No flaw in that aspect of the game what so ever. However, It was frustratingly difficult to 3 star. I have played Angry Birds a lot (the original, seasons, Rio) and I was rather angry and frustrated that I couldn't get a 3 star on the second level of the game despite nearly 20 attempts to do so. I had to use a power up in order to get it. Sort of takes all the fun out of the game.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|Interesting twist and great way to end to Movie Series.  Worth the watch and good for the whole family. Recommend it.
B007N85POS|3.0|Despite being in &#34;HD&#34;, It looks exactly the same as it did when I played it on my 2nd generation iPod touch all those years ago. Would have been nice to see a true graphics upgrade to it.
0316017930|1.0|Gladwell points out some very important factors to increase productivity as a laborer and to be more competitive in an economy that favors employers: Education, Hard Work, Funding, Connections and a little luck.  These are especially important in a declining economy, but their importance is attenuated in a growing economy. As demand for laborers exceeds the labor supply, opportunity is created for everyone, not just the most productive and competitive.  This is the fundamental point that Gladwell does not understand.  He never asks the important questions:  What is causing the demand for labor to decrease?  What is causing a reduction in the supply of jobs?  What is causing economic decline? Why don't we change what is causing demand for labor to decrease instead of increasing the labor supply?  And this is my \\"genuine misgiving\\" with Gladwell's \\"glorious misconception.\\" Still, the reality is that the economy is in decline and laborers will have to become more competitive in order to gain the diminishing number of jobs available in the market. I think Gladwell does a good job providing psycho-analytical reasons for accepting and persisting in the grind of life as it becomes more grueling and for accepting failure as the result of bad luck. More capital consumption in order to grow and make more competitive the labor supply is not a long term solution.  Increasing the labor pool does not equate to increasing the job pool.  It is not opportunity in real terms.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I really enjoy<br /> this game. Would actually enjoy it more if it was not for the annoying ads. Oh well such is life these days.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy this app. I have been playing it on my iPhone for a few years now so I was really excited when I saw this was available here but when ever I play the display is always upside down is anyone else having this issue
B004SRNH10|5.0|can't say anything bad about Adobe it's reputation stands for itself ,and it's always reliable program and I have used it over 10 years off and on
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really liked this book, not only because it had a great story line, but because it was  historicallycorrect.  I like to read a good story that has some historical relevance.  I did not realize that there actually was an &#34;Orphan Train&#34;, and that there were so many stories connected with the children that were shuttled across country to supposedly find new homes with families that wanted them.  What most of them (the children) got was a life of very hard work and little family interaction.  They were a &#34;free work force&#34; for many of the new parents (guardians) and little love was shown.  The interaction of the two main characters with an age difference of 7 decades goes to show that life experience knows no age divide.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a &#34;good read&#34;.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Easy to use with lots of clipart and other fun things just an around great app.  Thanks, for this free app.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Avast mobile security warned that the app contained a virus and wanted to remove it which I did immediately. Be warned.
B003UESJHO|4.0|This is a great movie overall and especially people who hail from Boston would wicked enjoy it! Happy viewing! Satisfied!
B008OOYALE|1.0|I downloaded this because I have played a lot of games by this developer. The game itself is fun but I closed the game and went back to it and my history was completely erased. I wish that I could have continued to play this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book!!!!! I really liked it considering I didn't think I would. It took a while for me to get past a party, but as soon as I did I couldn't put it down.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Love story from beginning to end.  Beautiful scenery !  One of those movies that leave you feeling good about mankind.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so addicting time flies with this game. And it is so easy to get upgrades with no real money!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book started out strong unil Hosseini moved away from the initial characters and started involving new less interesting characters.  Ultimately, he did bring all the characters together; however, it really didn't work.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|If you are not a Blade Runner person or looking for a gift of a Blade Runner person, I do not know why you would want this item.<br />How many versions of one film could you want?<br />The studio played with the 1982 US Theatrical Version editing the story and creating a \\"happy ending\\".<br />To complicate things, 1982 International Version, US cable and video version made a number of changes to the Theatrical Version.  This was very much the \\"official version\\" for many years.<br />The 1992 Director's Cut changed the film.  Much of the narration is gone, as is the \\"happy ending\\".  This film suggests a darker future and raises questions about the hero's humanity.  This was the preferred version.<br />RIDLEY SCOTT'S ALL-NEW \\"FINAL CUT\\" VERSION OF THE FILM is a completely re-master version with additional and extended scenes among other things.<br />There is a feast of specials included that will keep a fan busy for hours.<br />This is in addition to the better picture that Blu-ray provides.<br />This is packaged in an attractive \\"book\\" style case with photos and sketches.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. Had fun looking for all the stuff on each floor. Would like to continue with more floors.
B000JCQCW4|2.0|Addiction is a game the whole family can play. Mom gets addicted to diet pills, son addicted to heroin, girlfriend trades straight & lesbian sex for her supply.  No happy ending for any of the main characters.
1616615362|5.0|The Firespray is everything you want in a large ship. It manuevers as well as an X-Wing, hits as hard, is much tougher, and has a rear fireing arc. Three Bounty Hunters equals 99pts, and is a fantastic entry squadron for tourny play.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this whole series!!!!! Not for the weak of heart but you get used to the gore because of the great story line!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book. You just never knew which direction this book was going to go. Grisham always keeps you guessing. A real page turner.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Unreal. Not so much a book as it is a look into the true heroes this country has protecting our freedoms. I felt like I was there watching it all play out--The mark of great writing and a great story. If I didn't already know how understated and insubstantial a movie would be, I would think this is the kind of story the big screen was invented for.
B00CW665VI|1.0|this book was too racey for me . I read about half of the first chapter and deleted it from my kindle
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very creative love the baby animals. Can build some elaborate houses. More animals would be nice. Keeps my kids busy.
B00571F26Y|3.0|just an average diet book, but informative. I may continue to read it but was not all that iteresting to me
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Initially I liked the weather channel and say it as a very useful app. The issue I have to give it three stars is every time it is updated it becomes less user friendly. The information is much harder to mine out, the way it is set up which frustrated me.
B00006D295|5.0|this is my every Halloween movie, I invite a crowd to watch it with me, we all know the music and all of the actions. plus the timewarp!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Love this movie!  Great humor and great story!  Good for the entire family.  This is one I'd recommend to anyone.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|this is a fun movie and really hard to find else where  one of my families all time favorite halloween shows
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Definitley the best album from them to date! A passionate playlist filled with star studded guest artists, the theme of Fire is often recurring throughout. For fans old and new. Each song is full of feeling and gusto. Somehow, the variety of musicians marries perfectly.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|diff screens are sometimes harrd for my eyes to adjust. can get monotinous.  Leaving mandatory review so I came play sneak peek of Jewel Legends 2
B002Q63JEU|4.0|All of the anger and difficult emotion felt by the band before the exit of the Farro brothers, this album is honest and dabbles a bit more in the pop sound. The sound is balanced between the vocalist and the instruments. Fans of Riot! Will enjoy this
B00CISAPJS|4.0|Each member of my family enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  It was a enjoyable story line and had lots of action!
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|A great album, especially for a self title. It embraces everything they went through and who they are as a band right now. A collage of different sounds and of experiences, this is definitely worth getting if you are a fan of the band. My personal favorites are the Interludes, with the more acoustic sound.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I had this item on a former Kindle, which had to be returned as it did not function properly.  Don't know how to get it to my new kindle fire
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes. This series does a wonderful job of translating the old stories into modern times while still keeping the themes of the original stories. The cinematography is excellent, the characters are deep, and the interplay between the actors is superb. Watson is my favorite character in this series and I like that they've portrayed him as a strong character. It is an excellent series!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loose track of time everytime that I play!<br />I cant wait to get more rooms. if you like to do puzzles then this it for you. I thought I wouldn't like it but I loved it.  its free so there is nothing to loose!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to love this app on my phone and kindle but I hate the new interface and useless achievements. Will be deleting and finding new weather app.
B009R659L8|5.0|wonderfully written but a bit predictable. had it figured out less than have way through. Good read though. still finished it even knowing the end
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Lots of twists, laughed at the witty repartee', had heartbreaking moments, coupled with heartfelt happy moments. Loved Loved Loved this book, and the second, &#34;Losing Hope&#34; - which gives you Sebastian's side (his thoughts and reasoning behind the erratic behavior at times.....)  Just make sure you stick through to the end on that one [the second] because it ties the story up in a neat bow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it - BUT - being new to Amazon I didn't like the fake out.<br />Only 1 episode with membership then if I wanted to see more it was another FIFTEEN BUCKS!<br />That was wrong to do to new member - I never saw in all the advertising about how you charge over and above the annual membership fee.  I feel that's wrong - really wrong - be upfront

034580709X|2.0|I was interested in this book because of the Sydney setting. In that regard it didn't disappoint. There's lots of the atmosphere of the city's neighborhoods and the inclusion of Aboriginal characters with their folk ways.<br /><br />The mystery plot isn't bad, not the most original but it hangs together and makes a kind of sense. A good use of the Aquarium at the end.<br /><br />What I did not like was the character of Harry Hole. The author goes hot and cold. At times there's very detailed explanations of Harry's past and what motivates him (almost too much for a who-done-it kind of book).<br /><br />Then Harry is suddenly doing things with no explanation that makes little sense.<br /><br />Like when Harry in a bar wanders over to pick a fight with 4 or 5 uglies that clearly outmatch him.<br /><br />Like when a Sydney colleague he's known a few days and came to like, dies, Harry not only falls off the wagon, he goes on a drunk that lasts for days and days. He snaps sober suddenly for a bit then goes drunk drunk drunk again.<br /><br />Near the end Harry asks a woman he's met, and fallen for, to be bait to catch the killer but he takes no responsibility to see that she's kept as safe as possible. (They put the \\"wire\\" in her HANDBAG!!!!)<br /><br />I actually had to laugh when, as things go south, Harry bleets \\"We're putting Brigitta's life at risk by trying a stunt like this. Don't you see?\\"<br /><br />(BTW, why do the Aussie cops use a civilian?)<br /><br />After the incident with Brigitta.....\\"I think I loved the girl.\\"......after his gesture, while drunk, in memory of her (I guess), I was done. I skimmed the last 25 pages.<br /><br />I understand there are several more Harry Hole books. Maybe he gets more understandable. I'm not interested in finding out.

B0035XVVDY|5.0|If you're looking for a good movie to watch, this is definitely one of those! Its smart and suspenseful, it keeps you guessing.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This game is very addictive.  The game play is very unique and is a lot of fun.  The graphics are amazing.  My only complaint is that the controls are a little difficult.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A few British travellers, some rather unhappy, are trying the same hotel. The Indians are very earnest about being top notch, the Brits are new, rather doubtful, all with problems to solve but mixing quite well with each other. We see their struggles with making ends meet, rekindling an old love, quarreling, perhaps finding new friends. Many problems of the hotel and its eager young manager mix with keeping the guests happy. Many quandries are answered, the acting is quite true, the feeling we get is somehow peaceful and rewarded.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This is a well done screenplay and good acting. However, a trite too much sociology for my taste. Enjoyable in all.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game I love the Minion they are cute and I like the where they talk and I love the movies too
B00APAENUI|5.0|My only complaint is the lead character spends too much feeling guilty about lives lost, and taken in Wartime. The author tries to accommodate the random, one book reader, and the series reader at the same time. This creates a lot of repetition from book to book. I would put a note in the foreword and a list of the series in order written. If you are trying to decide if you like the books, start a the beginning.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Makes one think about what is really important...what would you take with you?  Read it straight through...could not put it down...the movie did not do it justice...which tells me we really should reflect on our values/lives.

B004SMD4H2|4.0|Love this show and would have given it a 5 star rating but the case was a real pain to get the disks in and out of the box as well as the last disk in this set was a little out of whack with the episodes being out of order. So u have to go out of sequence in order to watch the show as it was supposed to be seen and you don't get confused as to what is going on in the show.  My order showed up on time and not smashed like you might get from some other retailer. Other wise its a fantastic show with two thumbs up.

B009GEYX5E|3.0|I was so excited to buy this film for my Polaroid Sun 600 LMS. The film loaded into the camera well and took pictures I had no problem with that, but all my pictures came out dull and almost sepia coloured. I was expecting them to be colourful and vibrant. It was still fun to take the pictures and wait for them to develop, but I don't think i'd buy this film again. It's too expensive for only 8 shots and the colour didn't even work for me. What a shame.
B005544TRQ|5.0|As stylish as Mad Men but doesn't take itself too seriously. The drama is not gut wrenching and the humor is light-hearted.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|****************SPOILER ALERTS***************<br /><br />I feel I can't write anything better than what has already been written here here but I will give my opinion of what I took away from this movie.<br /><br />This is the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand over the Christmas holiday, 2004. This is an upper class family of five (parents Maria and Henry, and three sons, Lucas, the oldest at around 12, Thomas, next at around 6 or 7, and Simon maybe 4 years old). They are staying at what appears to be a 5 star ocean front resort. On December 26, the day after Christmas, as all five are enjoying themselves at the pool. Maria opts to relax and read a book, while enjoying the antics of her \\"boys.\\"<br /><br />The impossible happens so quickly, nobody has time to gather family members let alone try to get to safety. One minute Maria was standing by a glass wall retrieving some pages of a book which had been caught up in an unexpected strong breeze. As she picks up the pages, she stops, listens and KNOWS something is wrong. As the waves cascaded over the front of the resort and finally hit the pool area, all she could do was scream for her husband and children before being picked up and swept crashing through the window, through every kind of manmade and natural pieces of things smashed by the water.<br /><br />This is probably every person's nightmare. What I would like to try to convey to you that touched me so deeply in this movie was, first of all the realism that at times was excruciating to watch. I had thought that Maria would have been at the heart and soul of this tragic event replayed for us to see what mayhem can lay around the corner for any of us. But it was Thomas whose story became central as he found his mother in the initial incoming mess and literally saved her life. This young boy was exposed to a terrifying event at such a young age and proved to be a leader, a caretaker, a sleuth and ultimately the tie that pulled the family back together in the midst of chaos.<br /><br />I have read much about that tsunami, and judging by the fact that the water at their resort became shallow quickly, they were at the edge of this catastrophe. Even so, this movie made far more real, to me, the events as they took place over the next 24 hours. Yes, some scenes were difficult to watch and I cried a lot throughout it. But at the very heart of this movie, as this well off family is reduced to the level of the poorest native, was the intense kindness conveyed by many who made this same journey (not all were kind, though, and happily, Maria Belon, who takes story credit, chose not to dwell on the negative, but to let the shining light of who we can be to each other as humans, experiencing a horrific event at the same time).<br /><br />I am glad I watched this movie. Happy to see there is yet hope for humanity despite the things going on around us today. There were no heroes, no take charge fixer, just a lot of people trying to stay alive and find their loved ones. Let me take that back. There were many, many heroes that day, but today we will never know their names. I have one quibble with the movie which I have debated whether to drop a star or not. At the very end, when they were flown to better facilities, they flew in a rather large, empty jet. I was left wondering why, with what looked like tens of thousands of people left in sweltering heat, many with still bleeding injuries, many wearing torn clothing and no shoes. It seemed to me that this family was the type to at least try to see if others needed a lift. Perhaps they did and it didn't fit in the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie if you just want a good look at humanity in chaos and how people behaved. For me, it was uplifting and hopeful. I wish the Belon family long and happy, blessed lives. For it was nothing short of a miracle, it was nearly impossible that they made it out, all five, as an intact family with mostly treatable injuries. This story opened my eyes to the many other catastrophes that seem to be taking place more and more today. It left me wanting to be involved in somehow helping people in each instance. I won't soon forget The Impossible. It left an indelible mark on my heart.y opened my eyes to the many other catastrophes that seem to be taking place more and more today.

B001DCZ4IW|5.0|It's been many years since I saw this movie the first time, but I remember falling off my chair in the theater because I was laughing so hard. I have seen it a couple of times since then and it has aged well.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game that kids really seem to enjoy. It's cute, fun, and everyday is a new adventure in the sea.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Very good and lessons taught in everyday life in families and how we can be apathetic or assertive and tough love!
B008SA21N8|5.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\": Bleary-eyed yet very entertained, I am so pleased to have a show surprise me this much. Seeing the two sleek GQ guys on the promos on TV made me think this was a serious law show narcissus-fest and I didn't even give it a chance...well, some of the characters are narcissistic in parody, among several kinds of parodies. The interplay between the main pair, a shark lawyer with flashes of good humor, Gabriel Macht (Harvey Specter) and his uber-genius sidekick Patrick J. Adams (Mike Ross) is captivating and amusing as they further reveal who they really are as human beings, not just 'suits'. The top star of this show is Rick Hoffman (Louis Litt), in my opinion. Along with his expressive feline green eyes, he is multi-dimensional: brilliant and hysterically funny, rebellious then sycophantic, sincere, cunning, mean and sweet - in random order. The other cast fits perfectly in with the main characters, with intelligent and fresh plot-lines, again, a very happy surprise. The only complaint is the slightly unrealistic runway-ready clothing, hair, etc. of the gorgeous model women lawyers, paralegals and legal secretaries, a little touch of reality in that area would be nice (MAYBE it's the narcissistic parody I mentioned). Their male counterparts are not as 'modelesque' and highly maintained, except for 'Monsieur Parfait' Harvey Specter, of course. I 'judged' a book by its cover and would have missed out if I hadn't read the reviews here!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|It taught some morals along with entertainment for the kids.  The children playing the characters were very good actors for the most part.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|An easy and easy to understand read about a growing trend in the \\"diet\\" world. Dr. Mosley provides wonderful information combined with personal accounts and examples that lend credibility to the FastDiet in numerous ways. There is a wonderful selection of really delicious recipes in the back of the book that can work for anyone looking for healthy and tasteful food options. I purchased the Kindle format and it is just terrific. This book is definitely a permanent addition to my collection. Highly recommend.

B00DPY95D6|5.0|A book with a very curious, interesting, engaging plot.  Starts with a court case but becomes a thriller with stalkings and strange happenings.  Cheryl is the main character, a lawyer, that we are following.  Where are the cars following her and the listening devices coming from?  Could it be the corporation stalking the lawyer that is challenging them in court, because she could cause them great headaches with the lawsuit?  Could it be the boyfriend, who becomes an ex-fiance?  And how does her new boyfriend/fiance fit in, since problems stop when he is around?  Is it the police or government watching, and what's up with her cell phone company?  It seems that everyone is against Cheryl, even the justice system.<br /><br />Our main character, Cheryl, is never sure who is on her side and when she is safe.  Cheryl has to worry about the possibility of an occult being invading her space, and maybe even her.  Is it all in her mind?  The story keeps you at the edge of your seat just reading.  I could barely put the book down.<br /><br />I assume there will be a sequel to this book, since it stops with many questions unanswered that lend themselves to another exciting book.  I will be awaiting the next book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|In a rare and unbelievable twist, season 2 is even better than season 1. So if you liked season 1, you'll like season 2.

Enjoy!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|fabulous acting, staging, directing, writing, sets, this show has it all.  The cast is fabulous.  Nothing disappoints.  And the very ending of season III - omg - what a way to go!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So I caved in and finally spent some cash on a legitimate gaming mouse. Before this I was bouncing between low quality 2 button mice and/or those $1 ones that come with new purchases on iBuyPower. The mouse is a dream in my hand, perfectly comfortable. It also comes with adjustable weighting in the heart of your palm for true customization.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for glowing things, and boy does this mouse glow. Matches my Saitek backlit keyboard as if they were packaged together. You can even change the color and pulse rate of the Anker logo under your palm. Who doesn't want a mouse that can methodically pulse red like an angry HAL 9000?<br /><br />The mouse wheel has a great texture and is crisp to use. There is a button that lets you switch between 4 levels of sensitivity on the fly, which has proven invaluable in online multiplayer games such as Battlefield 3. I'm able to use the lowest setting while sniping, and quickly switch to a higher sensitivity when driving tanks or using other mounted guns (huge advantage).<br /><br />My only minor criticism is the 3 thumb buttons are slightly difficult to get used to, but their shapes and varying depths does allow for gradual acclimation.<br /><br />Overall this is a great mouse at a great price. I didn't want to break the bank on such a basic piece of computer tech, but this is one of the rare purchases of I made in the way of peripherals that I do not regret (looking at you, 10 year old Microsoft Sidewinder Pro II Joystick).
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Gotta start with the first season but its a good show. Worth your time to get into, and free with amazon prime.
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|This is overall an excellent movie. Quality production by Disney. However, I had to take away 2 stars for 2 main reasons:<br /><br />3D special effects are very average. Nothing spectacular here. Seems like this movie was not originally shot in 3D, but was converted into 3D after production. So, save your money and buy the 2D version.<br /><br />Granted this is a &#34;spy&#34; movie, the plot is too complicated for a young kid to understand.
1620404869|5.0|If you are into Jane Austen and a little bit of cheesy romance, this is the book for you. This is a really fun book to read when you are looking for a quick escape from reality. I finished it one day because I couldn't put the book down. I really liked that the author tied in some classic Austen dialog and story elements into the story line as well. I found myself laughing out loud at a few of the references.

I really only play counter strike from time to time and i haven't ran benchmark testing, but it handled Far Cry 3 very nicely.<br /><br />Really though, i honestly dont think the extra ounce of performance on the 660 TI version is worth it.<br /><br />Specs:<br />i7 3770K<br />8gb 1600mhz ram<br />600 PSU<br />One 660 card<br />game mounted on 250gb SSD<br />z77 extreme 4 motherboard<br /><br />If GTA5 comes out for PC next year, i'll look into running SLI bridge on two of these badboys.
B001G50SLE|5.0|I love supernatural! Supernatural is awesome! Admitted this isn't my favorite episode... But still AWESOME.<br /><br />On a side note, I'm not a big fan of amazon video's format, I like iTunes better, but whatever...
B008Y73940|4.0|Very riveting movie on how this lawyer ends up basically being the victim of his very own client and how he still manages to see the man is punished for his crimes even though not convicted of the one that he was defending him on.  Traps him on the others.  GREAT movie!!!
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Who can walk away from the movie not humming the theme music?  Now that it's my alarm clock theme, getting up in the morning just seems a whole lot easier.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very entertaining, watched this with my spouse and we both enjoyed the movie. Perfect for a family movie night. :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun game. Everyone knows it, so buy it, play it, and become addicted like everyone else!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play with. More fun if more difficult. A good app to download anyways. More words more words more words more words more words...
B003SXHZG8|5.0|One of my favorite movies. However the only reason i both this was because I was tired of waiting for a directors cut or specail edition set to come out.
B0064BWDRW|2.0|Have read one of the Harry Hole books before, was really good. But I am a third into this book, and find it very disjointed, no sign of the story coming together.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. I was just so in love with the book so I am not too proud of what facts they changed or didn't put into the movie. I wasn't even aware this movie was out for two years!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Temple run but minion style. Lots of fun. Works great on kindle fire. Great way to past the time. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes these cute little guys.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not too difficult. Definitely have to use your mental abilities. It's exactly the kind of game I love. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for updates.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I decided to read World War Z after the movie came out this summer. The movie fails in comparison to the brilliance of this story. The method the author uses to tell the story of an actual world war was something I had never experienced before and begged for more as I turned the last page. I guarantee I will read this again and again. Highly recommended.
0765324849|5.0|The book comes with a glossy plastic wrap around and looked kind of cheap at first. But I took off the cover and unveiled a well printed, well made book. The actual hardcover has a nice matte emerald/seaweed green color and displays the title, etc. along the spine in a nice golden text. The book is great for anyone who loves the bioshock franchise and it goes more in depth with the beloved underwater city of rapture.
B00006LFGD|3.0|I was not as good as i had anticipated. I like Barbra but do not know what I was expecting
0060007737|5.0|This is a great book. Easy read and there are great examples to go along with their principles. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get started in branding.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging puzzles... the only negative I found with game is the small number of rooms to escape froom. Wish there was more puzzles) to solve.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|This is a truly fabulous movie! I consider it to be a classic film and I recommend it to everyone!
0375703764|5.0|To say that Mark Danielewski's \\"House of Leaves\\" is a novel is both an understatement and a misnomer.  \\"House of Leaves\\" takes traditional conceptions of narrative and style and throws them out the metaphorical window.  The novel is one narrator's account of his experiences following the discovery of a mysterious manuscript, a manuscript that in turn chronicles a terrifying documentary (one that may or many not even exist) - this may sound confusing - and it is, at least initially.  The novel uses different typefaces for its various narrators, and once the reader acclimates to the pace of the novel, it becomes easy to understand its unique style.<br /><br />As the story progresses, the themes of isolation and horror become increasingly prevalent, until even the text itself seems to be at its wit's end - sections of the book are made nearly illegible, with strike-outs and redaction, others have text in staggered orientation across the page to simulate the contraction or expansion of space, while still others read like the ramblings of a madman, massive lists that span several pages, but really have no relevance to the current narration.  These mechanics are masterfully combined to make one of the most compelling and truly scary novels I've ever read - all without resorting to horror tropes like gore and monsters.<br /><br />For the adventurous reader that seeks something new and different from the horror genre and the medium itself, I cannot recommend \\"House of Leaves\\" enough.  It's staggering in its scope and remarkably innovate in its style, and may even change your opinions about what a novel can be.  Just be warned - upon completing \\"House of Leaves,\\" you may never look at your darkened closet the same way again.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This is the a great movie if all you want is a movie to entertain you. Plot is very straightforward and exactly what you expect - non-stop action.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!!! And not to mention it  has MINIONS!!!!!!! BANANAS!!!!!! And UNICORNS!!!!!! So fun! And sort of like temple run but so much better!!!
B00BCX2F66|5.0|There's so few cases on the market for the HTC One. I like that this one is simple, looks nice, and protects it from falls. It's a fairly slim fit, has no problem with a screen protector, and can prop itself for your viewing pleasure on any flat surface.
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|Terrible dialogue, way too much cgi,amateurish acting. A poorly executed high school play would have been more enjoyable.  Too bad since the story was good, they just failed to sell it.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|Kind of has a Brazil or 1981 type mood/setting. Bruce Willis is great. Brad Pitt gets to play a crazy eccentric. All in all a good experience. Worth watching at least once.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|I expected too much from these great actors:  but the script was bad, the plot not well executed but boring.. Iniitially, it was a good idea and what could go wrong with Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman?
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Season 3 felt like the eclipse in the story line for Mary. I was really devastated by the final episode however. Developing into a Shakespeare's tragedy of star-crossed lovers \\"to be or not to be...\\" with a curious twist giving the lovers just enough time together to experience some happiness. What's next for dear Mary?
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is easy enough to play, yet it gives you puzzles that are just hard enough to keep you entertained! I know I'll enjoy this game for a long time.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like the game well, Found it to function great and you get choices as to what shape to play. Well worth the price of free.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I disappeared in this novel, and was teleported directly into my childhood, or what I thought was a childhood memory.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on the $2 deal of the day and can't believe how good it was.  Great concepts and plenty of mystery revealed at a good pace throughout the 5-book series.  Howey creates an amazing future world and take time to develop his characters.  There were many times i stayed up too late because i couldn't put this book down.  I'm picky about my science fiction and am 100% satisfied.<br /><br />I will add that, unlike much of today's science fiction, Wool remains very PG-13.  Other than some language (that is admittedly very in character when used), I wouldn't hesitate recommending this to teenagers (I have no interest in the adult stuff either).  I'm always very impressed when an author can produce excellence without sinking to R or X-rated content (e.g., Ender's Game).  Good on you Howey!
B006QPX7UI|5.0|A little &#34;History Light&#34;, but a very enjoyable film none the less.  Would make a great intro for anyone wanting a general overview.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Very very boring.It copies temple run @ subway suffers no adventure no nothing..I do not recomend this game way to Boring for anyone....:(
1451695195|3.0|This is an unprecedented and inadvertent description of a persistent ICU psychosis, shaped largely by the author's skydiving experience, and characterized by an exquisitely vivid memory of a dissociative state. The author notes that his dissociative state makes his experience distinct from the quintessential near death experience. The vivid memory was probably formed over a few minutes as he emerged from deep unconsciousness to a classic and transient ICU psychosis, which the author recognizes as such. An interesting research question is whether the author's inability to think critically about his dissociative state will abate over time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So fun. Feels mysterious and can't wait to see what happens next. It is challenging but not too frustrating. Definitely recommend!
0736689125|3.0|On the surface, A Time To Kill reminds me a lot of Harper Lee's classic To Kill A Mockingbird.  In both tales, we have an inter-racial rape case that divides the small, southern town in which it was committed, right down the middle.  But where Harper Lee focused more on the crime's impact on the people of the town, John Grisham, as you might expect, delves deeply into the actual court proceedings.<br /><br />Some of the court proceedings are interesting to read about; others, not so much, most notably Grisham's lengthy description of the jury selection process.  A Time To Kill was John Grisham's very first published work, so I can forgive him for that.  Also, I've read some of Grisham's later novels, and I'm happy to report that he got better at describing legal matters without boring us with too many details.<br /><br />By and large, I enjoyed A Time To Kill.  As usual, Grisham's characters are interesting and believable, for the most part.  I can't help but wonder if there really are little towns in the south where this kind of racism still exists.  Scary thought.<br /><br />Alexander Adams did an okay job in his narration of A Time To Kill, but overall I was not impressed with him.  He made up different voices for the characters, which is a good thing in an audiobook, but some of them were a little too melodramatic for an adult audiobook.  Still, he didn't ruin the book for me, as some narrators can do.<br /><br />I always enjoy John Grisham's audiobooks.  This being his first, A Time To Kill is a bit less polished than some of his later work, but it's still worth reading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show.  Cant wait until next season comes out!  Was disappointed with the ending of this season but anxious to see why the writers did what they did
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really loved WOOL.  The first few sections are fast reads and then the story really gets gripping.  The characters are well thought out, and the mystery of the silo and the people in power are continually intriguing.  I'm looking forward to the next series!
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|This movie is timeless, I use to watch it when i was a very little girl. I just ordered it again to watch and get a understanding of it. It was awesome and very funny at points and serious and eye opening.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played so many of these hidden object games I am having a hard time finding ones that keep my attention. This one did! The story line is decent and I have not come across any glitches so far.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is awesome and fun this app is great with children I love this app I also love the movie too
B00CH26TL8|4.0|this game keeps you on your toes you can not just look at the current ball you need to plan ahead. keeps the mind sharp
B00785P2QC|4.0|really fun and addicting game. sometimes gets boring after a while but overall, good game. never disappoints. always play when someone is being annoying or if ur just bored
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game and i personally think that this game is perfect for kid the kids at my house love it ,even I love it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a very interesting and eye opening movie.  I love how the maid got even with the very prejudice white lady.  This movie portrays a very sad part of our history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app and the horses. I would recommend this app for sure. And I have to say I would love it even more if they added the MLP characters. Anyway this app is great and super addictive. Love it!
B002VECM6S|5.0|There is no other way to put it, I love this movie.  Sometimes, we all need someone to just take us under their wing and care about us until we are ready to fly.  A very uplifting movie!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is by far my favorite series ever !! So much action and drama. Can't get enough!!  I was recommended to watch this from a friend a few weeks ago.  I started season 1 and finished all 5 seasons within 3 days.  Loved it !
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is a very fun game to play.  It can be addicting.  I love the noises the animals make and that it is kid friendly and not so violent.  My grandkids love it too, so we play together!
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The character acting was good, but the storyline was week. I don't understand how this got a best pict. nom.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love it its so cool!!!! I would play it everday I would totally tell u to get this app!!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham fans will find this story as refreshing as all his others. The underdog triumphs. Really enjoyed the wrap up at the end.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|at first I downloaded the free version from google play, we fell in love with it so I decided I should buy the premium. the application is wonderful, you can combine sounds to your liking. now we use crickets and river for sleeping and I use the music and other sounds for meditation. there is a problem that the application shuts down when screen turns off but I wrote to ipnos and I am eagerly waiting for their response. the application runs very well but it needs the tablet to be on, and that means the battery runs down faster because the screen is on for longer. I hope they fix that.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|A movie the whole family (mom, dad, and two teenage girls) could watch together and everyone liked it.  Some action/adventure, some comedy, and some cool special effects.
0425263924|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books for a good summer read.  I was about to buy this book thinking it was the grand finale and thank goodness for the reviews.  Although I like the first two books I am not going to invest in FIVE books.  Just not gonna do it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A really cool game. great for horse lover's. its also good for kids! I would recommend it to a lot of people. its great!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am totally enjoying Can You Escape.  It's challenging with nice graphics ..although it's free I don't know how many levels there are but when it's finished I'll more than likely purchase it.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|bought it i liked it so much.  really good movie.  the youngest child is actually funny in an odd way
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Truly an interesting take on a coming of age tale. Like so many others, I found it impossible to put down and read the entire book in one sitting!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It's easy to see why this won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It is definitely not an ordinary run-of-the mill book. It has drama, comedy, and mystery, all presented in an original structure. I read it on Kindle but I appreciated it it so much that I plan to buy the paperback to keep on my shelf for re-reading.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|game was fun and got more challenging as it went on but needs more levels. overall i would give it a 4 star review
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What can I say other than all super hero movies must begin here. This is the bench mark for comic book movies.
B001U1V3RW|5.0|Awesome design and colors. Good value for the money. Cards are of standard weight like regular bicycle brand cards. Different design is eye catching.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book was a really good read. Had me from the beginning and took me all the way to the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute and fun game. Been able to do everything with time. I haven't had to spend any money on the game. Love it
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nick and Amy Dunne are getting ready to celebrate 5 years of wedded bliss when Amy goes missing from their quiet suburban home, with evidence of foul-play leading to a slew of blame, most of it headed Nick's way. We've all seen missing wive stories play out - the cheating husband wants out of the marriage, so he ups her life insurance policy, begins to make insane purchases and lines up his life to move on with a 23 year old mistress. But what we don't see is how many the past can creep up to reveal the best and worst in a couple.<br /><br />Flynn takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride through the Dunne's marriage as you fiendishly try to figure out this \\"Who dunnit?\\" story. What would possess this handsome, charismatic husband to murder his beautiful, rich wife? You'll be shocked when the story unravels all the way through the last sentence of the novel.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars out of 5 because I wasn't too happy with the ending but that's because I hated one of the characters so much and to see them \\"win\\" made me mad. GREAT book!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend, whose dream present it has been since he was a child.<br /><br />No issues whatsoever- everything was intact and as promised.  (The finished product looks great too.)
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Very good entertainment for whole family. From the creators of wallace and gromit, good fun. Would highly recommned for everyone
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's a great game, with plenty of differences between it and the DS version to merit having both.  Lots of fun!!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Even with all the action, it still only hits the high points of the books. There is so much more content to these stories, but this interpretation is awesome!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Who doesn't love task killer, really?  Works perfectly.  Lots of Kindle games keep running after you leave them, so it's an essential for that kind of stuff.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Somehow this movie slipped under my radar. A friend told me about it this summer, and then I saw the commercials for Red 2, and thought I'd better check it out. It was delightful! The writing, acting, and host of stars were terrific! Rent it today, if you want to have fun while watching a movie.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It is a fun game but it froze and i lost most of my seeds (the money for the game)
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Elena Undone has finally made the love between two women so intense on the screen without actually getting too sexual and making it look like a porn.<br /><br />The characters of Elena and Peyton are so well played that they make you feel like this isn't a movie at all but something that is so very deeply true and happening as you are watching it.<br /><br />I think the whole 3.24 min kiss was so well executed that you don't even realize it is lasting that long. It was so deep and everyone wanted it to happen in the movie which made it longed for and when it finally happened it was so intense an emotion that it brings you right into the arms of both women trying to feel the depth of emotion as they must be feeling it at that one long passionate moment of time.<br /><br />The song by Jennifer Corday was well played and made the kiss that little bit more intense and passion filled. The love scenes were very touching and heartfelt yet not done in a way to make it feel cheap or like it was just sex.<br />Overall this film was created with much love and understanding about how two women fall in love and it showed through the film unlike any other I have ever watched.<br /><br />I saw Desert Hearts years ago and I thought nothing could top that. This film has topped it and surpassed it by far.<br /><br />Well done Ladies!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Second seasons often don't compare to the block buster 1st season, but NOT TRUE in this case!  The second season is as power/action packed as the first & keeps you glued to the TV watching.  This mini series is extremely well written & great watching!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|When I open the app now it's like it's trying to be a video game. Please just give me the weather!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is an extremely well written story. I'd heard about it from a friend at work & am HOOKED on this mini series !!!
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Awesome show.  Hope they continue to follow the comic book.  Would like to see a team up with another super hero down the road.
0988262592|5.0|The authors put it all together so well. They show how IT and DevOps are core competencies that underpin an organization's success. If you have competitors, if you sell products or services, if you have employees ... being wildly successful with IT will make your business more successful. The Phoenix Project explains why and shows you how. I have read The Goal and enjoyed it, but it wasn't until I read The Phoenix Project that I appreciated the power of combining leisure and deep-knowledge. This book does an excellent job of doing just that.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I hag no idea wat it is like I just think that the other reviews r trying to say they rather eat cow crap...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book, sad very sad, yet so interesting..... it was so amazing to me, the book was great, soooooooooooooooooooo glad peeta lives!
B006S009IY|5.0|This film was beautiful. The soft music, perfectly tailored clothes, gentle sequences in the rain; it was lovely to behold. If you can't get into this film, then you can't watch Mrs. Potter, or Emma, or any of the others. They depict a time when things were different. Sure, J.M. Barrie was controversial, but his writings, especially those that gained prominence, were magical.<br />This was magical.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it! Love how it gives you the options to play random deal's or winning deal's.  For the novice or on an off day it even has hints (if any) when you are stuck and miss a move. Plus allows you to replay a deal - if you have to just ?@^%!* beat a particular hand. Gives you something with a slight challenge during down time.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Once you see it you are hooked. This is so funny and original.  Plus the singing is great and catchy.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book as a helpful guide for anyone contemplating a relationship as well as anyone already in a relationship.  Contains good advice.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Ok, come on.  It's a cord and it works.  Not a lot to say about it.  Nothing outstanding, just a good cord.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It's something that if you liked &#34;The Bucket List&#34;  you'll enjoy this one too!  It's just appealing to see two people who have pretty much given up on life... find hope.  Hope to dream, hope to live a fuller life.  Wish these beautiful French movies could become more mainstream for american audiences, but sadly I think a lot of movies goers will miss it because it is a foreign movie.  It's a gem regardless if you have to read the subtitles.  It's very well acted, you'll get it even if you don't speak french!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's the same as the facebook version - I guess it's okay if you like this sort of game, doesn't do much for me though.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|It seemed to be in the condition advertised and I have not gotten any complaints myself, so I am happy.
0802473156|5.0|This was a great book to read with my husband in mind.  We both feel like we learned about each other by taking the quizzes, too.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Because the first book left everything hanging I decided to keep reading and I am so glad that I did. The second book delved more into what made Grey the way he is and explored more of Ana and Grey's relationship.  If you decide to start reading the series you will definitely need to read this book to get some closer and understanding. I already purchased the third book because I want to see what happens. I find myself actually rooting for them to be happy, which is opposite of how I felt at the end of book one. When I was glad for Ana's decision.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|another great season, story lines keep you interested without bogging you down each episode, can't wait to start watching season 3
B00005O3VC|5.0|Favorite movie of all of time in the history of ever and ever. Great buy. Super duper muper awesome sauce greatness.
B0035LGXXO|3.0|Okay, so it's quite crap! It is dated with the idea, the haircuts and the premise is cheesy beyond words. And talking of words, there are a lot of bad ones, but that doesn't make it cool, just more cheesy!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was very relate able for  anyone going through th  pains of Alzheimer's.  The authors ability to tell the story from patients perspective is eye opening and what I think would be realistic. I fell in love with Alice and felt that I could relate to her. The story keeps you interested from beginning to end.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Although I had watched the series as it came on, I really enjoyed watching it again. By re watching it, you get to become better acquainted with the characters and their parts in the story. It's also enlightening to the the actors out of their makeup and wigs and see what they really look like, this is on the Bonus features. Now I have to get Season three and rewatch it all over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hard. Love it. I really like how it gets harder. I can't wait for more levels to come out. Lovely graphics, too.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I feel like I'm playing Nancy drew. detective game. its pretty fun. I like solving the puzzles. I recommend it!
B0051CSIKQ|1.0|...however, that part about bombing the surrounding towns and cities with the living dead...well, I found that original.  Hense the reason I'm not crowing/growling about giving them one star.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the vampires/zombies were a lot harder to kill.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love an adventure that comes during a mundane chore like a trip to a funeral. I always hope that something like this will happen so it is fun to travel with Nei's character. Scary but not terrifying things happen but I never wanted to put the book down. It was creepy! I just wanted it to last longer!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great book by the author. I had read this book before , but it was quite a while ago.Bellucci is one of my favorite  writers<br />Gave it five stars.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn writes great character development, and her plot twists are worth it! Brilliant writing and always surprises around every corner. You begin to truly despise some of her characters!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My Horse is a fun game for horse lovers. If you play My Horse you will never get bored of it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie.  It was a great story and we would recommend it to others to see.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really good game for all of the ages and no matter it's still fun so try it man
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Excellent for a family movie night. Loved the themes and how the story moves along. Never a dull moment here.
B000001GBJ|5.0|A gorgeous CD that is beautiful to relax and<br />dance to also.  I am using it for a Waltz.<br />I recommend this CD highly
B0094POVZM|4.0|I am a Wentworth Miller fan. I watch the whole series of Prison Break and wanted to see him in this movie. The movie was surprisingly good. The story was sad in a way. It is sad how we judge others because of a person's race.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Hard to believe how fast this story unwinds A really good read.<br />It was recommended to me and I have been recommending it to other.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Nothing too challenging, just a nice book to explore. Maybe the ideas have been explored before, but that's the nature of being alive in 2013.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is a very well done implementation of the board game. The AI typically plays well (though not great) and it is a wonderful pass and play game. There is more strategy to the game then there would appear to be at first glance.<br />I have played on a Galaxy S3 and a Galaxy Tab 2 without issue.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think that Jurassic park builder is greatest building game<br />You can make dinosaurs build a park I give it a 10 out of 10
0884271153|5.0|This is a great book for folks who want to understand the sales cycle better.  It is written as a novel but everything applies to real life and can help you improve your business' position in the marketplace.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This seems pretty cool. I won my Kindle Fire at a drawing at church and this cool free bible app the way it should be.
B00915G6WQ|1.0|Awful.Was very difficult to see until the final it take a long time to see the season.  Very good to take a nap
0553801473|4.0|While my best friend has yet to catch up in the series, I expect he will love this book. It is a nicely designed book and the delivery was on time.
B00969PR18|4.0|Helpful for international travel to remote , and it allows me to use my 3g tablet for gps without having to have a data service agreement. Downside is no route autocorrection, not much in the way of poi's.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Being an 80's child I did not know much about this topic than the basics.  I enjoyed watching and learning a few things.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I  brought this movie as a gift for my mother. She have it as a VHS and she been looking for it as a DVD. I happen to come across amazon and found it. The price was right and it arrive on time. My mother love this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game because it's mindless and for some reason it's captivating.  It's extremely fun and I love it.
078401213X|5.0|I brought this movie as a gift for my mother. She love it. She has been looking for this movie. She said she saw it on Netflix and she want this movie. I found it on here and the prices was a little high, but it was worth it anyway because my mother really want this movie. It arrive on time.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I don't normally play mahjong but this was the free app of the day and I decided to go for it.  I have no issues with it and it plays well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the best game app. It is way better than temple run. The minions are awesome. I love minion rush. Everyone should have Despicable Me: Minion Rush
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie gives us a look behind the curtain, from the other side. It's good to look back and see how far we have come on both sides. Still yet how far there is to go.
B0065FEVDQ|5.0|I love shows that make me want to jump to the next episode, not drag on. If something is going to be a scary genre, it better give me nightmares like AHS(not that Paranormal Activity bull). Tate and Violet's relationship is creepy, but one good reason to watch. The small comedy every once is great, like Eric Stonestreet guest starring.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|very nice product i like the graphics and aditional content very nice movie and good quality i really recomend it
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was my first attempt at a Gillian Flynn novel and it was worth every cent. I was enthralled from beginning till end. It only happens so often in life that you accidentally come across a work of fiction that touches your psyche in such an indelible way. Great job Gillian. I can't wait to read your next novel, please hurry up and write it!

B001EBYMB2|4.0|A must watch.  One of the classics, Spend the time and watch it.  You will not be disappointed.  Full Metal Jacket is worth the time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is a super awesome game I highly recommend it it's great for any age and also it's great to play if your bored out of your mind.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who is 20months old as a first babydoll.  Perfect size.  Plus I wanted a baby with a pretty face.  Her next doll will be the next size up of Corolle.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book. Tightly written. Really connected with all characters because of the details author provides<br /> Ending was not predictable. Disturbing but sooo good.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very helpful, I use this app everyday. Mostly from home as I hate waiting for the news in the mornings..<br /><br />W
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The absolute best JRPG I've ever played. Without a doubt buy this game. The combat is deep and the story is really the best RPG story I've ever been able to be apart of.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|this is one of the best movies of 2012. I love the story, style, direction and the soundtrack is fantastic.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Great retelling of Sherlock Holmes.  Downey captures his addictive and manic side better then all who came before him in this character.  Channeling?  Mayhaps  but what a way to direct abhorrent energy!  I thought he was skirting the rough edge of reality when he did Chaplin.  So glad he has found characters like Holms and Stark to showcase his dark creative passenger and did not let it destroy him.  The man is naked when he is acting. How he has the courage to do this ...... I cannot imagine but what a thrill to watch! This is the keyed up energy I found in Sherlock when I first read him & now it is on the screen. Wow!
0786958731|5.0|Fun for the entire family.  Can't wait to try the other games in the series.  Excellent way to get into D&D (for beginners) and a fun new way for experienced players.
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|A few humorous moments but overall rather dull, contrived acting with a lackluster plot. Disappointing for what could have been a fun movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The bad reviews surprised me. I believe many questions were answered and the new twists intriguing. I can't wait for the series to continue!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|thought provoking and fun.  good twist in story.  great for any type of viewer especially if you like to stretch your mind and enjoy yourself while doing it
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie we loved it.  Shows how some people will act when in survival mode, good and bad.  One or two spots a little over the top, but for the most part very enjoyable.  no regrets
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the all time greats. Ingrid Bergman was SO beautiful. All the characters are unforgettable, especially Bogart's Rick. I was in college forty years ago when I first saw it and I have probably seen it thirty times since. Every time I see it I discover something new.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I keep getting a parse error. I get this error on all of my updates and am not able to update anything. I contacted amazon but they said they needed to get back with me and never did. Then they ignored all other emails from me. What can I do to get this to update?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had this game about a week now and still can't stop playing it. Can't say much more than that for a free game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it. This is a super addicting game and who doesn't love the minions? The missions are great and love the concept
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|i do not like the pause function, it will not allow you to get back into the action with out starting over again. You will lose  all munitions you had expended and have to purchase (real money )new munition to continue the game.<br /> The action is OK for what it is and the movement of the troops, etc, is not bad.<br />Graphics are very good.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Have used other remote desktop apps in the past but found them laggy and unstable.<br />With optimism I had downloaded Splashtop and found it to be amazingly responsive and feature rich.<br />Found my Macbook easily on wifi.<br /><br />Was totally confused on 4G setup and almost gave up.<br />Here's the secret. You must sign on to  your Gmail account in the Splashtop setup on your laptop AND sign on to your Gmail again in the phone app in the almost hidden setup.<br />After that it's super sweet!<br />I'm Skyping and remote at the same time.<br />Yeahhh babyyy!<br />From my EVO 4G (on Jellybean).
B00380URIO|5.0|Everything about this movie was excellent.  Sam's performance, the plot, everything.  So many movies are terrible now a days, it's good to stumble upon something worth while.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Sad but uplifting, the history was enlightening , the story lines riveting. I was sad that some issues were not resolved for some characters but a happy ending for all would have been unrealistic. Good for a reader looking for something different.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game was awesome the first time I downloaded it but now it just keeps crashing!! Amazon! PLEASE FIX THE BUGS IN THIS APP! I want it to work so badly!
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I have seen the newer version of Gatsby. Everyone stated it was nothing compared to the Redford one. I enjoyed this one, but maybe since had seen the other one 1st I liked it a little better. Both are great movies.
0375869026|5.0|I would recommend this reading for everyone.  It kept me really interested.  I was able to read it in four sittings.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|almost hated it. dragged on for too long and ended terribly. i was looking forward to the film, but I should have known better. I am not a fan of this director.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I became a huge fan of this series after watching the pilot episode back for season 1. I love the dynamic between Mike and Harvey and how Louis, although a complete jerk, still has you rooting for him from time to time throughout the season. I enjoyed the twists and turns in this season and can't wait to see what Season 3 brings us viewers!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you liked Downton Abbey, you will also like this. It is an incredible dramatic series that will involve all your emotions. You will laugh, cry, and get so caught up with their lives that you immediately feel like one of them. I am on the 3rd season now and look forward to the 4th. I only hope it continues with a 5th, etc.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This was a Facebook favorite, but I lost interest. The app on my Kindle fire HD has completely renewed my interest in the game.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I was sort of expecting a gray market item or a complete fake .. ( too much Internet research in the 4 weeks it took to get it ) But today it finally made it to my mailbox and I was very happy to see my Seiko Divers Auto appears to be the real McCoy ! The packaging and the way the watch was presented looked exactly like one you'd buy from a jeweler. No flaws , perfect condition , works great and and is exactly as pictured.  Would recommend this if your looking to get a sturdy everyday watch.
B00AF82WTO|1.0|I just had the misfortune to watch this abominable adaptation of Austen's elegiac, lovely, last completed novel (she was working on 'Sanditon' when she died, 'Persuasion' was published after she was gone). This version is so bad, I found myself yelling at my television for other than political reasons.<br /><br />Jane Austen wrote two endings to this novel, the one in the book, and the one she rejected; yet this latter was used in this awful TV movie: why the heck would any writer insult another by re-introducing something the initial author found unacceptable? This version is an insult to the lively, ironic spirit of Jane Austen, and is almost unrecognizable as anything she could have written. NONE of the characters here are in any way similar to what she wrote: Anne should be lovely, clear headed, yet enduring; Mary should be a clingy, spoiled, hypochondriac snob; Elizabeth should be an elegant, beautiful, cold snob; Sir Walter should be a vain, empty-headed, handsome snob; and Lady Russel should be a kindly, older, busy-body snob; (note the commonality here). Among the others, Mrs. Smith - who should be an incapacitated, yet lively and optimistic friend and whose rather minor role is of critical importance to the plot - is totally wrong here (her legs were so bad she couldn't walk, yet she is seen jogging along with Anne), and Mrs. Clay should be obvious (to everyone but Elizabeth and Sir Walter) in her scheming to marry Sir Walter, yet here, she's a nonentity. Jane Austen NEVER wrote superfluous characters, yet most of those in this thing are trotted out just because they were named in the book - their roles are eviscerated, their impact is eliminated, and their portrayal, ludicrous. Then there is Captain Wentworth: he is the hero of the novel, he is supposed to still care for Anne but still be hurt from her breaking off their engagement eight years prior, (because of Lady Russel's 'Persuasion' but I doubt anyone watching got the connection between this act andthe title, unless they read the book that is). He is also supposed to be a man of decisive action who spent years at sea, chasing down enemies. As portrayed here, he couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, but he is awfully pretty and awfully soulful, and awfully wrong for this role. Actually, no one in the cast is right for the role played, but that fact has been covered over and over in previous reviews.<br /><br />The only way I can see that anyone can have liked this movie is if they had no knowledge of the Austen novel. This is a Victorian, almost gothic, romance, scripted by someone who had no knowledge of the morals, laws, and behavior of either the late Georgian (the period of the actual novel) or the Victorian age.  I wasn't thrilled with the Amanda Root version, but in comparison to this pitiable attempt - that one is superb.
B00ALKRVTM|4.0|I'm an Agatha Christie fan and this is a great way to enjoy her on the go.<br />I bought this and the Marple collection and am happy with both purchases
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I love all of the music on this double CD! The music is great and it's nice to hear it again after so many years.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|It is a very good flash drive and I highly recommend this to everyone. I also like this design very much.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|When I pay for a game I expect the whole game. The asking price for this game should be $4.99 (not 99c) once you finish the first chapter they try to charge you that much in order to proceed. Misleading and I wont buy another game from this developer based on principal, when they start being more upfront with their games, i'll start considering their games. Furthermore there are loads of better games available for $4.99 just take a look at Shadow Gun etc. There are loads better games at that price point. Download the free version because either way youre going to be ripped off.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|The writer puts you in Reachers shoes.  You feel all his fear and anxiety. All his success and triumphs.  Brilliant!
B008JFUR10|5.0|I'll say up front, though it bears little resemblance to the monster sized dump that is Michael Bay's \\"Transformers\\" trilogy-Pacific Rim is the type of movie Bayformers should have been.  What I mean by that-is that unlike those hell spawned abominations-Pacific Rim delivers giant robots that awe and inspire instead of ones that pee on people and dangle metallic testicles.  Also unlike Bayformers you will not be forced to witness any dog humping or have to groan through lame \\"jokes\\" about red mugs in yellow rooms.  (No 45 minute long who-gives-a-crap job interview scenes in here either)<br /><br />  Thankfully-Pacific Rim does not take an uber-cool property and twist it, turn it and crush it beyond recognition into some overly long, lame one-note joke of a film.  Instead, it's completely earnest and non cynical in its delivery.  I've been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro since Pan's Labyrinth (a BRILLIANT adult fairy tale) and have gone back and watched his other films to discover what a true master of the art he really is.  I went into Pacific Rim with realistic expectations-daring to hope that it would be the movie I wanted it to be.  I left the theater transformed into a little boy filled with wonder and amazement at what I had just witnessed.  Though this film is jam packed with special effects-they serve to add to the story not to take away from it or go unnecessarily over the top (I'm looking at you Man of Steel...).<br /><br />  The Jaegers here are a marvel to behold and easy on the eyes (unlike the overcomplicated designs of the Bayformers).  The sense of scale and power they inspire is awe striking and the Jaegers are beautifully designed in every way.  In fact, the whole movie (praise to the art director) is incredibly consistent in its design-whisking us far away from the real world into the candy colored Kaiju vs. Jaeger world of the future which is EXACTLY what a good movie SHOULD do.  This film takes special effects far beyond mere gimmickry and serves them up as colorful and artistic as possible.  Even if Pacific Rim is not your kind of movie, you can't help but to be blown away by how beautiful it all is.  While the story here may not be Oscar-worthy, it's still very sound and interesting and the characters (mostly unknown actors) are very likable.  Idris Elba is good in everything he does and his role here is no different.  Charlie Hunnam also brings a lot of charisma to the protagonist.  In short, Pacific Rim is a well meaning film that knows EXACTLY what kind of film it is and it aims right for the heart of the little boy inside us all.  For me, it brought back that sense of wonder and awe my adult self had forgotten movies were still capable of delivering.  I really enjoyed playing in Guillermo Del Toro's sand box.  Pacific Rim is a monsters vs. robots smash fest and it's completely unapologetic about being exactly that.  Do yourself a favor and give Pacific Rim a look.  See it in the theater if you can for the sheer sense of scale.  Fathers take your sons to see this film too.  If movies like this continue to flounder at the box office, it's a guarantee that original ideas will cease to exist and the summer box office season will be bloated with more sequels, spin offs, reboots, etc.  Del Toro nailed this one, it's the movie his career has been building up to.  I just knew he had something spectacular up his sleeve and Pacific Rim is that film.  It's fantastic.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|200 pages into it and have no idea where I have been or where I'm going. I'm forcing myself to read it for my book club otherwise I'd stop.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|A great group of songs. It is rare to have such an excellent group of songs on one album. The remastered edition provides clarity of sound that makes it as enjoyable to listen to as if you were at a concert. I think that it is a &#34;must have&#34; for all serious music students. These tracks show a breadth of style that is rare and timeless.
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|But it's not her fault.  Carano does a pretty good job as does the stellar cast she's surrounded with.  The problem lies solely on the shoulders of director Steven Soderbergh.<br />Soderbergh is known for strong female leads and likes to make smart movies.  A movie featuring an ex-MMA fighter as a betrayed agent out for revenge almost can't fit that second part.  What should have been a fast paced, sexy action movie featuring lots of fight scenes and gunplay (which is what the previews make it look like!) is instead a plodding, lumbering dinosaur of a movie that just never gets up and goes.<br />Ultimately the movie is just boring.  The gunfights are stilted and disappointing.  The fight scenes are all the same: Carano gets hammered by which ever man she's fighting in this 10 minute segment until she lands one big spectacular shot that turns the tide and allows her to end the fight.  The only moment of excitement comes during the car chase scene more than halfway through the movie.  Too bad that scene only lasts about 2 minutes.<br />Ultimately Carano is a likable and able rising action star.  She just needs to find a better director to make her a name brand and leave Soderbergh to direct more movies featuring George Clooney.  After all, that's what he's best at.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I grew up in the church and am a leader in it, but I never understood faith until I read this book.  I listen to it all the time and have recommended it to countless folk.  No book has had more impact on me than The Secret.
B006BQFUOS|5.0|I am glad I watched this movie, but it was very hard to watch. I have kids, so this movie hit home in powerful ways. I was worried that it would be sappy, but it wasn't at all. It was very well done, and very believeable, despite what seems like an improbable concept. I haven't read the book, so I can't compare the two; but I doubt I'd be disappointed with the adaptation.
B000024IJV|5.0|In the Sixties, New Orleans piano player Mac Rebennack moved to L.A., encountered California psychedelia, rechristened himself Dr. John, The Night Tripper, and made a swamp-funk classic. Gris-gris blends New Orleans R&B, voodoo chants and chemical inspiration.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This first book by Leer Child is okay, but I'm hoping for a better story in the second book.  The book established the personal history of Jack Reacher & gave the reader insight to his persona.  I do have higher expectations for the second book.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I bought this on a whim and quite enjoyed the puzzle presented. My 8 yo daughter and I spent several fun hours on it and it's well worth the $2 on the beautiful graphics alone. I was slightly concerned after I bought it when I read a few reviews saying it didn't work properly on the kindle fire, which is what I have. When it first started loading it stayed on a black screen with a small graphic with music playing for a long time. (Remember that graphic.) I was just starting to think it wasn't going to work when it finished loading. It did this each time I loaded it so be prepared.<br /><br />The puzzles presented made both of us really think about the solutions and I must admit there a couple I couldn't figure out but she solved. We used the hints a few times but not often. When we did they usually just confirmed we were on the right track. I have only two complaints about this game.<br /><br />1. When you need to place an item and you're trying to place it in the proper area it will light up. My complaint is that you have to have it in just the right spot or it won't light up. There were a couple of times we were stuck due to that because we thought we had misunderstood the clue. However the hints led us right back to what we had already surmised. For instance, at one point we have to place a crystal on a platform however, it would never light up so we could. I was just starting to think the game was bugged when my daughter accidentally pulled the crystal down too far on the screen and it lit up. It was still at the platform but more in front of rather than over it.<br /><br />2. It was over much too soon. :) And unexpectedly. I much look forward to any similar games this company puts out.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book in the series. I felt there was entirely too much drama & it was all over the place. Extremely hard to keep up with it. The first two in this series were great & I didn't want to put them down. This book took me over a week to read because I couldn't get into it.  I was so ready for the book to be over.

B004JZBGWI|3.0|This notepad is intuitive enough to be really easy to use.  However, after about 1 month of use, the app decided that I needed to be online to use it.  It would not allow me to view several shopping lists I had made.  Long story short, I lost those lists.  I deleted the app; then re-installed it.  The issue has not recurred, but I'm holding my breath - it will probably deny access to my lists again.

B002DEZXOE|4.0|Good record of a historical event. Video much better quality than DVD version. Audio has been cleaned up in some of the acts, though soundstage sometimes spontaneously swaps from one channel to the other. Hope there's going to be a Blu-Ray version that has ALL the artists who performed there and in sequence.

B005HEDI3K|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes of the Original Star Trek, It almost makes me cry...OK, I admit it, I have cried a few tears.  Kirk's expression at the denouement just breaks one's heart. Definitely a must-see episode.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Great series, company did an outstanding job in shipment on this one perfect!
B005HED11Y|5.0|While some might find the original Star Trek too cheesy or the special effects not up to par, I love the original series. There is plenty of adventure and humor and, most of all, imagination.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have read the first and second book in this series and have been waiting for this book to come out. I loved the book and could not put it down but i was shocked when there was going to be a fourth book. I was not expecting that at the end and once reading the first and second book thought the third would tie up all the loose ends.

B004TI5N38|3.0|It was an ok book but lots of technical stuff.It had lots of excitement at times.I would recommend this book to others
B005H9B44A|5.0|I loved this movie.  As far as Marvel Comics are concerned, Thor has always been my favorite.  I did not really know how they would handle the fantastical, God-like stuff in the story, but they did an incredible job.  The acting is wonderful, the music is regal but not overdone, and Kenneth Branagh proves himself as a director here.  I hope the sequel delivers as well.
B002UD56I6|3.0|I've never been a major MJ fan, but you can't deny how popular his music was, how talented he was as a performer or how deeply his music influenced other musicians and even pop culture.  I bought this as a gift for my now ex-wife who just loves anything MJ.<br /><br />As a commercial filmmaker myself it was impressive to see just how much work goes on in the background in preparing for a live show, but was disappointed that with all the money flowing around from MJ's promoter that they couldn't have used higher quality HD cameras and production rigs for this documentary.<br /><br />I'm sure most people enjoy it because it's the last performance of MJ; I just wish they'd opted for a higher production value than what they gave it.
B00821OX98|5.0|The first episode was a little corny and boring at times.  I almost stopped watching after the first episode but decided to keep pushing through.  I am glad I did, once I made it through to the end of the season the show had quickly become one of my favorite series that is still on the air.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|How can you not like a good cartoon-character-based action flick?  No nudity, no obscene language, no gory scenes... fun for the whole family.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|A story written for young people, but yet it has deep connotations that may be hard for some of them to understand. A Very different story.  Reminds me somewhat of the story,\\"The Little Red Hen\\".
B003UESJHE|5.0|What an excellent story and, totally entertaining movie.  Until I watched this I had no idea about the history of this king - or that he was the father of HRM The Queen of England.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Works as advertised.  Many different sounds, all high quality, to suit anyone's tastes.  Found three perfect for me and mixed them.  If only I could figure out how to save the timer setting along with my mix!
0316228532|1.0|I read this book as one of the books for the year for our Book Club.  I was looking forward to reading J K Rowling's newest book but I found the book very disappointing. The writing style is poor, the characters at times confusing, did not enjoy the book at all.  I think I will wait to hear more reviews about her newest book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would have to say hands down..... better than 50 shades!!! I can't wait for the next book..... but don't want it to be so close to the end either!
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|I just said everything that I needed to in that headline but amazon won't stop bothering me about reviewing this so here it is
0743243153|5.0|Dr. Peck's classic book that I have read many times.  Due to my interest in this book, I purchased many of his other books.  He believed this book set the standard with many of his fans, however he continued writing.  I am in the process of purchasing another book by Peck.  I love his case studies, and sharing his expertise with lay persons.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel does it again. Love this guy. Great movie; well written, directed, and scored. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. It makes you think and keeps u guessing. If you like puzzles u will like this game.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|It's a decent enough story line, but it has it's cheesy parts. I'm getting real tired  of Sean Penn's schtick.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|the only thing I don't like is the 540mb requirement otherwhise its awesomely amazing<br /><br />pay no attention to this please
B005M5PENG|5.0|my nephew (Dominick) was in part on season 1, Episode 20, just in back ground, he was a waiter at restaurant
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was one of those that you just can't put down until you finish it!!!  I think it is the best of the Jack Reacher books that I have read thus far and I have read about 10 of them so far.  All of them are good, but this one was awesome.
B007712XAU|5.0|The story of the extremely wealthy and those who serve them provide wonderful viewing.  The photography and the characters , their clothes , automobiles, jewelry are fascinating to see, yet the  complexity of those serving these wealthy people provides an even greater story.
1451696191|5.0|I finally caved and bought the book everyone around me has been talking about, and now I understand why. This book is so wonderful. I find it hard to put down. At first, I wasn't too sure how I would like the format, but after the first few pages, you hardly notice. I end up staying up late reading this book! It's a great read! I would recommend it to all readers.
1781162646|5.0|As always Stephen King weaves a magical, wonderful story about the human condition! I always enjoy his stories and this one hits the spot!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I watch this when I need inspiration!<br /><br />It may be a bit too violent for some people, but you can just close your eyes on those bits like I do. The lessons of courage and fighting for freedom and the surprising level of comedy more than make up for it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you enjoy playing Mahjong, you will love this!!  I find myself looking for it during those quiet moments when you have a few minutes to yourself, and playing it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved it !! Fantastic read. I have recommend it to several of my friends. A must read, U rock Colleen!!!!
1567184855|5.0|This book was amazing.  I couldn't  put it down.  Have read it twice already!  Loved it!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of read.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Wife and I enjoyed the movie. Action and comedy. Typical Bruce Willis. Sly and cocky. A good time to watch.
B008CFN95I|5.0|Loved this book. I was taken by surprise, and delighted, as it unfolded. A wonderful merge of the old with the now.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Very addictive game and it is very enjoyable any one looking for something to pass time with should get this oh problems is you may not be able to stop playing it.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I couldn't find a connection to Strayed's thoughts or motivations. Every decision she made seemed like a terrible one and I didn't get a sense that she had learned anything from her trek. She seemed like she had a death wish as she started on the trail with her lack of preparation or knowledge and made it seem like she survived the wilderness using her good looks to charm help from fellow backpackers. Apparently in this case, Darwinism didn't win... I just wasn't impressed and I doubt I'd recommend this as a read to anyone.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|I love to look at my Maddie gallery and enjoy them all over ahain.  What a fun book. Maddie's tricks put joy into a boring day.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a good fast paced combo of hero's while introducing a new line of evil at the same time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! It is a really good game, not a waste of time or money. Can't wait to finally see the movie.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Initially I was into this book.  Storyline and characters interesting.  After the reveal, the plot started to drag out and I felt like the second half of the book could've been edited better and consolidated into 1/3 of the length.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked it.  Fun game. Agree with other post, did remind me of must series.  My only complaint is that is was too short!! Would love to have played for many more hours.  I hope fireproof makes another one soon.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Greatly written and acted. One of my favorites in the genre. I've liked Casino more until recently that I have been watching Goodfellas and it has in a way caught up with Casino for me.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|it is a really good game and I love playing it. my favorite thing to do is eat. the swimmers... DONT JUDGE ME!
B003F44QRQ|5.0|It is a film I enjoyed the first I watched it in its release of 1987. The story, the soundtrack, the acting. Loved the cast at once and I have watched it many times on vhs, now I have it on dvd and will watch it here too on Amazon.
030758836X|5.0|Although this is not my all time favorite novel (that honor goes to 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez), it is, by my standards, the most brilliantly crafted. I truly could not put it down. I went through all 700 plus pages in one sitting. Yet, it's not one of those archetypal, addictive thrillers, that like a snicker bar, keeps you wanting more, only to incite disappointment when it's all finished. It's one of those few novels where the style, plot line, and characters fascinate and engage, without missing a beat, from beginning to end.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I need this everyday!!!! I have so many software licenses I could scream but I will never give up evernote !
B00284BMBM|5.0|Up until I received this my chance to listen to Daughtry's music was limited. I love this and thank you!
1416575464|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book after reading all the great reviews.  It is simply a picture book of interiors from the houses of  domino's design team. Don't buy if you want to learn about interior design concepts.
B00002MZ2T|3.0|There is really only one song on this CD that I care for. Too bad it wasn't as good as their first CD.
1451695195|5.0|A book everyone should read regardless of their beliefs in life after death. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B00BP4X3W2|3.0|I must say that I'm surprised how this movie won so many awards.  I didn't see one person that even resembled a true prisioner of the camps. I saw one dirty Jewish star on one coat at the very end and that was about it.  They, through the whole story, were fully clothed and clean, not one was under weight. I guess I feel that glossing over the reality of this tragedy is only going to make some willing to see it happen again. I understand it is a story of one mans effort to help but the film itself didn't move me.  No one should make a movie, with this subject and have it not move the people watching it.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We ordered this pool for my daughters first birthday party after leaving the first pool we bought at my in-laws house in another state.  I was skeptical that it was really as fabulous as the earlier reviews indicated…  It is even BETTER!  We had approx. 10-12 children ranging from 3 months to 7 years playing in the pool (at different times) and it was a HUGE hit for all age groups.  It is large enough to accommodate several children at one time without feeling crowded and the toys it comes with are a huge bonus!<br />Our lawn is not level and the instructions specifically say it needs a level surface but not to put it on concrete.  We purchased interlocking exercise mat tiles to put on top of the cement patio and under the pool for a softer/ level surface.  ([[ASIN:B0085XLTGS B0085XLTGS]]  They were perfect for kids who like to play rough and made the pool so much nicer under foot.<br />I cannot more highly recommend this pool.  It inflated pretty quickly, did not have holes and my daughter loves it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though I knew some of the events that were going to happen, I still felt the tension.  The series depicts the time period and social structure very well.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Play is not proper, subtitles (showing where necessary -- foreign actors interacting .,..)don't appear. Misses video often. Doesn't group or categorize videos properly.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin:  are you giving Rebus a new career?  I love his handling of situations, so unconventional and so right
B00CWY76CC|2.0|At level 10 your forced to review the game.  Therefore I am rating low as I dont like to be forced in order to advance.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I look forward to talking more to my kids about a movie that is funny to them AND also full of principles-generosity, love, and prioritization.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|This movie is quite good.  It held my interest very well, and I never get bored of watching it.  I like that it's scary, and has scenes that make me jump.  I liked the acting in it as well.  It's also nice for it not to have vomiting scenes, and there aren't a lot of the twisting body scenes.  I'd recommend this.  I haven't seen The Exorcist, but I have a feeling this is a lot better than that!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awsome game it is a good way to train a real horse and I love racing in the compention and I say to try too play it and the best thing is you can get it for free
B0095MVOMC|1.0|It loaded, set up, played music, showed the menu; I selected to play, then selected the scene and blackness... then back to my home screen. Crashed. POO
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game tests your powers of observation and cognitive thinking. In the final rooms there were so many codes needed for the locks I had to start writing them down. I wish the instructions were a bit more thorough. It would be nice if you quit the program with a room half finished, it would remember what you had solved (instead of having to do it all over).<br /><br />Overall, lots of fun! I look forward to them expanding the number of rooms!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down until I had read all of the words written in it. Front to back, no skimming or skipping. I could see it all happening, and I was a prisoner to my brain. It wanted to know all. Delightfully dangerous and surprisingly sorrowful.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Spectacular and the costumes were divine. And of course the acting was incredible also. It is a film for great insight into history<br />  Ariel R.
B00006879E|5.0|If you're a Maroon 5 fan...this is a must have!  Great CD!  I still have more Maroon to buy...lots of hits on this one!
0142000655|5.0|It would be Steinbeck.<br />I feel he grabs you at every level ...in his storyline, his thoughtful summation, his character development.....everything.<br />His books never get stale or have undertones of a man who ran out of ideas. I can name a few best selling authors who become so boring after a while. Predictable.....and lacking the edge their writing had at one time. Many have lost me after the first few books.<br />This man is not one of them.<br /> And this book is a favorite of mine out of his collection......characters are so multi leveled.....so lush, if you read it a few times ( which I do with books I enjoy) you will walk away with something undiscovered the first time and important.<br />If you enjoy looking deep into a persons mind and spirit and really seeing what few do, this is the writer for you.
B001NA6096|5.0|Watched the first two in the series in preparation to see the third.  All 3 are now among my favorite movies.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Website is not user friendly and seems to be just a hodge bodge of junk nothing tested nothing true 'try it it says' and after you have spent the money to try it is not good or doesn't work dumping it.
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|Good flow, great music. Can't go wrong. Great for the car traveling. You will love it. Enjoy!!! It's a lovely blend.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. Can't get it to work. Keeps closing on me. I've forced closed, cleared cache and data. Still kicks me out.
0060527986|1.0|I like that this book has truth. However, it's really a short little bit of info, you can read the whole book in about 30 minutes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool either way survival or creative it the best game in survival you can fight zombies,skeletons,spiders,and other mods and in creative you can build what ever you want and you can fly you can do two player in this game I hope this help because this game is awesome!
B005LJITS0|3.0|I actually enjoyed this movie. Watched it twice, story line was kinda cool! I do love sci-fi! I recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is great and all but the graphics are not the best that they could be, but they are pretty good still. if you don't really care about the picture really then you should get this game.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I decided to buy this book when I saw its info in Dr Wayne Dyer's Facebook page.  I have not finished it yet, but so far I find it very interesting.  There are many questions answered in a way that makes sense.  I think this is the book I was looking for.
B00B7807PM|5.0|This has been one of the funnest and most addicting television series we have seen in quite some time. The characters, story, and cultural and historical issues are interwoven into the plot to make for a compelling and engaging drama. This TV series triumphs!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|what a fantastic read, I was riveted by the revelations about the creation of a perfectly silent Kaleb and the power of a bond so powerful that it can save an entire race of people. Could not put it down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|woohoo nice game imangi studios I could not believe that the sequel of temple run was very high def cool
0547260695|5.0|thank you so much! i love it so much!!! Thanks a again for making up my day! Thanks you very much
0061900656|4.0|My son likes reading this book now that he is a big brother. The new baby is not mentioned to be boy or girl so the story works well for families who don't yet know the gender of their new baby.
014241493X|5.0|This book is kind of like Dash & Lilly's book of Dares with the whole follow the clues thing. Except THIS was better. There were points in this book where I started crying for no reason and I had to finish it in one day because I had to know... I couldn't stop thinking of the story and I had to know how it ended. Great book.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Bruce Willis tried to hard to be funny.  He should have stop at the last Die Hard.  Hopefully this is the last
0525478817|5.0|John Green is a great human. I suggest any of his books. Go forth and read them all! They will touch your heart!
B0094WK9GU|4.0|I love SHM but there were too many overlapping songs form their other album. The new songs are great though.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is always good.  Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Deleting from device there are better apps available why change what works?  So long weather channel word word word eord
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Loved this book when I first read it in 5th grade & I still love it now.  It's a very quick and easy read, too. I read it over the course of a weekend.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app is ok, not as good as weather channel, it is rather limiting when compared to the weather channel app.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good game play and the contents are attractive!if you want to play a kind of kill devil game and be a hero,this is the good choice. The display,graphics all good.in my kindle fire HD, the game performed very smoothly. Exciting!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the Weather channel app, where I can get  the weather in whatever manner I want - by the hour or for 10 days at a time. Great!
B000002JSP|5.0|Big Zeppelin fan and I misplaced my other copy of this one. I'm &#34;Old-School&#34; and I like to have a hard copy of my music...and besides, I was part of the listening tests in Hannover, Germany back in the early '90's to determine who's algorithm would become the standard for MP3 coding and I know first hand that all of the MP3's AND digital downloads of music suffer significantly in sound quality when compared to live, Cd and even LP's.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! This shows whenever I open my phone, and the numbers are actually big enough to read without glasses, an added bonus.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you have only seen these on television and like me, can watch them over and over again, then you will thoroughly enjoy them on Blu-ray. There is the original presentation option AND the enhanced option...both are good.
B004N6369Y|5.0|A gentleman of every aspect loves his daughter and you watch her from childhood<br />to an adult with respect that she wants to manage Hotel Vendome in all parts.  It is my favorite story.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This presentation leaves no doubt that Michael Jackson was in full control and was NOT some doped up musician. He knows what everything should sound and look like and he was going to present an amazing show.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Lots of nice special fx, nice storyline, great make-up on the witches.  The language had the occasional foul word, which could have easily been omitted, but I guess Hollywood must think the whole country must speak like a bunch of sailors on shore leave. . . Overall, I would have given it 3.5 stars.  It was worth the money.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The game looks and handles well and almost all vehicle controls work and make sence, much better than I had anticipated for a free game. Well done developers I am thoroughly enjoyed and impressed with this game, ceep up the good work
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I didn't think I'd find another game as frustrating as Candy Crush Saga. Well, this is it. I'm not &#34;hooked&#34; just tired of the frustration of of trying to clear bubbles that don't end up in &#34;drops&#34; (cascades) like CC. Would seem challenging and perhaps to many it is. Not worth my time. Would suggest another King Saga-Pet rescue-put aside cute animals and it is fun, frustrating and makes me come back.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|The show kept me hooked on it and I wanted to know was going to happen next. I would advise anyone who is thinking of watching it to watch it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Really helped me appreciate what they did, hearing all of these old hits on one CD. Lots of great old songs to remember.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much before my niece took it off the divide and my high score was over million and it is so much fun to play.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So inspirational. This book is amazing. It speaks the truth about cancer kids, which these days, are h as rd to come by
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome and amazing book. I stayed up way too late reading but I couldn't help it! It was hard  to find a stopping place!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The children love it so much. I don't play this game but my kids loved it. I order it for them free on Internet and they love playing it.
B000025XKM|5.0|Beautiful Sunday morning music. It's one of those CD's that you discover something new each time you listen to it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I don't play this game but my kids loved it. I order it for them free on Internet and they love playing it.
6305428352|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. As a band director this movie always hits home.  Would encourage anyone to watch it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I recommend this documentary to absolutely anyone and everyone. It is very eye opening as to how the food industry works and how poor quality America is getting on the grocery store shelves. The man in the movie asks the question, \\"where is my food coming from?\\" and I think we should all be asking that question and this movie just starts to answer that. I love this movie and encourage anyone to give it try, and also eat local and healthier whenever possible!
B003TO5414|5.0|This is one of the best series Masterpiece Theater has ever presented.  Sherlock and Dr. Watson are brilliant - both actors compliment each other well.  Can't wait for the next season 3.  This is a requirement!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing The Room. I wasn't sure if it would be very challenging as a lot of these kind of games aren't. However, it was very detailed and I can't wait for the next installment!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|You've got to love this series.  It's so well done.  It's brilliant!  Sherlock, Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson and of course, Moriaty.  So looking forward to Season 3.  It is coming!!!!
B000GCFG7E|2.0|In this 10th book the storyline is okay. The beginning started off good. The story can be very slow moving & at times boring. This story has very little action. I only finished this book to see how it would end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Husband uses all the time while on computer.  At first there may have been some issue getting the sound to work but once he figured that out he uses them all the time.  Haven't seen him use it while playing online games which was the intended use but he listens to his music with these all the time.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This story is very entertaining and the narration adds even more to the quality of the product.<br />I would recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Freaking amazing. Can't get enough of it. I absolutely love the minions to pieces. Can't wait for the second movie to come on Dvd so I can add it to my collection. Have seen the second in the drive ins and it made it so much cooler on a big screen.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is an awsome game, maybe a little to easy but even so it's hours of fun and also a lot of funny things and alternative missions with paradox of famous movies and other surf.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Mindless pregnancy humor.  Was a good laugh on a rainy day.  Still need 10 words to get this review to publish...
B005OYKI1I|5.0|vin diesel, the rock ohhh hot hot hot. cant wait to see 6 or when 7 to come out in 2014.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Very easy. I have this app on my phone but on my kindle its a bit different. I actually like it better.
B00005QW4K|5.0|The DVD is is presented like an actual burned bootleg version. It sort of fooled me but it is sort of cool! It is however a factory pressed DVD. The transfer is perfect! This, in my opinion, is the best version of this film. I highly recommend it to anyone and it is a very welcomed edition to anyone's Evil Dead DVD collection. If one possesses the Evil Dead series, it is INCOMPLETE without this movie! So, get it now, while the getting is good!
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|This is the first of the post-David Crosby Byrds, and is a refreshing change.  Still the jangle of McGuinn's 12-string Rickenbacher, but taken to new corners of the rock and roll universe.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Fine John Ford western, if you are a fan of Westerns. Good performances by Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, and Lee Marvin.
B0012GMW34|5.0|This album is like putting two somewhat competitive brothers together, and just letting them impress one another, riffing away on John Coltrane tunes (Love Supreme), and others, and making them their own.  A guitarist's text book of speed licks, but also with taste.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This is absolutely a great movie! It is adventurous, imaginative, romantic, and climatic.  Definitely one that I would watch again.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I am so happy with this product, my step daughter love it, and i received the product exactly on her birthday.
B00008FRWR|1.0|I bought this album hoping to finally get a copy of Division Bell.  The seller had \\"brand new import pressings\\" of Division Bell.  Well, I got the album and what a disappointment.  The album is very compressed.  Absolutely no dynamic range.  The mids are OK, but there is a total lack of bass and bottom end.  In fact, the CD blows this album away, and I have a very high end turntable set up.  What a let down.  All of my other Pink Floyd LP's sound great.  Dark Side of the Moon LP makes the CD sound flat.  Momentary Lapse of Reason gives you shivers when you hear how well it sounds.  All I can say is BEWARE of anyone selling NEW releases of Division Bell.......YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really really like this game. It is great. even tho  it's hard to get the new fish its great
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun and you just collect the bananas and you get to spend them on the cutest little outfits. One word for the game .......... AWESOME.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I will watch it. . I was so excited that I bought a 3d tv that I had to have any 3d dvd's and this was one of my only options. I have looked at it since just not really interested in watching it or anyother 3d movies. Funny how that worked. Had to have a 3d tv though. LOL
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My 5 year old daughter and I love playing this game.  Sometimes it's hard to put the game down and walk away.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This is a well written, structurally completed suspenseful book that is a page turner… I enjoyed the action however; some of the Catholic Church related items are not 100% correct.  But as long as one keeps that in mind and that this is a work of fiction, it is an enjoyable book.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Like all the rest of james rollins books, I couldn't put this one down.  Next, I can't wait for the sequel of blood gospel!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|The app is not intuitive in use, it is difficult to understand and use.  Other apps on the web seem to have a better performance and I have tried them but for $0.99 it is not a make or break deal.  Save the buck on this one and give it to charity...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun! I am not very good at it yet ; it's a lot like Subway Suffers but with cute little minions! I like it. ****************
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|When I opened the book and began reading the introduction, I couldn't stop laughing. Fun, light read worth checking out.
B00006AW2P|5.0|I can remember when the five boys from England known as The Rolling Stones hit the airwaves in America and I found their music quite a bit different from that of the Fab Four. Still, I enjoyed a few of their earlier records, including what I assume was their first. I wish I could remember who I knew doing Not Fade Away, but I liked the song. I of course remember the theme from Route 66 although I never watched the show. I also liked Walking the Dog. There were two other albums of theirs I got from Amazon which I will review separately. I will add that after these efforts, I guess their show got a little too raunchy for me so I stuck with the Beatles, and later the Animals, but I am glad I got this collection of their songs to enjoy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very entertaining show that will keep you interested as each character is developed. Great writing for each episode and I hope the other seasons stay true to the first.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|All the other reviews I read made me decide to purchase this book and I am glad I did. Read his other books but this book with this character is the best by far. Just purchased the second book!
B00BHMF578|3.0|after having a few friends rave about this movie, i gave it a shot w/pretty high expectations... i guess it's my fault.. to think that Ben Affleck could really play a decent role in anything.  If he's a CIA agent, then I'm Santa Claus.  argo ho ho ho yourself
B000I9U8VO|3.0|It is a interesting story and I would recommend that you watch 'Wolverine' and ' X- Men' before you watch this one.<br />Understanding how these characters feel is very easy even though I don't have a jet, or am involved in saving the world to an extreme extent. I have to say that it is a very exciting story, and I was emerged into it. Swearing and the use of Gods name in vain, in pure behavior, and the attitude of some of the characters is why I gave it a lower rating, but other then the down falls I like it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I read a how to write a Kindle book and this book was recommended. I gained some additional information related to formatting and uploading your book. I would highly recommend this free and short easy read.
1594204217|5.0|Pollan is scientist, nutritionist, sociologist, historian, theologian, comedian all in one - but not heavy on  any of it!  The science is easy to understand; the theology very general (quotes from sacred texts); and the comedy, (mostly personal experience) rings true.<br />I enjoy his stories, and am in awe of his literary style.  A fun book for anyone to spend time with.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|enjoyed this book and it held my interest to the very end. He did a fine job of keeping the interest up
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never have I ever been so in love with a tv show. Downton Abbey gives me a sense of bliss every time.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|this book was very confusing to me, and very slow and did not hold your interest I was disappointed in it
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I find Flynn's writing to be so compelling. I can't put her books down. However, this book's story line grew to be disturbing.  Too much focus on mental illness as it pertained to the main character's past.  Also, the main character's major flaws were hard to handle because of the way they encouraged her to mess up the good things in her life.  We read this for book club, and we all agreed that the writing style and story did keep us up all night until we finished it. But we all also agreed that the main story line and solution to the mystery were disturbing.
B0083Z614S|5.0|My mom's been recommending this book for years, and so I read it with my daughter. It is one of the best books I've ever read. It's magnificently written; a finely polished work that reads like an extended poem. Truly extraordinary literature of the highest order.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I thought the mixing of all those type A personalities resulting in the clashes that it did rather than the usual smooth blending was really funny. loved this. Doesn't hurt that it has all the star power of the individual movies.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book.  Really fast read.  Downloaded really well.  I downloaded to my phone thought I wouldn't like reading it on my phone but actually loved it.  Great.
0062280228|5.0|This book incites feelings of profoundness, sadness and wonder. It is encourages introspection through a tacit exposition of some of life's most intriguing and complex questions. It isn't saturated with emotionally charged tragedy, but envelops the reader by impressionistic inquiries into life, sacrifice and choice. A poignant novel that leads adults to ask many of the same questions that the Narnia Chronicles ask of children....
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Was loaned a copy and it was excellent. Series one of my favorites to watch. Will order Season 4 pretty soon,
159463176X|2.0|Though Khaled Hosseini proved himself a gifted writer in his first book KITE RUNNER, and though he has some magical moments in this story, the entire fabric of it doesn't hang together well, long stories are told of people who add little, time sequences are annoyingly disjointed, and the promise of the beginning chapters of this book (which are 5 star) never resolve in anything close to a satisfactory manner.  And like my previous sentence, Mr. Hosseini is overwhelmingly in love with long sentences divided by commas. Though he uses beautiful phrases at times, overall, the book is sadly a disappointment.<br />Every new writer, as any singer who is 'discovered' on a national talent program...should follow instant success NOT by cranking out several more efforts while the 'market is hot', but by stepping back to hone his/her craft.. (which sadly seldom gets done). Where was the editor on this book!?<br />[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]]
014241722X|2.0|Book for kids entertainment not the usual John Grisham. I was very disappointed. It was boring for an adult.<br />Sorry I bought
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is like the other games with a hair salon because if u missed up u can go to grow  a then there is no levels for the game and there's no timer it a good game. Buy it
014242613X|2.0|This book is for kids, somewhat like Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. Good reading for young adults. All the books in this series are much the same
B000I0QL82|4.0|Astaire and Bing are fantastic. Opening an Inn, for holidays only, doesn't sound like the best business plan. In fact, it wasn't, but the music and dancing was delightful.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I really don´t know anything about photograpy, in this book the autor explain easy everything that you need to understand the bases to take good pictures. I like a lot to find exercises to practice all the theory tha he has explained. I recommend to buy this book.

I recommend it for anyone who is tired of poisoning their body with today's toxic food choices.  You will learn how your body works and how to keep it working the way it should. Highly, highly recommended!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|So excited to read this! I loved the series and looking forward to finding out who the Ghost is and moving forward!
B001OGWY1W|2.0|Movie was okay but would not watch again. But that could due to the quality of the picture. Who can watch something that keeps reloading.
B000059T1E|5.0|Perhaps the most direct and simple album done by Traffic either before or after Blind Faith.  A true classic filled with great songs that sounds more like a jam session than the tight recording it really is.  Winwood's vocals and keyboards shine throughout and neither Jim Capaldi or Chris Wood ever seem out of place.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Good special affects but story line was not up to James bond standards. It just didn't have the excitement of other bond movies. would not watch again.
B009R659L8|5.0|Just when I thought I could figure out who done it, she does it again! There are few books that I can't put down but MHC's are seldom like that and this is one of her best's. I keep thinking her books may end up being the same but she manages to keep it fresh and mysterious each time. Only thing I wasn't quite sure about was the title and how it related.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I own all six seasons of this show and I watch it at least once a year straight through. Fringe was very good, Invasion was fun, Harsh Realm was surprising, Xfiles was terrific, but LOST is the creme de la creme of religion/supernatural/evil versus good/ and fantasy all rolled in to one FABULOUS addictive show with UNFORGETTABLE acting. &#34;John Locke, Substitute.&#34;  &#34;I've got your back.&#34;  &#34;Dude...&#34; every word said in the most memorable way. Now I watch Person of Interest. Also a great show with some Lost actors (including the great Benjamin Linus).
B003UN409Q|1.0|Too weird. Was looking forward to the story about Jim Morrison and I really like Val Kilmer, but I could really have done without the LSD trips through director's/Jim Morrison's eyes. Have to admit I turned it off halfway through.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Wonderful sounds and easy set up. Love that you can mix the perfect combinations to suit your mood. I would recommend this app to anyone and everyone.
044024613X|3.0|I found this story to be a good one and a psychological thriller.  However, there was virtually no relief from the dark pallor throughout the entire book.  Those of us who understand the field of Psychology could figure out the plot midway through the book.  The characters were realistic and well &#34;fleshed out,&#34; although sometimes I wondered why they couldn't see the obvious.  The end was dramatic and interesting; however, I was left with a sense of sadness myself.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I really haven't followed the Marvel movies but my kids wanted to see this so I streamed it through Amazon Prime.  It was somewhat predictable but the dialogue was smart and funny and the whole thing was very entertaining.  The special effects of creating a tiny Steve Rogers were mostly seamless.  And I thought Hugo Weaving was great.  Of course, I always think Hugo Weaving is great!
B00AAAKH80|5.0|Had to buy their album after seeing them open up for Luke Bryan.  What a fun group of songs and they are great live.
B00004U8P9|5.0|it's as good as I remember it, funny and slightly off color, but pretty good. Packaging was great and movie arrived in good condition.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|Just like &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;, Zeptolab has come up with another great game that could potentially be a hit. However, unlike some reviewers here, I would rather have paid for this game. I don't appreciate the constant ads as well as having to purchase hints (which makes me feel as if Zeptolab has gotten a bit greedy as they could possibly make more money this way). If I had the option to purchase the game without ads and with free hints I would have rated it much higher.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|it was every bit as good as the book, very entertaining and not a boring minute during the entire movie.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Always wondered what might happened to souls after death. Then began to learn about concepts wherein the soul never dies but is reincarnated. This book opened my eyes to what is to come for me after the death of this earthly body and what has been going on before I was reincarnated this time. I highly recommend this volume.
B0090SI460|5.0|I love this movie and now it's great to have 3 different ways to watch. I really love the option of the digital copy to take anywhere.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. I like to play with my friend and family and my little sister love to play this game also.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|It differed some from the book, but to fit it in a standard time period there had to be some 'poetic' license. Very enjoyable movie and arrived ahead of schedule.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Great quick read.  The story is laugh out loud funny. This not a steamy steamy novel but a good<br />Bad boy turn love sick man story.  His niece almost steals the book. She is too cute.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|A little bloody, but over all an entertaining movie, more for adults than children due to the blood and scare factors.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Movie done well. Ben Affleck seamlessly becomes the character and you forget who he is. After watching this and Zero Dark Thirty, you realize it is not our government that keeps us safe but dedicated citizens who really care and are committed to their job and beliefs.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Must have DVD if you are a BBT fan. This show is absolutely hilarious and there is nothing else like it on the market! Worth giving a shot. You won't regret it.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I can't believe Tom Hanks and Halle Berry starred in this movie. The knock-off part of the Matrix was terrible - even making up someone to look kind of like Keanu Reeves. The basic premise is reincarnation and it was presented very badly. The movie jumped around time frames but you still knew exactly what was going to happen - unfortunately. Do NOT waste your money on this thing.

B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I liked watching the story and watching  Jake Gyllenhall develop the leading man into the man he was capable of being. The main characters are very likable in this movie and I enjoyed the story line. Without spoiling it, the story addresses topics not often tackled  in movies like chronic diseases and inadequate healthcare.

B0055D3EFU|5.0|If you're looking for a way to stay awake, forget the caffeine and watch this.  Not only will your blood be racing but you won't be falling asleep anytime soon.  Easily the best movie to come out of the horror genre in the last 5 years (besides Cabin in the Woods)!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love this app for checking weather anywhere.  Just liked it better before this new format.  Some things are better left alone.
B006Y5EDRG|2.0|While the stars in this series are undeniably talented and gifted, I find the series to be morally offensive given its highly charged sexual atmosphere.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is an awsome game the only negative is that it freezes up and takes a long time to load but other then that it is really fun

B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game is enjoyable for you to past the time.  I recommend this game to those who wants too play a game where you don't have to think much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's a creative twist on other fun apps like subway surfers but you'll not get tired of playing as fast because it will be different the further on go. It does take up some space and is a download time but worth it being free.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|l've had the weather channel app on my kindle for over a year, loved it and used it every day.  Now the app has been changed to include extras that earn you points for some reason, l can't read the weather advisories, and the the screen setup is never the same when l open the app.  Bitterly disappointing- have switched to the NOAA app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|:) Great game. Keeps the mind thinking. Wish more levels were available. Can't wait to see what the next rooms look like.

140006922X|3.0|Reading Reza Aslan's short history of Islam, \\"No God but God,\\" one quickly understood the book's purpose.  As a Western educated theologian, Aslan wished to take Islam back to its roots.  He sought to compose a portrait of the prophet Mohammed that was enlightened and egalitarian.  Likewise, by \\"contextualizing\\" early Islam, he sought to redefine certain key terms, as well as crack the veneration of the prophet that has with the centuries has grown akin to worship, ironically making the great idol-shatterer into an idol-in-spirit. Scholars raised many legitimate questions about Aslan's arguments.  He gave short shrift to the cultural context of pre-Islamic Arabia.  His discussion of the rise of the Shi'a/Sunni rupture read too much like tragic high fiction and not enough like Machiavellian realpolitik.  Yet these criticisms missed the point: Aslan's goals were less historical than theological.  As has been true with Christianity since before Martin Luther, a reconsideration of the past can often light a path that takes believers into a brighter future.<br /><br />While such new examination of Mohammed is relatively recent, the \\"historical Jesus movement\\" has been on-going for more than 200 years.  As such, Aslan's purpose with his newest book, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" is something of a mystery.  What exactly does Aslan have to add to the reconstructionist project?<br /><br />The answer seems to be not much.  While Aslan's fluid precisely observed prose make for a good read, his book does not seem to add much of anything to an already rich vein of scholarship. For example, one expects that few readers will be surprised that Jesus of Nazareth was born a Jew, lived as a Jew, and died as a Jew in a deeply Jewish context.  Perhaps some will be unaware of the extent of Roman brutality, the meaning of messianism in Jesus's milieu, and/or the degree to which Paul of Tarsus constructed out of Jesus a character that neither he nor his Apostles would have recognized.  Such readers will no doubt find this book interesting.  Aslan likewise does a good job painting the factionalized ferment that was Roman Judea and discussing - albeit a bit too deterministically -- how it gave rise to the Jesus movement.  That said, lots of authors have produced work at least as strong as Aslan's and in many cases with more nuance and better scholarship.<br /><br />Aslan does a do good job brushing away the layered stories that smother the life of the historical Jesus.  Some Christians will surely find this troubling.  Contrary to a newly popularized and often repeated claims, the historical Jesus status of a carpenter did not mark him as \\"middle class\\" (a designation that didn't exist in that period).  Quite the contrary, carpenter represents a poor translation of tekton, a term which meant builder or day laborer and was applied by Romans to the great mass of illiterate Israelite peasants.  Likewise, one can safely assume that the historical Jesus was either wholly or nearly illiterate.  Christians will almost certainly share the early Christians trouble with Jesus relationship as a disciple to John the Baptist, a topic to which Aslan gives considerable attention.  Again, born a poor Jew, Jesus died a poor Jew, at the hands of a Roman governor with so much Jewish blood on his hand the whole Jordan River could not have washed those stained hands clean.<br /><br />My issue with Aslan's analysis arises from his tendency to take issues of great controversy and present them as settled. Since he eschews citations, readers will be left taking his word for claims and methods which many scholars would dispute.  In terms of facts, time and again Aslan makes assertions that range from the problematic to the likely incorrect. Take for example his unsupported claim that the author of Luke's Gospel was like the author of Mark and Matthew \\"...a Greek speaking Diaspora Jew.\\"  This view runs contrary to the vast majority of scholars, who see Luke as a Gentile, writing for Gentiles, drawing on only limited original Jewish sources.  Of course Aslan has every right to side with the minority scholarly view here, but he should make that plain to his reader rather than simply asserting his opinion as fact. The same can be said of Aslan's belief in a late dating for Mark's Gospel.  Again, that puts him within the range of scholarly opinion, but on an issue where people make strong arguments on both sides.  With regards to Mark, Aslan is in the majority when he argues that it was written for a Roman gentile audience.  Still, he not only fails to recognize the very existence of differing views, but also misses the most interesting thing about Mark's Gospel - that while written by a Jew for gentiles, the gospel's theology represents a deeply Jewish Christian text and that it advocates an Adoptionist world view (that Jesus was not born divine, but adopted later by God), an idea that was declared heretical at Nicaea.<br /><br />I was likewise uncomfortable with Aslan's tendency to pick and choose passages from the various Gospels to construct his Jesus.  As the excellent scholar Bart Ehrman cleverly pointed out, many tend to read the Christian Scripture as if there was a Gospel of \\"MarkMatthewLukeJohn.\\"  This is plainly not the case.  Each Gospel exists as a literary whole and each offers Jesus in a different light. In Mark, he is a rabble rousing insurgent who suffers terribly.  In John, a divinity with only the barest grasp on the world (which explains why the former was a popular text among Jesus Jewish followers and the latter among Gnostics).  The Jesus who in death yelled \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" (Mark and Matthew) isn't the same Jesus as the one who says, \\"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit (Luke) or the one who calmly reports \\"it is done\\" (John) before bowing his head to death.  Aslan asserts a common consistent narrative where none can be found.<br /><br />One must also wonder at Aslan's narrative about the spread of Christianity through the Roman Empire, a subject about which scholarly controversy abounds. One thing is certain, his claim that the Nicene Creed was \\"...merely codifying a creed that was already a majority opinion...of the entire Christian community\\" will send more than a few heads spinning.<br /><br />In the end, Aslan's \\"Zealot\\" offers an interesting account.  He constructs a highly readable narrative about how the \\"zeal\\" of First Century Judea gave rise to Jesus and his movement.  Many will praise Aslan for the ease with which he presents that material.  I only wish he had been more trusting of his readers' ability to digest questions with no ready answers instead of time and again coming down on the side of simplicity and clear answers.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is, by far, one of my favorites of 21st century literature. The story moves lin epistolary form, like DRACULA, and it moves swiftly but still leaves the reader wanting more but not in a bad way, if that makes any sense. The entire war is woven together by diverse stories told by a variety of people all over the world. Its social commentary is difficult to miss but it's not overbearing. While one of its themes is certainly the old adage, \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" the complexities and vulnerabilities felt by those who suffered through it are not as simple to summarize in one pat sentence. Tragedy, cynicism, and hope -- they're all there!

B008220C38|2.0|Anna Karenina novel is one if the classics that is on a must read list of any serious liberal arts major.  Set in late 1800s it is time when women were considered to be their husband's property.  Anna's husband is prosperous, he is respected politician but he is also much older than her, controlling and very much aware that his wife loves their son Sergey more than she loves him.  As fate will have it, Anna meets handsome count Vronsky who is a very good looking, young aristocrat making his career in the military.  For the first time in her life, she falls madly in love.  While Anna is willing to give up everything for her love, including her son, Vronsky has less of a character and decides to leave her when he realizes that publicly, they will never be accepted as a couple in a high society.  And that is the end of Anna.<br /><br />Costumes in this film are absolutely wonderful. Actresses wear magnificent jewelry and their hair is breathtaking.  But I was put off by the way director filmed the movie.  It is almost make to look like a stage performance.  Many of the scenes are highly exaggerated: dance at the ball, office where Anna's brother works in the office and endless stream of paperwork.<br /><br />Many who have read the novel often wondered what would happen to Anna and her beloved if they did end up getting married?  Would they be happy or would \\"life\\" happen to them too? Keira Knightly was wonderful choice for the role of Anna - fresh face with beautiful classical facial features, dark eyes and wild hair.  I just did not like Alexey Vronsky's mustache.  It looked too pompous and I could not imagine any woman taking him seriously.  Tolstoy tells the story of love and reason.  The two usually do not go together.  It is usally when love is not strong enough that reason takes over and then it simply becomes practial for all parties involved.  The older I get the harder it is for me to believe that life is simply about that. Life should not be just about duty and responsibility - there must be some joy and happiness in it too....  Watch the movie and you be the judge.  After all, we are all makers of our own destinies.nd responsibility - there must be some joy and happiness in it too....  Watch the movie and you be the judge.

0399162097|5.0|I've been reading a lot of fun, enjoyable books this summer, but this is the first one in a while that really blew me away. I became interested in this book after reading a review stating the book was about a family that tries to raise a chimpanzee as a human family member. When I got the book, I thought I had the wrong book as the cover copy makes no mention of it. But I started reading anyway. By the time I realized I did have the right book, I was completely hooked. The narrator was such a fully drawn character, I wouldn't be surprised if she rang my doorbell one day.<br /><br />This book is impossible to put down, touching, and suspenseful. It also makes you think a lot about the nature of being human, the connection we have with animals, and the nature of our memories. How much of what we remember is real? How much can we ever really know another person (or chimp)? Who creates the \\"cages,\\" real or metaphorical, that trap us or protect us?<br /><br />This book drew me in to the point I felt I was watching it all unfold in front of my eyes in real life. I rarely give five-star reviews, but this is one book that deserves it. Unforgettable.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|This is one of those movies that not everybody will enjoy. The pace is different than most movies and so is the plot. It is, however, a lot of fun and somewhat thrilling experience in my opinion. Ryan Gosling steals the show, as does his cheesy racing jacket.
B00DU73T08|5.0|Excellent representation of the Stephanie Meyers novel (for adults even though the movie obviously tried to make it look like YA), All this, in spite of how difficult it is to represent internal dialogue in movie format. It was done as simply as possible and that is what makes it work for me.<br />Fascinating to create an antagonist who is in the same body as the protagonist at the beginning and trust that the audience will come to understand the many shades of gray (no pun intended!) that the story goes through.<br />Certainly not you average representation of alien life in American film.<br />Loved the complexity of the theme, and how thought provoking the concept is.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Wanted to see this since I love the Die Hard series. It's a good movie, exactly what you expect when you think of Die Hard movies.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Amazingly researched story..compelling and just could not put it down !<br />Ironic as I am traveling thru China now, and began the book after seeing it n the Xi An Airport..downloaded it<br />N became so hooked, I we t to visit all the landmark sights described in the book.  Most Beijinger's have NO<br />Idea what u are asking about when u say Fox Gate..now called &#34;Southeast Gate&#34;/ it is the only gate remaining along the old Peking city wall<br />And now houses a beautiful art gallery, the Red Door Gallery..it also has a floor dedicated to the history of the wall n gates w many old old photos.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I already knew quite a bit about Tesla. However, I enjoy the author's perspective in that Tesla is really not the focus of the work. The author uses Tesla's bigraphy as an inspirational example. I appreciated the nod to Gladwell's work w/re to human potential. I would recommend this book for high school students in particular because it dispels many of the myths about success. Further, I think that young adults who are preparing to enter the work force should learn the truth about how corrupt large corporations can be. I think everyone should know the truth/facts about Edison.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|How could I give thss app anything more than 1 star when it doesn't even launch on my device? A complete let down. Probably a scam to get my private information.
B005LAII80|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you're looking for a deep plot, this may not be your movie. The acting was great, however, and the action was intense. Even a lot of the 3D impressed me, and most movies don't do 3D well. If you're looking for a good summer action movie, this is a great choice.
0399213015|5.0|I gave these out as party favors at my son's 2nd birthday party and the guest loved them, they were so impressed with the quality and just how too cute these were.
B008220BP2|5.0|Saw this in the theater, absolutely loved this movie, and I wanted to get it for my home video collection.
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Love it. Great show, and great comedy!!! I'm a big Chevy Chase fan and he's funny in this. All the characters are fun and easy to understand.
B004IPPINW|4.0|Interesting perspective from a pakistani viewpoint on the gwot. Definitely recommend as a useful insight into how the US isperveived.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|My 14 year old son asked me to take him to see &#34;Despicable Me 2&#34; last week.  I had never seen the first movie, but I took him.  I enjoyed &#34;2&#34; so much that I decided to rent the original. Both movies are good, clean fun.  The minions are awesome!
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Very interesting and a book you don't want to put down!  It was like you were back in 1664 right  in the story.
0307744434|5.0|Such a great and magical book. It takes you away. Book was also in very nice shape, like brand new.
B00CFA227C|5.0|Enjoyed this movie - Loved the storytelling of it, and it was just enjoyable to watch. I thought it was very well done.
B005CRY2O6|4.0|The recipes I tried were good.  Some of the recipes had ingredients that I couldn't eat for health reasons, but it is an interesting cookbook and I do recommend it.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I love the diversity of this soundtrack.  The music is great for chilling/relaxing, background music for cooking or reading or just relaxing with friends.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was hard to believe what this family went through. Not to be a spoiler, I suggest you watch it and be amazed with<br />the human spirit and strength.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|You can not use the new update. It will freeze literally every time you get up there. I would not recommend updating it if you haven't all ready.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it is fun and never gets old I play it all the time I would recommend this game for everyone of all ages
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved this movie. This Blu-ray set is a must have for any Alien fans out there. The 3-D effects on this movie are phenomenal. It is the best 3-D effects i've seen in any movie so far. This Blu-ray set comes with a 3-D disc, a Blu-Ray disc, a DVD and a Digital copy disc, and a special features disc with about 7 hours of extras and behind the scenes features.  All in all this movie directed by Ridley Scott (director of the original  &#34;Alien&#34; movie)  revived my interest in the Alien movie franchise again, with the story going in a new direction, and great 3-D special effects.  I cant wait for Prometheus 2  already in the works.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story didn't grab me.  It seemed a little simplistic and the buildup was too slow for my tastes.  I didn't read the entire novel so take my review for what it is worth.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Feel good book that should be required reading in fourth grade.  Lessons taught are good for kids and adults alike.
B0007MAJBQ|4.0|This sender did an excellent job. I received it within a week from Japan!<br />Very good!<br />I love the minidiscs very much.<br />Thank you so much.<br />Wim van den Berg, Kissimme Fl.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love it<br />it makes you think<br />it takes some time to solve some of the levels<br />but its worth it
1401216676|5.0|Probably one of my favorite comics... i would reccomend this to people who are starting out or even pros... 5/5
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Pretty good movie. But not as good as the first one. Would watch it again.give it.a try worth the time for me anyway.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it once I started.  Compelling stories and character development.  No one is perfect and no one is pure evil, either.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My husband and I both loved watching this movie--it's very powerful, emotional, and has wonderful music.  Regardless of what people think about the individual actors, the story is timeless, and the music stirs the soul!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Like most people, I heard about Imagine Dragons because of the song &#34;Radioactive.&#34; I'm always wary to buy albums based off of one song, but I took a risk, and it paid off. I can't stop listening to this album and there isn't a single song that I don't enjoy. The more I listen to it, the more I can appreciate each track.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this book is having to wait for the third book to come out!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am not a \\"zombie person\\" - don't like the idea of them, the mental picture of them... ug! \\"No thank you!\\" But this book came HIGHLY recommended by a bunch of friends who know that about me, so I gave it a shot... and fell in hook, line & sinker! Really interesting look at humanity, psychology, cultural differences, environmental differences & similarities... The zombie part wasn't too bad,the human element was fascinating!
B0058W74UY|5.0|good app that I would easily reccomend to anyone in the whole entire world its so awesome that I have to write this stupid asa essay just to make it work. and its still apparently not going to work what the tuck is wrong with this piece of whit I should.have gotten an ipad
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This was just an okay movie, not as good as the others in this series.  Seemed to take a long time to get through.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The whole family gets into this music--even the kids (we screen some of the songs, because of the material in them), but it's nice to hear them singing these songs instead of some of the pop/rap garbage on the radio.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I watched the season of American Idol that Phillip Phillips won, and I remember thinking at the end that I couldn't wait for his album. I don't normally feel that way about contestants. Now that I've finally gotten around to buying it, I can see why I felt different: while he isn't exactly unique (because he does borrow a lot from DMB), he is a wonderful artist. This album is far from perfect, but it's a great first album with many good songs.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is a fun watch for a relaxing evening, or perhaps all day. It's brain candy. Highly enjoyable! Watched one after the next...addicting!<br />Great fun!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Great cd,back to the old qotsa.if i had a tail easily the best song on this disc.your money won't be wasted.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love it  anything Rod sings is wonderful have always been a big big big fan. Hes the best. Thank You
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I got this game for my son and we both love it!! easy enough for a 5 year old and fun enough for an adult!!
B004XWLN20|4.0|The packaging was the big problem.  I enjoyed watching the episodes, but I had to destroy the cardboard &#34;books&#34; to get the discs out without scratching them; I repackaged the discs in their own cases, which allows me me better access.  Nice to have the whole series, but the packaging is the big turn off.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|love the game just wish you didn't have to buy the extras, should be a way to send to friends or earn them.
B000065V3H|5.0|It's a good movie because the underdog comes out top...learns new moves...learns a good lesson...gets the girl...it's all good :)  Then again...I'm a sucker for the 80's Patrick Dempsey...
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is one of the best sea epics I have ever seen! There are great characters, an incredibly creative story, mellow music mostly played on violin, and much, much, much, much, much more! A definite must see for any movie lover like me!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Love this app! The only problem is I wish you could turn off the sound effects, but otherwise I love it!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Great romance movie. Fast moving and would not of guessed the ending. I really enjoy a great love story, this is my favorit for the year.
B00633W614|5.0|Jefferey Archer never disappoints the reader! This series is esp. enjoyable. I have read the 3 that are available and  look forward to the next installment.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|great for pre teens.  ok graphics. I'm glad I did not go to the theater and spend $12 to see this when it was first released like I was going to.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I have been a fan of Willie forever and this tops his last cd. Having his family and friends aboard on this cd just makes it better to have in your collection. All songs are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have family compititions with the game and she who had the highest score. Its so fun to play and if you don't like this game your crazy
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|this is horilble I don't even know what to do do not get this game it is horribly unfun I hats it so much. don't even get it don't bother getting this game no no no no
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I have used this app twice, and both times came away pretty impressed at what it can do.  I liked the results although the PDF looked a bit too black and white (grayscale may have done a better job), but overall it does what it says.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you look all over and think! I can't wait until they have new levels! I like it better on my Kindle than my phone.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I watch a lot of shows and this show is by far the best showI watch now. its jaw dropping and the mystery is superb. tatiana kills it!!! she def deserves an Emmy. No show compares to this and no show comes close to this. slowly the show is getting bigger since it first debuted. there are great shows out but this one grabs you and doesnt let it go.
B002POMLHY|5.0|Amazon did a deal on this album way back when it first came out and sold it for something like $2.99 for the whole album. Years later if I had to re-buy this album I'd be willing to pay $15!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|easy to use and I like the pictures. Has all the features I need. This is great for my brain exercise.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game for wasting time and really good to learn strategies and for a chre of boringness. I'd reccomend this to someone who likes strategy games 8)
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I love this game was so happy it came to mobile so I can play on my kindle fire. However you put an update on it in the last 24hrs now it has to reboot after every action I do. Please fix I was very happy with the way it was. If this problem didn't exists I'd give it 5 stars.
B0048EANOW|3.0|I love LA Confidential! Great film, great story, great look. I was excited for the Blu-ray but unfortunately I think my copy has a little glitch and froze a few times during viewing. I didn't get to watch the film until after the return policy expired and now have a coaster. My Bad!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Watched this with my adult children and grandchildren. We all enjoyed it and are looking forward to Despicable Me II.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|I expected a better movie, based on the history of academy nomination. It was way too long, and not very well edited. I feel I just wasted the money,
B0093SSYR6|5.0|I had never heard of Luke Kirby prior to this film. I think he is wonderful as the attractive neighbor who upsets the apple cart. Michelle Williams is her most capable and adorable self. Although not much attention is paid to Sarah Silverman's character,  she was a pleasant surprise to me. Seth Rogen plays a less peripatetic role in this. I feel this is where the film let's down a bit. Seth's character seemed to be under developed, and kind of one note. Totally enjoyed the story line and all performances. Especially liked the meetcute between Margo and Daniel. Brief, but full, nudity. This movie was  a surprise.  Sorry I missed it in theaters. Looking elsewhere for Mr. Luke Kirby. Hasn't done much. Hope more  directors discover this heavenly gem of an actor.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I love the movie and it got me to get the books and i never did that before, i always read the book before the movie but the cover of the book never got my attention. cant wait to start reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Temple Run but this game is definitely engaging and addicting. Best free game ever!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is th e best game ever 101 games in one game there's mostliy one game in one game get this game its. the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Creepy in almost every way how our food is processed.  This is a film that MUST be watched to really understand what goes with our food!~
0062014536|2.0|As much as I enjoyed reading the first two books, this one I didn't even finish.  Tired of the love triangle.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I am glad I purchased the special edition because as a fan I wanted to hear more of his work. This album has the same feel as the Batman Begins soundtrack which is one of my all time favorites. The artwork and steel book presentation were fantastic. Great music to go with a great movie.
B007EE564U|4.0|In the line of the other Vince Flynn novels, The Last Man does not disappoint.<br /><br />Good action with some pretty 'nasty' action.<br /><br />Good read.
1577314808|5.0|I am a life coach and passionate self-developer. I am deeply impressed, Eckhart Tolle is answering so many questions I  was just about to ask (and many more!). His answers are simple, understandable and feel fantastically true. I received immensely valuable wisdom and – very important for me – simple and practical guidance as how to implement it into my everyday life. The moment I follow Eckhart Tolle's advice, I instantly feel better. Always. The wisdom in this book has great potential and has become a major stepping stone on my journey. Thank you Eckhart Tolle!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|epic production  cast and settings fantastic  a must see for all period piece lovers  the drama and the overall setting is from a time long gone
0062014536|4.0|First I have to say that I loved this series.  While the 3 books expand over a year in time, it does feel like much longer than that.  The characters and Society itself evolves drastically in that time, and we experience the loss of Utopia, in exchange for the freedom to choose.  That is the thing about this storyline, it is a constant inside struggle in Lena as it is any person with her situation.  Would it have been better to remain as I was and avoid the pain in fighting for what I know is right? The book was very engaging and I think it was a proper last one, in that there is no certain happy ending.  That I think its the point here, they now have a right to choose, freedom and with that not necessarily a happy ending but the right to choose their own.  The ending, I think was disappointing for those who expected a clear resolution to the love triangle, but that I don't think would of been fair to Lena, Julian, and Alex.  Both Alex and Julian sacrifice so much for Lena, but in the end that's not what matters.  The series, is about love, but mostly the right to chose who we love.  As always, it is very well written and I encourage anyone who reads the series or begins to (now that we have the final one) read them in all in a row, as alot happens in each one.  Great job by the author.  Will read in the future.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised with this series. I love the Emma movie with Gwyneth Paltrow, but I really feel that this actress portrayed the book version of Emma even more so. Couldn't get enough!
0062255657|5.0|Classic Gaiman. Amazing ability to represent fantasy in a way that everyone can enjoy and understand. Beautiful writer. This novel felt more personal than American Gods, Anansi Boys, Good Omens, etc.
B00B9HTK1S|5.0|It's just like the new movies that recently came out.It was rather funny and full of mystery,action,and suspense.Well not really suspenseful.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Fun but really needs more levels. Also, crowns should be introduced in the beginning, but I guess that adds replay value?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this free app allows you to download many modern versions of the Bible (NKJV, HCSV, ESV, NET, etc) for offline reading. the interface is really easy to use... when you are online it has many more Bible translations and it has audio Bible reading capabilities for many of the translations.  The NET version of the bible also includes their 60000+ textual translation notes for offline reading.  FOR FREE!!
B00005JNS0|3.0|Another overpriced, under produced feel good movie of the year.  My kid has watched it almost a thousand times.  But it was way too expensive.
B00D8OHPF8|2.0|Not really all That the songs on the album too me it's  not hot Joe could do better then that.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|I saw the new Man of Steel then rented this one from Amazon. The new Superman movie was too heavily weighted with battles between Superman and General Zod. They threw each other through countless skyscrapers.  This one has more balance. I like Amy Adams but Margo Kidder's Lois and Christoper Reeve's Clark Kent are hard to beat.  They are downright cute.  The new General Zod is better -- a more sophisticated bad guy.  If you have never seen the original Superman story, this one is the one you should rent.  The stories are essentially the same.
B00797MB0O|4.0|There are people out there like this.  Theron does good job portraying the ego of someone who has always had the easy way out and now is past her prime.  Good reality check.
0979019710|5.0|I love the enthusiasm of the author and the very practical steps he gives to help you acquire some great habits.  I ended up getting both the video and audio version and buying an extra copy for my sister.  It's a simple, but powerful idea and a routine - which is just what I was looking for.
B007SGM084|5.0|i am enjoying reading this book. this is easy summer reading. i am glad i purchased it. what to read next when it is done.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I enjoyed watching this.  However it was much different than I expected of a 'Star Trek' show.  The humans though intelligent and dedicated use even more 'cowboy' diplomacy than even James T Kirk.  They succeed despite themselves in some occasions and brilliantly in other situations.  The show makes Vulcan's appear to be closer to their emotions than the other series and other aliens seem a bit aloof in the beginning but are won over by the humans in time.<br /><br />Two very charming aspects of the series is Dr. Phlox and the Captain's dog Porthos.  The doctor has a merry disposition and is different than your typical 'alien'.  The methods he uses to treat the crew are both unusual and reasonable.  In a way it would be like a medieval herbalist in the future.<br /><br />Scott Bakula plays Captain Archer a man in great need to succeed.  He has a bias against Vulcans whom he feels have been holding humanity back and thus did a disservice to his father (one of the scientists who developed space travel technology.  I loved Mr. Bakula in other shows and know him to be a great actor.  This role however was not ideal for him as he comes across as a gentle person even when angry.  I do not mistake gentle for weak in this, but he did not always seem as forceful as he should.<br /><br />One very detracting aspect of the show was the costuming for the Vulcan Science Officer.  While the rest of the crew wore loose fit uniforms, she was wearing very snug outfits.  No other Vulcan was portrayed in this manner and it seemed a disservice to the actress to have her thus attired.<br /><br />The show starts rather slow but picks up momentum with each episode. I would watch it again, but not as often as I would Voyager or ST:TNG.<br /><br />Enjoy the show but do not put too many preconceptions into play when you do.
B0000E64TQ|5.0|This is Elton John in the closet (likely wouldn't sing &#34;All the Young Girls Love Alice&#34; today) and before the schmaltz. The detail in the SACD surround mix is incredible.  It's like hearing the album for the first time. Highly Recommended.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This was enjoyable.  Predictable plot but with some surprises too.  The writing was engaging and the main character likeable and believable.  From a simple start the characters and plot unfolded and I enjoyed the trip the whole way along.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I really wanted to love this as much as I loved &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and &#34;The Kite Runner.&#34; I will grant that the writing is beautiful and that Hosseini has a way of stringing words together in a way that is unpredictable yet, once read, so perfect and obvious. As I read his writing, I think, of course it has to be described that way. How else could an image be so perfectly conjured? However, there was just something about this book that kept me at a distance, unlike his other stories which completely engulfed me. Part of it has to do with the multitude of characters. While I understand the merit of each character as necessary parts of the whole, I think that some of the characters in the periphery were given too big a role while taking attention away from the more important characters. Just when I felt like I was beginning to truly identify with the character, the perspective would change and I would lose the connection. Perhaps it was just too much for my ADD mind, which has a hard time focusing as it is.<br /><br />Because I recognize the quality of writing with this novel, it was difficult to give it a rating any higher than I did (though I wavered between 3 and 4 stars. Ultimately, my decision was made by the words that pop up when I hover over the star. &#34;I liked it&#34; was just much more appropriate than &#34;I really liked it&#34;). Being a fan of Khaled Hosseini's, I'm glad I read this, but it was not my favorite of his
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers Of Catan is legendary among gamers, but the mass market really doesn't know much about it.  It is easily one of the best games ever made.  I recommend getting the base game, and the 5-6 player expansion.<br /><br />To a newcomer, the game can look somewhat daunting; the many tiles, pieces, and cards make Catan seem more complex than it really is.  I've never seen anyone play this game and not like it, and that includes some rather austere individuals indeed.  It's intuitive enough for almost anyone to understand, and will improve strategic thinking skills, especially when played in larger groups.
B009EELBIS|5.0|I have shared this movie with my children and now with our grandchild (and nephews/nieces).  The kids love the music and always have lots of questions which I use as  history lessons.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I was having issues with the old app. so I updated to the new one please put the old one back on because since I updated I can not read any of my books. The update will not work it keeps rebooting back to start and will not load my books if ya'll can not fix this app. I want ALL MY BOOKS REFUNDED AND I WANT ALL MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's just like playing at home with friends. I love this game but I don't have some one that plays it like I do so this is great
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn does it again. After reading &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; I wanted more of this author. It's difficult to compare the two novels because they are both quite different in plot, but I would say &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; is almost as good as &#34;Gone Girl.&#34; This novel touches more on the psychological affects of striving for, and failing to receive, a mother's love. She touches on the anguish of the protagonist at having to revisit her hometown to investigate a murder. What I liked about &#34;Gone Girl&#34; was its unpredictability, and &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; is just as twisted.
B002T66IHC|5.0|this product was exactly what i needed it to be.  It came to be very useful, thanks for the product.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This is an amazing albun. For more than 30 years they still keep that electric style mixed with romantic and powerful lirics.. Loved again and again job well done!!
0679805273|5.0|This is a great gift for children who are just beginning their educational journey. I suggest having your all of you child's teachers write a message to your child at the close of each year as a type of keepsake.
0062235893|1.0|The book itself is very cute, but I expected the entire story. Nowhere in the product description did it mention this was an abbreviated version of the story.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was an ok read.  If  you're on vacation and have read everything else you brought with you, this book is ok to pass the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is always my favorite game.Definitely worth the money.Play it as much as my mom will let me.<br />Love it
B00129H7VS|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|.Excellent series. Kevin Spacey and the whole cast are fantastic. If you love all the dirty back stabbing political activities then this is for you.  The plots are so convoluted you almost have to watch twice to follow all the  different scenarios.  The political intrigue only<br />wets my appetite for more. Can't wait for season 2.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|It is a classic - the graphic is excellent and multi-lingual feature is great.  Must have for Final Fantasy fans!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is the most versatile car charger made!  Works flawlessly on long trips.  If you own Android and Apple devices, this is for you!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This thing is plenty big for multiple kids or adults to play in though once you get over a certain size, probably 30-40lbs the slide becomes useless. My 14 month hold loved it and had no issue getting into the smaller portion and down the slide. Would recommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />The only piece that leaked was where the hose attached for the water spouts after a few hours of use. We probably had too much pressure on it during play time or it got kicked and gave way a little.<br /><br />Here are some images since it amazon will not let me load any. [...]
B000ICXQHE|4.0|It was a little corny but intertaining lots of good actors. Lots of action and a nice twist at the end
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I really love this app. I had Astrid before this & it was a good app but this one is ten times better. You get to set the background pic of your inbox, there is an additional note pad area for extra note-taking, & you can set reminders for specific tasks. I used this app for everything. The main aspect I love the most is Wunderlist's customer service. You can chat or email & speak with a Rep to answer any questions you may have. I absolutely recommend this app for students, busy moms, & business types.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just caught up on all three seasons because I wanted to know what the fuss was all about. And now I know...
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this Movie pure and simple.  Can't hardly think of any more to say, except that it is a good movie with food for thought and good moral values.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|it is a cute and fun game but it runs so slow on my kindle that it is hard to play.
1781162646|5.0|This was such a great book! I struggled to put it down between chapters. I love the carnival theme of it; I never read anything like this and I really enjoyed it. I felt really close to the characters, speaking their lingo, feeling their frustration, fear, and curiosity.<br />I don't usually like to read books about dying people (let alone children) however I didn't feel very sad while reading it. The parts in the book with the dying boy, Mike, were very happy and would make me smile. Stephen King did an excellent job developing Mike's personality and making him an inspiring and lovable character. King also created insane suspense with plot twists that made me frantically read it to find out what happens next.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was amazing, i only wish it would elaborate more on what was to happen at the end
B00915G6YE|5.0|I was a little worried about how they started the season, but it came back around to Dexter being more in character.
038572179X|3.0|Surely one of the most extended(?) cases of coitus interruptus in fiction.  No other reason to read the book.  OK, the hysterical 13-year-old is well done
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love Sookie, and all her friends and lovers. It was a great read, but I'm glad it's over. The ending was pretty predictable but the book pretty much ties everything together so you're not left hanging. Worth Buying!
B0060CXN2O|5.0|I've watched this movie about 100 times and love it every time.  I lost it for a little while and was so sad until I finally found it again
B008GVD6D8|3.0|long gone are the memories of Christian Grey and Gideon Cross seems to grow a little more appealing in this one which kept me reading to the end and looking forward to 3rd book
B00003CXAA|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer created a timeless epic, free from all trappings of corny Americana, yet infusing it with a timeless feel of moral and rural values, alien worlds and society ethics, thus making SUPERMAN a global hero to look up to and at the same time, avoiding the dreaded dated fate of such music for generations to come.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This equalizer app is awesome! It brings out the loudness and bass in my music on my kindle fire.I recommend this equalizer app to everyone,it is awesome!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The action never stops.  Lots of parts of this show are very funny, while others are very gruesome.  I especially like the action, the steamy scenes and what can be better than drug and gun running?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My six-year-old daughter loves this game. She says, &quot;It's great!&quot;  In fact, she would give it 1,800 stars ... if she could!
B0090KZDSK|3.0|which is surprising after 3 books - no big surprise in the end - not bad follow up on other 2
B00005N5S2|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|STID follows up the 2009 instalment with gusto, flare and dramatic action, despite that most of the themes are carried over from the previous film. Another lovingly familiar aspect is the arrangement of the ENTERPRISE motif in major, against the frantic minor ostinatos for the JOHN HARRISON character, carried over from a much beloved instalment of the '80s series, thus giving musical clues for the real identity of the films villain!
B003YBUSMW|4.0|i use this almost ever day and i love it :) except it has disconnected 3 times during the middle of my game :( but it works more often then not
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I hope the bad guys don't win, that is why I still keep watching.  This show is addicting and more than creepy!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Wish the demo was a bit longer tho, and I did have some issues downloading the full version. But great graphics and story line.
B00866H7SS|3.0|having just finished 50 Shades, I found this book a total rip off right down to toothbrush scene and falling in his office - couldn't be any more copied if she tried - Gideon Cross v Christian Grey, not a patch and a lot more vulgar. Cant say I would have been interested in reading next one had I not left a large gap in between
B001F3DY9A|5.0|this product was exactly what i needed it to be.  It came to be very useful, thanks for the product.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Smart movie Smart parents buy for smart kids! Thats really all you need to know about this one. its a total classicv for all time through and through just like EVERYTHING Ronald Dahl has ever written.<br /><br />The Charlie and the Choclate factory guy wrote this one and Danny DeVito Produced and stars in it as the horrible stupid father figure.<br /><br />Wish this was around when i was coming up, because it perfectly describes my childhood of being a extra extraordinary child with a hunger for learning surrounded by idiots who never had a clue and were never able to recognize who i really was.<br /><br />Lucky for Matilda she finds a few smart friends and one smart teacher, instead of just being surrounded by 100% morons to this day like I still am!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Haven't finished it but so far very good!  I have read his other books and loved them, I am hoping this story is just as intriguing.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Thus is a great game. A game the whole family will enjoy. Thank you for whoever thought of it.  The comintary for it is awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a fun game but there is in app purchasing so be careful. I gave it a four because I think Subway Surfers Paris is a little better. Graphics are nice. It runs slow the first the first time you play it but it speeds up the next time you open the app. Still it's a fun way to connect with friends to see who can get the highest score.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was the only one on our family that did NOT read the book first. Nevertheless, we all enjoyed the movie a great deal.  My son can't wait until the release of the second in the series.  From what I understand there were only a few minor changes throughout the movie that weren't really big plot points anyway.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I liked this video.  I enjoyed the content and like the way it was put together.  I will watch it again.
0767836324|4.0|Fun story for kids and adults will find it cleaver too in the 'How Peter Pan Got His Crow Back&#34; kind of way.<br /><br />Kinda a mid life crisis film for the Lost boy that went Corporate Raider sold out workaholic on young kids of his own.<br /><br />The only thing i regret about this pone is pairing a brilliant Stage and Screen Classically Trained Actor like Dustin Hoffman against this chuckle head crass comedian known as Robin Williams. Truley a low point for Dustin even though he seems to shine through as one oh-so-real villain you just cant help but love the whole way through.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman definitely gave a stellar performance worth seeing in spite of the clownshoe he had to play across.<br /><br />DUSTIN HOFFMAN IS THE BOMB!
0812983459|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce was thought-provoking and inspiring in many ways. The reader had to suspend reality and allow for the premise that a 65 year old retired man, who went to mail a letter to a dying friend could change course and walk across England, without any preparation or hiking experience, in the hopes that his efforts would be the impetus for saving a friend he had not seen in twenty years. Honestly, I didn't think I would be able to do it, but as this was a book club selection, I gave it a try. I am glad that I did.<br /><br />The novel made me stop and think. Harold Fry, an ordinary gentleman, accomplished the extraordinary, in the name of friendship, and in the process reflected upon his own life. The effects of his good intentions rippled outward and touched many throughout his journey, and the stories of those he met along the way impacted Harold Fry.<br /><br />This is not an action-packed story. The narrative developed slowly, and the characters grew on this reader over time.  But, I was very much drawn to the story and I was rooting for Harold Fry throughout. If only we all would have the courage to step out of our everyday lives to attempt the amazing, the unlikely, or the improbable for the purpose of helping another.<br /><br />My only real complaint about the story was that it was a bit melancholy, and the ending, though realistic, not as satisfying as I was expecting. Consider it for a book club discussion.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Huge Jack Reacher fan. Great book as per usual. I don't ask for much in books. As long as it keeps me enticed I really don't care about the writing style or &#34;hidden meanings&#34;. Would strongly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It has in app purchasing so be careful how you click. But all in all it has pretty good graphics. And the replay value is great for a free game. I'm pretty  sure I've wasted several hours playing it and I've only had it a few days.  Pro tip, be sure to do the daily challenges and the missions and watch your score skyrocket.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great show! i ant wait for season 3 tomorrow on usa at 10 pm. kept me very entertained! brilliant show
0307744434|5.0|I had been hoping to read a book so compelling. I was mesmerized with the story from the first sentence. Brava!
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|If you want the most Watchman you can possibly get this is the set to get!<br /><br />It is the fullest most complete version of the film and really adds layers to the story about what makes a Hero and what makes a Villain and how the line between the two, is hard to find.<br /><br />And the additional comic book animated into a 3-4 hour straight from the book cartoon is a good way to get into the source material even if it looks kinda silly sometimes. Its an even vaster story with all the super nerd details you might be looking for.<br /><br />The only thing that i say needs help is the damn commentary track. There is only the Director Commentary with Zack S. and he might be a great director but to be honest he sounds like some young kid who is totally unsure of himself, stumbling through sentences and chattering aimlessly about one thing or another giving no real insight into the material whatsoever.<br /><br />Unless you like listening to what sounds like some awkward highschool kid going 'Like' and 'Umm' a thousand times in 3 hours dont bother getting this one for the commentary.<br /><br />Which was a damn shame to me because i like a good commentary.... Maybe one day they will make one.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a delightfully dark fantasy of childhood horror. The writing moved me with it's melancholy and innocence. Neil Gaiman is an imaginative hero.
B0053FANQS|5.0|The first movie of fast and furious, you can watch it and you'll never bored, buy it now! and if you didn't see this film, watch it now!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I gave it a four star. It would have gotten a five if there was a live radar map but there isn't.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Okay, I was geeking out before even saw the movie. I've seen the movie twice, and this track is wholely original.and like the movie itself, it's a fusion of different genres woven together.but more than that, it's just awesome kick ass motivational music. It's sort of hard rock/metal, techno, jazz and it even has a classical music throwback in there.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Take this brief review for what its worth. There's a whole sub-culture around Tarantino admiration, which I have always thought was meant to justify enjoying gratuitous violence by referring to its portrayer as, \\"brilliant\\". In reality, this, like most other Tarantino blood-candy, \\"Django\\" is a gushing violence-fest with a \\"I'm a badass, watch me kill s***\\" plotline and plenty of the usual screaming, raping, and castrating, that are staples of this genre. If the movie has any redeeming quality, it is in some top-notch acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is utterly believable as he is hate-worthy, and Christoph Waltz who steals every scene he is in.<br /><br />Give this movie a pass, and go bake a cookie - your IQ will remain intact, and it will be more satisfying in the long run.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Death, sorrow, and struggle. These are the three main components of Dead Man Down; a film that revolves around the death of a man's family, the sorrow he feels because of it, and the struggle he must go through to get his revenge. While maybe not the most creative premise I've seen recently, Dead Man Down works because it's focused. A lot of films seem to deviate from the main plot in an effort to create something more well-rounded, but this usually ends up with the movie being a disaster. Dead Man Down, on the other hand, picks a lane and sticks to it. It wants you to feel for the two leads and, by the end of it, you probably will.<br /><br />You follow the story of Victor (Colin Farrell) and, later, Beatrice (Noomi Rapace). Victor's family was murdered a few years ago by some Albanians hired by a man named Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard). Because they believed him to be dead, Victor was able to infiltrate Alphonse's gang in an effort to get close to him. He wants his revenge on not only Alphonse, but the Albanians as well. Beatrice lives in the apartment complex across the street from him. After witnessing him kill a man, Beatrice blackmails Victor because she wants him to kill someone for her - a man who was driving under the influence and crashed into her, leaving her face ruined.<br /><br />While I do feel that Beatrice wasn't exactly essential to the story, her presence doesn't really derail the movie in any way. In fact, some of the writing that involved both Victor and Beatrice was actually very clever. However, she was also the reason for one of Dead Man Down's biggest flaws, the way it ended. You see, while Beatrice and Victor make an enjoyable team, I don't think sacrificing a strong ending for the inclusion of a female lead was a good move. There's a point in the movie where all of Victor's plans are going according to plan and had they ended it right then and there the ending would have been more impactful.<br /><br />Instead, they took the generic route and had a huge firefight while Victor attempts to save the damsel in distress. Now, this is the same issue I had with Jack Reacher a few months back. You had an action-thriller that went against the grain and provided some intelligent writing, but they ruined it by having your run-of-the-mill ending. While Dead Man Down's previous moments aren't as great as Jack Reacher's, the same concept applies. It's obvious that they chose to end the film the way they did because the writer felt like it had to end that way given the genre. Unfortunately, the ending just didn't do it for me and it kind of ruined everything that preceded it.<br /><br />Other than that, though, Dead Man Down was surprisingly enjoyable. I had pretty low expectations based on the trailer, but I enjoy Colin Farrell so I figured I would give it a shot. It's raw and gritty while at the same time feeling honest and humane. Both Victor and Beatrice are going through some hard times and they're ultimately there to help each other through them. It starts as a man and a woman wanting revenge, but ends with two people realizing that they're not necessarily the only people going through a hard time. Also, the film has some pretty excellent pacing and a few comedic moments that help balance everything out.<br /><br />Overall I felt the casting was very well done. Colin Farrell, in particular, did a great job as Victor. His ability to bring out this character's struggle through mere facial expressions was outstanding and it seemed as if you could actually see the pain in his eyes. Rapace's performance was spot on as well. Both of these actors were playing some tough roles, but they both did an excellent job. Also, Terrence Howard constantly seems to be improving his skill as an actor. In the past I've always felt his performances were a little shaky, but he seems more confident and comfortable and it shows in his performance as Alphonse.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - While I don't think Dead Man Down would have been the greatest film ever made even with the proper ending, it wouldn't have hurt to try. Everything leading up to its closing moments was really solid and the story kept me engaged the entire time, but the ending just felt extremely out of place given the emotional context of the film. Still, it's an enjoyable experience and one I would recommend if you were looking to check it out.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I downloaded this game and it froze right away. once I fixed it and got it to load I played it nonstop. but once I got to the part in the game where you had fight vector it stopped again. I love these minions but the amount of freezing in this game is crazy. rather than the freezing this game is better than other running games such as temple run subway suffers and angry Gran run. just. I need it to stop freezing on my kindle fire. or else ill have to go back to games like pet hotel resteraunt story and style me girl. plllzzzzzz fix
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Excellent in every way, action and comedy, a great ingredient, Die Hard was always and as always, will be entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a free app. For a calculator on my tablet, and it works! So yeah, it's a good thing to have.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Way Cool! Family movie.. Very creative and cute.. Love the minions! It was nice to see Gru finally came around to being a father to the kids.
B001RLP862|2.0|Would be more prestigious if they were produced in the USA!<br />Instead more Chinese crap. Get the Cartamundi's or spend the<br />extra money on the Kems. You'll be happy you did!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Like that I can name alarms, set many alarms, have alarm start soft and increase in volume, and various tones.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is a great app crashes on my tab once Ive been a while but otherwise no problems! And inapropriate ads too
B000TFINY6|5.0|Excellent story and others, you should see it or if you've already seen, a great collection for you, buy now!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's an okay game but it's free so I can't really complain. However the instructions suck and it took me a minute to figure  out how to play. Graphics could be a little sharper and a little less fuzzy. But still a semi-run way to pass the time. I don't know how much replay value it has after you've beaten it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great way to work your brain. Each level is more challenging than the last. I recommend to excersice your mind.
0807014265|5.0|How this man was able to write such a good book in such a short time is incredible.<br /><br />To remain rational at such a horrible time and to tell this story without judgement or rancor is impossible, yet?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow. This game is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The updates may be slow....<br />It may not be like Xbox or PC but it rocks.please like this .<br />P.S. I'm 9 and really like it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I steadfastly assert that Tempest is one of Bob's greatest, most moving, and beautiful albums ever. I cry every time.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Excellent story and others, you should see it or if you've already seen, a great collection for you, buy now!
B0088P2A7A|4.0|It's cool I use Wikipedia all the time so it's cool to have an app for it right at hand. It got a four because I prefer the look of the webpage layout to that of the app. But it works great so it's not a bog deal.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is great and all but it takes a while to load in between runs. If they would fix that i would give it 5 stars...but its still amazingly fun
1591844096|5.0|I payed $13.72 for this book but just like any other piece of art it can never be adequately paid for. Seth Godin continues to lead by example.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Life has so many secrets. Good or bad, secrets shock the soul. I loved reading this book and the good secrets they revealed.
0792844890|5.0|Bottomline, if you don't think Spaceballs is funny, I would think there is something wrong with your sense of humor. So many great lines from this movie. I watch it frequently. May the Schwartz be with you!!!!
B000I8G5B2|5.0|If you are expecting robots, space aliens, or any other trappings of your typical sci-fi movie, then skip this. If you are willing to watch a contemporary look into eugenics and the science of messing with our genes to perfect the human race....then boy are you in for a wild ride. This character-driven piece about a young man born as nature intended living in a world with people who have been engineered by science is simply amazing. It's warnings against tampering with the ability of nature to perfect humans without human help is something to think about. The futuristic settings and environment were a believable addition to the plot. I couldn't stop looking at Uma Thurman's gorgeous lips in every scene she was in, and the youthful, handsomeness of the leading men made the movie a delicious tale of what can go wrong when we allow science to manipulate us into seeming perfection.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is awful. Do not waste your time downloading it . The thing doesn't even work it just freezes every time you try to watch a video. And it says vTube has incurred a problem and the application has closed. Useless app just go to YouTube on your web browser it works great... DO NOT!!! Download this app!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a five star app before the update. It was easy to read, easy to navigate, and had all the information I wanted. The update is difficult to read (who thought of using a white font against a tree budding with pale pink and white flowers - you CAN'T read the words), you have to go through extra steps to get your info, and it's much too busy looking. I'm uninstalling.
