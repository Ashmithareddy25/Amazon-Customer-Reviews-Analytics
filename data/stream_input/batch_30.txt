B00EMXBDMA|5|Combine a nerdy geeky story with our human survival instinct, so deep in our universal subconscious: that’s The Martian, a very smart science fiction novel with intolerable suspense. The best of its kind.<br /><br />I had not read a science fiction novel for a while, and what a pleasure to get back to it with that gem! The Martian is unique: it is at the edge of the possible actually, and full of fascinating details on what a human mission on Mars could look like, and what can happen when all hell breaks loose…<br /><br />It will put things in perspective if I tell you first that the author was hired as a computer programmer for a national lab when he was fifteen. His novel is full of scientific facts, related to astronomy, physics, biology, maths, chemistry, computer sciences, etc.,  and they seem to be all pretty much accurate. In fact, he even wrote his own software to track constant-thrust trajectories to insert accurate data in the story!<br /><br />So Andy Weir came up with the plot as he was trying to imagine all the details to prepare a human mission on Mars.<br />A team of six arrives there for the first time, under the commands of a woman by the way.<br />Because of a big storm (they are quite nasty up there), they decide to get back in their ship and leave. But Mark Watney does not make it. Unable to find him, the rest of the crew decides to leave anyway, thinking he was killed. But he was just wounded and ends up the only creature there, like a 21st century Robinson Crusoe. He does not have enough food to survive until the next scheduled mission, and the living conditions are closer to hell than Eden. Remember, there’s no water on Mars, nothing grows, and it does not have our Earth air. Even though this guy is super creative and knows how to put to good use all his knowledge in botany and physics, will it be enough for him to survive? You won’t know one way or the other until you read the book to the very end.<br /><br /> Anything can turn against him to the very last minute. That made the suspense quite unbearable! It was even increased for me when his daily log, written in the first person, written i the first person, smartly switched from time to time to third person narrator. Each time I told myself, this is it, he’s done.<br />The pressure is relieved by super funny dialogs, or monologs, as well as hilarious details on our culture as he tries to relax with a few books, music and TV shows saved on flash-drives.<br /><br />There are A LOT of technical details, absolutely fascinating stuff. Wow, the author did think this whole thing through for sure!<br />The setting varies between Mars and the agency in the US, as well as another country, I won’t say more. This interaction, as well as the pressure from the medias, also made for extra layers of interest.<br /><br />At a deeper human level, the book also offers an interesting reflection on the themes of death and solitude: will the inability of communicating with Earth simply drive him insane and kill him? How would you deal with the possibility of dying alone on a far away planet with no humans around you?t him to the very last minute. That made the suspense quite unbearable!

B00CWY76CC|5|so fun! recommend to everyone!  the puzzles and patterns really make you think. can you escape is fun to play with a friend too.
B008Y720JU|5|Great film about life, friends, love and what's important!
B00000K19E|3|The hype about this film is unwarranted.   True, there are some excellent special effects - realistic ones, but many are too false eg gunfight in hall with pillars when gunfire too easily splinters junks of concrete and  it falls like polystyrene - as it is.   The storyline is somewhat boring,  and I fell asleep during twice trying to view the whole film;  the third  occasion I managed to stay the course but only by fast-forwarding the  chunks of dialogue which apart from being boring were also too far-fetched  to be believable.   In all the film was much like the Curates egg - a mixed  bag - some good some bad.   I am in my 60s and have viewed many hundreds of  films and, generally, I agree the average viewing star-rating.   This time  I did not.
0201626632|5|When I bought Feibelman's book, I was in my 3rd postdoc fellowship and worried that I'd never find a decent job in physics. I read the book and within a short time I landed a tenure-track position, obtained substantial grant funding, and started a thriving research program. The advice in the book helped me figure out how to present myself as a job candidate, how to negotiate a job offer, and how to write a compelling grant proposal. <br />If this review sounds to you like an ad for a miracle diet pill, you're right. The advice in the book really worked for me, and I recommend it highly to anyone planning a career in science.
B001P829VY|5|This review is for the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Treasure of the Sierra Madre is excellent.  Details are crisp, and the contrast is strong.  There are about half a dozen moments scattered throughout the film where the quality goes bad, looking like an unconverted DVD.  But these only last for a few seconds each.  Apparently, they did not have good source material for those few scenes.  Otherwise, I was quite pleased.  The sound is okay, but not great.  Dialogue is fine, but the soundtrack hisses a bit, and the punches in a couple of fight scenes sound very weak.  Apart from these quibbles, this version is well worth owning.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B00BAXFJ5M|4|This is one of<br />Baldacci's best.  Very interesting and will hold your interest from start to finish.  Great plot and good ending.
B001GCUO1Q|4|Growing up I watched the X-men cartoon every week and loved two of the characters: Wolverine and Gambit.  In this movie, you get to see both!  The story of Wolverine may not be as fast-paced as some would like, but it does go into how he became the way he did and how a rift developed between him and his brother.  Gambit's appearance is a bonus and I hope we get to see more of him in the future since his character and humor deserved to be seen.    Some may be disappointed on the set up for the next movie about Ryan Reynolds' character Wade Wilson, but overall it's an enjoyable movie for those wishing to escape into the world of mutants.
B0000067L2|5|Strange no one else has reviewed this. I love this album. Its one of the bluesiest almbums ever, but its also one of the heaviest, most driving records ever recorded as well. All the songs are pretty to really good, but in my opinion only Take it Back and the immortal Sunshine on Your Love are great. Blue Condition and Strange Brew are almost great. That's why I'd give it a 4.5 - the music is infinitely close to greatness, but just not close enough. But, because of it's legendary status and being possibly the first hard rock album, I'll give it the amazon.com 5
B0047Y0FGY|3|This book started off good, and then petered out for me. Tina Fey doesn't really have a lot to say.
0143125842|5|This book was brilliant. I loved it as I loved The Lacuna by Kingsolver. Pulitzer! What else can I say.
B00008PW2D|1|Like everybody else, I enjoy the show. I went ahead and bought seasons 2-4.  But I saw 2 season 5 episodes (or 1 whole 3rd of the entire season for you math students out there) and they were the worst episodes of Sex and the City I've ever seen.  I still would have considered dropping $15 on a 2 disc set just to catch up on the story lines, but $32 (ON SALE) or $4 per sub-par episode? You've gotta be kidding me! if I have money to burn I MIGHT pay $4 to rent the whole thing from my video store, but that's about it.  Here's what I'd like to see with Season 6: A 3-4 disc DVD collection that's actually worth the *$30-$40* price tag because A. the discs are packaged in something other than cheap plastic that completely falls apart the third time you open it, and B. it actually has \\"extras\\" on the discs that you couldn't get anywhere else.  And when I say \\"extras\\", I mean something more than 4 episode commentaries by the always enthralling Michael Patrick King.  For example, the latest Simpsons DVD had more discs than any SATC release and commentary by Matt Groening, writers, directors and at least 2 cast members on EVERY EPISODE, and I STILL paid less for it than my SATC dvds.  I'm sure they could also find outtakes, gag reels, and other material that would be of interest to us fans to include.  I think even the most loyal fan should avoid buying this set and encouraging HBO to continue this ignorant brand of customer service.
B002JWD6AS|3|I loved the way this story was written. From a technical perspective, Stiefvater told the story beautifully. The way she delivers information is gorgeous and I love how she tackled a teen-sex scene. It's how all sex scenes should be told (leave it to my imagination).<br /><br />The problem with this book is that there's very little story here. It's just a love story and it's one that doesn't feel realistic because it's love-at-first-bite and I don't believe in love-at-first-sight which leads me back to the sex scene because Grace basically hops in bed with a boy she knows intuitively. Real love is based on actually knowing someone, not staring into their eyes (if you're staring into the other person's eyes more than you talk with the other person, you're not doing the couple-thing right).<br /><br />I'm going to read the second book because Stiefvater is a series-writer and I'm hoping there's a plot here that I didn't catch because I was in awe of the story-telling. Stiefvater can write but I wish she'd give me something with more substance, something with meat clinging to the bones.

B00A8ECU24|5|I love this so cool game that every day I get up early for the MY LITTLE PONY GAME. You have too go and get this cool app. (HIT go get this cool app for your little girl)
B00AKKTDJY|1|I was very excited to get the app, and when I first got it all the restaurants were unlocked, but after I updated it, half of the restaurants became locked. If a company is going to charge an additional $5.94 to get the whole game after spending an initial $0.99 to buy a game, then I feel like they are not a trustworthy company. The game itself was fun, but they really need to be upfront about the true cost of the whole game, not just part of it.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|I enjoy the graphics and story line. The rooms are fun to explore and at times challenging but the cost to achieve what's needed seems a bit much.
B00L9B7IKE|2|Major disappointment after the advertising blurbs. Too long for the story, too much non-essential wording - just got boring before the end.
0385342055|2|Dear Ms. Wickham (aka Kinsella),    Becky's shopping problem was a great fatal for Becky's character, but I am really disappointed to see that Becky's character has not evolved as real humans do.  I had hoped that mini-shopaholic would have been more about her transformation into a flawed but maturing mother, but instead both you and Becky treat the child as an accessory to her story.  If you write another book in this series, you must show depth in the character from the beginning.  Have Becky take lessons home from this and previous books into the next book.  Furthermore, stop the supporting characters simply enabling her in the next book.  I have been reading your books for years, but I am close to calling it quits.
B00004SCX6|5|Britney is truly magical. She's actually singing more on this album and you can tell. Best song Stronger. Buy it, totally awesome, you won't regret it.

B00LTU9ORK|4|For my first review, I've decided to write about my most favorite release of 2014: Evergrey's Hymns for the Broken.<br /><br />The truth is, I'd never listened to Evergrey prior to this album.  Sure, I'd heard of the band.  I just hadn't listened to them.  For whatever reason, they were never recommended to me by my immediate circle of prog pals.  But I'd seen their name pop up frequently on the Dream Theater Forums, which I visit quite regularly, and I noticed the high praise for the new tunes.  And so, during a slow day at work, I finally decided to check out this band once and for all.<br /><br />As someone approaching the band with fresh ears, I unfortunately can't compare Hymns for the Broken to the band's past albums.  But I can say is that this album has made me a fan that plans to check out those past albums.  From the album's earliest moments, you know you're in for something more than just a collection of songs – you're in for a special journey.  The album starts with sounds of war – galloping horses, a helicopter, voices crying in pain.  Then a speaking voice.  &#34;We've crowned a king with no soul; when all doors are closed we walk alone.&#34;  You can quickly tell that this is an album about an internal struggle – a battle between happiness and sadness, or good and evil, or self worth and self loathing – all told with a well-crafted war metaphor.  It's a fight we've all experienced at some point in our life.  It's something we can all relate to.  And Evergrey unifies us through our common sorrow.<br /><br />The album's single, &#34;King of Errors,&#34; is the first track after the intro.  It's a beast of a song that's hard not to love.  It starts off with an instrumental section that briefly reminds me of &#34;Anarchy-X&#34; from Queensrÿche's Operation: Mindcrime.  But by the end, it is all Evergrey.  Tom Englund's emotional voice shines from the very first lines and a scorching guitar solo demonstrates this band has the technical abilities to hold their own against any of today's progressive metal juggernauts.  It would be easy for the energy to dip a bit after a monster like &#34;King of Errors.&#34;  But it doesn't.  In fact, there are no weak songs on the album at all.  They all firmly rank between an 8.5 and 9.5, in my opinion.  It reminded me of Megadeth's Youthanasia album in that way – or most recent Rush albums.  Solid from start to finish.<br /><br />Hymns is also a very well-balanced album.  Englund channels his inner Michael Bolton on the piano ballad &#34;Missing You,&#34; followed by crushing riffs in tunes like &#34;The Grand Collapse.&#34;  The latter is the album's longest song at 7:48.  It is also, no doubt, is the most progressive.  The middle of the song is filled with more war sounds, leaving you to wonder who ultimately won the internal battle – a question that is answered on the final track.  I'd be lying if I said the progressiveness of &#34;The Grand Collapse&#34; didn't make me wish that the previous, more straightforward, songs had some more progressive elements on this level.  If they did, this album would easily be a 10/10.  But that's the closest I can come to a Hymns criticism.<br /><br />I was shocked to learn in interviews that Evergrey considered disbanding prior to writing and recording this album.  What a crime that would have been.  This is clearly a band with a lot left in the tank and a lot left to say.  If Hymns is any taste of what the future might hold for Evergrey, then the band's fans are in for a major treat in the years, and albums, to come.<br /><br />- Michael R.

B005LAIHZY|5|Best Disney movie. No prince charming, just focuses on the relationship of Merida and her mother. Well written. What children should really be thinking about.
B00GAVJ77K|5|This app saved my kindle fire if I didn't even get the app<br />my kindle wouldn't work at all.
B005USZYDU|5|exiting reading .  The book kept me away from television.  I enjoyed the writing style.  The<br />Plot was simple but interesting.
B004EBUXSA|5|This little processor has some incredible visuals, speed and value for the money. Inside has powerful integrated HD visuals with turbo overcklingc ddr3 memory controller supports 32GB and its just amazing. I could play COD Black Ops, design a flyer in photoshop and browse the web without any issue with visuals, speed or even heat. This is great and incredible. I have this baby on a ASRock Extreme3 Gen3 PCI3.0 with 16GB G.Skill RipjawsX PC3-1700 2133MHz & OCZ Vertex3 60GB SATAIII SSD 6.0Gb/s, the speeds are just unbeliaveble. I played Crysis 2, Battlefield 2, Metro 2033, Medal of Honor, Unreal Tournament 3, Fear 3, Gears of War 2, Assasin's Creed: Brotherhood, Homefront, etc. I'm completely satisfied with my new PC because I feel like is the best I ever had built completely by myself with the highest and newest additions. I love intel products. Extremely recomended!
0061950726|5|Just a wonderful book.  Makes one so appreciative of one's childhood and better informed of what the 1,000's of children experience on the Orphan Train.  Well written and held my interest until the very end.
B00A6PD9I4|5|I laughed so hard in parts of this I was crying. I especially enjoyed the message that you have to stand up for what you believe in even if it's different than what your family wants for you, but it also showed that standing up for those freedoms and needs also comes with a personal responsibility.
B00GMV8M2Y|4|good movie
B00BFUUMO8|5|love it! it adds all of the dinosaurs from the movie! love it even though there are a fie bugs.
B00CO8D3G4|4|This book is a reminder that it's the simply things in life that provides the greatest rewards. The things that grab my attention and made me choose this book was the dedication at the beginning.
B00APUYN0I|4|A fun packed movie with great performances.<br />For those that like Glee and Smash this is a go to movie.<br />Not a big fan of those shows myself but thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.
B00BSBU4EC|5|I rented this movie for my daughter and wife to watch on a Saturday night.  We make it into a movie night when my daughter takes an early bath and we sit back, have some popcorn and watch a movie.  This movie had a good story and was very pleasant to watch. If it means anything, my daughter did not want to go to bed after watching this movie.  She was really into it.  My wife and I also liked it so it is good for adults too.  Overall, I liked the movie a great deal and would rent it again if someone in my family wanted to watch it.
B000066C1N|5|I listen to this cd almost every day and the kids I watch love singing along and dancing in the car.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|The stories were a little confusing at the beginning but once I figured out the characters, it was very good. I started with the sample and it was so good that I bought the book.  Glad I did.  Very interesting ending.
B00CDTSQZW|3|Its write that its supposed to be in french but its not ....real disapointed but good shipping time
B0034G4P7Q|2|Imagine that you do something large, wonderful (mostly) and you become famous.      A well regarded film producer makes a movie allegedly about your actions, uses your name and real names of others, but it's fiction.  \\"Composite characters\\".  And it contains just enough true information to LOOK like it's not fiction.    Hint: Zuckerberg got involved with his current girlfriend during sophomore year of college.  Whatever reasons he may have had for creating Facebook, romantic relationships do not appear to be a strong underling factor.    Ignoring the dishonesty, I found the movie to be just ok. The main reason I watched it (on an airplane BTW) was because the film itself had become a major issue, something of a cultural milestone, and seems to be winning awards.    So, IMHO, it's just not that great of a movie, and it is misleading as well.
B00BLCHZC2|5|The first few books that got me into reading were based on Vikings. It's wonderfully accurate to their beliefs and traditions.
B0089LOG02|4|Excellent story, weaving fiction and history together in a way that holds your interest from page 1 to the end.  I just recently learned about the orphan trains, which were a well-intentioned idea of how to care for orphans during a tough economic times, before we had any governmental programs in place.  Like many ideas, this one worked out okay for some of the children, but was horrible for others.  Kind of an early version of our foster program, but with virtually no oversight!
B0054JZC6E|4|I really love this game... its fun and addictive. i like the kill sushi one the absolute best. I recommend this to everyone.
B000069AT7|5|I bought the E.T. Box set at a reduced price recently because I refused to buy the altered version of the film! THIS HAS GOT TO STOP AND STOP NOW! Where do we draw the line? Are we gong to do CGI over the original \\"King Kong\\"? Are we going to color Hattie McDaniels's skin color white in \\"Gone With The Wind\\"? It is getting ridiculous what we are putting up with! People need to get over themselvies and stop being so sensitive. I just watched the Godfather trilogy and I'm Italian American! Am I complaining that Italians are protrayed as Gangsters? No! We could go back and forth all day talking about this, but in short....let things stay intact! No altering films or art etc., whether its a classic or not! It is what it is! OK?????? Ahhhh I feel slightly better now! The original film E.T is a wonderful film that seemed even better than I remembered. The DVD transfer looks great and the audio was really surprisingly good! The is an excellent film, but look for the gift set cheap. AVOID THE SINGLE DISC LIKE THE PLAGUE!
B000089RVX|5|FINALLY! A new band that can make us grin when we turn on the radio and find Amy Lee belting out those great lyrics with that beautiful voice instead of hearing a bunch of rappers with computerized music! Why, yes, Forest Law, they do play their own instruments and write their own lyrics. Extraordinarily. The songs are awesome. The instrumentals are awesome. Amy Lee is awesome. Are you readers out there catching my drift? I've had the Evanescence CD for....I dont know how long now and I listen to it everyday at least three times, at minimum and I never tire of it. They've become my absolute favorite band. They arent rap-rockers, by the way. And no, the rest of their songs do not sound like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. But hey, I'll let the people who buy the CD decide that. Go with the majority, people. This band is awesome. And I cannot wait until I can see them in concert! My dad's friend went, but it was in Florida and I live no where near there. But he called me and let me listen to it, and they were great. They arent a hoax, they arent Lacuna Coil posers, and Amy Lee has an excellent voice, you idiots! Readers, buy the CD, you wont be disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|4|I've been playing deer Hunter for a few weeks now, it has unfortunately begun clutching and freezing my kindle. Bummer too, because now I had money and the weaponry I needed.
0553418025|5|Picked up this book after seeing the first teaser trailer for the movie and deciding that I couldn't wait until December. Devoured the book in a day, and enjoyed every moment of it. I cannot recommend this book enough, it's witty, well written, extremely engaging, and balances the fine line between science-y and still being accessible by the average layman.
B00IS87HYI|5|This is such a fun game.  The kids can play and adults like it too!
B000QGAU4E|3|Clive Owen is a wonderful actor and the movies simply wasted his talent, I thought. Otherwise, the plot was OK, not great. I suppose it was meant to be a wake-up call to the public at large, but fell short in my opinion.
B002VPE1WK|5|Great dslr bag. Very spacious inside with padding to protect all the equipment. Exactly what I was looking for without going to a specialty store
B00G32OER4|5|Was a great movie cant say anymore do not want to give it away. You got to see this movie
B00E8KLWB4|5|Although I am new at this game, I am enjoying it immensely. It did not take this elder long to learn the ropes. The game can be played without purchasing anything extra as long as one doesn't mind having to be patient. This best tip I can give is to have more one of these types of games going at the same time to extend your playing pleasure.
B000000OU0|5|Well, this is an awesome CD whether or not your an Eagles fan or not. If you are, there's no doubt you have to get it. But even if you're not wild about the Eagles and like '70s soft rock, I would give this a try. Almost all of the songs are better than the originals. My favourite is &quot;Learn To Be Still&quot;. I also love &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, &quot;In The City&quot;, &quot;New York Minute&quot;, and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, the last one unfortunately didn't get released on the cd. I suggest getting the video as well, it was incredible to watch. These guys just rule :)

Given the cultic frenzy that surrounded the opening, given the peek the first Matrix provided into a world in which mankind had been played the fool by his Machines and shackled into an invisible bondage---given all of that, could anything deliver on such a Promise?<br /><br />The answer, in true Matrix fashion: Revolutions is a Binary flick. You know, those little zeroes and ones that, taken together, represent The Holy Bible, or a storefront, or a superpowered cadillac sedan driven by two dredlocked razor-wielding monsters. The Desert of the Real; the World of Illusion.<br /><br />With that in mind...<br /><br />ONE: The Matrix Rating (the World of Illusion): 5 Stars. Reloaded is a technophile's fever-dream, and in this glossy, mechanistic, techno-sensual Real the Wachowskis entertain in spades.<br /><br />Reloaded oozes style, just like its predecessor, and the supple combination of high-technology glossiness and urban grime that defined the unique visuals of the first movie have been delivered seamlessly into the sequel.<br /><br />That's no surprise, since the Wachowskis wisely brought the entire team from the first movie along for the second ride. On hand for the sequel is Director of Photography Bill Pope and Costume Designer Kym Barrett, and both deliver the goods. Reloaded looks jaw-droppingly, drool-spatteringly delicious.<br /><br />The original cast (minus, sadly, Tank & Apoc) are all back as well: Morpheus (an increasingly portly Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Neo (an increasingly Zen Keanu Reeves) all turn in competent, if not outstanding, performances, and Hugo Weaving's nefarious Agent Smith tries not to steal the show (and mostly fails: Reloaded is at its best when Weaving is snarling and mincing onscreen).<br /><br />The Wachowskis toss in some other intriguing characters to round out the ensemble, including the dastardly Merovingian (played suavely, but talkatively, by Lambert Wilson), his gorgeous mistress Persephone (played tastily by Monica Bellucci), his razor-wielding Twin henchmen (done not with CGI, but played by real-life twins Adrian and Neil Rayment and a real-life razorblade!), and Jada Pinkett Smith's understated Captain Niobe.<br /><br />So it entertains. But...<br /><br />ZERO: The Desert of the Real Rating: 3 Stars. Is this the flick you wanted to see, thought you would see, when the credits rolled at the end of \\"The Matrix\\"?<br /><br />Me neither. Yes, \\"Reloaded\\" is anchored fore and aft and amidships with some eye-popping action setpieces, chiefly the Freeway chase and the mountain-top Chalet duel with the Merovingian's lackeys. Yes, it oozes style from its steel and CGI pores. If \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" were a ship, it would have mighty pretty rigging and sails.<br /><br />Yes, it was cool to see the big exo-skeleton walkers lumbering around in Zion. No, I didn't find the Zion Rave scene embarrassing (celebrate, party like it's 1999 chal, 'cause we're FREE! I can dig it).<br /><br />But after the \\"Burn the Barricades!\\" coda of the first flick, I wanted something more. Neo can bend the \\"rules\\" of the Matrix now: he can tweak all those leetle zeroes and ones in his favor. So why stick around to fight Agent Smith in the tedious 'Burly Brawl'? Why not conjure up a few werewolves of his own to keep him busy?<br /><br />Or, while we're at it---if 'waking up' those slave-minds is so critical to the Revolution, why not *really* shake things up a bit? You know, mebbe introduce a few square miles of the Kalihari Desert in the middle of the City?<br /><br />Seen in the LED readout-afterburn of \\"Matrix: Revolutions\\", \\"Reloaded\\" makes considerably more sense: certainly it's operatic in its sleek, luxurious gloss and glamor.<br /><br />But the real problem is this: the first \\"Matrix\\" was our very unauthorized glimpse into the Truth behind \\"Reality\\". It felt like finding out a very dangerous, dirty secret. It felt conspiratorial, which was half the fun.<br /><br />It's pretty, true, and if you pick up the Ultimate collection and pop this baby in the hopper of your high-end system, you'll watch in amazement as the rafters shake, plaster cracks and falls, car alarms go off.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, \\"Reloaded\\" is just another big action flick. Reloaded? Reheated---but still pretty tasty.<br /><br />JSGow: he can tweak all those leetle zeroes and ones in his favor. So why stick around to fight Agent Smith in the tedious 'Burly Brawl'?

B0062QRTKA|1|This was the free app the day I installed it, butit was still over priced! The graphics and animation is cheesy. On the whole, it needs more work!
B004LUS390|5|Love this app for crating some really cool art. Takes a lot of practice to learn how to work the app the way you want. The tools are really cool! I like SB Mobile better! Surf the web and watch videos of people making pictures on their phones with this app!
B007T7MIR0|4|Some problems with the app.
B005GFPZYK|5|If you want to know what happens on the battlefield, this is a must read.  I felt like I was sitting in a room listening to war stories.  The way he writes about his wife is lovely.  A truly great man.
B00005QFE5|5|The movie starts with a son returning back from the city when his father dies to help his mom fulfill her wish to give her husband a traditional burial.  Starting in black and white the films turns to color during his mother's flashback, as she explains how she first met her husband and WHY the traditional burial is so important.  A story of love coming first, even before, funny enough, the tradition of arranged marriages.  Full of culture and touching moments.
B004GUSG4M|4|Pretty good, and an original plot.

B00005JM02|5|To tell the truth, I've been meaning to see &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; since it came out, but just never got around to doing it. So last Saturday, I caved in, took a trip to Blockbuster's and watched it. I don't regret a second of it.<br />My friend Robert was initially reluctant to go see this movie because he believed it would be a &quot;silly children's movie.&quot; Naturally, I argued with him. Several months after this, he came up to me one day and admitted that he'd just seen &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and had been totally wrong about it. He absolutely loved it. Actually, I think it would be hard not to.<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply the best animated movie I've seen in a very long time (probably since &quot;The Lion King&quot;). From the very menu screen on (just trust me), it's wonderful. It's simply hilarious and it's very, very cute. It starts out with a beginning worthy of &quot;Bambi&quot; and proceeds to tell the tale of a father and his son, two clownfish who live on the reef. It's very rare to see such an endearing father-son film as this one - &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is terrifically special in that sense.<br />The story itself involves Marlin (Nemo's dad) trying to find his lost son and Nemo himself trying to escape from the aquarium he has been trapped in. In his journey, Marlin encounters Dory, who is personally my favorite character in the film. Dory has some problems with her short term memory. Ellen DeGeneres does a beautiful, funny job as Dory's voice. My very favorite scene is about two seconds long, but I'd watch the whole movie just for it: it involves Dory's &quot;squishy&quot; (a little jellyfish), but beyond that, you'll just have to see it for yourself. Yes, it's really that good!<br />The story and characters are certainly memorable in themselves. Yet, the visual imagery in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply breathtaking. It looks *real*, truly underwater, right down to the shafts of sunlight and the rippling pattern of the lighton the reef. The DVD even has an &quot;aquarium&quot; feature so you can just relax and stare at scenes from the reef. I really don't know how to describe with it, but my response was sheer amazement. I didn't know we could do stuff like that!<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has definitely worked its way into being one of my favorite movies. I bet in ten or twenty years from now it will be as much a classic as &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; are now.
B000002NZO|5|For anyone who isn't familiar with Genesis' early stuff... this CD is a must have.  To hear Peter Gabriel's heart-wrenching, soulful sound is quite extraordinary.  No Genesis library is complete without their early stuff and Trespass is NO exception.  Only six songs on the CD, but each song is a treasure.<br /><br />You could hear even then, that they would be HUGE!  The talented artists who put together this album may not have all made it into Genesis' later recordings, but this one in my opinion, is a classic!<br /><br />I still get shivers when I hear Peter opening on \\"Looking For Someone\\" and \\"Visions of Angels\\".  In my opinion, two of the prettiest melodies ever produced by Genesis.<br /><br />I know this is the album that did it for me all those years ago... one listen and I was hooked.  A fan for LIFE!
B005HWUBZ0|5|Great new sound by Mayer Hawthorn - just became familiar with this group and the entire CD is awesome! Different sound and I love it.
0061438294|5|Ever wondered what a furrowed brow really means? Or how to tell if someone is actually listening to what you're saying? Or why you feel more in control when you stand, lean forward, spread your arms, and place your hands on the table in front of you?<br /><br />Author Joe Navarro, former FBI agent, is an expert in interpreting body language. In his revealing book, What Every Body Is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People, he breaks the body into categories --- feet and legs in one chapter, hands and fingers in another --- and catalogs each movement a person can make, and what it means.<br /><br />With real-life examples from his work history and personal life, Navarro makes interpreting body language an approachable topic. Want to know how to convey interest when you're being interviewed for a job you want? Or the most disrespectful eye movement to watch for in your kids or significant other? Navarro has the answers.<br /><br />His tone is engaging and informative, despite the academic subject matter; he held my interest all the way through the book. Body movements I've always wondered about --- and some I've never even thought about before --- can be practically interpreted, and the resulting comprehension only benefits you and those with whom you interact.<br /><br />For Writers<br /><br />Picture a character in your current work who needs a quirk or hobby. Why not let him/her be an expert in reading people? What consequences would that have on dialogue, character interactions, and relationships? In a mystery, the sleuth is often able to read others --- but what does that look like in a romance? or a dystopian novel?<br /><br />Play with the possibilities!

B000E1ZBGS|5|I love Pride and Prejudice (the novel and the A&E miniseries) most ardently. Joe Wright's adaptation will likely disturb Austenites, so consider yourselves warned and need not watch :) I believe it is also pointless to compare a 2-hr adaptation to any of the 4 1/2 hr versions. So, if you get over that and you would like  a movie to entertain you with breathtaking cinematography, adorable updated dialogues, deft acting, and a musical score that inspires without being overwhelming, then this is for you.  <br /> <br />The central cast is younger than previous adaptations but equally brilliant. Knightley truly has Elizabeth's  \\"fine eyes,\\" but not distractingly beautiful, expressive but not deliberate. MacFadyen unfolded Darcy's in a compelling manner; proud but endearingly awkward, confident yet reticent, elegant yet subtly sexy (and I love, love, love his eyes). <br /> <br />Cons: 1. the heavy reliance of the film to imagery and nuances (in the novel and in other adaptations, most of the P and P elements are presented as dialogues; follow the camera's movement and be very observant!) <br />3. use of the napoleonic era timeline, as oppose to the more aesthetic victorian era backdrop that P and P fans have gotten used to <br /> <br />Pros: 1. use of the napoleonic era timeline; makes the film less stodgy, less pompous, more grounded <br />2. fresh take on the classic but most romantic; the display of emotions are more intense  (a more spirited Elizabeth, a less elegant Darcy-in-love; Jane is less sedate and a fleeting scene that shows Bingley reaching for Jane's dress, desperate for any form of physical contact) <br />3. a sense of urgency was captured without the abuse of a nattering Mrs. Bennet <br />4. my favorite: unusual for his countenance, Mr. Darcy comes out disheveled in his night clothes and desperately seeks Elizabeth through the mist. It is a powerful show of yearning that romantics will find gratifying <br /> <br />I find most happy endings in romantic films to be contrived, but this is one romantic film where I found myself hoping and staying for the kiss. <br />

B000002KIK|5|It always facinates me to hear the guys in Sabbath say they didn't care for albums like Sabatoge and Never Say Die. I think they remember the events surrounding the albums more than the actual music. Never Say Die is a fantastic album no matter what anyone says. You really won't find the classic sludge of Master of Reality on Never Say Die but you will find Sabbath acting like a real group and expanding on different styles in the same manner Zeppelin did. If Sabbath released a new album you can bet it would be a bit more 'by the numbers' and that would be fine since we all want a new Sabbath album anyway. But this is probably the most diverse album Sabbath ever did. Does this mean this is the quinissential Sabbath album? Of course not. But it does mean it's a great album to really hear what Sabbath was capable of, regardless if you dig their ideas at the time. Once Ozzy was gone, Sabbath took a step in the new metal sound of the time and an album like Never Say Die would never be a possibility following this. Buy this album and dig it.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this!  its just like flappy bird! Maybe even better I think :p I'm gaining levels so fast! okai too much excitement. I really love it though.
B002W6Z0UK|5|This cd is just awesome. It brings your emotions up and then down. Every track is interesting and more or less tells a story. At first, I wasn't sure about a few tracks (since I mainly bought it for 'Bad Romance'), but once I actually sat down and listened to the lyrics/sound, I ended up loving them all. If you are a Gaga fan, you MUST have this album. =]

B000F7CMRM|1|Maybe I'm stupid, but I have no idea what this movie was about. Something to do with oil and coruption. But other than that, I couldn't really figure out who the characters were and what they were doing. The cast was WAY too big and the storylines kept jumping around so fast that by the time it got back around to what George Clooney was doing I had forgotten what he did in the scene prior to that. I was completely lost in this very confusing movie.
B006T4NQNO|2|This ring is lightweight poly or plastic of some kind and you have to be really careful when trying to thread a filter on it. I don't believe it is durable and am looking for a backup in case this one breaks. Would'nt take muck impact IMHO.
B000FBGBPC|5|In June 2006, rockers Three Days Grace released their fantastic and strongest CD yet with their sophomore album, One-X.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever been in a horrible relationship, (especially one that has just recently ended), can relate to the lyrics in these songs.  Angry?  Frustrated?  Depressed?  Feeling hopeless?  Just got dumped?  Just dumped someone else?  There's a song on here for every downing emotion, letting you know that you're not alone in your misery.<br /><br />If you're not a big Three Days Grace fan and you want to be, this is a great album to start out with.  Their self-titled debut CD was decent enough, with such hits as \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"I Hate Everything About You\\", which put them on the map, but the real meat of their career is on One-X.<br /><br />Below is a brief description of each track on the album, with a numerical rating.<br /><br />Track 1: It's All Over--(7)--TDG come out with guns blazing on the first track.  Frontman Adam Gontier spreads his gritty voice over the darkened lyrics of this song, in which the subject is ruining their life with drugs and alcohol and Gontier can only sit back and watch them destroy themselves.<br /><br />Track 2: Pain--(10)--an excellent angsty song when you need one.  Dole out the pain, because hurting is better than not feeling anything at all when you become so numb and jaded.<br /><br />Track 3: Animal I Have Become--(9)--chances are, you've probably seen the music video for this song where Gontier turns into a freakish looking creature while the band rocks out behind him.  This song is a metaphor for becoming something you truly don't want to become, but have no control over it taking over you anyway.<br /><br />Track 4: Never Too Late--(9)-- a hopeful song that it's not too late to turn everything around, even when you think it is.  When you're in the deepest, darkest pit of despair and you can only think about ending it all, you need to realize that it's not too late--it never is, as long as you're breathing.  You can still fix what went wrong if you just try.<br /><br />Track 5: On My Own--(9)--a truly sad part ballad/part rocker about regretting when things went wrong in a former relationship and wishing you could just walk it off, forget it, but you can't--you just regret too much.  However, despite that, you'll stand up and try to move on, live life on your own now.  There's no saving the relationship now, so like it or not, it's time to move on without her.<br /><br />Track 6: Riot--(8)--a great song for when you're seething angry over something.  Somebody made you feel angry, used up, ripped off, stepped on and you're going to fight back.  To hell with them all!  Riot against them!<br /><br />Track 7: Get Out Alive--(7)--don't depend on others to keep you going.  If you want to get out alive, you're going to have to hold on for your life.  Do it for yourself and depend only on yourself 'cause others will only let you down.<br /><br />Track 8: Let It Die--(10)--a relationship gone wrong, she says he didn't try, but he didn't mean to let it die--he just fell out of love with her.  He tried as hard as he could while he could, but the motivation left him.  It was good in the beginning, but the beginning doesn't last forever.<br /><br />Track 9: Over and Over--(8)--he tries as best he can to pull himself away from her.  He knows this situation isn't good for him, yet he keeps falling for her over and over again.  He's tried to live without her, but when he succeeds, he feels dead inside.  He needs her to survive.<br /><br />Track 10: Time of Dying--(8)--he's dying right now without her but he will survive until she can be by his side again. He'll wait for her because he only feels alive when she's beside him.<br /><br />Track 11: Gone Forever--(10)--absolutely fantastic rock ballad about break-up denial.  He'll go out, he'll drink, get in some fights, be completely miserable, but he'll tell himself that he's better off and happier without her in a failed attempt to fool himself.<br /><br />Track 12: One-X--(5)--the only weak track on the entire CD.  A song about how everything we've been through connects us all, life or death situations, depression, everything.  You think no one has ever felt the way you do and so does everyone else, which makes us all One(-X).<br /><br />Overall album rating: 8.5everything we've been through connects us all, life or death situations, depression, everything.  You think no one has ever felt the way you do and so does everyone else, which makes us all One(-X).    Overall album rating: 8.5
B003WUYOQ6|5|Very interesting book. The author did a great job relaying the information... READ THIS BOOK!
B00HBQWGXK|5|This is the best Jack Reacher I have read so far. Cannot wait until the next one to come out.
0446604844|5|For being one of his earlier one-off novels, this was by far the best written from the period, so far. The writing, plotting and movement of the story far exceeded the previous two early novels I’ve read.<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable ride with plenty of mystery, plot twists and action. There may have been spots where I had to suspend my disbelief just a tad, but nothing where I had to put the book down and go whoa!<br /><br />The only issue I had with the whole experience was the author’s tendency to head-hop. There were some spots in the story where he did it with abandon, yet, for the most part, he kept the reins on without losing focus on the main character driving the scene. There were a few places where the characters shifted throughout a scene and barely tagged to one, from start to finish. That was a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall, despite the writing quirk, I was glued to my seat and had a great time. This was the author starting to find his chops, which really came to shine in his later works. Highly recommended.
0316204366|3|As far as it goes, the book is a good read. What's lacking is the Positive Paradigm to put David and Goliath in context. From this viewpoint, Goliath was stuck on the surface. Despite his physical size, he was ultimately powerless. David, on the other hand, was connected to center. That gave him the advantage.<br /><br />Using this model, we can place the source of David's strength as well as his strategies and his deadly slingshot. Resting in the innermost hub of the wheel was the source of little David's confidence -- the timeless God of Israel. His strategies, however, belonged to the dynamic, energy level. His prowess as a straight-shooter depended on physical strength, visual acuity and years of experience. Those have their place on the material surface. In other words, the levels of David's life were coordinated. They were in synch. Unified.<br /><br />If David had drawn a blank on any one of the three paradigm levels, he wouldn't have succeed then. Nor can anyone succeed today. Vision that's not backed by a good plan and technical competence is incomplete. Cunning strategies lacking equal competence to execute them are lop-sided. Without a direct connection with the creative center, all the physical resources in the world aren't enough.<br /><br />There are several reasons, however, why the story of David and Goliath isn't the best model for coping with adversity today. For one, we're at a very different point in history. This is end stage. Civilization was relatively young back then. Different times call for different responses.<br /><br />Further, confronting a single foe face-to-face was one matter. The tangled mess of corporate-faced, alien-driven evil which little guys are up against now is a much different threat. Different dangers call for different protections.<br /><br />Another point: Gladwell's subtitle refers to underdogs and misfits. It's not a good idea to romanticize misfits. Timothy McVey and Charles Manson were misfits. They didn't fit in with mainstream society, but with good cause.<br /><br />It's the telescoping mistake. Extremes on both sides of the bell-shaped median are lumped together and written off as \\"deviant.\\" But spiritual geniuses and murderous psychopaths don't belong in the same category.<br /><br />Further, not all giants are enemies of the people. There are corporate CEOs who treat their workers decently and genuinely serve the public. Jon Huntsman is one outstanding example. As a philanthropist, Huntsman has given away more than $1.2 billion to both domestic and international charities. His humanitarian aid includes help to the homeless, ill and under-privileged. He holds that the very rich should give not half, as Gates and Buffet say, but a full 80 percent of their wealth to worthy causes. It should be through voluntary choice, however. Not taxation. In this, he agrees with Thomas Paine's Common Sense.<br /><br />His goal is to give away everything before he dies. But this isn't an easy task. He keeps making too much money.<br /><br />Gladwell says little guys need to redefine power. That's what the Positive Paradigm does. True power comes from within. Goliath, who drew strength primarily from the physical plane, was puny compared to the force behind David's sling.<br /><br />Gladwell notes that a single smooth stone to center of Goliath's head probably destroyed the pituitary gland. He quotes researchers who theorize that the giant had a glandular disorder which explains his huge size. This same pituitary disease would have caused eye problems. That's probably why a slave had to lead him into battle. Presumably his vision was failing.<br /><br />But from a holistic perspective, the same story has a deeper meaning. David's single shot went straight to the third eye, the ajna center located in the center of the forehead. It correlates with the pineal gland, a close neighbor of the pituitary. In yoga anatomy, this center is associated with spiritual vision.<br /><br />David's projectile put out the giant's lights. It was poetic justice for an enemy who was closed to inner truth. That was the giant's weakness. It remains the weakness of bad guys today as well. A single shot is all it takes, when you know where to aim.<br /><br />David and Goliath has one take on the giants of the world. But there's also another way to think about giants. The reverse, shadow side. The opposite side of the coin.I was inspired by Awaken the Giant Within. I founded the +A Positive Action Press in response to Tony Robbins' book. From a Positive Paradigm perspective, his words take on new meaning:<br /><br />\\"If we want to discover the unlimited possibilities within us, we must find a goal big enough and grand enough to challenge us to push beyond our limits and discover our true potential. . . The answer to our current energy challenges will lie in the imagination and resourcefulness of today's physicists and engineers. And the resolution to our social crises, like the alarming spread of racial hate groups, homelessness, and hunger, can only be addressed with the inventiveness and compassion of dedicated individuals like you and me.\\"<br /><br />The threat of evil giants in the world serves to awaken the true giant that resides deep within each of us. That's the blessing hidden in adversity. It's the opportunity latent in Titanic Times. The Greek Titans, the giants sired by Kronos, survived his murderous envy and returned to claim their heritage. Similarly, there are giants are among us now. It's time for them to WAKE UP!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00H9OTAWE Rethinking Survival: Getting to the Positive Paradigm of Change]]

B0009QBLA8|1|This is the worst waste of time ever created. I can tell you enough what an awful movie this is. There are no redeeming qualities.
B004O3YGMC|5|Easy to use. Best remote program out there for my Kindle Fire. I use this program to watch movies stored on my home computer anywhere I can get WiFi.
B000F1IQN2|4|I've always been curious about the events at Munich in 1972 and the ensuing Israeli response.  \\"Munich\\" provided me with a worthy account of both.  In addition, it offered a perspective of those individuals who were thrust together to operate as a retaliatory cell, some members of which questioned their own methods and actions.<br /><br />While the ending was cinematically fitting and suitable, it left you hanging as to the outcome of its main character.  Normally that would be fine, but in this case we're talking about a real person.  At the end of \\"Serpico,\\" for example, we get told that he moved to France, but we get nothing like that here.  Some closure would have been beneficial.
1449305172|5|In my opinion, Ash Maurya is one of the greatest minds in the startup world. In this book Ash drives you from concept to practical tactics regarding how to apply Lean actions to build a product. Among with names like Eric Reis and Alexander Osterwalder, Ash Maurya is a must read for all entrepreneur building a new company from the ground-up.<br /><br />One of the thinks I like most is how he identify the real key points a startup company should be concerned of. Take as an example his approach to the Lean Canvas in comparison with Osterwalder's BMG Canvas. While both are very practical and work for any company, the Lean canvas seems to address the real deal for startups.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Eric
B005K0HDGE|5|My father said I would like this book....and as always, he was right!  Was sorry for the book to end!
B000023VR6|5|This November, Dr. Dre blasted back onto the scene with his highly anticipated sequel to The Chronic.  In this release, Dr. Dre reunites with Snoop Dogg, who appears on multiple tracks.  Also included in the mix are  rappers X-hibit, Eminem, and others along with comedian Eddie Griffin.  Dr.  Dre outdoes himself with this album.  The tracks flow like a waterfall,  pouring out the hits.  Dre puts out unique beats that are off the hook and  brings us back to the days of the old.  If you are a fan of hip-hop or rap,  then this is a must have; period. One of the best rap albums in years.
B000001EAQ|4|When this album was released, the public opinion was polarized.  Critics were basically split between loving it and hating it.  Many longtime U2 fans were scared off by the &quot;techno&quot; label and had given up hope for U2.  Well let me give my honest opinion and set a few things straight.<br />First off, Pop is definitely not techno.  It may have some electronic dance elements thrown in, but it is not very danceable.  The only track that comes close to full-blown techno is &quot;MOFO&quot;.  This is a rock and roll record with real songs--I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't.  I admit I was hesitant to buy Pop because I heard all the hype about U2-goes-techno, but I got it and was pleasantly surprised.  Pop is not a &quot;pop&quot; album; it is a rock record that is difficult to understand, but very rewarding if you do.<br />There are plenty of good songs.  The tripped-out rocker &quot;Discotheque&quot; leads the way, with a deadly catchy guitar riff played by U2's resident genius, The Edge.  &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; is another good tune with great guitar and bass playing. &quot;MOFO&quot; is one of the most startling tracks U2 ever recorded, because it is rampaging and quite disturbing at times.  That song is followed by the lovely &quot;If God Would Send His Angels,&quot; a plaintive plea to God with some of Bono's best singing on the album.  It is the first in a handfull of EXCELLENT songs--&quot;Staring at the Sun,&quot; &quot;Last Night On Earth,&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; are all fantastic songs with clever lyrics and catchy-but-not-corny melodies.  The next two songs, &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;The Playboy Mansion,&quot; are the only songs on Pop I don't like; they cost an otherwise outstanding album a fifth star.  However, U2 justify themselves on the chills-up-your-spine &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress,&quot; the melancholy &quot;Please,&quot; and the pleading &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;.  <br />Overall, this a solid album from a band with very high standards.  The only drawbacks are the one or two sub-par songs and the occasionally poor production.  However, if you don't close your ears before listening, you might be surprised how much you like it.  It is not a bad album at all!
B0071LLHGC|5|This is some really great ABB, the music is from the heart.  I found a link to download this for free, just Google it.  I did find a copy on Ebay, so it has to travel across the pond.  Duane Allman is much a legend as Hendrix and it is clear on these recordings.  This is a must have for any fan.  Jam on.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is simple and easy to play. Old time frogger type of game, in which you try to cross the road. Not as easy as it sounds. I like the toons you get to earn as you earn coins. Over all thus is a great game. Give it a try, you have nothing to loose since it's free.
B004132HZS|5|I was instantly hooked in the first five minutes of the first episode. A brilliant cast and brilliant writers. Cheers from the US!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|This book confirmed what I always suspected.  Jesus didn't intend to make us Christians.  He just wanted to make us better Jews.  It was St. Paul and all the good converts around Rome who set up our religion.  However, Jesus must have been something special to God; otherwise, he would have been forgotten along with all the other &#34;messiahs&#34; who were preaching at the same time.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Best game EVER, I can't stop playing this game... I love that there's NO glitches! I'd say thus game is Very ADDICTIVE!!!
B00AF6MF9I|3|It's a fun game and everything but it won't let mii go to my allies bases at all except the Sargent's. But other wise a gud game to play so if there's a way to go tell mii .
B008YWY0HK|5|This movie is great for little girls. Shows them how to honor tradition as well as be adventurous, inventive and loyal. I was expecting the usual Disney princess story line but this proved to be much, much better. You can grow up to be a woman without having to rely on a man. Who knew.
B000063Y8F|5|I saw this in the catalog - and decided to get one. It was a bit pricey, but I figured it might be worth the money (a bit of a gamble).<br />This is THE BEST garlic press I have used yet. Granted, that only covers 14 other presses, but this one is the best. period. First of all - it is nice, heavy stainless steel. There are no parts to lose - this thing is engineered better than my little german VW diesel golf.<br />The handle folds all the way back, exposing the grate for easy cleanup. The press mechanism itself is mechanically assisted - that is to say - it is a small lever - it multiplies the force to crush the clove, so you don't have to squeeze as hard. The pins on the hinge are nice, HEAVY pins. This thing isn't coming apart like those cheap aluminum ones.<br />Handles are solid stainless steel - this thing is great.<br />If you are even thinking about getting a different one - think again. Then get this one instead.<br />You won't be dissapointed.<br />The ONLY thing that could be improved on this press would be if I could buy them at a cheaper price....

B00AIQP9DE|5|good game love hidden object games g5 offers a wide variety of wonderful games to choose from look forward to playing more of them
0804139024|5|Surprised at how well written this is, considering it's a first novel.  Found it to be instantly engaging, and kept my attention for the entire length of the book.  I look forward to more from this author.
B000001ESJ|4|Arrived on time. It was a gift for my husband and he liked it.
B00P42WROG|5|While closer to the likes of Patterson's formulaic chart-toppers than his other work, veteran readers will find King's sarcastic, sick drawl in every word of Finders Keepers. No one is better at writing a villain than King; his capacity to imagine the truly grotesque mind is astounding.
B00HDMMISA|2|Never made it past page 100.  I just found it to be a soap opera in book form with cliche characters and an uninteresting plot line.
B00DPM7TIG|5|The characters were vividly portrayed and the plot was enthralling.
B009O2XY12|5|Enjoy playing it
B008HK3XU4|5|Fits perfectly, looks good and protects my Kindle.  Has all the features of a more expensive model and a fraction of the price.
0451160916|5|What I like about this book, as with all his other books is the incredible ambiguity that Steven King is able to give to his characters. They come across as multidimensional, real people. Also, I like how he keeps interspersing their thoughts with the descriptions of the environment and  the passing actions. It gives it a soothing dreamlike, feel. The shining is  one of my favorites. It's a terrifying story,and very well written. I liked  the T.V. series better than the movie with Jack Nicholson. But the movie  had a more intense, terrifying feel to it. I watched it when I was ten and  it scared me to death.
9382951008|5|Received this book promptly.  Have read all his books and none are disappointing.  Also mentions a local city and familiar places.  Good quality.  A wonderful story of the human heart condition.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|DONT BUY.<br /> Horr
B00G3L6KQI|5|The book of life is an amazing conclusion to the all souls trilogy. It neatly ties up the loose ends left by shadow of night and leaves the reader with a comforting sense of completion. Deborah Harkness is a brilliant author, deftly weaving a wondrous story full of romance, adventure, science and history.
B00HDMMISA|5|An excellent book!  I love reading Liane Moriarty books.  She is a wonderful author and is so gifted with words. She has a great talent, I just loaded \\"what Alice forgot\\".  I can't wait to get started.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I think this is the best game I ever got. I totally recommend this game to anyone out there.
B000XUBFE2|5|It took me three tries to read this book, it was just so sad! But I learned so much as I pushed my way through it. It is a book I will read many times, in sure.
0871137380|5|From the beginning, this new found information was hard hitting, I could not put the book down. A must read for the military and recommended for politicians every where. God Bless you Rangers, thanks for your sacrifice.  &quot; Freedom has a flavor that the protected shall never know&quot;.
0767919408|5|Think the USA is not exceptional? In a very fact filled and humourous book Bryson nails it. Because we Americans never give up and are free to fail over and over again. One Summer will have you thinking &#34;this cannot be true.&#34; But as usual truth and life are stranger than fiction. Learn how we got to be &#34;exceptional&#34; if you enjoy history, you will love this book.
B00R7FZ074|5|The Imitation Game was well done with great acting
B001OGWY1W|5|I was amazed the first time I saw it on opening day, have watched it dozens of times since. Glad that I have a digital copy to watch on my iPad.
B00BMT9C84|4|I can't believe she ate the whole meal.  You have to be attentive or you can miss the story line. Good chemistry between mom and son.

B000683VI4|5|In \\"The Notebook\\", James Garner plays \\"Duke\\", who is bound-and-determined  to spend as much time as possible reading from a notebook to Gena Rowland,  a patient in a nursing home suffering from progressive alzheimers, where lucid  awareness is off-and-on.  \\"Bound-and-determined\\" means all-the-time, including off-hours for visitors. But  Duke doesn't let that stand in his way, as he uses plenty of that old  Maverick/Rockford fanagling and charm to get around the staff who are trying to  stop him; although some members of the staff are unable to resist, and are cool  with it.  What is Duke's obsession with reading from that notebook to her all the time? That  notebook has a special magic all it's own, which is obviously the crux of this movie.  And being that I very much want you to see \\"The Notebook\\", that's all you get from  this review.  Except that you will never be the same after you watch this movie.  In a prolific acting career that has spanned more than 60 years...there is not a doubt  in my mind, that \\"The Notebook\\" is the greatest, and most important role, that was  ever played by the great James Garner.  See ya 'round, Maverick.
B000HIVO64|4|I felt OK writing a review on release day because Beck was leaking videos and other new tracks on his myspace page for a month or two before.  I appreciated that and because of it, I must admit that I cannot remember the last time I was so eager for an album to come out.  That being said, I definitely have favorites already.  They include:    \\"Elevator Music\\" - very danceable tune, should have been the 1st single.    \\"Soldier Jane\\" - constant head bobbing, (important for me after Guerolito) definitely has some psychedelic qualities; I like the synths here.    \\"Dark Star\\" - I have never done acid, but the media has convinced me it must be something like this.  Cool song and by far the best video on the DVD.  It is as if Stanley Kubrick directed the video laced to early 80s underground beats.  One person commented that Beck resembles Willy Wonka a bit here.    \\"We Dance Alone\\" - I just added this one because it caught on with me after a while.  This is probably a song that showcases Beck's eclecticism more than any other, many different things going on here.    \\"No complaints\\" - Very catchy; one of the most stripped down tracks on the album, perfect for the MP3 player, walking outside.  Great lyrics.    \\"The Information\\" - The title track has a hard bass beat and is solid overall.    The last song is a montage of a couple different tracks, focusing on change.   This album was marketed different from the others; Beck is telling us the music is changing.  Example: I went out and bought it rather than downloading this . . . Why?    Partly because of the DVD that comes with the album, partly the releases on myspace.  Brilliant marketing focusing more on the album as a package.  And I'm still split on rating it vs. Guero.  Even though there were some tracks I could do without, (e.g. - Motorcade) when rating this album you have to keep in mind that Beck made a video for every song.  Has anyone done that before???  And then NOT charge us a lot for it?  At well under $15 here, this is a bargain for an album with 15 tracks and 15 videos on DVD.    I could go on about the stickers, but I won't.  Beck has attempted something different and I liked it, hope you do too.  Let's watch if the rest of the music industry follows suit.
0553573403|5|when you pick up this book. I found it fascinating,delectable and mostly riveting! Martin kept my attention the whole book and I had to force myself to put it down. It is well conceived and written. This one will keep up at night. ....The down side if there is one, is the number of characters. There is an Appendix that has the different Lords houses listed and who is related to whom. That is very helpful.
B00003CXIY|5|It has a great plot with a great cast and it kept me entertained, held my interest and it was very funny.
B00HHJPUFM|5|Very cute
B008673ZAQ|5|Just like Gideon, I'm having a hard time finding the words that express how much I loved this book.  I adored the first book, but Reflected in You blew me away.  Best book series ever.  My only complaint is that it is too cruel making us wait until December for the third book.
B00NLBJ45M|5|Great graphics, interesting story, not too hard, not too easy, just right. Recommend. Especially while it is on sale. I would never pay 4.99, but .99 is about right. Get it while the sale lasts.
B008Y6U5AM|2|Not my kind of movie....can't imagine it could be anyone's!
0425263916|4|Like everybody else in America I read 50 Shades years ago, so I bought this trilogy for fun.  I had never heard of Sylvia Day or the Crossfire Series.  I don't even know how I came across it.  My first impression was, really.... could you mirror 50 shades more?  But I liked it and will read the 4th book.  so I guess it's not a Trilogy.
B00HV8TN7K|2|It's ok
B002SF9YUM|5|THE MOVIE WAS VERY WELL DIRECTED,THE ACTORS WERE INCREDIBLE IN THEIR ROLLES. THOUGH THE SUBJECT MATTER MIGHT BE SLIGHT FOR SOME IT IS A PIECE OF HISTORY. IT WAS AUTHENTICALLY PORTRAID, WITH GREAT TASTE WIT AND SENSITIVITY. I WAS WARY AT FIRST, BUT TRULLY AMAZED. I WAS TRULLY ENTERTAINED, THANK YOU FOR THE GRATE PREFORMANCE, OF ROBERT PATTINSSON AND MATHEW McNULTY!!!
B00B99QTM4|5|Classic, funny, love this movie and watched it over and over for years!
B007SGM084|5|Did not want it to end!!!
B00OALBUZY|5|Loved the movie
B00JCW0BCY|5|I will gift this book to my adult children knowing that together we will be prepared to travel through my final days in an informed and loving way.
0345535529|5|He's the Tolkein of our time, best book series hands down...
B00BAXFECK|5|I wasn't sure if this book was for me, but chose it because of the ratings.  I read it in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  I loved the main character with all of his flaws.  It was a great read.
B000OZ0NXA|5|Excellent book, keeps your interest to the very end
B006KX3GXO|5|LOVE THIS APP!!!!!<br />best app u could ever get<br />my family loves this app<br />fun play it evdryday<br />#1 app to me
B00AYXNKIC|3|The game is fine. Graphics are good. However, I'm so tired of everything getting a &#34;Social&#34; link to it. I don't want to play with other people. If I did I'd go outside and do it. I gave it 3 stars for making me have to skip the (play against) page.
B0044XV3QY|4|I received the disc very quickly. The product arrived in excellent condition. I would use this company again. Excellent movie.
B001GJ1BBQ|2|While this genre of movie requires you to suspend logic and reality, you can only stretch that so far when coupled with bad acting from some good actors.
B004MC8CA2|5|It's been a while since having my daily devotional, even longer since attending church, but this app is getting me back on track.<br /><br />You will quickly appreciate the remarkable convenience of receiving a daily passage of scripture, displayed on schedule.<br /><br />It's nice when at work, having a rough day then all of a sudden my phone will play that familiar notification and I will spend a couple of minutes being reminded of my loving Savior and what is truly important.<br /><br />Besides the passages, this app offers a ridiculous number of devotionals and schedules to help you read through the whole Bible or your testament of choice. I highly recommend the New Testament, there a few good things in there ;-)<br /><br />Not to mention they offer any and every version of the Bible imaginable so you will be comfortable reading it whether you prefer NIV, KJV or any one of the myriad of other options available.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor by grabbing this wonderful app and notice how even after a few days the degree to which it helps to keep you on track and closer to Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior!
B009NPKTN6|1|The story is corny and predictable.  Acting doesn't rise up beyond the material except for Tom Cruise who takes his best stab at Axel Rose.  Alec Baldwin is funny solely because he seems to know what a mess it is and doesn't take it too seriously.  the soundtrack mashes together a bunch of songs that only makes them seem sappy.  Avoid.
B00DYOOGYK|1|Game doesn't start...:(
0399230033|5|Such a great book to giggle over with your little ones. I discovered it when my youngest was little, and as an educator, I love that it can be enjoyed by all. It's one I buy for all the children in my life.
B0032CVAQQ|5|I have always been a skeptic about receiving relationship help from anyone else because no one has really been there to guide me so I always think my choice is best. After reading this book- in four hours- I am much more open to the advice from others. This not only taught me how to successfully show my love to someone who I truly want to spend the rest of my life with, but helped me understand how he shows his love to me although I may not have saw it before because I never understood my own love language. This is an eye-opening, life-changing lesson and a must read for all regardless of age or relationship status. The words spoken in this book will change anyone's outlook on how they love another forever. Thank you Gary Chapman for giving me the opportunity to pull out of an empty life full of stress and hatred and open up to discovering one of happiness and joy where my tank can always be full. As the title says I am just saying, and even though I feel he is the one, if he isn't I will encourage- not force- all future partners to read this book. Keep in mind: when one reads this they must not just look at the words. For you to really understand it you need to accept it as the truth and focus it towards your life personally and those in it to really get the full value of what Mr. Chapman is attempting to convey. If this is done, I too believe this world will pull out of the broken homes and jump into what should be- happy homes and happy couples filled with love for one another.
B000Y0Q5NM|5|I gave this a 5 star rating as this was one of my favorite episodes of this series. I'm a subscriber to a different instant streaming site that rotates their instant selection of shows. So it was great that I was able to purchase just the episode that I had an urge to re-watch. Great sound & video quality.
B002JVWQSW|5|This is the very best comedy on TV at this point in time...PERIOD. The cast is absolutely top shelf. Also, it is extremely rare find such outstanding chemistry between the artists.     The younger cast members deserve particular recognition here. Let's start with Sarah Hyland (Haley), outstanding acting talent. Has anybody noticed when she smiles she is exactly like a young Natalie Wood? Ariel Winter (Alex) she brilliantly embodies the awkwark and frustrated middle sibbling. Nolan Gould (Luke) does a terrific job as the youngest child in the zoo.     My best review is reserved for Rico Rodriguez (Manny). He is outstanding. In fact, I would say award worthy. This kid has the acting talent and professional bearing to bring a multi fasceted and complex child to life. \\"Manny\\" is caught in the middle between dads and cultures. He manages to bring the humorous side of his life situation through at just the right moments. Very genuine. Congradulations Rico, you have earned praise for your work.    The rest of the cast is just as good. I just wanted to take the time and recognize the work of these fine actors.    Finally, none of the reviews on this page would be singing the praises of this television series if it were not for the outstanding work of it's writers. I beg, I entreat you, to please keep this group together as they clearly have developed continuity and depth with their characters. The ability to do this and seemlessly integrate them into a storyline is very rare indeed. Hopefully it is the precurser for many deserved awards to come.    Directors, please receive my compliments for successfully bringing it all together.    The moment the DVD comes out, it's mine. Congradulations guys for producing such a great, funny, entertaining and relevant show that has all of us awaiting the next installment.
B00CT2P6VA|5|Most beautiful so far, most twists and added challenges that are always in that happy medium of not too easy and not too hard. Respect to Amazon, as I've been waiting for this game to release in almost a year and it's not of Google Play at all yet!
B0036S4B6M|1|How some genius was able to work magic and turn this long winded and UN exciting book into a phenomenal, witty, clever tv series is beyond me. The subject matter itself is definitely interesting but the writing is painfully devoid of any humor or imagination. Rather than draw you into a day in the life of Piper, the author simply tells you about it; scant dialogue and cursory mentions of character  backgrounds prevent you from connecting with anyone. Reading this book was like being at a party with the worst story teller EVER who actually sucks the life out of the most interesting events. I never would have finished this book of I hadn't seen the series and had hope that the tone might change and illicit a smile or chuckle...nope. boring till the very end.
B005K17RU0|5|Am enjoying AccuWeather as it is very complete.  Also, it gives a month of predictions and it is very easy to read.
B004GJDQT8|5|Great products and services
B00ID4I6LA|2|At the end of this, I felt like sending a small check to Harrision Ford with a note saying &#34;You obviously need this money more than I do.&#34;  I don't understand how he could have read the script and thought that this would be a good career move.  The story's premise is laughable (only children are able to process information fast enough to defeat the aliens??).  The poor young actor playing the lead seems unable to grasp the directors vision (if there was one), and plays the whole movie like a grimly determined 40-year-old in a 14-year-old's body.  Harrison Ford seems like he's in some other movie, and Ben Kingsley...well, all I can say is he would have wept the night he won the Oscar if he could've looked into the future to see himself flailing around in this dreck.  I gave it two stars rather than one because 1) it's benign in that it contains no offensive material, and 2) the special effects were OK.  Don't waste your money; spend it on something useful like an enema or a root canal.
B003WUYRGI|5|I mean it's a dictionary and very informative. There's really not much I can say about it.  I guess I approve.
B000VX1CI0|5|Love them!!!
0553801503|4|10-29-06 <br />First of all, let me start by saying that I'm addicted to Robert Jordan books because I need something to put me to sleep at night (LOL), and George's Fire & Ice series just manages to keep me awake. Oh well, you can't have it all I suppose. You see it takes me a year to get through a Jordan book (one paragraph and I'm falling asleep), but takes me a week to get through Martin's books. Hmmm...which book gives me my money's worth? <br /> <br />EVEN SO, this book slowed the pace a little in the series for obvious reasons, that Martin did explain (no I don't want to spell it out for you-just read the stinking book). <br /> <br />But even though it slowed down, that just doesn't bother me, I mean he's only at book 4 people. Give him a break. Where's Jordan at...book 11 !!!!! Plus a worthless \\"prequel\\"!!!! There's no denying that George has covered far more significant ground, literally written circles around Jordan with far more depth and realism, and plot. <br /> <br />I wonder who's actually making more money, Martin or Jordan? But Jordan is obviously ripping people off - and probably being very smug about it. <br />  <br />None of George's books prattle on about mindless meaningless detail (as does Jordan...ceaselessly & shamelessly going on about Tar Valon and what one sister thought about another, blah blah - I just find myself wanting the Dark One to escape and destroy them all). <br /> <br />But in Martin's 4th book, I do suppose I was getting a little tired of Jamie and his sick sister, (and their whole family for that matter) but was very glad to see how it came out in the end (only it isn't quite the end is it?). <br /> <br />But it's like, George has all the different factions and such, and family history, and culture, and you have to admit, the characters are all believable, as crazy as it sounds. The evil are believably ruthless, and the good are not ridiculously good, and there's definitely no shallow characters here - all have depth, even the hedge knights (nice touch George). Touche'! <br /> <br />BUT GET BACK TO WORK!!! I'm tired of waiting for the next installment!
B00SH04286|1|Dumb!
B0066WJLU6|5|I love having this app on my phone.  I keep my phone next to my bed at night and if I have to get up I take it with as a flashlight so I don't fall or bump into things.  I also love having it for things that fall under my desk at work.  It's just a great little tool.
B000ICLRIE|5|Exactly as Advertised!

B001706I5I|5|My kids loooooooveee this movie. I will definitely have to buy it next year. Jim Carry is soooo funny. we watched it twice during the 24 hr rental
B0000028RR|5|Amazing.<br /><br />Thats it.<br /><br />Just listen to this god damned thing, its flipping ridiculous its so good. How come these guys aren't around no more, this stuff was AWESOME! I believe this came out in '92 which makes it sound even more crazy, are these guys credited with starting rap metal? So good LOUD ANGRY MEATY sounds come out of these guys, all natural, no synthetics (nope, they just know how to do insane things with the instruments.)<br /><br />Sure the band is still around as AUDIOSLAVE, but that stuff doesn't compare a bit. Where the hell is ZACH DE LAROCHA, I heard he was doing a solo?<br /><br />You need to own this classic. Every song a keeper<br /><br />GET iT, PLAY IT and TEAR SOME SH*T UP!
B000LC55F2|5|At the beginning of the movie we learn that magicians view their tricks as three act plays, The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  This movie is also presented in this way.  We learn about two young apprentice magicians who are friends.  Both live in poor circumstances, but they have very different characters.  Christian Bale plays Alfred Bordon, who is the more talented of the two, but is hurt as a magician because of his misanthropic personality.  He is less charismatic and less able to connect with the audience than the more flamboyant Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />The story is not told lienearly and doesn't explain much about when we are jumping forward and backwards.  It more or less unfolds in its own way and you pick up bits and pieces and try to add them to what you have been told.  The point being is that you are never sure if you have stuck this new bit of info in the right place or are even seeing it the right way.<br /><br />Something goes horribly wrong during one dangerous trick and this sets off a more than bitter rivalry between the two men.  Of course, as things escalate between the two there are bystanders taken into the vortex of their attempts at mutual professional (and physical) destruction.<br /><br />David Bowie does a very interesting turn as Nikola Tesla, who really did live in Colorado Springs at the time the movie is set, and did have a huge magnifying transmitter in his laboratory that is also shown in the movie.  A powerful visual image.  How he becomes involved in the lives of the protagonists, I will leave to the movie to explain to you.<br /><br />Even if you think you have figured out the main punch line of the movie, the actual Prestige of the final act is not likely be what you think it is.  In fact, it has multiple layers.<br /><br />Enjoy it.  Fine performances are given throughout, especially by the women drawn into their lives to their eventual sorrow.  They are Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson.  And of course, Michael Caine is the anchor of the whole thing and plays his role with perfection.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.Scarlett Johansson.

B007FEFLTO|5|Over the years Ken Follett has written dozens of amazing books.  Like legions of others, I was consumed by Pillars of the Earth.  I thought I would never find another that would come close.  Then I read World Without End - even better because it told me more about the lives of the people in medieval England.  Again, I wondered when I would find another that was so enthralling.  Needless to say, I enjoyed The Fall of Giants that portrayed the lives of five very different and interesting families caught up in the events all over Europe during the World War I era. Just when I thought I couldn't wait any longer for another &#34;Follett Fix&#34; I pre-ordered Winter of the World.  From the first pages I could see how he was going to bring those same five families back into the story.  This book was an amazing accomplishment in terms of it range and scope. Follett continues to be a master storyteller. Now - how long do I have to wait for the third book in the trilogy?

0879309210|4|It's a classic repair book, but for a reader with average mechanical skills it's a bit too verbose at points.  Just tell me how to fix something - I don't need a history lesson, or 20 different alternate ways to accomplish a task.<br /><br />For all of that, it's a very good resource that will pay for itself with one neck set-up, pot replacement, or similar repair.

One thing:  we usually turn off the volume, as the music is monotonous.

B00H8C41XA|4|Acting was very good. The story was okay. Entertaining but not great. Oprah did a nice job in this one.
B0011FXLCC|3|This is another departure for Goldfrapp. Felt mountain was in my opinion unlistenable stuff, while Black Cherry and Supernature were on the verge of greatness. Here she takes a step back away from the lectronica of these two albums and produces an album of dreamy songs. It has been described as psychedelic but I am not so sure that does apply. I feared a lot from the reviews but it is not that bad. It is however surprisingly \\"commercial\\" sounding for an artist or band of this type. She will undoubtedly lose a great part of the fans who liked the glammy techno of the last record. One positive point is that she is trying to renew her approach but I am not sure this is the right direction.
B00AKKGX4W|5|Wonderful story about childhood emotions swaying ones adult life and the adult emotions as well. The weaving of the story is captivating, causing the reader to read, read until the end.

B0000AQS0F|5|I have always been a big Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan.  In brief, Firefly/ Serenity is the best Sci-Fi that I have ever seen.  It is an extremely satisfying and well-rounded premise.  It is well written and very believable.  If you like Sci-Fi, Western, Drama and Comedy, or just a good story with great writing, I highly recommend you buy this series.  I guarentee that you won't be disappointed!
B00000K19E|5|I don't need to talk about the plot, as everyone knows what it's about. The Matrix is a classic though because it's the first movie that really has the bullet time shooting/dodging effect and has some absolutley brilliant martial art fighting scenes. The first time you see the slo mo stuff, you'll know that this is some cool stuff. It blends sci-fi and martial arts and ends up making a classic movie that is the first of a a kind. This one isn't boring and weird like a lot of parts in the sequels and instead has a compelling story, a unique plot and some absolutely wicked cool fighting. Watch this one, if you haven't already, because it's a one of a kind movie.

B001FB5634|2|What a disappointment. Viggo is an amazing actor in everything he does, but unfortunately even he couldnt pull this movie out of the muck. The movie left me with many questions. How did they survive? Where are they going? Why would they leave a super stockpile of supplies behind? Why did that kid have to be so repetitive and annoying ;(Papa, papa?, are we still the good guys?). You would think that he would have had a much better vocabulary for a kid of atleast 12, and be much less of a sissy boy. Where are the books? Why arent they evolving? We must have fast-forwarded over an an hour of the movie, and still wanted our time back for the bit we did see.
B0031RS4UM|2|Glad this wasn't my first Reacher, it would have put me off the series. Later books get better. In this one, Reachers persona is not developed at all. Tedious and endless descriptions of military paraphenalia, coincidences that just keep on stacking up. Weak ending.

B00005JO20|3|What a lovely 90 minute film that lies within these 187 minutes......  To me the 2005 film only works when it sticks close to the original of 1933. The cast is great though, but sadly Kong is just one of many monsters on the island and the most exciting scene is the escape from frightened dinosaurs....  The excape from the insects were cut in 1933 because it took attention from Kong. Why didn`t they learn???<br /><br />In 1976 Kong is a great beast with almost human qualities - sort of a missing link. Here he is back being a gorilla of oversize and it is a puzzle why Ann is not killed by his rough treatment of her early on. The Jimmy-Hayes relationship goes nowhere and they could easily have been omitted.<br /><br />The 1976 film has great locations, while this is a blue-screen effort and u see it much too often. I mean several cliffs and stones in the shape of a gorilla?  It's  enough with Skull island... Ann`s vaudeville tricks and their Bambi-moment in New York is BAAAAAAAAAAD...  The New York sequences should have been better, but the Empire State Buidling-scene survives...<br /><br />The sacrifising of Ann is both good in 33 and 76, here - it's dramatic, but the first sight of Kong is just shadow.......And magical moments are far between because Jackson doesn`t dare to slow down...<br /><br />In the 1976 film we get to love Kong....  Here... well we don`t....  It`s a great actioner, but I wish Jackson could have relaxed a bit.... It's funny the way Denham refers to Fay Wray early on(\\"but she`s shooting over at RKO\\")<br /><br />Many people feel Kong is a racist. But that`s insane... Of course he warms up to a whiteperson - she`s a novelty - a new thing to him..... He is just curious and collects her as a prized possession.<br /><br />But it is an OK contribution to the myth of Kong. It's NOT the best Kong, but it's OK in a trilogy of the giant....
B007I2BZIE|5|There is ALWAYS something familiar about RUSH to Rush fans especially; but this time it is very familiar...the idea of a concept album (that they said they would not do again).  Geddy's vocals like them or not,(more on this in a bit)Peart's unmistakable percussion..Alex's timely guitar playing...yet...as familiar as it is \\"Clockwork Angels is as fresh as when they began.  This is perhaps one of their greatest disks yet!<br /><br />Firstoff, I need to say, Geddy Lee can sing!  And he sings very well...on this disk he does exactly what he wants with his voice exactly when he needs to....some people do not like the tone quallity of his voice and that's fine...whatever...I don't like opera, doesn't mean Rene Flemming can't sing. (he just compared Geddy Lee to Rene Flemming!  Oh no he didn't!!!!) Bottom line is the voice is one of Ged's instruments and as a musician, you need to have control of your instrument; WHATEVER that is.....and he does.....so all the haters can go home....or...in the words of Stephen A. \\"Just Stop it\\"!<br /><br />Back to \\"Angels\\":<br /><br />The typical RUSH virtuosity is really restrained throughout most of the album.  A lot of it occurs in the 1st piece \\"Caravan\\" which by the way is a remix of the one released last year; as is BU2B.  RUSH fans already know these are both outstanding pieces.<br />So if you bought those last year, in the album you aren't getting the exact same thing....although the differences are subtle.  Bottom line is they are both great additions to the RUSH repertoire.  The title cut follows that and is really what RUSH has always been about.....longer pieces that don't seem long and when they are over you want more! At this point somethings started to stand out; 1) Although a concept album, it's still cut up into individual pieces (which is not unlike RUSH) but as the entire album is the story, it's a bit different (2112 was one side, so was Hemispheres) 2) the song writing is the main focus, not necessarily the concept...there are very few musical themes on the album that popup anywhere else; this to me is one thing I would have liked to have seen, but it takes nothing away. 3) Rush is still exploring with sounds and technique....the use of virbrato in several songs is an example as they use it more on this album that they have in all of their albums put together.<br /><br />The next 2 pieces could have been on many of RUSH's previous albums....\\"Anarchist\\" and \\"Carnies\\"  show equal quality of songwriting and again, Rush forgoes vituostic soloing for the sake of the songwriting; they could have done more...but they were restraineed...and it doesn't hurt the song one bit...mostly because everything the do is STILL virtuostic by most standards.  Another thing the resist on this album is their tendancy to throw in a midsong solo break in 7/8 or some other odd time signatures.  Personally, I did miss that part!  But, again, I don't think it hurts the compositions at all.<br /><br />In a few places it seemed to make room for David Campbell's string arrangements which are absolutely brilliant in the way they fit in and put the songs over the top.  This also points to perhaps a next direction for RUSH as David Campbell was the arranger of the Sydney Austrailia Symphony Orchestra for the outstanding \\"KISSYMPHONY\\" concert.....How about a RUSH tour or even one off show with and orchestra?  Just a thought...<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Halo Effect\\" shows that softer side of RUSH we dont often see but they can be really great at.  \\"7 Cities Of Gold\\" is again a reminder of Rush at their best with heavy riffs and wailing vocals. The next song starts off with almost 60's sounding guitar chords and a Keith Moon like beat...then continues in a very melodic way again with a cathchy melody I couldn't stop singing....Not what I expected from a song called \\"The Wreckers\\"<br /><br />\\"Headlong Flight\\" is again, Rush doing what they do ...or did.....it is a VERY familiar tip of the cap towards themselves in the early days....you can hear bits of \\"Bastille Day\\" and \\"Working Man\\"<br />Listen to this one a high volume...you'll thank me later.<br /><br />BU2B2: is RUSH's version of a Sgt Pepper Reprise; but more like the end of 2112; it sets you up for a sad ending.....\\"Life Goes From Bad To Worse\\"......but this is RUSH 'now'...so right away they follow with;  all the you can do is \\"Wish Them Well\\"...this disk could have ended with \\"Headlong Flight\\"....but the RUSH philosophical words of wisdom need to be imparted...this of course concludes in totally atypical RUSH fashion with the beautiful 'ballad' \\"The Garden\\"....in which they leave you with the words I hope all of you take to heart; \\" The measure of a life, is a measure of love and respect; so hard to earn, so easily burned\\"....hold onto that!<br /><br />The one constant thing that always amazes me is how they manage to turn a strange melody with atypical words into a singable catchphrase; much like a chorus (but calling it that seems to cheapen RUSH)...<br />ex. \\"Clockwork Angels. spread their arms and sing; sychronized and graceful, they move like living things\\", or \\"A wheel of fate, A Game of Chance\\"...or \\" I have stoked the fire of the big steel wheels, steer the airship right across the skies.....\\"...Really...who writes stuff like that AND makes it so you want to know the words so you can sing along!  Only RUSH!<br /><br />Fantastic piece of work!  BRAVO!

0316666343|5|Lovely Bones is one of the best books I have ever read.  It may seem a little depressing or awful but in reality it's an inspiring book filled with hope and joy.  It's one of those books that you wished you'd read before because it really changes the way you see life and the people around you. It also leaves you with a feeling that maybe what you're going through isn't so bad and there's a lot more good in the world than you see. I recommend Lovely Bones to anyone who just wants to read a good book, it's more than worth the time.  Plus you'll finish faster than you think because Susie's story is so compelling you won't be able to put it down.
B00BAVCD8A|1|This album should be titled save pop music like Maroon 5 instead, the title is an insult and disgrace to real rock music. If the title wasn't so pretentious I would have left it alone. I have nothing against pop music but People who listen to real rock and roll bands like led zeppelin, tool, Metallica, deftones, pink Floyd, nine inch nails, the clash, the misfits, jimi Hendrix, mastodon, radiohead, rancid, old weezer albums, rage against the machine,the doors, guns and roses, nirvana, soundgarden, and more will tell you this band is for all the young screamo pop kids. Fallout boy's music has no balls, no grittiness, lame vocals, over-produced, is poppy sounding, no rawness, lacks soul and energy, sounds like pre teen zit infested angst. Fallout boy is not even remotely close to being on the same level as rock.fallout boy does not fall in line with the evolution of rock. This music sounds horrible and weak and their sound and popularity is why rock is dead. The poppy weak vocal sounds so annoyingly horrible, it's hard to understand why anybody listens to this mess other than they are jr high and high school kids who have never really been exposed to real rock music. These kids need to reeducate themselves and pick up on real rock instead, they'll never go back to fallout boy guaranteed! If fallout boy is how people define rock music, rock is dead.

B009OA57MI|5|I'm  happy with this game. I use a 100 dollar after-market internet tablet with 1.2 gig processer and the game runs flawlessly. I really enjoy military flight simulaters and this game is good and realistic. Some things I've noticed is there is no dog fighting, you only have two missiles to choose from, no flir targeting systems, and you have to have the target on your HUD display to be able to lock on and fire. But that is no problem for me. I like using my tablet as the joy stick and it works great. Good practice if you like taking of from base, staging an aerial invasion and returning to your aircraft carrier for landing.

1592402690|5|If you're the kind of Beatle fan that love discussing not only about their lives and accomplishments, but also getting down to the technical aspects involved in the creation of their revolutionary music, this is A MUST ONE to have.    Reading it is a very enjoyable experience, especially when it comes down to the explanation of the tricks they had to do in the then pre-historic technology (but still, great) Abbey Road studio to generate and record the very special sonic wishes of the Beatles.    The book itself made me realize (this time for sure) that Geoff Emerick is, really, the co-producer of Revolver and Pepper. And that means a lot!
B001BWYTAS|2|Less than one hour, this recent documentary has a few interviews with the little people such as fans and locals who recall the 1967 fiasco of Magical Mystery Tour, a Paul creation done in the immediate wake of Brian Epstein's death a month before. There is no actual Beatles music here, just muzak instrumentals of the soundtrack songs. There is a fair amount of cutting room stuff of the group on this fall 1967 jaunt around the south of England, but very little actual soundtrack material, aside from a couple of radio interviews done at the time. Spencer Davis and the guy from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band reminisce a bit, as does Mike McCartney. Victor Spinetti narrates. Because of licensing, there is no footage or music from the rarely seen film itself, which makes this product of interest to Beatles completists only.

B004J4WKUQ|2|This book is basically a retrospective look at 80s pop culture, especially the early arcade video games -- Pac-Man, Joust, Adventure, all the great classics, plus some lesser-known gems. These cultural artifacts are described in tender detail, and the author's love for them practically shines through the pages. I enjoyed those aspects of the book a great deal.    Unfortunately, the book falls flat as an actual fictional narrative. The pacing is a bit awkward. There is virtually no character development, and the characters themselves are flat. The protagonist is one step away from being a Mary Sue (or a Marty Stu, rather), though he takes turns between performing heroic deeds and expositing at the reader. There's at least one instance of Deus Ex Machina which helps speed the characters through plot (such as it is). There is some foreshadowing that fizzles into predictable cliches. In the end, the world is saved after a suitably pyrotechnic boss battle, and all is well.     In fact, this book reads as though it was written by its protagonist: someone who is much more familiar with games than with people. If this book was a documentary, it may be excellent; as a fiction book, it is below average.

B00DPM7TIG|5|I could not put it down and was impressed by the authenticity of the time period.
0060005424|3|I loved \\"Sabriel.\\" Loved it.  Rushed out and bought the other two books in the series, but after finishing \\"Lirael\\" I can honestly say I don't know if I'll bother more than skimming the last book.<br /><br />The story of Lirael is wonderful.  Interesting, absorbing, with great world-building.  Sameth, however, is a drag. I wound up skimming his part of the narrative, because I found him boring, petulant, weak, and uninteresting.  My disconnect with the story-line in the Sameth parts further led to a growing impatience with the writing, which in the main is no more than adequate.  Perhaps I have too-high expectations of young-adult fantasy (but having read a great deal of it, I don't think that's it). The repetition became tedious.  We KNOW Sam is afraid of death and the necromancer Hedge. We KNOW he is afraid to venture into Death. We KNOW Lirael wants the Sight and wants to feel like a true Daughter of the Clayr.  The 750-thousandth time it's repeated?  Gets a bit old.  Shame on the editors for allowing the book to go on for 600 pages, when at least the second part of the story could have been cropped down to a faster pace by just leaving out all the repetative whining the two characters do, and most especially Sameth.<br /><br />And at the end, when suddenly everyone is telling Sam he's not a coward?  I threw the book across the room.  he spends the entire book being a coward, and then at the end, I'm supposed to believe he's a hero?  How stupid are young adults supposed to be, here?<br /><br />I'm still giving the book three stars because I did love the story of Lirael in the glacier, and I love the world that Nix built, though I'm disappointed here at his mediocre writing.  \\"Sabriel\\" sucked me in at the first two chapters and kept me there.  \\"Lirael\\" had me, and lost me when it departed from her story to cover the spoiled and weak Prince Sameth.<br /><br />Read the first book, but don't expect the second one to touch it.

B00005JNTX|4|Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development. Although \\"Sin City\\" is not a complete exception, it is a stand out from other \\"click, click, boom\\" action movies.<br /><br />The movie comprises of interlocking stories throughout involving different characters. These stories aren't like \\"Seinfeld\\" where each of them dose something different that somehow relates to each other and everything is resolved at the end. Much like the story telling of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", the movie is shown out of sequence, to relate with each character's segment.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is what stood out for me. Excellent performances by Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood, who gives one of the most creepiest villain performances I've seen, without uttering a word.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. Not only did he co-direct the movie, he \\"shot and cut\\" it (yes that is an actual credit, just look at the back of the DVD) and directed the music as well. I guess when he made a movie over a decade ago with a $7,000 dollar budget, he knows how to do different jobs.<br /><br />The only fault in \\"Sin City\\" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters. When one dies, and many do, you don't have such a strong feeling as you would, say if the movie surrounded one character. The only \\"main\\" character seemed to be Bruce Willis. Yes he seems to be reprising his role from \\"Die Hard\\", but he dose it well, and for me was the one of the only characters you cared about.<br /><br />Final thought: The movie is not as violent as you are lead to believe. Kill Bill or the Matrix was more violent than Sin City, but the violence is in a \\"comic book style\\", and to sum up what that means here, the blood is almost entirely white...
0062409859|1|I could not wait to get through it and would have trashed it if I had not liked To Kill a Mockingbird.  Disappointing and it should not have been published, imo.
B00DEFW998|4|this is a lovely cd, with nice fusion of  styles and traditions.  includes music from Norah Jones, Shankar's half-sister.  some of it is very  Indian, which style  may not appeal to everyone.  wonderful, famous musicians, in addition  to Shankar,  accompany the voices. &#34;traces of you&#34; probably refers to Ravi Shankar, the late father of both  women.

B00F9UOH50|1|The app can be good with proper updates for photos, but there no need for some of the permissions u see here, even paid apps I got seem not really too be mine especially when u need WiFi for all most everything now. Last week them big storms in the northeast had my power out, now I figure not having much to do I play some games or apps I like,,, well all of them now need WiFi and could play apps I paid for without it. There's just to much permissions anymore and it ant rite, these reviews are to be by us for us too inform each other if it's good or not , or any problems the apps may be having .<br /><br />Am just tired of all ways having too check my running in the back round to force stop things that shouldn't be running, were the consumers to not pay for anything that invades our personal information.

B00001IVOF|5|havoc's production zenith - prodigy in his absolute prime (drop a gem!) - outstanding
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great technology for those that don't want to have to connect another horde of wires or transfer their files to other media to watch on their television.  Highly recommended.
0061950726|5|Excellent read!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|WOW! I scored this when it was on sale recently, and now I'm getting ready to buy a couple more, plus some as Christmas presents! This thing immediately transformed my several-year-old LCD into a smart TV, and couldn't be any easier to set up and use. Even if there isn't a specific App for something, whatever is on your screen can be cast to the TV. Now I can bring up Xfinity TV Go on my phone, and watch shows in the bedroom where I don't have a digital cable box or a newer smart TV. This thing rocks, and belongs in every TV in the house! Since you can name each one, it's simple to cast to the correct device in the applicable room.

B00NCGXYJS|5|A trip back in time...Bette Midler's does a wonderful job in bringing back this great music from the 50's! LOVE IT!!!
B0000024K1|5|Public Enemy's _It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back_ Is the music equivelent to getting punched in the face. Every song on this album is classic. Chick D's rhymes are so powerful that you just sit back and go \\"wow, what was that\\" add to that Flavor Flav's clowning and The Bomb Squads revolutionary production. The result is a landmark album not just in Rap/Hip-Hop but in all of music.

B00003CXDG|3|Having built the pre release hype upto dizzying levels through numerous teasers and the fact that action meister John Woo was directing we were all  in for a bit of a treat. <br />I found myself being quite impressed with the  slick opening sequence, yep we've got ourselves a nasty piece of work bad  guy (Dougray Scott) who likes to make a scene by crashing a whole plane of  innocents into the rockies. Then we have the spectacle of Tom Cruise doing  a Peter Parker up the side of a sheer rock wall, so far so good. But then  things go a bit awry from then on. <br />I'm a big fan of John Woo, there are  few directors around who can direct action scenes with such visual flair  and inventiveness. Check out any number of scenes from 'Hard Boiled' or  'The Killer' and you'll have your eyeballs treated to scenes edited and  shot to perfection. With MI2 though the stunts seem to be just rehashed  partly from the original. For example the first film had Ethan Hunt  dangling from a cable in a CIA computer vault, this one has him diving from  a helicopter into  a vent. Bigger, as they say, isn't always better.    Other things that annoy are a lack of explanation about why Sean Ambrose  has gone totally loony. I mean, are IMF in the habit of hiring fruitcases  to be their agents or what!  Again, there's no indication of his  motivations or Hunt's and Ambroses previous relationship. I'm not saying  that there should be a huge chunk of the film set aside for explanations as  it's an action film first and foremost and not an episode of sunset beach.  A perfect thing to do would be do what Goldeneye did and have the two  agents on a mission together and have something tragic happen, at least we  could have been draw into the story a tad more.<br />Other characters in the  film seem to be totally sidelined, Thandie Newton's character happily hops  into bed with Ethan Hunt and is magically transformed into a 'Hunt Girl'.  Her task later in the film is to look willowy and defenceless until the  hero saves her from the deadly virus (yawn). Anthony Hopkins is criminally  underused, he's marginalised to a cameo role to add some form of gravitas  to the whole proceeding. Ving Rhames reprises his role of Luther Stickel,  the computer hacker, but again he seems to disappear into the background  with nothing more than a perfunctory back-up role.<br />Dougray Scott has a  rent-a-villain look about him, he sneers, he bullies and yes he kills  innocent people before breakfast. What made a nice change this time around  was that he wasn't a British bad guy (big sigh of relief), yes he's..wait  for it..Scottish! Remember Hollywood, the UK is full of loons (we're not  happy about losing the empire you see) Personally I'm waiting for is a  Welsh bad guy, that would be worth a fiver in anyone's currency.<br />What  really wound me up though was what made the series and in part the first MI  film cool, was the element of teamwork. It wasn't about just one person  doing the work, it was the IMF team battling the enemy. Not so here, Tom  does all the kicking ass (in slowmotion...woohoo) All I have for this are  two words...James Bond. I caught myself thinking anytime soon he's going to  say 'The name is Hunt..Ethan Hunt' , he did come close though on one  occasion. Added to all this there really are some howlers of plot devices.  Examples include, applying a face mask of an enemy henchman in a couple of  minutes, motorbikes that miraculously change tread without stopping and  best of all, flame retardent pidgeons (you'll know the scene). <br />Adding  all these points together I really felt let down by the whole MI2  experience. The film does have some excellent stuff in it and John Woo does  pull off some magic here and there but sadly he's having what appears to be  another bad Hollywood experience. The same thing happened with him on  Broken Arrow and Hard Target and it looks like much of the same here. I was  hoping that the DVD might contain an alternate cut of the film, but alas  there is no mention. In all honesty I'd recommend saving your money and  watching x-men instead, much better in every department really. <br />To sum  up, Yes, the original is better and another thing..Tom..get you hair cut  mate.

B00HDMMISA|4|Big Little Lies is an enlightening, realistically and beautifully written novel with enough humor to soften the bleak truth of three women hiding big little lies.  If people knew the truth, their lives would change, and they are reticent for change.  What would become of them if people really knew?  This is a nonstop, entertaining read which stirs the reader to face his/her own hidden &#34;lies.&#34;
B004X4R49Y|5|We saw this in the theater when it came out and ordered it online for our library.<br />It was as good or better since we were able to watch t our leisure in our home on our schedule.<br />An interesting and informative look at the lives of the royal family in that era.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for your library!

078322737X|5|My husband loved it!
0937381888|4|This is my go-to book for home brewing.  However, the pictures and some of the content needs to be updated as the pictures are pretty old looking and the overall feel of the book just feels dated.  An updated edition would make this book 5 stars all the way.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Needs more app support, and it wouldn't let my laptop connect to its wireless network for setup, other than that works great.
B007VUA7VO|5|It lets me now how much battery i have without having to click on top right and going to more options. My kindle is laggy so it helps alot
B00004RFDW|5|the film was well done and the actors competent,  It outlined a very important time in U.S. history.  The first time that a major cigarette company had to pay or injury to a smoker.  And the torment that a whistleblower and his family suffered via the cigarette company.  The problems that the company was willing to cause 60 minute new and the news stations cbs and nbc.

B00BP4Z8XY|5|Kids loved it.
B00I80LS2I|5|Jane Austen is always worth a re-read. Even better to study and discuss. That is why I like the website 'Republic of Pemberly'. All of us Austen hardcore meet there.
1849163863|3|The above reviewer has described the premise of this book very well, so I won't repeat that and will concentrate on my opinion of it.  The good bits first.  The Black House is a highly atmospheric book, painting a detailed and fascinating picture of the life and traditions of an insular island people.  The murder mystery moves along at a good pace, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader intrigued.  I didn't mind the switches in time, finding that they added to the suspense as well as building up a more intricate picture of the characters lives.    What really spoiled this book for me was the climax.  Far from finding it unexpected and dramatic as the above reviewer did, I found it a major letdown.  (*POSSIBLE SPOILER*).  I won't give away any details of the plot, but will say that the resolution was based around a case of repressed memory, a significant one spanning several years.  Now I'm sure this kind of thing may happen, but not nearly so often as it's portrayed in fiction, and to me it always seems something of a cheat.  My immediate reaction was \\"Oh not this again\\", followed by \\"how likely is that - NOT\\".  After this the rest of the book felt flat to me and I rushed to the end as quickly as possible.    Another thing that made me roll my eyes was the stereotyped portrayal of the animal rights activist - skinny, pale, ineffectual, effeminate and too stupid to realise his hypocrisy in eating fish but not meat.  Please.  Whatever May's views on hunting, setting up it's opponents as straw men does nothing to enhance his credibility.   To me The Black House was worth a read for the journey rather than the destination.
B000SEIK2S|4|I loved the characters and the original premise of the old becoming young again, I've never read anything like it. Did not see a lot of the plot twists coming, which is what I read for.
B0013TXA5Y|4|The book was good.  I will probably continue to read this series.
B004LQGXPA|5|Amazing
B00QW8TYWO|5|I like crossroad.
B0015OKWL2|4|Turk and Rooster have been partners in the NYPD for 30 years. They could retire, but they are investigating the murder of a notorious pimp that they have been chasing for years. They are trying to resolve a mystery that was thought to have been solved a long time ago. The twist at the end will really get you going.<br /><br />This movie is pretty good. I'm not normally a fan of Deniro or Pacino, but this movie delivers. It's got action, mystery, suspense, and drama. The story is engrossing, and the acting is good as well. The premise behind this movie is awesome, and timeless. Is it okay to kill the bad guys, and is it a crime deserving of punishment? Taking the law into one's own hands is against the law, but should it be? If you are interested in those questions, then definitely watch this movie. If you're not, watch it anyway. It's very entertaining.
B0051UP5NQ|4|I like it for use in spread sheets for my Excel spread sheets.  It would be a little easier to use with a small demo preceding at the beginning of the programs.  It is easy to work with. Perhaps a troubleshooting section could be incorporated.
1935597760|5|I enjoyed this book tremendously; it was touching, funny, tragic, and yet with the ending, it had such a satisfying conclusion.  I cried through the last couple of chapters.  Recommend highly.  It's a gem!
B00FAPF5U0|4|I can't load the dreamworld onto my kindle...any suggestions..  also how do you conquer level 70?  It's been a month at least and I can't get any further

0062209493|4|This brought back memories of Vietnam, not knowing who the true enemy was and that their value of life in sôme countries is not the same as the United States. Chris was very honest about life in the military and should help families understand the stress and help them to deal with different situations when returning home.

B00HDMMISA|3|Well written, feminist themes, hard to read but in a good way. This is my first time reading this author and I found the story to be really enthralling, I couldn't put the book down.
B00003W8NM|5|This movie is much more than you might expect. Darkly hilarious, it mercilessly takes swings at our materialism and artificial way of life in this post-feminist society. I almost hate to say it, but it is even more funny and relevant with the current threat of terrorism. Gives moviegoers a much needed shot of reality in a surrealistic way.
B002N5N4M6|4|I am very happy with this dvd I want to get all the other season's to add to my collection of movies would recommend to others
6305047677|4|The three Chaplin comedies collected together for the \\"Best of Chaplin, Volume 3\\" consist of a pair of two-reel comedies that he did during his happy days at Mutual, and what is usually considered to be the first appearance by the beloved character of the Tramp in the third comedy the comedian made for Keystone:<br /><br />\\"The Adventurer\\" (Released October 22, 1917), is the last of the films Chaplin did for Mutual.  Charlie plays a convict who escapes after a lengthy chase scene and end up rescuing not only the lovely Edna Purviance, but also her mother and obnoxious fianc&eacute;. Hailed as a hero, everyone thinks Charlie is a wealthy yachtsman and he gets invited to a dinner party at the Judge's mansion.  There, of course, it is just a question of time before his true identity is revealed and things get out of hand.<br /><br />\\"The Cure\\" (Released April 16, 1917) has Chaplin as a wealthy inebriate who is trying to dry out at a sanitarium where once again the lovely Edna catches his eye. If you have ever seen a clip from this one it is probably Chaplin's comic use of the revolving door and the poor guy with the gouty foot. The big joke in this one is that the supply of booze Charlie has brought in a trunk to survive the experience of sobering up ends up being dumped into the mineral spring, which makes for a lot of happy people in the end of this one.<br /><br />3. \\"Mabel's Strange Predicament\\" (Released February 9, 1914) bring Chaplin and Mable Normand together for the first time. They would make nine one-reelers together, including the ambitious six-reeler \\"Tillie's Punctured Romance,\\" and most of them, like this one, were more Mable Normand comedies than Charlie Chaplin comedies.  Chaplin plays a drunken masher for the first time on screen, who tries to get acquainted with the elegantly dressed Mabel, who has to deal with her husband (Chester Conklin), another admirer (Harry McCoy), and his jealous wife (Alice Davenport). The interesting thing here is how Chaplin, the relative novice, steals the movie from the star, Norman, although she really has nothing special to do in this one so it was not a fair fight.<br /><br />None of these three comedies are a true Chaplin classic, although the first appearance of the Tramp (according to most critics; Chaplin had a slightly different view), has some historic importance.  At the very least viewers can have an appreciation for how much Chaplin had grown as a film comedian in a couple of years by comparing his early work at Keystone with the more polished Mutual productions.in, the relative novice, steals the movie from the star, Norman, although she really has nothing special to do in this one so it was not a fair fight.  <br /> <br />None of these three comedies are a true Chaplin classic, although the first appearance of the Tramp (according to most critics; Chaplin had a slightly different view), has some historic importance.

B006MW3UZW|5|Great master piece
B001NLL8LA|5|I will be so sad when Jack Teacher runs its course. I like the idea of his character going against the grain if it's the right thing to do regardless. Recommend to anyone who loves a good action packed drama.
B005DNPKSQ|5|A classic , one of Jim Carrey's best
B00IMYZOBQ|4|Wow - what a scary movie. Sandra Bullock was GREAT. I understand why she was nominated for an Oscar.  Really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great special effects.
B0012GTZC0|5|WWII spy thriller that even though we well know the outcome, keeps the reader on the edge of the seat.  Un-put-downable.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|I love Angelina and believe she has matured into an amazing actress --plus, she's grown into her gorgeous face!  Although I've heard from others that they disapprove of this revisionist story of the classic &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; fairy tale, I found Maleficent to be a story of love, redemption and--above all--the strength and power of women.<br />The cinematography is beautiful; the acting (especially Angelina's) is powerful yet subtle.  There are lovely bits of humor strewn throughout the film and imaginative creatures to delight the child in all of us.  Although this film might not be especially memorable for very young children, its message of self-confidence and freedom would have a marvelous effect on girls 10 and older who are searching for a strong female identity.<br />Unlike the Sleeping Beauty who passively waits for some prince to rescue her, this Maleficent takes her life into her own strong hands, and soars.  See it for the acting, see it for the beautiful, imaginative universe it creates, see it for the message of redemptive love, but see it!
B000OXHRRC|5|What a Great, feel-good story. Made me want to move to southern France...<br />A realistic, fun, modern-day love story.<br />- I recommend to all...
1843794411|5|Another amazing narration by Richard Armitage, excellent story!
B00CZ1TMUQ|5|Great music and great singing.  These two make an excellent singing duo.  We bought both of their recordings.  Buy it.

B00GP1ANXC|5|It rocks people I DO NOT trust the people who hate this app. Don't trust the people who hate is app, but it does take u to youtube. I can finally watch the people I like on minecraft. I rated it a five star because you can watch people build on minecraft like giant cruise ship or watch people go and try to make it through a tough maze.
B00IG2DOKM|5|Just started it and It is super fun.
B00340ESIS|5|If you are writing a screenplay, this is a must read
B0076UXKDG|3|I like the way it works but given the additional benefits it is very expensive<br />It works well but again think twice before spending this kind of money. There are more useful accessories that you can buy instead of this.
B00006LFGD|3|The good thing is that the lyrics are printed beside the songs.  Too many of them try to be too complex and are hard to understand and follow.  Especially liked the one Barbra did with herself, and the one with Neil Diamond &#34;You Don't Bring Me Flowers&#34;.  Okay if you have nothing to do but listen, but not what I would choose as music to multi-task with.
B00A2AHU2E|3|It was ok.  Natalie Portman was as good at an early age as she was in the star wars movies.  Surprisingly no awards for any of them.
B007IXWKUK|5|I am completely obsessed with this trilogy! E L James you are amazing, and I cannot wait to read  Christian's point of view!!!!
B004ZQRJFO|4|This is a great album by Royce Da 5'9 and Eminem. I bought the 9 tracks cd. The last two tracks were leaked.<br />From the intro to the last track on the album is very good. Each track tells a different story.

0439023491|5|I think I liked Suzanne Collins' \\"Catching Fire\\" even more than the first book in the series.  The people are ready to rebel, as they've seen more than enough death and suffering caused by the 'government'.  When President Snow decides to punish the citizens by forcing most surviving Games winners to once again enter the arena for the Quarter Quell, he takes things too far, presses too hard on the downtrodden.<br /><br />Peeta and Katniss will go to any lengths necessary to save one another, if it's in their power.  Plus, Haymitch wants them to make allies of some of his old buddies, which does not exactly thrill Katniss.  Why start a friendship with people she may probably be forced to kill?  Nothing prepares them for what they will face this time.<br /><br />The ending of this book was so much better than where the first one left off.  \\"Catching Fire\\" stops at a point where I'm itching for more, want to see what happens so bad I'll probably start reading the \\"Mockingjay\\" tomorrow.
B003O3E4L6|4|Thought provoking, disturbing.  Think I should, but think I can't, read it a second time.  The determination of the mother to understand keeps you in the read.
B00RNRD8RA|4|I've seen movies that should have created a bigger up roar. Was good adult movie. Not appropriate for younger kids.
1405267674|5|My son is a huge Minecraft fan and he has a set of four books and said he needed this one to complete it. I'm not exactly sure why it's more expensive than the rest but then when I got it I saw it is a much larger book, almost like a yearbook.<br /><br />I don't know a whole lot about Minecraft but I do know a lot about my seven year old. He doesn't love to read and usually does it only when forced. He sat down and read this book cover to cover. That pretty much tells me all I need to know.
B009YP9L7U|5|Good read.<br />Plot keeps your attention.<br />Female character is strong with her own career path, which is admired by the man.<br />Both characters have flaws that appear real rather than fictional.
0007466064|4|this item arrived on time in great packaging. cant wait to finish readint it so i can move on to the next one in the series.
0790701251|5|I rated this movie a classic the first time I saw it. While many would disagree with me, I believe it is the first part of the movie that makes it a classic.<br />The depiction of life in a military boot camp, with all the  indoctrination, dehumanizing and debasement that goes on makes you shake  your head when we pause and realize that these are, in many cases, only 18  and 19-year-old boys that we train to be killers without remorse.<br />The  battle scenes were okay, but overall, I thought it was how they showed  regular, All-American kids and turned them into ravenous beasts that really  made the movie.
B000002AGN|5|If my desert island cds were just instrumental jazz, this and Stan Getz' Focus would top the list. Even if Take Five was the only cut on the record.

B000002KMY|3|Despite Sign of the Southern Cross is ones of Sabbath's best the album as a whole is not one of my favorites, it lacks the edge of previous liricks.
B002361MLA|5|This short book explains, and clarify all my past questions.And I am going to reread it until I get it right.
B0000A02TZ|5|Have worn out the DVD we watch it so much.  Too many hilarious lines to qoute.  Highly recommend this DVD.
B008IBPMZG|5|Great series, I love the characters and the storylines.  The interaction between Upstairs and Downstairs is very interesting.  There's always something going on, things that make you laugh and cry.
B0095P31L6|2|I never got to the end of the movie. It just was not very interesting. I may try to finish it one of these days.
B00IK1NTCW|5|Great interface for fun sketches, love that you can control the thickness using pressure.
B008RA3X5E|5|This app is very good for my purpose.  It is very functional and practical.  Numbers are large and very visible.  I can set several alarms in the same set up screen.  I can also choose the type of alarm or music to  wake up to and a snooze option with adjustable duration..  It also gives you a summay of the weather at your locaiton if you have an wifi connection available.  I recommend this app.
B003UBTX7C|4|Another example of the writing success of David Baldacci.  I enjoy his style, characters, and plot twists.  This book met all my criteria for a very good, perhaps not great, reading experience.  In fact, the entire Camel Club series has been a great reading experience.<br /><br />This time Oliver Stone has teamed up with a British detective.  It brings a different dynamic to the book.  A nice touch to this book.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Jump in and enjoy the ride, you won't be disappointed. Very exciting and would recommend to anyone, even if you don't typically go for science fiction. Love this book!
B00IRKXV3S|5|We all love the Gruffalo and the Gruffalo's son as well.
B0000931QR|5|I got this CD while I was in Monterrey, MX on vacation. I was so lucky to get this fresh CD on the release day. This album is soo good, it's excellent, that I keep listening to it over and over. If you don't have the other albums, you should get them too, they're awesome. So definitely I give 5 stars to this album.
B00BFUUMO8|4|difficult obtaining dollars for purchase.<br />Challenge was moving around the secure fences<br />Once my son figured out challenge faustration diminished
B006LSZECO|3|It was interesting, Kept you guessing.
B00HZ3C4N6|2|It's alright  I like other movies way better

B00FAPF5U0|5|Although I am not one of the video game generation, I really had fun learning how to play candy crush.  It reminds me of slot play and its easy to spend hours playing.
B0054JZC6E|5|this app is so fun and easy . I like how we have to earn points to unlock other games 1-100 I give it a 100
B0052VUNHC|5|I devoured this book. I was out for an afternoon with my family when I bought it for my kindle app on my phone which was a mistake because I kept wanting to hide away and keep reading! Especially the first half of this book I thought was just fantastic. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Great waste of time.
B00KY7PEAA|5|I think it is a great game to build.
B00005B4GU|5|I am a pretty good fan of Radiohead.As soon as I heard Creep I knew they were good.Pablo Honey,The Bends,and OK Computer were all great,but then came Kid A and now Amesiac.Kid A was better than the three before,but Amesiac blows them all away.Its like all four albums blended together.It has more of a Kid A sound to it.I like there new stuff more then there old.As soon as you put it in the cd player you are hooked.Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box is amasing.Then into the piano driven Pryamid Song.After that comes Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors which it the best song on the cd.Tom's voice is a electronic voice with very little lyrics.It has the best beat I ever heard before in my life.It is a brilliant song.I think they were tried of hearing about OK Computer so they went in a new direction.It was a good choice.There new sound is like no one elses and it is awesome.Thank you Radiohead for giving us another BRILLIANT record.
B009HUB40Y|2|Time is too short, you can't get into it properly. It is a great game but the timing sucks!
B00FAPF5U0|5|makes no sense.  wants u to buy in order to move on.
B009IEXKXI|5|I loved the story. Gripping me from the very first page.  In no time at all I was unable to put it down!  Thanks for a great read!
B00003CX8Y|5|I have rewound the VCR tape so often, I lost count.  Beauty and the Beast is a movie that you will get lost in an forget what's going on around you.  It reassures you that their is always hope and love always prevails! I'm excited that they are now putting it on DVD! It took long enough!!!!
B00DKY4NBA|5|It's a fantastic album, of course, but they've done an excellent job with the vinyl. Great sound, great balance, great depth. Very pleased with purchase.
630349255X|4|I worry sometimes about films like this . . . it seems to just fuel the fire of those that would like nothing better than to return to the primitive times and live in a jungle. Then they complain about the lousy  DVD transfer! :)<br />Hrrm. This film has many beautiful and startling images,  and the soundtrack is superior to any of the others in the genre. There is  even order and serenity in the seemingly chaotic urban centers. It's a very  settling film -- not really lulling anyone into complacency, just  acceptance of the complexity of our world.<br />I can't give it five stars  because video, no matter how expertly transferred, can not do it justice.  And for the fact that it couldn't keep me from falling asleep (it may have  been doomed there, I was exhausted; it did do better than Microcosmos,  though).
B00GCE3TCE|5|The book grabbed me and held me tight right until the last breathtaking, beautiful word!  Ah, beautiful words...how I love them...
B00A8ECU24|1|This game will not let you fully exit out of the game so therefor do not download this game.It will take you through the steps to the game witch is helpful to us.
1885167776|5|This book has literally changed my entire way of thinking!! It's amazing how just going one or two steps deeper into what you think might be your ONE thing will actually make the true ONE thing become so clear!<br /><br />It's almost too simple to be this life changing but it's pretty darn amazing!<br /><br />Love it!!! Easy Read!!!
0307010856|5|Cute and funny.
B007FEFLTO|5|Awesome, I really enjoy his books. It is like a history lesson .
1451636016|5|His latest book continues to push the envelope and challenge socially constructed realties in ways that many of Harris' secular counterparts are either too afraid, or too narrow minded to do.<br /><br />I've read every book Harris has published.  The first three, while they greatly confirmed many beliefs and opinions that I already had and articulated them in ways I was unable to do, did not improve my life in any significant way.  His book on lying forced me to tear down the webs of justification I had constructed around the &#34;white lie,&#34; and as a result, gave me a newfound appreciation for honesty in all situations.  His book about free will, without a doubt, has had the biggest moral influence on my life--more than any other piece of literature.  It completely destroys any notions about the legitimacy of punishment, hatred, or retribution.<br /><br />However, &#34;Waking Up,&#34; is perhaps his biggest intellectual risk yet, in terms of potentially alienating many of his secular readers--the crowd where I originally discovered his work from.  Being someone who has absolutely zero legitimate meditation experience, after reading this book, I feel as though most of the efficacies contained within it must be confirmed by subjective experience.  All the same, I was unable to find a single disagreement I had with his arguments in this book.<br /><br />I have also, since finishing it, been inspired to enroll in a 10-day intro to Vipassana course in northern Massachusetts.  I believe there is something significant to be experienced through training one's consciousness, and I feel like I've been missing out.<br /><br />If you're a militant atheist like myself, this book will force you to no longer view &#34;spirituality&#34; and contemplative traditions with such skepticism.  If you're deeply religious, this book will force you to realize that the transformative epiphanies you've experienced within your religion may have more to do with your subjective conscious experience, and less to do with the validity of your scriptures.  Either way, there is something for everyone to gain from reading &#34;Waking Up.&#34;
B00F8H0LM2|5|This is an awesome sequel to the first Angry Birds Star Wars. More levels, more characters, and the Pork Side!!!  The only thing Rovio needs now is an Angry Birds Lord of the Rings, or Hobbit...
B003F3NDOE|5|Great series, and the dvd's arrived in great shape, no problems viewing any of the discs, so I'm happy with the purchase.
0345529057|5|I do not usually read fantasy books. My shelves are filled with non-fiction, mostly on military topics. But when a friend lent me the first book of this series (A Game of Thrones), I fell in love with it. Eager to read more of the fantasy genre, I read other series, but none could compare to A Game of Thrones, so I went back to the series I loved most. Because I didnt own any of the books, I picked up this bundle, which I might say is an amazing deal!   I dont think I need to go into detail on why I love this series, as it has been said so many times already.  My only negative comment would be that the print smudges a little bit. Not serious, but it can be annoying.    So, put down Harry Potter and pick up A Song of Ice and Fire!
B003H9MSPG|3|Kids love this gun and that is probably what matters most but this thing is huge and I think just too big.  Perhaps in the summer it'll be more manageable outdoors but the smaller guns are more popular and easier to use.  All the kids have complained that the shoulder stock doesn't come off as it does with some of the other nerd guns. I think their attempt to make it smaller was thwarted and disappointing.<br /><br />I'd pass on this and get something different if I had to do it again.
B00MUCX6AW|5|Very interesting movie with a unique  concept.  I enjoyed the action and imagination. It is like it's titled: Live. Die. Repeat.
B005Q1W10A|4|Although I have not had a chance to see this, I know that it will be very enjoyable.  I saw a few of the episodes on television.
B009KS4XRO|5|This game is so much fun. I'm addicted. The only down side is that the game cut out on me a few times and took my credits.
B001NVIZ3E|5|Very upbeat, fun and colorful!
B00687Q0VC|5|This is one of HBO's best series...
B00AEJM6H2|5|Recommended. You have enough time to enjoy the game even with limited recognition capability.a no stress game for beginners.<br />Www
B003O86FMW|5|I loved the first book i loved this book and i bet i am gonna love the next book also
B00DR0PDNE|1|Worthless item does not connect to my TV correctly.  Almost no product info included.  Does not work on my wifi
B00AA2W4L6|5|Love IRON MAN, got this for my grandson .  it is a classic
B007SSEBCU|4|I learned much about her and admire her more for her contributions. However, I do not share her political views and opinions.
B0096MM9GG|5|Muy bueno
B0054JZC6E|4|awesome game. so much fun. entertains me for hours. great game for in the car or at the airport. I cant wait until I unlock more games.
B000268QB2|5|This CD is totally amazing. This guys falsetto voice is incredible and the songs are addicting. My favorite one is She Has No Time. If you like Coldplay, I think you'll love this!
B00DR0PDNE|4|Quick, easy set-up. Streaming from You Tube within 10-mins, however disappointed to find we will not be able to use this to watch Game of Thrones on Sunday. The new HBO Now app does not recognize the Chromecast. Guess I will be going back to my cable company 😔
B005LAJ22Q|5|I LOVED IT - AFTER SEASON 1 WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT - DID NOT WANT IT TO END!
B00DPM7TIG|5|I absolutely love this book!  So beautifully written.  I had never heard of it nor the author,but when I read the first page of the sample on my Kindle, that's all I needed.  I bought it immediately!
B00CL68NOG|4|Thought it would be funnier, but it was heartwarming and fun. Made me miss the days my son and I spent following the jetski circuit hauling around his machines.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Very engaging book. Quick read, nice message, not preachy. The use of different viewpoints made it readable and believable. Well worth reading.
B00HY7VU60|4|really great series, too bad it is only one season but I would still recommend it
B004J4WKTW|2|A lot of my favorite book people recommended this to me, but it was one of those books where I never felt entirely invested in any of the characters or the plot.  I kept trying and slowly read the whole book, but just never got caught up the magic that I think many others did.
B00B7Y0206|4|Still playing around with it, figuring everything out.  Not nearly as many videos as YouTube, it gets to the bottom of the page and just keeps saying loading and never loads more videos.  However I still enjoy it on my kindle hd since now you need Adobe to watch most YouTube videos
B00DVKOYBM|3|Great game simple set up, my only gripe is that slop shots count I can't say how many times I have been screwed over because people make slop it is not only till bigger stakes games that you need to call ball and pocket. as a pool player I use BCA rules and I find this annoying as all get out
B007F5SG22|5|Are you interested in knowing what it is like growing up in a tribal society? The first half of this brilliant autobiography describes in the author's personal experiences growing up in Somalia, bound by tribal ties. She also describes her personal engagement with Islam.<br /><br />Are you interesting in knowing about the experience of radical displacement felt in running away from home and going to a totally foreign place? The second half of the book reports the author's experience as a refugee in Holland, and her growing concern with the human rights of Muslim women.<br /><br />To my mind, this is one of the most informative and honest accounts of both tribal society and the refugee experience. I have assigned it to my anthropology students, and recommend it to all.
B001KDQ4KQ|5|A strong, well written story. You will think about the characters and their lives long after you put the book down.
B00003JRCQ|5|This film is in every respect superior to the BBC drama from 2007. Actors, settings, but above all the narration and dramatic interpretation of Austen's masterpiece. A must-see!
0307454541|5|I thoroughly enjoyed The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  This is the first in a trilogy involving genius computer-hacker and outcast, Lisbeth Salander and journalist-publisher, Mikael Blomkvist.  It's an unusual, but very well-written, crime mystery.  Except for an occasional break, I read the book cover to cover in one sitting, because I could not put it down.  Lisbeth was quirky but I loved her and Mikael and the interaction between them.
B0055SWM08|4|I highly recommend this game for all users. the ambient music is relaxing to the ear, while the puzzles are challenging and fun. it includes a high volume of puzzles for hours of time killing.
B003QO8TDC|4|got this one for the great dance scenes and soundtrack of old 80's-90's favorites. Perhaps not the bestmade film ever, but the soundtrack is phenomenal.
B007SYWFRM|5|its great game great to make different families and take care of them and play games. collect money and feed families. and visit friends
B004J4WKTW|5|What a beautiful, beautiful book. It's tremendously complex and simple, and lovely and practical.<br /><br />Characterizing it is difficult. It has an excellent structure; I don't want to discuss the structure here, as it would be spoilers, but it was very poetical. The characters were well-drawn and complex. The imagery of the circus almost overwhelms the story sometimes, like a tremendously ornate framework for a painting that in the end is an artwork in itself.<br /><br />I liked it very much.
B00GH4R95C|5|Awesome a must see.
B004JZBGWI|5|I have this on my Droid X2 and kindel fire.... syncs with Google. The author of this app. does great work.
B00FXEL00W|4|I read this when it was recommended for the AfterEllen.com Book of the month--and quite enjoyed it.  It was a quick and pleasant read.  The author does a great job creating the chemistry between the main characters, partly by creating a fantastic internal dialogue. I found myself eager to find out how the story was going to pan out.  Kudos on a great first book.
B000R7GKQE|5|I can watch it when I want to....
B00FAX6XQC|5|One of the best games I have ever play still have not beat it but I think it good so far
B0089LOG02|4|One orphan's story was far more interesting than the other's. The end of this book felt rushed. But I enjoyed it enough.
1451624468|5|If you are a Lawrence Krauss fan you will like it. You have to have a little knowledge of physics though to be able to digest it.
B00FN5Z8UY|5|always good
B009GEEMLY|5|Action Packed !!!!! Good to see the &#34;Good Old Boys&#34; back in action again.....A Must See
B00123KDMO|5|This was the last good thing to come from Van Halen. The songs were a continuation of what fans would have expected, but not stale and used. This was  truly good rock and roll. If you want to add a Van Halen album, it should be this one.
B00000255F|5|It's hard for an album to live up to expectations, especially 20-some years after release.  Rock music tends to date itself, to become nostalgic and lose its vibrancy. But 'Born To Run' didn't follow any trends then and it still doesn't today.<br />The perfect rock record. The hits are classic rock staples and the lost songs are better than the hits. This album is magic. It can't be defined, predicted or stopped. These songs sound so fresh today they must have been downright alien at the time of their release. Springsteen and producer Phil Spector create their 'wall of sound' that amplifies that flawless layering of The E Street Band and brings forth the messages of love and magic in these songs.<br />The songs go without saying: 'Thunder Road,' 'Born To Run,' 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.' A song like 'Night' is overlooked only because everything else was so noticed there simply wasn't time to point it out. In 'Jungleland' Springsteen created rock's one song opus, as fine a popular musical composition as there's ever been. For ten exhausted minutes Bruce takes us up highs and lows in a town most of us have never visited but we can see ourselves walking down those streets with him. It's indescribable, exhausting, too loud and too long but once its over you have to start it over, at least to hear 'Thunder Road' again, then 'Tenth Avenue.'<br />'Born To Run' is the ultimate teenage rock and roll album. Later teen angst'ers don't get it. It's not about anger, it's not about desperation. It's about dreams and spirits and kisses on summer afternoons.<br />It's about Bruce Springsteen. And this is the album that proved that. It still does today. An album like this hadn't come before and won't come again. It transcends itself, its era and its performers.
B004LROUNG|4|A fun & easy read; cute story with a cute ending. Worth reading. Pick it up. Just wish the trial ended differently
B007KQ6XYY|5|Good
B003F3NEBG|5|This was a fantastic telling of this most excellent story. The BBC team surely out did themselves. This is some of the finest acting I have ever seen. I highly recommend this whether you are a fan of Pride and Prejudice or not! I have a feeling after seeing this you will be!
B00GLRLZ0K|5|This game is true genius... no malware, viruses, or anything rash... just an amazing game with great visuals and great sound! I think the Amazon Appstore is on a roll this past week with extraordinary titles that have been FAOTD's... including this one! (Other great titles that were FAOTD recently include Garfield's Escape, Toca Lab, Bardbarian: Golden Lute Edition, Regular Show: Ghost Toasters, Riptide GP2, OfficeSuite Pro, and the list goes on.)<br /><br />In this sequel to the original Naught, you control the titular character, a cat-like creature, through gravity-defying levels while collecting seeds and diamonds. There are three diamonds in each level, and you can go back to a level if you haven't collected all of the diamonds there. Once you collect a diamond, you can't go back to collect it again, but you can collect diamonds you haven't collected in previous levels. In addition, you set can set checkpoints just in case you die. Even the slightest touch of a bramble, or a large spiked vine, can kill you. You can also collect seeds to complete levels and activate hidden dark areas which can contain diamonds. Additionally, there is also an eye on the screen that points to the exit of each level and you can touch it to activate the game's pause menu. There are also two different control options, accelerometer and non-accelerometer. The accelerometer control method allows you to tilt the screen to make Naught move and touch it to make him jump. The non-accelerometer controls have virtual buttons that make Naught move: two buttons on the left that make him move left or right and one on the right to make him jump. The game itself, with all these features mentioned in this paragraph, makes it fun with a bit of a challenge.<br /><br />In the words of the Wallflowers (since I have their song \\"The Difference\\" playing over and over again in the background as I'm writing this review, and the header is a reference to the song): - \\"The only difference... that I see... is that you are exactly the same... as you used to be...\\" (This lyric that comprises the song's chorus slightly mentions the difference - no pun intended - between the game itself and the original Naught, which was an FAOTD back in December.)<br /><br />Overall, this game deserves five stars for fun, challenge, intuitive gameplay, awesome music, loads of niche appeal, and the fact that the app itself is perfectly polished. And if Jakob Dylan (The Wallflowers' frontman, and yes, he is Bob Dylan's son) was playing this game, he might be referencing \\"The Difference\\" as how much he loves it.
B002RVCD6O|5|I loved reading all of the seven books in the series and think they did an awesome job of reproducing them in the movies. All of them are outstanding!
B00E8KLWB4|4|I can not wait to play this game every day. It is challenging, but I can still be successful. There is variety in the different puzzles. Some puzzles are much more difficult than others. I also like that I can use helps. I wish I could find more games like this.
B00JNQKR46|5|Ian MacEwan wrote another masterpiece. An excellent story that holds the reader's interest from start to finish. I highly recommend it for a weekend read
B00F8F3J2S|5|You name it this book has pathos and  ethos and much more.  There are passages that are moving due to the humanity Gates brings to government.  This book is not ego driven like so many first hand accounts.  The behind the scenes information helps us to understand the complex decision making process for war and peace.  I have asked retired military friends that were career officers about Gates statements about the bureaucracy in the military and at the Pentagon.  They have confirmed many of Gates' observations that Gates makes in his book.  Most Americans already have a perception about what a screwed up bunch we have as our representatives in congress and Gates confirms our view..  Well written and not tedious to read..
B008IJT0CE|5|This app works like a charm.  I use it every night.  There are so many options to choose from and to make you own combinations.  It even helps soothe my dog, who is no longer barking at every little bump in the night.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BVYNM4K|5|Top notch production all around. There aren't many productions as good as this one, so I'm left in amazement that Showtime dropped this for a fourth season and replaced it with a show that never aired.<br /><br />If there is any way to have this same cast, writer(s) and director come back for either the final season or some offshoot series, I think it would be very popular.
B0002EXH40|5|What a great album! Definitely worth the price
B007EC27QM|5|It can add 2+2 more than our Congress can.
B000XUBFE2|4|I really enjoyed this book. The topic isn't new, but the fact that it is about a non-Jewish girl's experience in Nazi Germany and that it is narrated by Death makes it interesting.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Awesome game love it so fun!! Nice job  Hipster Whale!
B00D6B4PUG|5|Works Good!!
B0047AJ046|5|Bought for my 10 year old who loves Justin Bieber. She She would rate any of his CDs a 5/5.
B008UCJ7KO|2|Not much story, too graphic and too long scenes, a tv series type ending, a disappointment after the first 2 books that I enjoyed reading
B000SNUMC0|5|wow... I never heard of this band before.  I am a Queensryche and Savatage fan and got this recommended to me by amazon and noticed that tim ripper owens was on it so I decided to check it out and boy was I surprised.  with apologies to Tool / A Perfect Circle / Sevendust this album is in my opinion is THE BEST hard rock /  metal album I've heard since I can't even remember... maybe as far back as Metallica's black album.  I'm so excited because I had pretty much resigned myself to listening to Wolfmother if I wanted to hear something new and hard and good again.  This band kicks buttocks so hard that it leaves a footprint and I can almost taste it's bootlaces in the back of my throat.  I went out and bought the greatest hits album and alive in athens and the glorious burden and can't wait to give those a try as soon as I listen to this album again!!!  If you're a fan of Savatage, Metallica, Queensryche, Dio, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King Diamond, etc. and feel like somethinig is missing in your life because you haven't heard any new music this century that speaks to you, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS.
B00GUXI184|1|when plugged in iphone give a message this is not compatible. don't buy this at least for the 5S, not compatible.
B00127RAJY|5|When I looked at reviews before doing this dvd and during, what really interested me was the results people have seen. With that in mind, I will tell you what I have seen:    I started out at 5'9\\" and 156 lbs, a size 8. The first month I did this dvd 3-4 times a week and I tried to watch what I ate, but in all honesty I cheated on my diet a bit too much, so I didn't see much for results. I did notice an improvement in my strength and conditioning though. I think I did levels 1 and 2 around 15 times each before moving on to level 3.    Then in February, I really started watching my diet a lot more (I aim for 1400-1600 cals a day, my BMR is 1530) and also having days where I do two of the workouts or incorporate some cardio in as well. Last time I weighed myself, I was down to 151 and my clothes are fitting really well again.    I think part of the reason I wasn't seeing results is that I don't have a big amount to lose as I am at a \\"normal\\" BMI. But I really want to gain muscle definition and hopefully at the end of this journey I will be in the mid 130's. I hope this helps someone that is in the same boat that I am!
B000NVIXDW|5|I think this is a fabulous CD....I love the \\"rat pack\\" feel of it and Michael's tone.  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME
B008ALA6DW|5|I don't often have to use a wired connection, but this works great when I need one for my 2014 MBpro. The only surprising thing to me is how warm it gets.
B0042FZOFU|1|Two out of three of my dvds have issues. One skips completely over a section of the movie and the other will not play at all.
B000YIGNKE|1|After Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is in line for my next favorite Jane Austen novel. I was very much pleased to learn about the new ITV production of her novels. I own the 1995 Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version and truth be told, it took me a few viewings to get used to Ciarin Hinds, but now, forgetting his perceived age, I like him. Amanda Root, I always did like, especially because of the common sense and propriety she brought to the role. Her second bloom that occurred later in this version was simply splendid.<br /><br />This ITV version is quite shocking for me. In some parts it reminded me of an earlier version of Mansfield Park where Fanny kept speaking into the camera. The Anne of this version did likewise, and it was very annoying. While Captain Wentworth's personal beauty was more appealing in this version, there was something lacking still in his performance. In fact, this entire version lacked a certain something. But I think the biggest CRINGE worthy moment for me was Anne running through the streets of Bath. That was quite shocking. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still cringe.<br /><br />Sorry, but I'll stick to my 1995 version until, perhaps, in the future Persuasion is re-done in the true spirit of Jane Austen.
B00I32KWRI|1|Just got 3 season specials charged to me (1.75 each= 5.25). Has now pushed me over what I would have paid for them at 1.99 each for the whole season. Shame Amazon. This is shady. I've not had this problems with other subscriptions in the past and won't be using Amazon prime to purchase access to active TV shows againl<br /><br />the show, of course, is awesome though.
B000W4D27C|5|Remember when \\"FluXion\\" and \\"Aeolian\\" were first meant to be released as a double album, yet it ended up that they were released as two separate albums, yet people didn't mind? Well, two years after \\"Aeolian\\", we have \\"Precambrian\\", a concept double album based around the earliest known times from thousands of millions of years ago, yet described in abstract form to make things less obvious.<br /><br />The first disc, known as \\"Hadean/Archean\\" can easily be called an EP, as it clocks in at 22 minutes. These songs are in an aggressive style for the band, with its share of polyrhythmic structures and everything usually has the pace picked up. It gets you ready for the second disc, which they call \\"Proterozoic\\". This is definitely the superior disc, not just because of length, but because everything is executed so flawlessly by a large soundscape of crushing guitars, violins, piano, drums, and other various forms of percussion, including the xylophone and the chimes. Each song is written is a beautiful and structured matter, yet it retains that aggression that \\"Hadean/Archean\\" had you pumped up with.<br /><br />If you want to listen to this album in the best way, play it from beginning to end. This isn't an album meant for shuffle, or an album with any singles on it, it's a breathtaking concept album with a very dynamic performance.
B003XF1XOQ|4|Liked the book, but it was much slower read than the first two.  I didn't love the ending, either. Overall, it summed up the series. Must read if you read the first two!
B0017I1IZA|4|This was probably the last really good one in the Plum series.  After 8, she starts to go downhill.  I still read them, because I just love the characters!
B008JGSM6G|5|great way to pass the time.  starts easy and gets more challenging as you go.  and the price is definitely right.  fun for all ages.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Impressively documented, and vividly written, &#34;Dead Wake&#34; is a great read and an example of the best kind of of non-fiction writing.  It does a great job of reviving interest in a sea-faring tragedy that had historic significance beyond the loss of a huge ocean liner.  Larson makes that point without in any way losing the thrill of a complex, compelling story.  I am sorry I have read it already since I wish I could read it again!
B00DIJQAI6|2|Bad controlling

0763644765|3|its not much of a potty book.  But it is cute and my son likes to look at the undies but overall not a great book for potty training or even just reading.
B000008M1P|5|their albums are the greatest and they need to be out so they can be gotten easier i always liked the music since the first time i heard it and now want to get it but its hard to find
B0014XCMVM|4|I think Alanis is such an amazing artist, such a spiritual and moving life force, and such a great musician and songwriter that she requires little in terms of production to feature her at her best.  Here, she returns again with intimate, thought-provoking music about where she is in her life, and where she wants to be.<br /><br />For me, however, the arrangements and production tricks distract, and do not enhance, the overall experience.  Is there any need to \\"modernize\\" Alanis?  I don't think so -- she is so singular, so sui generis, that all that is needed is to set up the mikes and get out of the way.<br /><br />So, with that caveat, she has again managed to make an incredible musical statement, and of course her muse and message comes through loud and clear, production gimmicks or not.
B00IIUATDM|5|Almost a porno!! Pretty awesome movie!! Sex, money and drugs!!
B000OLGCI4|5|A totally joyous ride and a classic.  The Bear Necessities of Life- (yes that's where the song comes from ).  My young boys love it and I really enjoy watching it with them.
B002V9PEU4|5|During the better half of 1980's and 1990's, action movies were huge, and even that can be considered a vast understatement. Full of explosions, cheesy one liners, and over the top characterizations, this genre was just BEGGING for a parody. While &#34;Hot Shots! Part Deux&#34; did an admirable job, Last Action Hero is the absolute &#34;last word&#34; on the subject of &#34;action movie parodies&#34; as it takes an already takes an established &#34;beefcake&#34; action star like good ol' Arnie and thrusts him into the spotlight as the mega-hit cop hero, Jack Slater.<br /><br />The film centers around a delinquent kid named Danny who skips school constantly so he can watch movies (namely Jack Slater Films) in a rundown theater run by a kindly old man. The old timer offers to show Danny an advance screening of the latest Jack Slater film provided he attends school. And he does so after being mugged in his own home and having day dreams of Arnold (who also plays himself along with Jack Slater) starring in a much more action oriented version of the film adaptation of Hamlet during class. When Danny arrives at the cineplex, he's given a magical ticket by the old man who says that it was given to him by Harry Houdini. Later on, while Danny is enjoying the movie, the ticket sparkles and he's instantly thrust into the celluloid world of Jack Slater who's hot on the case of Tony Vivaldi. And jesus, this film plays &#34;homage&#34; to so many action film tropes that it is quite honestly INSANE. Cops dying three days before retirement, the henchmen double crossing his incompetent boss. the hero getting his badge revoked during an important case, etc, etc, etc<br /><br />The tropes are openly mocked as well as celebrated and I feel is the biggest underlying theme of this movie: the celebration, not mockery, of action movies. And what's strange is how many people see Arnold's other film &#34;Commando&#34; (1985) as a parody movie (namely Doug Walker, alias &#34;The Nostalgia Critic&#34;) and view &#34;Last Action Hero&#34; as some shlocky mess of a film that can only be laughed at &#34;ironically&#34;.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like Action Movies and a good bit of satire, get Last Action Hero
B000MV8XPG|4|it wasn't quite as easy to assemble as i expected.<br />but given its complexity, the rather clumsy way it shifts from 'up' to 'down' seems unnecessary.  why not a continuous control?<br />the little boy to whom it was given is delighted (as is his big sister).
B001AGXEAG|5|I know this version of beetlejuice has not been realesed yet but still it is the movie. michael keaton portrays bettlejuice in the right manner. this movie is one for the whole family. it's a must see. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.

B008673ZAQ|4|I really like this book. And I am patiently waiting for the last book of the series! I just want them to get and stay together making it work!
B00BMT9C84|5|It hits home with so many of us whose parents are older and still want to guide us.  Very funny, we laughed and even shed a tear once.
1416562605|4|I was very impressed with Arvind Adiga's first book. I wouldn't say that it is the most well written book, but I enjoyed the story and his portrayal of the social and economic inequalities in India through this work of fiction. I found myself rooting for the protagonist in this rags to riches story. It was one of those books that I struggled to put down....a riveting read.
B004SUWR2C|5|I believe this app is reasonably priced and fun to use. Plus it is a good time wasting game while waiting at the doctors. I just wish I could have waited a little and got it at .49 instead of .99. (lol I'm frugal.)
B00H58VGIA|5|Another wonderful book by Sue Monk Kidd! Beautifully written, I loved every minute of it. A look at the horrors of slavery, the relationships between mothers and daughters, between sisters...loved it.
B00632HWOG|5|Love it!
B007QA3AH2|5|great cast and funny spoof on space adventures. Tim Allen et all are great. Special effects are good . no brainer for relation
0763619612|5|I read this book to my adult students when I teach an art class  The message is that there are no mistakes or bad art.  It helps people to lighten up and let go!
B00005R5G9|3|Women may enjoy the romantic, hopeful elements of the story.  Check the reviews on this movie.  Everyone is correct.  Obvious, silly, with a screenplay that sounds like it's written by a high school male - performances are broad and cartoonish.  All participants are a stereotype.<br />However, on closer scrutiny, the real villains in this movie are not the conniving men, but the shallow, bitchy women.  One frustrated clown, articulates the theme - surrounded by beautiful women, he cries out that he wants a mannequin.  That is, a kind, woman who can nurture.  That's the irony and the romantic appeal of the movie.  A nerd lucks out by finding love with a beautiful phantom soul.<br />I should know better, but I like this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5|This game is very fun and way better than the first one it has nice graphics and fun mechanics great game please try it now guys.

B00005JO1Y|2|Ann weeps buckets for poor Kong, while dozens die trying to save her; blondes in New York who aren't Ann are callously tossed aside in a manner that makes you laugh, except it isn't funny; the bones of his previous \\"brides\\" indicate they were ripped limb-from-limb.  But, you know, poor Kong.  <br /> <br />The \\"ick\\" factor was remarkably high, especially the bugs and the pink snake things. <br /> <br />And pretty much every scene was too long.  EVERYTHING seemed to go on and on and on.  And they spent so much time with the minor characters that you cared about them and that made it harder as they kept on getting knocked off. <br /> <br />I thought the cgi was good and realistic (there is such a variance it's amazing to me...the Hulk never looked real for one minute, Kong looks good).  And the acting was pretty good, including Jack Black (after all the character is meant to be broad).  <br /> <br />The trouble with everything taking so long is that you start to lose that essential suspension of belief.  Early on I'm thinking that ship is too small to take Kong back to NY.  The ship takes quite a pounding on the rocks, but then all is well without going to a drydock.  How do the villagers live exactly on all that bare rock?  The ape moves in true ape fashion (on all fours) but then is carrying Ann in its front feet and she doesn't get mashed to a pulp?  How come Ann doesn't get hypothermia (not to mention goose-bumps) being out in all that cold weather in her sleeveless dress for a long damn time, not to mention the wind at the top of the Empire State Building.  I know I'm nit-picking, but a movie has to have some logic (or at least live within the boundaries of its own particular story logic).   <br /> <br />Sorry, I think Peter Jackson is capable of better.  Oh and by the way, do the women in his life have no influence?  Stop making movies so damn long with no intermission, ie: bathroom break!
1401324649|5|I'm hardly ever disappointed reading an international best seller and this was no exception.  It made me smile and made me think of the dear ones I've known who would have done anything to find a window, climb out, and disappear.  I've given this books as a gift.  I'm smiling just thinking about it.  BAB
B0059XTUEK|5|Marilyn Monroe was still a huge star when I reached my teens just as &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34; was being filmed in 1957. I had a huge crush on her...just as most kids my age and older. I saw many of her films in the theater back then and have viewed most of them since. She was a huge star of course (ranked #6 among all female actors by AFI) and sex symbol; and with the right role and direction, she was also an excellent actress. I never knew back then how troubled and fragile and insecure she was; how difficult she was to work with; or about her prescription drug and alcohol abuse. This film is only a mini-biopic of Marilyn, but it does a great job of portraying her as she was in 1957, when she had already started down the road that led to her premature death. Michelle Williams, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Monroe, and is also drop-dead gorgeous, performs masterfully in the title role. Eddie Redmayne, in a breakout performance, also performs superbly as the young starstruck assistant director, Colin Clark, who is assigned to keep up w/Marilyn; and in the process, gains her confidence and falls in love w/her. The story is fact based, adapted from Clark's two books on his time w/Marilyn in 1957. The director and co-star of &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34;, was the great actor, Sir Lawrence Olivier, played by Kenneth Branagh, in his usual outstanding manner. Also look for excellent performances from Judi Dench who plays actress, Sybil Thorndike; and Emma Watson, in one of her first roles outside the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; series; as a wardrobe assistant, who is Colin's love interest before and after his week with Marilyn. This is a great film...one of the 10 best of 2011 in my opinion.
B00BWBHIUG|2|seems to need internet connection to work well..we use the kindle in the car alot, so doesn't fill the need.
B00003CXI1|5|I am a huge fan of everything Potter and very much enjoyed the film. I was thrilled that as it was a British book, set in britain and written by a Brit, that it was kept this way through out. Not that im slating other countries and their films, it was just so refreshing that it was all kept as it should and was in the book. I cant wait for the next book and for chamber to be released on film. Naturally there were many scenes left out and a few things changed for the film, but if they had put everything in the film, it would have had to be at least 4 hours long.<BR>Bravo Harry, cant wait to see you again!!
B0002ZDVEU|5|I love this movie. I have seen only a few parts of this movie on TV and wanted to finally see the whole movie. Now that I have, I loved it and will see it again and again.
B0088WK27S|5|Title threw me off on this one, however: this is a great find.

B00QLVY7J2|3|I like this game.  However, it gets &#34;glitches&#34; as you're playing.  Otherwise, it's a good game.
0547995660|2|Didn't like it. There were several things that did not make sense wherein the author described a certain state of being which was later contradicted by the actions of one or more of the characters. In addition, the ending was so abrupt i was left feeling that the author either could not come up with a reasonable ending so just abruptly cut it off, or the author left it hanging in mid air on purpose to leave an option to write a sequel.  Either way, it felt like the end of a chapter rather than the end of a novel.  The idea for the book was great, it was simply poorly executed.
B007N31ZLA|5|great flick ! even better in bluray,
B004EPZ03E|5|There is singing, dancing and a storyline. I can't remember if I saw this one. Not scary. Good for kids.
0062101897|5|A+A+A+ Thanks!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5|One of the best books I've read recently.  The story is a a lot of fun and the book was difficult to put down.  I can't wait for his next book.
B00004T9UH|5|I think that any person in their right mind should have this cd. It is so emotional. Eminem does swear a lot in this cd, but that's just his way of expressing his feelings. He is a wonderful rapper, and this cd is definatly  worth the money that you'll pay for it!
B002QE3CTY|5|Captivating from start to finish.
B004G600A4|5|Appeals to both kids and adults as most Disney movies do. Very funny and fun to watch. due to a 5 year old I have watched it dozens of times.
B00CDXOXB4|3|I was a domestic violence counselor for 24 years, so I know a little bit about the world of abusers and victims. I also know it is almost impossible to run away and permanently hide from a person determined to hurt you. I've seen lots of movies about family violence and read a dozen or more non-fiction treatments of the problem. Therefore, movies such as \\"The Burning Bed\\" and \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" and \\"Safe Haven\\" sometimes are problematic for me. In real life, the women in danger are not  usually movie-star attractive, and don't have professional writers giving them good job skills or irresistable personalities. The male abusers are less often respected professionals and more often substance-abusing low self-esteem marginal achievers. Are there exceptions to both of my depictions? Of course. But in domestic violence films, reality is simplified for the sake of a two-hour tale. And as a two-hour tale of a frightened woman's bid to escape an obsessed bully, \\"Safe Haven\\" is enjoyable and tense. No masterpiece, not the finest script ever penned, not the most superb acting you'll see this year, but not a waste of time. The twist ending will seem hokey five minutes after the credits roll, but for me, when it was revealed, it not only worked, it was the best thing about the whole production. I \\"retired\\" from the world of domestic violence prevention more than four years ago, and am glad to be distanced from the ugliness and tragedies of that problem. It's damned hard to reform the abusers, and surprisingly difficult to help victims make permanent, safer, healthier changes and choices. If a movie like this helps one victim decide to get away sensibly, or one abuser elect to get professional help before he ends up in jail or dead, it was worth making and watching.
B001GM7GO4|1|Remastered, that is. This item is beautifully packaged but the sound is unchanged from the 1986 original which was poor even then! Compared to the recent remasters of the first 2 Boston albums, this is a total disaster and the supposed SHM adds nothing. Buy only if you're a (rich) completist.
B0007P3582|4|I hate people who just skim through a album with out listening to it. I admit I did the same thing and didn't like the album at first, but after actually listening to it this album its kinda dope. So stop hatin on 50 and G-Unit cause they runnin the game right now
B00UHQ73NO|5|I love this group!

B009EELKMA|5|This is a great movie.  It has fairly good drama and a lot of good Christian sense as exhibited by the Hospitaler knight.
B00BAXFAOW|4|This is one of Gladwell's most interesting books. He does a great job of presenting evidence that challenges commonly held notions about supposed advantages and disadvantages, and I took a lot away from that. Great read

B007W8S2MG|5|There are alot of vita games out there now and p4g is definately the best so far.
B00TPEMK3M|4|I enjoyed the twist on childhood stories.  The movie played in dark background but.. I guess it was for effect.  Overall I enjoyed it.
0062218336|5|Consider reading the entire series. If you want to give insight to what economist can do for society this is one for your library.
B009NQKPUW|3|Was expecting more out of this film..I did not think the cast went well together. Seemed like the story line was a little odd
B002MQYOFW|5|My teenage grandson suggested that I read this trilogy - and I was so pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed the story as well as the writing style. The premise is horrifying - a world very changed from the one we know today - but we also thought Orwell's \\"1984\\" was a stretch of the imagination, and now we see parts of it in our daily lives. I am looking forward to seeing the movie version of this book.
B000002J03|5|Led Zepplin 2 helps to show the band at its peak and helps to create a  hard rock sound based on American blues. From Whole lotta love to bring it  on home, this album keeps a hard rock pace and it is easy to understand why  this is such an influencal hard rock album. The best tracks on the album  are whole lotta loave, ramble on and living love maid.

B000F0UUT6|5|The producer and director set out to recreate Jane Austin's world and her people, and they succeeded.  The loving detail of place, form, color, music, dance and acting in this glorious production brilliantly projects the viewer into the early 19th Century world of the landed gentry - a dreamland of beauty and wit. <br />The acting, (with the unfortunate exception of Allison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett who overacts shamelessly, and sounds like a rusty saw scraping on metal), is so superior to anything an American could see on television, that it is like entering a new plane of existence.  Best are Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, although the actors who played Ms. Lucas and Mr. Bingly were also terrific. <br />Great extra features, too, although I would have LOVED an interview with Colin Firth, who is to die for! <br />If you haven't seen it, you are a deprived person!
0765325950|5|Drop the bad reviews, they are not reviewing the book they are lamenting the delayed ebook release.  Every single 1 star review is only because there is not a digital copy yet.  Want to give negative feedback on it then send the publishers an e-mail or letter.  Save the whining and negative feedback for after you read the book (if there is any).  If you were truly fans of the series then you wouldn't bring the ratings of this book down in such a manner.  I am giving it 5 stars to help offset the inconsistent rating.
B00A9C3RB8|3|I think it did a great job of addressing problems with older couples.<br />Plenty of good humor throughout the movie.
B00C8S9W0G|5|I have read most her Outlander books and I would recommend them ALL as great reads but caution that there is bad language.  These are for adults only to read but all in all good books.
B003IDMUVI|5|wow what a fantastic book .I cant believe how brilliant an author John Grisham is .This book kept me thoroughly engaged until the last page .I highly recommend this book.
0515123447|5|Before I saw this book at the bookstore I had never heard of Lee Child.  I am glad a stumbled upon this book and the others he has written.  Jack Reacher, the main character is an ex-military drifter who seems to be just making his way around aimlessly.  He ends up in some sticky situations and making unlikely friends.<BR>If you like a good plot, quick pace and imaginative writing style you will like Lee Child's &quot;Killing Floor&quot;.
B007IXWL2C|5|read through the books so quickly cause i couldn't get enough and now going back and re-reading at a slower pace to see what i skimmed over before.  good read.
B000FC1MCS|5|I saw the play in London (amazing staging and production) first, then read the book - both are very close with regard to script.  One of the best reads I've had lately!  It is so uniquely told through the voice of the narrator.  I've known peole like him and it was so true and so captivating.  One of the best!
6305291446|4|I've always enjoyed the Halloween movies, but in the past there have been mistakes. However, H20 tries to fix that, by offering a good dose of horror. The beginning is somewhat weak, and seems like the director added it in to up the body count, but still you have to start somewhere. After the first two murders occur[ one being very gruesome, in which a character gets an ice skate shoved through his face]. The cops flock to the murder scene, and discover that Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse has been murdered, and that the file on Laurie Strode has been stolen. We then go to a prep school in California, where it is one day before Halloween, and Miss Strode is having quite a hard time recovering over what happened 20 years ago. She is the headmistress of a private school, and we meet her son Josh. Josh is very annoyed by her mother's overprotectivness. It doesn't help that it is one day before Halloween. Josh wants to go on a camping trip, but can't seem to persuade his mother to let him go. So, him and his friends decide to arrange a gettogether at the prep school after everyone else leaves, but Josh's mom decides to let him go to the camping trip, so he takes the slip but doesn't leave. Laurie then discovers that Halloween night that her sons camping items are still in the house and comes to the realization that Josh is in trouble, and her brother is coming back to get him. It is at this point that what we have all been waiting for happens. Michael shows up at the school. In this movie, Laurie finally conquers her fears and faces her maniac brother. Good acting, good writing, and all in all a good movie. I had to give it 4 stars because the middle is a little slow in some parts, and the movie entirely ignores 4, 5, and Curse, but some people may enjoy that.  Rated R: violence, gore, sexual content  Body Count: 8  Best Death: dumbwaiter crush, or ice skate in face
B00ILHW6AG|1|BORING!
B0000009XP|5|Buddy Guy's best album imo ...The title song ,I Smell A Rat ,<br />the Hendrix flavored You've Been Gone Too Long , the blues/rock ditty She's Out There Somewhere , Buddy's take on the old Louis Jordon classic Outskirts of Town , the bluesy Are You Losing Your Mind and When I Left Home...all killer . Six songs in total of some of the best blues tracks ever laid down . If you like raw gritty blues this is one of the best of it's genre .
0385738773|1|I cannot believe how utterly bad and horrible this book was! The first book, The Maze Runner, was one of the best sci-fi books I've read in a while. It had everything I loved about the beginning of Lost - a great mystery and a creepy environment to explore. The pacing was good and the characters, while not completely fleshed out, were believable.<br /><br />Then I read the second book. A lot more information came out and some of the mystery was gone. At this point, I was just trying to figure out whether they were in a virtual reality system or the real world. I got what WICKED was about. It was pretty obvious.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Where the cracks started showing in the second book was the rotten decision by Dashner to replace Teresa with Brenda. As a female reader (who identified with Teresa in the first book), it felt like Teresa was just being discarded for a new cutie. And the whole thing about Thomas hating her because she was forced to imprison him by WICKED was just silly and not realistic.<br /><br />So, in the third book, after totally hating on Teresa for her &#34;betrayal,&#34; Thomas has NO PROBLEM with learning that Brenda had been an employee of WICKED all along. Are you kidding me?! He puts his life in her hands, no questions asked, no anger at her lying, and realizes he actually likes her (not Teresa) and barely bats an eyelash when Teresa is crushed under a rock after saving him.<br /><br />I had to wonder what sort of bizarre ex-girlfriend issues Dashner had after reading that. Just awful. Bloody awful.<br /><br />And that's just the most egregious example of poor characterization in this book. The rest of the book is just a stupid zombie apocalypse rip-off with Thomas and co running around like chickens with their heads cut off, reacting rather than acting, magically being connected with a resistance group, and not stopping to question if the resistance group could really be trusted even though the group violently kidnapped them.<br /><br />Then the leader of the resistance group trusts Thomas with the most important part of the mission - planting the weapon disabling device. Seriously?<br /><br />So the resistance group goes ahead and blows up WICKED, not caring that they are going to kill all the Immunes there, and Thomas is miraculously saved in a deux ex machine where the Chancellor writes him a letter and sends him to a &#34;safe place&#34; through a magical portal.<br /><br />I read through this entire book of schlock hoping beyond hope that the ending would justify the stupidity - that Thomas had been in some sort of coma and manipulated by WICKED the entire time...but nope. WICKED just let him run around apparently to weed out more healthy people so they could send the best and the &#34;smartest&#34; through the portal.<br /><br />If this is how Dashner thinks &#34;smart&#34; people would act, I can't imagine how he'd write stupid people.<br /><br />The only theory I can come up with to justify all the brutality and stupidity in this book is that I'm explaining it to myself that everyone at WICKED (including the Chancellor) has the Flare and is seriously psycho.<br /><br />Otherwise it makes no sense.<br /><br />I honestly wish I had not read this book. I loved the first book, thought the second was decent, but am now so turned off by book three that I don't feel like I want to read the prequel. And Thomas? I can't stand the character now. I almost wish he'd been the one crushed by a rock at the end. Argh.<br /><br />PS I am not one of those folks who hated the ending of Lost. While it was disappointing on an informational level, the ending of Lost - to me at least - was emotionally powerful and beautiful. Not the ending of The Maze Runner series. This was just written so it would look good on a big screen and the Maze could be destroyed with a lot of CGI special effects.br /><br />Then the leader of the resistance group trusts Thomas with the most important part of the mission - planting the weapon disabling device.

This was just written so it would look good on a big screen and the Maze could be destroyed with a lot of CGI special effects.
B000093BDX|5|Love the music
B009UX2YAC|5|didn't like this game just not for me
B00E8KLWB4|4|This is a game that is enjoyable.  The different picture styles make it more interesting, and the changing formats keep it from being boring. You can keep playing and advance without spending money.  One game I'll keep playing.
161655570X|5|Being a fan of the game (before it was even released!), This was a must-have!^^<br />It is full of lots of details regarding characters, monsters and the stages design along with their backgrounds! :)<br />Totally loved the high-quality of this art book as well! &#60;3
B002NXSRVG|5|They make everything in this film become so cool. I feel like every single movie series, the first one is the best.( except some films).
B00009TB5G|5|I picked this up about 3 days ago and I was pleasantly surprised as to how awesome this set is.The extended version is the only version worth seeing because it has alot of great extra scenes which were taken out of the original.Alot of really good extra features like commentaries and still galleries.I would recommend getting this one instead of the previous edition.I cant wait to see the return of the king.
B000V1US2S|4|Great and beautiful compilation!  The labels are too beauty and the sounds of record's fine!  I recommend this álbum for all jazz lovers!
B009DE11X4|5|Great books
B006LSZECO|5|I don't even like crime stories or mysteries but I heard the hype about this book and said what the heck, i will read a sample and then move on. I couldn't stop reading it, i ended up getting it through the library so I could listen to it in the car on a long trip, and it had me enthralled, questioning and being exasperated, and wondering who to route for and who to hate, and then the wild crazy twist at the end caught me by surprise, it was a wonderful neurotic read and although it was dark, there were so many moments of acknowledging how crazy we all are and how love can make us nuts. I now have to find another book that whisks me away like this one did....what a great read!!!
B00E647F9A|4|Bluray is nice and the directors cut adds some good footage. If you havent seen the first, its a good movie, if you have youll be a lottle let down.
B00IS87HYI|4|cute, a lot like candy crush sega.
B000HEWEEY|4|While the look is dated it is wonderful, fun to watch, classic old-style sci-fi...could hardly ask for better.
B00AZNEW5G|4|This is a good movie.  Maybe too much truth and maybe not enough truth  = not sure which.  Still worth watching and would certainly recommend it.
0802130208|5|How anyone can honestly say they did not think this book funny, and that they did not laugh out loud,  I simply cannot understand.  I have read hundreds maybe thousands of books in my long life, and this is the best of the fiction.  Too bad it has not yet been made into a movie.
B000W7JWUA|5|This is a well manufactured game, fun to play. Play time is just right, leaving you eager for the next game.
B008QPCCQQ|5|See my review of &#34;The Bronte Sisters&#34; collection.  I love all of these books and stories.
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved it.
B009NFHF0Q|5|I didn't find this book to be as slow as some reviewers complained.  It's true that it is slower paced than his earlier work, and seems much more personal -- I can't remember another book that he's written in the first person.  It's a lovely, thoughtful book, and still has Gaiman's trademark creepiness, although not so much humor as much of his work.  I recommend it highly -- just don't expect it to be an &#34;American Gods&#34; or &#34;Anansi Boys&#34; clone.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I was sad to reach the end of this book, the end of the trilogy. I just loved these books. Very well written.
B00DR0PDNE|1|dont waste your money!
B0012GMUI6|5|I remember as a schoolboy some thirty odd years ago, our music teacher playing a few \\"Floyd\\" tracks, and asking us what we thought they meant? How does it make you feel? Well, he may have well been asking us about quantum mechanics and how it all worked.... We didn't have a clue, and why should we, we were after all just school kids,  we had no concept of  most of what they sang about, and didn't much care. If he were to ask me now, well maybe I would be able to answer him, at least in part anyway.<br /><br />This isn't \\"pop\\" music, it isn't \\"easy listening\\", it is a tapestry, a work of art, something to immerse yourself in, and if you are lucky, or unlucky, depending on your point of view, you will see and maybe understand where Mr Waters is trying to take you, and maybe you can empathise with the characters.<br /><br />I started to seriously \\"listen\\" to Floyd and Waters (Post Floyd) about twenty years ago. I find for me that it is (all) best enjoyed alone, when I am feeling mellow, maybe with a glass of scotch or a \\"special\\" cigarette....... The depth of emotion that this music can bring forth is astounding. In a darkened room, a quality sound system, no distractions... well it has taken me places far more than any movie ever could. Yes, I wish my old music teacher would ask me again how it makes me feel.<br /><br />I'm not saying you need to have a few years of good life experience to enjoy the music, there are after all some stunning sounds here, but to fully appreciate it in its entirety, I would say that it helps.
B008XG1X18|5|thank God for this app love it!!!!! I cant stay off of it lol it force closes a lot tho
0143034901|3|This book promises a lot more in the first half than it is able to deliver in its second half.  Zafon vividly sketches about a dozen major characters in 1940s Barcelona but they become less and less believable as he pushes them toward the finish line.  By the end, it seems like every single encounter is dominated by moody Silences of the Doomed.<br /><br />Plus, despite its setting, the book has almost nothing to say about the Catalan people, which is quite an amazing feat for a book set in Barcelona!
B00DUGCLY4|3|the game was just ok..but was shocked to have finished the game in such a short time give or take 20min. some of the pics, however, were a little kiddish and some didn't make sense.
B0011UJMK2|5|I read (far too many?) crime mysteries and thrillers -- this one was stellar. Un-put-down-able. The plot is naturally gripping when dealing with a society that has had it drilled into their minds that no one can be trusted. \\"Check on those we trust\\" is a phrase heard often in this story and what a telling phrase that is to paint the picture of this time.<br /><br />I was even further interested in the plot when I found out that Smith was referencing a true crime that occurred in Russia during the 70's; serial murderer Andrei Chikatilo. His crimes alone make for a compelling story but when set in a Russia where crime has been officially eliminated due Communism's \\"fairness\\" it makes investigating these crimes a crime itself.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn and you are engaged in their stories from the beginning. No one is safe so every action has double the suspense. One of the best parts of this book is that it is a part of a Trilogy meaning I knew I would be able to spend more time with these characters I came to know and care about.<br /><br />Please read this book. Not only will it make you supremely happy to live in the times and under the government that you do but the price is a steal!
B003G4W49C|5|Definitely in my top 10 favorite books of all time. I re-read it at least once a year. If you are thinking about reading this - DO IT and then read Ender's Shadow.
B003M70O5O|5|Best series I've watched
B00BUCXVPI|3|Very good, basic Tom Cruise movie.  Writing style is very predictable, though at the same time, we enjoyed it.  It was very appealing for an evening.
078322737X|5|Please believe me!  I was 17 during the summer of '62, and this excellent movie seems more like a dream than an actual film.  It captures the feelings, the personalities, the innocence better than any film of this type.  George Lucas' lighting and pacing throughout this wonderful film casts a surreal, dreamlike feeling.  The characters are believable, despite a cast of future all-stars.  There's the common guys like Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss, the nerds, the hoods, and the local hot-rod legend. Even Harrison Ford makes his debut as a redneck hotrodder named Bob Falfa.  McKenzie Phillips plays the typical 13-year-old.  The music soundtrack features many of the 50's and 60's great hits with a hint of reverb adding to the dreamlike atmosphere.  A poignant film, that leaves you emotionally drained at the end. Anyone who doesn't like this film must have no romance in their soul.  Stick to WWF.  This is one of the all-time greats!
B00L8OBCQS|4|Action packed. But still lacked more story.
B000QXDED6|5|This is a great story yet a bit graphic. Really loved this movie and a great addition for collectors.
B007FG9LIE|5|Not going to say a lot, but a great book with many twists.  Read it over two flights in one day and couldn't put it down!  A great, quick read!
B004DLPXAO|5|Kindle helps me to buy and read books instantly.  I also have an online library accessible anytime, anywhere.  You need to download it.
B008XBCJ34|5|It was everything i remember when i first saw it in the theatre.The color and depth were terrific in my own living room.
1603427244|5|Photographs of each methods make information very clear. Very practical information. I love this book and I will be referring to it often. It's great that it is spiral bond so you don't have to hold it open while you knit. I'm really glad I bought this book.
B001SO69IY|4|Method Man & Redman return after almost 10 years since their last collabo album and 7 ½ years since their \\"How High Soundtrack\\" with a very solid 4 star album.  After being in the rap game for 16+ years most know what to expect when these 2 get on the mic and when they collaborate on songs. I think this album is a notch aboue the first \\"Blackout!\\" album (which I'd also give 4 stars).  I do like their solo works better than their collaboration albums, most of their solo's I'd give 4.5 stars.  This one has some funnier tracks and some smoking tracks as well as some nice lyrical ones too.  Of the 15 songs, 2 are ok and the other 13 are good or real good songs but there is no classics on here.  Guests are on 4 songs rapping and doing the chorus on 4 others.  Production is solid as well.  Rockwilder & Erick Sermon each do 2 songs, Bink One!, King David, Havoc, Pete Rock, Swiff D, Nasty Kutt, Ty Fyffe, and Buckwild all do 1 song.  A nice album to have from 2 hip-hop veterans.    #1 - 8  #2 - 8  #3 - 8.5 (f/ Saukrates -- nice laid back beat)  #4 - 8.5 (funky upbeat track)  #5 - 8 (f Keith Murray, who with Method Man kill this track)  #6 - 7 (f/ Poo Bear)  #8 - 7.5  #10 - 8.5 (relaxing O'Jay's sample beat)  #11 - 9 (f/ Ready Roc & Street Life -- nice beat)  #12 - 9 (nice beat)  #14 - 8 (f/ Raekwon & Ghostface Killah)  #15 - 9 (tight beat)  #16 - 8 (f/ Poo Beaar)  #17 - 8 (f/ Melanie Rutherford)    METHOD MAN -- Clifford Smith -- b. 4/1/1971 -- b. Long Island, NY moved to Staten Island, NY  REDMAN - Reggie Noble -- b. 4/17/70 -- Newark, NJ    Check all my reviews
B001IAOEXU|5|Love the Real triggers.  They're especially helpful when you're really into a game and in the heat of action.  Great for fighters and FPSs and they give you a good reference point too for your trigger fingers.  A snap to install...literally.
B00AE2LJVS|4|Great story behind live the actors overall good job<br />I recommend anyone who likes this style of genre<br />I also gave it four cause it was pretty good
B005RJ6AIK|4|Love it.  So nice to play this cd in the evenings, sit on the porch and believe I am in Hawaii gazing at the pacific.  Beautiful music.  I like it so much I purchased a cd of all Gabby Pahanui music.
B00003CXTG|2|So there's a script for &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot; It's bad. How bad? Imagine a dog writing it. <br />Actually, Randall Wallace penned it. He wrote &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;The Patriot.&quot; These were not awful films, though neither were particularly accurate on the history front. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is more accurate, but it's like a mini-outline with a poorly conceived love triangle in the middle. <br />I've seen many 1940s movies, where actors fired off lines of wit and verve with the same energy. What is the assembled acting clan supposed to do with what passes for dialogue in this film? I don't know. Believe me, they didn't either. <br />At the centerpiece of this three-hour clambake is a 40-minute invasion sequence, where Japanese planes descend upon battleships and airfields at the Hawaiian naval base. The director, Michael Bay, of many other loud, brogue action films, has made this sequence equally loud, and things blow up over and over as planes zoom, as they must, through the same mangled set of ship wreckage and ominous flotsam. <br />How disappointing this melee of fireworks is. It's redundant for one, the action clearly dialed down to achieve a PG-13 rating. And though it's meant to be the payoff, of course it isn't, because we can barely understand the Japanese motives or strategy behind the attack, nor do we care to see Americans blown up continuously, in the exact same fashion as the last scene. <br />Consider &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for a second. Infinitely better film, but infinitely better in styling its combat scenes - it has a progression, for example, and innovation in terms of camera angles and point of view shots. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; steals all the choice shots from &quot;Ryan&quot; (the underwater cameras with bullets streaming by) and cuts at such a furious rate that the action becomes nonsensical. <br />It is for this sequence that you're watching the film at all. That it doesn't deliver is reason for disappointment. Then you must consider what is around it - a story of supreme cliche and weariness, as born pilot Rafe (Ben Affleck) falls for nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) before volunteering to fly for the British Air Force against the German Luftwaffe. He leaves behind Evelyn and best friend Danny (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot. <br />Rafe dies in action. The nurse and best friend get transferred to Pearl Harbor. Nurse and best friend spark relationship. Rafe returns (He was in occupied France! He couldn't get word! And all he thought of was Evelyn!). Anger and betrayal ensue, with more bad dialogue. The next day, they all live in infamy. <BR>We're with these simpering flakes and their romantic overtures for 90 minutes before bombs fly. This is an attempt to steal the top off another film, &quot;Titanic,&quot; which set forth a reasonable love story of some interest before iceberg, straight ahead. <br />But Wallace, said screenwriter, whiffs. One cliche, or two, fine. But when there's a lone Irish pilot in the film, when he has red hair and wee mustache, when he speaks in a thick Irish stew accent, and when his name is Ian, the line I must draw. <br />Bay hides his lack of storytelling skills by using the Jelly Belly palette of colors. I don't care if he can make a sky look nine different shades of aquamarine. How about not backlighting all scenes as if its showtime at the dinner theater? Or stopping the camera? Or refraining from the use of music better suited for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in scenes that involve the Japanese? <br />And, of course, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; ends dramatically upbeat, with the United States' pinkerton response over Tokyo on April 3, 1942, led by Captain Doolittle (a glistening Alec Baldwin) and his Raiders, of which Danny and Rafe are a part. <br />It concludes with a speech of great overstatement by Evelyn that suggests after Doolittle's raid: &quot;Japan knew nothing but defeat. And the United States knew but victory.&quot; <br />That's just the kind of history &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; chooses to serve up: that the U.S. then went on to pummel Japan at will for three years in the Pacific before dropping a couple atomic bombs in 1945 as a sundae cherry. Sure. And bats can see. <br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is an unmitigated insult to the day and the place. The romance is pitched at an eighth-grade level, so the teens might like it, but I cringe at them thinking they've learned history here.
B00QROI70S|5|All ages will enjoy this movie. The soundtrack is amazing!!
B00ENYCQX8|1|I removed this, couldn't get it to work.
B00G9U7NEQ|2|Every animated movie should have something to keep the adults entertained.  This one had 0.  I guess some are really just for kids.
B001I0T92Q|5|Genius!!!
B0034DGPEU|5|My heart aches from all the suffering. We all need to learn  how horrific slavery was. Kathleen Grissom painted the picture.
B004JN1CW4|3|I won't give anything away, but at the end both my husband and I were going, &#34;Hmmm...that was unexpected, and somewhat anticlimactic.&#34; I don't regret reading it, as once you get started on such a series, completion is all but required, however I wouldn't read the series again I don't think. Still going to go see the movies of course. We love to compare book to screen.
B00E8KLWB4|1|ILove this game I giveit a 5.  I just can not stop playing it.  I wish the energy would last longer.
B0020BUWX2|5|The ending sucked but overall the book was  very good. I enjoyed but wished the ending could have been better.
B00HERGM86|5|Movie was great, quality of the transfer, as well.  3D was well-done, too.  As to the exclusion of the DVD, this was at least a fiver less than the traditional B3D/BD/DVD/DC sets.  I generally do prefer to get a DVD, but it is not a five dollar value add to me.<br /><br />The digital copy is not itunes only anymore...you can actually redeem it on Amazon, Vudu, and Google Play.  While I have a DVD player in my car, I rarely take them anywhere...the digital copy works for that on basically anything I want to watch.<br /><br />Yes, 3D never caught on as no one wanted to buy a new TV, but really if you buy a TV today because you need to 3D is basically a low marginal amount, so why not.  I do enjoy watching movies in 3D so I get the 3D version generally for any kind of action film.
B004HXIZVC|5|Soundcloud is a good app. U can make and play wht you want. So great job to the soundcloud maker.
B005PK57IK|4|The plot lines continue to be interesting and unique. Definitely not a predictable series. I like how the individual episodes give you a sense of mystery and completion, while adding to the overall intricacies of the office, legal and personal story lines.
6300214753|5|&quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; is a classic movie about a popular troublemaker named Ferris (Matthew Broderick) and a day that he skipped high school. He gets his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), and one of his friends, Cameron (Alan Ruck), to spend the day with him. Ferris is taking the day off from high school because he wants to show Cameron what it's like to have some fun instead of being so uptight and worried about everything. Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is upset at Ferris and wants to catch him live in his act because this is the ninth school day that Ferris has missed this semester.<br />&quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; is great because it has many classic parts such as when Ferris decides to take Cameron's father's car for a ride, Principal Rooney's expedition to Ferris's house, and all the pranks that Ferris pulls to keep from being caught such as the dummy that snores in the bed. Myself, I skipped a few days in high school just because I was sick of school and wanted to take a day off. If you ever made your parents think you were sick and then they went to work and you just did what you wanted to the rest of the day instead of going to school, you'll like this movie even better. <br />I recommend anybody who likes comedy movies or anyone who ever played hookie before in high school to get &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off.&quot; Trust me, you won't be disappointed
B00G5G7EXY|5|Good movie.  Would be good for character building.
B00HXYKYIE|5|This is an insightful book about the lives of elephants, the travesties they endure from poachers and thoughtless people. Jody Picoult's writing is beautiful and touching, expressive with unique twists of humor and sadness.
B00C2VIA52|5|This game rocks. Haven't put it down since I started playing.<br />Very easy to learn and a lot of fun to play. Challenging yet not overwhelming. Other than a few cards that dont operate as they say,never have had a major problem.
0679809015|5|We've been reading this book to our 9 month old for nearly 3 months now & he loves it.  It's often the first book he'll pick up when he digs into his books.  He'll sit & look at it by himself for long periods of time & it keeps his attention the entire time we read it to him.    I was a little unsure of it when we first got it because it is so small, but it's the perfect size for his little hands.  He is not yet able to open the flaps himself, but loves to push them up when we release them for him.    A must have!
B0052RDHTM|5|I love history and love learning about wars. While this book is fiction, it also has real historical people and events that interact with the fictional characters. It follows about 5 different families all from different countries whose fate interwine throughout the book. This book it a bit lengthly but I was glued to it from beginning to end.Do not get discouraged because one chapter follows one character/ family and then the next jumps to a different character/ family, the storylines all connect! Love,family, war, drama, politics, it has everything. First book I have read by him, bravo Ken Folloett, bravo!<br /><br />ps- This is my first review ever, of anything. Thats how much I loved this book!
B00FKF0F3C|5|I honestly wasn't going to write a review until I read some of the bizarre reviews from people who may not understand that it's Follett's novel is FICTION.  Is it leftist, yes.  Is it the 100% truth,, of course not....it's fiction.  The real truth of the events is probably somewhere between the ultra right wing version and Follett's left wing version.  I have no problem with reading something that makes me think and question beliefs.<br />This novel does just that.  The characters are absorbing and multi-faceted.  The events cover my own life-span and made me think about them in ways I hadn't before.  My only complaint- I wish Follett would write a 4th novel in this series....there were unanswered questions...he stories of Alice and Walli, Cam and his wife, George's son.<br />I personally loved it and then seeing on the news this evening about the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Fascinating!
0345803507|3|Still trying to understand how this was such a huge seller.  The first one was easy to read although unrealistic with everyone so good looking or rich or both.  The last two in the series slowed down for me as it contained more unrealistic drama and the author lapses into British speak.  The story is focused on Americans in their 20's living in Seattle yet they say things like 'let me fetch you some water'.  In my head I started reading it with a British accent.  If you can find these used and you are bored then it passes the time.
0792846443|3|This was a rather terrifying film. It's contents hold every writers worst nightmare - being caught by your &#34;number one fan&#34; who is obsessed with your writings. Weil the actors themselves portray the characters like they were born to, the storyline was rather dull. Same old attempt after another, trying to get out when it's obvious he can't without assistance. Though, that's just me, anyone else who is a fan of Stephen King (hopefully not the number one fan) may say differently.
B00B5AAW52|5|It's such a wonderful TV show glad to have it in my collection.
B00J2VSS0C|3|I agree with Issovoodoo'  I am enjoying this game, but it . Is taking me a while  catch on to how you p l at the many different stages, still haven't figured how to win money without paying The Real stuff for it. GlassFish games have always been my favorite'<br /><br />JP
B00SI7GCJK|5|Best movie of 2015 and so deep and emotional that it is perfect for multiple viewings.
B005TBWN0K|5|This programs blends smoothly into Evernote and is great for getting what you see in a picture noticed.<br />Great buy!
B0067LY4WG|3|As with most CDs this one only had a couple I really like.  The rest I tend to skip over.
B004I744AS|5|Love this app. Works great on my smart phone and includes even the obscure words I often come across in my reading.
B00LPP6TWW|4|Too cute.  The computer generated cat is a punk but an adorable one.  It can be made to jump, run, turn in circles.  Easy to use once you get used to it and the graphics are clean, colorful.  Nice sound, too.  If you like cats you'll have fun with this game.  Nice for the entire family.
B007IXWKUK|5|I will admit, that after reading the first book, I felt this one to be a tad bit predictable. But that ending is something else and has me dying to start the third book!
B00992CF6W|5|ive had this for one week and I love it.I hope in next update u will be able to detonate Tnt in creative mode. but in the end it is awesome I recommend this game
B009UX2YAC|4|I only player it once.  It seems complicated and my grandson is the one who had me download it.  I played it for a while but just couldn't get into it.  I will try again and it seems that it could be addicting if you know how to play it.
1591840562|5|Guy has done a great job in presenting a difficult subject in a a serious and yet light hearted humorous fashion. His advice is much more insightful than most of the standard MBA textbooks. Reading his book is like having Guy talk to you in person. That's the way most how-to books should be written. I highly recommend this book.
0991379659|5|I bought this trilogy all in one. It is one big roller coaster of emotions and left me absolutely breathless and exhausted and wound upon edge. This book contains such unexpected twists and turns while endearing me so deeply with the characters.  This Author has a knack for making you feel like you are living the story. The characters easily come alive and are so identifiable.  I enjoyed every moment with this series and found it very near impossible to put down. I took it everywhere I went and read whenever I could find even the smallest moment to catch a page or two.  The great thing about this series is it was believable more than the others that I have read.  Many of these types of books are so far fetched that I found them hard to believe as they were out of touch with reality but this one was apart from those.  I believe that I have found my favorite author, even above Sylvia Day and I LOOOOOOOOOVE Sylvia Day. HOME RUN MS. PAIGE! You have my attention.
B001FB55H6|5|hi to everybody and sorry for my italian-english! i hope you undestand me..  well, as i said in the title, this movie, in my opinion, would deserve much more stars.  i mean, ok, there is a bunch of ralenties... my left foot cuold be able to act much better then carla cugino... the sex scenes are pretty ridicolous... it's a long and quite slow movie (a kind of Magnolia, if you know what i mean)...so every one star review has its logic, but sometimes i judge a movie from the feelings it gaves me and, well, i just finishd watching itand i still feel shaken.. anxious to watch it again and again!  i read the novel and believe me, i'm really mad about it. to be sincere, i think it's almost impossible to re-create the same atmosphere; even in a three hours movie. but mr snyder made a great job!!  to finish my review just an advice: THIS IS NOT A MARVEL HERO MOVIE!! there is violence (sometimes you could mix it up with hostel!) and bad language. kids stay back!!  so c'mon, love it or hate it!
B00IFOKUB2|5|If you're a fan of the TV series rent it!  It's great to see all the personalities back for more.
B0071XO8RA|5|Great series. I read all night to find out what happened.
B00A285OOW|5|Another great book, love this history.  Gregory makes it come alive.  You feel as if you are there living it.
B0054JZC6E|5|Awesome game!
B007FIY3VW|1|Total crap. All kinds of bugs and sometimes stuff is written in another language. Please don't waste your time on this one.
B007PF7MGS|5|This is by far the most influential and informative book if read in the past 5 years!! Its like a breath if fresh air. I've recommended this book to 7 of my closest friends and family members and all are just aa taken back as myself. I was already vegetarian and now I have taken it a step further with full and complete knowledge of things I was still doing wrong as a vegetarian. Excellent book, simply amazing!!
B00HZ3C4N6|5|great movie!
B00FGJNS72|1|Why would anyone with any self respect release such disaster?<br />The Word editor has it's problems but Excel is pathetic. First and worst is the fact that if you make any edit and save the file (to the same filename) it is no longer usable in MS-Excel. This pretty much defeats the purpose of a portable document.<br />Then in editing a spreadsheet the app is about 5% functional. While entering formulas the help dialogue covers the edit box so you can no longer see what you're doing. And if you are editing existing formulas it will sometimes revert to the original entry, even when there is no error in the edit. The cell formatting has some mysterious incompatibility and original formats are often lost and strange ones that are not even in the Polaris editor lists appear in their place. The sort list function does not work and produces a randomly reordered list. The context dialogue that appears when entering a cell disappears in 1 second so if you don't move quickly you have to re-select the cell. The app can resolve names in existing spreadsheets but if you copy and paste a formula that contains a name it becomes invalid. To make matters worse there is no way to assign or edit names for cells or ranges. No respectable spreadsheet app fails to support this feature as it is fundamental to readable functions. When using autofill the app gets stuck in function edit view and it's necessary to double click an empty cell and then hit enter to exit that mode. Sometimes when saving the changes Polaris just crashes and all work is lost.<br />I could go on for pages but it's more efficient to simply say this is the most F.U.P.O.S. that I have ever wasted my money on. If you need to edit spreadsheets don't waste your time or money on this.<br />I'm beginning to realize that Android is a toy and not to expect any sort of professionalism in apps for this OS. I will never buy another Android tablet.

B00JKGYSAI|5|Excellent
B008PE9GSA|1|I am a die hard fan,  I own multiples of everything they have ever madefrom all albums,cds, dvds, books, shirts, hats, guitar slides, strings, you name it.  I keep hoping for something decent to come out.  This cd has nothing original, no new hooks, not even decent guitar tone, what happened to the \\"Blue Jean Blues\\" tone.  It seems that the band has disengaged and is only going through the motions.  Every song starts out vocally within the first few seconds.  The vocal growl overshadows the few trickles of potential the songs have.  Dusty plays very little that that comes through and only sings a few lines.  There is one song that had a walking bass line that got me excited until the song became boring and lost the drive that can be heard on the \\"Thank you\\" from Deguello.  The arpegiated ballad was lame and and missed the mark completely,  even \\"Rough Boys\\" was far better.  What happened to \\"Hot, Cool and Rightous\\".  The producer of this album tried to get a bit of R+B but forgot how to get punch and a pocket.  I will keep buying everything thing they produce, I will keep going to their concerts, But I put an old Luther Allison album or Howlin' on the way to work and will list to Led Belly if I want to strain to understand the lyrics.<br /><br />Billy kill the ego and play some blues.
B003VANOFY|4|Love the headset, works great and is very comfortable even for somebody who wears glasses.  I've worn it for hours on end with little discomfort.  My ears do tend to need a breather once in a while.  My only complaint is the battery life.  It works great while in use but if I let them sit for a couple days not plugged in they'll be completely dead and need recharged.  Luckily you can recharge them while in use so it isn't a big deal.
0891419063|5|I've read the book and listened to the audiobook narrated by George Wilson, if that's important to you...and I'll mention what I thought of the audiobook, too.<br /><br />Anyways:<br /><br />5 stars, easily one of the best war memoirs out there. I've read quite a few, from multiple POVs and multiple conflicts. Still, Sledge beats them all.<br /><br />I would give a summary of the book but better reviewers have already done that, I'll just mention that the descriptions of life on the frontline, of combat with a fanatical enemy and in two staggeringly gruesome battles of the Pacific War are all top notch. There is one part of the book involving souvenir hunters that is just so disconcerting. The scene was in the mini-series The Pacific and it was not nearly as harrowing.<br /><br />Concerning the audiobook:<br /><br />I usually end up getting used to and enjoying most audiobook narrators and that's what happened with this one. I think the narrator (George Wilson), an older gentleman, is who is the type of narrator usually sought out for these types of books (Beyond Valor, Hell in the Pacific, Cutthroats, Code Talker and Quartered Safe Out Here all feature older narrators, the latter being the best and by the author) but I think these books would benefit from having younger or less-older sounding narrators. This is probably best exemplified by the narrators of Helmet for My Pillow or A Rumor of War or even Beyond Band of Brothers.<br /><br />tl;dr: I'd still give the audiobook version 5 stars.
B0050IY61G|5|A must for any parent with a children with asperger. Very theoretical yet incredibly practical. A reading fill with &#34;oh, that's why...&#34; moments.
B00M7UTFW0|4|Great movie!
B006LSZECO|5|Great psychological intrigue and character development. A riveting read.
B008UCJ7KO|5|once you start one of the Crossfire novel series, you can't put it down.<br />this is a fun book to read..
B001U7FWM8|2|Otherwise, I don't think you'll enjoy this album. It is slow paced, spacey, and pretty dull at times. You could have it on in the background and not even realize music is playing. That's my experience, at least.
0061714402|3|I truly looked forward to this memoir when I heard it was coming out & although it took me awhile to get to it, my<br />must read stack is awfully tall these days; once I cracked it open, the pages flew by, in this candid, self revealing & very readable, auto-bio of a gifted, but greatly damaged metal veteran.<br />Alot of the commoningly known history of \\"Damaged Dave\\" made more sense after this read, Interestingly,  his lyrical messages within his/Megadeth's music & his thoughts within the book seemed to contradict one another, time & time again, reinforcing the old adage: \\"don't believe everything you hear\\" (aka: He is as genuine as a show biz act can be!). It's no small wonder he got the boot from the Metallica boys all those years ago, as he truly out classes them in the bottom feeder department. After reading this memoir, I find it a wonder anyone will play with him in any band, or that he could be in a relationship of any kind, having so little respect for himself, let alone a partner. His arrogance is again reflected in his nation damaging, right-winger politics which loom up from page to page. I have already recommended this book to alot of others, especially fellow musicians, after which alot of us seem to be unable to listen to Megadeth anymore. Thankfully, besides creating music ourselves, there are alot other more genuine folks out there, to make up from the loss of Megadeth from our collections...
B000HWZ4A2|3|Ayn Rand is my very favorite author.  What they did to this book is a real travesty of justice.  The story line is distorted and the acting somewhat melodramatic.  With that said, it still brings out the message that is so sorely missing in todays world, how to be an individual who sticks to their principles and convictions.  Gary Cooper is great as Howard Roark and would have made a great John Gault also (Atlas Shrugged).  Pat Neal is also a joy.  If you collect Rand memories, you should purchase this title, knowing you will be disappointed in the presentation, but awed by the dynamic acting duo representing the heros of the story.
B008JFUN50|4|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Admittedly I'm pretty much a sucker for anything sci-fi, especially when it has something of a story.  It is an added bonus when the movie isn't a sequel, a spin off or anything with the words \\"trans\\" in front of it.  Director and writer Neill Blomkamp surprised Hollywood and the public with his 2009 masterpiece, \\"District 9\\" and after a well-earned hiatus gives us this follow-up.<br /><br />In the year 2154 the world has evolved into the haves and the have-nots.  The privileged and wealthy now live on a giant man-made space station orbiting Earth.  There is no poverty, no disease, no crime and life is good.  Each home comes equipped with a machine that cures any ailment including those still fatal on Earth.  Earth, or at least Los Angeles - it is the only place depicted - has devolved into a cesspool of poverty and lawlessness.  The planet is in ruins, but people still strive to survive and hope one day to make it to Elysium, the name for the space station.<br /><br />Max (Matt Damon) is just a regular guy and one of the lucky ones to have a job.  He makes the military robots that keep order on Earth for the Elysium politicians.  Max (Mad?) is accidentally exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and given 5 days to live.  Desperate, he accepts an offer from one of his old criminal allies named Spider (Wagner Moura) that will get him to Elysium for a cure.  After a grueling medical/mechanical operation, Max is equipped with an exoskeleton and brain implant that increases his physical strength and hopefully will allow him to download a station reboot program from the top programmer.  Don't ask.<br /><br />The program is meant for the evil secretary of defense, Delacourt (Jodie Foster).  Much has been made of Foster's accent which appears to be part French and part South African, but who cares.  Its 141 years in the future.  In L. A. they're speaking a combination of Spanish and English.  Let's move on.  Getting in Max's way is a henchman of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of \\"District 9\\", Sharlto Copley.<br /><br />While \\"Elysium\\" falls short of \\"District 9,\\" the flaws are not fatal.  Still, it would be interesting to know if all the other major cities/countries are like L. A. I also wondered how the world got to where they are today.  The film is beautifully shot with some chuckle-worthy product placements.  The wealthy program writer (William Fichtner) is transported between worlds in his black and red Bugatti space buggy.  Secretary Delacourt sports a nifty Bvlgary watch.  If anything Blomkamp is even more in-your-face with his politics.  While \\"District 9\\" was certainly an unveiled parable of apartheid, \\"Elysium\\" takes a broader stab at privilege with health care concerns a critical plot element.  \\"Elysium\\" is a good looking movie that moves right along with some cool action sequences.an of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of \\"District 9\\", Sharlto Copley.<br /><br />While \\"Elysium\\" falls short of \\"District 9,\\" the flaws are not fatal.

B006ID6NDQ|4|I usually read mysteries.  Sometimes I just need to read a story.  This was a nice read on vacation.  It wasn't graphic and you still got the message.  It wasn't depressing either.I thoroughly enjoyed it.  For this reason I'd recommed this easy read.
B00J9IH1RO|1|kept getting the same message over and over, not able to connect to network.  There was nothing wrong with the network, just the program.
B008YWY0HK|5|Excellent!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I really liked this book and felt that the author did an outstanding job creating very real characters.  The subject matter was obviously difficult but there was a very optimistic tone to the story.  I have several friends who asked if I felt that this book was appropriate for their ten year old children.  I would not recommend it for this age group, I think it is targeted to a more mature audience.  That being said, I thought it was an excellent story about a subject that is not frequently discussed.  I highly recommend it, to both teens and adults both.

B0093OGBL6|5|This book was incredible and gave the honor and respect to Michael Jackson that he has always deserved.  Kudos to this author. The book was &#34;Defending a King&#34;.
B001AVEJ1Y|5|Kudos to both crews. The legendary crew of The Enterprise and the crew that made this film in the Star Trek Signature that been treasured throughout the galaxy of her fans. How the writers were able to uphold that tradition while boldly going in a new direction/both at the same time seems....well,.. a no win scenario. Add to that, the characters holding true to the original characters. Add to it their coming of age as the crew together for the first time/at the same time/in the crucible of fire, ...well,...you have to to boldly go and... join the crew my freinds.    A new exemplar bar has been set for you by the new crew(s) above, upholding not only honor but the traditions of the trailblazers before them.    Therefore, a new toast is in order to the new exemplar bar, \\"Heres to the wine, women & horses, and those that mount them\\". - Bones
B0065GC0BA|5|This is a beautifully written and very thought provoking book.<br />I cried lots of tears but couldn't put it down.

B000002H6C|4|Yes, I have to admit, the production of &quot;And justice...&quot;, was not good. BUT, this album contains the pinnacle and example of good metal music,&quot;ONE&quot;. Metallica will always be Metallica from &quot;Garage Days&quot;, to &quot;S&amp;M&quot;. D

B00942Y94I|4|This is a really good and interesting movie.  We really enjoyed this movie, it is worth watching! Enjoy this one!!
B00BHU9BV6|1|What a waste of my time.  The way it was filmed & directed stunk.  The only good thing was the costume design.
B00000FC5H|5|If I could give this CD more than 5 stars I would.  I'm 23 and my mom (43) and grandma (63) were on a road trip listening to the CD.  All of us LOVED it.  This is the greatest CD of all time.
B000FC2OHA|5|The book is filled with principles that I wish I had known 40 years earlier. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of topic.

B00000I4XR|5|Scared the heck out of me in 1975 and still makes me think twice about getting in the water
B00985E3UG|5|Explains the American obesity epidemic and the forces behind it.<br /><br /> Explains how processed foods manufacturers make their products as flavorful as possible, if at the expense of good health.  In fairness, many also have sought formulas with less of the big three ingredients;  still looking . . . .<br /><br />  Most interesting to me are advertising strategies, blundering government involvement,  and parallels to nicotine and drug addiction.<br /><br />  Too much detail might put off readers (he even shows molecular formulas), but that's where you have to learn to be a scanner and skipper.
0140177396|4|Of Mice and Men is a very quintessential Steinbeck story. It has a lot of the themes of Steinbeck's other stories in \\"seed form\\". Such as the isolation of life, the essential communion between man and land, the potentially predatory nature of women, and the bitterness of events.<br /><br />In this John Steinbeck story, we follow the short tale of George and Lenny. Two friends who stick together in a cruel world, only to be eventually crushed by it's oppressive weight.<br /><br />All in all, it's a pretty good story and one of the best ways to be introduced to Steinbeck.
B000Y0Q5NM|5|Love this show
B00BRUPICM|5|I was hesitant to read this, because I believe it is a translation from French, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was one of those books I hated to put down.  For me, there were some truly unexpected but aha turns in the plot that really kept my interest.  When I was done, I immediately started looking for more from this author.  Unfortunately I found only one other translated book called &#34;Irene&#34; that is a prequel to this one, and I am going to find it and read it.  Really impressed with &#34;Alex&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Pros:<br />-the awesome price<br />-easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You need pretty good wi-fi in order to maintain acceptable viewing quality<br />-can stream YouTube and chrome web pages but nothing else<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />- My audio was a bit weird
B005ZOBNOI|4|Took me for an emotional-roller-coaster-ride!  Makes you appreciate the simple things in life.<br />I would recommend this book to everybody.
B00C3EM5J0|5|Fast delivery. Great product. Nice people. Highly recommended.
031623480X|5|Eye opening book. Makes you think about what we have been doing to our bodies over the years. Detailed information. I read this book and refer back to it almost daily.
B000FA675C|5|Love the books by Dan Brown, I  really enjoyed this book and it was a page turner for me! enjoy
B006T9PI5I|5|I have grown up watching this. It is one of the best family films of all time. Really, anyone and everyone can enjoy it! Wonderful music, wonderful acting, fantastic humor.
B009NQKXYK|4|Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic. A fascinating - and at times frustrating - film.
B000WGWQG8|5|This is compelling history.  Very well done and entertaining.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.
B006LNC3YG|4|Pantone Guide to Communicating With Color has clear visual references. A portion are illustrated, many more are shown as comparative color blocks.
B0054JZC6E|3|Not bad for 101 free games. Yeah, you need to unlock most of them, but it wouldn't be fun if you got them all at once. The main reason I continue to play is in hopes of finding one relatively exceptional game.
B000IZXR7U|1|STOOOOOOOOPID
B0000025BL|5|Yeah, I grew up listening to this album.  It has lost NONE of it's rock opera charm.  Broadway never dies, so the over-the-top sentimentality and ruthless joie de vivre of the various cuts still shines.  Imagine a fine wine growing finer with age.  Now imagine that wine as an ice-cold case of Schlitz and a fresh pack of neon condoms.  That's Meatloaf.  Bon appetit.
B0066W1AZK|5|Very poyatny interface. Good time at the picnic on the road. You can play the whole family. Choices made in the game.
B00993FEUK|4|Yes it looks at feels sorta like Coraline but I think that movie was better than this one but this is still a very good movie to purchase and watch. It's about a weird little boy that likes horror stuff and you come to find out that he can see ghosts and stuff and he has to save his town from a group of zombies and an evil spirit. Very nice stop motion too. I fully recommend it.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Not your typical hero saves the princess Disney movie. A wonderful story with lots of love! I highly recommend Frozen!
B00009V7T2|4|Does Bjiork have a twin brother? If so, He's joined up with Led Zeppelin and they've taken a serious acid trip! The former singer and guitarist of &quot;At The Drive In&quot; lead this band but drummer, Jon Theodore almost steals the show with his latin-Keith Moon vibe. A very creative album with great playing and singing, I had to play it over again after hearing it for the first time because it blew by like a raging tornado. Get it.
0684847817|5|Absolutely love it. Best purchase ever. Would highly recommend
B005QYKE2Y|3|Eh, Shia Lebouf is a great actor...but everyone was just dumb in this movie. If I'm a hot, British actress... I don't think I should stand in the middle of giant alien robots shooting each other. If I am a small human man, I shouldn't venture into the heart of Chicago, where ALLLLL the alian badguys are, to JUST find my girlfriend(although she's fricken hot).<br /><br />IT felt rushed. Good movie, but Revenge of the Fallen is way better
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I absolutely adored this book. There was so much raw emotion throughout the book it made it nearly impossible not to feel what Sky and Dean were feeling every step of the way. They found each other right when they needed one another most. I liked the \\"diary\\" format because it made me excited to get to the date that opened the first chapter to find out what was going on during that scene.<br /><br />I really look forward to reading everything Ms. Hoover writes from here on out. She did an amazing job!<br /><br />I look forward to
B0095ZMMCK|5|This has been a great series, the characters continue to evolve especially John Clark.  The young Ryan is taking after his Father in so many ways you wonder if their is politics in his future.  Mark Greaney has a Clancy like writing style but it's distinctly his own.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B0000AQS0F|5|Wonderful.  That's all I can say.    That, and bring it back.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|this is my kind of story.the twists and turns will not let y opp o<br /><br />  let you put the book down
B000XUBFE2|5|Didn't want to put it down. This book gives you a whole new perspective on the war. Everyone should read it.
B0079XPUOW|4|I picked this up as suitable beach reading, and at first it barely made the grade. But something about it kept me going and I am very glad I did. For anyone ever involved with a tv show, I say definitely read this book. For anyone who likes a little philosophy mixed in with your science fiction, this is for you. Well done, John Scalzi.
1582701709|3|Good but not up to the hype
B000XUBFE2|5|One of my favorite books.
B004XDYJRU|5|excelent i listen a lot station
B008JFUNWS|3|This film is so well made. The detail and graphics are AH-mazing! The story is filled with action and adventure. I loved how cool some of the characters were, even more so than in Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief. I would love to see a guy with 8 arms make my coffee in the morning. What a laugh that would be!<br />The hubby liked it more than I did though. He watched the whole thing where I couldn't. Here's what he had to say about it;<br /> 'The movie was exciting but more geared to teens.'<br />So there ya have it. It's a good movie for people 12-19. My son is gonna be bummed we watched it without him. At least he can watch it anytime, which I'm sure he will repeatedly.
B006MW3UZW|5|Downton Abbey is the best show on tv bar none. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out and will be hooked with one episode.
1582432678|5|I was quite simply blown away by this novel, and I am not often blown away.  First, Shriver's characters are wonderfully realistic, with the exception really of Kevin, they are not all good or all bad.  They are, as life is, far too complicated to be all black or all white.  The debate about which shade of grey each one of us is, is the heart of this novel.<br />The writing is really wonderful.  The descriptions are gripping and bring realistic details to the entire story.  As noted above, all of the characters are at once likeable and unlikeable, sypathetic and unsypathetic.  It is a difficult stance to take throughout the book, but she maintains it.<br />The plot is terrific, and even when I was sure I knew what would happen, I was still quite shocked at the shocking parts.  Its a nice thriller on top of its literary quality.<br />Finally, Shrivers questioning of motherhood, and the unrelenting nightmare of giving birth to a psychopath, are timely and sensative.  She speaks the truth, the hard truth, the ugly truth, but this truth is beautiful because it IS the truth.
B00003CXAT|5|This is pure entertainment at its best.  This was one of the greatest movies to come out of 1993.  It had action and the special effects were great.  The dinosaurs looked so real, I was really scared when I saw it in movie theatres.  If you want a movie you really want to enjoy then this is the movie for you.  The next two sequels proved to be far less entertaining and more boring than the original.
B0046MOV8U|3|I thought The Beyonce experience was a much more REAL concert video.   This is good, but will make you feel like you are watching a produced video, lots of flashing back and forth between different venues, was giving me a headache.
B00CL66FEQ|4|My daughter and I enjoyed this movie. It made us laugh. It's sweet.
B00IMYSCR4|1|Inaccurately portrays physics (what do we care, right) and as a bonus, has boring monologues and rants by Bullock.<br />Castaway it is not, character development not in lexicon of writers.  Strongly recommend eating the popcorn and not watching the movie.
B00M7URUUE|1|This movie takes &#34;I liked the book so much better&#34; to a new level&#34;.  It was<br />One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
B005LJK3AC|4|I love when movies like this come out. They are basically just funny and a lot of fun to watch. The movie keeps it light and doesn't get too serious. There are many good laughs, this would make a great party or movie night with friends. Check it out!
1401216676|5|Another must-have for any true of the Batman! Ever wonder how and why the Joker came to be? This has your answers! I'm not sure if this is a strict canonical origin, but it might as well be. Great illustrations, great story, and also includes an interesting mini-story at the very end! As I read this I couldn't help but feel like this would be a great animated movie that DC could crank out (since that seems to be the thing to do lately). Awesome paneling, detailing, and coloring, and even black and white flashbacks into the Joker's past! This book is worth every penny!
B0081SRJSY|4|Based on the board game, you can now play Carcassonne anywhere - even when you're out of table/floor space! A 4-player game moves relatively quickly. It's a little easy to beat, but fun.

B00GRPD0J0|5|Versatility and ease of use.
B00GLX1MG6|4|This was a light comedy that I enjoyed watching on a cold afternoon.  I would highly recommend We're the Millers if you need a good laugh and need light comedy entertainment.
B00PTB7B34|5|this game is awesome if u like strategy games
B00QLVY7J2|2|The level of the playing field here is really a children's level game. This is not a challenging game for me and I am very far from being a pro at games. It is for the skill level of young kids.
0393088774|5|Paul Krugman describes exactly what the United states Government (President, Senate, and House of Representatives) must do to bring us out of this depression.  When citizens are NOT spending money, then the Government must spend money.  Anyone who has studied Economics and is familiar with the writing of John Maynard Keynes knows what works.  The Republican members of Congress appear to want this country to suffer a severe Depression.
B004LWZWGA|5|This Batman to me was the best and I enjoy it so much, I just had to add it to all my movies. 5 star winner in my book of super  guys you got to love. &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; .. the best of the best.
B0089LOG02|5|This is definitely a must read. The parallels of both Vivian's and Molly's stories were just the beginning. What a heartfelt gem!!
B0099RFVXQ|3|Nothing serious or thought provoking here - loud and entertaining.
B0052RDHTM|5|Thrilling saga- cant Wait to read the next one.  Historical fiction at its best - each of the sub stories are equally engaging- great character development
B0027MJU00|5|Although Gone Girl was a good book, Dark Places seems less repetitive and a smoother read. Overall, it is a good book.
B00377E5R2|5|A fun look back. Better than the original with Bogart. Ford is perfect. Bogart was too old for the part.

B0063M22QO|5|Addictive!! 😆
B00DPM7TIG|4|A thourghly engaging novel.  This reader wondered throughout most of the reading as to how or if the French blind girl and the German orphan boy would finally connect.  When they do it is a reasonable, uncontrived event.
B00005ASHM|5|What can i say im in my twentys this is a 1966 Album its spiritual,magical,timeless the greatest Album ever...A complete masterpiece listen to this album feel something you never felt before...
B002ZTQVBQ|5|I had heard this was a great movie to add to my daughters animae collection, but I wasn't all that I love with the story myself.
B002JVWR4U|5|I loved Buffy, so when I found out this was made by the same guy, I knew it would be good too.  And it was! Definitely worth the buy. Awesome show with and interesting plot.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|The Husband's secret had me hooked for the start. Loved each storyline on it's own and even better when they ultimately interconnect. Great beach read, well written, and interesting. I'll definitely be downloading more of Liane Moriarty's books.

B00C7DGQ9C|4|I really enjoyed the movie, pretty good.
B002QE3CTY|5|This series is as good as the Divergent series and also equals Chaos Walking and Hunger Games.<br />Details in writing style and charachter development make this enjoyable to read.
B0083P1QUM|5|Once again, thoroughly enjoyed it.  I've read all Patricia Cornwell's books; she never disappoints!  Can't wait to read another.  Not to mention she makes my mouth water, or should I say Kay Scarpetta does!
B007J4T2G8|4|I chose this rating because I really like the story, though it is a bit thin. Anne Rice is a better erotica writer.
B00FFT1BJ0|5|Great music for all you Hobbits out there! Very relaxing!
B00C7DGQ9C|3|Character background was well established.  The movie was fast paced with plenty of gore. My husband didnt like it while I thought it wasnt a bad movie; hence the three stars.
B006885FZI|5|A MUST SEE, if you have any interest in learning about WW2 in the South Pacific Theatre. Beautifully done. Also watch &#34;Band of Brothers,&#34; if you're interested in WW2 Europe. Amazing story telling, and attention to detail. Highly recommend.

B000GCFX36|5|We all read about the treatment centers that the Super stars go to, like in Malibu! The truth is, most rehab programs are realistic, no glories, no spas, blah food, no super stars!  Poor Rachel kept searching for the luxuries of rehab, however she finally reconnects with reality!  Great read!  I have purchased this book 3 times in hard copy over the last 10 years, loaned them out and never got them returned. Finally downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. Now it's mine forever!
B00E7SXRHY|5|Meant to get the 2013 mix, but was still happy with this. Sounds amazing. Great service, great album. Thanks

B000TXNDUW|5|Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless is considered by film historians to be the beginning of the French New Wave in film, along with Truffaut's The 400 Blows. The film itself is incredible: a dangerous man meeting a beautiful young woman. The box set contains two discs: the film and the supplements, and a booklet featuring the original scenario and a few interesting articles. Overall this is a great film and a great addition to my DVD library. Enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5|All I can say is that I love love this book. It's full of life and love. It's brilliant! It's touching and it brought tears to my eyes.  Not only that, it opened my eyes. Live. Love. Laugh.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Just LOVE IT
B000002U82|5|Every song on this album is fantastic. If you like Pink Floyd your gonna  adore this album.  I personally like the song &quot;Time&quot; the most but  I also like brain damage.  You won't be disapointed with this album, and  with that price I don't think you should pass it up.
B00B8M4IMK|5|Works really well.  Charges quickly.  Just wish it came with the cord, but very happy with it.  I would definitely buy another for my other car.
B000646MNE|5|The package came early, it was nicely packed and I am completely satisfied with my product! Keep up the good service! I would buy from this seller again.
818400060X|4|After Interpreter of Maladies, this is the second Jhumpa Lahiri book that I have picked up. Yes, at the risk of raising eyebrows from one and many, I have to admit that I haven't read The Namesake yet.<br /><br />The first story in the book is `Unaccustomed Earth' and I was lost in this book right from the first page and there's no use in pretending otherwise. The common theme in all these stories is that they narrate about the NRI lives and their everyday nuisance. Be it a mother daughter bonding, or the relationship between a man and his granddaughter or the unwanted helping hand of a well-wishing friend... again it may be about love or friendship or jealousy or abandonment... The stories visit different aspects of relationships and emotions with such a unique perspective that as a reader I questioned myself about a lot of it.<br /><br />Vivid characters live among these pages - characters you will recognize and characters you may even empathize with. They aren't extraordinary in their lives by any means, but it's the author's projection of them that make them seem extraordinary. In any other setting, I would have perhaps called for a bit more strength from some of the characters, but in these cases they were portrayed just right. Each trial and accomplishment of these characters felt like my own trials and accomplishments - such was the power of Ms.Lahiri's prose.<br /><br />I have had a couple of people telling me that they were a bit disappointed that some of the stories turned out to be depressing and so a word of advice for those who are yet to pick this book up (if there's anyone's left at all) -- Please do not expect the stories to be all sunshine and rainbow. The stories are closer to reality than fiction and in real life there's often no happily ever after.
B00MIA0KGY|4|Enjoyed some but not all of the selections but overall, pretty good.
0805047905|5|Young children are very attracted to this book. When I have a selection of books available for my grandchildren, they always look for this one. They have learned colors and animals and how to &quot;read&quot; from memory  from this book.  I would highly recommend it.  Another great book is  &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar.&quot;
B00HGJ18C2|5|I really enjoy this game very much but I am unable tp get into my account
0307720748|3|If you read a lot this book is for you
1938895258|5|The Sequel to Bigger, Leaner, Stronger. If you are a self motivator and are tired of being lied to by the fitness industry then you need to read both books. The truth is achieving the body you want naturally is not as difficult as it may seem. The fitness magazines will not tell you the complete truth of why they look the way they do in those magazines. If you are willing to follow the simple guidelines of fitness described in this book your body will transform and then you will be the person that people look at and ask for weight lifting tips as it has happened to me Since changing my workout regimen described in this awesome book! Enjoy your transformation!!!!
0792845765|5|A great example of how a sequel can taint the film it sequelises, this un-necessary collection combines one of the finest science fiction films of the 1980's with two increasingly bad sequels. 'Robocop' is fantastic - a  satirical view of corruption and crime in a near-future Detroit. The  effects are fantastic, despite the modest budget, and only the OCP  video-wall has dated. Remove the robots and the setting, of a commercial  city on the edge of mania, seems edgily real. The violence is both shocking  and funny, and Verhoven's sardonic black humour was sorely missed from the  sequels.<br />The first sequel, release at the same time as a host of other  sequels ('Die Hard 2' being the obvious competition), was like an  averaged-out, cruder version of the original. The news snippets are more  obviously parodic, the violence is nastier and unfunny, and the whole film  is just a bludgeoning mess. As Empire magazine said, 'if you like to  stagger from a film feeling numb and slightly sick, this is the film for  you'.<br />As for the third, Peter Weller-less film, don't go there. Really.  It's bad. No. Look away. Imagine the disappointment you felt on watching  'Alien 3', magnified a million-fold.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Keeps you wanting more of their romance.... I see a baby in their future... characters keep you captivated with them!
B00A4CHZ2K|5|This a a great album.  I have been waiting for this release since he won American Idol.  Great music, unique sound, awesom lyrics.  The trifecta

B002WV5A9G|5|My wife calls this the &#34;hot spock&#34; movie.  Sorry Leonard, but spock, along with the cast, got an upgrade with this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|This is an easy going novel-no huge drama.  As the story unfolds, the personalities of the characters keep the novel lively.  Mystery begins around the middle of the bood and then interest really perks.  The ending completely surprised me!  Good read.
B007HACDLK|5|I'm a huge Vince Flynn fan, but this is definitely a &#34;can't put down&#34; thriller.  Flynn reintroduces the reader to some old characters and creates new plot twists that will keep the series going long after The Last Man.  I loved it!
B0000047EC|4|I can understand how people can say that this CD is boring. I just don't agree with them. It depends upon what kind of mood you are in. If you are in a danceandrockandroll kind of mood, this ain't gonna cut it. If, on the other hand you are looking for music to listen to while having a quiet romantic at-home dinner (i.e. wine, roses, chocolate mousse and coffee after dinner) this is perfect. It's a great prelude for...a long evening with your significant other. It's the kind of music that is the perfect soundtrack to watching the snowflakes fall (preferably while snuggled in the arms of the above person) or soaking in a hot tub. I listen to it while doing design work as well as it seems to allow the creative juices to flow without distracting me from the work at hand.
B002BX4VEK|5|Bought this for my husband for Valentines Day.  He had been looking for an Elvis CD with &#34;Long Black Limousine on it.  He was so surprised.  My 11 year old is now an Elvis fan!
0307887960|5|I purchased this book because a co-worker strongly recommended it after successfully using this diet plan.<br />Just by reading it I am excited and ready to get going.  I am shopping this weekend to have my food planned out for the week and my daughter and I are beginning it Sunday or Monday and we are both stoked!!<br /><br />You have a 2-7 day jump start phase, then your lose to your goal phase, then the transition back to normal eating phase and finally, the 4th phase is so simple and it helps you keep the weight off the rest of your life.<br /><br />Lose weight and be a healthier you!!  :D
B006LSZECO|5|Really good book would recommend it...it has a lot of twists and keeps you wrapped in the story the whole time
B005LF9AOQ|4|this was a great show start to finish.  I wish I'd seen it when it was on the air.  It's raunchy at times, definitely adult.  But very funny, coherent, and smart.
B0031KC8OC|5|Show is clever and engrossing. Each season has a large mystery and several mini mysteries Veronica solves each week. Mature and explicit at times. Great characters.
B0086700CM|5|very entertaining game! I love how the board changes after every start! its never the same! great for hand eye coordination!
B00FY8ARI8|5|Totally cute amusing movie.  Light hearted, sweet, fun drama.
B006MW3UZW|5|I fought watching this for some unknown reason.  I am addicted!  I love this series!  It's fabulous.  The story lines/acting/sets/costumes . . . all superb.  This is on par with Breaking Bad as far addicting shows goes.
B00785P2QC|4|not bad for a free app. just wish I did not have to buy credits in order yo build stuff faster.
B005K0HDGE|5|I really liked this book. Couldn't put it down at times.  The ending could have happened so may ways and maybe didn't happen the way I wanted it to... this is because I had feelings for the characters and maybe wanted a \\"lived happily ever after\\" type ending.  But that would have been the predictable thing to do and we don't always get our happily ever afters.  Great job making me feel for the characters in such a way.
B007IXWKUK|5|Enjoyed each line - was like a good soap with just enough suspense, drama and of course sex.<br /><br />Purchased this book because I had just finished and enjoyed book one.
B000I9X9HY|3|Good movie
B006P96PAO|5|I loved the movie!  My son (age 15) and daughter (age 10) enjoyed the movie & the meaning behind it.  Thank you!
0345803507|5|I purchased this book for my daughter as a follow up to a previous Fifty Shades book.  She finished it in record time......a bit too racy for me.
0061900656|3|Bought this to help my son learn about becoming a big brother but he is 20 months old and hasn't taken to the book. Who knows why but I'm told this is the best book out there to introduce them to their new baby!
B00001OH80|1|This is generally considered to be one of bowie's worst albums, and for good reasons. That isn't to say there's nothing enjoyable on \\"Tonight\\". There's the fine opener \\"Loving the alien\\", the flawless pop of \\"Blue jean\\", and the rocking (albeit in a 80-ish fashion) \\"Neighborhood threat\\". But the album suffers heavily of a overall lack of inspiration; in production, songwriting, and instrumentation. It almost completely consists of recycled Iggy Pop collaborations(eg.,the earlier mentioned \\"Neighboorhood Threat\\")and covers (eg.,an absolutely horrifying version of \\"God only knows\\"),all done in that typical eighties synth-pop way. But since every album is a document of its time, for a truly comlete reconstruction of Bowie's career even \\"Tonight\\"  is a necessity. Just don't expect to find more  than (very)vague hints of Bowie's genius as a songwriter and singer on this one.
B00127RAJY|4|At first I was skeptical that a home DVD could give me much of a workout, but boy was I wrong. I hadn't worked out for awhile when I started this program. After the first day I'd never been so sore in my life! Anyway, the only criticism I have is that I don't like working out with weights 2 days in a row. I had always been taught that you need to give your muscles at least a day to recover. So I bought the \\"Biggest Loser Cardio Max\\" to alternate and to give me more of a workout variety. So far it's been great. My clothes are fitting better and I just feel a hundred times better.
0765309408|5|I'm a heavy SciFi fan, reading about 1-2 books per week.  After experiencing the plots of Asimov and Heinlein, along with the prose of George R. R. Martin, I've become fairly disillusioned with new offerings.  However, Old Man's War (OMW) is just amazing.  I can't recall the last time I just could NOT put a book down, reading it throughout the entire night.  The characters are emphatic (especially the protagonist), the plot is plausible (especially if you like military novels), and the story is equal parts compelling and heart-breaking (with the descriptions of the protagonist's wife painfully nostalgic).  You simply cannot ask for a better book published in the past five years.  As far as I'm concerned, five stars does this book a disservice.
B008602KQI|5|Don't get me wrong - I quite liked the book The Hunger Games.  It's not the best written book, though - the writing is nothing super spectacular.  It's narrated from Katniss' point of view, and, well, much of the time she sounds like the teenager that she is.  I think the filmmakers put so much TLC into the film because of the widespread popularity of the book, meaning that, if readers who saw the movie were disappointed, the movie would fail to bring in any profits.  The directing, the acting, and the script-writing were really well done.  It was the best translation from book to film that I'd seen in a long time.  I liked it better than the original book, mainly because the WRITING was so much better.  I've watched this movie several times, but I've only read the Hunger Games trilogy once.  Even people who haven't read the book can enjoy the movie and know what's going on, unlike the Harry Potter films (all us HP readers got it, but I have friends who just could not figure out what was going on in one or the other of the HP movies).
0743454537|4|Picoult's novel examines the current debate concerning designer children who have been bred to match critically ill siblings with an eye toward donation.  Initially, Anna is asked to donate tissue that can be regenerated.  Though she must experience painful proceedures to save her sister's life, none will have a detrimentally lasting effect on her future.  However, when she is asked to donate a kidney which means she will be precluded from engaging in her favorite sport and which will have future life consequences on childbearing and other major life events, she resists.  She hires an attorney to seek her medical emancipation. At what point is it too much to ask one child to sacrifice quality of life for the actual life of a sibling?  This is the question presented to the reader.  It is a question of the moment that can be all too real.  Unfortunately, the ending is a cop out so niether the reader nor the author must answer it on these facts.  I really loved this book and would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the ending. It was too neatly tied up with a little bow. Once I started it I could not put it down.  It is a fast and easy read.
B0042TV4IW|5|This series is entertaining, culturally and period interesting as well as clean and family friendly.  Five stars is not enough.
0399165274|5|This is the best Forsyth thriller I've ever read. It gets off to a horrifying start with seemingly random killings of American political figures, adds killings of Brits, and slowly builds to a very satisfying, believable climactic covert operation that kills the convert to radical Islam known as the Preacher, who's modeled on Anwar al-Awlaki, in southern Somalia. I strongly recommend it to any reader who likes the work of Daniel Silva and/or Brad Thor.

B009CPJHY4|4|Loved it. With the cast it can't be anything but terrific.
B003L20ICE|4|I found this movie to be very well-acted and well-directed.  The sexual scenes didn't bother me not one bit, like some of the other reviewers.  I mean, COME ON!!---This is life in the 21st Century!--Grow up already!  People get naked and they interact, okay?---Thank goodness that computers and gadgets   haven't spoiled that for us (yet!), as it has with basic conversational skills and other forms   of by-gone or slowly dying human interaction.     I actually know both a lesbian couple, as well as a gay male couple who  are living similar circumstances as in the premise of this movie.   I found it very modern, refreshing, and mature in it's approach to the subject matter.  I have long been a fan of Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore and Annette Benning's work,  and I also thought \\"the kids\\" themselves did an excellent job at portraying their roles.  My problem was in that I felt like the Mark Ruffalo character kind of had his once happy  and balanced, (for him), life just upheaved and torn apart when he gets contacted by these \\"kids\\",  who of course, have every right to know who their father / donor was, and also what his background is.   Ruffalo's character had a great attitude (I thought) about the whole thing...  He was naturally pensive and cautious at first, though not in a malicious way, but soon warmed to the   idea that he had these \\"kids\\" in his life now, and was more than open to getting to know them, and allow   them to get to know him. I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to just  being an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.  Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.     Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybody   else's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guilty  about all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!  I always say: \\"Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!\\" (-:    Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,   and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, could   only end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,   she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the \\"kids\\",   after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...  As if to say, \\"Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!\\"    This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally left  on the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.  He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,   until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.   Not cool, I felt. )-:  Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own business   and his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' lives   just as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,   and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit   & optimism, being dejected and disregarded. Just my humble opinion of course. (-:    I still enjoyed this movie though, despite its (what I considered to be) plot flaws. **4 Stars**

B000QUCNOK|3|the movie was ok,<br /> I hear that the book was truly great.... maybe I should have just read it...<br />the main charater was interesting to watch, but, I felt, in the end, that there must have been a lot that either didn't make it into the movie or needed to be told not shown.<br />At the end of the day(movie) I didn't think \\"there is two + hours of my life I will never get back\\" but if I hadn't seen it I don't think it would be a great loss to my life either.

1476733953|5|Wool is one of the best books (series) that I have ever read even thought I had to read it in chapters instead of this one edition.<br />You might want to start with Ombudsmen instead of Wool as that made such a difference for me to understand what had happen before Wool, but give it time and you will just love it.  I read these while on medical leave and they made my time incapacitated tolerable.  I found the whole series to be a study of human psychology and endurance.  Would love to ask the author questions about why he thought to do some things and not others.  Would love to see the next stage of this series of stories.  What happens next?????
B00E8JZILA|2|This game is kinda cool but has a lot of cut scenes and different characters than the TV series show

B006MW3V6U|5|This is a great series.  I just love the story line and all of the characters with the mini plots.  It is very well cast.
B000062X9B|5|This cd is dynamic.  As a young person who is a huge Johnny fan, I believe this cd bettered Unchained in a crossover recording that introduces Johnny to an entirely new audience.  He uniquely covers a few popular modern songs while singing a few classic Johnny style songs.  &quot;I see a darkness&quot; brings a tear to my eye every time I sing along with him.  <br />In addition to his own class, other popular artists have the honor of performing with the legend, as well as a great duet with Merle Haggard.  This is a true gem.
B0001AVZA8|5|None of that 'You've got Mail' whimsical crap in this movie, thanks goodness! <br />Keaton's a bit too high strung, though I definitely hope to look as sexy (and lovable and cute) as her in my fifties! Boy can she cry!!! Nicholson somehow manages to find such a way with words that he transcends the script to another amazing level. What a talent! Frances McDormand was underused but the movie was long enough as it is and her big scene was stellar.<br />I'm 21 and I've watched this movie 4 times in the cinema. Not because I'm bored but because I felt that tug at my heartstrings everytime I watched the relationship develop between the two leads. It's delightfully complex, as it should be, and I could identify with the rawness of opening up to another person, so this flic isn't just for the baby boomers.<br />When was the last time I watched a movie 4 times? ...in another planet probabaly. When was the last time I watched a movie more than once? That was so long ago I can't remember the title of the movie.<br />It's not surprising that I still love listening to the soundtrack...though Jack N. crooning La Vie En Rose wasn't the best addition to a great compilation.<br />I don't know how Nancy Meyers can top this movie in her next effort, by boy do I sure hope she manages somehow. She has just raised the bar for romantic comedies...no more sitting through flaky movies of this genre, I'll just pop home to watch SGG on DVD, when it's released...in the meantime, the movie's still enjoying a wonderfully long screening here in Melbourne!
B00632HWOG|5|Love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|I would give this book five stars, but the reason it gets four is due to slowness of the middle. By the end it was certainly worth the time! I must say that I did predict the ending. If you love racially themed books which take place in the South and where justice prevails, this is a MUST read!
B00B0LPWU6|4|Very good drama, Denzel is the BEST!!!<br /><br />Flight scenes are outstanding with great performances by Bruce Greenwood and John Goodman as well.
B0091REZMW|5|Great game for free great time killer good graphics and easy to follow along i would recommend to others that like hidden object games
B00E8KLWB4|5|This game is awesome, but I hate waiting for more energy!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Excellent story loved it from beginning to end. Well written, tremendous effort used to develop these complicated characters and wonderfully imaginative plots. Truly enjoyed it.
B008K8U13K|5|It's so good I play it every day.you should get it.
B00003CXCT|4|I love starwars. I was at just the right age when it came out, to be totally blown away by the effects, storyline and the whole experience. I had the original release on VHS, and later got the digital enhanced version on VHS. Now - this set gives me a more permanent copy of the 3 movies, plus a whole DVD of background and an hour long show putting the whole phenomena in historical context. That's most likely my favorite part - as it more than anything else, takes me back to my childhood.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars then? Well - because this is the \\"new\\" version of Starwars - not the old and original one. I know George Lucas didn't like the original version completely - but that's the version I fell inlove with. When the original digitized version was first done, I remember the documentaries showing the difference. What's left is scenes with too much digitization - it takes away from the story, and looks like it's just there to show off.<br /><br />I would have apprechiated a documentary about the digitization too (at the very least) and the option of playing the original version without the addons.<br /><br />As you've noticed - I'm not describing the movies themselves. They are self-evident the best story ever told on the big silver screen. No doubt. It wasn't the technology or the special effects alone. It was the full and complete combination of a great story told perfectly. Of course it looks a bit crude with todays eyes - but that just makes it even more important and more interesting to learn about. And to keep for future references.<br /><br />The Trilogy is a documentary of a milestone in moviemaking. Any sci-fy buff out there (like me) should definately own this. And for that matter, so should everyone else. May the force be with you ....
B000002JS0|5|I am a fan of the Bon Scott ara,and to me , this is a good Bon album.My favorite song in ITS A LONG WAY TO THE TOP because Bon plays a part along with Angus,on get ready for this, the bagpipes.The pipes sound suprisingly good playing with the guitars.This album also features one of my favourite songs,THE JACK.The rest of the album is also good,featuring songs like HIGH VOLTAGE,T.N.T,and LIVE WIRE.A good rock album!!
B009SJ3H8Q|4|truly horrifing
B00DJFIMW6|3|I really liked the older version better. Sure there's a lot more stuff, but it makes it less fun. The jelly lab is slow loading up and the fact that you can't change the place you're in in the middle of your run is so annoying. Purple minion doesn't last nearly long enough and it doesn't load the body of the minion. Just the mouth eyes arms and hair. Basically the only thing they did to make it better was holding contests. If they had just added that I would have been very pleased. But this is way too much.
B00F1BFRA6|5|Given as gift.  Recipient was very pleased!
B000BTC5LW|5|Yeah think they have the release date wrong - the same disc on the UK Amazon site has a release date of January 17 2006. <br /> <br />Brilliant DVD of a jaw-dropping concert. I was lucky enough to be at Earl's Court in London on the night they shot this video. Never seen anything like it before or since - the special effects were just out of this world, as was the music. We were treated to Dark Side all the way through without a break. Ended with Comfortably Numb with the huge glitter ball lowered down from the roof before it opened up in a hail of lasers and dry ice and Run Like Hell where they threw everything they had at it for a spectacular finale. An unbelievable experience and one that has taken far too long to make it to DVD! Very excited to put this through it's paces on a decent system and TV!
B000001E3V|5|Anyone who picked up a guitar would love this album.I have all Eric's albums. This is the jem of them all.For twice the enjoyment ,Turn up the volume twice as much.No record collection is complete without it.!!
B006LR0XLM|5|easy to set up and got lots of extra free storage by adding computers and devices. been recommending dropbox to clients and friends
B0069G5Z9K|5|I am I love with this games. I can't stop playing.I am always trying to bet the tasks.  if you want a game to keep you busy. THIS IS THE GAME
0316204366|5|At the start of a new year Malcolm presented me with another way of seeing the world and the events that is happening to us.  It is interesting that another way of looking at things bring about a big change in the viewer, if not the situation.  When we see things differently, we act differently.  That change makes all the different.
B008Y2FRFO|1|Meh
B00457WZEI|4|War Horse was written from the horse's point of view as he grew up on a farm, then was sold to the military and put into service in Europe during The Great War--World War I. It is also the love story of a boy and his horse, the betrayal that caused the two to be separated and the long journey toward their reunion. I think this would be a great book to read to a child.
B002N8A14M|4|It's a simple little device but it certainly keeps my IPod in place at the gym.  I put it on and forget it's there.  It's comfortable yet efficient.
B001L5YW9I|5|This is one of those movies I could watch over and over and experience new things and nuances to the storyline. Always anticipating those scenes when love surpasses mere words and with a thought, a look, it speaks volumes.
B0001AP12G|5|If you really want to listen a rap cd that doesn't sputter redundant crap like having the best cars and the most women, listen to this Kanye West.  The biggest problem with rap/hip hop music is that for the last 10 f**king years the music is devining the musicians instead the other way around.  No offense to jay-z, but west is probably the most talented rapper on the roc.  Kanye west doesn't have the strength to revolutionize the game yet, but this is a nice start to build it up.  In his song &quot;We don't care&quot; he offers a explanation in a simplistic way of how his people act.  The entire song is a humourous, showing one of many west's talents on this cd.  In the song &quot;all falls down&quot; he talks about being subconscious and effects of materialism on society, especially the african american woman.  He basically asks why are we so addicted to what other people think?  I would compare kanye west's philosphical approach to outkast's creativity.....the best in game.  buy this cd, it's worth 15 bucks.
B002LB13SE|3|Another scary movie.  I like the remake better than the original
B00005GA13|5|STUNNING! This SACD is one of the finest I have heard. The mix is perfect. The dynamics are good. An excellent engineered piece of art. Good luckfinding the SACD version, buy it. I payed 28 dollars, i would pay twice as much, after listening to it. I love it in every sense. More, more, more!
B0029VT3UQ|4|This film kept my attention, was fast paced and had a sad ending.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to understand another side of human nature.
B0095ZQ36G|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this true story of a German fighter pilot who spared the lives of a B-17 crew. The book delves into the lives of the two pilots, with more detail on Stiger the German. Interesting biography of both men and how they initially met and how they met again many years later.
B00000DR8R|5|I can't believe no-one's posted a review here on this excellent album. Listen to it to evoke images of dark clubs and red wine and slow dancing with your honey... this is one of my all-time favorites.
B00BUKZ4HI|5|Great deal on Despicable Me blu-ray combo...my Grandson loves this movie and so do we. Great family movie for everyone.
B001H5X7I4|1|Words fail to describe how bad this movie is. Not only is it a bad movie, but done in the poorest of taste. I don't have a problem with pushing the envelope, but this film goes way beyond that premise. This is the prime reason that I do not trust reviews or the actors who choose their roles. This movie is trash and the actors, producers or director should re examine their goals regarding the work they do.
B003OML23K|5|You would expect this book to be a \\"heartwarmer\\" but I loved the honest insights into the dynamics of a modern family. Yes there is humor and unabashed parental pride, but these are tempered by very real issues and fears and that made for good story telling and a very satisfying read. This would be an excellent nonfiction choice for book club discussion.
0316098329|4|With all of the medias attention on the REAL LIFE capitivity of JayCee Dugard, this fictional book was difficult to put down. The story is told through the eyes of 5 year old Jack who lives his entire life in a ROOM. I would love for this book to made into a movie. Very well written!
B00005JLF5|5|I was a fan of TNG during it's original run and when DS9 debuted I gave it a shot and hated it. Recently I finally bought the entire TNG series and realized what I appreciate in the writing of the show had changed dramatically in 20 years. I was famished for more Star Trek so figured I'd try DS9 and found again my tastes had changed and I loved it. Great cast, amazing writing and the Ferengi didn't bother me nearly as much as I had expected. In particular I thought the episode \\"Duet\\" was phenomenal, it reminded me of my favorite TNG episode \\"Measure of a Man\\".<br />My only complaint is the special features. I was going to watch them before moving onto season 2 but after the second major spoiler I popped out the disc and will just move onto the next episode. So if yr like me and enjoying this series for the first time come back to the special features after season 7 unless you don't like surprises.

0385342047|3|Sophie Kinsella has written six books in her Shopaholic Series. The first three books were cute and endearing. Becky's various dramas and inability to save money were amusing. Her skill at finding a way to fix everything at the last minute had you rooting for her throughout the story. I found these books to be quite enjoyable.    The last two books in the series were a different story. Becky showed little growth as a character. Her antics-which started off as funny-became repetitive. When I'm reading a story, I hope to see the main character grow and change; something Becky seems unable to do. Her lack of growth led to books that felt repetitive and formulaic.    This disappointing pattern is not broken in Mini Shopaholic. The only difference in Becky's latest adventure is the addition of a two-year-old accomplice. Becky is now able to excuse her shopping habits by passing them off as her daughter's. This small addition is not enough to make the plot interesting. I struggled to get through the first half of the book. I kept hoping that the \\"How does Becky get herself out of trouble this time\\" storyline was enough to continue reading. Luckily it was worth the wait.    The first half of this book was mostly a tale of self-indulgence and reckless behavior. By contrast, the second half was interesting and moving. I enjoyed how the relationship between Luke and his estranged mother was explored. This story grabbed my attention and made me want to keep reading. The storyline did not entirely save the book, but made me glad I stuck with it.    As always, the book ended as a setup for another addition in the Shopaholic series. I would be interested in reading this next book to see what is in store for Luke and his mother. Unfortunately I feel this followup story will again focus primarily on Becky and her flighty tendencies. I would have hoped by now that she had learned something, but clearly not. Perhaps the next tale will be the one in which we finally see Becky grow asa character.    Review: I feel as if this book would be more enjoyable to someone unfamiliar with the series. As a standalone story, the plot is interesting. As part of a series, it feels recycled. There are only so many times I can read about Becky's repeated mistakes before I start wondering why she has yet to learn anything. For fans of the series, I suggest this as a library read. It is OK but not worth the $13.50 purchase price.
B00MELK918|5|I was sad to get to the end. Griping story. Now I have to wait another year. I wish Archer wrote faster.
B00MEOD4KI|4|I've been a fan of the Ninja Turtles ever since the 1987 Ninja Turtles cartoon came out. Then I saw the live action version of the movie in 1990 and I was disappointed that it didn't feature the turtle van, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady, however I liked the movie which still holds up to this day. Fast forward to 2014 and you get a Ninja Turtles movie that's a lot closer to the 1987 cartoon, however the only thing missing from this movie is Bebop, Rocksteady and Krang. The turtle van made an appearance towards the very end of the film, which is awesome. They also had Vern from the 1987 cartoon played by Will Arnett, which is awesome because I liked him in Arrested Development. They also casted the hottest April O'Neil ever...Megan Fox.<br /><br />Now what are my gripes about this movie? They made Shredder look like the Silver Samurai and Iron Man combined. There is no mention of Hamato Yoshi. The Turtles look like they're on steroids. The turtles also look a little too weird. They should have stayed with the original design, but just change things a little with their attire. Also CGI doesn't look as good as animatronics/rubber suits, which is what was so appealing about the original Ninja Turtles. Also Donatello does not need to wear stereotypical glasses.<br /><br />So I give this film a 4 out of 5, it could have been better if they fixed certain problems here and there. But it's at least better than Transformers.
B00JFKEQBK|1|Could be awesome, but Amazon's always-on DRM prevented me from playing in the subway.
B008A1B5Z0|1|I noticed no difference at all using this app.  The built-in memory management on the phone works just fine.  All this does is take up unnecessary storage with no benefit to performance.  Uninstall.
B00AATV046|5|One of my favorites.
B00CCEHR80|5|This was a show an old friend who has passed talked about as &#34;the best JGB show of all time&#34; and I have to say after all these years of expectations it fully exceeded mine. No collection should be without this or the others in this JGB collection.
B00S1M7KXO|5|Another great album in his evolution away from Dire Straits to what he wants to now say at this stage
B00DBSZEH2|4|Follows in the footsteps of movies like Van Helsing and Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter. Full of non stop action and a little gore!
B00BVYNSLC|5|Awesome series glad it's getting more attention now
B0048KXRR6|3|The original Nanny McPhee had a stronger script and stronger characters, less dependent upon high-tech gimmicks and more on character development within the children (Simon, in particular).  Also, here, Nanny McPhee is far less a presence--more a chauffeur and less a teacher/mentor.
B006LQQ1GE|5|Just listen, you'll be convinced, his music is magical. Oh, and great price, quick shipped. Will never be the same after this music.

B008XG1X18|5|love it, its there whenever you have a moment and wont unfriend you when your not! need I say more......
B00D97HPQI|3|After reading great futurist books like [[ASIN:0715635611 The Singularity is Near]], [[ASIN:1451695764 Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think]] and [[ASIN:1494712113 The Human Race to the Future: What Could Happen - and What to Do]] I was expecting another eye-opening book on the technologies that will transform society in the coming decades. Instead, the book is merely a summary of a few selected technologies already mentioned in Abundance (like IBM's Watson supercomputer) or that anybody following tech news regularly would have read about countless times, like self-driving cars.<br /><br />I was hoping for a book that explains more precisely how artificial intelligence, automations and robots will replace people in most jobs, and an in-depth analysis of what jobs will disappear soon and which ones will remain safe for the foreseeable future. I was looking forward to read about how the peer economy, 3-D printers and personal domestic robots will completely change the way we produce and consume. Unfortunately the book does not address any of these. The authors just explain, repetitively and in plain language, that machines will make consumer products cheaper while taking away people's jobs. But who doesn't already know that when it's been discussed countless times in the news?<br /><br />Chapters 13 and 14 (one fifth of the book) are policy recommendations on how to make the USA more like northern Europe, by raising the standards of education, decreasing socio-economic inequalities, improving the infrastructure, taxing pollution, taxing more the rich and less the poor, or using a value added tax (VAT) system. I don't know if Erik Brynjolfsson was feeling nostalgic about his ancestral Scandinavia when he wrote that, but that is hardly relevant to the Second Machine Age. Even though the USA could benefit from that, Scandinavians will not be immune to the rise of automations regardless of how advanced they are in these regards.<br /><br />As a side note, on page 241, it says that the United States is the only one of 34 OECD countries not to have a VAT. That is not true. Japan used to have VAT, but it scrapped it for a consumption tax in 1989. A Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management ought to know that. Besides, the state of Michigan does use VAT (known as &#34;Single Business Tax&#34; or SBT).
076781214X|5|Peggy Sue got Married is a great film. It touches us all, because everyone has a memory of what their life was when they were kids that is (usually unrealistically) pleasant. We tend to toss out the bad memories and hold on  to those that were good ones, or we embellish them with our fantasy of the  way it should have been. It is kind of like going to heaven and being able  to live our life over again the way we would have liked to in the first  place. This is the feeling I got from the movie. &quot;Browsing the past  and taking with us only the best parts&quot; (or something like that) as  Peggy's grandmother said to her. It is a fantasy that would be very  wonderful when we do die. Maybe God will give us a chance to live in a  world that exhilirates us rather than the sometimes unpleasant one we have  to live with.
B004Z2TUGE|5|This movie is part of a series of which  I've seen the majority and they're all good to me. In other words they're movies I'd watch again therefore the 5 star rating. I recommend this movie to scifi buffs and action lovers because they'll get both!
B00005OM4N|5|I am a Britney fan and I am proud of it. For all those people out there who hasn't bought this cd and said its horrible, you are wrong. I have all 3 cds and this is the best. She has grown up and if you are to ignorant to read what I have to say, you shouldn't be looking Britney's new cd. Here is what I think of each song:<BR>1. I'm a Slave 4 You ~ A+ I like this song. It doesn't me anytihng bad at all. Its saying she's growing up and people can't see that... <BR>2. Overprotected ~ A this is song is pretty cool. Its about her once again.<BR>3. Lonely ~ A+ this is one of my favorites<BR>4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ~ A this is probably the song that relates to her the most and one of almost every fan's favorite. am i rite?<BR>5. Boys ~ B- I dont really like this song, though i like the beat.<BR>6. Anticipating ~ A this song seriously sounds like its from Janet Jackson. Sounds pretty good.<BR>7. I Love Rock N' Roll ~ B- I used to likehis song because I heard the original, this version is bad cause she made it more modern.<BR>8. Cinderella ~ A++++++++ this is my number one, all time favorite song of this album. It shows girl power, attitude, and that Britney got a great voice.<BR>9. Let Me Be ~ A+ another good song<BR>10. Bombastic Love ~ A- sounds a bit weird this song.<BR>11. That's Where You'll Take Me ~ A if you have a stressful day, its good to listen to this song. Very soothing<BR>12. What Its Like To Be Me ~ A+++++++++ second favorite song. yes even though Justin wrote this song its good(cause I hate NSYNC).<br />If you don't believe me, buy it yourself.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love it! so addicting. keeps you entertained and your mind sharp. if only you didn't have time outs. But I give it the five star rating.
B00004YRQA|5|Works fine, without issue. Mine did come with several Medal of Honor and Grand Theft Auto saves on it, but I have no complaints.
B0017I1IZA|5|I laughed out loud multiple times. I love the comedy and the romance. Two thumbs up!!! Can't wait to finish the series
B000W04S6U|5|I love the soundtrack! This is easily the best Halo soundtrack yet. Thanks Marty!! (+ Michael!)

B00009V7RF|4|man is that first guy an idiot - and YES 'lets get retarded' IS obviously justified as offensive to disabled people! But obviously you keep an open mind about these things, as you seem to suffer from sort of mental disadvantage, and manage not to take ofense to the track name aswell!<BR>Albums pretty funky fresh too :p
B009ZQC7MY|5|I love this series its so good ...cant wait for more to come out ....loved it awesome and really good

B00PSID6ZK|5|I think it's really,really good for kids and I just think it's great to play even me I love this game it's easy and simple you don't even need instructions it's simple even my<br />2year old cousin figured it out right away
B00LDNE3FG|4|I love this game great theme great animation awesome
B0018CENUC|5|If you like Toby Keith then this is something you really want. It's a very good cross section of his best stuff. He's got a lot of great stuff! I'm a classic rock person myself but TK and Hank Williams Jr always have a place in my music collection. This was a perfect TK purchase for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|First time reading this authors work and u really enjoyed it. My sister in law is reading it now and she loves it too!!

B00B8WXFWE|5|Great selection of new music by my favorite guys from Boston! Loved it as expected! Great mix of music as usual!
B009UX2YAC|5|Great game  to play. Keeps the kids entertained for hours. Like all the customizable options in the game. I like it too.
B004I4H8QS|2|Disappointed..no good songs except Layla. It was my fault. I was expecting long version of the song. Instead, mixture of the group.
B003Q5CO6Y|5|This episode went very differently from what I imagined.  I am delighted to say it was handled so much more masterfully than I could have ever imagined.  It was perfect.  I don't want to give the surprise away here so all I'll say that is that enforcer we've seen used throughout (the bald guy other than Walt) comes to see Walt.  He tells him a story about when he was a cop and used a half measure and someone ended up getting killed.  He concludes the story by saying that was the end of his not handling a problem the whole way and seeing it through.  He has come to tell Walter this story because he sees Jesse as a huge problem which needs to be resolved in no half way measures. Walter takes this advice and there flows the whole rest of the episode.  Just terrific stuff.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I am late to the Downton Abbey craze, I started watching half-way through Season 4. I was hooked and had to catch up on the first 3 seasons. Hope there will be many more seasons of this series to come.
B000OZ0NXA|3|The Kindle Fire version of this book includes a rather lengthy explanation about the Jack Reacher genesis from the author.  A foreigner writing a first person book about an American is a tough task to begin with, but when you add a clear lack of knowledge of firearms and tactics, it's almost painful.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this is a great thriller.  The story is plausible and fun to follow along with, but the glaring technical errors are almost unrecoverable.  Most distracting is Mr. Child's confusion with regard to the differences between automatic and semi-automatic weapons.  In his books, Mr. Child seems to think that any weapon not classified as a revolver is therefore an automatic.<br /><br />This mistake is made over and over (including in the excerpt from the second Jack Reacher book).  There are also some blatant inaccuracies with the ballistics of shotguns (and their dispersion patterns).  This lack of knowledge extends to hand to hand combat scenes.<br /><br />If you're looking for accuracy, or you're a gun enthusiast, this isn't your series.  This is more of a popcorn thriller than actual substance (Like Brad Thor's Scot Harvath series, for example).  Can't expect too much from a British sitcom writer.  At least it's entertaining.
B0045XKJBI|5|I know this is a teenagers show, but if you like the supernatural and Grimm and shows like that it is very similar just with younger actors.
B00DJFIMW6|2|So, when I first downloaded the game it was amazing. Everything was working perfect. However it started to take longer and  longer to get past the minion download page to get to the play screen. Since the update I've only been able to play it once. Not too happy, this was my favorite game on my Kindle. I try everyday and it still has not worked, even after downloading multiple times. Boo! So not happy! Please fix!!!!!

B00D7Z4GQY|3|I just finished this book about 10 minutes ago and I am a little upset about how it ended. I don't want to spoil it so I will just say that it wasn't very good. My three stars are because it kept me entertained and ready for more. I liked each character which is why I am upset on how it ended.
B007J4T2G8|5|Great this book is a page turner  a bit unexcepting  of the fifty shades and how the girl was trying to work this out as he was her first
B00R5DXFS4|5|Going down as one of my all time top fav soundtracks!! A++
B000JMKTLO|4|It's ok
B00IUBXPEY|5|good movie
B00AIUUXHC|5|I absolutely love this game. I have gotten to the Megalodon Shark. The new update was very cool. I like that they added in a portal to the Arctic Region. Can't wait to get the Big Daddy and whatever comes after that. This a great game. It's fun to play. I have had progress reset on a lot of games and it's nothing to be upset about. Very fun. Everybody should play it. Hint: upgrade your sharks bite, boost and speed to help it grow. If you want more coins buy the items that give you a coin boost.
1452110581|5|My daughter says they read my diary! I think they did! Funny, funny book. I could pee on this, and other poems by cats.
0143039431|5|It wasn't that this had some exciting story that kept the reader glued to the pages.  No shocking climax (although there are a number of shocking events portrayed throughout), no personified villian... none of that.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is phenomenal not for the unforgetable cross-country trek of the Joad family in the post-depression years, but for the essence of humanity which Steinbeck so perfectly captures in every chapter.  Steinbeck demonstrates how people who are just barely getting by on what they have sometimes have more to give to their fellow man than the wealthiest citizens our society has to offer.  He draws a vivid picture of struggle during hard times for the most disenfanchized Americans, yet shows the emotional side of poverty and disolutionment, and reveals how genuin humanity can often be most prevalent amidst the most inhumane of living conditions.<br /><br />It has been said that Steinbeck had a socialist agenda when he came out with The Grapes of Wrath, but I couldn't disagree more with that assessment.  Steinbeck isn't so much jabbing at a political/economic injustice in this novel as he is striking at the lack of humanity that can be brought about when business efficiency and profitability are thought to trump human decency.<br /><br />As I write this review the American financial system is once again in peril, and themes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are suddenly becoming more meaningful than they had been when I read this book in high school.  I am amazed at how true and applicable Steinbecks points still ring today, and I recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it in years or who has yet to read it for the first time.
B00FGFVMGA|4|This game reminds me of the Sierra adventure games from 20+ years ago. It has great visuals and artwork, but the difficulty results in a gave that didn't take me long to complete.<br />Regardless, for what it is, I enjoyed playing it and I the most of you will too.
B00VFTCGES|4|A decent Sci Fi flick.  A bit heavy on the feels and a bit light on the science part.  Probably the most annoying thing was understanding  McConaughey's dialog, as he mumbles through many of his lines.  It was worth the viewing, but it won't be making the AFI top 100 list.
B00BAXFECK|5|Attention capturing from beginning!
B007HC3LHS|5|This was a great book.  It held my interest throughout the whole book.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I usually read before I go to sleep and I couldn't wait for to read each night.
B00LSWU1A8|5|Great CD !
B0000004F9|5|A line up of remarkable people create remarkable music. The Canterbury scene at its finest. Early 'Softs and Floyd define what was to come in great British music.
B000J103PC|3|From what I can remember when I read the book, the film stayed fairly true to the book...which is very unusual.  If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />It's the story of a young girl who moves to NYC to become a journalist but finds herself working as an assistant for a top notch fashion magazine, which is way out of her style league. The girl is a go-getter so she does what she has to do to make it work and ends up becoming the right hand (wo)man to the editor and chief changing her life (for better or worse) forever.<br /><br />The movie, even though trashed by some critics as \\"shallow and unfulfilling\\", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, \\"Runway\\", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.<br /><br />All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the \\"high-class\\" laughs that it packs.
B00CWY76CC|4|Overall this game was very entertaining. A few of the tasks seemed a little silly but in the end it did a decent job of keeping me occupied.
B000002HPV|5|I always forget which songs are on this album exactly. When I listen again, I realize that almost all of my favorites are on here. So great, start to finish.
B004DLPXAO|5|I actually bought my daughter a Kindle & we loved it. Then I got a new phone & it had a Kindle app! I used it every single day. When I got a new phone that didn't have the Kindle app I was so upset.....until my daughter told me to go on Amazon & download it---Perfect!!! It's so convenient & easy to use. There is a huge selection of books to choose from: every genre & price range! Can't live w' out it :)
B00A7OJ0DC|5|Love the movie and 3D effects were great.  Is a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again.
B00006ADD5|5|Of all the movies that really don't need another review, this one probably heads the list. However since 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of my all-time top ten films I wanted to add my two cents anyway.<br /><br />Seldom in cinematic history has there ever been so grand a tale told as the story of T. E. Lawrence and his miraculous accomplishments in the deserts of Arabia. A man of truly mythic proportions whose interior vision was so powerful it forever changed the course of world politics. By an act of pure, concentrated willpower (\\"Nothing is written unless I write it\\") Lawrence defied all the odds and experts, uniting the ever-feuding semitic tribes of the Middle East under one flag in a battle for Arab independence. This was a daring project to commit to film and it paid of, becoming one of the most honored and studied films of all-time.<br /><br />Columbia pulled out all the stops in bringing this true life adventure to the screen. Nothing but the best was required. Director David Lean, complimented by one of the most skilled casts ever assembled; Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer brought the story to life as nobody else could. Coupled with Maurice Jarre's epic soundtrack, we have been graced with as perfect a film as you will ever see.
B0057A6GA6|5|This is the best one yet. Its got a ton of levels and is a solid challenge. Completely worth the $3.
160774418X|5|Great food, and straightforward recipes<br />This book is visually stunning and filled with wonderfully tasty recipes.<br />Think this is the favorite of the three cookbooks I have of his.<br />Recipes are easy to prepare, instructions good and concise.<br />Pictures are beautiful and I think enjoyable for those who might not make everything from the book.<br />The pictures also let you know that you don't have to prepare fussy food to eat well and have a treat for the eyes as well as your taste buds, great food simply done
B00OTLFGDW|5|Awesome product and wonderful customer service
B001NLL93W|5|more than worth the read. cation packed, keeps you wanting more and to move on to the next book. awesome
B003Q6D2B4|5|Thought provoking motion picture.
B003O86FMW|5|I gave this book a five star rating because, of how Suzanne Collins wrote the book. To me it gives you a mind movie of what it would look like in Katniss`s shoes. She is a very good writer I look forward to the third book!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excellent product
B00486070K|4|A simple plug-and-play adapter that works like a charm.  Wish it were a little cheaper, but not having to deal with downloading and installing of drivers needed for non-native product may just well be worth the premium.
B002MQYOFW|5|If a book captures my daughter's attention and she can't stop talking about it - I'll give it a try as well.<br />However, previous bestsellers such as the Twilight serious and even the last couple of Harry Potter books have been more than disappointing for me.<br />The Hunger Games was intriguing and interesting to read. Placed in a unusual setting but not completely futuristic either. Best of all - it is written really well. I loved it!
B003XF1XOQ|5|I bought these in hard back when they first came out... I bought them again for my Kindle Fire! Great books!
0783228317|5|This film is one of the most outstanding masterpieces of the modern-day motion picture era. Hunter S. Thompson describes every aspect of the characters lives in a very distraut manner that makes complete sence,if you  think about it. This is one of the few movies that requires the thought of  its viewers to get everything out of it. No special effects, and no movie  magic. Just a twisted way to see the world, and a helluva good movie.
B000UZPIAW|5|Awesome book by and awesome guy. for all of us &#34;Headbangers&#34; form the late 70's, early 80's you will appreciate the honesty of Nikki Sixx. The book is well written and it really a page turner leaving you for more one it is done. A definite to read for families of Heroin addicts, it wil let you inside of the mind of your loved one and hope at the same time!!!
B00004BZ16|4|Sandinista is so much more than the sum of it's parts. I won't even try to classify it because to do so would be impossible. The Magnificent Four tackle every imaginable genre and then some on what was originally a 3 record set - a subversive act in and of itself. What on earth were they thinking? Did they have any idea how appropriately this album would convey the spirit of 1980 (or anticipate what was ahead musically)? This album is Rock and Roll in every sense of the term; raw, loud, spontaneous, fun, serious, dark, hopeful, untidy and relevant.<br /><br />One recommendation though - find a decent vinyl copy and listen to all six sides of the actual record - loudly.
B00QW4QWYQ|5|I didn't think Steven Wilson would ever be able to improve on The Raven that Refused to Sing; that album was soooooo good. I think I was wrong. For sure, this album is different. (Being unpredictable is about the only thing about Wilson that's somewhat predictable.) I was slightly surprised the first time I heard &#34;Perfect Life&#34;, but I grew to love it. The weakest track is probably the title track, which is a little pop-oriented, but even that track isn't bad and several of the longer tracks are masterpieces. This is easily the best album I've heard so far in 2015.  I don't think there's any other artist in this genre that comes close right now.
B005ZOBNOI|5|'Felt' the love between these kids! So brave and so smart <br />Literally could not put this book down!<br />Everyone should read!
B00NOPQU2K|3|A good read.
B00GX59QO2|5|I really like Bruce Willis as an actor and try to see everything he is in. This movie, and Red, the previous one, have a great combination of humor and action. The supporting characters in both of these moves are awesome.
B000002TQV|5|What can you say about &quot;The Bends&quot; that isn't already said below?  One of my favorites and truly inspiring.  Just the fact that it is and was such a huge comeback album for Radiohead after everyone in the  media dismissed them as a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;.  When I look back at  this decade and think about all the great albums that came out, and also  the lack of great albums, I put this one up with the best of them...   1.   Pavement  - Slanted and Enchanted 2.  Guided By Voices  - Bee Thousand<br />3.   Liz Phair  - Exile in Guyville 4.  My Bloody Valentine  - Loveless 5.   Built To Spill  - There's Nothing Wrong With.. 6.  Nirvana  - Nevermind 7.   Radiohead  - The Bends 8.  Beck  - Odelay 9.  Pixies  - Trompe Le Monde 10.  Sebadoh  - Sebadoh III
B008Y7J91M|5|Great show, one of my favorites!
B00821OX98|5|great story, has me binge watching the whole season!
B006YGC7KK|5|This is one of the best shows on tv. Since my local CW station is not hi def ,I prefer to watch on Blu-ray.
B00AREIAI8|5|So much fun to play I would say that lots of people would enjoy this app especially if you like horses
B00G6ZTM3Y|4|Cool game
B00H3GZMIE|5|I love the CD but I wish it had the radio, dance version of the song &#34;Latch&#34;.  The one on this CD is the slower, acoustic, version.  Still, I can't stop playing this CD.  His voice is like butter!
B002OMZTSK|5|I saw the movie first and then saw that it was based on a book so I quickly bought it and after I read it I was fairly disappointed in the movie for switching it up so much. I hope they turn this series into movies!
039916927X|5|This book is perfect for any girl in Highschool or college or anywoman any age looking for some direction. I loved every bit of it and am now passing it on to my daughter to read it!
B005LAIH4A|5|Bought for my grandson and he really enjoyed the movie.
B007SGLZP8|4|As usual Grisham keeps my interest, but this one teaches about the FBI and federal prison system and had a strong finish.
0755111974|5|Gerald Durrell was not only a naturalist and a gifted writer about his beloved animals, but a loving brother and son whose descriptions of his family and their foibles will keep you laughing all the way through. This is one of those books which I've reread so many times I've lost count, and which I've given to many friends who needed cheering up. Always works, too!
B00J2PEZAU|2|Tried two nights to watch and was bored to the point of falling asleep. Couldn't wait for the movie to end
0679722610|4|Heavy on action with a decent plot, I liked this book in spite of it being a little bloody for my taste (though not surprisingly so) and a lot of its many characters remaining relatively undeveloped. The sleuth is no Philip Marlowe, but he's a solid lead, crafty and competent. Fun read.
B00D3PYQT0|5|What can I say? I love, love, love the series, so of course I love, love, love the DVDs. Can hardly wait for Season 5! Very good series that keeps you wanting more.
B007FEFLTO|4|The Century trilogy is amazing. Until now the century was described traveling trough the first and second world wars. Loved the too first books. Let's see the last one
B0090EHVMC|1|DO NOT download this from Amazon. Go buy or rent it from somewhere. It has been playing for less than 40 minutes & has stopped at least 10 times! Ridiculous!!
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is fun and AWESOME!!! I highly recommend this game for kids 7-100. I love it
B00DR0PDNE|1|For me, it's been a piece of crap. Very unstable. I have several laptops, desktops, Roku, and even DVD wi-fi players, and none of them, except this Chromcast device, have trouble connecting up. And it is every time I use it. I have to reboot several times, cross my fingers, and toss coins into the fountain to get it to sync up with my laptop to stream. It is much easier to just use my 25 foot HDMI cable from my laptop to the TV, and be done with it. A waste of money...
B003ICWTTM|5|I had the opportunity to experience Bruce and the E Street Band in concert last fall and waited with anticipation for the release of this DVD \\"London Calling\\".  The \\"Boss\\" and the \\"Band\\" did not disappoint me. Bruce was Bruce at his best and each member of the E Street Band sparkled and shined.  With the Blue-Ray technology you are drawn into the concert and is so clear that you can read the writing on Big Man's saxophone.  I am so excited that I can now have a Springsteen concert at home anytime.  This DVD is a must for any Springsteen and E Street Band fan but a warning once you have seen it you will want to view it over and over.
B000O14VAU|4|\\"Underworld\\" is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time. While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of \\"Death Dealers\\" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.<br /><br />The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks). The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used. The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie! Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0345350499|5|This is one book that I have found myself not wanting to put it down. My daughter has read it and even now on my second time reading I still hate to put it down even for a break.
0061950726|5|Everyone I passed it onto were enlightened to this part of American History.Most of us weren't aware of this happening. Then we read the Longest Road and were again finding that they did this also to the American Natives. Surely we must change our ways of doing things with people who are apart of our society.In a 150 years we haven't changed our policies.
B00T73ATFW|5|Good condition! Like descriptions!
B00I6JOBTI|5|Best movie
B002MQYOFW|5|It had so much action and love. The main character in this book is amazing! She is a brave teenager who fights in the Hunger Games. She volunteers for her sister, Primrose Everdeen. She fights in the Hunger Games..... What happens next? Buy this amazing book!
B000002H2H|4|Ride the Lightning is second only to Master of Puppets in the Metallica library. The blinding speed of &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; and &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; is balanced by the subtle dirge of &quot;Fade  to Black.&quot; Only objection: &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; is a bit long  and repetitive. No biggie. An overpowering guitar sound and unearthly  vocals make this one a keeper.
1476751447|1|You have got to be kidding me!  THIS is the extent of this &#34;leaders&#34; awareness and insight into political, economic and historical forces in play around the world?  Man...I thought I was reading a high school essay.  Soon, this book will be stacked on the shelves of every dollar store around the nation.
6305508550|3|For all of those people who keep telling you that \\"you gotta see Office Space\\", tell them to relax. Yes, this movie is an overexaggerated look at the corporate world and it does a fine job of really making you feel that the characters in the movie have it pretty bad. All of the stereotypical office people are present, from the annoying operator (\\"please hold, please hold, please hold\\") to the degrading boss. But when people are telling you that's you're going to laugh for hours upon hours, then they obviously have not seen classic comedies like \\"Caddyshack\\" or \\"Animal House\\". This movie has many funny moments, but to rank it in the top 10 of all-time comedies is a complete joke.<br />So do yourself a favor and rent it. You'll laugh intermittently, and for an hour-and-a-half, it's a nice ride. But don't go thinking you're watching the greatest movie of all time. \\"Office Space\\" is a witty, entertaining look at the corporate world, but one that's a far cry from being uproarious.
B000VDUWMC|4|This careful analysis was very enlightening, explaining the global evolution of human societies and the origins of ancient and current inequalities.
B000N4SHPS|4|The Bottom Line:    Suprisingly just about everyone, Stallone decided to make a real movie with Rocky Balboa instead of the cartoons that had preceeded it; the only sequel that is true in spirit to the original, it can be a bit slow in the first half but it's a worthy film and a fine capper to the series.
B004IF8TLU|5|I love this movie, and you obviously can't go to redbox and get it because it's an old movie and rental stores don't exist, so here I am watching movies online!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Beautiful love story. Kept me wanting more. It's like \\"The Notebook\\" but a thousand times better. Now I need to know Hazel's ending...
B005KMX866|3|I am a really big Chris Issac fan and this is OK, but not one of my favorite CD's by him.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It's so fun to play
B00VFTAXUC|1|I want my 3 hours back... Predictable plot, bad acting.
0767836251|5|Cruel Intentions may be the most under-rated film that I have ever seen. What started as a leap of faith at the video stored soon became pleasent surprise, that was eventually replaced by an overwhelming awe at the lack  of critical acclaim surronding the film. A 90's version of the classic  Dangerous Liasons, created to expose the Generation X &amp; Y viewers to a  heavier dose of ligitimate drama in a contemporary setting.The young talent  in this film transformed into characters well beyond expected limitations.  Rarely am I taken by a film as I have been by Cruel Intentions. After you  see it once, you will see what my &quot;rambling&quot; is about.
B009IF8CH6|5|Every episode in every season has so far been hilarious!  The material is always fresh and funny, would reccomend to everyone.
B008P1EWIM|1|DON'T USE IT.
B00C8S9W0G|5|I can't wait for the next book! I feel I know the characters, they feel like family. I loved it!
B0011ZNAIC|5|We bought this for our 4 year old son, he has watched it before when he was younger, but this time round it is having so much more of an effect, i am glad we bought it - we don't have to \\"send it back\\"!
B00009YNGA|4|Very good service, on time delivery and tracking available. Definately recomend to shop here, saves time, gas, and money!!!!!!!! Keep up the good work.
B00006RIO7|4|greatest sountrack of all time maybe like the bodyguard.Catherine voice was amazing,stong,sexy,loud,she can be a singer if she want.<BR>   my favourite:all that jazz,when you're good to mama,class,nowaday,i move on,love is a crime.
B00006879E|4|This is very decent CD.  It sometimes reminds me a little bit of Jamiroquai's earlier albums, although it's not as intricate from a technical standpoint.  Be warned that some of the tracks sound slightly like B-sides from some crap boy band, but only slightly.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It finally came out on kindle! When I first saw it for free, I was all like ahhhhhhh :p I love this game  alot.....it challenges my brain..and most tim  My fingers xD<br />Download it, by meme &lt;3
B001GZ6QEC|5|Great movie, Great seller, even better price.... couldn't ask for more . ordered on 12-23-2011 and received it on 12-24-2011 !!
1476747016|5|As a cat owner, this had me in stitches, I just love it so much, I read it from start to finish in one sitting
B0083P1QUM|5|As always, Scarpetta/Cornwell deliver again. A great, cannot put the book down story. I read this book twice because it is so good.
B009KS4XRO|4|I like that there is a free tournament daily which allows me to build up some coin to play with. Great variety of games to play
B00004T9VY|5|Perfect packaging.  Fast delivery.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again.  A great remembrance of times gone by - great stevens' sound.
B00O8NOMRW|5|Old classic that wins the heart of my 8yo daughter along with her mother.
B00992CF6W|5|kids loved it and can't get them off of it!
B00ENYKLIK|5|A Wonderful movie
0767802659|2|I watched this movie hoping to see an at least semi accurate retelling of the book.  What i got however was speacil effect laden tripe, with an asinine soap opera subplot, thrown in for no conceivable reason.  The  acting is well, bad.  It reminds me of watching beveraly hills 90210 with  giant bugs in it.  I suppose that the pourpose that casting director had in  mind when choosing these &quot;actors&quot; was to provide a reasonable  exscuse to display the special effects. I think that maybe I could have  stomached the bad acting had it not been for the first degree homicide that  was inflicted upon the original story.  Trust me the co-ed shower scene,  and the main guy character's, and the main girl cahracter's tent scene,  were not in the original plot.  These were thrown in only to attract kids  to the movie.  Actually the only reason I gave two stars to this extended  made for tv movie was the fact that the sound and visual effects were  pretty to look at.  In short, only get this movie if you've never read the  book, or are easily entertained.
B003L7861E|5|What a wonderful, rich story - so uplifting and even if it borders unimaginable, it is so plausible and heartwarming.<br />Saw the movie (which was good too) but am so glad I read the book.  I like the novel's version much, much more.<br />Going to read it a second time.
B00KNFJDSW|5|Love this soundtrack, Love the Movie:)
B005LAIIPS|5|received on time ,and was exactly what we expected.. no problems at all with any part of the order .
B009H5IS1W|5|This is the best show and I can sit and watch back-to-back episodes for hours.  They are all so clever and it makes me see how important it is to be conscious of everything around me.  This show displays a high level of intelligence.  The cast is the absolute best.<br /><br />I never grow bored of watching.<br /><br />Judith N.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is addicting fun! I give 5 stars.
0684847817|5|I am an artist and I love drawong faeries, knombs, elves, and many more mystical creatures. This book inspired my soul.
B000VUCIZE|2|A book worth reading albeit tendentious at the end. I'm not however sure that it was a book worth writing
1400034779|4|I like this book because it is simply written, has interesting characters, and an uncomplicated plot. The setting, Botswana, and the use of a lady detective, are what make the story stand out. The reader gets a feel for what it is like to live in Botswana. The cases, the main character solves, do not involve elaborate plot twists.  There is a simplicity to the book that is refreshing. I recommend it.
B0028RXXE8|5|Starting with the titles, this series is superb.  Casting and acting couldn't be better.  The settings, inside and out, are reasonably authentic.  Each episode follows two soldiers and their families in contrast with several aristocratic families ,including, of course, the major players of the period -- Caesar, Mark Anthony, Octavio, and Cleopatra with their assorted entourages.  One caveat.  This is definitely X rated.
6305754969|5|Got this for my brother who is a john wayne fan.  Can't go wrong with this movie!!  It came in time for Christmas, and I know he's watched it once already
B005K17RU0|5|Great weather app and even found my small town! Happy to have the local weather available all the time. Definitely recommend.
B009LDD590|4|I like the politics behind it but my goodness the violence and the nude. In this season there are episodes with scenes of nudity that didnt even make sense or related to the plot. After a while it gets boaring b/c there is only one guy who can run things but we all know he wouldn't stay on top that long. But it can be entertaining and makes me grateful I'm alive now vs the 1920's.
B00BQXWH2O|5|Awesome!
B00F87ZUYG|5|This show is a little gory but it's got a really good story line. Some people like the blood and guts but I don't really like it. But it's the first show I have ever watched that I felt as though every episode is like an actual movie.
B000001DTM|5|Achtung Baby is the best U2 recording ever! The finest ballads and the stongest anthems are in it. &quot;One&quot; is, at the same time, a love-and-betryal song, and an emotional cry against AIDS. &quot;So  cruel&quot;, &quot;Who's gonna ride your wild horses&quot; and &quot;Ultra  violet&quot; are, in fact, the passion of four irishmen through lyrics and  music. &quot;Mysterious ways', &quot;Even better than the real thing&quot;  and &quot;The fly&quot; show us that the power of a good guitar-bass-drums  sound is never gone. And &quot;Tryin' to throw your arms around the  world&quot; gives us hope and stregth enough to keep doing it. Believe me:  I know U2 from A to Z and I can tell you: this is a masterpiece!
B0015AARJI|1|These controllers are absolute garbage.  The original controller that came with my PS3 that I bought years ago lasted for a few years.  I've bought 3 in the last 2 years, 2 of them have already given out.  On one of controllers, it just starts pressing buttons randomly for me.  On the other one, the R1 already gave out - this one I had for 6 months.  4 controllers, 3 crapped out, only 1 lasted more than 1 year.<br /><br />Horrible quality control by Sony.
B003IWYOF4|5|The movie was delivered to me 2 days ahead of schedule, it was a Christmas gift so that took the worry off wondering if it was gonna make it in time. It was exactly as described, and the package was unopened and damage free!
0061950726|5|Really good read.  Kept me interested and never got boring.  I am not a fan of chapters that switch from one person point of view to another but this one didn't bother me.  Couldn't put the book down.
B007J4T2G8|4|This was the fastest read I've had in years.  Was the writing  bad ?  Answer:Many times hilariously bad.  Truly, is Ana bites her lip one more time she  going to develop one nasty sore.  Is it believable? Only if you think a man can master helicopter flying, gliders, and playing Chopin in the dark while amassing billions of dollars.  Memorizing all of those musical selections is quite a feat in itself, even if someone has \\"long slender fingers\\"  And he clears dishes!! Would most women kick the dude's billionaire ass the first tried to lay her across his knee? Answer:  Hell yes! But knowing nothing about Red Rooms besides the Shining, I found it to be a pleasurable (and eye opening) summer read....
B004MNO0BQ|4|Great fun for all.....
B000O77SOK|5|If you love other law dramas this is perfect for you. For you law junkies it has just what you need, for those who don't know elements of first degree murder, it is for you too. Goes into courtroom drama, practice drama, and outside life drama. It is addicting, it is perfect.
0684867621|4|\\"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was a pretty good book. I only gave it four stars because I got lost alot in the book and could'nt figure out what he was talking about. Otherwise it is a great book. And it really isn't King's normal blood and gore book, it has a small part with a monster. But the book seemed to center more around a girl getting lost in the woods and struggles for survival.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Another masterpiece by Erik Larson, equally astonishing in the depth and insights of his research and the gripping quality of his prose. I cannot wait to start another book by this amazing author!
159420411X|5|This was bought as a gift. Was on my son's wish-list. He is very pleased. If he is pleased then I am pleased.
B00G3L6KQI|5|If you have read the previous two books, you will undoubtedly read this one.  You will not be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you have not read the previous two, what are you waiting for?
B00L9B7IKE|5|Congratulations Paula Hawkins. While I would have liked to see a few elements of this book tweaked, ie the technical research for the psychologist seemed very light, ditto the lack of rudimentary detective work on behalf of the cops, this is an amazing and compelling read that grabs the reader by the throat and carries them away. I find it hard to believe the average mystery reader could figure this out...I write books and I didn't have a clue until a glimmer 2/3 of the way in. Bravo for compelling and realistic characters and situations. If this was a 10th book, I might have rated it a 4, but I'm a grouch. Just very impressive, fun, wrap you up for a whole day read. Buy yourself a present, get this book.
B00364K6YW|5|Love this movie. The acting says as much or more than the words! Great chick-flick. My husband even watches with me!
B005LAII62|2|The stop motion animation was stunning , which accounts for one star. The actual overall story arc: fantastic; one more star. But that is it. All ruined by too many crass and tasteless moments.<br /><br />I was bothered by the way several of the characters were dressed/created with obvious sexual overtones. Too much adult humor and not enough playfulness. In fact, in the opening scene, Norman's mother asked him what he was up to and he replied, \\"Watching sex and violence\\". Really??? Personally, I wouldn't let any kid under the age of 12 to it. If you are planning on letting young kids watch, please read the parent's guide. And honestly, that didn't really paint a picture of how inappropriate some of the content is. I was extremely disappointed.
B00005K3PZ|5|When listening to this performance of the 2nd Symphony, I inately sense that there could be no better interpretation. No exaggeration, yet powerfully emotive and moving. This recording makes me love this early Bruckner symphony on a par with the massive 8th and 9th. Guilini brings the perfect subtlety, emotion, and phrasing detail without the slightest affectation. It combines a slow tempo and softness, yet at the same time, has power, authority, and drama. The slow movement is so heartfelt it's difficult for me not to shed a tear, even while listening in the car on a busy freeway. The playing and ensemble is excellent, sound quality very good 70s engineering, with perhaps a slight lack of dynamic range in the crescendos (very minor drawback). This performance is a great alternative to more aggressive and quicker performances, such as Wand's, which is an equally exciting way to do this symphony. But this Guilini/VSO performance is very exciting Bruckner.
B008Y6ZRBY|5|I love this movie and all the actors in it. This is one of my go to movies when its raining outside and I decide to sit with a hot cup of tea under the covers. Its a movie I loved watching with my mother, it is just all around great.
B008ACC9CM|1|I am very dissapointed.<br />When I first heard them sing on Britain's got talent, I was amazed.<br /><br />There seems to be a sound engineering problem on this CD, Jonathan sounds like he is singing to a microphone across the room.<br /><br />To make sure, I compared to them on youtube, with same sound system.<br />VERY big difference! It should be better on the CD, yet here it is the other way around.<br />So much that the CD is not nice to listen to. I listened to 3 songs from the CD and turned it off.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Together-Jonathan-Charlotte/product-reviews/B008ACC9CM/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1
B003XF1XOQ|5|A great ending to a fabulous trilogy, I couldn't put the book down since I started reading it. Thank you
B000002GVO|1|Once upon a time there was a country-rock band called the Eagles. Everyone who was not a hillbilly found them incredibly annoying. One day, they decided to write a song about a hotel in California and call it (Here comes the big surprise) Hotel California. They then put it on an album that sold a bunch of copies. However, all those poor people didn't know that they had wasted a lot of money on songs that either turn out to be an ingenious combination of annoying and boring. The song Hotel California is one of the best-known of all time but really is just a bunch of hillbillys trying to sing and write good songs but coming up way, way short. And the rest isn't much better.
B0031RS4V6|2|Done many times and doesn't deserve repeating
B00280LYHS|5|I am so sad to have finished the last book in this series. I want the story to continue! Great series.
B00AYB1RGG|3|Watched the original with Stallone when I was a kid. I suppose every movie seems better when you're a kid. While the plotline has changed, and the sidekick is kinda cute (subjective, but this is an opinion anyway), it's still somewhat predictable. Definitely some interesting moments though. Action's ok if you take into account that, as with most other action flicks, they dodge bullets with the best of them and seem to survive a lot that's thrown at them, including armor piercing rounds!
B0000024UO|5|why everybody likes johnny lang, is beyond me. johhny winter plays authentic blues to the point you may question if he shouldn't have been born black.  guitar players in search of some licks that will melt their  amps can learn from this. 'be careful with a fool' is full of the kind of  stuff that blazes. their is no question about it, this cd should be in your  collection.
B00475AYJQ|5|This is the start of an amazing series that is going to keep you waiting for the next book at the end of each day.  Get into Kvothe's story and be prepared to love it.
