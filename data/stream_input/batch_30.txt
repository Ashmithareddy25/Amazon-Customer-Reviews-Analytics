B000IY3KUK|5|My power steering is all better now.
B00JVHLS3G|4|I've seen several poor reviews about this being a &#34;sticker&#34;. That makes it sound like paper or thin plastic like a bumper sticker.  Yes, the emblem does have an adhesive back which is used to adhere it to the plastic mounting plate.  However, the emblem is about 3/32&#34; thick so it is not going to simply peel off. It may loosen over time and fly off, but so did my original factory installed hood emblem. I saw it fly over my head one day while driving 70MPH down the freeway. I got home and found I had a plastic mounting plate with what looked like construction adhesive on it.  Why in the heck would I pay BMW or some other OEM provider $40 for a new one that can fail just as easily?
B00CRPAHKE|5|Great
B0006VORDY|5|I love this, I use it for canning all summer and fall.
B0002KKHS8|5|good job for me
B002R1097O|5|Great items. Took less than 10 minutes to install.
B0002Q80GS|5|Very good kit
B002AO3JOS|5|as described  but hard to visualize on a black background
B010N7RW2S|5|Talk about awesome! This PowerCore Jump Starter could definitely save you in a bad situation. It can jump start your car, charge your dead phone and provide you with a flashlight or strobe light. All this is packed into a very attractive black fabric covered case. Inside the case is very organized - everything has a padded compartment or section to keep it all together. I'm very thankful that there are instructions on how to jump start your car with it! One thing that really makes this stand out from other portable battery devices that I have had is that this has an LED screen on it telling you exactly the percentage of battery you have left. My husband used it to jump start his car and it worked great.<br />The unit came fully charged. I charged my cell phone with it overnight and it didn't seem to take any longer to charge then when I use the wall outlet. I also noted that it only took 4% of the unit's charge to charge my phone. You do have to turn it to 'On' for charging and for flashlight use.<br />This would be great for anyone who travels to keep in their car. I will definitely take it with me on camping trips. It would also be wonderful to have during a power outage.<br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.
B00IZAEL66|1|whats happenig with my package
B00J73AWWC|5|Great product! Great service!
B009PJPFB6|4|The product was everything I thought it would be.
B00UL3ET4E|5|I'm we're happy dis products is perfect fit on my 2006 GMC ENVOY yes I bay again
B00II7RFKK|5|Terrific wheel for the price and all chrome to boot.<br /><br />Need some extra shimming but other than that its great.
B0018ELW2C|5|Works great. Looks good
B00J0ABS5M|5|My 2014 ram has a class V hitch, and has a adapter for the class three hitch that slides inside it. This makes the outside diameter about 3/4 inch wider so regular hitch pin is to short, so bought this locking pin to replace my shorter hitch pin. Lock is dependable and pin plenty strong for this application, price is very reasonable for this quality of product, amazon shipping was amazing received this about 24 hours after ordering using prime 2 day shipping!
B00063X7KG|5|Best product to use on your car
B0057WSJO0|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted/needed!
B00J1Z51RW|3|Somehow received this in 5 days as opposed to the approximately 4 weeks that Amazon suggests.  Fitment is great, but, the black rubber molding that surrounds the housing was kind of hanging off.  Inspect closely and re-glue if necessary.
B00XWVZ2T8|5|Black border, with chrome looking letters, only disappointment was that the letters are stickers, and CAN be peeled off, so if someone were to see that and be an a**, they could take the &#34;CHARGER&#34; off. So far been through car wash and intense heat, no visible damage to the stickers yet, great fit, easy to install. Not really surprised for how cheap it is though, great price
B00I6VTUWY|5|Everyone who drives a car with power windows should have one of these.
B002FRUR6S|5|Works great on a 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8.
B0016KABFC|5|Has no problem dragging my 17' bass boat on to the trailer !
B00LLKQXA4|5|Love it and it looks great, functional too.
B00WOH9G3O|5|Cool style, nice weight.  Mounts up nicely
B001CMEQSC|5|Its great! I use it on my outdoor camping kitchen setup. The switch clicks on as soon as you turn the knob and i use it to control a 12 volt Flowjet water pump. The pump has a pressure switch so the switch on the faucet is a little redundant but 2 shutoffs are better than one. If you have  a 12 volt pump without a pressure switch this is what you need.
B00H7MUY0U|3|fits great,but quality could have been better
B000CCMNAG|4|Works good.  Used on a gas generator and cleaned it up nice.
B004BH76V4|5|The fit was great,really helps block the heat,the steering wheel,dash,and seats etc.are not near as hot when you get in your vechicle.I've used this product for several weeks and really like it.
B007QBYRLE|5|Very good product
B00HRB447U|5|Great product to help prevent warping and fading of brakes.
B010SPPV1E|1|DO NOT BUY! This is a counterfeit product! I didn't catch this until it arrived and I tried to install it, as I bought it with a number of other products. It does not fit securely and the instructions it came with are a bad quality photocopy of the actual Mopar install guide.
B001C6CBQC|5|Great discs, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS, the difference in Left and Right for the front axles is important, these brakes are 'double' layer with a vent in the middle. Keep in mind, that the wear on the pads will be slightly higher than before (eg more dust).
B004SJAY8M|4|Nice but I wish it was brighter when breaking . I will recommend . It's bright when on.
B008Y8WA62|5|as described
B000C8ZB1I|4|The bolts are welded to the mount instead of beinf rivited studs like the stock one. Makes it sit somewhat unlevel but not a big deal.
B00BHH1QT4|2|it didnt really worked well... thou when it did it was confortable
B009K4H42Y|5|Great price
B000WK8XEI|5|Its fork oil
B001HATY36|3|Make sure it fits your trailer. Looks like one swift blow with a hammer it would fall off
B000BZI150|5|Everything was good
B003RYMPUY|4|Installed in my 07 wrx, had a couple misfire codes at 56k miles. all codes went away, just make sure you check the gaps. some at .032 some at .027
B005IV0FN8|2|It's a cheap product. I installed it on my bike and hasn't ridden more than 10 miles when the lens cover blew off leaving the LED bulbs completely exposed. Fortunately a friend riding behind me noticed and picked up the cover.  After super gluing it back together it seems to be holding... For now.  I expect that I'll need to buy better lights in the near future.
B010DP8PIU|5|We’ve also seen external battery packs before but how about an external battery pack that also allows you to jump start your car? Now that’s cool right? The Anker Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger offers 10,000 mAh of recharging power for your USB compatible devices. It also has the added benefit of being able to restart the dead battery in your car should the need arise. This is 100X better than a traditional lead acid battery jump starter that weights almost 50lbs.<br />Inside the packaging you’ll find the battery along with the jumper cables, a wall charger, a car charger, a micro USB cable and set of instructions.<br />Before using the battery you’ll need to charge it up. To do so you use the included wall charger. It takes about 3 hours to full charge up the battery. A short press of the power button lights up the LED indicators which display the battery’s power level. There are four LEDs, each representing 25% of the battery’s power.<br />The battery has two USB ports, which you can use to recharge your mobile devices. One port offers 1A of power and is meant for cell phones and other smaller handheld devices. The other port offers 2.1A and can be used for tablets. There’s 10,000 mAh of power for you to use to charge up your devices.<br />There’s also a flashlight at the end of the battery that can be toggled into three different modes. A regular light, a short pulse and a longer strobe. To turn the flashlight on simply press and hold the power button. To turn it off press and hold the power button again.<br />External battery packs are great but one that can also jump start your car is better. The Anker Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger isn’t much larger than a standard battery pack but the added feature might just save you from ending up being stranded somewhere with a car that won’t start. Charge up the Anker Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger and leave it in your car for emergency situations. You’ll feel safer knowing it’s there.feel safer knowing it’s there.
B0056BOD9C|3|perfect bottle opener!
B0024E6W02|3|Works as advertised
B00M7Z2CQQ|5|Excellent quality, the nesting really helps to save space in an RV. The only nit, and it's a small one, is that the handle is heavy enough to tip the pots over if they don't have much in them and they are slightly off center on the burner support. Simple solution to that problem is just to center the pot on the burner or remove the handle when it's not needed to lift the pot. 2 seconds to put the handle on or take it off. I was initially concerned that it would be difficult to stir things in a square pot but the corners are rounded enough that there is no problem. I bought the frying pan as well as this set of pots and am very pleased with that as well.
B000BZG8ZA|5|Product fit my 98 Ford Ranger 4.0 perfectly.
B00VJBERIK|1|The first bulb was clearly not a 50 watts equivalent--at most 25 watts.  The second bulb was clearly not a warm white--but a very cool white.  I am returning this pack.  Does anybody have any suggestion for a good LED solution for this?
B008N8IMLA|4|will work fine for correct gauge wire.
B00407XAGK|5|good color match and sprayed even
B000AMZK4Y|5|OEM Molar as advertised

B00Y8SH63E|5|Husband loves his new pegs
B00746LCVY|5|Great size for operating with just your palm.. I did have to replace the 7screw though. Phillips just was strong enough to get it tight. Otherwise, I love it..
B000F285EG|5|perfect
B00842A7F4|5|just what i needed
B007T7TPE4|5|Great replacement for worn out hood struts on my 2004 Grand Cherokee at a fraction of dealer cost!
B00HJ6O4A0|5|this is durable and easy to clean<br />we love it for picnics and beach
B000GU58PG|5|Good product fit great!
B00BSG3AIE|2|Not warm white but ice white. Already lost 3 bulbs right out of the pack
B00PK0WXDW|4|Not nearly as bright as the 10W G4 halogen I replaced, but it doesnt get as hot either. I had 24 of these lights on my boat. All the halogens powered on used to draw close to 8 amps. all 24 of these on barely draw 2 amps.
B001CA9CN8|5|Hello, I ordered one of these for my 2013 Navigator and when it arrived I experienced the same issue many on here have. I talked with the dealer and Ford has redesigned these filters for better airflow so the new filters they manufacture have no fibers inside but are the disks with holes in it. Apparently the engineers said it is okay and these are acceptable replacements for the fiber filters. You may still get a fiber filter depending on who sells it and how old their stock is but do not be distraught if you get a filter like the one pictured.
B0043X48VC|5|Decent quality, nice fit. They fit over 2 of 3 pair of my prescription glasses. Cannot beat them for the price.
B00RH3AMIS|5|Just as described.
B010TWOQGW|4|Nice pegs. Built well and strong. They are flat and rounded so foot tends to slide a bit. But for the price compared to others, its worth it.
B0040CTUAA|5|Very satisfied
B00RK8SMF0|3|At first I was actually kind of disappointed in this because it fits kind of loose and doesn't really conform to my key fob. But thinking it over, I realized that it fits as well as can be expected. There's a bit of a pooch around the opening, but it's not like they can make it any tighter. The rest of the case fits nicely and the buttons and everything work fine. The only trouble is that the wide opening sometimes catches inside my bag, and I'm worried it will eventually rip or tear.<br /><br />Still, I'm happy with my purchase and will continue to use it as long as I can.
B00132CG4M|5|got it installed, perfect for that heavy gate
B00R6S0MEI|5|Great nozzle.<br />Good pressure on well water.<br />Simple to use.  Delivers a good stream of water for watering plants, washing boats/cars, etc.<br />Best nozzle we've ever bought.
B004G9VIXE|5|works great
B0034ZUZM6|5|Great winch for the price. I did have to purchase a mounting plate for my specific winch. But other than that I'm pretty happy with my purchase. Everything it comes with seems to be of very good quality and it defiantly works great. I was able to pull a buddy's atv out of a 4 foot deep water/mud pit. With the front end locked up. It was pulling mud in front of the tires as well. Pulled it out easily. Great winch for the money and I really only have 2 complaints. First if there was a switch that you could mount somewhere to unlock the free spin that would be great. When your entire atv is almost under water and your stuck it's hard to get to the unlock on the winch without nearly falling in yourself. It would be great if there were a switch on the handlebars or something for unlocking the freespin. I would still want the winch to have it on the side as a backup just in case. Also. One time I unlocked the freespin and it wouldn't pull out in free spin. I had to lock It in and use the switch reverse to get the cable out. This was probably my fault because it was covered in mud. And probably is the same way even with high end winches. Overall I am more than happy with the winch for the money and would highly reccomend.
B00OV99LJM|5|These have a great feel and seem to be very well made! Well worth the price! Buy cheep, buy twice, but these will out-last all ur other tools
B00URKCHQ8|5|The seat belt in this car dug into my neck something terrible.  The extension took care of the problem wonderfully.
B00UVXDIS2|5|These r neat.
B00Q5YI5KW|4|Shipping took forever. Quality is decent.
B00265M9SS|1|This would be great if the parts most under stress (the plunger which the handle pulls out to create vacuum) weren't made of plastic.  It will inevitably break and the handle will fall off.  Sad.  They do make a more expensive all metal version of this, but why not simply use metal where it's most needed?  At the price point for the plastic model, it should be made to last.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Thee are Great!!!!!!
B000B8JUM0|5|This fit my TJ perfectly.  It was slightly smaller (top part of cap) than the OEM, but works well. No issues here.
B002WP362U|1|This was the first time I had ever worked with any sort of acoustic mat product. I didn't know what all would be involved with the installation. I bought this in a combination package with the Dynamat roller. I was thinking that this would be used to close any gaps between various pieces of mat.<br />Now that all the mat material is in the car, I still have no clue what this tape is for. It's completely unnecessary as far as I can tell. The different pieces of mat don't need to have the gaps completely closed to the point that not a single square centimeter of space is uncovered. The installation is just not that critical. So if you get a few gaps here and there, don't worry about them. If you have any pieces overlap other pieces, just mash them down well with the roller or a tennis ball and you're good to go.
B00IUE5OPO|5|Let my brother try this because he said, &#34;you spent too much.&#34; Following the directions, he waited looking at his watch then wiped. All he could say was, &#34;Wow.&#34;<br />If you have a car worth waxing, then you need this: accept nothing less.
B00EBEV4OW|1|It stopped working after a week
B000GZPCY8|5|fits perfect works great
B00EO4Q1NS|5|Fit  my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly. Used to connect the Hopkins Insight.
B00YEQMOKA|5|SUPER SUPER BRIGHT!@@@!!!! but i returned it cause it didnt fit in my light housing˜!!!! (tail light benz c300) man i wish they fit..... oh wells.... time to look for something else....
B00EN0EC6Q|5|Great fit....easy install.  Really finishes off those ugly rear wheel wheels.  This is a pretty heavy duty plastic so it should hold up as well as oem.
B000W1XX4M|5|A must if your adding a Test pipe, or high flow cat on you're vehicle and do not want a check engine light to come on !
B005N53C9I|5|These were very easy to install and fit my grand daughter's Subaru very well.
B001DRJN2K|5|Fit the space properly and helped the cabin air quality improve.

B00074Q29W|5|Works great.great price.fast shipping
B00BQWQN1Q|5|These are much brighter than the stock foglight bulbs I had on my 2010 Legacy.
B005G197D4|5|Perfect
B000CPAVJ8|4|It was not as bright pink as I wanted
B0130NLX8G|5|I love that I can clip it on and off for this reason I plan on using it for my stroller as well.  The inside being made of thick plastic that can be wiped off is a must.  The size is perfect for a standard grocery bag to go into for quick clean-outs.  I left some empty bags at the bottom for refills.  The side pockets are going to be used for wipes and hand sanitizer.  The top can be left open or velcro closed without zipping or any extra effort.  This would make a nice place for cups and snacks that I am sure will keep them cooler.  I am loving this and that it keeps things neat and keeps nescessary things close at hand.  Thanks for a  great product.
B00AOA2POU|1|The third row does not fit......disapointed
B0010ECUIA|5|Fit the empty hole where there should have been a filter. Hope the previous owner didn't pay a lot to have the filter replaced.
B000CIY0U6|1|Despite Amazon's fitment check telling me the item fits my 2015 GMC Sierra Double Cab it does not.  Well it would if I cut 4 inches off the length and about 3 inches off the height.
B012HIFV10|5|Very good
B001RKH7FS|3|I loved this product the only thing is the plug melted in the cigrette lighter and I am not sure how to get a replacement.
B0099WJ65A|1|Didn't come with the smaller attachment which is what I wanted most it gets the spots I can't reach waste of money without that.
B00LV58ZZK|5|This set was surprisingly good! Comes with exactly what is in the picture. They look far nicer than the cheap flat plates, but are priced below some other also nice sets. Contains plates to block off exhaust manifold flanges for both the Secondary AIR injection system, and EGR system on an LS1.<br />Also has good quality hardware and gaskets. Bolts require a metric Allen wrench and a bit of soreness to get tight, unless you have a hex bit and socket.<br /><br />The EGR removal also leaves a gaping hole on top of your plastic intake manifold, this hole is 35mm wide (or 1-3/8&#34;).<br />To plug the intake hole, I used a 1-3/8 inch galvanized steel &#34;freeze plug&#34; from NAPA, though a 35mm will also work. Cleaned the soot from intake hole with mild solvent, and pressed the plug in facing down with a socket and tap hammer.<br /><br />This worked fine, but I wanted a more finished look and redundant seal, So I put a thin bead of RTV sealer around the edge of the plug, and inserted a second steel freeze plug facing upward showing a nice finish. tapped into place and it sits almost flush with the top of the manifold. Dope!<br /><br />Not all cars are the same! This was used on a '99 Trans Am, The 2001-02 and pre-'98 LS1 F-Bodies are believed to be different, the later cars also have a vacuum hose and device attached from the back of intake manifold to the AIR system, you will need to plug this vacuum leak with a Vacuum Connector and Cap, along with a Freeze plug (or two) for the front of the intake where the EGR hose is bolted to.<br /><br />Air pump removal is from the bottom behind the driver side driving light and side marker. You can either unbolt the four bolts holding pump to bracket (horizontal ones, surrounding pump housing facing inboard) or remove the whole bracket by taking out the four vertical bolts higher up. I removed the bracket as an assembly; Those four bolt require a 10mm socket and a foot long plus extension. Also might help to unbolt the two forward wheel well cover bolts allowing easier access to the air pump bracket bolts. Ware eye protection, or you might get sand and a grasshopper in your eye.<br /><br />Shopping List;<br />This set of EGR & AIR block-off plates, gaskets, bolts.<br />2 Freeze Plugs, 1-3/8&#34; or 35mm [[ASIN:B0011N35FC Dorman 555-025 Expansion Plug]]<br />Vacuum Connectors, Straight style assorted - These might work [[ASIN:B001C0F4DU Dorman 47307 Vacuum Connector Assortment]]<br />Vacuum Caps assorted. - One of these should also work [[ASIN:B000COB5TE Dorman Help! 41050 Vacuum Cap Asst]]
B00BUHMH08|5|Does not fit all jag X350 XJ series. Depends on VIN.
B001OEE24Q|5|Product as described and arrived earlier then expected.
B008X031AA|5|Just installed. No noise. We will see in time.
B00EKTJHCO|5|The Tahoe looks great along with the half tailgate cover.
B00D88Q54Q|5|Worked great like its supposed to. Bought these to replace worn out clips on my 07 Audi A3 3.2 s-line
B00VNBDWPK|4|The lights are awesome. They are very bright and working perfectly so far. No complaints. I ordered 2 units. One of the box initially when ordered came with 3 capacitors and only one polarity adaptor. I notified the seller next day upon delivery. Nobody got back to me for a week. After the second contact upon mentioning about placing a complaint with Amazon  they took care of the problem immediately. Def 5 stars if they were prompt in their after sales service.
B00HFL2TJ2|5|Genuine AC Delco part without the dealer cost.
B000EQR7XS|5|Perfect fit.
B00F675WNW|5|Such a simple installation! Don't let a dealer charge you 2+ hours worth of labor and twice as much for the part as you should pay. I'm not a mechanic and I installed this into my daughter's 2010 Cobalt in under 20 minutes. Simply search YouTube for videos based on your car's diagnostic code - P0012 or P0013 for this part or P0010 or P0011 for the Intake.<br /><br />When you replace this part, be sure to replace its sister at the same time. It will be the Intake position actuator. It's right next to the Exhaust one - this one.  They are two different parts you'll have to order, and in the experiences of myself and everyone I've read about, they go bad within about one oil change of each other.
B00NRVC6UG|5|Kensun truly is dedicated to customer satisfaction. When originally installed they just weren't quite right, but Bradley from Kensun Customer Service reached out to me and sent me a relay harness and replacement bulbs free of charge. Made up for everything, thank you Kensun!
B013H2OJOK|5|The hubcaps work great and fit perfectly on my Toyota Corolla. A very good product at a great price!
B009YYVSZO|5|Original
B008GGJIHG|5|Works great on my e46. No fitment issues. Took 30 seconds to install.
B004NFU300|5|I just got finished applying my first treatment to Aquapel to my windshield.  I was a little concerned about the application process from some of the other reviews, but I looked up the official Aquapel application tutorial video on YouTube and I strongly urge you to do this and watch the short video before beginning.  This will let YOU interpret the application process before hand and give you a clear understanding of how to do it.  It is very simple, it is not in anyway a grueling or stressful process.  Make sure you are prepared with a whole roll of paper towels like the video says- you will not need an entire roll but its better to have an ample supply on hand. Wear gloves and I will not apply this again without some kind of facial mask to protect my airways, this stuff is no joke and highly toxic and I do not recommend taking any chances by breathing it in.  I held a large wad of clean paper towels to my face this time and that worked fine. Don't apply this with kids or pets around, and make sure you are applying it in a well ventilated area.  Discard of the waste properly, I used the used paper towels to wrap the discarded pack and then put everything in a plastic bag and tied it firmly.  Also, clean the glass you are applying Aquapel to -very well before application, I cleaned mine twice.  I really like the applicator on this product, I thought it was was easy to use and you can just chuck everything once you are done.  You don't have to worry about having an open bottle of this stuff laying around. I thought there was ample solution included in the vial, some other reviews stated there isn't enough solution- the tutorial video brings up a very smart tip regarding this- use the tinted border of the windshield as a guide for application.  I tried this and ended up doing my whole windshield because I had plenty of solution I have a 2004 Toyota Matrix and I think my windshield is pretty large.<br /><br />I really liked how Aquapel is applied and thought it was very easy, it took me about 20 mins (and I did stare adoringly at my gleaming windshield for a few mins after I was done) so I am sold as far as application goes.  This is my first time using Aquapel so I cannot comment on its performance yet but I will update in a few weeks (or next time it rains) .  It gets 5 stars right now though, because it was fast and easy to apply and clean up is pretty much non existent.  I have high hopes for this product and firmly believe I will be a loyal customer for years to come!
B010935J8U|3|Looks great! Many compliments on the look.
B0009IK5U8|5|they fit perfectly in my 2011 Nissan sentra and work good.
B00HCOW3OI|5|Works very good since installation about three months ago, no problem
B00NJ3KYGU|5|They are bright, delivered next day with Prime.suoer easy installation and gives the car a much updated look. I drive mostly city and not rural do the light intensity is fine for me.
B0002JN2EU|5|Works great on small engines 2 and 4 stroke weed whacker, lawn mowers and snow blowers. Lawnmower starts on first pull now since using this. Snow blower started in 3 pulls in below 20 degree temps. I havent tried this in a car yet so I cannot speak on that.
B00X92DXZ0|4|It's nice even though I had a hard time to put the back seat cover on my bmw 3 series because I can't fold the back chair.
B002VFH5J6|3|Filter fabric is thin but is no worse than the one that came with the vehicle. However, it is half the price of the dealership filter.
B00B8YA66A|5|Popped these right into the rear hatch of my parents pathfinder with nothing more than a screwdriver. They seem even more firm than the original springs. Easy fix for an incredibly annoying problem
B00OJ65560|5|Really helped with the trailer shelving.
B00A82C3VO|5|works perfectly
B005465G4A|3|Nice but part of the decal didn't transfer upon application.
B001DH4BYU|5|Great part.  Works perfect in my 2004 expedition
B00QFY2BCK|5|This cleaner really works!!!!!!! My headlights are extremely clear!!!!!!!!
B00FY85KNU|4|Excellent product, good price.
B003VLBPJA|2|It's not very secure. The hooks are too little and they bent right away. I did appreciate the ends of the hooks having rubber caps so that it didn't scratch up my paint. I know it's cheap but I have a ten dollar one that works way better that I got at Fleet Farm.
B00P99KKAM|5|Fast shipping, great product.
B00HSLZRWK|4|The panel and controller work as advertised.  Installation was straight forward as is use.  I did encounter a problem with cable length which was hugely frustrating.  For marine applications that may require complicated routing , (mine was installed on a Catalina 30 sailboat on deck, directly under the boom), I ended up about eight feet short.  Finding additional cable to complete the job in the area was a major challenge.
B000GTMIL4|4|Incredibly useful, very strong, well put together.  The only reason it is not four stars is because the actual bolt is a little too long for mist tight spaces.  On my vehicle, the pitman arm is directly above a frame crossmember when installed, and this does not fit with the bolt that came with it.  Luckily, I was able to source an alternate grade 8 bolt from Fastenal and make it work.
B00GWFOPTO|5|Exactly what I needed but shipping was high.
B002XYZYBG|5|So far so good and although it was made of plastic, the pot metal of the original was worse. As a bonus, the hard to open and lock the door issues disappeared.
B0006IX85K|5|as promised, prompt ship.
B000CNBI1A|5|This stuff is awesome! If its metal, chrome, silver or even gold this stuff will make it shine! I would recommend wearing some gloves. It gets messy at the end of a cleanup project. It's an excellent choice for metal polishing.
B004HCOE8Q|5|Love it, used it two times, plenty left, thanks
B00L7X9NXO|4|I love the look these gave my 2003 Chevy Silverado. They are so sharp and bright! The only thing wrong is that one of the little LED lights is out. But it's hardly noticeable.. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
B00KMYYS20|5|Provides excellent waterproofing on houseboat party tops
B00A2EH6YC|5|I want it
B001OD2OCY|5|High quality wires.<br />They should be soldered and the connection covered by heat-shrink, but that process is very simple.
B000BZI4K2|5|Product fit my 98 Ford Ranger 4.0 perfectly.
B006R0FKPC|4|working fine
B00G3EAGFG|5|Good clay bar. Works as I expected it too. pulled quite a bit of dirt off the wife’s car.
B003RQBKLC|3|the USB 2.a A not extremely fast as i thought<br />the sticker for holding the product not strong and fall after 3 hour
B007ZGKKMA|5|These are great general lights, tough case.  We use them for mounting on equipment or under four wheeler racks because of the lite power draw.  Amazon is half the price of what my local hdwr. store wants for them.
B000M6YC1U|5|As good as the original. Works good.
B001ONOS14|5|Worked well to lower my 7&#34; PIAA lights. The earlier set created a huge blind spot with the light and hinge mounted mirror. These brackets solved the problem. Hardware leaves a lot to besired, allen heads twisted right out and powder coat looks more like rattle can primer.
B00B1VBQRS|3|Royal purple had been a good brand for me. This product, however seemed modest. I didnt notice any real change in performance or MPG. Ill probobly test others before buying this again.
B00FT2GFGC|5|fit my car
B00ENTYLGI|3|Product works fine. Not very night as advertised.
B008ZU818U|5|True to size, very comfortable, totally love them. They are perfect for warm weather, I'm a Floridian
B000C9DMB8|5|These were perfect fit. Worked greatly
B000E472DK|2|I expected this to have an adhesive, not a maginet
B000S2UGWC|5|Great product
B00HFK2R8G|1|When we first got them, they were great for the first 8 months. Then the low beams completely stopped working and now one is not working at all. Your listing says up to 30,000 hours, though only 500 hrs in and no phone number to call for warranty. Very disappointed.
B001V8U3J8|5|fits awesome
B003G39SDI|5|It's an air filter. What can I say.
B00GF4U5RI|1|1. The product deacription led me to believe these were for the front windshield. They aren't. They are child sun shades for the rear side windows.<br />2. They provide no shade they are so sheer.<br />3. Despite the pictures shown you can barely make out the graphic on them.<br />Do NOT buy. I am returning mine.
B003RWU7FG|4|used daily
B000GKMWR8|5|Works great. 2nd TracRac product I've owed.
B00CBDIJ98|5|Was concerned about the usability of the visor clip, but it attaches easily and can be removed with one hand (contrary to some other posts).  Product works as advertised and is very affordable.
B000R4PFFO|5|After a summer on the lake my seats started to look dull, the cleaner is very easy to apply and does a remarkably good job. They look brand new again.
B00CRR5L8U|5|still running
B00768A3TW|5|Arrived and my 10 year old daughter loves it. The aux audio in jack is perfect and on our last trip she requested we turn off the XM radio on her headset and she listened to her own music on the trip. She likes having her own volume control and she says it was comfortable (first trip was 1.5 hours). We did bend it out a little in the middle so it was not so tight on the ears.<br /><br />It seems like a solid built unit and we expect it to last a long time.
B000F09CF4|5|The best penetrating fluid out there.  I use it whenever I can.  Its a bit expensive for what you get, so for large projects where I need to submerge something I use a big batch of Ed's Red I mixed up. Do an internet search for it, its similar to Kroil but made from regular things you can buy and mix yourself.
B000E28N1W|5|Thanx
B008DL2D1W|5|Great product
B00JSJMTE4|5|Fast shipping, great product.
B00153VJRO|5|Right on
B0002JM9NU|1|Poorly made. Flimsy material.
B0092QWD9O|1|1. VERY SLOW SHIPPING!!<br />2. GE web commerce site only takes Paypal<br />3. WattStation phone app (to locate networked chargers) drains battery in few hour when allowed to remain on in background<br />4. Other competitors offer access card for FREE.<br />5. Phone app routinely crashes and often will not connect - leaving me stranded at charger until it functions (as long as 30 minutes). I'd use the card, but it STILL HASN'T BEEN DELIVERED.<br />6. If you have any other alternative, use it. GE WattStation is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!
B003YK96YO|5|This thing is great, I use it almost every day.
B001DRLQN4|5|A+
B00JAIY8SI|5|Great sealant<br />Good adhesion flow and quick setup of outer skin
B009MATM3U|5|I have a black with black interior camry. It gets freaking hot in Texas - of course, and this window shield is the best. It fits perfectly (2014.5 Camry Hybrid) and keeps my car infinitely cooler.  I no longer fry my hand on the steering wheel.<br />It is not difficult to roll up and fits easily into the window. I was concerned because I saw a few reviews where the customer said it was both difficult to roll up and did not fit as expected.<br />It has a Velcro strap that keeps it together when rolled up.  It unrolls easily and fits snuggly in place.  No issues with it at all.
B0027J9O0O|2|Short!  Not 6' by any means, no mater how you stretch it. Compressed
B00THP4BYK|5|Great plastics and fit the bike perfectly.  Bought them to replace the broken plastics on my sons Honda XR50.
B0024E6V30|4|Works well. Run a small amount of water through it first and you will see charcoal come out  then fill up.
B00RPO0MXE|5|Love it
B00JAPAY34|5|High a low Beams are must! this is the perfect solution for motorcycles and cars!
B00DSD4ITK|2|The top hat was broke off?
B000F6F99G|3|Husband wasn't ga ga over it......requires an electrical outlet which requires wiring or a long extension cord. Didn't think of that when purchased.
B002P8EMRW|5|Fits and does the job. Got these since I have nitrogen in my tires and it comes with 50 caps. I was surprised they were pretty much the only company that sells green tire caps.
B001C6L5XC|5|Much cheaper than through the Ford dealership and every bit as good!
B00P2D3VT2|5|What a difference  this little  Led Bulb makes in the interior  of  my  truck . Easy installation. Glad I pulled  the  trigger .
B00SSC2UZU|3|I grabbed these to replace my corroded factory mirrors. Seemed like the best choice a OEMs have disappeared. I keep tightning up the adjuster and they still move around. Expected more.
B0023UPORY|5|Excellent Product & Deal.
B00N5TYLLC|5|I love it.its simple and light weight.doesnt scratch up my triple tree clamp area because its rubber or silicone.
B001Q96Y7C|1|I really really liked the design, however it did smell pretty bad.<br /><br />And it clearly reads on the package that it contains chemicals that can cause cancer, and birth defects.<br /><br />Not sure why they are still selling this product if it can be harmful.<br /><br />But...Thank you for issuing my refund right away. That was very prompt, and I did not even have to send the item back.
B0050ITGM0|4|Great Deal
B0038AVEBI|5|They are awesome
B00CDZ4OJ8|4|Hi,<br />Does this kit fits the 1999 FORD Explorer 4 Four wheel Drive<br />And want to know if this kit is complete,
B00DTBU6AG|5|Saw this on my way back from Sturgis when I put in almost 5000 miles on my bike in two weeks.  It seems that it is a very good product and time will tell.  It is a lot more comfortable that the seat I had on previously.  I hope it will be as comfortable in the long run.
B00ECXSXT6|5|The decal was very easy to apply to my car and looks really great.
B00SI6NXYS|4|Not a perfect fit but OK
B000NJ6EZ8|5|Good stuff works great
B0030G7XWY|4|The interior trim piece did not extend up through the roof quite enough to mate with the vent trim.  All in all it is a nice product though.
B00R23J9AU|1|Too big falls off the connecting rods for the door lock and handle.
B00SAT6Y08|3|These are fine jumper cables, but I'm deducing 2 stars because I don't enjoy being solicited to review products; I consider that to be part of the product experience. To be fair, not everyone finds these e-mails annoying, but I do.
B00L84L6D2|5|Worked great excellent value
B0018C85VK|5|Perfect fit great product
B00KM7LPPU|5|I bought this visor and received an email from the company that same day telling me that the visor I ordered wouldn't fit my helmet (also ordered through them.)  I told them to go ahead and send me the right one and they did without making me go through any kind of annoying processes.  The visor itself is exactly what I wanted.  Totally reflective, and darkens and acts like a pair of sunglasses.  Also notable is that it doesn't make it too dark to ride at night.  You can definitely see less but it isn't unsafe and you can still use it.
B0095TEFNA|5|Used these to replace the factory vents in my 2015 Keystone travel trailer. Needed to be able to adjust or shut off air flow in some areas to allow more A/C at the other end of the trailer. These popped right into the original vent frames and work perfectly!
B0013THZ3M|4|Put the spark back in my mower
B000CP86ZE|5|fit just right
B000K0080W|5|OK Kind of pricey but best I found
B00T5U9LQK|5|Great fit and quality a+++++
B002SSBPLA|5|Does the job! Definitely a good buy.
B000182EWS|2|Wrong ones.
B008MISDH4|5|Just what the Doctor ordered.
B00IZS9AVE|5|Excellent OEM quality spark plugs which fitted perfectly.
B004J10MTK|5|Fit perfect for suzuki forenza 2005
B00VSPQPC8|5|The best feeling in the world is when you buy something that you think can't possibly be this cheap and actually work.  That's how I feel with this thing.<br />It worked brilliantly and did the same thing as the $100+ scanners.  This was on a Volkswagon Beetle.  Hooked it up , turned the ignition on(not starting the car) and it read the codes immediately.  Then to my amazement it actually did erase the errors.  Best money I have ever spent.
B00BQWQLP4|5|it is the best one to buy.  very bright lots of light
B000XBBISO|4|Worked better than the original factory unit. I like the Brass Stem rather than the factory Plastic.
B00LARS63K|5|Best car seat cover I've ever owned! The prior seat cover I used would slip and move, and never really hugged the seat. However, the Happeseat stays in place, is very attractive, washed and dries up well, and keeps my seats clean. The pups like them as well as they are quite soft. I have orange and green, and truly, if you need a cover to protect your seat, this is perfect!
B0067UAUA2|5|Works perfectly. Saved me hundreds of dollars
B0087NAWYQ|4|Good
B001D9E41I|5|had it up for a few months now and still holdin on
B00GGQM9CO|5|Went on in about ten minutes, fit perfect. These seem better than stock, very happy with these. 1996 3.2 TL.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|Works great
B00I3E2558|5|I love these mats a great product and a great price. The company that makes these also has great customer service.
B00NZ9KS0K|5|Thank you for the great application and care instructions--very helpful. I wish I could post a photo of my motorcycle as well so you all could see how they look. These decals look great and even several men have commented that they love it and ask where did I get them.
B0009H519Y|5|This stuff works great.
B00H9796AC|5|Love, love, love these!  They fit perfect, are durable and easy to clean.
B00OLVG5IU|1|This bed mat for my 2015 F 150 arrived very poorly cut and trimmed. All sides were raggedly cut, tailgate end had a split in it and even the raised finished trim edging was actually cut off with only a 4 inch piece of trim left on the mat! The rest of the edge was a ragged threaded mess. The retailer where I ordered it was a little surprised about the delivered condition. I supplied my retailer with multiple photos, two are attached in this review. They in turn had to connect with DeeZee to take it back. My retailer then sent out a mat made by Protecta (and I believe manufactured by a company called KN Rubber Co.).This mat is very well made and cut, the fit is very good, and 2 bucks cheaper. Before I chose the DeeZee mat, I read a review by someone that said his mat looked like it was cut and trimmed by a fifth grader. He was right. BTW my thanks to my retailer RealTruck.com for handling this issue expertly.
B001KS2R34|5|Worked perfectly, super easy to install in my 2007 Jeep Patriot.
B00GRSOJSS|3|I really like that this product is environmentally friendly, but it turned one of my antiques blue! I don't know why because the material was listed as safe to use evapo-rust on.
B007TYB2VQ|5|delivered quickly, product exactly as described and fit perfectly. easy to install and a lot cheaper than the dealer wanted for the same thing!
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Product itself was fine but I just wouldn't call it a Jumbo. Bought this to go into my daughter's 2013 Ford Focus. It didn't fit, it's too small (and the Focus isn't exactly a big car).<br /><br />So just a head's up: take the &#34;Jumbo&#34; part for what you will. Otherwise, they do work.
B00873J0YY|3|works as advertised.  there are better on the market but with better you will pay for it.  good for the price
B00TO9H66O|4|First, I would like to say that I have been a Jeep guy and outdoorsman for most of my life. I take on average 10-12 trips a year off roading, kayaking and tent camping. I was looking at the Yeti coolers and similar ones which brought me to the Caribou Cooler.  Cost point: Great price when compared to coolers in the same demographic.  First Impressions: When I first unpacked my Caribou Cooler I was surprised at the weight of it, much heavier than traditional 58 qt. coolers.  Heavy is good, heavy is sign of reliability! Impressive and well built. Being an off road enthusiast I appreciate things that are built to last.  First trip/use: I loaded my cooler on a Wednesday afternoon with drinks and food using a combo of block ice and cubes. It was about 80 degrees outside at the time. I left on Friday afternoon. I discovered about 10 ccs of water had leaked out from the drain plug area. That was my fault I did not check that the plug was properly secured when I first loaded. Saturday morning the Block Ice was good to go and about 60 percent of the cubes had melted.  Considering midday on Thursday and Friday the temp had been in the high 80s.  Further use: I have gone on 3 additional trips and great performance from my cooler. However, after empting and drying my Caribou Cooler I discovered the plastic on the inside of the cooler floor was warped/bubbling. I have used nothing but fresh water to clean out the cooler.  I will keep an eye on that and advise on any further developments with the Caribou cooler.  Up date: I contacted Camco customer service by phone, talked with a real person about the air pockets that developed in my cooler. My overall experience was very good with Camco’s people. They were happy to replace my cooler for me on their dime. I since have received my new cooler and no problems with this one its top notch and I would recommend this cooler to anyone who thinking of getting one.bout the air pockets that developed in my cooler. My overall experience was very good with Camco’s people. They were happy to replace my cooler for me on their dime. I since have received my new cooler and no problems with this one its top notch and I would recommend this cooler to anyone who thinking of getting one. Up date:
B00WF92QGK|2|Very unhappy with this purchase! The transmitters and receivers they send out with this package will not even reach 38 feet! Be prepared to buy not one but TWO extended range transmitters if you want it to actually work. You would think for $419 you would get a working system out of the box and that's not even close. The extended range transmitters are between  $99 and $149 each. You will have to by two of them to get the unit to work!
B001JT0CGI|5|This is a good quality coax and was perfect for the 6 meter antenna that I use in a portable configuration. Overall a very good value and was delivered on time.<br />James Kidd
B004XNQLB2|5|Excellent tape
B002OW5J44|5|Great vent covers.  Easy to install.  Good directions.  The cover swings open for cleaning etc.  I got the smoke color because people said the opaque models made it too dark inside the rv.  Glad I did.  These are excellent units.
B001JT72NY|5|Worked fine, no issues
B00D9C2CDO|5|The best cargo carrier I've ever owned.  I've own about 5 carriers and everyone of them with the except of the Keeper and one other have leaked on the first trip.  The Keeper didn't leak or sweat inside with condensation.  I would recommend to anyone who needs some extra cargo space for a trip.  It very easy to install and pack and fold up for easy storage on the road or at home.
B008MM0CV0|4|I bought this to keep track of hours on a generator. As others noted, it is a loud making a &#34;tick, tick, tick&#34; sound. For my use it will be out by the generator, so the noise is not an issue. But if you plan use it inside, be aware the noise can be annoying. I gave it 4 stars because of the noise.
B000GV1AP2|5|The seat itself is amazing. Mustang truly is a great company that provides an exemplary product. The package however was damaged, and was missing the rear mounting bracket for my Honda Shadow Saber 1100. After re-checking the order I saw that it did not come directly from the Mustang company, and as such was not a fault of theirs.<br /><br />I called Mustang's parts deparment and explained the situation to their representative. I fully intended to buy a rear mounting bracket out of pocket and be done with the situation.To Mustang's great credit they shipped me the rear mounting bracket free of charge, even though it was bought through a 3rd party. I will, without question, upgrade my next motorcycle's seat and saddle bags to those of mustang's design.<br /><br />Also, the wife also is pleased with the added comfort of the seat. It allows us to go on much longer rides without the normal stiffness associated with riding.
B00NTCBN1G|5|Perfect
B00QXOE3BY|3|Not fit on my car
B0060D6UHI|5|Perfect for mixing epoxy
B0012Q4IPY|5|good price, great packaging,prompt shipping, O.E.M. equipment for Toyota rated for 115,000 miles
B00DK1APUQ|5|GREAT
B00RD4D9AO|5|This was very easy to install. Took me about 25 minutes, the hardest part was torquing the bolts as I didn't have a longer extension. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B00CKML4CE|4|a little light duty but it does work
B00HTWJBAW|4|1/3 the cost of other plates and looks great.
B006N94HNS|1|Don't  waste your money
B00MA3VW2K|4|Parts were well made and fit perfect. The paint was good not perfect. Color is not exact and there were minor imperfections around some of the edges. One small tab used to connect the rear coweling was cracked. These are very minor and I would buy again especially because of the cost for entire set and came with heat shielding.
B00KBKOAGY|5|Bought it for my girlfriend to use. She loves it so much that she can now see outside her front window without the sun blocking her view.
B005ZGLGF2|5|Looks great in my wife car
B00OEZ6LPA|1|These are cheap knockoff caps. They fit my 2012 Jetta but are loose and rattle where as the stock ones are solid. from 10 feet away you probably wouldn't know the difference but up close it's obviously a much cheaper knockoff.
B00VGL7E5G|5|Great product and. Very fast delivery
B003NVFH10|4|Super simple to install, the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 was that I bought this product thinking that all WeatherTech items were made in the USA. My shades say &#34;made in Germany&#34; right on them. That's my mistake, though. The product works great.
B0009IQZPW|5|Good value
B00029XC1I|5|It's America, what's not to love?!?!
B004KEHEJ2|5|Arrived quick,  and did the job. Needs 3/4 or 19mm wrench (either fits fine). It did the job of holding the manifold apart enough for me to start the bolts, and run em down.<br /><br />I recommend you use the felpro gaskets with the little dog ears so you can drop them in with the bolts started. Right after you get each pair of bolts started drop the gaskets in right then, because after you have all 6 bolts in you probably won't be able to get the manifold back enough to slip your gaskets in.
B00164V5XK|5|this is one of the best items for the money and definitely would buy again!
B004IYEYF6|5|Great new tire and reasonably priced. thank you.
B005JU5VH8|5|Best wipers ever. Safety issue so don't skip on lesser products.
B005JU5WI6|5|I recently replaced my 2014 Kia Fortes stock wiper blades and after 2 months of research, price comparing & reviews i decided to settle on buying the Bosch Icon Series wiper blades. I had to purchase the Icon 28A & 13A and both seem to be well made, stay against the windshield @ all times. Cleans rain, bugs and most other things off easily. Since I've only had these wipers a month i can't comment on how long these last even though they supposedly last 40% longer then standard blades. Also i haven't used these during a typical Pennsylvania winter so I'll have to report back about how these do with freezing temps, ice, snow and road salt.
B00ARF6FB6|2|It didn't work with my 2011 Nissan sentra SE-R. The car ran rough, 'Check engine' light came back on few minutes after I reset it.
B00080QHMM|5|A nice ergnomically easy to use tool.
B001DCN1QY|5|Awesome fast delivery and great quality
B007NIX33S|5|As you can see from the picture, my mpg is alot higher with the K&N AirCharger. When I had the stock intake, I was seeing on average 14.7 mpg.  Now I'm sitting at 18.9. That picture was taken after a 100 mile drive at approximately 70 mpg.  It's a rather flat drive so I'm not sure what kind of mpg you would get on a road with hills.  Either way, it's alot better than what I was getting.
B008BC8G7S|5|So easy and fast to install on my 2006 Chevy. I'm not very handy at anything but I needed to get rid of the blind spot in traffic. A heavy duty product.  I was very happy, for once no complications.  Also arrived in 3 days no delivery cost.
B00TQ07IOQ|4|Very nice!  Great product for the price.  Have to find a way to keep them in place as the flooring in vinyl and they slip and slide.  Will try double sided tape.
B00F47Z2J8|5|Great product.  Direct fit.  Jeep wrangler fog hid bulbs
B00FOX5T6I|1|Your product did not fix my HID &#34;flicker&#34; as advertised.
B0015UCQHY|4|Purchased this antifreeze for a new inboard diesel boat engine since it was one of two recommended by the engine manufacturer.  The container indicates that the 50/50 premix will provide protection down to -34F.  Unfortunately the antifreeze requires a spectroscope / refractiscope to measure the freeze point of this antifreeze.  I was advised of this issue by a Havoline tech service representative.  I have tried several different standard (floating ball) antifreeze testers and they all yield a freeze point between 0 and -10 degrees F one a new sample of this coolant.  So instead of being able to use a $5 tester I ended up purchasing a $100 spectroscope.
B00JGJGIAC|5|decent price,all copper, and right gauge to provide loss free connections
B00SVYKC64|5|Perfect Fit.  Could not ask for a better looking mat.  More than I expected
B000EBK8K2|5|excellent quality
B00O3GNURM|3|It seems sturdy and it really fits the description. What I missed that it has no way to attach to anything. No  hooks, straps, hole etc.
B0024E70L2|5|works as advertised . able to run both a/c's on the splitter .
B000P72C90|5|Worked well with my 2005 Tacoma. Audible clicks when it comes into contact with the plugs makes it a cinch to work with. No issues, would recommend.
B000CP2HOU|5|Very nice!!
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Took it to the beach with us and it held up well - easy to fold back up and swipe off sand. About 4 of us fit on it comfortably.
B00BCVPVGY|5|great price got here 2 days early will repurchase again
B002TJSS2C|3|The SMALL is REALLY really small...the weight range just isn't right by any stretch. Small is about right for an 8 year old.
B011PR4PIY|1|I would buy that if it said this kid supports Lyme disease awareness.
B003S8DZ3U|4|Key needs to be cut by a locksmith because it has a chip. Other than that it works great
B007KXIIBS|5|Looks great and easy to install.
B00WFHHUKE|1|I installed 1/2 these on a 2015 Subaru Legacy. Note - these will fit in the front blinker housing, but WILL NOT fit in the rear blinker housing. Also displeased with how hot they get, I've used resistors several times before... After just 1 minute these resistors are incredibly hot and I think are a fire hazard.
B000W0PMRE|5|Nice an thick, but still flexible.
B005R4L0SU|2|Good looking tail lights but I returned them because it didn't come with a connector and I didn't feel like hard wiring them into the existing
B00OO87SEU|5|It met my needs.Very pleased.The item came faster than expected.
B003WRA90O|5|Perfect for my 2013 f250 xlt. This kit with a 2.5 leveling kit looks perfect. The truck no longer sags in the back and has a nice level rake.
B00YXLLMHC|5|Great assortment of fuses in a handy, snap-closing box.  Just be sure to get the exact kind you need for your vehicle, since there are so many kinds of fuses being used now.
B0049MX8N6|5|Fits perfectly for my 2015 equinox. Took few hours for installation. Occasional moments of frustration when gravity worked against me trying to screw on wash and nut onto bolt. Purchased so that can use my bike carrier. Perfect product.
B00P9R8PPG|5|love it ..but should have gotten the beige one...
B010ODE03K|5|did not take long to read the instructions and clear my air bag code.
B00C977WMG|5|A+++
B000VLHCAE|1|What an awful design. As another persons review said, the designer needs to have his ass kicked. This top fits terribly. As said, the rear of the bed on the Ram is narrower then the front, but the bestop is the same width all the way back. So It barely has anything to hold on to up front. Now, the back and side windows....... I seriously had the entire thing put together in less then an hour, until I got to the windows. It took 2 hours to get them on. The &#34;J&#34; hook system that holds the top of the windows is pure garbage. I fear this thing is going to come apart at highway speeds. If you push on the window slightly, you can feel it come undone at the top. The top is also about 1 1/2&#34; taller then the cab of the truck, AND the gap between very top of the cab and the top of the bestop is almost 6&#34;. It just looks stupid. I bought this so that I could take my dogs around because they are too big and get hair and drool all over the inside of the truck. I think it will work for this, although I worry about those windows popping off . The ONLY saving grace is that I can fold it down easily. Its getting it back up and getting those windows in that I dread the thought of.
B0058OPTE0|5|Love these seat covers and have bought more.  They fit good for bucket seats.
B00GJMS4VK|4|Not great but better than what was in the jacket. You get what you pay for.
B001EOV45G|5|This is a great receiver/hitch cover.  Its heavy duty, fits perfect, and the secondary 4 pin plug holder on the retainer ring is a plus
B00JRE38EA|2|I will have to say they are a good bulb.  Not as good as the [[ASIN:B00JIEX722 JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright 5730 SMD 194 168 175 2825 W5W T10 LED Bulbs,Xenon White(Brightest T10 Bulb in the market)]].  That being said if you have plenty of room to install this bulb, then you should get this one.  I bought a pack of them because they were so cheap (cost wise).  I put them in the courtesy light in the door of an 06 odyssey.  Because there was plenty of room I was able to get it in.  I was not, however, able to put them into the door lights of my 06 sequoia.  I had to use the bulbs mentioned above.
B00SMQEEEW|5|Purchased this not too long ago and can't be anymore satisfied! It arrived on time. Excellent customer service and would definitely recommend this to anyone! So if your looking for an HID Conversion Kit, this one is it!!!
B008BA97WS|5|Excellent quality, easy install, looks great on my 2004 BMW E46 M3. Google the instructions and be brave. The lights are nice and bright, they look in credible and are a must on an E46.
B00I8SH50E|4|Very easy to instal and it sounds great
B0069YZYD4|5|This product is perfect for my crimson red tahoe.
B000GZAUQ8|5|Great price for factory plugs. Less than half of what the dealer wanted!
B002LWL3XI|5|Worked great and came with more than enough gaskets to do the job. I was able to fix my 97 Lesabre coolant issues.
B00BDBWRJW|5|I purchased this for my 2002 Saturn Vue after the driver mirror had been cracked for years. WHY DIDNT I BUY this earlier! Its PERFECT! So easy to put on. I know very little about cars, but I was able to detach the old one and replace it with this one myself in under 30 minutes. So easy and works like a factory replacement. I cant even tell a difference! If you need a new mirror, this is the one!
B00S8HCPEG|5|I bought this helmet (youth size large) for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it. I have zero complaints. She picked out the purple. It doesn't have as many vents as my HJC FS-15 but she's been comfortable riding on the back of my cruiser in city traffic on 80+ degree days. It's a DOT helmet but here's hoping we never have to see how well it holds up in a crash.
B00CYBPTKE|3|1 of 4 didn't work but they're cheap AF so I bought another pair so I have an extra JIC it breaks again
B0053RKWH6|5|Works as one would expect.
B003LF30HQ|3|Bigger than expected.
B0024E6ZW2|4|I'm sure this little unit will add years of life to our power steps.
B000EDSSMA|4|Unfortunately this universal range topper in no way fit our 95' 5th wheel which was a bummer but when pulling it out if the box it looked well made and great quality. I hope it fits for you.
B00HLYJBWG|5|I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it. He said it had a great hit. When I was messing with it before I gave it to him, it had a whistle sound when I sucked in air from using, but he had no issues with it, when taking an actual hit.
B001KW00NY|5|Work's  great
B00D44TMDA|1|Do not buy it worked for a week an then gave out now they won't refund my money
B00OZYHOE2|5|Much better than glasses.  Very comfortable.
B00FALVU8A|5|This wax does work well, It is a little quicker than a past wax but I dont think it last as long.
B008Y9K0OU|4|Fit my 2000 f 150 this is knob #2 last one lasted 3 years so cheap made but looks the same as factory knob did.
B006WPQNB2|5|Been using this full time in my RV since I purchased it a few months back.<br />This is by far the BEST portable toilet ever made. Everything from it's comfort to its functionality. This includes dumping the tank too!<br />Of note, you CAN sit right on the lid. Never mind the fact that it is thin. Your weight will transfer directly to the seat part through it. That said, do NOT kneel on it, or do anything that would put the weight in the middle rather than crossing over the edges. The lid would likely break from that.<br />The included chemical works great too! I received the green Thetford &#34;EcoSmart&#34; chemical with my toilet. In the past they have shipped their fruit smelling orange chemical. I just ran out of the original trial bottle, and I will now go purchase more. I am avoiding ever using the gnarly blue kind as I hate to damage the environment.
B000CHNL1G|5|I needed the exhaust hangers for one of my two cars.  It was easy to install and I liked the fact the part was available and a great price.
B00G4SCB90|1|These Coilovers are awful. The front spring is twice as long as it should be, making them nearly unadjustable in terms of rebound. Because of this, the ride quality is awful. I cannot wait to get these off my car.
B000DINKPQ|4|I liked it
B0026121YE|5|no issues what so ever. This was  a perfect  replacment for the one I had that was scratched. Good idea to replace these at least once a year.
B00BVQ5XFO|5|works great
B000A8JNF0|3|Can't say I've seen any difference before of after applying it.
B00C2CFE50|3|The tray is not that deep and if you are shoddy at ashing then don't buy this its not going to make you a happy camper. The lid does not stay secured for easy moving but it makes a great table ashtray. If this is the look you want by all means go for it. I have had no problems with the spinner or the catch. Personally I like it but figured people needed to be warned before buying this product.
B000BZII30|4|First one arrived defective, Spindle was stuck and was hard to turn, blew my new belt. Second worked fine, no problems after 10K miles. Coupled with a solar panel keeps my battery at 100% at all times. Check it before you install it, I gave too much credit to the brand.
B00XPL88NC|4|I have not tried this gage as of today.  It should work well on my motorcycle.
B00OLVG29W|5|easy to install; looks great; nothing but compliments
B00J62U7PQ|5|Could not expect better service!!!!!!!!Look good too!!!!!Excellent quality fit was perfect above and beyond expectations!!!!!!!!
B00877SL2M|4|works
B0009A0IMQ|5|So very easy to use, and made my BMW feel smooth as silk and the water just beads up. It has been a hot summer, so we shall see how it performs in the winter and rain. Easy to apply and take off- seemed almost too easy, but so far it has been great. Keeping it in the fridge is not a big deal.
B005C5EED2|5|Can easily carry more than what is expected naturally. Get a 10mm socket wrench or regular wrench and your good to go. They have the extra bolts you would need to replace the shorter bolts.
B003K2IFQG|4|Fit great on a early 2003 bugeye impreza wrx.  Will also work with those who have done the &#34;H-6 rear&#34; swap (bracket and rotor).<br /><br />Perfectly fine for street use.
B001G8AIMU|2|It does not charge battery anymore after 3 charges.
B00HJ6OBUI|4|Small than expected, the measurements are provided.  There are better cutting  boards available for the price on Amazon.  Do your homework.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent product. Far superior to other sunshades, especially for the price.
B001NZQIDE|5|Great fit on a 1999 F-350.  The plug under the dash will not be easy to access, lots of stuff in the way and sharp edges.  But much easier to plug this in than to cut into and splice the wiring.  Well worth the money to keep things factory and clean and save yourself a lot of work.
B000C59M98|5|Gave my car such a better ride
B008G431I0|3|It has an ugly trademark on the other side. I kept it as it was what I was looking for.
B00029JC5S|5|Perfect
B007IVS93Y|1|Shorted out fuses. Only work up and left on both sides.
B00029JXNE|5|Larger than expected but my fault for not fully reviewing specs.  Works as intended
B00CXYVKKA|5|I purchased this for my daughter and grandson who is obsessed with dinosaurs.  It is different than the other stickers, funny without being offensive.
B007XB3OKC|5|Very good price excellent fit
B004O844EM|5|easy to install and showed up in a timely manner. Got it for the old man for fathers day and he likes it a lot.
B005JU5VH8|4|One of the best you can by, easy on
B00B5ZMQDI|4|Love this product
B00VVSBDL0|5|like it
B001HLFWXQ|5|great product!
B009Y7MJVS|5|Finally found an ezpass holder that doesnt move around and fall off.  Fits the pass snuggly which others didnt.
B00RD982MO|4|Works pretty well
B00PNRDOJ4|4|We purchased these rails so that we could use a luggage bag on the top of our car.  We have side rails, but no cross rails.  These rails are easy to install, and being able to lock them in place is a bonus.  Our only complaint is that when the luggage bag was not on top of the car, there was an extremely annoying high-pitched hum.  We tried moving the front rail to the back, and tried raising the sun roof to try to deflect the airflow.  We finally removed the rails completely, and will only put them on when we will be using them to transport something.
B0009FB7JY|5|Worked well with my trailer hitch.
B009NQ8JLE|5|shocking but tis item for the price was great fit perfect.
B0022ZX9UY|5|Quality product. Used all in 2-1 competition series. Perfect amount.
B00ZB8P3JO|5|just as advertised.  no complaints at all.
B00S68U8GO|5|good
B00HDBUSYW|5|Got them for my son for his 18th birthday.  He loves them they look great!
B0006IX7W4|5|Thank you very much . My order was correct 😀
B007XY9YGC|1|Unit was not complete; no parts kit for installation; unit was not painted; no instructions for installation.  Unit was returned.  Ordered from another vendor and everything was in the kit including personal discussion for instructions.<br /><br />Very dissatisfied customer,<br /><br />Sincerely Jimmy R. Ramsey
B000E2ARGG|5|worked well
B00T2GT9L4|5|great product, it works.. it jump started my car with no problem
B000C9ACW0|5|Exact fit. Fast shipping. Very pleased!
B0073MFZ8A|4|It fits
B000GU0FIG|5|Perfect fit.The extra chrome caps was a plus
B00UHVUYYO|5|Great buy awesome quality and customer service Will be recommending this set up to everybody put it on my can am maverick XDs turbo
B00GYHTZ9K|5|Easy to order, received the right product, and performs well, very happy!
B0095XJW8Y|4|Smells AMAZING. Wish the small stuck around longer though. It lasts a few weeks - def under a month.
B006GFLI0O|4|great beanie. one thing i dont like it's that it leaves marks on your forehead.. besides that im really happy using that on for motorcycle rides
B00P7QIFQ8|3|it needs a better design and grip. my sunglasses keeps falling off
B000EQOIW6|1|I bought this item to replace the front engine mount on a 2000 Dodge Status SE w/a 2.4L. Despite the manufacture's claims, this mount did not fit my vehicle. After receiving my original mount and a replacement mount both were returned. The first issue I came across was misplaced drill holes. As a result, the mount did not align with the bolt holes in the car's supportive framing. The second issue I came across was also related to the misplaced drill holes. Due to the misplaced drill holes, one of the bolts would not fully screw into the car's frame leaving the mount dangling. As a result, I have given this mount low marks.
B00J5SP6VG|5|Works exactly as needed.
B00MN6MVJW|1|Bulbs Too big for 08 Harley sportster. Back one broke on first wheel rotation.
B004GDFCUK|5|very good
B008F91ME6|5|Works well on our fishing boat and very happy with the quality!  Also made in the USA which is a HUGE bonus!!!!  Happy to support American made products!  Excellent quality!!!
B005JEGDH6|1|They don't have the blue fade in them like my previous purchase of jtech. It's more of a greenish white
B00K24LQ7U|5|This is a very good filter.
B0089LSMSE|5|Can go wrong with OEM.
B001GR09S4|5|I installed the zinc anode drain plug to help prevent electrolysis in aluminum radiators.<br />Only time will tell if the product does the job, which scientifically it should.
B00KTI0C56|5|quick delivery, great instructions. very pleased with purchase. Excellent seller!!!!!
B00EYJU6ZC|2|These did not fit or stick well and they are not real Mopar. I ended up having to buy new ones that were real Genuine OEM Mopar parts. Beware real Genuine OEM Mopar will have consistent coloring and will cost a lot more than these did. I guess I got what I paid for.
B0044FQSY4|5|Worked great
B00DHGPVKI|5|An excellent charger.
B0081S95XG|5|Thanks for s good product
B00GSAUHB8|5|fit my mazda 3 2008 pretty great! and with a free gift? how cool.
B006WZOVHA|5|Excellent works as described
B00N535UO0|5|My Mercedes has never been more happy. This is a well built cover that should last many years. Nice color and fits the E350 perfectly. Would buy again.
B0020LQO1Q|3|does as expected.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Works great and is a perfect size.  Teenage daughter loves it.
B0031XULF2|5|Works Great
B00VAIDWDS|5|Good. Nice.
B00DQHECRQ|1|Would not stick. Got a refund.
B005H53DDO|5|Just what I needed , really good stuff !
B00BAZC6JM|1|One was broken and the other on burned out after 2 weeks. The cost of these bulbs at dealer is very high, found out that with our Buick Enclave that the fender has to be removed to change the bulb. My mechanic tried to change it but we ended up going to garage (dealer) anyway. If we had it to do over, we would go to the dealer right off the bat. It ends up the front end is off the car to change the bulb so when the cheap bulb burned out after 2 weeks, we had to go back and pay for all the labor and the bulb again. They normally change both bulbs at the same time because of the cost of labor and they are both exposed after the front end is off the car. Trust me, my mechanic can do about anything and I still say Pay the garage to do the work and supply the bulb, if you have the Enclave, it is the best solution to the process.
B00IYCHRCK|5|ok
B00YUZDRPG|1|Broke within two weeks....
B00X7HS5LY|4|I recently started taking my car to park and ride, to save up on rush hour traffic. By the afternoon, my car would get pretty hot standing there in open parking, and Texas weather is not very friendly in summers. I'm talking about 100+ here.    Sitting in car in afternoon was like sitting in furnace. I finally decided to give car sunshade a try.    Here are my observations:    1) I liked that it packs into a compact cover, so doesn't take much of space in car. You can put it at storage on car-windows, or in back seat pocket..anywhere.    2) the sunshade Jumbo II is huge. I have sedan, and it was big for that. That does NOT mean it didn't fit my car. the two rings in shade has gap between them. I can use that gap to narrow down the width.,However, with these measurements, i could use the same size on SUV too.    3) Using it was pretty easy. Just open it up and lay it against your front windows for sun protection. Now thats where i feel they missed something as It doesn't have anything to stick to your window. So basically, you have to use driver and passenger seat sun-guards to hold this in position.    Conclusion: Now coming to my original problem, did it make any difference? It DID!! I wouldn't say my car was cool like Christmas snow, since it still has three sides without shade, but i could feel it was some degrees less hotter than before. My steering and car seat were not as hot to touch and i didn't have to wait long time for my car to cool down.    Overall, its a decent compact product, which will serve its purpose i.e keep you car some degrees cooler.    **(...) I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users.

B00FJIT9BO|5|Some of the best stuff I ever used!!  Long lasting too!!
B00CLXNJNE|1|Junk don't waste your money had them both break within a week contacted seller no response bad product even worse customer service
B0051UPKZ4|3|Didn't need it after all.
B00TRF4H7Q|5|Works Great!
B000EEU0IO|2|They worked fine at first, but then the nylon line started breaking after two months of use and I had beads all over my car. Save your money!
B00IK4CTZW|3|These work, but are WAY to strong. Makes it hard to close the trunk, definitely a trying task of you have groceries in your hand.
B00AHJZBCG|1|Stopped working after a month. Would never charge after the first charge!
B007M0KMAO|5|Thanks!
B00080QHMM|5|Works great
B0027XYKZO|5|Heavy duty gaskets, great quality and even more robust than the OEM option!  Easy installation. Kit even comes with egr gaskets in case your application uses them so no need to order extra parts. There is a reason felpro is one of the top name in gaskets.
B0074EJ5C4|1|Tore at the seam as i was putting it on...
B00T9KOSQ4|4|Works Great
B00ASHP5G4|5|Best deal there is for shrink ttube.
B00H7N6OHG|3|could have been brighter
B0015RHHBM|4|exact replacement for my 1999 oldsmobile 88. The old mount had torn and was causing serious alignment problems. after changing out the old mount with this one I no longer feel slack when accelerating. If your vehicle is 10 years+, changing your engine mounts out will make a very large noticeable difference in your vehicles performance
B000EVYGZA|5|Innova-tive idea. Works great and it's a current model. I can't say I'm shocked.
B003CSPITU|5|Just what I wanted only less expensive
B0068N031Y|5|Perfect fit for 2004 E46 M3
B00W6IYUMS|5|Received product on time,only bad thing to say is that there was no instructions w/product.
B004X4B8DC|5|Makes draining oil easy with out the mess
B0131W4F90|5|Great decals. Easy to install and adds that little superhero touch to your vehicle or whatever else you like to put stickers on.
B0028JPEFM|5|Bought this to go under a sandbag dash mount for my GPS that had completely lost its ability to stay still on the dash of my car. It works beautifully (I had to remove the frame for the bag to fit properly) and I have no more issues. So glad I purchased this little mat.
B00B9F2OEA|5|Fits exactly like OEM, great buy
B0051UH656|5|So far works great on my ls swap
B00APN8V44|5|Not to hard to install and rides great. So happy to not have air junk anymore.
B00K1N43R2|1|Sorry the item is not as describeed. It is poor
B005BNZHTA|5|GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE, USED AS A SPARE.
B004ZF3FSU|5|Product is of good quality could be packaged neater but who cares as long as its a good product quality seems good the light output is amazing. I did have to do some minor adjusting on my vehicle to make the lights work as they should. i bought the 9007 8000k kit. Well worth it! I also paid the $30.00 for one day shipping and got it the day it was promised!
B0002V9IFU|5|It feels like it really conditions the leather.
B00HLV1ETW|5|For the price, this helmet is very comfortable, light-weight, and just a clean, simple design.
B00TS9ZW3Y|5|But cap was a little lose..........  Leaking a little....  Will buy again
B00K8DAIUQ|5|Great product!
B000CPCC4U|5|Perfect fit and a great way to ensure long bearing life
B00BSO3JK0|4|Great replacement for the melted and falling-apart factory key. But the back piece did not snap on all the way once the battery was in. The battery slot must not have been made evenly. The front part fit well with the factory back so all worked out.
B00HD9VRC6|1|The mirror is bad, car looks wavy.
B003ILGY7G|5|awesome
B001GBFI0O|5|Great price !!!
B000Q7HBA4|1|Sounds like my stock muffler so i took it off n ran straight pipes sounds way better this muffler s only good for American muscle cars in general
B00IVXL2NC|5|This durable timeless classic is a true symbol !! These are very high-quality, perform beyond all expectations, work of transcendent art, stickers !!! Dimensions given are accurate. The colors remain strong and bright and the &#34;metal&#34; remains shiny and reflective, even after several years!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!
B000NKCIKM|5|Running this brand since 2007 air and oil filters.no complaints no problems just performance ever since i started using kandn.
B00H3VMY0I|5|Shocks fit great.  The ride produced is as good as the OEM shocks.
B003CK8W7S|4|Fits as advertised. Instructions were clear and easy to understand.Ground off a few sharp corners, repainted to match jeep color, painted covers to match.Looks great and works even better!
B00ZPBQEZE|5|Excellent trim tools for the money. Plenty strong to tackle probably all your automotive trims needs. Using these tools properly should result in zero damage to any interior trim job.
B009DK1GIS|4|Fit perfectly, just needs painting.
B000XRHRZQ|5|Fast delivery. Great product for the price. Easy to install.
B0045I8V8G|5|I had trouble finding a cleaner for the cloth interior for my car. Well this stuff is great. There's not stupid stiff bristles and foam to rub into the car surfaces, just give it a little bit of elbow grease with a good towel and it does wonders
B0043RX8DC|5|Excellent quality. Well made. Looks AWESOME on the Vette! Very happy with this frame. Its top quality and really looks classy on the car!
B00HD68HU4|5|Works great recommended. ..
B000C5HXLM|5|ok
B00LC06RWM|5|Great value for the money.  I used these to install courtesy lights in aftermarket tow mirrors.  They are much brighter then the stock lights in the old mirrors and have held up well so far to outdoor conditions.
B007ZG7O2Y|1|Very disappointed with my purchase. My product did not come with any screws or a wrench for them at all.
B000CFSBI6|3|hard to install. It would not stay in place in old housing. but work good when done.
B00VJBIYNY|5|good product at a good price
B000HACYNY|5|crazy I need this in texas for just 4 weeks.
B002BHWZFI|3|Can't really say much for the anti fog claims (at least in my experience so far on a few pairs of sunglasses), but as a general cleaner, it's ok.
B004ZF4MW8|1|The lights work half the time
B000JFJLP6|4|Wow!  Loads of power for jumping and holds its charge for a long time.  The battery check feature is nice also.  I got this one after a wrecker used it to jump my car and he said &#34;it was the best one he's ever had&#34;.  I think he's right.  Have used multiple times on single charge.
B001JT0CGI|5|As advertised, shipping was fast, easy hook up to a proper antenna and CB.  Cable is thinner then it looks on the picture but you can sort that out with the eye if you have a sense of how big the PL-259 connectors are.
B00029WSWW|5|A really nice add-on to your vehicle if it didn't come with a compass/thermometer. Works well and fairly easy to install.
B00FEQRPB2|5|Perfect fit for my Town and Country.
B003BZD08U|4|Better than the plastic junk out there
B001V8RYTA|5|Very nice!
B007Y87UYK|5|awesome and good price! 1/2 of auto parts store!
B000RFSARI|5|This device allow me to clean out my RV sewer hose without spilling anything on the ground.  The connection to the hose fitting is secure and easy to use, and the cleaning is effective.  I use it every time I dump the tanks on my RV.
B000C2YDG8|4|works as expected keeps my 2003 Ford Focus running in time recommend to any Ford Z tech owner
B00M9IJZZ2|5|PERFECT<br /> I have a very tinted back window and the cling film window student driver sticker was really not visible from the outside, so I bought these two and I love them. Easy to use and they work. I noticed that cars behind us keep more distance and show a lot of patience, but best of all it amuses them and we got a lot of nice comments and thumbs up. One mom at my son's school has already asked to buy them as soon as I don't need them any more.
B00KTI7DZS|5|3 minutes after opening the package I had this programmed for my Suburban. Can't beat that.  I'm very happy with this purchase after the dealer told me it was over $100 for the replacement...
B004GCF1CK|5|This fit my 2005 Mazda Tribute just fine. looks GREAT. PLEASE NOTE The only that the original part had a very small rounded indent (where the mazda logo is on the front of the car), this one does NOT have it. HOWEVER, I like the solid lines on this replacement one better. So WIN WIN.
B004BHZR1A|5|Plastic, thought I would note that for those that want a metal emblem, although I do not care because it is shiny and I like shiny things. It is the ideal small car emblem for those that want a decepticon car emblem. It also matches the picture provided exactly and is the older decepticon metal emblem. Honestly nice investment to get many &#34;oohs&#34; and &#34;ahhs&#34;<br /><br />And of course decepticons are way cooler than autobots.
B0056K5XSI|5|Excellent quality!  Worked nicely for my cold air intake on my altima.. Looks great too.
B00CZBQCR2|5|installed to rear door lock wires of nissan titan and with a little rigging I now have a tool box and tailgate that lock with the factory fob! sturdy product and works every time!
B00VL9JFWI|5|excellent
B00ANA3UTK|5|This is a good cleaner. There are a lot of cleaners out there that will do as good of job or better but I prefer this becuase I know it wont stain or hurt any of the surfaces I have to use it on for my vehicles.
B00GS9ENAK|5|Everything went perfect
B00OQS8GC6|5|awesome
B0024NWX4C|5|The price for one headlight was $110 in a local auto store.  Amazon was $68 total for both headlights.  Easy installation and they work great.  Makes my old grand am look much newer.  The only negatives were A.)One of the bulbs was not working but no big deal because I had an extra one and B.) I wished I'd done this sooner.
B0009IQXCC|5|good job for me
B00B1ZJAFO|5|Cleaning a motorcycle chain is now a breeze.
B0013FU7HC|5|The part was what I needed. It serves it purpose as it keeps my power trunk pull down function.  It is nice to still find GM parts that are still needed for older model  GM cars. Replacement was easy as well.
B005PNSKSG|5|The cover fits very well and looks great!
B004R305QU|5|Heavy duty yes it is wow what a fantastic price .

B00WYAQFE4|5|Cool hat.
B00S5ZXC7A|5|Synced with my iPhone 4 without problem.  Showed engine performance information easily.  Have not had any check engine messages, so can't comment on that aspect.
B000WJ75J8|5|Quality product that fits and performs as expected.
B00Z6KM7VY|5|AS EXPECTED
B000IYPQUM|4|Works great. Fit perfectly in my 97 Accord.
B00UXSEL18|5|Well finished product good top notch quality👍🏻
B004GDMO9W|5|Great clean product! Looks very good! Fast shipping!

B00029WYBM|5|Worked out to protection
B002ERE0VW|5|Does a wonderful job!
B00T8M9N40|5|Will look great on.
B006QME5XE|5|Perfect fit and very easy to install on my 2015 Impreza Sport Premium.
B00V7GHVL2|5|Pretty good lift kit. I installed it myself in the drive way. It toke me about 5-6 hrs because I couldn't stop my ball joint from spinning while I losend the castle nut. Finally after reading an Internet post I put the tire on sat the weight back down on the tire and I could get the nut lose after that it was smooth sailing. My ride is slightly bumper but not to bad. I am pleased with this kit.
B00NEL6HK4|5|Can't beat the price for what you get
B008QBUDZM|2|Very difficult to put on. I bought a green one 5 years ago and decided to switch the colors up. This one snapped while I was trying to put it on. A shame, because I like the way these feel, and it improves grip on the steering wheel.
B004HEBN1A|2|Count on it being dented, scratched and needing paint. Nice rack but packaging is terrible. Start by attaching the wind deflector to the rack first, this will get you past the misaligned holes. The rest is pretty simple after that. Not bad for the money, just be ready to work on it to make it right.
B0002JM69W|5|work great!
B001W9OP86|5|These seat covers do the job I need them to do and they are very easy to put on and take off to wash.
B001NIGH4G|5|Just awesome, no complaints here.
B0013Q27CE|5|Seems very durable.  Already used on a recent camper caravan trip.  Other camper didn't have a tire iron...this one saved the day!
B007K294DA|5|The look I wanted, easy to install. Some reviews said it came with bulbs, mine did not...not that it matters because I just used the old bulbs.  Just wanted to make a note about it just in case someone was expecting it with bulbs included.
B00EJ3B7YC|5|This plate looks great on our Black/Silver Tahoe! Great product! Go Bucks!
B009FNX9B0|5|Very nice!  Husband installed in less than an hour.  We love them.
B00DHGPVKI|5|handy to have for maintaining my battery on my classic when I don't rive it as much.
B008PLL24E|4|It sticks, it stays, it's a mustache as advertised. Vinyl decal as described.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Hubby installed these on the back of our Travel trailer and they are much heavier and better than what came on it!  We were on our way to MD Anderson for my Cancer treatments and a piece of 18 wheeler tire slung up and bent one of our back ones.  It was not unusable but we wanted to make sure it was fixed properly so we just replace both back ones.  Oh yes...you do get the extra handle but we don't use those anyway....I just considered it a bonus!  I would Highly recommend these as replacements!  They are built with quality!
B00CIJ3T1S|1|Horrible item
B000C02TG6|5|Great set, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS. They look similar to the OEM parts and assembly work is seamless. I used them when installing the StopTech Brake Rotor and Pads. The old hardware might have still been usable, but for a small fee it gives you the peace of mind.
B00JU3QPIO|4|Good quality metal and good size. My only issue is that they aren't contoured so they don't stick all the way on.
B00CTM5IVS|5|Good
B000182EXW|5|As always, these fit perfectly. I bought a cheeper brand from another seller on Amazon for a different vehicle, and I have to say that these are well worth the extra few dollars. These go on easy, and are very well made. They make my truck look really sharp
B00XNEPYOC|5|great product!
B00CX7KXLE|4|These turn signals worked exactly as expected and the look was just what I wanted.  Thicker gage wire would have earned a 5th star.  Be careful not to over tighten them or twist them once mounted as the mounting bolt will probably separate inside the rubber stand-off arm.
B004J0PQ74|4|Direct fit also came with fittings for auto trans.
B00LRMOODY|4|The feel and appearance of this item is very nice.  Easily installed.  I did note that the fit is odd around the push button for the pop out key.  I think it will fall into place over use, but right now seems a to not lay down smoothly over that button.
B00JFUJDFE|5|I will now be able use the outdoor stove and my BBQ off of one hook-up, on my pop-up trailer
B003ZIISJE|5|These lights are simply amazing it was quick switch and light up nicely clear view
B00CIZ3QG0|5|great fit for my 1998 ford escort
B00LUSWXCE|3|It doesn't completely stay as rigid as pictured, required some fiddling around which still didn't give quite the same coverage but it'll do.
B006L93EDY|5|looks great! Exactly as described.
B00IA5L2CM|5|Excellent carb- I bolted this on my 85 Camaro and with just an idle adjustment I was off and running again.  Very good product and I highly recommend
B00A3EK25Q|5|Filters out all &#34;chunks&#34; that could potentially clog a spray nozzle. I would buy these again.
B004I0JNYC|5|Exact fit. Can't get any better than that.
B00YWFRDJK|5|I absolutely love this helmet, the absolute perfect helmet for rain, it is exactly  what I wanted without  the expensive price
B00OQ8TUDK|5|Update:  I worked with Curt and got a replacement.  It fits perfectly and took 10 minutes to install.  I am happy with Curt's response in dealing with the issue so I am changing my review rating to 5 stars. Original review below: I ordered this for my 2015 Silverado 3500.  The holes do not line up correctly.  I tried to install it myself but could not align it.  I then paid a mechanic to install it and they informed me that it does not fit.
B00B5H7ZRS|4|Was a little difficult to install but works great
B005SI5ZTA|5|Went in easy and stop the car each time I tell it too.  Works for me at a great price.
B00838808A|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING
B0016533DO|5|Screw was easy to install. Makes it a lot easier to make fuel and air adjustment compared to the stock screw.
B006BZIGL8|5|Was exactly what I ordered and what I needed.
B0054YCW62|5|Did a super job our car topper was very secure.
B004O5IDHE|5|All parts are of good quality and assembly took a reasonable amount of time/effort.  Not too happy about the condition of the box, which was torn open a bit at one corner when delivered.  Thankfully no pieces were missing.  An adult mountain bike, a pre-teen and two kids bikes installed without problems.  The bikes are held by the wheels so sway from the bikes is minimal.  Long hook & loop (Velcro) straps are also included which I used to further secure the bike frames to the rack but do not really think they were necessary for the smaller bikes.  The rack is a bit heavy when fully assembled but I would expect this from a stout, safely engineered rack.  Overall, very satisfied thus far.<br /><br />Save $10 on a Karma Go WiFi hotspot! https://yourkarma.com/invite/arturo8933
B005UJTSBI|1|Didn't fit around bulb. I had to drill them out larger
B00LTLN04M|5|Great LED accent lighting kit. Really adds color and lighting to my motorcycle. Will be buying another kit for my wife's bike.
B0002MG5M8|5|I never knew if my fridge would run for 10 minutes or 10 hours before check light would turn on. New Dinosaur board was easy to install and so far fridge has been running great. Highly recommend this American built product.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great product. Ordered one after AAA started my  car battery with one. I've used it for my car, truck, riding mower. Holds a charge for about 4 months after ac charge up. I have ordered 3 more as gifts.
B0009H50WW|5|It cleans chore rims very well
B00C309SVW|5|Absolutely perfect fit, finish and quality!<br /><br />Mirrors arrived well packaged and complete with all hardware that will accommodate nearly any application... what a novel idea, right?<br /><br />My bike, 2000 V11 Moto Guzzi Sport. Zero issues with install.<br /><br />Usability?<br />Spot on! The ridding position of this bike has always presented issues with stock mirrors, it required lowering the head and lifting the elbow to obtain any view from behind.  The lower profile now provides a straight shot of vision without the extra effort.<br /><br />Looks?<br />Almost like they were designed for my model. In fact the design is almost subliminal in identifying the grim reaper sickle.<br /><br />Sooooo happy with my purchase, thank you Kapsco for a well made and great looking product.
B00379ABX2|5|a little small for this price
B007R4GKWY|5|Excellent!<br />Recipients were very pleased.
B0041TR892|5|Perfect fit, easy to install
B0127XSCC0|5|[[VIDEOID:ff8aa4b13e2285f3270db709ba674ca7]]This is exactly what I need. Easily installed and removed for emptying. Good quality and easy to use. This is a sturdy bag that can attach right onto the chair. Leak proof and very handy. This litter bag came with a garbage bag. This litter bag allows you to keep the car clean, east to put on any headrest and looks professional. The nets on the sides were an extra bonus and allow you to put a bottle water and hand sanitizer. This litter bag is very convenient.    I received this product at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review.
B000BPSW7C|5|Gave it to my friend who loves it.
B00SHZKNZC|5|Worked great on my 2005 expedition
B001UOLO28|5|I am very lazy when it comes to detailing my vehicle, when I do something extra to it, I don't want to have to doit every time I wash my vehicle.<br /> I have a lot of vinyl trim so I purchased this product after it was suggested to me and I have been very happy with the results, so has my husband.
B00T94V1QK|2|I return the product 2 times and all the plates were scratched. It said brand new but there were paint chips and scratch. Has a strong smell too.
B003EOVHKG|5|Great solution for carrying an oversized tire. I use this tire carrier to carry a 35&#34; nitto trail grappler on my 2013 wrangler.
B000BQKSPK|5|Only straps which don't require tying to prevent movement of loads
B013Y4S2RQ|5|As someone who delivers food for a living, this car mount has really helped me out a lot. It comes with 2 parts that combine together to form the mount you see in the photo. It's really simple to put together. no tools needed. You simply unscrew the knob on one end, put the other end with the ball inside it, and turn the knob tightly until it's secure. I really like this phone mount because of how simple the design is and how well it works. The base of the clamp lets you turn in a 360 degree angle; you can turn the clamp horizontally or vertically, it's up to you. The goose-neck adds even more flexibility to the car mount, so you can put the mount anywhere and still have a great angle to look at it.<br /><br />Do not let the fact that it has a suction cup discourage you from purchasing it. The suction cup is designed so well because it can stick to any surface you put it on. After you stick it onto a surface, you push down the lever on the base to get even more suction. I am very confident that it will never fall off any car surface that you put it on. If you're like me and know how hard it is to take suction cups off your wall or glass surfaces, then don't worry. This mount comes with a little slip on the bottom of the suction cup so you can just peel it off very easily.<br /><br />~~I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review~~
B006OSNUYU|5|I just received the helmet, and haven't worn it while riding yet. It fits well, the padding is generous - another reviewer complained the padding was very thin. I didn't have any problems with the chin strap as noted by another reviewer. I like the addition of a helper strap on the D-ring to assist in the connecting and disconnecting. Everything works well - the flip up face shield allows additional ventilation if opened slightly. I like the positive lock of the modular portion. The exterior finish is very near perfect, and I have no complaints. An excellent value. I highly recommend this helmet.
B00KTHZZ3Q|5|Works well so far. No problems fitting in ignition. Took to dealer to program and cut key... $42.95.  A lot better than paying $240+ for the fob and programming from the dealer!!!!!
B005CLPE76|5|WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD.
B000GU0IG0|5|I bought front and rear turn signal replacements for my 1990 Kawasaki Vulcan 750. They fit just like the originals and they're nice and bright! Recommended for anyone with the same bike or any Vulcans that use the same lights.
B00493UPL8|5|Worked perfectly
B00IEKNZVY|5|Everything is  working  good
B00PSPSC20|2|Didn't quite fit.  The width was fine but the length was a little too short to be able to lock it on my stock Toyota hitch receiver. If it had been about a centimeter longer it would have worked.  Instead I had to give it away and search for another lock.
B00BHHAJLK|5|good
B008VQ0TPQ|5|BE CAREFUL WITH THE BULBS!!!<br />I dropped mine and I had to replace it...took all the hype out of the assembly.<br />Looks so sexy on a black tj...<br />Just be careful. These things are WHITE; it's an opaque white too, not clear.
B00UBIMAV8|1|This is without a doubt the worst spray wax, I've ever used.<br />Just smears around. Took me 30 minutes and a package of brand<br />new micro fiber polishing cloths to get it off. Eventually I used an<br />old t-shirt to wipe this crap off. It would have been easier and faster to<br />use a real liquid wax.
B00511LJE4|2|1. Did not come with any attachment fittings.<br />2. Stick-tion.  When the meter is mounted with the face in the vertical plain...and all other angles too, the needle sticks.  A slight tap and you get another indication.  With an instrument that sensitive, any sticking is unacceptable.  But for the price...I guess it was worth checking out.  You get what you pay for.
B000EQFKCS|5|well pleased
B000COTG22|3|Sounds great except when towing. It's so loud you can't hear yourself think
B00BXMRP4I|4|Worked great but had to shop around like crazy just to find an adapter for r134a system.  Have to add oil when you get it but comes with the oil.
B00W8ADB1K|5|Great product!!! Works great!!! Great quality and the company takes pride in what they do!
B00NT9R4UI|4|Took some minor adjustments for it to fit, but then it works like a champ.
B000BRGAJ2|3|I followed instructions, to the letter, but the product did NOT deliver the promised 20-degree reduction in termperature.
B00BY2220O|1|Was happy with it used it several times per week as shower bench. My son broke his leg and was using it but it collapsed suddenly and he fell and hit his head in the shower. It came apart at the plastic edges. Now it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend not sturdy
B00H88EQCK|5|I was impressed with this product!!!
B001TJALQO|5|This is high quality clay lube. I enjoy using it. I have become a fan of Chemical Guys products.
B00B2YHFO2|4|Very bright, working great!!
B0095DP9GI|5|it fit great on my 95 gmc truck. looks AMAZING! easy to install.
B004UL824Q|5|It was as expected with timely delivery.
B004BL71JM|5|Great product!
B00KC7NQ0M|3|Very thin and lets light through.
B000JFNAMQ|5|Easy to use and accurate.
B00HRXNLIG|5|Worked like a charm. Replace the dead aux port in my 2009 Honda Civic.<br />If you want to see how easy it was to install, youtube: &#34;Replacing the Aux Input - 2009 Honda Civic&#34; :)
B00Y1HS6GS|5|These things work as good as the original ones.  The website instructions are easy to use.
B000QR6XJ4|2|The product is good, but the second can I bought would not dispense.
B001P2HMQM|3|Really they only just look good on the car....they don't really offer any real protection from the rain.  It's very hard to get the window to go down a just enough to stay under the vent.  The vents really need to be about an inch longer.
B008X02UR0|5|Can purchase the ENTIRE assembly for less than buying separate parts from the parts supply store that sells to all of the local auto machsnic garages.. Besides the fact that a complete units takes a only a portion of the time to install so its running the bills down a lot lower for labor costs. I guess if I was a big business man... I would not pass on the discounted parts prices to the customer and keep the original longer labor I would have to charge on top of the higher parts prices... It is a whole lot safer already having the spring compressed. I guess if I was dishonest i could really be charging prices occprdongly to the prices I have had to pay for all these years from the parts supply store and had barely any wiggle room to put profit on any parts when purchased from them. I would be rolling in doe!!! But just can't get myself to do it! I pass the awesome price and the reduced labor time right onto the customer!!
B000BNOI90|5|Its just as I expected it to be
B0002SREBI|5|Works great
B003XGYDE2|2|I should have been more wary when I saw the Bon-Aire brand name on this product - previously I had a plug-in compressor that died.  It was under warranty so I had it replaced.  That one died prematurely, too.  I received this &#34;Goodyear&#34; model as a gift and within a half year of light use (perhaps 6 total times from Christmas into the summer) it stopped working.  There were no warning signs that it was about to fail (I suppose the brand name should have be one).  This compressor was not abused.  It was never run for long periods of time as I primarily used it to top off the air pressure in the tires on my Prius.<br /><br />I have since discovered that a bike pump will perform that function more effectively and simply than an electric compressor so I'm going to switch my topping-off method to a much more reliable device that is also cordless (at least I think I'm cordless).<br /><br />The glaring negative aspects aside, I did like the screw-on connection to the tire stem.  I found I needed to pull the rubber grip all the way back to get a good grip for tightening it but with some practice I could minimize air loss when connecting/disconnecting it (screw it on without pushing it in until you start to hear air leaking then push it on as you finish tightening it).
B004HNT4WQ|5|Product as described.  No one has taken my Gator for joy rides since
B00KMBZAC0|5|These are really nice, but I'm not going to put them on my car lol I'm going to give it to a friend who needs them...
B00HBAG9AC|1|This product is indicated even if the measure has 10 new oil, unlike advertising. That should tell exchanges. Of course, with the oil used it may represent the 5000 mile test 10. Failure of equipment goods is a severe disappointment.
B0033WNJBO|5|The CURT Class III receiver Hitch for my 2011 Subaru Outback was a relatively painless install that I did in my driveway last week using some 8&#34; drive ramps, wheel chocks, a muffler clamp tool, some silicon spray (for loosening the muffler brackets), a nylon strap for tying the exhaust at a 6&#34; drop near the axle and a RotoZip for the 1/4 shank grinder bit.  After watching the excellent videos that are on YouTube by CURT, it took me almost 90 minutes from start to finish to complete this job.  The parts kit was complete and the key to success for this type of install  is to have the right tools.  The only modification required is enlarging two plug holes to pull the bolt assemblies through and that is easily accomplished with a compressor die grinder or what I used--a RotoZip tool that will give you between 20,000-30,000 rpm. Anything slower and you won't grind the metal in the hole--you'll just grind down your abrasive bit really quick. With the RotoZip, it took me maybe 3 minutes per hole to enlarge. Also, drill the other two bolt holes with a minimum 1/2&#34; bit.  The receiver hitch mounted smoothly and easy to hold up when you're on your back .  Make sure to torque the nuts to the specs with a heavy duty torque wrench/bar (110lbs) and then check it a couple of days later to make sure they're tight.  If you enlarge the plug holes to the same size as the hole inside the spare wheel well, you can pick up a couple of plugs that size and finish off your install.  Otherwise, cover them up with some radial tire patches secured with Gorilla tape.<br />Now I can mount my Bauer Bike rack, hook up a U-Haul trailer, or get that Zodiac boat I've been dreaming of.  Enjoy
B00UVNBPJ6|5|works very good.  easy to install.
B0007M30AI|5|just the right drop for my truck and good price
B003W1KL80|5|put second battery in 09 chevy 1500 trk very simple to install with this kit, great instructions ,  the best,
B003BSB7PU|4|I have a very sensitive sense of smell.  These worked great to keep our grey take smelling fresh especially when in storage between trips.
B00069CN2I|5|Paid this price for 1 at camping world. These fit great.
B00DJ8MZXU|5|Kid loves it !!
B0009IQZPW|5|Best product to use on your car
B000BZJ5D2|5|Best spark plug wires i've used so far, LOVE the way it clips right onto the spark plugs, very secure fit.
B001D20X4W|5|Filter appears to be of similar quality as the factory filter. It was easy to install (there is You Tube video explaining the exacat procedure). Better than paying the Honda Dealer $79 to replace. I recommend this filter.
B00CBNAARW|5|great.. good quality
B00GBBE6CA|5|Got as a present, perfect fit, perfect size.
B003HFTP2Y|5|I was not impressed when it first arrived and had second thoughts about keeping it ... but I've had it on my SLK for 2 weeks and have decided that it is really perfect for what I need and it is worth every penny. I keep the SLK under the porte cochere so it gets only a little sun on the rear (south) and driver (west) side for a few hours each sunny Texas day. A little water from blowing rain or the sprinkler system. Mostly it would get dusty. I washed and waxed the car and covered it. This cover is a perfect fit and actually included a sheath for the antenna already mounted. The material seems to only be a medium density single layer of treated silvery fabric. It is extremely light weight and very easy to cover and uncover the car. I have not needed to use the front or rear straps or the center cable. The elastic corners do a perfect job keeping it in place. I had roofers here the past 2 days and I uncovered the car to check it when they finished their job. The car is spotless clean, unscratched, and I'm hoping years of use will prove to protect my paint from UV damage.
B00G1YF068|5|I used these for back up lights on my 2012 GMC Denali.  They work really well and really light up the area behind the vehicle.
B00QMKYYYK|5|Great deal! I have gotten ripped off by local auto parts stores a lot buying these ($5 for a pack of just 5 or 10 fuses!) but NO MORE! Simply, they do the job. And now I have enough to last me for years! And that's saying something, considering I drive an 83 Jetta!
B00NGR3XOE|2|Very goopy and hard to work with. Has to be applied very quickly otherwise it starts to gum up.
B003BZD03K|3|Works as needed
B00C78GKHK|5|Nearly 1,000 miles logged with this jacket this summer, I wear it every time I get on the bike. Great summer protective jacket. Thankfully I haven't hit the ground in this yet, and can't comment about performance in the moment of need, but this is a very stylish, well made jacket, of very tough mesh, and high-quality embroidery and nylon for the reflective striping and &#34;Boulevard&#34; text. Removable rain insert is great as well. A lot of hooks and snaps involved to get it in/out, but solid and waterproof once in. Without the rain insert, the mesh allows for fantastic ventilation even on the hottest summer days - feels like I'm riding just in a T-shirt. Pads at elbows, shoulders, and back feel solid, substantial, and correctly placed, but not uncomfortable while wearing. I'm 5'10 and 210 pounds, barrel chested, and ordered the XXL, fits wonderfully - Stops right at my waist in front, padding overhangs a bit in back, and sleeves fall to halfway between my wrist and knuckles (I like longer sleeves). I'm usually an XL in jackets, but went one size up with good results.
B00KQXKG46|5|DAYLIGHT EXTENDER
B00ISAA7WK|5|Simple installation.  Looks and feels very solid.  2015 JKU.  Would highly recommend.
B0000AXNMO|1|I noticed that the shield became hydrophobic, but it is helpless due to the rain dispersed into very small droplets and still stick on the glass, which make it worse to see through. Want to remove it, but hard I know, because I guess it might be some silane coupling agent reacts with the silicon element in glass and hydroxyl groups on the glass surface. Maybe make it super hydrophobic performed not as good as to make it supper hydrophilic.
B0001EFSTI|5|As a person who works with his hands every day, this utility key is extremely useful.<br /><br />I've use the philips head in a pinch for something every week. The bottle opened is great. It actually stays very secure to my bustling keys.<br />I've test all the tools and of course the bottle opener. Everything is solid and what you'd expect from Swiss+Tech<br />The entire thing is lightweight and feels just like a key. My only concern is if I will be able to take this on a plane. Probably have to pack it in my luggage unfortunately!
B00J00X3NW|5|I use it for my riding lawnmower
B00NXFOKL4|1|The bulbs I received does not fit my E350 Mecedes, the pin configuration look right but the alignment key is on the opposite side of the socket not allowing you connect the bulb.
B00T9H5V1S|5|This light is amazing.  We've had it now for 6 months and it lights up the night sky like the 1st night we used it.  It's prefect for late evening and night boat rides.  I'm considering putting one on my Jeep.  The center spot light and outer flood lights are so bright you can see a 100 yards out.<br /><br />It's withheld bumping into trees, docks, and harsh weather.  Well worth the price.  I am enjoying my $85 light bar as much as the ones who paid $300+ for theirs!  Save the money, but 2 or 3...just try this light bar out.<br /><br />I'll post a picture for the proof as soon as I can.  Seeing is believing.
B00390VH96|4|Okay
B00DSCZ0U2|5|I installed these on the trunk of my 2001 slk230. It took about 60 seconds each and they work great. I'll let you know how they hold up.
B0009JKI5Y|5|Typical rain-x product...great
B004RCOWQ0|5|super fast shipping and exactly as described
B0072U6ULY|5|Easy assembly - must have for any pickup truck - looks and functions great
B0002JN2EU|5|I used STP and Lucas products in the past but recently switched to Sea Foam when my father-in-law told me that the motor pool in the university that he used to work at uses Seafoam in all 150 of their vehicles. He said it seemed to really help those vehicles and he uses it in his vehicle as well. I found it for $7.99 on Amazon and it was $11.99 at the local auto parts store (Advance).
B00A00IIJU|5|Perfect fit! Love the way they look.
B002OUMVWY|5|Fantastic. Better than I expected. Easy to hook up and works really well.
B00BYH6C1E|2|These did not fit in my car - a jaguar.  I thought they were supposed to fit in any car.  They are useless to me.
B008KZJVU2|5|The best
B0045K2Q9Y|5|good value for the price and have this stored in my truck - have already used some of the fuses (issues with power door locks)
B00WFHFG4G|5|I bought this for my elantra...the bulbs were 1156na but i purchased the t10s...another company had a adapter but it created the hyperflash problem...installed these within 10mins and they worked....flawless...<br /><br />Will purchase leds and etc. from this company....
B004AHOBBS|5|Great replacement for my 2011 Subaru WRX!
B00CQ7W1LQ|5|good price on just what I needed
B002HCAXR4|5|Noticed my car running a lot better! The old air filter was full of dirt, dust and rocks! I have a 2011 Subaru WRX and it fit perfectly!
B00T9N6DPK|5|Awesome quality, decent finish and looks great! Love it! I bought two for my trailers and hitches for other applications.
B000WJJGIQ|1|Products was not as shown.  Does not include squared spacer bolts.  Instead includes round spacers that will not fit smaller batteries.
B00P6OOTSY|1|Didn't fit on my 2010 528i BMW. These rotors are bigger from the middle.
B00KD3GZQC|5|Ordered this product, received in 3 days and 100% satisfied.  Very high quality. Will buy from then again when needed.
B00NNYYHFO|5|I have used this product for decades.  It's one strong cleaner / degreaser.  It's the only thing that cuts cooking grease from tile surrounding our outdoor grille.  (My wife seems to get more grease and oil around the grille than in it).  It cleans the grease off the grille, itself, as well.  However, it is a strong cleaner.  It will remove decals and other soft items.  It can even remove some paints if you're not careful (someone used it on their Toyota wheels and the paint came off... maybe it's designed to eat Toyota's....).<br /><br />I now know to spray it on the wash mitt rather than on the surfaces directly.  I flood the target item with water first, spray the mitt, then wash down the object.  In the case of the exterior tile, I just spray it directly on the tile.<br /><br />Try it on a small area and see how it behaves before you blast the entire thing.
B000BQSIWK|5|Very easy to use. Just connect cables to battery choose volts and type of battery. I really like the digital display. I have been using an old charge from the 80's with the bouncing needle gauge. Wow what a difference.  Plus the price can not be beat for this much quality. Hope this will last 30 years like my old sears charger did.
B00KRSWAIU|5|love it
B00BY2220O|3|OK but legs tend to bend when using as a seat.  I weigh 200 lbs.
B00ZDHCAS0|5|I was very hesitant to order this, because I thought that at the price....there is no way it works well.....but it is less than 1/6 of the asking price at my local dealership....and it works perfect every time!! Thank you so very much...I am planning on ordering a second one!!
B008YJM6QK|5|I have a ranger 2013 XP 900.  I had this originally glass rear window panel, yet broke it recently.  I do a lot of logging and was tossing some large pieces of wood...one hit the window and it shattered.  I will say it's very durable, as I had done this type of logging activity for the past year and many times hit the glass window...this time it finally gave and I'll be careful going forward.  I love the lock and ride system on the ranger, very easy to install.
B0027EUPFC|5|Very happy with new pump.was here on time very fast just in time to enjoy rest of summr.thank you.
B0002SR88C|5|If you have ever struggled and sworn at those cheap retractable (this is debatable btw) razor blade scrapers that you normally find in a hardware store, this it the scraper for you.  Holds the blade tight!  Plenty of scraping leverage from the handle. It also stores your extra blades in the handle as well.  Only down side is to remove blade after use and put in handle so you don't get cut accidently.
B00GJX1L6Y|5|perfect product easy installation and shipping was A+
B000E3VHWI|5|Excellent ! Helped turn an irritating beast into a tamed lamb.
B0099XHXBI|1|This part does not fit my GMC 2002 Envoy XL as it was listed it would. Now my car will be down 5 more days. and I have no way to contact anyone but by email, not happy.
B00OAOANYK|5|i like this
B000BOA0BY|5|Works great
B00QVP9KY0|5|To be honest I purchased this item not for sun or snow (or even rain in Portland Oregon!) but for sap.  As I told the Apex folks (great folks, btw, for support and customer appreciation!) I have spent nearly the entire summer frustrated with a fuzzy windshield due to tree sap (I like to call it spitting) sprinkling a pebble finish on the whole car while it sits in a park & ride parking lot each day.  The substance washes off easily enough with a carwash but do I want to wash my car daily to be able to see through the windshield?  I used gallons of windshield wash fluid to help but the windshield was fuzzy with the sap or smeared with the attempted cleaning.  I tried various products at home and might get the gunk off but never a nice clean windshield.  A weekly car wash was required but the first day back in the P&R...back to the problem.  I looked on Amazon for some kind of windshield cover.  This one had good reviews but I did see a few argue problems with the magnets not doing their job.  I can't swear if we had a 30 MPH wind I wouldn't see some problems but mine seems to work great and the magnets attach nicely to the car (and the covering protects my car from any scratching).  The first day I  came to my car to drive home, I took off the cover and sat down and felt &#34;startled&#34;.  I'd gotten so used to expecting a messed up view and washing my windshield off and on all the way home that I just sat and appreciated NOT having a mess on the windshield and all the way home NOT washing and smearing and feeling frustrated.  What a pleasure.  Definitely give this one 5 stars for resolving my problem with a messy windshield and poor visibility.  I am guessing when the leaves all start falling the sap problem will go away but I will appreciate not having leaves all over my windshield and in the well area where the wipers and wash reside.  And though we rarely get snow and ice in Portland...the cover will probably stay in the car for any days I feel a cover might bea nice thing...maybe every day for that rain (if it ever returns!).  A dry clean windshield every day sounds like a winner to me.  The cover is quick to apply and take off (never hurts to have speed when the bus is coming!).  Thanks, Amazon and Apex for solving my problem...easy and thoroughly.
B001TMEIZQ|5|I received the item promptly and was able to install it in about ten or fifteen minutes.  I am sure the dealer would have wanted at least a couple of hundred dollars or perhaps more to replace the unit.  I found a you tube entry that showed exactly how to remove and replace the unit.  All you have to do is unscrew two easily accessible screws to remove the air conditioning vent/cup holder unit, then another easily accessible 'star' head screw to unscrew to separate the two.  Replace the cup holder part, screw the star screw back in, slide it in the dash and screw the other two screws in and you are done.  Even if you have to go buy a star head screwdriver... still, compare  ten or fifteen minutes work and the cost of a screwdriver to the cost of paying the dealer to replace it.  You will still end up sitting around at the dealer waiting as well?<br />Do it!
B000C3RDGO|5|This replacement fit perfectly. All of the dimensions are the same, and the slide pins came pre-lubed. While I didn't need them, the pad clips were nice to have. The bleeder screw was somewhat bent, but no biggie - I just took the screw out of the old caliper. The old caliper was sticking/dragging terribly, and this one eliminated that problem. Great price, too.
B00I548SZW|4|These steps fit my 2014 RAM 1500 Quad Cab perfectly and only took about 45 minutes to install all by myself with just a socket set.  Looks good and feels sturdy.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Worked out of the box.
B0064GON5C|5|Great gps
B001SIFHUQ|5|they just look great period  and are very comfortable
B000WQOR4C|5|I'm very happy with the performance. Also installs well. It's easy to cut and the adhesive allows re positioning before it really bonds to the surface.
B000C9MQK6|5|Been doing a front end overhaul this summer on my 1999 oldsmobile 88 and these tie rods are on point quality wise. very noticeable driiving and steering difference after replacing these with the ACDelco professional outer tie rods.
B00R4YUT3I|5|Solid, compact.  Fit my needs and easy.  MADE IN US.
B003KK5O1W|5|lasted me a long time great product buy extra lining cushions though
B00LNIPAIU|5|Love the seat covers,but how do I get the free dash pads I couldn't get through,thank you
B000C2YCW8|4|Belt came in good condition and fit was right. No problems.
B00QCM6FJA|5|Good
B004EZLYMU|5|Works good
B00NJ43SSU|5|Excellent product...makes getting in easier especially if you have issues with knees.
B00A1A394S|5|Item worked flawlessly,great price,easy 2 bolt installation !!!!!!<br />Could be shipped with instructions
B00F0BSJVG|5|OK
B004I1F3AE|5|Arrived quickly, looks great, came with all the bulbs, easy to install, and works great so far. Will update when it's done some time on the road.
B008CLMG6K|5|works great!
B00ELR3Z7S|5|Works great and more than simple to install. Only need a small screwdriver to remove old supports and new supports just snap on.It takes about 5 minutes.
B004A09OAI|5|Works perfect.
B000BRMYN8|5|Great item
B00IZZDRR0|5|Excellent step.  Extremely sturdy.  Nice and wide.  Very well made with a no slip surface.
B0024NSLJ8|5|They look great and operate as advertised.  They were a breeze to install.  I have not aligned them as yet and think they may not need that much.  That said, I hope they don't fill up with water, stop working, and/or lose their coating.  I will write again if something goes wrong, but for right now I highly recommend these headlights.  They now have lasted through a couple of rainstorms and are still working fine.  Great purchase so far.  Let's see how the lens coating holds up.
B00KQSLBCW|5|fit right came fast, cant ask for more than that
B0017R5EHO|5|Great time saver!
B009Y7CZCG|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Impreza Sport Premium. Very easy to install and looks way better than the OEM clear protector. Just keep in mind this is hard plastic and not rubber-like at all.
B00NB585EE|5|Love them
B00D97TMXW|5|This kit is really easy to install, getting all plastic off the Ranger is the most tedious part.  Completely changed the drive of this Ranger, I absolutely recommend this kit.
B000C9WJ3A|5|Perfect fit!
B00BCNB3EQ|5|Good quality. Excellent quick transaction.
B0050NGB32|4|Great idea! No more lugging around lumber and probably much safer. As everyone else has noted, had to drill some holes in the bottom to allow water to drain.
B001KSG3MA|5|worked great!
B00435H0GA|5|Works well, and has not tore the side walls of my tires as one customer was fearing !! ??? !!!
B007NGAW3O|4|Nice leather and liner, zippered pockets on the outside and 2 good sized, snapped pockets on the inside.  I normally wear medium to large so I ordered the XL per previous reviews. The XL was a bit too big so I returned it and got a large, which fits perfectly. I would have rated 5 stars but I had to pay a return fee and the price went up between transactions so the great low price wasn't as great. I still recommend this vest. Very nice.
B003VLBPJA|5|great net for a motorcycle or atv etc.  great price for quality<br />a little trouble on shipping, but got here and is better than I thought it would be
B001O0FQE0|5|Perfect !, ... will work on Mag Donnelly mirrors.
B003L31RK0|5|Solid product.
B005BNZGCS|5|Works great
B0040DVL6U|5|this mirror is Excellent i can see all of my blind spots and more lol
B00VNDMH8G|5|They work perfectly
B00SK49JNM|1|I received my light in a timely manner. I installed it according to the instructions. However, the toggle switch does not illuminate the backlight. I have called and left several messages for them with no reply. My recommendation is that if the light works and you don't have any issues this would be a good light, but from what I've read, if you have an issue...good luck cause the support on this stinks.
B008SES016|3|I purchased these about 7 months and i just noticed the other day that they are already falling apart.<br />The passenger front mat is coming un-sewn around the edges.<br />Somewhat disappointed, I expected them to last longer than that.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Good little guage.
B000CMJ5UM|5|Sounds great, deep tone in the low end and barely any drone on the highway!
B00JQ4FMEU|5|There plastic but durrable. Fit perfectly on my 97 maxima's 16s
B0031I2SO4|5|definitely more heavy duty then standard
B000NCOKV0|5|great to have when you have more than one bike
B00K7VE2VK|5|No more water spots, no more hoses and no more suds all over.  From someone who loved spending hours washing and waxing cars ,,, what the heck have I been missing!! Should have found and used this stuff years ago!!!!!! I was totally shocked on how well this product worked I just followed the directions and my cars came out clean as could be with minimal water, the product , a spray bottle and a few towels. Cleans everything even the glass, mirror's and bumpers. Highly recommend to anyone else who wants a life on a nice sat afternoon.
B00OO87QYC|1|This key fob cover did not fit my Kia Soul key fob.  The holes made it hard to push the buttons, which are not round.  I was disappointed, but I did not pay much for it, so I'm not upset about it.
B00OALOCUE|1|I received only one decal not 2 I'm so disappointed
B004VRNCQM|5|Can't really smell anything
B000LG25Q0|5|Much cheaper than the dealer and works just as good
B00HR26X6O|5|Great product! Overly simple installation as well. Could not be happier with my purchase!
B0002UEMZ2|5|This should be next to duct tape in any tool/diy box.
B00514C0F8|5|adds an extra touch of chrome, very pleased.
B0002MBPY6|5|Fits very well and keeps the cargo area clean ...
B00PY1U8TI|4|All worked good except one that wasnt soldered correctly apparently but all others were good
B0049CNX36|5|Installs easily and very clean looking.
B000C9G34G|5|Perfect fit. Made my car run like new or close to it. :-)
B0002X520S|5|Works as advertised - especially on axe head sheaths
B006THWK06|5|Case is awesome!! Really neat product. Amazing price.
B00UBIMGSK|5|Great finish. Not a lot of white residue in the seams (only where i laid it on too thick).<br /><br />I had a hard time taking pictures, as the shine was messing with my light settings.
B0046GF3SS|5|It fit well and worked as advertised.
B000C6OJP4|5|Great filter that does the job like it is suppose too.  Removed my previous filter of the same brand and it was very dirty as I had not changed it in two years.  The new one took me five minutes to put in and my car is back up and running.  I saved over $50 by doing this myself as the dealer wanted to charge a whopping $60.
B004IYC5HU|1|Thanks, great price fast service
B00265BWK4|4|worked
B000J2ERSK|5|A+
B000GU3KHE|5|Fits my DR 200 SE very well. The price is right not sure how many seasons of the last but it seems like a very good deal.
B0045WBVUM|5|My wife read about this and suggested I get one for our 2015 Route 66 trip. Could not believe the difference it made on long days. Never bothered to strap it down as it stayed in place on my Kawasaki Mean Streak. When we stopped I merely stuffed it  behind the windshield.
B0009PCPNQ|5|this really cleans. I love it
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fit Ford Fusion 2007 pretty perfectly
B00DSR6B50|1|This is repulsive.
B004Q78GL8|4|Great Product
B00MP3B6SU|4|These are nice pads, but it's important to note that they won't fit on really thick crossbars like the stock ones on my Hummer H3. However, they fit nicely on my wife's RAV-4, so I'll keep them.
B00V2XHSSQ|5|I purchased the bar to put on the front of my 1997 peterbilt. I'm a hog hauler. I'm constantly driving down every 3 cow beaten path a tractor trailer has no business being on, trying to find some hog barn 3/4 mile into some corn field at 2a.m. this light bar has been an instrumental tool and can't believe I went without it as long as I did. Couldn't ask for a better product. A better desceiption. Or a better ship and arrival time. Thank you amazon. MATT GATLIFF
B00G0P0I60|5|Hardest part wast removing the old rubber seal .after it was out the replacement popped right it!
B000JUVCNU|4|Excellent results. Engine never ran smoother. Less than full 5 stars for poor instructions. The magnet is too tall so when the rotor is reinstalled on top the magnet, the rotor hits the inside top of the distributor cap. I had to go on the Internet to find many reports of this problem. The best solution was to grind 1/8&#34; off the bottom of the rotor. Then everything fit fine. Why isn't that in the instruction book?
B0000AXTUY|5|It works great.  I have this trickle charger on my boat, 3 SUVs, and a sedan, and never ran into a dead battery again, even after leaving the country for a while.  They install easily but I have not used the mounting bracket on any of the cars. I slide the unit between the battery and the chassis and run the (short) power cord to the headlights. When the car is not in use for a longer period of time, I run an extension cord to the car. and plug it in.  Easy.
B0000AY2Z6|5|Nice to read mail with this fan around on DC.
B004J325D4|5|Awesome rebuild kit, comes with everything you'll need. O-rings, springs, clips, needles, pilot screw, float valve, a #42 slow jet and a #138 main jet. All stock parts for Honda 350x keihin carburetor.
B001GJ3EJS|5|I really like these brushes and I couldn’t be happier with them.
B000P17NXQ|2|After some research it was said that this was the only brake controller that was compatible with my 2014 Dodge Ram because everything is networked in the truck. I purchased the adapter harness for my truck and followed the instructions.  As soon as I turned on my truck I got a check engine light and a electronics brake system error.  I removed the unit and I still couldn't get the errors to clear.  I had to take it to the dealer  to correct the problem.  The unit does seem of quality with some very nice options, it just did not work for my application.  Amazon was great giving me a refund.
B00DGEGH4A|5|Excellent product. Will buy again.
B00YOC99HU|5|My baby girl hates getting in her car seat and having the bright sun in her eyes. These screen shades are the perfect solution to make my daughter happy.<br /><br />The car shades are made very well. I love that they don't use suction cups because I never have to worry about them coming loose. These sun shades are easy to put on the window and they stay secure. Also, they are high quality and look great!<br /><br />I'm so happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these easy static cling car shades.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and un-biased review.
B00IUWM59O|5|Bought this to replace my original battery in 2001 Suzuki 600. Great price and great power notice a big difference start first try. About the same size and same weight fits well. Really like the LCD convenient to see what the vultures is and the days of use. Even seeing what your alternator is charging your battery at why using it. I would recommend buying the battery.
B003S6IDP2|5|I will do an update on this item if anything happens within the next year but I received the device, had it installed and it works great!
B0009V1WSE|5|This masterlock set worked exactly as expected! Kept my cargo hitch carrier safe as I traveled. It reassured me that no one would be stealing my hitchy carrier when we were at the beach and the car sat in the public parking lot. Such a nice product to have for any hitch needs.
B005M2ULYG|5|Looks great
B00RLUGWMW|1|Pads lasted less then 5000 miles in my 2013 F350  I am an ASE Master Tech BTW
B000RFUF12|5|WORKS GREAT
B001810SHA|5|Easy instruction and good price
B000EDSSDO|1|1 trip , no it didn't even make it 1 trip!!
B00NLRCRGY|1|Tip leaked all over the place lost a lot of paint out of it
B007QBU4UW|5|Installed on my 5.3l Silverado with no problems at all. Easy install and works great. This was cheaper than the local parts stores and was original GM part.
B00DRT8WIS|5|Looks great on the front of my 70's hippy van.  Nice plate.
B000EDSSEI|4|Does what I need
B005I4DO5G|4|Could have better light pattern on back side of bar. Overall I like it
B00E5OUOCQ|5|My boyfriend loves it! It fits his charger perfectly and works great!
B002FY23CC|4|fits good and looks good I like it.
B00R4ZIALU|5|what a deal
B0027URG0S|5|Works great on my 95 Honda fourtrax 300 4x4. Feels heavy duty and they use thick metal. Would reccomend.
B0041CAKZI|5|great brake pads! great braking power!
B007ITNF1M|4|Good Price
B000BQSIWK|4|still trying to get used to  not having to set everything  its nice not to worry
B00MM0NPGC|2|If I had it to do all over again I would steer clear from this light. My boat has not even been in the water yet with this light on, nor has it rained on it and it is holding condensation inside the glass. Both bottom and top plates need to be re-engineered  to accept a rubber gasket or housing to prevent moisture from seeping down inside the light. The light is exceptionally bright but I will not be buying another. The only moisture that this light has seen is early morning dew, which is very very little in Mississippi.
B0000AY3X8|5|Great Chamois!
B0018C85VK|5|They work perfectly and arrived on time
B00ESMSOOU|5|This is just what my family needed for our car.  The Quick Flow Compact Sir Compressor fits under the seat without taking up foot space.  It is truly compact and light weight. When called into duty, it worked well on filling our low car tire in a few minutes.  We will be adding another for our other car.
B000C2WF9A|5|works good
B000BZWX40|5|not the problem
B000SNBSMI|5|Worked perfectly to cover our tandem bicycle.
B007L2JNJ4|5|Great fit
B00QEXOMY2|4|Very bright and improved the night ride by 30%. Extremely white with almost a tinge of blue ice to it. Its on my kawasaki ninja 650. Only thing is the beam isn't focused as regular headlights are. Im thinking if these were housed in a projector headlight it would be even better
B00C0SQC52|5|These tags are awesome, and a great gift addition for cards, etc. Great quality for being so cheap!
B000ET9SB4|5|Bought this pump to keep with my quad in case of emergencies.  The first day out, it came in handy as my buddies’ quad required air in the front two tires.  He was bummed because we were out of town quite a ways and he already had his quad off the trailer.  I saved the day with this little tire pump!  I think he will be getting one now too.  We were only putting 5-psi into a small 10 tire but it worked great!  Paid for itself already!
B008MM1WNC|5|This was super easy to install on my tucson.  Well, it was easy once I recognized the part of the instructions that mentioned grease would help remove the band holding up the muffler.  but I digress, anyone who's considering having an auto shop install this for you...stop.  It's super simple and works great once installed.
B00ZYSVE44|5|I love this charger for my company Smart Electric vehicle.  It charges 3x faster than the provider 120v charger, and it was easy to install on our building by ourselves.
B000BZZPRC|5|Great price for a solid rotor. Replaced OEM Lexus GX470 with centric blank rotors and couldn't be happier.
B007VXCYOO|5|great just what I was looking for.
B00RM327NG|5|Best addition to my car! Holds the phone up and saves precious space in my small car.
B000F285EG|4|Works as described. Two things I like about this: keeps the handle from rattling around when the hi-lift is mounted to my hood and it keeps the handle from stair stepping down when I have the jack under load.
B00OFBMKR6|5|Love this mc hacket. Live in AZ and it's hot here ... it protects from the sun yet wicks the heat off me during the ride ... been in the rain a couple times and it drys out fast and clean.  Great value for what I paid here.
B00SVCHL42|5|Looks awesome.
B006WHEBGE|1|wrong part
B001UC9R2O|1|the worst brake pads ever dont buy this pruduct i don't understand why amazon sells  p.o.s
B004Q0SEBM|3|These are great lights, but notice there's no description of color. Even though they're black in the picture you'll only get them in chrome from this seller.
B00C7Y5F9S|5|fit perfect
B002INWTJC|5|This is a solidly cast hunk of metal.  It works well and does the job without issue.  A couple points to ponder before purchasing however:<br /><br />1)  It's for a 1/2&#34; drive.  Don't buy this thinking your 3/8&#34; standard drive is going to fit it.  You will be sadly disappointed and finding yourself taking a trip to Autozone or Ace or Sears to pick up a socket drive that fits it...at least that's what I did.<br /><br />2)  When you go to use it...use it to break loose the O2 sensor and then remove the socket and unscrew it by hand - otherwise, your wiring will get twisted up around the socket and if you can't see what you're doing, you can damage wires, connectors, driveways, paint jobs and possibly the planet itself.  Just.  Don't.  Do.  It.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a quick and easy process that the shop wanted $430 to do (part included) for a $30 part.  Ouch.  Considering it took all of 30 minutes, that's some pretty high dollar mechanic work!<br /><br />Replacement was on a 2006 Honda Accord and it was O2 sensor #2.  Which means it was on the cat and very easy to access.  Your O2 sensor may be in a much worse place - and if it is, I am sincerely sorry for your loss of knuckle skin while you attempt to remove it.
B004Z75HKW|5|Thanks good plugs and genuine
B00FJW5BFS|5|Awesome product... always best to shop for parts online.
B003YK5KHG|4|This step was an excellent addition to my 2007 Tundra. The TrekStep installation was easy with good instructions. It took longer to open the box and find the tools than to install.<br /><br />After a year of use my only issue is the paint is pealing off the step. I wash the truck and the step often, but the winter road salt is very destructive.<br /><br />This product would get 5 stars in a milder climate.
B00HWZMC6Q|5|Let me say that this mirror is LARGE.  Look at the dimensions of it, it is larger than any rear view mirror I have had in any of my vehicles.  Installation was simple and it is a benefit being able to see behind you without having to turn your head.  I have this on my ranger xp 900 2013 model, recommend it.
B00B8Z929Q|5|Product as described great shipping
B0002SQU68|5|Exact replacement for the stones on my hone.  Cut costs to 1/3 what it would have cost to buy a new hone just because a stone broke.  Every brake hone user should have a set of these in standby.
B00Y040VJ2|1|Shipping was painfully slow. These lights look cool at night...but only at night. You can't see them blink during the day because they are not bright at all. I am waiting to get a ticket for not using my turn signal when i really am. At night they are somewhat visible. I would suggest buying a different pair with more lumens if these are going on a car.
B00OWS4IQ8|1|Worst accessory ever!  Instructions aren't clear at all, and video isnt much better. With soft top door rails on, the back of the top can't latch to anything. They say that the top can be kept on when the hard top is on, UH no you cant latch the hard top freedom panels with the mesh on. absolutely not worth the money. Also don't think it keeps that much sun out either. WIll be buying another brand and will update this review to compare the two later!
B003PDUHF2|5|To my surprise, these grips slid over my old grips and didn't slip with the throttle! I even took them off after a 3000 mile trip and put them back on and still perform the same. Highly reommend.
B003ULT84U|5|These work great.  We order in bulk to help keep lead time down.  They are quite a savings compared to the dealership pricing, which helps our customers. Have already ordered twice.
B004I0LJE4|5|Looks good and fit perfectly on 2007 E150.  Much cheaper than the dealership part!
B000BOCAMQ|5|wow. i got this as a temporary solution, but the fix is hardly noticeable. I might not even need to get a new taillight now.YAY!
B009VZ5VA4|5|From the Anco website I could identify exactly the part I needed for my car.  ANCO is the only brand that I have been using for the past 40 years.  Since they are not widely available here in Florida, the order from Amazon was simple and effective.  Highly rated.
B009LOS0KS|5|Fiitted and looked great
B002QY9WIE|5|WOW!  Great for bathroom or car!  Clean scent!
B004J36J9U|5|Made my 2003 Suzuki LTZ400 run like a top! Thank you!
B0000AXV3T|5|does a good job of filtering the water
B00HP6XFVS|5|On time relieved as advertised
B004BS0M50|5|I had there previous version of this kit on a 2006 F250 diesel and wasn't so impressed with the lower brackets, this revision is a huge improvement. Also please note that if you have a diesel this is the one you want. I can't remember the other part number kit that is similar for the gas motors but it comes up in a search. The difference in the two kits is the bracket for the left side has an offset bolt hold and cutout for the DPF system. This is the 6.7 diesel kit.
B004DRYQ3I|5|The lights worked perfectly .
B003R7LP7K|5|Works great. Easy install. Can't tell th difference from the factory or the aftermarket one.
B004MHTWWE|5|It was just literatura described and it brins the pieces to mount it. Anothers dont do.
B00DMTTT8A|5|Wonderful.  Perfect color for the Chevrolet Cocoa/Dune interior. Keeps all the dirt and stuff off the carpet.  Easy to pull out and clean. Deep and sturdy.  They look better than the OEM all-weather mats.  I am happy I decided to get these and not the more expensive ones.
B0017UBHQS|4|As advertised
B004I0HDKS|5|Replaced the original light perfectly.
B004I0YWWK|5|Looks great! Installed in the picture is my depo piece after removing my factory piece. :)
B00429NKWK|5|A great kit to restore moderate fogging.
B00OZX4GGW|5|Good
B00VJUVSV0|5|THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST ITEMS I PURCHASED ON AMAZON!!!!!!!! THIS RETAILS FOR $400 FROM TOYOTA
B000GZRLJ2|5|Have not yet had a chance to put these to use but for the money you get a lot in a compact case.
B00AVYXOZS|5|Awesome
B004XONUA6|3|Nice unit but did not cool like I though it would for a 40 row.
B001BWE9MG|5|Exactly what I wanted...hope it lasts awhile
B00V9HLVLK|5|Super bright
B002HEZS4A|5|My boyfriend loved it!!!<br />It looks great on the car.
B0028PJ10K|5|These are great! We use the all the time while camping with our travel trailer.
B004QHR5CY|1|No it didn't meet what I was especting from it. Product to weak. First time install 2 nut broke off.and i will never buy this product again
B00I2Y01LO|1|it did not work with my car,I ended up keeping it because it cost more to send it back
B013VAKX5W|5|These are amazing!!! I put them into my 2010 toyota tundra rock warrior and it took only 5 minutes to replace all interior lights. There is simple instructions and they are truly plug and play. And wow what an increase in light. My wife forgot we changed them the night before and she left for work at 5 am and called me because she needed sunglasses to get in the truck. They really work great for the door lights they actually are now functioning shining light on the ground. The great part about them being true led lights they will not run your battery down if you leave them on for a period of time with the vehicle off. I would recommend to anybody who is sick of the dull yellow stock interior lights and want a cleaner brighter look to their vehicle. I received these at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review. I have already recommended to every family member and friend and few have purchased for their own vehicle.
B0037TRDY2|1|Doesn't work like it shows on the YouTube
B00I9TMROG|5|Simple to install and looks great. Cannot see inside through my 95% window tent from the outside with the lights on either, so that is a plus.
B005FM0LF2|5|Great and sexy
B00Y28JHQ4|5|This has to be one of the best buys on Amazon. Super easy to put together. The 3D drawing made it easy to assemble. Holds my Honda and KTM on the back of my Chevy 1500. Took it from Houston to California and back with no problem.
B0000CBIK5|4|OK
B008AGVRDK|5|Good work
B000ALJSIY|4|I bought it for my metro express transponder.  Had to enlarge the hole to allow access to the passenger number switch.  Easy to do with a Dremal.  Also used my sharpie to label the positions (2,1,3).  used the sticky tape on the back to keep the pass from sliding out when I set the switch.  The retainer is not strong enough to keep the pass when you move the switch in that direction.  It holds to the windshield well.  Would be nice if hole was big enough for switch without mod Update: The suction cups are not high quality, replaced them with larger US made suctions cups
B000C976MO|5|exact fit to the original motor mount on my 1999 oldsmobile 88. Was super simple to install and the difference after was very noticeable! so far so good
B009FIBXGS|1|didn't work with my car
B00LJ0N7VY|3|Its cute but there was a hole or hook to connect to the button at the top to close the garbage.
B00FY81BUQ|5|I used these to repair the map lights in my 2008 Honda Odyssey EX-L.  They are a perfect fit!
B005X4QCAA|4|Extremely easy to install, accurate just what I needed.
B00OZYHOE2|3|Can't where them with other glasses underneith them.
B009AA5R0Y|5|These are a fast and simple alternative to having to use spring compressors to put new struts in your vehicle.  Whether you're an experienced mechanic, or a novice wrench-turner, these simplify the job and make it safer.
B004TC1M5C|4|Great price
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Simple to use, seem to be very high quality, batteries last a long time. Range isn't amazing in the trees, but with a line of sight it'll go as far as my eyes can see.<br /><br />Definitely glad I ordered this set instead of the 5's.
B005636AEG|5|Good
B00F9L52N0|5|They're perfect and they arrived in like 4 days which wasn't expected. Thanks seller! Now my tib is looking extra fly.
B008G4Y076|1|These lights arent even bright<br />my stock lights were so much better.<br />do not buy
B00LO0M918|5|I waited until the last minute to decide to upgrade my toyhauler to LED lights, before a trip. All of the lamps I used worked well. I changed all of the lamps to LED and never noticed the batteries getting low, like they had in the past. We did run a generator everyday, but with the incandescent lamps it seemed like we always had to be conservative with the lights. The color might be a little odd, but it is much whiter and brighter than the old lamps. They saved power and made the trailer much brighter, so I can't complain, especially for the low cost.
B00MPE6ESG|3|Cheaper than OEM but quality is poor. You can see the wiring behind mirror.
B001FVEEDC|4|Tough to install but should fill the bill.
B001HMWZ5S|5|Quality, sealed bearings. OEM replacement
B00H554R98|5|Pretty much bullet proof sealer not just for RV's but other applications as well.
B00KBXDER2|2|Junk.  It tore at the seam while attempting to install.
B00KTHVBW0|5|This was a perfect replacement for my 2001 accord key fob shell. I re-used the buttons and gel cushion from my old one upon the suggestion of other reviewers. No need to trim the board or tape the battery. Works great as is.
B00Q1F4XIS|5|It worked just like I wanted it to and was delivered fast....tnx,
B003O90CI4|5|This is the one of best 12 Volt, internal resistance coils made.  It has epoxy instead of oil.
B00WO841EW|4|Works great for a 2015 V60 and therefore will fit the V60CC and S60. The foam creates a VERY tight fit; I don't foresee any rattling.
B00BCRMAAS|1|Material is too thin, it ripped too easily.
B00BITR6X6|5|What a great replacement! Would you believe my 20 year old tailgate works better than it ever has? Tired handle broke, I ordered this replacment and it arrived in 2 days (Amazon Prime). It took 5 minutes to replace and works as good as new. Great value!
B00877SL2M|4|working fine
B000C14QNO|5|Perfect fit for 1993 Jeep Cherokee and 2000 Kia Sportage
B00VAZMARU|5|The smaller of the two wrenches is exactly what I needed for my Craftsman lawn tractor's oil filter (Kohler engine). Works great!
B00G8S07FQ|5|Good quality sticker, thick vinyl, great printing quality.  Thank you!
B00FQ0QTBI|5|WORKS GREAT INSTALLED EASY FAST SHIPPING
B000CN4ZQK|1|Adapted perfectly to my c4 transmission along with the Kickdown lever extension. (1977 F100, 1406 Edelbrock) still needed e clip and one bolt was too long.  Update (08/152016):  Connected great, but could never get it to work properly.  Just changed to a Lokar cable which works great.
B00LIB35MA|5|I love this bumper sticker! It's exactly as shown in the picture. Fast shipping. Overall great experience.
B0095WUP8Q|5|So far so good.  Seem very nice.
B000BWCFT6|5|It is basic Teflon tape and works just fine.
B00934HADO|1|Cable worked great. But the light sensor was bad out of the box
B00HE6CI58|5|Ok...  So as I am sure that most of you out there just like toys...  However I have put this in the rear of my car in the cargo of a sequoia, in the entire car of a mazda cx-9 and a honda odyssey.  The only reason I was going to change all of the lights (even though they all work) was to be able to see.  Why haven't cars come with these before now is beyond me.  Everything is daylight in the car, even in low light.  I am purchasing 2 more as I need them in back of the van.  They are really well built.  My only complaint, is that they are a smidge longer than the stock bulbs, but I was able to cram them into the cx-9.  If you are wondering if these are the ones, get them and try them out...  our van looks like the sun is attached to the roof.  At night the back of my sequoia is very bright.
B004TLFZX8|3|Mounting was slapstick. Not really made for my model scooter. Sent back for a refund.
B00GG4OA3W|5|All dust covers where included and brand new...they arrived as stated and packaged perfect
B000LC87V6|5|Fit perfectly and keeps the dust out of my bearing buddies.
B0028UK7JE|5|It works it's long and we are very happy with it!
B0067MFQ1S|1|First of all attempting to get the alarm activated it was a nightmare. The instructions stated you have 20 seconds to take off the plastic strip and reassemble it. Not true! You have about three seconds to reassemble it before it goes psycho in your eardrums. So I thought screw it who cares that I paid more for this lock with an alarm hopefully it's still good I'm just not going to activate the alarm. All was well when the bike was not in use. Until one day I decided to unlock it and the key broke inside the lock! Now I have to call a locksmith to try and free my motorcycle. If it were a cheap lock I wouldn't be writing a negative review, but this is a high price for low quality.
B00O92Q8BK|5|Good
B0015PTVX6|1|The openings for the bulbs aren't the right size/shape for an '02 as Amazon claimed. Fits the frame pretty close to stock and looks good but you have to do some goofy stuff to make it work.
B00FFXDTEQ|3|Very bright but not water proof. You'll have to do that yourself.
B006BCRNYM|1|Keep does not work.  Works when I press it a million times or.very very hard.
B00QUYRQ66|4|Great replacement for the old ones,easy to install.
B00NEL7NY8|5|K&N cant go wrong.
B00CO3ORBO|1|this stuff is WORTHLESS..  there is NO adhesive on the product. I cut a small section, peeled the film off, but there is NOTHING to adhere to the tank on my motorcycle..  I don't get it..
B0071LS2EC|5|Great for handing out at work to people having a really bad day  :  )
B005H53HWQ|5|Best lights I've ever had and the distance you can see with them is remarkable
B000C1Q68M|5|Easy install and work perfect!
B00B1YZPCC|5|I used these on one side to make it easier to wire in some add-on foglights, without cutting into the original wiring. The sleeves and plastic were blue in the ones I received.
B000P17NXQ|5|Works perfectly. Simple to wire up to my 2013 Chevy silverado.
B00802GIW4|5|Awesome, love the brightness and color. On my Nissan Maxima. I paid an installer because Nissan engineers make it very hard to change your light bulbs. Hopefully these will last the life of the car.
B00JGJGLMM|5|its a good 2-gauge wire
B013IIZTTM|1|Bad quality,cheap Non Genuine Product
B00HNGBOL8|5|Purchased these for a local 4x4 shop to install, and they really liked the quality of it. I've been running these for a few months now and have driven thousands of miles; so far so good. Steering is on point, and the mechanics were able to align my Jeep once my stock ball joints were replaced.
B008HRX34S|5|Excellent product. Will buy again.
B00RPGWE9C|5|Perfect Fit.  Could not ask for a nicer looking liner.  It is so well formed, you could put the factory liner inside,  But I didn't.
B0023VDRDQ|5|great price and great Deal //Perfect condition
B00T57VASA|5|Came in a box which is unusual, usually they'll ship stickers and screen protectors in an envelope. Super nice though because I've had stuff get bent in the mail envelopes. Item is a nice size, not too big not too small. I like it.
B00PGGLOWQ|4|Great Deal
B00FZRLRFU|5|Quick shipping and a good price.
B003I4CY9A|4|Does his fit dual model  xdvd8181
B005HR2U7C|5|These maid the bike look bad ass.... we love them., very well maid, we are very pleased.
B0016LE80K|4|working great
B001UCILSK|5|good
B003BZD03K|5|Well made and doesn't leak.
B007CN9IJW|4|We needed these for our next car seat.
B0036JYHQK|5|Awesome product
B0044AZ4BC|5|can't beat the price for an original part
B00YBFUE1U|5|Worked great!
B007CTQJG6|1|Wrong model number advertised
B0049LSD0U|4|Its pretty good and great tight seal, but it has to be cleaned constantly around the cap in order to have a clean tight seal. Other than that it works great!
B00MVL1XFW|5|Worked well on my 50cc gy6
B00Y1CF6ZM|5|Exactly as described
B00ED3YVWS|5|Works great in 2008 Jeep Wrangler. Brighter and whiter. Be sure to check the lights before closing up the tail light, if the light doesn't come on just flip it the other way.
B00O2BZC92|5|Easy application. Perfect size. Looks awesome on my truck window
B0051SO7JQ|1|After my first use of the Power Station it seemed to be a perfect charging option for all our electronics on camping trips.  My second use left a completely different opinion.  As I was filling my air mattress using the inverter, the Power Station started smoking through the vents on the left side of the unit.  I quickly shut everything off and that is when a small flame shot out.  I blew it out and immediately took the charger outside the tent because I was not sure what would happen next.<br />I called customer service for the manufacturer and they were very helpful.  They replaced the unit immediately and asked that I send the faulty unit back for further inspection.  According to them there have been several instances where the unit has failed/malfunctioned while filling air mattresses.  Needless to say I am apprehensive about the replacement unit and the first thing I will do is test it on an air mattress to make sure this doesn't happen again.  If it does I will most definitely be asking for a refund and would never recommend this product.<br /><br />Update: The replacement was shipped to us from the manufacturer and the same issue occurred.  The product should be recalled as it has a defective part that is a safety risk.  We will be contacting the manufacturer to push for a product recall and to get a refund!
B0072RU5IG|2|Caused the motor to work harder when rolling the windows, and made scratching noises that made me worry that it was scratching my windows. I returned it because I don't want to risk damage to my windows.
B006O87UYQ|5|Works very well.  Because there's no oil used on the element, it won't foul the Mass Air Sensor like K&N will.  Made a difference in performance too.
B001B7A2L8|1|I would not recommend this product to anyone. It's extremely noisy. You can barely hear your radio over it. My air does not blow nearly as good as it did before, it defeats the purpose . It's best to buy it for $100+ from your normal parts store. Save your time and your money.
B00HZTDKZG|5|It works fine for my 2008 Suzuki GSXR.  One or two times a week and I know it's always ready to start.
B00SS8JRT6|4|It gives me lumbar support and looks nice in my car. The elastic band won't go around the seat but I still like it.
B000630D9Y|5|Can't beat the price for what you get
B00DSD4RPK|5|Husband bought it for his welding helmet. Stays on well and he loves it.
B004HGXMYE|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 WRX Base Sedan. Super easy install and a great price.
B00UHD4HJA|5|High quality stickers. Very pleased with my order :)
B000H8VYF0|5|Perfect OEM fit...been on for a few months now and they still look good and hold up to the UV light very well.
B00KJAZFMY|5|My original door handle broke, and this is built just as well, if not better. The price was very reasonable. The lock lever and handle don't line up perfectly, but the original didn't either.
B000AMAE36|4|Consider an HID upgrade for not much more, but for this particular application I wanted to stay with a stock replacement. Most of my other cars have been HID upgraded instead.
B005FL0752|5|Awesome customer service. Brakes work and look great. Ceramic feel is much better than original brake feel. Very quick shipping.   It's still early but so far no problems.
B00H5F2G00|5|Add some &#34;class&#34; to your ride!
B002INR7JY|5|Fits great. Plug and play wiring harness worked great!
B0066TLORC|5|Perfect parts, fast shipping!!!
B00029K220|5|Flawless performance recommend for those who live in areas where slat is used for snow removal. No rust.
B00OZYHOE2|5|Best goggles I've ever had...Good idea with putting the extra nose pads for those with narrower bridges, in the package.... but they fit me without them.
B000BW8W7K|5|Sweet Deal
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product work wonderfully!!!
B0087NB0ZQ|2|Having read all the positive reviews, we were actually quite disappointed in this product, which we purchased to communicate between separate motorcycles (a two-unit set). With the face shield up, wind noise picked up by the microphones made communication unintelligible over about 30 mph. With face shields down, intelligible communication disappeared over about 50 mph. This was with two different brands of full-coverage helmets (one Shoei and one HJC), and with the &#34;noise reduction&#34; enabled. This was also using the small adhesive microphone, not the boom mic. Yes, the latest software upgrades had been installed. Oh, I forgot to mention that at one point during our first day of testing, one unit stopped working completely. Fortunately, it started working again after stopping and pressing the &#34;reset&#34; button.<br /><br />Since we had a big trip coming up within a week (no time to get a different product), I decided to see if anything could be done with what we had. Oddly, checking on various forums, I found that the wind noise is a common problem with this product, contrary to many of the reviews I had read. Anyway, I wound up doing two things, which seem to have made it adequate for the time being. One of these was to tape a half-inch piece of foam rubber over the microphones, about 2 inches square (not supplied with the product), making sure there were no gaps on the  sides. That pretty much took care of the wind noise problem. Except that I still noticed that as wind noise increased with speed, or if we talked any louder than in subdued voices, the communication got &#34;staticky&#34;, as if the microphone was being over-driven. Following a suggestion on one of the forums, I hooked the units back up to the computer, and disabled the &#34;microphone boost&#34;, which was a factory default setting. That seems to have taken care of the second problem. It would have been so nice if the manual had provided any information on these problems, and their solutions, so I wouldn't have had to spend a day experimenting.<br /><br />Another problem which we have not yet solved is that when using a bluetooth phone for verbal GPS instructions, the &#34;intercom&#34; must be turned off to hear the instructions. They will not override the intercom. So if you happen to have the intercom on, you miss the instructions. Maybe the override will work with a dedicated GPS, but it did not with our smartphone. That's a shame, because I was hoping there wouldn't be a need to purchase a separate $250+ bluetooth GPS to get reliable instructions.
B00873J0YY|5|Working great on all of our camping trips.
B00P1ZQOCC|3|looks great, could be larger
B001KSE0YI|5|Very satisfied!
B00LG07MZE|5|It arrived on time.  I have only used it once, but it is just what I wanted.  The instructions they emailed me helped me repack it in the small pouch the sunshade came in.
B00NCBPSDS|3|Nut in plastic housing had fell out and had to be glued in.
B00BONEC88|5|Perfect fit on a 06 Colorado came fast too
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great product for keeping my car clean! It comes with the cloth which is nice and allows me to keep it nice between car details. I love multi-use products and was excited to find a coupon for this one. I want to try it on my winter boots before the season starts so I will update my review then.
B004Q83TGO|4|Woks fine for maintaining the battery in my Expedition. I don't drive it much so I want to keep the battery charged. The box says it is not rainproof? WTH?
B004G7QFGG|5|Great product
B001CF3IRY|4|They're functional. They do what they're supposed to do. I like it. I'd recommend this, but if I REALLY wanted to get the proper d-ring, I'd get a Crosby.
B00873J0YY|2|I guess u get what u pay for:)
B004A6DSG8|4|Bought it for my X5. Fits nicely, same as OEM, in braking mode so far so I can't say about braking power but please make sure you have anti-squeak brake paste as they not come with it! That's why I gave 4 star. Each and every pads I've bought so far has one but not those.
B00RZHG3PM|5|All good
B00BICONB6|5|Fits perfectly and looks so cool.
B000OZTPIY|3|Seems to be worth the money.
B001J63ILW|5|Super!!
B00KG14LBM|4|Works well for us on our 2006 Seadoo.  I like the tie downs and the fit is tight.  They are in locations that are rather easy to access.  The fabric initially has held up well in the 110+ temps of our Arizona summer.  I would not trailer with it on but I did not want to pay for one that was trailerable.  The cover that came with the Seadoo didn't due to well staying on and wore out.  A new custom fit was almost 3x the price of this one.
B008SEBQ2G|5|Looks good on my Ram, works good.
B00KBTQFVS|4|Works great the only thing I missed when purchasing it was the temperature range does not work for my area to store battery's thru winter. I will still have to pull the batteries out and move them indoors. My mistake, didn't know they had a temperature range on these units.
B000OF9MJG|3|missing hardware
B00RCA2DGU|5|Good lights and well made - Thanks
B001TPUCKI|5|Shipping was fast and the fit was perfect. Motor works great and was easy to install.
B008KWL5C2|5|I couldn't be happier with this floor mat. It fits perfectly in my F-150. Keeping mud and dog hair is my #1 priority in my truck. It covers then entire floor and it's easy to clean.
B00JIHC36K|5|Very Bright Good for turn signals
B000H0PANU|2|The ridges on these are not really tall enough to provide any significant traction.  In any situation where you would use these, one assumes you're in a low-friction condition like snow or mud.  The tires will already be wet and won't achieve any adhesion to the plastic of the mat, so the only source of &#34;traction&#34; would be mechanical keying of the tire tread into the ridges of the mat.  These ridges are too short and spaced too closely to allow that (they just fill up with mud and snow being deposited off the tire).  If you do manage to get a grip on them, they'll slip right under the tire and out the other side, because there's not enough on the underside to keep it in place on the ground.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I never tried using it on dry sand.  Given its design, it may (MAY) work pretty well there.
B008HZM5SA|5|Replacement high quality, fast shipping, recommend
B0034Y2V3I|5|Fit both my lexus and highlander. Great price point...
B00192KZQ2|5|Very handy.
B00B2ATTUE|5|I can't believe the difference,don't have<br />To reset the chicks everyday do to wheel movement, I would recommend these.
B00W8ADB1K|4|Great product. Just the right size for keeping the extra items in my vehicle organized. Only issue is that (for me), the strap wouldn't tighten all the way. I'd like to have it real tight so you wouldn't see the straps under the headrest, but alas as much as I tighten it to the max, it let's off at little slack again as soon as I let go of the strap. No biggie, but it'll be a 5 star if I could get the straps hidden. Makes it more visually appealing.
B005LL8ZQ4|5|It's perfect! I love it :)
B000BQRBB4|5|Easy to use
B0013CP8N8|5|Great Bulbs Fast Shipping love em A+
B00M9LSVSG|5|Great products, and great seller.
B00OI5WESE|4|Love it and it fits great
B006G14FK8|5|Works so well, I ordered another unit.
B000FQBWCY|5|Working nicely.
B00THK4KAK|5|Meets my expectations for my 1991 chevy blazer!
B001F8OX6I|5|I've used Maxxair products for more than 15 years.  Easy to install and looks great.
B000JZF9H0|1|It broke in 1 week dont even think about it
B00QVYTVRW|5|I need Set of four - can I??
B001PWFPE8|5|Works pretty good so far. Easy installation
B00GTJV9RY|5|Perfect fit.
B000NVW1LM|5|Sealed a leaky vcg on an old Saturn. No complaints.
B00T62RK1U|5|Easy install an they seem durable. Also brighter than I expected.
B00I134A6I|5|These are great since they are small and fit anywhere, turn on and read the pressure, remember the value, and speaks it.<br />For my Motorcycle, they are indispensible, I keep one in the pocket on my gas tank.<br />For my Car, sometimes I go offroad or it gets cold, or who knows what and the TPM comes on - which tire and how bad (portable pump or gas station)?  This makes it easy.<br />I had - and still have an earlier one but it started coming loose - after several years service.  I decided to get another set.  This and maybe a small inflator  [[ASIN:B002ZC1EOM Slime 40020 Tire Top Off Inflator]] can keep you from damaging your tires, calling for a tow, or finding a gas station and maybe using the coin-op inflator.
B006QNUT7Y|5|Durable..
B002ZC1EOM|4|Great for motorcycles given its small size but as others have observed, you don't want to run it for very long especially on a hot day.<br />It also works for cars, but it is &#34;top off&#34;, just enough to turn off the TPM light for one tire, but then you need to use something bigger for a total flat on an ordinary sized tire.  You can only run it for a few minutes then need to let it cool down.  It works for my motorcycle with the smaller tires.<br /><br />The gauge isn't that accurate and the needle is vibrating when it is pumping 5-10psi, but it is enough to tell.<br /><br />Great for small jobs and where you need a small size.  Get a high volume version if you need a real inflator.
B000JWQDJQ|4|Better than the nasty stock Rancho shocks
B00IZK4XLO|5|Great buy my vehicle feels stable on the road again can take my curves hard..
B006S3XAQY|5|I had a pair of these for over 10yrs, never a problem, so when I bought a new cargo trailer, I got these, best dam lock I ever owned! Nobody's getting past these!! And they look great!!
B000E7WLKQ|5|Fits my Rola basket perfect. I used this on a 3,000 mile trip on and off road. Not a problem ever and best of all I felt secure knowing nothing was going to fly off my roof rack. This net fits whether you have a fully loaded bast or not. I was able to make it work. I used a few other straps just to be safe but this net covered it all. Didn't stretch out on me either. Great product and good price.
B002HSD19A|5|As others have said... After the actual struggle to get them on, they're great.
B00KWK0CCO|5|Exactly what I was hoping for. A simple replacement to a broken Toyota key case. Old parts fit in perfectly, took about 30 seconds. It is exactly the same form factor. Highly recommend if you broke your key and all Toyota can offer you is a $$$ replacement or a $10 &#34;pouch&#34; to put your key into.
B001GO76AG|4|Well my trailer hasn't been stolen yet.  I guess it's doing it's job.
B00TU9BD9O|5|As expected....would have liked some locktite with it.
B003YLMQHC|5|fixed my problem thank you for offering this part
B000GTX8R2|5|Great quality steel sprocket, bolted right on and fits my DRZ perfectly. Traded 14-50 setup for 15-47 for dual sport riding (with a 112 link chain), used to top out around 60, now am comfortable at 60, can cruise at 64-65 and topped out at 80 (faster than my 400 was designed to go, yikes!)<br /><br />NOTE: When changing your sprocket, torque against the nuts, NOT the allen-side. You'll strip them and cause a world of grief. The nuts are trickier to reach, but worth the trouble of tracking down a [[ASIN:B000NPZ40I TEKTON 4964 Impact Universal Joint Set, Cr-V, 3-Piece]] and extension so you can go in from the other side through the disc/spokes
B005L98BZG|3|They work!
B003IDFGPK|5|Just as pictured. Well packaged.
B00MJV2DH6|5|Great, installation was easy.
B004SEE1XG|5|Exactly the part I wanted. Delivered in good time and for a reasonable price.
B000HAEPAO|5|Used these to add rings to the end of a new aluminum dock to fasten rope to pull it in and out of the water.  They work perfectly.
B000CMFPJ2|3|Others have reported this product to be heat tolerant and used on engine blocks. It has been two months and the rubber is cracking in several places.
B002WSHSRG|4|It worked fine, but was really difficult to install on the hose fitting. Not manufacturer's fault. Blame Jaguar's lack of engine access.
B00BITI7KM|5|Very good! Within about a week I got it and easy to install 😊
B000CQQKGU|4|great product bought this so we could pull our boat very sturdy and cheaper than what you would pay in a autoparts store will buy from seller again
B00042KG3A|2|I was fairly disappointed when this arrived. First, the box wasn't sealed on one end; there is no doubt the jack fell out of the box multiple times. The  paint was scratched in multiple places and the parts don't appear to be high quality. The jack won't stand up with out the base (additional cost) and I feel like it's pretty unsafe without the base. I expected Hi-Lift to provide a much better product.
B00TF2S7BI|5|Fitted perfectly in my RAV4 side mirrors, it looks great!
B00K2FRXFS|4|The greatest fit ever. Would buy them again if I had to
B0015YD3AY|3|Thin, cheesy, but inexpensive as tire covers go.
B00KTJ0KA2|5|Works ok
B00HSTX274|5|Looks great
