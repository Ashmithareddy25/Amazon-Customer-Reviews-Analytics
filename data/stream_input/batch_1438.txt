0439023513|1.0|First, forgive my spelling, I am on my phone and am too lazy to correct every error.<br />I couldntfinish this book. I read the first two and enjoyed them. I only made it halfway through this one before I threw it away. Yes, tossed it.<br />I wont argue for or against the politics of the book. It is not the theme that offended me.<br />What I could not tolerate was Katniss's pessimism. In the first novel Collins did a beautiful job of using Katniss's doubt and fears as a foreshadowing tool to increase tension. Mockingjay is page after page of Katniss fearing everything and hoping for nothing. I am halfway through the book and havent found a single positive thought from her. Everything she says or does is full of self doubt, self loathing, or paranoia.<br />Had this ben the only book in the series I could have accepted this, but its not. Katniss has been rewritten in this novel as a complete sad sack, party pooper, and bitch. Yes, there are many places in the novel where she acts like a total bitch, a complete departure from the character she once was. She was always cold and detached, but in this novel when she isnt arguing with people, well, she is always arguing with people.<br />Aside from that, the first half of the novel was pretty awful. Maybe the ending makes up for it, but I cant stomach any more of Katniss in order to find out.<br />By the way, it was only because I had read the first two novels that I read this much. I cant say I found a single page of this one to be entertaining.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I could spend hours and hours playing this. I just wish you could add more energy so you could play a little longer in one sitting..
0439023521|3.0|This is an engaging young adult novel. The plot is fast-paced and the author dives right into the main conflict. The characters are a bit thin at times. This dystopian novel kept me reading, but the story-line would be even better if it were written for adult readers. Not too much is given away on how Panem became the new capitol, but the book does raise interesting themes of how media influences our lives and actions.<br /><br />Katniss is a great first-person narrator, but other aspects of this dystopian world could have been developed into much richer thematic material.<br /><br />[...]
B000TRXRUY|4.0|Just based on the number of times the plot from this movie has been copied you know it has to be amazing. A rare mix of excellent martial arts action and a good plot. Bruce Lee is a likable protagonist, the villain is obviously evil. The part that makes the movie interesting is the number of \\"grey\\" characters who are neither.  Do yourself a favor and watch it if you've never seen it. Only downside is the 1970's attempts at visual effects by changing the frame rate a few times during a fight scene.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love to play and make it their goal to pass every level.  we like it as parents as well because games are short and it is not a game that a child becomes wrapped up in for hours. we enjoy this very much.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Great, many twists and turns...a great book for 20 somethings. Cute, romantic, and a very fun read. Highly recommend this book to readers
B0079R8IYW|4.0|The case is black, lined with a light grey interior.  The card holder is also a nice feature, but doesn't function well.  The case's magnetic clasp does not work and the case won't stand if there are cards in the card holder. I'm also curious to know if the magnet could damage the cards?  Not really a risk I am willing to take for the minimal convenience.  The case also seems a little snug when compared to other cases I've purchased for my Fire/Kindle Keyboard that have a little give.<br /><br />The material does look luxe and has a definite chic factor when I pull it out.  It has a refined glmaour that makes me feel book smart.  I'm also rough on my kindles (they go in the purse with everything else) and so I am pleased with the overall durability and sturdiness of the case.  I am certain will do a nice job protecting the screen from keys and cell phones.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game!! Hours and hours of endless fun. My grandson loves to watch while I play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a welcomed change to the vampire books I have been reading. I would recomend all three books to anyone.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry (the Perry family with some additions) is a young, emerging country band with some lively modern country music - some composed by the Perrys and some by others.  It has the usual country music, varying from track to track, with Kimberly Perry vocals and some guiter, and using guitars, banjo, mandolin, violin, drums, etc.  There are 11 tracks starting with You Lu, and including If I Die Young, etc.  The booklet in the jewel case includes the lyrics of the songs and a listing of the musicians on each track.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like present day country.  Also see [[ASIN:0739083929 The Band Perry: Piano/Vocal/Guitar]]
B006W0QOF2|4.0|If you are expecting this movie to be a sort of copy-cat of [[ASIN:B002LANLDK Fast & Furious (2009)]] or [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]] then you're not going to get what you expected. Likewise, if you are in the mood for non-stop action and are hoping this movie will be like [[ASIN:B000NHS2SC Crank]] or [[ASIN:B0034G4OUO Faster]], you're going to be a bit disappointed. This is not a high-octane thriller. The movie actually moves very slowly. If anything, the movie reminds me a bit of the old Mel Gibson movie [[ASIN:B00000JDIQ PAYBACK]]. Like that movie, you don't have a lot of action, special effects, famous actors and actresses, souped-up cars and gadgets, or fantastical and unrealistic heroes and villains. Everything in this movie is firmly set in reality. The main character is not a good guy, but he has a good heart, and at least has some moral code to drive him (no pun intended).<br /><br />Violent scenes come infrequently, but are very brutal when they make an appearance. There is one car cahase scene, but it is at the very beginning. The movie moves steadily towards a final showdown, which is a bit predictable, but you can't be sure of how it is all going to turn out, and that's a big plus, in my book.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty decent movie that I think most people will enjoy. If you're a fan of Gosling, you'll definitely enjoy it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|my 4 year old loves all the markers brushes pencils and all sorts of colors for her to choose from. an array of  stickers and paper - all great for the budding artist.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This is truly a most memorable occasion and the performances by both JT and CK are superb by any measure.  The Troubadour is a magical place, and just considering the wealth of talent and musical genius that went before on this stage made the entire experience almost surreal.  You will not be disappointed with the selection of songs nor the quality of the performance by the artists.  Guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell Kunkel are stellar throughout providing precisely what is needed, never too much.<br /><br />A word about the audio quality that has been addressed by several other reviewers.  While I would agree that it is not the very best I have experienced on my system, I found that the DTS track was far superior to the AC3 2-channel digital mix.  This is likely because the 2 channel mix was not LPCM and I noticed this right off when comparing the relative file sizes....the LPCM track would have been much larger and contained more information, hence improving the recording quality dramatically and therefore, likely, some of the less-than-pleased and deservedly so commentaries about audio quality. I normally just skip the DTS track, go directly to the LPCM track and play back in 5-channel stereo (thanks to a tip from Bob Carver) but when I did this with the AC3 track, I noticed just what some of the other reviews were talking about....a fairly empty, flat and truncated sound that did not do the performance justice.  So, I would highly recommend setting your systems so that you are sure to be getting the DTS track!
0802473156|5.0|This book was a gift from my daughter which today is going to master degree in marriage counseling.<br />I started reading this book to learn better about mine and my wife love language.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|It matters not what generation you are in because this movie has something for all ages. It rates as one of Disney Studios all time greatest animated productions and will continue to stand the test of time.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This was a really good game for the money. It had a great combination of hidden object puzzles and exploring scenes.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game love the grafics and love ice age. just love it. my kids love the game too just need to becarefull that they don't. buy stuff.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I thought that the game was pretty cooool. but then again me and my littly sister teamed up to find all of the answers or cloose. heeee heeee heeeee.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Another inspirational powerhouse from Sherwood productions. The Kendrick brothers are on a roll. With each new film they continue to challenge our faith, inspire us to greater commitment and uplift us.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like everything about this game except the auto attack. just make it real time fighting with controls and it will be perfect.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are amazing. I couldn't stop reading them. It is hard to think of the concept of which these books are written, but know its an amazing story. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its really a cool app but the games are really high priced and sometimes lame but for the most part its a really good FREE app.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The love scenes were so steamy, but I was surprised about all the S&M.  I ordered Book Two because I want to know how she will change Christian to be the man that feels love.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just loved the trilogy. It was an easy read and I didn't have to worry about graphic sex or language. It is really great for older teens as well as adults. I think it is a little too graphic for young teens and children because of the the idea that it is children killing others. The story grabs you and you can't put it down until you have read all the books and then you will wish there was more. It slowed down towards the very end of the trilogy, but at least it doesn't leave you hanging. For those that wonder how ithe first book compares to the movie, it follows the story really well.  It was the reason that I bought the books and l read the first book within hours of seeing the movie. I am glad that I purchased the books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it. Your town can grow at a good pace. Doesnt take forever to establish all your needs. Allows you to make choices just like any other Oregon Trail. Addicting and fun.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|good way to pass the time. the only downfall is i don't seem to be able to sell walls or flooring i no longer need.
1596912863|4.0|This book explores how modern women romanticize the Regency era Jane Austen wrote about and questions if we would be able to live without modern technology and increased rules on what in proper. When Jane goes to Austenland we see how difficult it is to change the way we were brought up even if we think we would enjoy living in a Jane Austen novel.
1118026470|5.0|I have to say that you can learn a lot about security flaws and generally for security around the web from this book and the first one!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I grew up in the 60s and this movie had me in tears. Tears of joy and tears of how things were before everything turned to drugs.There was marijuana but we never saw it on the streets. We were looking for fun and thinking about girls and cars and having a good time. This is how it was and will never be the same again.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This film is an eye opener! Every country is justified in protecting its borders, especially after a tragedy such as the U.S.A. experienced. But, some things that developed after that event, such as racial/religious discrimination are hurtful. This film is one I think the whole world should see. And hopefully it will help decrease the amount of discrimination that exists in our world. Shah Rukh Khan is fantastic in his role. And Kajol is great, too.
B002SF9YNO|4.0|I don't think the Japanese are good film-makers but this is probably the best Japanese film I have seen. It took me limb by limb eventually breaking my emotions down by making me understand just how Japanese emotions work and by the time the film ended I was wiping my tears for fear of someone walking into the room seeing me. But trust you me, this film is better than just being called a tearjerker, its difficult to describe. The lead actor MASAHIRO (very popular Japanese name) is just terrific. There are so many things I had never quite thought about before watching this film. They are still going on in my head and come out in the form of conversations with others.  \\"is your present ideal job really your ideal job?\\"
0062073281|1.0|I really wanted to get into this book and then in the end when it finally seemed like the good stuff was coming it ENDED what?! I agree her other books were far more better then this one I'm disappointed.
B000P0J09C|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and it still is one of the most realistic Vietnam stories every told. The boot camp scenes are just like it was.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is great and easy to read. If you are looking to read a new romance and thrilling book this is it. I am a slow reader but i managed to read it in 2weeks and a half.  Great, really great!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so much fun. Glad that this app free, but I wish I didn't have to buy credits and points. Would prefer if it were a little more like the original.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It was fun in the beginning and then everything went to outrages times to get done, like 153 hours!!! If they can tweak the game a bit and fix this one flaw I will install again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The Angry birds isn't what I expected at all. I was under the impression this was for kids. Think again! I have been challanged in different ways that it has got my reaction ability to it's peak. My military service came in handy in that you have to calculate time distance and strik zone. I play the angry birds when I have free time and it also releaves a lot of tension. John!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Kind of along the same feel as cowboys and aliens.  Love the story line and they could have made several more movies off of this.<br />Its also a crying shame that firefly was cancelled after one year.  While I know you can't please everyone, It appears this whole series has quite a following.
1612130283|1.0|I'm really puzzled at people who rate this as a 5 star. Come on, would you rate a Penthouse article 5 stars?-- I think Penthouse is probably better! It just tells me how screwed up women still are (no pun intended). I think a lot of women have never read any erotic fiction so when this book entered the \\"mainstream\\", women went crazy because they are taking the book to bed with them along with their battery operated devices (no, not a Kindle). That's fine. Read it and make this woman a whole heck of a lot of money. She seems like a nice woman but don't call it great fiction! That is ludicrous. Plus, I kept thinking is this what we want our young women to aspire to? A guy who \\"spanks\\" her when we've got a serious problem with domestic abuse in this country. Let's just hope guys don't read it - especially someone with minimal intelligence. He could take this crap seriously - remember Cape Fear? You could end up with a piece of your face missing!
0345803485|1.0|I say \\"the worst in every way\\" because there is not a single redeeming thing about this book, nor do I suspect, the other two in the trilogy.  (In fact, if I were a betting woman, I'd say they are repeats of this one). The subject matter aside, that of a Dominant/Submissive sexual relationship....and it's purely mysoginistic take on this, it is almost vomitous.  Even for it's lowbrow genre (Erotica...or Pulp erotica), readers should expect, and actually deserve better.  Not only is it bad writing, but bad erotica, bad pulp, bad in it's lack of any character development whatsoever; it is repetitive (the same sex scene is repeated, in detail, almost verbatim, scene after scene....after agonizingly bad scene)....it is just simply BEYOND BAD.  The characters are NOT likeable in any way, nor do you sympathize or empathize with them...the author repeats the same, lame limited vocabulary/verbage...throughout.  The main female character is always \\"biting her bottom lip\\" and the a--hole of a protagonist is always \\"gazing\\"....<br /><br />Readers of this review are probably asking themselves why I continued to read such a bad book??? Because I was so INTRIGUED at just how bad it was, I was compelled!!! At first, I would flip from where I was to some spot, any other place, in the book...just to see of it would get any better...but, alas, it was just the same at the begining as three quarters of the way through...See?  I did finally stop the madness!!!<br /><br />I understand Hollywood has paid this most untalented writer a hefty sum for this drek....what can I say?  Besides the fact that most of what comes out of Hollywood is absolute garbage, so I am not surprised...it will be hard to put such a bad story on celluloid, without an NC-17 rating and some SERIOUS bolstering of the screenplay by a genius mind, (perhaps an expert on the pyscholgy of sexual dominance and it's root causes), and have it be worth watching....plus, I feel like it's been done with 9 1/2 Weeks???

B004SUWR2C|1.0|Though it doesn't mention it anywhere on the page or technical details, this app requires an additional 80mb download once you've \\"installed\\" it.  This is not noted anywhere.  Customers are not warned about this.  The Size of the file under Technical Specs is misleading (4.7mb is only the initial INSTALLER size).<br /><br />I've contacted Amazon's customer support about this, and they're looking into it.  In the meantime, I suggest steering clear of this.  This is highly deceptive on the developer's part and I consider it malware.  I'm uploading an image of the screen you'll get at launch.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite Author. If you like romance you will really like this book. I love the way there love scenes are well described.  The ending was a little disappointing but all in all the book was great.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have a car that was made before Auxiliary inputs were a standard part of a car's sound system.  As such, I installed, and reviewed, an adapter that allowed me to listen to my iPod and control it with my steering wheel controls and dash controls.  For the longest time, I thought it was the greatest invention ever.<br /><br />As years passed, smart phones evolved.  As a result, my new HTC Thunderbolt can do a lot of things my iPod can't.  But, the adapter I purchased for my iPod would only work with Apple products.  I didn't have a way to listen to anything that didn't already come installed in my car.<br /><br />Then I found the CableJive DockBoss.  It is perfect.  I just plug the adapter end into my powered Apple adapter and plug the other end into my smart phone, or tablet, using the 1/8 pin headphone jack.  I can now listen to movies, music, Pandora, etc.  My favorite thing to do is stream Pandora into my car.<br /><br />The down side is that the DockBoss only connects to the audio portion of the adapter.  Other than controlling the volume, it will not allow me to control the device from my steering wheel controls or dash, which only makes sense to me.  There is a product out there that will also allow you to charge your device at the same time.  But, that wasn't my need as I already had another charger in my car.<br /><br />The cable is long enough to suit my needs, but no so long that it won't stow away quickly and easily.<br /><br />This simple and affordable cable has significantly broadened the capabilities of the sound system in my car.  I have been able to preserve my iPod connectivity and add the ability to listen to any other device with a headphone output jack.  Fantastic purchase.  Great quality.  Happy customer.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|The show is fantastic but the image could be better. In low light sequencies we can see the grains in the image (I have a 40' full HD television).
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|If someone has a week stomach I would not read this book. Jaycee really does not hold back on her story. She does tell graphic images that occured to her while she was captive. All in all it was great book. The ending seemed to be a little slow for me  and I would of liked to have known a little on the court case and where her kidnappers are now.
B004XE0P5E|3.0|There was a joke on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" where Justin Timberlake plays Justin Vernon, and sings a Bon Iver song to a newborn baby. The punchline is that Timberlake/Vernon falls asleep singing to himself. That's a cut a bit too close to the truth for \\"Bon Iver,\\" the new CD from Vernon's namesake. There's a lot of tinkling drone, falsetto sweeteners and the occasional surprise instrumental appearances (a slide guitar in \\"Towers,\\" etc.).<br /><br />Taken in small doses, \\"Bon Iver\\" comes off as an even moer laid back version of Fleet Foxes, or an Ambient Peter Gabriel. Try and listen to the album all at once and you're going to get the SNL baby effect. Sometimes, like on \\"Calgary,\\" he plays with traditional rock, other times, like \\"Hinnom TX,\\" his experimental side takes him into \\"Amnesiac\\" territory, and that is not meant as a compliment. \\"Bon Iver\\" is, like that Radiohead album, both an acquired taste and a love it/hate it recording. I find it far more boring and static than exciting and artful.

0345803485|3.0|I was told by a friend that I should read this series and I did.  I was both impressed an disgusted at the same time!  I was really impressed by the story itself, and how it seems to wind around several stories at once.  However, too much of it got too repetitive too fast.  I was so sick of Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" having conflicting views and controlling her motives.  Yes I know that the subconscious plays a role in our behavior, but it's also called the subconscious because we are unaware of it!  Also, all the emotional issues that Grey is dealing with is more than any person with no sexual experience would ever allow in their life!<br />On the other hand, I could not put the books down!  At one point, my husband threatened to ground me from my kindle if I didn't turn it off and go to sleep!  I was completely engrossed by the end of the second chapter of the first book.  The ideas were great!  A part of me wished that Grey didn't have so much money and was a bit more of the same level as Ana, but the story wouldn't have come across as Beauty and the Beast as well if they would have both been broke.<br /><br />Enjoyed it, but probably won't read it again.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|I have to say the program on my Droid 2 is sluggish and locks up occasionally.  Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...<br /><br />Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.<br /><br />Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.

B00009V7PJ|4.0|I enjoied this DVD quite a lot. There is not much to say about the DVD, but the concert is what a Cher fan espects.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|To sum it up in 4 words: \\"I Love this Album!\\"  To stretch it out a bit, I'd just say that it's really refreshing to find an artist who thinks about conveying a message through his lyrics, rather than just finding neat, rhyming hooks that can be Auto-tuned to make the playlist.  In addition, the melodies are haunting and stick with you.  Although completely different from the works of Johnny Cash, there is something in the feel of Jack White's music that is uniquely American in a similar fashion.  This is a wonderful piece of work.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|Lots of buildup to a predictable ending... hokey plot... and rip off of other movies (\\"Heat\\" and I think \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\" ... can't remember movie, but without spoiling anything, there's a way they sink their cargo and then bring it to the surface again.)
B006JTS5OO|5.0|Since this is still on at the cinema in the Uk have ordered it for my son's upcoming birthday. He will love it would order from us again as you get films far far far in advance! Took about three weeks to arrive in the uk
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I love my new case its sleek and protective cover is a great place to not only store my kindle fire, but also my personal items especially if I'm on the go. The kickstand part doesn't work as I hoped.but that's the least.  I will figure it out somehow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was great, it was so good I am in the process of reading the second book which is very good too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  it has a very smooth controls and the music is nice and calm.  the puzzles take a bit before they are difficult to get perfects on but I still find it fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a wonderful game. It's very fun. I'm super happy I got this game. There's nothing wrong with the game, no problems, no anything! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is a fantastic and enjoyable game and I will highly reccomend it to anyone who wants a fun game to play.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I cant even begin to start to share my love for this game. it makes you multitask-plan-strategize-and more in a simple autoattack game where your only movements are forward and backward. being a huge gamer.....I can assure you this is one game you will not get bored with after one day. its free. its fun. its addicting. as I believe the custom to ending something epic is I will say this---nuff said.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome I love making families and I'm kind of scared that my sister might mess up the game
0545101425|5.0|i can see that this could be what we are looking to become in the not so far future if we American's don't wake up! Writen very well and I am passing it around.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book last year and never thought I would write a review...but with all the negative reviews I feel compelled.  I don't think this book is a BDSM book.  It is light on that.  What I loved was the relationship between Ana and Christian.  He is totally flawed and you find out more about that in the later books.  Ana is young and naive but she is the one that can \\"fix\\" him.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the HOT sex.  But who wouldn't want someone to take care of them.  But she was still strong enough to want to do things on her own terms.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a romance and erotic sex.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|Ian Gillan on vocals gives this Sabbath album a different feeling than other Sabbath vocalists. While Ronnie James Dio is still my favorite Sabbath vocalist, Born Again is well worth buying.<br />My personal favorite on this album is the song 'Trashed,' but all of them are worth a listen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I find this game to be fun and intellectually stimulating. At times, it can be extremely challenging and other times I find it to be very zen-like.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|omg this game is so fun when I wake up I play it I play it on my free time it is the funest game ever.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|My whole family loved the movie....ages 16, 56 & 65.  We originally saw it through streaming and then had to buy it!
0345803485|1.0|I was SO excited to read this. \\"It's so erotic!\\"  \\"It is unbelievably sexy!\\"  I heard it all...when it arrived I couldn't open it fast enough. I started reading, and thought, \\"Well this is a stupid beginning, but it MUST get better!\\" But it just never did. I'm a teacher, and it reminded me of something a pretty good high school writing student would come up with. After awhile my eyes started to glaze over and I thought this is seriously dumb. Yet I forged on, convinced if I just hung in there long enough it would be come even A LITTLE bit realistic and...well...good. It just didn't. I wasn't convinced that the characters were real. They don't talk in a way that is believable to me--and maybe the problem is that even by the time I was half way through, I still didn't care about them at all. Also--sometimes less is more in terms of sexual relationships in stories. I don't need a full on Dom/Sub 101 course in the middle of a book--overkill. Lifeless, dull, disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I bought it for kindle and I loved it. Once you finish this one you won't be able to wait to start the next one!
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|The first two books were more than amazing but do yourself a favor and do not read the last one. The author completely change the theme of the book from the last two. Mokingjay was so bad it ruined the first two books and made them pointless. Do yourself a favor before you buy the hunger games and go to a book store or borrow a copy of Mokingjay and read the last chapter. You will save yourself a lot of time and be glad you did!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy follows Anastasia Steele from innocence to womanhood, showing the reader a tenderness and compassion for the characters and their story seldom encountered. Ms. James is one of the very few writers of erotica who gives the reader not only a breathtaking story that keeps us glued to the page, but insights into their souls, and our own.<br /><br />I recommend the Fifty Shades Trilogy to everyone of legal age, without reservation. It is a superbly crafted body of work, and not to be missed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Pleasant music, good sound effects, great graphics and control, clever and engaging puzzles, no stressful timer. This is a most excellent game. Thanks, Fallen Tree!
159514188X|5.0|I loved this book. The topic is a bit scary, but it truly helps one see how a small action can impact another's life; how just being nice to a person can make a difference; how a person can get to the point of thinking about suicide.<br /><br />The kids in my daughter's class were reading it and I thought it would be an important book to read as well.  I believe that it is age appropriate for youth...and for parents.
B000JQUZCI|1.0|If I did not have to read this for school I never would have read it. It was an interesting story line but horribly and not understandably written and is one of the worst books I have read in a while.
B0076OUXBE|5.0|This is a great book and a great work from Dr. Moriarty, it's time for the world to know who Michael was and his unique legacy, not just as an entertainer but as the best human being you'll ever know about
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I get into books when I read them and really enjoy them but this book I felt like I was really there and each time they got into trouble my heart started pumping and I got nervous and for the rest of the day I wouldnt be able to finish a conversation with a person until I finished my chapter. And I LOVED Jorge.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Addictive. you just want to keep unlocking games. There are so many games.. you wont be bored for hours. I love this game!
B004JN1CW4|3.0|This whole series is great, but very obscure. Things just kept getting weirder and weirder and that's cool. However at the end of this book things got a bit too wierd for me and it was a bit of an anticlimactic ending.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|the previous spawn blu ray that was released was from Canada, and although it said it was the directors cut, it was missing scenes and dialogue, so it wasn't the \\"real\\" spawn movie. but this one is set to come out July 10th 2012, I've looked on multiple U.S. websites one of which was walmart.com and the release date was the same as this one, as were the blu ray disc specs. which brings me to the conclusion that this is an official U.S. release and that this will be the actual directors cut for spawn on blu ray. with that being said, its going in my shopping cart for pre-order.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really cute. Its active and teaches basic responsibility skills with 'caring for the family', or hatching the eggs. We love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app so much!  It's easy to use and convenient. Having multiple versions on hand really helps when I need to switch quickly. Thanks for such a life-changing application.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time.  Gary Oldman is unbelievably good as Smilely, and all the supporting cast are fantastic.  Yes, it's intricate, yes it's multilayered, yes, you'll probably require multiple viewings to catch everything ...  but these are all GOOD things!  I've already watched it five times (not my usual response to most movies), and I'm sure I'll watch it many more times over the years.  Now that's a movie!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|accidently bought the hd version of this game on my kindle fire. figured what the heck its Oregon trail! so I gave it go after the 300Mb download. In app purchases have no place on my machines. cant wait to uninstall this crapware!
0385344228|5.0|This mystery is a gut-wrenching exploration of nature vs. nurture. It also portrays how a crisis can change blithe normalcy into a tempest of contempt, guilt, blame. A 'happy' 35-year marriage turns in a day. Regrets. Redemption? A compelling read.<br /><br />I think it would give every parent a cause to reflect and wonder, if but for the grace of God go ...<br /><br />Well done.<br /><br />Carol Colitti Levine<br />thesidetrek.com
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very good game. would recommend other ways to earn energy rather than purchasing it for a ridiculous price.  great time waster and on the go game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible. It is so useful in Bible study. I use the audio Bible in bed at night with my ear buds before I go to sleep.  Thank You
B007ATHNJA|4.0|In my view, this is the best of eight productions of \\"Poppea\\" that I've seen so far, but it is still not 100% right. It is very difficult indeed to approach the level of perfection of Monteverdi's and Busenello's masterpiece! This production features great music under the direction of William Christie, a very good staging concept by the veteran director/designer Pier Luigi Pizzi, and a rather mixed bag of singers. Philippe Jaroussky as Nerone was the most memorable to me, far removed from the \\"angelical\\" image that has unfortunately stuck to him. As commented previously by other viewers, the daringly staged duet of Nerone and Lucano (the excellent Mathias Vidal) was the real highlight of this production. Max Emanuel Cencic as Ottone was a pleasant surprise, since I read some negative comments about his performance in this production. Ottone is a thankless role, but Cencic managed to convey the humanity and suffering of this character very well. Notably, the tessitura of this part lies lower than Cencic's normal range, which emphasizes the great technical facility and versatility of this singer. Another pleasant surprise was Ana Quintans as Drusilla. Several singers were very good but predictable, including Danielle de Niese (Poppea), Anna Bonitatibus (Ottavia) and Robert Burt (Arnalta). Some others were not entirely convincing, such as Antonio Abete (Seneca), Suzana Ograjensek (Valetto) and Jose Lemos (Nutrice).<br />Regarding the staging, I liked the elegant sets, the eclectic costumes that served well to convey the timelessness of the story, and the absence of unwanted stage business. The camera work emphasized the interactions between the singers and the players, so that it looked almost like a semi-staged production (the best way to present a Baroque opera, in my view). A big disappointment was the absence of any informative printed material or of extra features in the DVDs, particularly since it took Virgin two years to produce them! Nevertheless, the production is highly recommended to all the lovers of early opera.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|No game needs to know my location or automatically launch at boot.  Just say NO to garbage like this game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|well the title says it all. its glitchy but amusing. just be wary of accidental purchases. this last sentence is pointless but there's a word minimum apparently.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|thank is game its like Mario bros....takes me back to when I was a kid...plus its a great time killer...the first three levels isn't that hard so its easssyyy for anyone to pass.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love it! gives u lots of fun goals to reach keeps things from getting boring... love the mini game u get rewards and its just like fruit ninja with the ice age twist!!! good luck catching the acorns they can get by pretty fast!!!!

0439023521|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins is fantastic, thrilling from page one onwards. I had heard the hype from friends who had loved the trilogy, but some of these friends had also loved the Twilight series, so I was unconvinced. Still, I wanted to watch the film, and so I picked up the first book just as the movie came out, and couldn't put it down until I was done, less than 24 hours later. The same went for the next two books in the trilogy (which I won't review separately). I actually found myself slowing down as I went because I knew once they were done, I'd be sad.<br /><br />The story, which you probably all know already, is set in a grim post-apocalyptic world with our 17 year old hero girl, Katniss Everdeen, a stoic archer hunter, who has to survive the Hunger Games, a deadly to-the-death match held annually to keep the various districts of this world in line. Add in two love interests, one dark, one fair (both comely), lots of villains and dangerous ground to cover, snappy and lovely writing, smart psychology, fabulous sounding costumery, and a series of landscapes that are just familiar enough to ground and strange enough to excite. Voila, a week well spent. I highly recommend this series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great app for my collage comute and i think its a good skill testing game for all age's
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i bought this to see what all the hub ub was about before the first movie came out.  Boy i was not disappointed.  i couldnt put it down.  i read all three over the course of 5 nights.  i wanted more when i was done.  great books.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Dynamic new album from masters of thrash! Suberb production combined with skilled musicianship and excellent riffing. A must buy to all who have ever been into thrash. And Overkill.
0345803485|5.0|I am a dominant woman!  As I write my review, I had very good ideals of what I would read, but<br />it did shock me as to how much knowlegde she knew of the world of BDSM! I love this book, how well it is written and she took the time to write the papers the sumbissve would sign!  She takes us to places many people did not know about at all! He is tender but a \\"Dominant' which in many peoples minds the ideal he would be mean and not caring , this is a mistake that many people would think how he or she would be!  She shows how the dominant takes<br />care of the needs and what fears the submissve has! But it show also how he seeks out what his submissive wants and how it truly he wants to know her thoughts, the hard limits the soft ones it is all written so well.  It is an open book for others to understand the world of BDSM!  When she wrote about the trust issue which is so important for this type of realtionship to grow it is a must in the world of BDSM!  I have read one other review, and yes it is so true that I did stay up until 6AM!!<br />This is one book that has me not doing anything I should be doing this is not a book to take to work, it is to stay home!  I have left dishes sitting in<br />the dishwasher!  I have a submissive, it is a realtionship that is different but when it comes down to it is has the ideals and<br />needs as any other relationship!  But this wonderful hot book has given me a very fresh look into the world of BDSM!  I made sure to buy the second book Fifty Shades of Grey Darker, which I am so glad to purchase!  Thank you so E L James for writing one of the best romnance novel ever written!  I had read hunderds over the years!!!!
1860497586|5.0|Book was great, yet sad. It is a sage that still goes on. I recommend this book to all females out there who need to step up and stop this insane practice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the first book, I couldn't put it down. This is a great series for young and older adults.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so much fun!!! but it is not at all like the old school game ... once you get the hang of the game it is addicting
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read a lot of books, but I must say the Hunger Game series was one of the best series I've read.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|like all I got the glitches. 58 hours to do anything. I thought about buying money. fortunately. I was paying attention because what they offer for you to buy and what you buy os different. 19$ for 150 points plus 50 free points is actually 19$ for100 points and no free points. just be heads up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Third book was as good as the first two books, you can't put them down until their finished. Great series for young and older adults.
B00756GKBA|5.0|this is possibly Madonna's best record ever.  it is definately her best since \\"Ray of Light\\".  using her gift for employing the best producers in dance music at the moment, MDNA keeps you guessing on every track.  no two songs sound alike yet the record is cohesive.  repeated listening makes it all the more intriquing.  on the first disc, Girl Gone Wild, Gang Bang, I'm Addicted.....to Love Spent, the club beats keep swirling but never cheapen the songs.  the last two tracks are slow songs that are beautiful and take the tempo down a notch.  disc 2 opens with the best song on the record:  Beautiful Killer.  the lyrics are clever and catchy and the sixties vibe makes it a fun yet moody track.  I F***ed up is the weakest of the 4 new tunes on disc 2, but considering all the great tunes around it it is still a decent tune,  B-day song is also a great song with it's 60's girl group vibe and expected Madonna naughty lyrics 'give me a spanking, start this day off right'  \\"Best Friend\\" is a slower tune that slowly builds in tempo.  the weakest track is the lame \\"Party Rock\\" remix of \\"Give me all you Luvin\\"  much better mixes of this tune are available all over the web.  this is Madonna's disco divorce record.  no offense to Adelle (she is a great artist who made it big on two break up records) but Madonna made a break up record that is fun to listen to.  Madonna still brings it hard.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i just wanted to see what all the hype was about the hunger games movie, so i bought the trilogy. i read all three books,out loud, to my husband in about two weeks. it was so good we could hardly put it down. then we went to see it at the movies.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First, I will start off by saying that the main character, Christian Grey is very interesting. Learning about him and his past kept my attention. The other main character, Anastasia Steele is pretty annoying. On the other hand,  some of the scenes are very exciting. However, after a while, those scenes get old and kind of repetitive. My major problem with this book is the poor writing. The biggest problem I have with the writing is the lack in variety of vocabulary. The following words and phrases are repeated OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It is very annoying:  exquisite, inner goddess, and oh my. If I had a dollar for every time these words were written I could probably buy myself a new summer wardrobe. In addition, the writing is very choppy. Transitions are not smooth at all. I guess my problem is that the author is making a ton of money off of this book, but has poor writing skills. To her credit, she clearly has a very creative and vivid imagination and probably has a really good time in the bedroom. If you like cheap porn, this book is for you.
B00466HN6S|4.0|Really cute movie, bought this movie before even seeing it for the first time..I did the right thing...it's funny and cute.good buy, I always come to Amazon for movies.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|Not too long ago I decided to replace my old Capitol Records copy of Happy Trails with the version from BGO as I can't afford 40.00 for the Japan import, not realizing that this version was released. The BGO 2010 version arrived and even though it says remastered, it simply sounds like a repressing of the early Capitol version which I wrote about in my review for it. A couple of days later I was getting ready to write a review for the BGO version of Anthology when I noticed that someone who goes by rash67 had mentioned this version from 2000.<br /><br />I immediately picked up a copy which arrived today and WHOA MOMMA, HAPPY TRAILS HAS NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD!!!!! This version is superior to the other three cd versions I've heard. In fact, the only drawbacks that I can see about this version are: if you play this in a car, you'll get so lost in the hot playing that driving into a ditch will be unavoidable and if you play this on a iPod while walking, you'll surely be pulled in by the police for the unavoidable dancing that this album leads to. For the love of all, Capitol give Repertoire the rights to Quicksilver's back catalog for remastering!!!!<br /><br />Happy Trails, Quicksilver's second album, was mostly recorded live at the Fillmore East and West in 1968 as well as some studio recording done live at Golden State Recorders. It was released March 29, 1969 on Capitol Records and sold quite well hitting #27 on the Billboard charts. Guitarist Gary Duncan had already left the band by the time the album was released. The first half of the record is given to a cover of Bo Diddley's Who Do You Love with interconnected sections with different band members each getting a chance to shine. The second half of the album begins with another Bo Diddley song called Mona. Mona gives way to Maiden Of The Cancer Moon which, in turn, flows into Calvary which has a nice exotic flavor. The album ends with a short cover of Happy Trails. A must have album!
0345472322|5.0|Mindset is the 'pop-psyc' version of Dweck's earlier academically oriented book \\"Self Theories\\", and it is well worth the read. Dweck takes her comparatively dry scholarly content and brings it to life with great examples of well-known leaders of sport and industry, intermingled with easy to understand summaries of her high quality research.<br /><br />Mindset has the power to transform your thinking - and the results you get in your life - for the better. By shifting our 'self-theories' (the ideas we tell ourselves about our intelligence, personality, and more) from entity-focused to incrementally focused, we are more willing to approach challenges with a learning orientation. This means we take smarter risks, persevere in the face of failure, and improve our self-efficacy. These changes mean we achieve more, and we feel better about ourselves.<br /><br />I read this book and loved it. Mindset is easy to read and contains credible content from one of the world's most esteemed psychological scientists in the goals and motivation field. This is a book that can really change your life.<br /><br />Highly recommended for teenagers.<br />Justin Coulson PhD
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed being able to read all three books at one time without having to wait for each one to be on sale in the book store.  As far as I can tell, the Trilogy was true to all of the books not just pieced together.

B0079R8IYW|4.0|Since I like my Fire, I want to protect it.  The Marware Exchange Case Cover with Stand will do that nicely.  It is made of a nice quality black leather with grey inside.  There is a frame that the Fire slips into, which leaves all of the important things on the top and bottom accessible.  The case has magnets that hold it closed.  The cover folds back and there is a tab on the back for the edge to fit into to allow it to be stood up to view a video without having to hold it while watching.  I didn't find that the tab felt very secure.  You can also stand it only in landscape position.<br /><br />I also purchased another case that I think I like better.  It is the [[ASIN:B005QBK6B6 rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Red) Leather Folio Case Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire 7-Inch Android Tablet]].  The reason I like it better is the the frame the Fire fits into can be removed from the case which makes it less bulky to hold.  This case velcros into the cover and allows you to use the stand in either the landscape or the portrait positions.  I also like the red color.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I start this off with cursing Sylvia Day. Damn you!! Damn you for making me addicted to this book! I'm addicted to Eva and Gideon's story. The sex scenes were erotica at its finest. These two make one delicious story. I loved everything about this book, the characters (Cary needs a hug and swift kick to the ass, unsure which comes first though), the setting (NYC is pretty awesome), the pace, the emotions, the story length...hell I even adore the damn wardrobe.<br /><br />Gideon...hmm...he's extraordinary. I was so upset when I got to the last word. I wished it could have went on. Hence me cursing Sylvia (but the cursing is coming from a good place, so don't fret, I enjoy the literary crack Sylvia provided.)<br /><br />I am anxious to know what happened to Gideon. And anxiously await the next book in the series. (HINT, HINT, HINT).<br /><br />So I recommend this book to people who adored \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" and stories like them because, \\"Bared to You\\" is one you definitely want to add to your shelf.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I would love to give the app a try! If it could past trying to connect to the Internet. I have a good, strong connection, but the game refuses to connect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was looking for a new book to read, so I went to the KINDLE BOOK STORE and opened THE NEW YORK TIMES BRST SELLERS LIST.  BOOK ONE OF FIFTY SHADES OF GREY TRILOGY was the #1 book.  I downloaded the sample and decided this would be  a fun read. The sample really didn't get into the REAL STORYLINE and I had not heard anything about this book or the Author.<br /><br />After a short period of reading, I thought, what the S _ _ _  am I reading!  Of course by this time I was truly intriqued and had to continue. Shortly thereafter, several of my friends began to tell me of this new book they were reading. I had to Laugh and ask if it was FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. THEN, the talk got really interesting. You just wouldn't believe .........  Anyway, if you don't get your hands on this book, you are truly missing out.  Come on E.L. James, GIVE ME MORE!<br /><br />I have just finished the third book and all I can say is HAPPY READING  and ENJOY!<br /><br />J. Smith
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is a very fun game for those with nothing else to do, which BTW, happens to me a lot. You control a squirrel using your finger and avoid trees. At first it is very fun and easy, but then after you play it for a while, it gets really hard. The quests I haven't defeated are \\" very narrowly avoid 40 trees in one round\\" and \\"grab 15 gold nuts without touching a regular nut\\" Is this fun? Yes. Good for those with a ton of free time. Would I reccomend this? Maybe. If the person can spend some free time, yes. If you are busy, I don't reccomend this because it is highly addicting.<br /><br />F.Y.I. This totally works on a Acer Iconia Tablet

B004IFD9HE|5.0|I saw this in theaters with my husband when we were dating. It is an amazing movie with a lot of funny characters and scenes. We love it and watch it everytime it comes on t.v. We have recommended it to many friends and family members.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|great puzzle game. lots of fun if you like strategy games. love that it gives you hints too if you need it.
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|I was thrilled when i bought this in anticipation of many scares, boy was this a let down. Yes there were probably three scares in the whole film which left long, drawn out segments of nothingness. A bored girl a bored guy boring us the viewers. Seems the director had a great idea for a short film, not a full length feature. Save your money and spend it on some really good edge of your seat thrillers.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Another hit from Angry Birds.  This is a lot of fun - definitely takes my mind off the stresses of the day.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have to admit, I was one of the late one's everyone I knew read this book & kept PUSHING me to read it. Believe me the saying \\"NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER\\" is the truth! You can't help but fall in love with the characters and love the time setting. From beginning to end...you'll be one edge to find out what happens next to the characters & the overall story (plot). If you love this book then check out the GAME OF THRONES series Sundays @ 9PM EST!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game cause there's always something to do and the story line is funny, ice age is one of my favorite movies!
1400049628|5.0|Very entertaining and well written book that flows quickly along.  Also provides interesting (and unsettling) thoughts on how people would probably react in such an emergency, or any  emergency for that matter (i.e. Remember Hurricane Katrina?).<br />I hope he writes some more......<br /><br />By the way; Great service from Amazon.com, item safely and quickly shipped.
0393080269|5.0|This book picks up where most others leave....while providing the reader with enough relevant statistics and numbers to provide colour on each of the countries, regions and arguments made - it excels at brining in the role that politics plays (and not) in determining the fortune of a country and by extension its economy. Most interestingly it provides a view of the coming decade that stands apart from the consensus today - i.e. that China will continue to grow gang busters, and that the west is lost to Indians (not the 'red' ones this time). I have followed the author and his writings over the last decade and he was one of the first to position that the last decade may be lead by the emerging economies - a mega-trend that few saw coming and all recognised only too late in the decade. The author makes a convincing case of why the coming decade may not be the one lead by commodity producing countries - but by those who focus on value creation - be it in services, manufacturing or in the agri economy. It reminds the thoughful observer - that trees do not grow to the sky, and that every trend changes once its illusions are spent.
0385344228|4.0|Loved this book, though struggled with the author's style when covering conversations between characters, especially when there were more than two involved.  The ending will blow you away and make you want to go back and re-read the book to see what you missed.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I love this cable release...it served me well with my D50 and now with my D7000. However, don't be stupid like me. I was driving down country roads, pulling over to shoot...and I just laid my tripod down in the back seat so I didn't have to disassemble it each time. My cable cord somehow got smooched in the process and was literally hanging by little electric wires. So be smart & take remove the cable cord each time you store your camera on the seat (or in your bag). I just ordered another one and am not looking back.
B0073PZU82|3.0|There wasn't much to this plot.  Very predictable within the first hour.  It could of been better.  I enjoy Daniel's Craig performance but there just wasn't much to any of the characters.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun with thinking required!  I tried this on a whim but now I am hooked.  Simple to play yet the solutions are not always self evident.  This is my favorite game app so far...and I have tried a bunch of them.
B007T967X4|5.0|I cannot figure out how to collect the notes. Do I tap the green button, the red buttons, or the notes themselves? Some instructions would be great. I downloaded this for my daughter. I've been trying to teach her how to read music.
B004GTLVIQ|5.0|This is the second book in the series and I am enjoying it very much.  Well worth reading, it holds your interest from the very start.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I purchased this app...and 3 weeks later it stops working...waste of my money...<br />it was good while it lasted...but then again some of my other apps have quit too...maybe its a Kindle problem.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book and i love my \\"fifty\\". Men need to pick up this book and learn a few pointers about what women want. Every woman should pick this book up and read it. It will awaken the inner you in ways you never expected. When I was done with all three i missed the characters....:( It is the talk of the playground mom, in the bathrooms at restaurants, metro trains, yeah we love it!!!!
0525423656|4.0|The first 200 pages are slow. They are for a reason, it's hard to get through, but the author is setting up several small details that are important later on. It wasn't as faced paced or exciting as Matched, but still a good story. It didn't have as high a tempo as the first book, but I see nothing wrong with this because the characters are enjoyable. And that's what this book is about. It's more of a psychological tale of the characters. Plus, getting to see things from Ky's perspective is interesting and that alone sets it apart from the first book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is fun to play and I enjoy doing the tasks they give you. I however wish there were more items to purchase for your land.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game since its free. its simple to learn and play. should be able to get more cool stuff without having to pay for coins
B005HSL626|1.0|I tried playing this game a few times but every time I finished a level five ads would pop up. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem but this causes the screen to go blank and eccentially crash the game. If u don't mind the ads then I recommend that one could try this app. But for the most part look somewhere else.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. Great way to study the Word. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. YouVersion rocks!  Keep doing great work.
0143117009|5.0|personally,and in all honesty,jared's \\"collapse\\" was one of the most informative books i have ever read;and i admit it,i,indeed,become afraid of the fate of mankind's destiny and this planet after reading this book of his.people,know how to manage and make the most of your resources,jared's message to us is very touching and important...
B007WPM4V4|1.0|The episode title, \\"Far Away Places\\" seemingly implies to me like the writers of MAD MEN are all gone somewhere. Maybe their sidekicks tried to make up their bosses' absence with a redundant episode, I guess.  This episode is totally absurd. NO PLOT. DON'T WATCH IT.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is so much better than the original. And you also are battling gravity. So worth the ninety-nine cents. TWO PAWS UP(&quot;') (&quot;')
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game is fun.  My kindle Fire needed replacing.  I had purchased some acorns from my old kindle.  When I set up Ice Age on my new Kindle the acorns that I purchased did not carry over to my new device.  I not only lost what I had set up, but I also lost any remaining acorn that I purchased.  Very disappointed.
B00377V6IS|3.0|I KNOW what fans will say is \\"well, duh.\\"  I didn't realize that Opeth were mostly a death metal band.  I had only heard them through a Porcupine Tree Pandora radio and I liked what I heard, so I bought this.  Not really what I was expecting.<br /><br />I personally don't like death metal.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game in the world although it is like tap safari and tap zoo it is still a fun game to play
B000JIHP88|5.0|My 8mo-old son loves loves loves it!  We set up his crib with this mobile since he was 4mo, he has been loving it ever since.  The moving up and down leafs and the spinning animals are all very entertaining.  Whenever I turn it on, he would happily flap his arms and kick his legs with a big smile on his face.  He loves to gaze at the light-up graphic while listening to the forest sound or music.  I personally do not like the songs very much, but seems like some how babies love them.  Although my son cannot really fall in sleep with the mobile turned on, it keeps him wide awake instead, but it keeps him happy and occupied.  Also this is the only mobile I could find that have the spining animals facing DOWNWARD, a mobile is meant to be looked at from the bottom where baby is, not side view where parents are.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of them are lame... but a lot are fun. good time passer. i would have to say that the only down side is the controls for some snd yhe ads... not a 1star tho
0345803485|1.0|This book is a revised version of \\"The Story of O\\", which was published many years ago.<br /><br />Get yourself a copy of \\"The Story of O\\", which is a MUCH better read!
B00006L6YG|5.0|I've heard this music long time a go. Recently, when I was looking for SACD's I found this CD.<br />From the start till the end of the CD you can close your eyes and you think your in Brasil!<br /><br />This CD keeps me warm in the cold weather in West-Europe.<br /><br />By the way, the performance of Getz en Gilberto is also on a high level.
B000L53D4O|2.0|I got it cause it i was in my price range and it came VERY fast in Two days.Put it up for her in like two min. But Not that crazy for it now that I got it. Ever time I try to get her to stand with it .it is not much of a support of helping her stand,she goes to the let or right.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|This is a fantastic CPU for its budget range.  The main decision is whether or not to bother with getting the unlocked 2500k variant.  My opinion is that overclocking is rarely worth it, but if that is your thing, the price difference should not stop you from getting the k variant.<br />This is the coolest running CPU I have ever used, and is relatively low wattage in general- these are my main concerns beyond performance, as there wasn't really a winter in Los Angeles this last year.
B007SGM084|1.0|I started reading this online to see what Dr. Oz had women ranting about. Oh my goodness I read the first 3 chapters with difficulty. the language is stilted and lacks flow. The characters are no better than anything by Barbara Cartland or the cheap 1.99 romance novels. I much prefer Lady Chatterly's Lover for  erotic literature. I found this book silly and lacking any reality, it isn't even good fantasy or good sex. a man who whimpers at a girl wearing his underwear.. come on.. Save your money, and go watch some free porn, it is about the same.
B005Y9B5UG|5.0|great dvd, the best one of 2011! shakira rocks , her performance is awesome i havent seen any artist that can dance like she does, i hope everyone get this cd dvd
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Very good app. You can summon allies to help fight the zombies. It has very easy controls. My only complaint is that whenever you want to buy certain things, you have to purchase flu credits. I wish they could change this by being able to buy anything using the money on the game.I hope this helped.
B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|Took me most of disc 1 to realise what had happened as the show is so full of short episodes. I reported this messup and a refund has been given to me I understand.  Joan Stewart
0670023329|5.0|One of the most disturbing things I saw this year was an irate, gray-haired Socialist woman who was responding to questions from a man who was ex-USSR.  He naively (or cunningly) asked her which she preferred, North Korea or South Korea.<br /><br />She spat out her reply, \\"North Korea, of course!  That's the country with JOBS!\\"<br /><br />This kind of ignorance is scary.  I strongly suspect that if this woman were handed a copy of the book under review, she would toss it aside and mutter something about the Koch brothers and \\"capitalist propaganda.\\"  She would never dream of speaking to the author or his protagonist.  As Kipling pointed out in \\"The Gods of the Copybook Headings:\\"<br /><br />---As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man<br />---There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.<br />---That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,<br />---And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire.<br /><br />On the other hand, many knowledgeable Americans simply call North Korea \\"the Kim family estate.\\"  After all, the Kim family own the country and run it, from Kim Il Sung through his son, Kim Jong Il, through the current dolt who is heir to the kingdom, Kim Jong Un.  In addition, it turns out that if you really want to see \\"income inequality,\\" you need to go to a Communist country.  In North Korea, the masses are almost always near starvation, while the \\"elite\\" classes get such amazing benefits as \\"large apartments\\" and oranges --- generally living a much more meager life than the average South Korean salaryman.<br /><br />As Adam Smith sadly noted, in \\"The Wealth of Nations, \\"All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.\\"<br /><br />And the Kim family??<br /><br />Enormous country estates, with indoor swimming pools, yachts with swimming pools, apple orchards where the soil is fertilized with sugar (!) to make the apples sweeter.<br /><br />And, on the bottom end, the 200,000 North Koreans who are trapped in the country's gulags, which officially do not exist.  But there was a boy born there, in Camp #14, who managed to escape and walk to China.  From there he went to South Korea and then to America.  This is his story, of a human being turned almost feral, trusting nobody, severely beaten by his mother, who learned to snitch as soon as he left his diapers.  It is the story of how he was tortured, for no real reason, aside from the torments of daily life, where the ONE meal every day was corn porridge, cabbage soup, and pickled cabbage.<br /><br />While this boy was made to live the life of a wolf, the Kim family was of course living it up on their great estates, drinking the finest wines, eating beef grown only for them, and ignoring the millions who were sick from malnutrition and dying of famine.<br /><br />It may make you think of France before the revolution, although the Kim family seems to be a lot worse.to make the apples sweeter.<br /><br />And, on the bottom end, the 200,000 North Koreans who are trapped in the country's gulags, which officially do not exist.

B00000J7A2|5.0|Growing up in Lancaster, California in the 60's was a time like no other.  When Beefheart played at the fairgrounds or at a dance, everyone showed up and then we'd party with the band in the desert afterwards. His music was different and ahead of it's time. Great stuff.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun little game to use your mind. like to play a couple games before bed. age old favorite that never quits.
B000002KCF|5.0|This is my favorite album- listened to it over and over in 1976 and still listen to it. All his songs sound like they could have been written yesterday- timeless. I cannot understand why he hasn't been recognized as one of the great lyricists. He captures love and life and relationships in words and music so accurately and beautifully. All his music since the 70's has been great- not a bad album ever.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|The knowledge from this book that tens or hundreds of thousands of people are going through hell on earth right now, while we lead satisfying lives is unimaginable. That Shin had no idea before he escaped of what a 'whole'life could be makes his failures once he gets out understandable. This book has been well written and I basically read it in one sitting on a plane from Sydney to LA. Even a month or more later when somone mentions that trip I immediately think of Shin and how he is right now. Please keep us up to date about his life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this trilogy! I couldn't put it down because I had to know what was going to happen next in this wonderful little love story. Of course, all the sexy juicy details were amazing as well!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved the game until it glitched. very frustrating to only be able to collect from for buildings. timers reset to over 500 hours. please fix the game.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love love love this game.  it has summer themed tiles. I could play this for hours.  well maybe not hours....but quite awhile.  if you like mahjong then this is a good app. for the whole family. enjoy! ( I know I am.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just porn wrapped up  in a fancy cover with good marketing behind it. Plus it is a book terribly degrading to women.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book!  I could not put it down.  No it is not a literary genius- but the ideas and story are great.  Our book club decided to read this due to all the hype- and it is all we can talk about!  Its a great way to get away- fantasize about new and different things- and learn where our own limits are.  At the base of it all- is a great and true love story.  If you buy this book- go ahead and buy the next two!  They are a must have to complete the story!  Relax and enjoy, download it to your iphone too- you will want to read it anywhere you get a chance!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is simple and entertaining with just the right amount of intrigue.  Each level provides a new twist but it doesn't get overwhelmingly intricate or difficult.  Plus hints are easily available if needed and presented in a way that you can learn from them.  Good puzzler and very relaxing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|to me the game is pretty cool because you get hundred and one games plus twenty four more or I ment plus twenty three more games.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I watched this after my daughter  told me to see it.  She knows my tastes very well, and has never told me to see something I did not like.  Within the first few minutes I was howling with laughter.  Honestly, I laughed the entire time this was on, and have watched it 3 times already.  I love, love, love Tucker and Dale. Their characters are both hilarious and sweet at the same time.. well, Dale is anyway.  I can't think about the scene with the chainsaw and bees without cracking a grin..  I just may have to watch it again.
1932100660|5.0|While I enjoyed the conclusions of this book - that eating a vegetable based diet and restricting calories can reduce the incidence of some chronic disease some of the anecdotes were tedious.<br /><br />I would have preferred more science, less discussion about \\"Big Medicine\\", Government regulation and other interesting but somewhat tangential topics.<br /><br />I recommend this book for its useful information about diet.  I'd advice glossing over the chapters about Big Business, Big Medicine and so on.
B007RFJ4QM|5.0|I thoght this movie was awesome im gna buy it wen it comes out!!! exciting, had me on the edge of my seat.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I love period drama and this was good, not stunning but very watchable.  Pleased that I bought it and will watch it again sometime in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! The words just flowed and weren't complicated to follow.  I fell in love with the two main characters and when I was finished with this book, I couldn't wait to read the next one in the series.
0143038419|1.0|I tried, I swear I tried to continue reading this book. But I really can't. I was expecting something much better!<br /><br />I didn't want to watch the movie until I read the book (since normally books are much better!) but I guess I will skip this ordeal and go see if the movie is least entertaining.<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought it for a quarter at the thrift store.
B007IFZU5A|4.0|I am a huge fan of Paradise Lost. I like most of their albums. The past era and the new. I have to say that my best albums are: Draconian times- One second and In requiem. Well this album sounds like something between Draconian times and In requiem. This sounds good - but there are not so catchy songs as in their past albums. The best song on this album is Crucify -> which you can downloaded it for free in their site. Its much better album than their previous one \\"Faith divides us - Death unites us\\". An album i didn't like it at all.<br />I this album you can hear very good guitars - solos -atmospheric metal as you expect. And moreover clear but aggressive vocals which sounds perfect. If you like Paradise Lost generally - then I'm sure you will like this album. On the other way its not so good as In requiem or One second.<br />4/5 stars album.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I acquired the Kindle version. Kindle had included a \\"sneak peek\\" of the first chapter as part of the purchase of the device. I read that sample and was hooked. Collins' writing style is not always the best (there are in fact some grammatical errors) but her vision of the world of Panem, the Districts, the Capitol, and the Games holds the reader's interest (at least mine) very well. Though termed a \\"young adult\\" book, it can appeal to older adults such as me who like sci-fi and fantasy fiction. I would not recommend it for the youngest ones; about age 14 would be my recommended limit due to the violence and horror described. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I wouldn't want my 8 year old granddaughter reading it. I do want to see the movie and will probably read the sequels.
B00511PTWM|2.0|The pin at the end of the unit does not have a bouncy enough give so ever time it's jolted it losses the connection. Unless you nail the thing down it's useless.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum and was singing one of their songs everywhere I went... I ordered this CD and it arrived very quickly ( before I was sick of singing the tune lol )! Very pleased :)
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This was the best season by far!  My only disappointment was that I will likely have to wait until August 2012 for season 5!!!
B007SSDS24|1.0|This was the worst movie I have seen in years.  The dialogue came out as forced 80% of the time.  the part where the boat crashed but the girl ended up a mile away in the city made no sense.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this \\"blockbuster\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love PvZ and I've bought a copy for every device I own.  Today I downloaded it for my Sony S tablet running Android 3.2.1.  The game is a little stretched side-to-side and it does slow donw on the animation between levels, but nothing bad enough to be annoying. Game play is good and grabbing and placing plants is smooth and simple.<br /><br />Downloading is simple if you follow the instructions.  I did not, so I got confusion and aggrevation, but it was all self inflicted and worked out in the end, so no harm, no foul.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good purchase and I'm sure my next purchase from the Android store will be quick and pain-free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for free! can't stop playing! grandiose love it too wish I could get more acorns without spending money. but its still fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just loved this book! Could not put it down!! It was hard enough to go thru the Hunger Games but what was to come in the near future is just mind-blowing! Hats off to the author. Look forward to reading many more of her books!!
0545265355|5.0|I haven't been much of a reader my whole life but have been trying to do it here and there for a little and I can tell you if I had books like this to read when I was in school I would have had better English grades.  These books are written in such a way as to never bore you with backstory or details in a way that derails the story line.  You get all the feelings, details, and backstory built seamlessly into the current situation keeping you tied to the story instead of reading 2 chapters about why this or that lead to what's coming and you forget what your reading about.  The chapters aren't very long but are intense and leave you wanting to go to the next one.  I averaged 10 chapters a day with these books and I think that is amazing to hold my attention in a book that long
B004TI5N38|3.0|David Baldacci is an excellent writer.  But that cannot improve the unbelievable skills of an Army police investigator.  This is way below the level of his Came Club series or King and Maxwell.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the book, was very hot. Enjoyed the characters couldn't put the book down until the end. waiting for EL James to come out with the next book!
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins knows how to craft a story.<br /><br />It's easy to lose yourself while reading, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" because the story flows so well. The settings are rich and full of just enough detail to form the image in your head, but not so much as to bore you. The characters are pretty well rounded, and this is one of the first books I've read in a while that features a very strong female lead bound not by love of a boy, but by family ties; something not seen often enough these days.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games,\\" is written for a young adult audience and as such there is a little teen love going on, so don't buy this book for your children if you're opposed to teenagers kissing.<br /><br />Don't go to see the movie before you read the book! Both are fantastic, but you'll regret not reading this wonderful book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the Kindle ap version for my iPad, which was a good thing because I couldn't put this book down.  Ok, I'm late to the Hunger Games party, but I made up for it because I bought the other two books and finished all 3 in about a week.  Super good read, super handy with the Kindle ap.
0439023513|4.0|Like the other two books in The Hunger Games series you'll find yourself having a hard time putting, \\"Mockingjay,\\" down. Fantastic characters and some pretty good plot twists are cornerstones of this series.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay,\\" wrapped up The Hunger Games series in a complete, yet slightly hurried manner. By the time the third section came along, I was bracing myself for a horrible ending; however, I was decently surprised. I think the worst part of the ending was the lack of fleshing out the ending of a few of the key characters. It leaves much to the imagination, which can be a great thing depending on how much you cared about the characters by the book's end.<br /><br />I think Monkingjay could have benefited from another 100 pages or the series as a whole could have went one more book. Regardless of the ending, it has been the best series I have read in the 2011-2012 year set.<br /><br />Good job, Suzanne Collins!
0307716546|3.0|Grace is attending a school sports event. Her 8 year old son, Adam, is competing, while her 17 year old daughter Jenny is working inside the school. When fire erupts inside the school, Grace tears inside to rescue her daughter. Both are dragged from the school, unconscious. The rest of the book is narrated by Grace from her coma in hospital. While she and Jenny are unconscious, they are able to move outside their bodies and to observe the police investigation to find out who started the fire. As it becomes apparent that someone is still trying to ensure that Jenny does not survive, the investigation takes on an increasingly desperate tone.<br /><br />This is a clever novel, part mystery, part thriller, part story of a mother realizing what her family means to her. The premise of Grace's \\"spirit\\" narrating the book takes a little getting used to. At first I thought she was dead, and I was also confused by the fact that the entire book is written as if she is talking to her husband. As a mystery, it works well. There are plenty of red herrings and a couple of genuine twists that you don't see coming. It is terribly drawn out though. The pace could have been quicker and repetitive segments either left out or trimmed. I never felt like giving up on it - I wanted to know how it would come together - but I did find some of the journey tedious. Plus I could see the ending (not the \\"whodunnit\\") coming a mile away.<br /><br />I'm tossing up between 3 and 4 stars. This is a very readable book, but ultimately I didn't feel involved enough in it. I'd recommend it, but I wouldn't classify it a \\"must read\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|A wonderfully written book that illustrates in a way young minds can firmly grasp the concepts of oppression, revolution, and the brutality of reality TV. Despite the graphic nature and violence of the novel, it shows the importance of teamwork, compassion, hope and tenacity. Loved it and sent it the hardcover version to my 12 year old niece as a gift. The kindle version was perfect for me, I was able to carry the story around with me to doctor's appointments, the park, anywhere and get my reading done on the go.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2G4TWHZKDF3QB]]This video is my first test of Opteka SteadyVid Pro stabilizer. My dog was the only subject accessible to me at the time, so she's the star of this video.<br />I had no experience using a Steadicam or similar device prior to getting this Opteka device.<br /><br />I wanted to get a low shot, so instead of hand-holding the unit, I used a boom pole with a mafer clamp attached on top, so I could get enough of an extension to get the low shot I wanted (to be on the dog's eye level). I'm by no means a skilled steadicam operator, but I'm still pretty satisfied with this camera stabilization system after the first test. I hope I will become better at using it. This weekend, I'll be shooting a friend's wedding with it.<br /><br />Update 4/27: I just created a YouTube channel where I'll be posting my progress with SteadyVid: youtube dot com/videotestground<br />Update 5/09: I just posted a guide to balancing Opteka SteadyVid at my YouTube channel (videotestground) where I discuss correct drop time, static balance and dynamic balance - it should be useful to beginning users.<br /><br />Overall, the Opteka product seems sturdy. The gimbal is very fluid and rotates easily. I can only hope that it's durable. The fine-adjustable balancing platform is very nice, although the mounting plate itself seems awfully thin. Presence of precise adjustment controls is the primary reason I chose this Opteka unit over competing designs - I was terrified that without fine-tuning option it would be a nightmare to balance the system. Even with the Opteka, It takes some work to get the system balanced properly, but I didn't find it too hard to understand how it works. The first time I did it, it took me about 20 minutes. I imagine I'll get better at balancing it with some practice.<br /><br />This is how to adjust the Opteka SteadyVid Pro:<br />To adjust bottom heaviness, you use the big knob on the body of the unit. Once you get it in the ball park, you can adjust camera positioning on the platform. For fine tuning fore and aft adjustment, you unscrew the 4 little lock bolts on the sides of the camera-mounting platform, then adjust with the bigger knob on the back of the platform. For side to side adjustment, you unscrew the four small lock bolts on the bottom of the platform and adjust with the bigger knob on the left side of the platform.<br /><br />I filmed this video with a Canon EOS Rebel t3i camera. The camera had a battery-adapter add-on on the bottom, which somewhat increased its weight. The lens was a stock Canon 18-75mm, set to 18mm for wide angle. I tried to shoot at a higher f-stop to maximize depth of field (I was on F16 or f22 for the outdoor shots, and on f8 in the forest). The ISO was set to 160 using Magic Lantern firmware modification.
0345803493|5.0|I have never written a review on ANYTHING on here but I have to say I LOVE this book.  I enjoyed it even more than the first (I didn't think that was possible)!  I don't want to give anything away (enough of that going on here) but I highly recommend it.  GO BUY NOW!  I don't want to even start Freed yet because I don't want the story to end. I'm so excited to see this on the big screen!!!
0061537934|5.0|Garth Stein has created a classic, refreshing novel. I cried so many times reading this book; Enzo really describes the pain of loss, desperation, frustration and anger in this amazingly truthful and emotional tale. This book is all about love and hope and not like your average novel about an ordinary dog. As Enzo relates; \\"I've always felt almost human. I've always known that there's something about me that's different from other dogs. Sure, I'm stuffed into a dog's body, but that's just the shell. It's what's inside that's important. The soul. And my soul is very human.\\" Fans of Marley and Me should get a copy, and some tissues.

1400069289|5.0|There are aspects of life that we don't even bother trying to understand - they just are the way they are.  The habit, one of these classic enigmas, is addressed here in an elegant study written by investigative journalist, Charles Duhigg.  The book is, indeed, an engaging investigation focused on dissecting the machinery of the habit from psychological, biological, and social aspects; it aims to make the intractable tractable through understanding.  Duhigg has written a comprehensive work, grounded firmly in science, and delivered with the readability of a page-turner.  The topics are supported by a wide breadth of relevant and fascinating case studies, which are expertly related back to the subject and how they apply to the reader's own habits, be they personal, corporate, or global.  Although the emphasis is on finding out how and why habits work, the insight is that, once we are given this information, we can consciously navigate and, therefore, change habits.  This ability has profound effects.  I enjoyed this book immensely and recommend it to anyone interested in one of our most basic behaviors, as it relates to life and business, or just for a really great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book. Well written. Great story. Great characters. I'd happily recommend this at full retail price. At this price, there is no excuse not to buy it.

B002VX0A40|5.0|My husband picked this toy for our daughter because of the large teeth on the dragon! We have an on going joke about my large smile :D We love this toy! The crinkle wings are my daughters favorite part. She also liked the mirror on the tail and the rattle. I worry that like other reviewers said about her maybe hitting herself with the rattle but I will cut it off if I see a problem. Even if I have to do that I still LOVE this toy and so does my daughter! Very cute dragon!!

B0072X2O66|4.0|I feel bad for Mike Portnoy because he keeps getting the short end of the stick.  I used to love Dream Theater, and can still listen to their first few albums over and over.  But as they became more mathematical they lost me.  Portnoy followed on the heels of Kevin Moore, leaving DT in order to branch out in different directions, and I applaud him for his courage to give up a sure thing in DT.<br /><br />Prog is my favorite genre, but I also like hard rock and Adrenaline Mob fits the bill.  Sure, it's nothing new under the sun, but it's professionally put together, has some decent songs that stand up to multiple listenings, and contains enough riffs to get me drumming my hands on the steering wheel. I agree with comparisons to Avenged Sevenfold and Metallica.  But it's not slow enough to sound like Disturbed, if you ask me, although there are tonal similarities.<br /><br />Of course, this is all my humble opinion--I'm not one of those egomaniacs who think their opinion is law.

When is he going to pop back up or did everyone just forget all about that one? I keep watching each week, hoping they will continue with the story, at least a little something here & there (like they did with gormagon), but it seems to have just been dropped. Whats up with that? Was that just supposed to be \\"the one that got away with murder\\"?

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was an excellent book.  Although it was a YA book the level of violence is significant, so this book might not be appropriate for younger readers.  I would suggest 12-13 years or older.  I really enjoyed the references to ancient Rome that were imbedded into the story line.  The capital city is Panem, which in latin means 'bread' and the Hunger Games too, seems a reference to the days of Gladiators when the Roman people would come out to watch and celebrate while men fought to the death in a large arena.  I've read this book three times and every time I discover something that I had missed previously.  Another really nice aspect to the book is the strong female lead character, Katniss.  It's refreshing to see a female heroine who is so strong.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Finally some John Mayer a guy should not feel embarrassed to admit they, not only own, but LOVE! This is modern electric blues rock at it's finest. Lyrics are meaningful, guitar is wonderful and articulate, bass jumps out at all the right times, and drums rock a beat. The fact that this album is entirely live makes a great addition. Some live albums just plain suck. This is not the case with TRY!. This album is better because it is live. Wish it was on vinyl!<br /><br />Wish one day to see another Trio album.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|I have like 3 months since I bought this CPU with a ASUS Crosshair V Formula AM3+, both are great, but I had the doubt about performance, I have the feeling the CPU could do it better, so I'd search web and I found something about windows 7 have a issue with this CPU, people is waiting for a update to solve this issue (which make go lower CPU's performance), who already tested windows 8 says the problem is solved on that OS... so I have to wait till this issue is solved on windows 7 or the windows 8 officially launches to know the real potential of this CPU...
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Train keeps surprising me with every new album. While yes most songs on the surface are a very simple pop-rock, almost every song on the album is incredibly catchy in it's own way. After listening to it the first time I had to listen again. Each time a new hint of complexity hit each and every song. This was the same with their last album, [[ASIN:B003Y01JS0 Save Me, San Francisco (Golden Gate Edition)]]. This modern Train is much better than pre-\\"Save Me\\" albums. Not only is the cover art classic and beautiful the entire album is worth every penny.<br /><br />Standout tracks on the album:<br />This'll Be My Year<br />Drive By<br />Bruises<br />50 Ways to Say Goodbye<br />You Can Finally Meet My Mom<br />Mermaid<br /><br />Train has always impressed me with their unique lyrical styling. This album is no different. Very catchy phrasing paired with meaningful, albeit sometimes silly, lyrics create a perfect layer over the basic pop and rock aspects.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its cool I liked it squirells are fun. nuts taste good like really good. so good I want some nuts right now
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It starts off slow but by the end the blood and gore that every guy wants is there. The acting by every character is flawless. Ryan Gosling plays an interesting and impressive character, eventhough he barely speaks.<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the incredibly artistic filming. Even just watching the city-scapes pass by were beautiful on blu-ray. Colors were unmatched in any recent movie I have seen, theaters or not.<br /><br />The sound for this movie is astounding. Even on my simple stereo floor speakers the immersed the room within the movie. I would love to watch this on a high quality surround sound set of speakers. Perfectly balanced and articulated sound makes up the entire movie.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy a bloody violent action movie.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until like others have stated it fails. The time it takes to accomplish anything is now over 255 HOURS for some of my stuff and everything else is more than 150 hours so I can't play. I also noticed some tasks are starting to repeat itself. I emailed support and they said they are aware of the problem and are working on a fix. I don't reccomend getting it until they have fixed the problems with it. If it's not soon then I will be uninstalling mine. Hate losing all the progress I have made but I need to make room for games I can actually play. Fun while it lasted.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|One of the best albums ever created. Carlos Santa chose excellent and unique collaborations with excellent modern musicians. With the Latin flair Santana is known for you will be a fan of it's unique melodies and rhythms from the instant he begins playing. Truly amazing from beginning to end.
1451626657|3.0|While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the \\"catch-22\\" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.<br /><br />So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?<br /><br />Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.<br /><br />Now to the real meat, the content.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.<br />If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.<br />If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.<br /><br />Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.<br /><br />I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.<br /><br />So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be \\"catched\\"!tood free enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it.

B007MC868M|5.0|Normally I read the Harry Hole serie in french but I couldn't wait the french translation for this one to come . And I did well ! What a book ... But , gosh , I hate ends likfe this , 'endings à la Hitchcock' like would say Stephen King , even if I can imagine some endings I would have liked to know the good one . I was frustrated because I wanted to know but at the same I arrived late at work because I so wanted to know it ...<br />Harry Hole is a pure Harry Hole in it , a policeman to his fingernails , I love how Jo Nesbø during all the books show that Harry is nothing more and nothing less than a policeman which makes me wonder if he's gonne be a policeman again ... I liked the fact that two girls helped him out , Beate and Martine (glad to see her again) and Rakel , his love . Harry always got along weel with women and is always respectful with them , I like the fact that he goes along well more with women than with men . I was like glad to see Rakel again , but saddened that her only son was in jail , Jo Nesbø describe well what drugs can do to a family , how a young man with a bright future can become a drug addict , waste his life and waste lives of people around him . Harry feels responsible but Oleg made his own choices ... Reading the name Fauke always make me think of the grandpa and if one day Rakel will know about her parents ...<br />I love the fact criminal affairs leave traces on Harry : in is sensitive soul and on his body . His body is becoming an open book , Harry knew what Oleg was living because he knows what cravings make you do and feel , Harry , I found , was very understanding with Oleg . I re-read some passages many times , I laughed and smiled and I cried in the end , I was saddened . It is better to have read previous books to understand it , it's been a while since I wanted something involving Oleg andf Harry helped him out . I am not disappointed , not at all<br />I like the fact that Harry is like at war with himself , always fighting his primitive instincts , feelings and body reactions . He is too much sensitive for his own good , and have to much conscience<br />I liked the Bellman parts and wondered through the book what was his role in all this , I liked , too Truls Bernsten and I am impatient to see Harry putting his nose in all this mess , I liked the Harry Hole vs Tom Waller and hope to see next time an Harry Hole vs Mikael Bellman ! He is like an eel , he is ambitious , if Harry feels to much cases he works on Mikael feels nothing . He is just concern about himself , a face to face between those two men should be interesting<br />I disliked Gato and liked the conversations between Harry and Cato . During all the book I wondered if Oleg was guilty or not , some names appear during it and many people had reasons to shoot Gusto . I was totally dragged into the story , the end made me sad and begged for more . Harry Hole is more than ever a classic detective , a man with a huge heart but with too much principles for being happy<br />Thank you Mr Jo Nesbø for this one , I am waiting impatiently for the next one !
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I think for those that are dissing the Director's cut, they're upset because they've seen the standard release so many times, that that is really all they WANT to see. Anything more, or less, is considered sacrilege. I left those thoughts behind me while watching and came out with an appreciation for the full Darko experience.<br /><br />Liked:<br /><br />- The talk between father and son about dealing with other's preconceptions of who you should be, and how full of BS many people are<br /><br />- The book overlays that preceded new scenes... gave a sense of fatality, that this path was hard-wired somehow... as Donnie once stated, he felt it was \\"God's Plan\\"<br /><br />- The statement at the end how some might recall events that happened in the tangent timeframe, brought forward into the current... did not recall this in theatrical cut. It gave a sense that what was done in the tangent timeframe wasn't for nothing. It also gives the sense that Donnie Darko was a metaphorical modern Jesus Christ, dyeing for their sins and then giving them a second chance to change things in the proper timeline.<br /><br />Disliked:<br /><br />- The checkerboard pattern and fireworks scene... only thing I felt was a bit overdone<br /><br />Considering the Blu-Ray release contains both the standard and Director's cut, fans get to watch the version they prefer. So in that sense, I give this disc, and movie, 5 stars.

B004XIZK5K|5.0|Im not going to go into detail on what a great workout you can get from kettlebells, im sure you already have read all about it, or why would you be reading the review for this book?<br />But i will tell you, i have no regrets in getting this book and dvd.  These are the first kettlebell publications you should get if you are a beginner.  Pavel will take you from the very basics, having you get your body ready for kettlebell training, and then into some of the core movements.  He breaks everything down into several simple moves.  Some people have complained that there are no specific workout routines provided.  Yes, there are a couple.  They are very simple, and are meant to be building blocks to get you into kettlebells without hurting yourself.  Ive had no problems coming up with my own routines and havent been lacking at all.  Eventually, once the moves in the book are mastered, i plan on getting the RKC book.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Its a good book, sometimes a little dense, but a great continuation of a story that is really exciting. can't wait for the next book!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very enjoyable read, no matter your age.  I enjoyed reading all three books and look forward to the upcoming movies too.
0345803485|4.0|I give this a \\"four star\\" simply because its a fast read, and was entertainment while recuperating from a nasty virus (so I read all three).  I have to admit, after a while I had to skip through some of the sexual \\"encounters\\" as it was simply boring after the first or second tryst.<br /><br />Now for the elephant in the living Room. The entire so-called romance is built upon an abusive relationship!  H E L L O ! !  He is a Narcissist in every sense of the word; controlling, domineering, has no empathy, \\"likes\\" to punish her for various reasons - she is trying to maintain autonomy and does so poorly, feels she is unworthy and many times feels she \\"deserves\\" the treatment at his hands because \\"she didn't listen\\" to him.  The \\"cycle of abuse\\" is glaring.  But what does she know...it's her first and only love, so there is no reference point. OK, sure, this is just a novel (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  However, this is 2012 and women in abusive relationships are just starting to receive some recognition! Instead of using this book as a vehicle to educate women, the author gives the reader the impression that Narcissism is OK and tolerated, it can also be fixed.  IT CANNOT!  Clearly, the author has enough research to portray this character's personality disorder correctly, right down to the messed up childhood that caused the abusive tenancies.  Had she researched the other end of this, she may have educated readers in her epilogue to the fact that alcoholism (he is also an alcoholic by admission), is more easily cured than his personality disorder and their life (as well as their children's) will be nothing but a holy hell. Less than three percent of men like this can ever change - even with cogitative therapy.  Put THAT in your epilogue, James!<br /><br />It's a shame there will be a mistaken idea built from this, that Narcissism and abuse can be fixed by just simply loving someone and knowing \\"they didn't mean it\\".  If it were that easy, shrinks and divorce attorney's would be out of work.

Then it was updated again on April 29, 2012 - now up to version 2.0.4  This could be why so many people are having problems - the app has had many fixes and we have not gotten them.  I wrote to the developer TWICE and hopefully he will send the updated app to be tested by Amazon - then Amazon will offer us the update to download.<br /><br />May 1, 2012 - I received a reply from the developer today and he states that the update has been sent in to Amazon for review today.  So in a few days the update should appear on here for us to download/update.<br /><br />June 30, 2012  -  Contacted developer about newest update a few days ago - app is up to version 2.1.1 - developer told me update has been sent to Amazon for review - so it should be here soon for us to download/update.

B0071R43MG|5.0|Typically, I am not a huge fan of live DVD's or CD's.  You can't capture the feeling of \\"being there\\" in an audio or video recording; you just can't.  And, I prefer a live performance in which the artist attempts to recreate the music faithfully, or when they play it differently they are at least doing it purposefully.  There are bands that equal Joe's live performances (Rush comes to mind) but I've never seen anyone better him.<br /><br />Yes, the Paris DVD is horrid; don't buy it.  This one is terrific.  And, if you (like me) don't care much for live CD's or DVD's (blu-ray) buy this anyway, because it's as good a recording as any studio effort.  Of course you can tell it's live, but think of it as a compilation of great Satch songs.  The thing that always blows me away about Joe is how good he plays live.  He's the real deal (for those of you who haven't seen him) in the music world.<br /><br />The extras are cool too.  Basically, it's Joe and the band goofing around in the studio and backstage.  Fun for Joe fans to see, I think, but casual music lovers probably wouldn't care about the extras.<br /><br />If you are just browsing music videos, looking for a top notch performance to impress you, just buy it.  BTW, bought it yesterday at Best Buy for $12.99...no waiting for delivery, fyi.

0312360266|2.0|Beginning of this book, I suddenly started imagining it as a movie, and a comedy at that, from the combination of over the top stereo types and randomness. That made it kind of fun for a while, but got old about halfway through. Still, I really think someone should make a movie, using only quotes from the book; it would be hilarious.<br /><br />But I will admit, there is very little redeeming about this book otherwise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so cute and fun. I just got a kindle fire and found this game. its like super Mario brothers with a twist.
0345803485|1.0|This has got to be the worst example of a BDSM novel ever. At best, this will make a housewife take their \\"inner goddess\\" to the local stripper store or Adult Mart looking for some fetish items.  Yay for them, but it's books like these that ruin good sexual fetishism. If you want fantasy BDSM, read Anne Rice's Beauty series. Close to real BDSM, read Molly Weatherfield's dual set \\"Carrie's Story\\".  I also have a problem with baiting the \\"Twilight\\" type crowd into a sexual subject so poorly written. Hollywood will turn this into a very bad NC-17 movie. Such a shame considering that movies made for adults were making a nice little comeback. When the media can make Dr. Drew panic-diagnose this book, and Dr. Oz devote an entire show to it, you KNOW someone somewhere got it all wrong. That someone is E L James.
B0001I561E|3.0|I purchased this Aladdin movie for my daughter as we are trying to replace her old VHS Disney movies with DVD's. Turns out that this one seems to be a bootleg copy. Yes, it came in an Aladdin box plastic wrapped but when she went to play it the other day, the dvd player would not read it right. It would only read on her PS2. She researched it and there seems to be no code on it like all the other dvd's that are Disney movies.<br />I'm disappointed that it seems to be bootleg but sometimes I guess people are wanting to make money. It works but not as it should. I will end up replacing it but with one that is more connected with Amazon.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Move over, Hunger Games! This was a great read! I found it to be well written, thought provoking, and engrossing. The characters are well developed and relatable. Don't miss this one! (I took one star off my review simply because it felt to me that it wasn't until the second book that the story really got cookin') I heard there is a 6th book out, which is good because I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Excellent movie with outstanding cast. The title does not do justice to the book. This is an excellent murder mystery solved by research investigators. Movie moves quickly and I can't wait for the sequels.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|Game is really fun and addicting. The only issue I have is that my coin balance always changes. When I return the game says that I earned 68000 while away and then my balance only show like 34000. don't know if anyone else has had that issue.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I love this game but unfortunately It did not download. I have played this game on my iPhone and I loved it. Maybe your luck is better... if it works for you I hope you guys have fun playing. IT is worth a shot

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are few books that captive my attention than than than this  book.  I am reading the next book. My only regret is that I have no more more time on my break at work.  Well written, captivating, you appreciate Katniss, love her, admire her, wish we have more of her moxy in our ourselfs.  Highly recommed
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I usually don't do reviews but my son begged me to review this and give it 5 stars. he loves it
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The other reviews are pretty accurate, this is a very enjoyable series of books. The first book of this omnibus is a short read, but ends with a twist that makes you want to keep reading. I found the second book to be a little slow, and less thrilling but it does a great job of painting a picture of the world the characters live in. I think I enjoyed the third book the best. The books are well written and some of the scenes in the stories are very intense. The characters are interesting. At the end of the books, I didn't feel too excited to read the sixth book (which I thought wasn't available yet). Not because the last book in this omnibus is bad, but just because it didn't \\"hook\\" me. I thought \\"hmm, what more could there be to look forward to?\\". To my suprise I saw the 6th book on sale and bought that one as well, and will write a review. It starts out really interesting, and I think I'll enjoy it as well! So I'd definitely recommend this omnibus edition to fans of science fiction, it is excellently priced as well!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety, you earn coins to unlock other games. some of the games are just okay while others were fun. not the best graphics but doesn't detract from game play.
0307956350|4.0|In the spirit of Stieg Larsson, we have a strong female narrator and a high level of ambience and suspense.  I have not been able to put this book down and am eager for another, particularly if Kate Moore continues her adventures.  I gave one fewer than five stars only because this is not a book I would categorize as great literature but I do rank it high in its genre.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I have cut the rope on my iphone and I luv it 'cause I can play it any time any place
B00275EGWY|5.0|For those who haven't been down range I can't suggest this movie enough. I was an Army HUMINT specialist in Baghdad and this movie can gets to me like nothing else. The dull sandy surroundings, creeping terror at every step and the urge of panic with every action this move goes beyond any other when it comes to a dose of unflinching reality.<br /><br />The mundane approach captivates when you first see it. I remember how routine it seemed to be deployed then a few mortars and IEDs made the experience far more humbling. Walking around a market changed. Saying hello changed. Taking a step without worrying changed. The movie gives you that horror and intimacy at the same time. I still have nightmares about Iraq and this film in an odd way soothes that. I remember working with EOD and the sheer terror operating around them. Cellphones didn't escape your gaze, wrong looks didn't go unchecked. All perfectly captured on film.<br /><br />If you can't sleep after watching this movie the first time then it did its job. I still can't go a month without hearing mortars and seeing dead bodies.<br /><br />The lingo is sound (ish, there are some flaws) still hearing a redneck yell \\"imshi\\" brings me back. I can't tell you the fear of operating a 50 cal the first time. You're parylized and just hoping militia doesn't sense it. One thing though, don't smoke when you've left the wire unless you want to get shot. Oh, and eyepro is a must but aside from that I abandoned my disbelief to the point of panic. Hell, I even wore a shemagh just like the movies. Didn't know it looked cool, it just kept dust out of my mouth.<br /><br />Granted, Iraq will be a distant memory soon enough bu this is a movie I'll watch and watch over again to at least think that the sacrifices made weren't in vain.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|reminds  me of the original mario..... i really like it. its addictive once I started playing I couldn't put it down.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|Sherlock Holmes has always been a favorite not only because of the stories but also because of the flowing use of language that Conan Doyle uses. Nowadays unless you are a kid the stories are hardly new having been interpreted , reinterpreted, tributed, and spoofed but still it's great to read the delightfully archaic \\"Thank you for so being so miraculously present in our time of need\\" in a era of \\"kthxbye\\".
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a lot of fun<br />it is is is is the worlds best game ever oh yeah tooooo toot man uh huh that is right
B000SEGCRS|5.0|I got my first DSLR camera and I was not familiar with the technical bits nor the different ways to composite photographs. This book is very easy to read and great to use as a starting point. This book make me enjoy my camera a lot more as I followed the steps when I went out photographing in my surroundings. When it comes to the author´s humor I can understand the other reviews here on Amazon. However, it does not take up much space and the content of the book is very enjoyable to read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is so awesome it is so cool I just want to keep playing it but it kind of copies Super Mario Bros.
B0071R43MG|5.0|First of all, if you haven't seen [[ASIN:B00005NGA2 Joe Satriani - Live in San Francisco]], purchase it immediately and watch it before you watch this!  LISF is a must for any true Satch fan and is a building block for the rest of the Satriani DVD collection.  Now, about Satchurated.  As the title says, I truly feel that this release rivals the San Fran DVD.  We all know what happened with [[ASIN:B0030BYWI2 Joe Satriani: Live in Paris - I Just Wanna Rock]]; there is none of that here.  The only special effects you will see are those that are on the stage behind the band, which, if you are watching in 3D are very cool.  The Blu-Ray comes with ONE (1) disc that plays in 3D if you have a 3D setup, or 2D if you have a 2D setup.  Joe's switch to Marshall Amps reveals a very sweet (read: awesome!), and at times crunchy, gritty, and especially noticeable during the intro track: Ice 9, very scorching and searing tone for this film.  If you thought he had it nailed with the Peavey JSX, you've got another thing comin'!  This is also Joe's first film since LISF to feature a devoted keyboardist, and the addition of Mike Kennealy in that role adds a huge dimension to the band by adding tasty fills to the old tracks and especially the new ones.  Going back to the video side of things, there are no sudden, seizure inducing camera or angle changes as is the case with so many concert films these days.  Don't get me wrong, you won't be staring at the same image for too long, but the changes are very pleasant and easy on the eyes, and add to the \\"experience of being at the concert\\".  For all of us hardcore Joe fans, there are plenty of close-ups of Joe's fingers, so don't fret- pun intended.  For that matter, there are actually a few close-ups of every band member at some point.  This is just an overall excellently filmed, excellently played gig that turned in to an excellently produced concert film.  I gave this 5 stars because I couldn't give it 10.  Anything I missed?  Feel free to leave comments.  For the complete 25 track listing, see [[ASIN:B0071BY084 Satchurated: Live In Montreal]].leave comments.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and I wish more people would play it so I could have many neighbors!  kids would really love this game too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Reminds of the game we used to play on giant desktop computers in school-I liked it then and I like it now!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this book and didn't really want to read it.  Then I decided to buy it and see for myself, not only could I not put it down, but I devoured all three books!  Thank you Amazon!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Please note I saw this on TV so I can't comment on the Ultra-Violet digital copy issue many people have had.<br /><br />For fun, mindless entertainment this is my pick for the season. This latest in the super hero genre just punches up the beautiful visuals and special effects along with a story that is both campy and serious. It catapults you into an outrageous future world of Old Ones who are billions of years old who protect the galaxy using the Green Lanterns as their super agents, a galaxy with thousands of sentient races, a universe of fantastic mentalistic abilities and fantastic science, and an evil super dude who can shred a whole planet for lunch. Yikes.<br /><br />It's just pure mindless fun and suitable for the whole family. The script, acting, direction, and editing were all fine. It's the sort of movie to just sit back with a beer and popcorn on a lazy weekend night and just forget about the rest of the world for a couple of hours. If a movie can do that for me these days I'm a happy camper, and this one did just fine on that account.
B0043X1FL8|4.0|Penny Marshall did a very good job in bringing this difficult story to film.  She has chosen an amazing cast:  Robert deNiro is hearbreaking in the role of an afflicted man who comes back to life after being in a vegetative state for thirty years, falls in love and then sinks back into the illness.  Not knowing about the story I expected a happy Hollywood ending and so this was sad and difficult to watch.  However one is left with a sense of the goodness of the dedication of the doctor and the staff who gave so much love to these patients.<br /><br />Besides the always winning DeNiro, Robin Williams delivers a strong performance as the heroic doctor.  Personally I'm a little tired of Williams' roles as kindly doctors, teachers, psychiatrists, etc....but he does a good job at them.  I loved Julie Kavner (Valerie Harper's younger sister in \\"Rhoda\\") who always manages to convey great heart.  John Heard is wonderful, too, as the slimey chief doctor who opposes the methods of Williams.  Penelope Ann Miller is amazingly lovely in a small but important role.  The scene in which she asks DeNiro to dance is one of the best in the film.<br /><br />This isn't a feel good film but it is certainly worth watching.
0345803493|2.0|but, this doesn't even come close to book 1. Since I read. And I mean, I read a lot, I have a sense that this is not such a great author. Why? Because the story line from book 1 is fanfic from Twilight. Fine. I'm fine with that. Some get their undies in a bundle, but I don't. I loved the first book! But you see it allll fall apart in book 2. I'm not surprised at the 5 star reviews as most people want light, bubblegum, fast reads. That's what this is. But there was sooooo much potential here and I feel it's gone to waste. What started as a tantilizing, suspenseful book in book 1, fell very flat in book 2. All the cheery, romantics at heart will think this book is good. Me? Well, since I read everything under the sun, this book is plain old boring and predictable and could have been so, so much more. My main issues? Predictable. Every sex scene ends with him yelling out her name. He turns vanilla even though he's spent his whole life doing S+M. Ana starts out a strong woman turned completely docile in book 2. My biggest issue????<br /><br />Both characters completely, completely change in book 2. This bears repeating. Critically think about this book people. Yes, it's a light read, but it's not 5 star material! Ana turns docile and Christian's sex turns vanilla. That's fine IF the first book never happened, but it did and now the author is telling a completely diff story. This book should have been about how he gets to wanting the vanilla sex and normal life. Not just that it happened bc she left him for 5.freaking.days. Come ON people!<br /><br />Imagine if this was the first book out. Think it would be getting a movie deal? I don't think so. I would like to retitle this as \\"The Story of Makebelieve\\" where a multimillionaire has time to follow his girlfriend around (that's what you pay others to do FYI), can fly everything, buys anything, and changes his personality completely for a woman he's known for a few weeks. Oh, plenty of time to house hunt and maybe wants kids? Just doesn't happen people.
0439023513|2.0|I'd say the series as a whole was very good until the last 100 pages of this book.  The ending is incomplete, lacks depth and is predictable.  It almost like the author got towards the end of the series and gave up.  It angers me to get so involved in the characters of the series only to have an unsatisfying completion.  Definitely staying away from Suzanne Collins in the future.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I found this second book much better than the first one with more suspense. It continues to develop Lisbeth's character and the secondary characters are more interesting. Don't mess with that gal gentlemen!Larsson spent a lot of time tieing up loose ends at the end of Tattoo, here the action pounds till the very end, causing you to .....buy the third one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I lt is so fun.<br />I like the graphics and the gameplay<br />I hope you make a second game.
0439023513|2.0|I found that the ideas I liked and the thought provoking parts of the book were also the more predictable. Some reflections are: 'all means for an end'? what is the balance between caring for your own and caring for the society in general? Can fight a monster turn you into a monster? These are the themes that occur to me right now. The depressing ending was for me a foregone conclusion. I could not see how the story would end well.<br /><br />I did not like the book in general, I skimmed , but maybe at first less than I did skim in book 2.<br /><br />Character development... hmm, I think I saw more flat revelations of facts about characters or sharp twists (if you read it you know...) than well worked development.<br /><br />I found myself not caring much for the way Katniss explains her dilemmas, sufferings, you name it. It seemed to me that it was as though someone described brutal events with the wording and emotional colour that you would picture a girl complaining about how her classmates shun her. And everything is repeated so often, it loses effect.<br /><br />The endless summaries of how she feels about the prepping team, or how she has nightmares, feel a bit like diary entries rather than stream of conciousness or a real narrative of the main events. Perhaps it is best so, and perhaps it is done to capture the inner voice of a relatively uneducated 17 y/o.<br /><br />I found the psychology and the dilemmas faced by Katniss mostly bland in form, brutal in content, and I think that the brutality of the content is meant as a means to drive the point home or to spice up the bland fare.<br /><br />If this had been more adult, there'd been none of the prudishness about sex that I sensed. Well, the only depart from prudishness is ... if you read it you know. And the scene in particular is bland in language, brutal in abstract terms, not descriptive of the psychological state of the character but mainly telling blandly. As it was told blandly, the content had to bemade more brutal in a schematic way.
B000AYELVA|5.0|2000's X-Men, directed by Bryan Singer, could have gone wrong on so many levels, and while it does have some minor flaws here and there, I still find it one of the best cinematic interpretions of a comic book property ever produced. I am a major Marvel fanatic, and I love the X-Men in particular. The notion of a group of superhumans born, or \\"cursed\\" depending on the various points of view, with their special abilities is always an intriguing one, and comics writer/creator Stan Lee set up such a unique legend with the whole intolerance/racism angle most humans have against the mutant population on Earth. Some mutants, such as Professor Charles Xavier, a telepath and founder of the X-Men team of adventurers, want to teach understanding and acceptance for mutants and humans alike, while others, like Magneto, who can control magnetism and was a prisoner of the Nazi death camps, view humans as scum to be ruled over by \\"Homo Superior\\".<br /><br />The film follows the character of Logan/Wolverine, well played by then newcomer Hugh Jackman, as he reluctantly joins our heroes in a quest to stop the villianous Magneto (a strong, compelling Ian McKellan) and his Brotherhood of Mutants (The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the comic books) from using a machine that would turn all humans into mutants...to \\"even us out\\".<br /><br />The story couldve been beefed up in some aspects, yet this was just the first intro to the mythology on-screen, and it still works; some flaws I had a little trouble with included the notion of the great villian Sabretooth (here played by Tyler Mane) being somewhat subservient to Magneto, sort of like a brainless henchman. If you know the character from the comics, Sabretooth is one of the most vile, cold blooded and actually quite intelligent and cunning supervillians ever created. Rounding out the bad guys is Mystique (played by Rebecca Romajn Stamos), a murderous shapeshifter, and Toad (Ray Park), who has incredible agility and a whip-like tongue.<br /><br />In the X-Men, we have Cyclops (James Marsden), the leader, who shoots destructive energy beams from his eyes, though his curse is he cant control them without a ruby quartz visor to wear, Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) a telepath/telekinetic, Storm, whose screen characterization could have been beefed up as well as Cyclop's since they are two of the most compelling characters of the group, is played by Halle Berry. She can manipulate the elements (rain, wind, etc). Rounding it out is Rogue (Anna Paguin), whose mutant ability involves touching and absorbing the physical abilities of those around here, sometimes with dire consequences. The great Patrick Stewart plays Prof Xavier. He brings a quiet, understated fatherly authority to the film, and his presence is felt even when hes not on screen.<br /><br />Jackman does a very good job as Wolverine, and it makes you wonder how farther he can go with it, since Wolverine is by far one of the most fun, complex and challenging antiheroes in comics. Personally I felt Jackman was a tad too tall for the role, but he does bring a surly, belligerant yet noble and heroic attitude to Wolverine, which feels right if you know what the character is all about psychologically.<br /><br />The SFX are good but dont overwhelm the story and characters, and Singer directs with a moody, dark vision that thankfully doesnt play down the world these complicated characters inhabit, and actually takes this storyline seriously. \\"X-Men\\" works very well indeed with what it has to begin with./><br />In the X-Men, we have Cyclops (James Marsden), the leader, who shoots destructive energy beams from his eyes, though his curse is he cant control them without a ruby quartz visor to wear, Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) a telepath/telekinetic, Storm, whose screen characterization could have been beefed up as well as Cyclop's since they are two of the most compelling characters of the group, is played by Halle Berry.

0446572993|2.0|I've enjoyed the other Baldacci books and bought this one with great anticipation.  Baldacci is a good writer and this book is also well written.  I was disappointed with the plot of this one, however.  In summary, it didn't hang together and was not believable.

030758836X|5.0|\\"But I know I'll never sleep again. I can't close my eyes when I'm next to her. It's like sleeping with a spider.\\" - Nick Dunne<br /><br />\\"Isn't that what every marriage is, anyway? Just a lengthy game of he-said, she-said?\\" - Amy Elliott Dunne<br /><br />GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn is a deliciously unnerving novel of a marriage gone badly askew.<br /><br />The plot begins \\"the day of\\" as bar owner Nick Dunne discovers his wife has disappeared when, after being telephoned by a neighbor that his home's front door is open and Bleecker the cat is sitting on the front porch, he returns to find wife Amy gone. There are signs of a struggle in the living room. Thus begins Nick's half of the first-person narrative.<br /><br />Alternating with segments of Nick's tale are entries from Amy's diary beginning seven years previous in 2005.<br /><br />The two timelines eventually merge.<br /><br />The first half of GONE GIRL is a riveting Who-Dunne-It. Then, that question answered, the last half is a fascinating exercise in subdued dread - perhaps that same disbelieving unease felt when, purely by chance, you notice a cold and calculating look directed your way by the spouse when he/she is slicing a piece of raw meat with a razor-sharp knife. You thought you knew him/her so well. And maybe he/she knows you too well.<br /><br />What makes GONE GIRL so good, besides the ingeniously rendered intrigue, is the fact that it's not so farfetched. After all, who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men ... and women. As you consider your wife or husband, can you be certain of your continuing safety in the presumed sanctuary of the home you've made together? Is the Trojan Horse the Beamer he/she drives into the garage at night?

0812992792|1.0|I purchased this book because it received such high ratings.  I finished this book because I kept thinking it had to get better.  I actually read another book before finishing it because I had to take a break - a first for me.  It was painfully tedious to read, the storyline was like following a cow meandering through a pasture and it didn't get better.  Feeling disappointed and angry for the hours I wasted when there are so many great books to read.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The main advantage of this adapter for me is that it works with the newest Mac OSX versions. The previous version did not.<br /><br />Other than that, the main advantage of these adapters over built-in WiFi adapters is the higher sensitivity when used with an external antenna. You can use them with directional (Yagi) or \\"omni\\" directional (torus beam) antennas with 12, 16, even 19 dBi of gain. with such an antenna, you will be amazed at the much larger number of sites you can see, or how far you can reach your own node if you have a large property - in clear terrain distances like a mile are possible.<br /><br />Don't be mislead by the 2 watts, however - more transmit power does not help you receive any better - as the adage goes - if you can't hear them, you can't work them. Still, this is the highest power USB adapter on the market, and its receiver is very good.

0061433063|3.0|I have really loved all the Tiffany Aching books...until this one. And this one isn't bad or anything; it just isn't as good as I expected.<br /><br />The basic problem I had with this book is that it reverts Tiffany's story to a Monster of the Week format (something we very pleasingly got away from in Wintersmith). Worse yet, it simplifies the very complex problem of human prejudice into a magical monster.<br /><br />There's a LOT to like in this story. Eskarina Smith (not seen since Equal Rites?) makes a fascinating bit appearance. And Tiffany appears to be getting attached to a young man who is far more her equal than Roland could ever be. This book also delves into some painful real-world problems like child abuse. But all of that simply doesn't make up for the overall plotting and thematic issues.

B007MG360G|5.0|i must admit that i liked it but this one left me wanting more to do with it. make more please!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I did like this book much more than I did \\"Under the Dome\\" but have decided I will no longer be interested in purchasing and reading any other book of his that even hints at being such a long novel. This one could have been an excellent book at about 400 pages. I understand the premise of the story and the lead up to the finale, but for goodness sake do we have to follow the day to day monologue of what George is doing, thinking, wearing, observing, etc...? This book just went on and on and on with nonsense. It was like reading a very long and very boring daily diary. So much useless drivel that at a little over the halfway mark, I confess that I started skimming. Even then I don't feel as though I missed anything. I truly had to fight the urge to skip to the end to see if I wanted to finish the book. I resisted and did finish.<br /><br />I truly love his work and have since I read my first book of his but these last two were painful to read. It's not the length that bothers me because my favorite book is The Stand.(Which by the way, I just read again.) It is the content of the books that has changed. The heart and soul of his writing style has changed. What used to grip me by the hair and hang on until the last page was read is now something I can't wait to get over with.<br /><br />Sorry Mr. King! I know that I am in the minority of the reviewers but as a long time fan, this one just didn't cut it. Maybe I'll like the next book better. (hoping that it's not over 500 pages.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" after noting that it topped the NY Times Bestseller List and that its two sequels were also top 5 on the list.<br /><br />There are a few points to note:<br /><br />1. This book is the epitome of literotica. Do not let the cover entice you into believing otherwise. Instead, let the image of the tie make your imagination run wild.<br /><br />2. This is one of the most tedious books I've read. I had to force myself to turn each page with each erotic scene becoming more boring and sterile as the book progresses.<br /><br />3. The writing is poor. I was repeatedly forced to hear the main character refer to her \\"inner goddess\\". Seriously?<br /><br />4. Finally, if you hated Twilight do NOT read this. I actually thought Twilight was more entertaining. Don't get me wrong- I'm not saying Meyer's writing was better, I'm just saying that Twilight held my attention much more. In \\"Grey\\" one is forced to deal with a personality-less Christian Grey and a sexually inexperienced Anastasia Steele who becomes sexually awakened at the hands of Grey. And yes, that essentially sums up the storyline. While reading, I had several Bella/Edward-esque flashbacks. A mediocre looking Anastasia falls head over heels for billionaire Grey for no discernible reason other than his apparently captivating looks. However, it's not love per se, but more of an intense obsession with neither Grey nor Ana having any real personality, charm or wit. Similarly to Bella being forced to keep Edward's secret, Ana is contractually bound to keep Grey's \\"guilty pleasures\\" or more aptly, his affinity for BDSM.<br /><br />It was only post-reading, I discovered that this novel was born as a Twilight fan fiction ebook then rapidly spread with its \\"mommy porn\\" appeal as so accurately stated by the NY Times. Go figure.<br /><br />FYI- This crap is actually going to be made into a movie. For those with built up tension, go channel your inner goddess!

B000002UB2|5.0|This album has gotten really great and detailed reviews obviously, but for me, this was the very first LP I ever bought. I had just bought a new turntable and getting my feet wet in the world of music records. This album laid it open and it was clear why people still buy turntables and records instead of digital music. Of course, everybody has different tastes in music, but it is hard to see how you could go wrong with The Abbey Road.

0071752854|5.0|I am a student entrepreneur participating in a business plan competition run by a local non-profit agency. I used the principles laid out by Oren Klaff in this book to make my finalist pitch as well as during a networking session of the program. While my presentation did not rank high, the networking session was highly fruitful. I convinced one person to make a small investment and two other leads. It came highly recommended from a fellow entrepreneur and I highly recommend it for everybody. It is a quick read and easy to grasp. Some of the ideas listed may seem naive or over-simplified at first but you will soon realize how a lot of us take these ideas for granted and ruin our pitches!<br /><br />Awesome book in all regards ! Kudos and Thanks for Oren Klaff!!
0553801473|2.0|In my opinion, the writing of DwD almost seemed to say, \\"These people will take whatever crumbs I toss at them and love it; I am GRRM!\\"  To which *I* say, \\"Look, you ingrate, for YEARS I practically shoved your dang books down the throats of friends, family, and complete strangers.  I defended you whenever anyone complained about the ridiculous length of time between books.  I lauded your Seven Kingdoms in all the different kingdoms to which we traveled.  I started a SoIaF group, that we might discuss this series that we loved.  I spent oodles of cash on your books for myself and as gifts for others.  I supported your website and listened to your interviews.  I convinced people who couldn't stand the fantasy genre to read your words.  I did all of this, and THIS is how you repay me?<br />By writing a book from which you seemed too far away?  By worshiping at the altar of HBO, as your books took a back burner to the series?  By complaining that we who don't LOVE every word written by your royal hand are sock puppets?  By making it seem like your own importance now outweighs the love of your earliest fans?\\"  Remember us?  We are your earliest fans... the people who read your first book, then your second, etc, and it is we who ultimately helped you to this throne on which you currently sit.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I have read the first four books of the ASoIaF series many times over (starting in the late '90's) as I waited for the next book to come out, then the next book, etc.  I happily reread those first three books (again!) as I awaited FfC, re-living each profound event of the series as if I were discovering it for the first time, which speaks to the phenomenal writing of those First Three.<br /><br />When FfC was finally published, I was there first thing in the morning, waiting impatiently to grab the goods, rush home, and then to devour the book with glee!  Then, when I was finished reading...<br /><br />It was okay...  But that was acceptable tome; the next book was BOUND to be better.  It was BOUND to recapture the magic and continue the legacy that GRRM had created.  So, as MORE YEARS went by, I waited impatiently yet again, checking his web page for updates like a maniac, asking everyone at my local bookstore if they'd heard anything yet, participating in online forums to help pass the time.  Until, finally, finally, DwD was released.  Once again I was first in line to get the next book of my beloved series.  I carted it home and immediately began to read.<br /><br />Two months later I was finished.  To be clear: I am a very fast reader, depending on how much I'm enjoying the book that I'm holding.  In other words, I was so disappointed in DwD that it was almost painful to force myself to finish reading it.  I barely recognized many of the characters that I loved, and I kept waiting for the story to progress enough to recapture my attention, but it was as though GRRM was writing from a far off tower constructed from his overabundance of hubris.  I promised myself that I would only write my review after reading it a second time, but my bookmark sits idle somewhere around page 400.  I just can't finish it this time.<br /><br />So, sadly, I not only can't recommend A Dance with Dragons, I also can no longer defend my once-favorite author.  I can only hope that he hears us, and goes on a legitimate quest for the magic of the First Three.

1594203334|4.0|I was interested in reading this book even though my husband and I don't have any human children, only furry ones. I was interested in light of different cultures compared.<br /><br />I mostly liked the book because it did give much detail into the French daily life, although I often found the authoress very repetitive. So much so that I believe the book could have been half it's size. She would take one point from her research and seemingly try to reassure it with every dot and tittle.<br /><br />I also believe that the authoress' view of American parenting is very myopic. Because she showed more than one way Parisan parenting was adapted around her, it would have been nice to have more than one way that American parenting is lived. From her stories it felt like all the American women she knew, were haphazard in the same way.<br /><br />At the same time, though I would suggest it to anyone interested in European culture. And would try to find a way to introduce it to many parents, politely.
B004SEUJVO|5.0|Well, I'll be darned.  This film was a very nice surprise.  An engagingly funny, intelligent, and warm comedy that, while not above a bawdy joke or two, still manages to present characters that feel substantial and real.  I wish I'd seen it sooner.<br /><br />I don't know quite what I was expecting with this film - though I suspect I had visions of past films like \\"Superbad,\\" \\"Pineapple Express,\\" and \\"Knocked Up\\"; which is to say, broadly funny films that had heart but also a fairly good deal of raunchy humor.  I enjoyed them all, in a modest way, but I've also recently begun to grow a bit weary of that style. (Call it the Judd Apatow formula of comedy - `Mucho raunchiness + heart.')<br /><br />So, unwilling to plunk down a chunk of change to buy a movie that I had vague doubts about, I checked \\"Adventureland\\" out from my local library some two weeks before actually watching it.  I'd keep eyeing the movie's casing as it sat there on the shelf by my television, day after day, before opting to watch something else (or even, god help me, grabbing a book).  But last night, I broke down - for I had little else to do (well, that and the fact that my librarians were practically begging for me to bring the movie back); I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The director, Greg Mottola (who also made the \\"Superbad\\"), opts to skip a majority of the raunchy humor this time around (though there is a repeated gag about one kid hitting another in the unmentionables) for a brand of humor that is a little more subtle.<br /><br />As other reviews have noted, this film is definitely not \\"Superbad\\" - even though it was marketed in a manner that suggested the two films were very much the same.  Where \\"Superbad\\" was a raunchy, if sweet-natured, film about the adolescent transition between high school and college, \\"Adventureland\\" is a quieter, slightly more contemplative film - apt, given that it is about lost, wayward, and awkward twentysomethings transitioning from college into real life.  The jokes here grow more from the comedy of human longing and emotion than they do from bodily function.<br /><br />The cast is first rate - in some cases, surprisingly so.  Jesse Eisenberg, whom I had already seen in \\"Zombieland\\" and \\"The Social Network\\" - seems to have cornered the market on playing socially awkward roles.  He does it well, but here adds in a nice tinge of sweetness to his lead role of James.  He is genuinely believable as a smart kid with large dreams who is somewhat surprised to find himself working at a seedy amusement park.  Ryan Reynolds turns in a solid, nicely underplayed performance as a local lothario, and - quell surprise - Kristin Stewart proves her detractors wrong by turning in a skilled performance as an emotionally troubled kid who falls for Eisenberg.  As a bonus, \\"Freaks and Geaks\\" alum Martin Starr and SNL vets Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig give very funny supporting turns as denizens of the amusement park.<br /><br />After watching this film, I had a feeling similar to the one that I got from watching the comedy \\"My Idiot Brother,\\" with Paul Rudd.  For though the laughs were there in plenty, I couldn't shake the feeling that in its own, quiet way, this film was just so very, very nice.  And I mean that as a real compliment.s here grow more from the comedy of human longing and emotion than they do from bodily function.<br /><br />The cast is first rate - in some cases, surprisingly so.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've owned several pair of these headphones over the last ten years.  I've given away even more of them.  As a mature person, I can say I've never been fond of earbuds.  My other choice was over the ear phones.  The smaller over the ear style leaked sound and the studio style which covered my entire ear was uncomfortable after a short while and blocked out most other sound.<br /><br />I loved these with my first set.  They fit well without blocking my ear canals.  I haven't had any problems with them staying in place (and I have an average head size for a woman).  They will bleed some sound if you have the volume up really high, but at normal levels I don't really notice any sound escaping.  With a normal volume level, I can still hear the telephone ring.  The cord is a bit on the short side as some reviewers have noted so don't expect to be able to put your music player in your pants pocket.  When I'm active, I use these with my Creative Labs Zen Stone (which unfortunately they don't make anymore), which is about the size of the tiny square apple ipod thingy.  (ZenCity is more anti-pod than ipod)  I just let the Zen Stone dangle from the end of the headphones as I go about my business, although sometimes I put the music player in a shirt pocket or attach it with a lanyard if I'm using a larger player.<br /><br />As to longevity, these have served me well.  My first pair did lose sound on one side after about a year.  I've lost two pair, although when mine went missing my husband seemed to come up with a new/newer pair all of a sudden....  My daughter sat on one and stepped on another, breaking both headbands in the process.  My current pair has been in daily use for about two years. Depending on Amazon's pricing I've paid as little as four dollars and as much as ten dollars for a pair.  That's a lot less than quality earbuds.  The sound doesn't equal a good quality studio style headset but rivals or exceeds most earbuds I've tried.  Plus, they stay in my ears without having to use a mallet to pound them in (earbud joke).
B004UA8D2S|2.0|****** SPOILERS ******<br /><br />This movie had temporary potential in the very beginning, but just went downhill. The dialogue was cliche and plot predictable. The characters made unrealistic decisions that lead to their deaths. Idiocy spread like the raging water that filled the caves. I was surprised all the females died because usually a female always makes it out alive with the surviving hero, or the female herself is the lone survivor. However, all the females in Sanctum were idiots and didn't deserve to survive. I felt more people should have survived. I think if they threw a supernatural element into the story it could have gone way further given the location and plot. On the pros side, the sets and locations were nice.<br />I'm happy I didn't pay to see this in theaters or heaven forbid buy it.

0553801473|5.0|Why is there so little love for this release? I found it all fantastic, in fact better then the previous book (book 4, A Feast for Crows).<br />In any book, there will some characters that are not as loved as others or get killed off and chapters that perhaps drag a bit but this series is a master work, every bit is a bit more background for the entire story. Yes, there were some \\"cliff\\" hangers from the previous book (as in a 1950's serial) but all in all it is keeping me on the edge of my couch reading and wanting to \\"know\\" what/why/when/how. As long as the next two books (or more) rap things up with no glaring loose ends, I will be happy and grateful to have the series to read.
B006WXW098|4.0|This CD belongs in the collection of every pianophile. It is wonderful. In fact, it is just short of being great. Decades ago pianists would record albums like this one, comprised of a variety of works with no particular theme except enjoyment. Recent times have seen an emphasis on completeness, i.e., the complete sonatas or the complete etudes, etc. of a given composer. Now we have a disc that is devoted to the pleasure of music and the fun of a powerful virtuoso.<br /> The program is extremely attractive, offering familiar works with tasty rarities. For the most part, Ms. Wang is quite successful in her performances, but she is outdone by a couple of the works as noted below.<br /> Perhaps the most enticing item on her program is the Victor Staub transcription of Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice. Ms. Wang has made some alterations to the score to fit her hands. Her performance is spectacular, easily outshining most orchestral performances. She plays this with marvelous virtuosity and musicianship. Now someone needs to record the Sandor transcription.<br /> Her performance of Chopin's Waltz, Op. 64, No.2 is one of the absolute finest I have ever heard, reminiscent of the glorious recording made by Rosenthal. The Rachmaninoff pieces are impressive, especially the Elegy, Op.3, No.1. The Scriabin works are also given fine performances.<br /> Ms. Wang provides a passionate reading of the Schubert/Liszt Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel, and she does a great job with Cziffra's flashy transcription of the Tritsch-Tratsch Polka. Speaking of trash, she also does a fine job with the trashy arrangements by Horowitz, who vulgarized the Bizet and Saint-Saens transcriptions done far better by Moszkowski and Liszt.<br /> Curiously, Ms. Wang is totally lost with the Gluck/Sgambati  Melodie. Her pushing and pulling of the rhythm destroys the flowing tranquility of the musical line. I assume that she has listened to the recordings of this piece by Rachmaninoff and by Earl Wild, since sheplays the same trills that they do, which are not written in the score. But she has nothing of their flowing beauty in her performance.<br /> Finally, there is Albeniz' \\"Triana.\\" This work is incredibly difficult. It is absolutely one of the most difficult works ever written for the piano, even more difficult than practically all of Godowsky's arrangements of the Chopin Etudes. In fact, when Godowsky wrote his transcription of \\"Triana,\\" he made many simplifications, resulting in his arrangement's being easier than the original. Almost no one can really play this piece, including Ms. Wang. She, like almost everyone else, stretches and twists the tempo in order to negotiate the notes. (BTW, Julius Katchen plays \\"Triana\\" marvelously. Get that CD.)<br /> Still, this is a wonderful CD. The sound is quite good; typical DG quality. If you truly love virtuoso piano music, you will be happy.

0062073478|5.0|The setup is delicious: ten strangers are lured to an island on the promise of various things, employment, fun, etc. only to find that the hosts are not there and that the large, empty house only contains the guests and a couple of servants. After dinner on the first night, a recorded voice on a record player proclaims each one of them a murderer who has escaped their crimes - but no more! And then people start dying, one by one...<br /><br />I've never read an Agatha Christie novel before, thinking that they would be corny or somehow like another popular writer whose work I disliked, Ellis Peters, but I was very, very wrong. This book was published in 1939 and is labelled \\"thriller\\" and yet 80+ years later I can attest to it remaining a thrilling read.<br /><br />The elements of the story: that the guests have no way of leaving the island; that they slowly realise that one of them is the deranged killer with a warped sense of justice; the nursery rhyme which tells them how they're going to die but not the order - it's all so masterfully plotted by Christie, I was barrelling through the book, devouring the chapters eager to see who would survive, who was the killer, and why.<br /><br />What's also surprising is the overarching sense of dread you have when reading. I read it at night, alone, with the rain pounding the windows and I found myself more terrified reading this than I'd been in years. This isn't just an amazing thriller, it's a truly scary horror novel too. As the number of guests dwindle, the claustrophobic atmosphere is palpable and the paranoia ramped up to such an extent that you can't help but keep reading at a ever-increasing pace until the final page.<br /><br />The only real critique I have is the way the final guest snuffs it, before the big reveal. It seemed a bit contrived. But I suppose it was possible for it to happen that way... a long shot, but possible.<br /><br />This is one of the finest mystery thrillers I've ever read which still manages to have an enormous pull on the reader decades after being published, an astonishing feat in itself. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read a Christie novel, this one was so good. I'll definitely read more and highly recommend this to all fans of great fiction.s to have an enormous pull on the reader decades after being published, an astonishing feat in itself.

1597801585|2.0|As others have indicated, this book had a great premise, but the characters are flat, the writing is poor, and the plot ends up being fairly dull. This is not worthy of a Hugo.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|need a lot of energy to really get in to it. there's a lot to do so you keep occupied.
0345803485|1.0|Pure trash...bad writing, bad verbiage...totally unbelievable conversations and characters. Embarassingly sophomoric. I am sorry I spent my money on this trilogy...walking them right to the trash. I should have bought one to preview, but didn't want to pay extra postage for three shipments. I was stupid all the way around. E L James, you are not a writer.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|As an avid Harry Potter fan, I decided I would watch this movie when I first heard he was doing it simply so I could support Daniel as an actor, life Post Potter. I figured it would be ok. It was fantastic. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Radcliffe as Kipps is amazing and you really get to see Dan stretch his legs as an actor. I'll definitely be getting this when it comes out on dvd.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|\\"Why Can't I Be Me and You be You\\" is Sinead O'Connor's best work to date.  Her voice is as gorgeous as ever.<br />Sinead's songwriting is as sharp as a knife and these songs are all winners...no fillers here.  I can honestly say I love every song. I hope Sinead will someday come to love herself as much as her fans love her work.  I highly<br />recommend this CD.
B0071BY084|3.0|I have all of Satriani's albums, studio and live, so I've heard a lot of this stuff on live albums before, as well as in concert. I'll concentrate on the new material on this live album, rather than the stuff that's been done before.  The Wormhole Wizards album had some real gems which, sadly, are not represented here.  He's elected instead to put his audience to sleep with some snoozers.  Said duds being Solitude, Wind In The Trees, God Is Crying, and especially Littleworth Lane.  I thought this last was a totally clunker on the studio album; it sounded more like a country song.  I'm shocked he found it bore repeating on tour.  The one awesome track that is missing here and begged to be performed live is Wormhole Wizards.  How do you not include the hard-rocking title track on the tour?  This is a brilliant, hard-driving track that begs for a live encore and I was shocked to see that it was not included here.  This song begs for some stage time.  Littleworth Lane totally sucks - it's slow, lame and doesn't go anywhere.  I am a big Satriani fan, have all his music and have seen him in concert several times.  I will buy this album, as I have all the others.  I'm just disappointed in this one glaring omission.  For all of Joe's musical genius, he sometimes makes stupid decisions; for example, the idiotic title for the Professor Satchacrapolis album, suing Coldplay, boycotting performing in Arizona to protest their perfectly legitimate immigration law, associating in any way, shape or form with Sammy Hagar....

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I finished reading Stephen King's new book 11/22/63: A Novel the other day and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Stephen King is hit or miss with me, I enjoyed The Stand and The Dark Tower Series but aside from them have not had much luck with Stephen King stories. 11/22/63: A Novel is a little different from most other Stephen King books because it deals with time travel.  The date 11/22/63 was the day President Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas. 11/22/63: A Novel explores what might happen is someone had the opportunity to go back in time and change that event and the repercussions of it.  Being a fan of Sci-Fi stories, Stephen King handled time travel in his own unique way and he handled it very well. I especially enjoyed how he knit  into some of the other stories he has written into 11/22/63: A Novel without letting the story get out of hand. The time travel aspect is handled very well  and the story focuses more on what the repercussions of time time travel are more than the actual act of time travel. I recommend 11/22/63: A Novel to anyone that likes Stephen King books or is a fan of a good story.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|Good strategy game. Starts out really easy and gets quite challenging by the end. My only complaint is that 100 levels aren't enough. Well worth the money.
0439023521|5.0|It may have taken me a little while (although not nearly as long as with Twilight) to finally start to read this well-hyped series - but I am really glad I did.<br /><br />It's a horrifying plot, yet very engaging. The characters are fantastic - very real. The story itself is just so well written. I think that's what surprised me the most. Not just that it was a fun, quick read, but it was actually really well put together.<br /><br />Overall, I cringe at some things even at my age, so I'm not sure how I feel about young kids reading/watching this, but for the rest of us it's a fun journey.  I sped through this book (and it's sequel) - so only one more to go and I keep staying up late to see what happens next. Bravo!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have already played for awhile and I am still having fun. cool concept. cool game with lots of ways to play each level.
B005LAIGPU|2.0|Okay, first I will say that one of the reasons that I did not care much for this movie is that I HATE this kind of film making.  That's the over-the-shoulder, 1st-person, portable-camera style of film (ex. Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project).  The main reason that I hate this is because I feel like I'm watching a reality TV show or documentary, not a movie.  When I sit down at a theater, I want to feel like I am watching a movie.  The other reason that I hate them is because the film makers normally try too hard to make it work, instead of focusing on the film itself.  I heard that Chronicle was filmed like that but I decided to give it a chance and walk into it with an open mind.  Unfortunately, the film confirmed my reasons all the more why I distaste this type of movie.<br /><br />First, I'll start with saying that the story was actually pretty good.  It was a character based action movie, kind of like Hanna.  Three teenagers stumble upon some kind of \\"radioactive alien crystal\\" which releases a weird energy that makes all of them powerful telekinetics.  The story did a good job developing the characters and showed them experimenting with their powers and taking larger steps throughout.  At first, they moved small objects and toward the end of the film, they were throwing heavy objects while levitating.  I also looked at this film as a superhero origin story.  I'll try not to spoil everything, but I felt that it concluded nicely with one character appearing ready to accept the life of a superhero.<br /><br />Now on to what I didn't like.  I said in the title that I felt that they tried \\"too hard\\" with the narrative camera.  Here's what I mean (this will probably only make sense if you've seen the movie, but I'll try to explain).  The film is entirely shot in 1st person, with the viewer apparently seeing everything through the lens of the character's camaras.  With that being said...how often do you see someone who just decides to \\"film everything\\"?  How many people to you know that film every waking moment of their lives including when they're walking or in the car?  How often does a girl answer the doorbell while still holding a camera?  And how can the viewer expect that someone who is in the middle of a confrontation with his cousin would care about or could focus on making his camera float?  The bottom line is that the things they did to try and make it more \\"realistic\\" actually made it more unrealistic. Not to mention, these kinds of films always have bad camera angles in a lot of scenes, so it's often hard to tell what is going on.<br /><br />Another thing I really didn't like was how short the film was.  By the time the credits started rolling, I had only been in the theater 80 min.  I'm glad I waited and only paid $1.50 to see the movie because I would have been pretty pissed if I had paid $10 for an 80 min movie.  This movie could have been great.  I normally like comic book type superhero movies and action movies.  This could have been a 4 or 5 star movie in my book if they had just made it a little longer and film it like an actual movie, instead of trying too hard to make the 1st person camera thing work.  Trying too hard to make the 1st person movie work in a good film is the same thing as trying too hard to find spots to enhance the 3D in a script with no substance otherwise.to you know that film every waking moment of their lives including when they're walking or in the car?

This is a stage in his life that may be a little more mellow, more mature, but it's STILL Jason!  We're all human...and that's what I like about him.  He's not gonna put on a facade and make just another \\"We Sing, We Dance\\".  He's at another stage in his life...and I appreciate that.  I especially like the fact that he shares his life with us, his dark moments...I've had them lately...and it's comforting to know that I can share those feelings and thoughts with someone who seems to have it all...but is honestly and truly still searching and growing!  I play \\"I Won't Give Up\\" every day on my way to work, 'cause it keeps me from that dark space that I don't want to attend but is soooo easy to give in to!  Thank you Jason!  I hope you know how much you change lives on a day by day basis!!  Peace bro!!  and get that laryngitis fixed!!  Looking forward to seeing you at the Hollywood Bowl!!!
0345803485|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me preface this by saying that I am not a literary snob. I enjoy reading books from a wide variety of genres but I cannot recommend this book to anyone. The writing is horrible, the characters shallow, unrealistic and completely unlikeable and the plot non-existent. The author uses the same words and phrases over and over and over again.  At one point I stopped reading so that I could go back through the chapter I was currently in and count the number of times Ana said \\"Oh!\\" or \\"Oh my!\\". The characters are constantly gasping, blushing, having sex or engaging in awkward conversations. Christian is a creepy, violent stalker who in real life would probably end up a convicted felon. The sex scenes were ok at first but quickly grew repetitive and boring. I just hope that the author writes a fourth book and kills both Ana and Christian in some horrible accident.<br />This book is so bad that it annoys me that I have actually read it. I wish there was some way that I could purge my brain of any knowledge of Ana Steele and Christian Grey.
B00011KHTM|1.0|The product I received was not \\"by Apple\\" as the description indicated.  It was a cheap knockoff that kind of looked like an Apple adapter, but did not function when plugged into my laptop.  I took it to the Apple store to test it, and they told me it just didn't do anything.  I will buy direct from the Apple web site from now on.
0316776963|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  It's easily my favorite Sedaris book.  Just read [[ASIN:B007F1TS64 The Cost of Living]] and it totally reminded me of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", so much so I had to re-read it again.

Also if they thought The Holy Bible was not worthy of their respect, I doubt they would have made a game about it.<br />Thank you
B007SYWFRM|4.0|there IS a way out of the game without turning off your kindle.. simply go to the &quot;stuff&quot; menu on the bottom right corner and press the &quot;options&quot; button. when the options show on the screen your kindles menu bar will show up at the bottom and you can press the tab and then the home button. my only issue is that it keeps telling me to update it to continue but it wont let me update.. other than that great app, very addictive.

An ode to the creative mind! A valentine to writing! Inspirational, emotional, heartwarming, and deliciously bizarre! A Classic!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it! I have beat it on random at least ten times! it has great graphics and is really fun. Recommended to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Mr. Landay has delivered an interesting readable book. I thought his depiction of middle school age teenagers was spot on. He must have one of his own to understand so well how they think and act. The author has the ability to pull you in, hold you, and deliver a final punch you never saw coming. I've read a lot of mysteries and page turners and this one holds its own.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Lightweight, nice looking, feels good, functional but only to a point... it won't stand like it's supposed to. It has a slight groove that the cover edge is supposed to lip-lock into, but the cutout design is so shallow it can't function as a stand at all. So while I do like how it protects my Kindle, that's all it's good for, and in my opinion, I paid too much to have it do only this one thing.
B004Y6CS8I|4.0|Sbtrkt made my favorite non rap album of the last year. The inclusion of vocalist Sampha on multiple tracks led to the high star rating. Digging the airy production. This is on in my kitchen daily while I knock out tedious prep. Makes me smile

I couldn't put that one down either. Finally, I just had to get my hands on \\"Mockingjay, so I purchased it through Amazon online. What A Great Ending To A Great Story! Loved it right to the end. NO small wonder it is so popular. Now, the first movie is a world wide blockbuster too. NO great surprise there either.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.  Ana's internal struggle of learning and accepting the lifestyle truly demonstrate the writers' ability to dive in head first into a very emotionally challenging position.  Giving life and a voice to Ana's inner Goddess and subconscious draws the reader into the turbulent mental and sometimes physical struggle of not only finding her own submission, but understanding the meaning of it.<br />Christians' story is full of wonder.  How do we see this Knight in shining armor, or is it shrouded in Darkness?<br />And where does Mrs. Robinson fit into all this?

B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is a musical genius, period. He is one of the few artists around today that sticks to the fundamentals of rock and roll. And he executes it so well. White is a great guitarist and vocalist that has put out music that is top notch in its craft.  Although the last three White Stripes albums were released less than ten years ago, they are already classics.  I'll admit I am not that familiar with The Raconteurs, but I like the few songs I've heard.<br /><br />White's first solo album, \\"Blunderbuss\\", is no exception to the greatness of his work with his bands.  It's well-crafted music that sticks to the fundamentals of rock-n-roll and highlights his amazing skills as a guitarist and vocalist.  Like the White Stripes albums, \\"Blunderbuss\\" is a palate of the grittier styles of music.  It incorporates blues-rock, garage-rock, and punk-rock, with a bit of country and folk.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks on \\"Blunderbuss\\". The three tracks I like best on the album are \\"Sixteen Saltines\\", \\"Freedom At 21\\", and \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\". \\"Love Interruption\\", \\"Blunderbuss\\", \\"Weep Themselves To Sleep\\", and \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" are also among my favorites. \\"Love Interruption\\" (the first single) is a soulful song. \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" and \\"Freedom At 21\\" are the hardest rockin' tracks.  \\"Blunderbuss\\" is folk-rock oriented.  \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\" and \\"Weep Themselves To Sleep\\" are among the album's bluesy tracks.  \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" is influenced by ragtime jazz. There are a few slower country-influenced songs towards the end of the album.<br /><br />I will admit though, I don't like Jack White as a solo artist quite as much as I like The White Stripes. There aren't any songs that are as good as \\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\", \\"Seven Nation Army\\", \\"My Doorbell\\", or \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\". Jack and Meg had a special chemistry.
B004L79VUI|3.0|I was disappointed with this latest Robbie Robertson album. Overall, it's a decent, listenable set of songs, but they don't have any real spark to them. If you were compiling a \\"Best Of\\" Robbie Robertson album, for example, you would be hard-pressed to find any songs from here that would deserve to be on such a collection. Robbie's guitar playing still shines on many of these songs, but his vocals remain a weak point, and most of the tracks just don't lift off and fly like I had hoped.
0802798225|5.0|I know, I know, it sounds totally clich&eacute;... But I have to be honest here: This book really took my breath away. I hadn't felt that way since opening the first page of Twilight (the first book in the Saga, let's be clear). I read an editorial review describing the \\"breathlessness of the first kiss,\\" and this is exactly what Perfect Chemistry inspired in me.<br />Yes, the end is somewhat rushed and breaks the nice flow of the book. Yes, Alex and Brittany are star-crossed lovers who are paired up (against their will) in a chemistry class. Yes, you can't help comparing some of the themes and overall context with works like Twilight or West Side Story, or even Romeo & Juliet (Baz Luhrmann's movie will be closer than Shakespeare's Verona tale).<br />But, hey, no story out there is completely new.<br />What matters (to me, at least) is the truth of the characters, and therefore the truth of the author who created them. You can't miss Simone Elkeles's sincerity in her written words, in particular those spoken by Alex. You can't miss how much of her heart she put in telling that story. And I guess, that's what makes a great book.<br />So HURRAH to Simone Elkeles for creating something so breathtaking (without the help of any vampire or werewolf). And HURRAH to the star of the show... Alex Fuentes!
B0034G4P80|4.0|Honestly the movie was to short for a marvel movie but overall if your going to see the avengers you might as well see all the superhero movies. But in the end this product was in excellent condition great shipping came earlier than shipping date and I am very satisfied with this product.
B007PRQNIE|5.0|I am having a hard time putting this book down.  The story is absorbing and has some very interesting twists and turns.  It has mystery and strong character development.  The author brings the reader from turn-of-the-century England to modern-day Australia and other time-periods in between.  I highly recommend this book.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I got this movie so that I could start collecting marvel movies and no need to say this was the best deal to the limit. It was in great condition great packsging no scratches.overall I enjoyed the money spent.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|This movie was a great disappointment. To begin with it was a poor effort at reducing the six part mini-series to a less than two hour movie. The actors were bland, their parts underacted, their effort very lacking. The chronology of the events was disjointed, the story line weakly developed and the significant events underpinning the plot were lacking.The character Connie was not depicted well, we thought, especially considering the significance of her observations. Nor was the description of Ricky Tarrs' experiences well explicated. These two characters contribution to the story is the foundation of the investigation of the mole.<br />No, one can not expect to reproduce in two hours what was successfully done in six, but it would have been better to leave this screenplay on the shelf.<br />If one had not seen the mini-series, one would be lost to the significance of the true story as LeCarre had written it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is more engaging than The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo.  Although you don't need to read the books in sequence, I found the second book to be more enjoyable because The Dragon Tatoo gives more detailed insight into the characters. The story line draws you in and is easy to follow, however, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with who the other characters are.  That said, it is an excellent, engaging read and I highly recommend it.
0439023521|5.0|I only bought the books after I watched the movie and I was so impressed by how good they have adapted the first book into a movie I hope the sequels follow suit as well. As for the books they are simply one of the most compelling and interesting series of books I have ever read. I myself am not an avid reader and I can't believe how much I got really in to these books. I started reading the first book on a Friday night then finished the next morning. I immediately went out to get the last two books and managed to finish the trilogy in one weekend. Never in my life did I read a book where I could not put it down the only times I stopped reading were meal times and bathroom breaks. I highly recommend everyone to read these books maybe people 10+. The books delves into some really deep values about loyalty, survival, effects of war, and a little bit of romance. I believe this is a book both boys and girls will enjoy. I thank and congratulate Suzanne Collins for creating such an amazing book series and for having turned me into an avid book reader.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|In the beginning it's a little confusing, but when you dive in the story, it's hard to take your eyes away from the book! Read it in less than 3 days! And it is much better than the movie too! Certainly recommend it!
B003CNQPNS|5.0|I loved watching this in the 80's and I am glad it has finally come to DVD. Long overdue! Street Hawk was a show in and of itself and less campy than Knight Rider. It is a classic example of the more imaginative shows of that era.<br /><br />As the packaging indicates the DVD includes the entire series, which was way too short in my opinion. There are a fair amount of extras on the second DVD which includes an interview about the making of Street Hawk with the two main stars: heart throb Rex Smith and Joe Regalbuto which is very good, there are also production pictures and diagrams of the bike, and cast bios.<br /><br />The packaging is nice as the bike and its rider are nicely represented, and the DVDs are  protected in a flip out case. I really didn't have issues with the sound or video like some reviewers did. There was no jumping or skipping and the clarity is just typical of 80's era TV. Could they have remixed the sound and done a better job yes but there are no glaring errors or huge issues.<br /><br />Joe and Rex talk in the interview about creating a \\"new\\" Street Hawk with updated technology. That is exciting but still nothing can replace the original series which was sadly only cancelled due to network time slot issues not popularity. (And the writers might have to deal with post 90's breakdown of social culture with more flawed characters which might not be so cool.)<br />Five stars for an 80's classic. If you are a fan of Street Hawk, or just love the classic shows from the 80's this is a definite purchase.

B001FB55I0|1.0|What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.

B005LZW8FO|3.0|What derails to some extent Another Earth is that the movie sets up questions on multiple layers but fails to deliver real answers. The premise has lots of promise and potential, but the film does not capitalize on many of these. Instead it pokes around emotional themes, chiefly guilt, remorse, loss, sadness, and wonder, stirs these up, but never quite lets them settle again.<br /><br />Brit Marling and William Mapother inhabit their roles fully, both delivering nuanced performances, but they are overshadowed by the twin Earth and its moon looming larger and larger as the movie progresses is the movie's core. The movie never explains what this twin earth is doing there, what will happen when it, as it seem, inevitably smashes into the first earth, or why this second earth has no effect on our earth's gravity, tides, climate, communications, and, most baffling, day-to-day behaviors.<br /><br />The few supporting characters seem utterly unmoved by this looming planetary doppelg&auml;nger. Is it even real? Is there some allegorical message here or is the director winking at us? When we finally get some theories from the one scientist given screen time, his take is all babble. Yes, the final scene hints at various outcomes and probabilities, but it is not enough to redeem this movie from its own overbearing smugness.

B000065V3H|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Patrick Dempsey!  I love the 80's, and I love the movies that cascaded throughout the genre of the 80's that fell upon some unforgettable romance flicks.<br /><br />If you have high hopes about this, settle down.  This movie is a sweet, feel-good movie meant to be watched on rainy days to remind us of the carefree and simple innocence of love.<br /><br />I applaud the actors, and the storyline.  It has a unique (for the time it was made) take on young love.<br /><br />This movie is something I would love to watch with my teenage niece, or catch up on a girls movie night with my friends.  Anyone can appreciate the music, cars, high school struggle that almost anyone can identify with one way or another.<br /><br />This flick leaves a lot unsaid, so for the dreamy watchers out there, this will definately be something worth watching!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say that I wasn't interested in reading this type of book at first. Once I started reading the book I could not put it down and ended up reading all the books in TWO DAYS! Although a few scenes in the books made me blush, I have to say the story between Christian and Ana is fabulous. I enjoyed learning more about the characters and seeing how everything unfolds. I thought the books were great and I plan on reading them again soon!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is not an inspirational novel for the dying, nor is it a depressing novel for the living. Hazel, a teenage girl living (or dying, as the case may be) with terminal cancer, walks through the grey area between vivacity and death, a sort of twilight that only those who are dying can experience. Even though suffering is constantly in the background, the characters rebel against what their bodies have dictated their lives to be like through use of their brilliant minds. And that brilliance the characters possess is the soul of the novel, the reason why it rises to such heights. Hazel and Augustus do not accept their fates blindly and wallow in sorrow; rather, they question everything and fight to make their existence mean something. Their approach to life is immensely interesting. John Green is a genius.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars is to me what An Imperial Affliction is to Hazel. A book with such value that \\"it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"

0439023513|3.0|**Contains Spoilers**<br />I have very mixed feelings about this book, particularly the ending.  Seeing as how the plot was steeped in darkness and violence from the beginning of the first book, I can swallow the idea that the last book wasn't supposed to have a \\"happily ever after\\". The ending left me feeling numb, confused, sad, but slightly hopeful. I think this is exactly what the reader is meant to feel because that is exactly how Katniss feels (and realistically, it's how she should be feeling considering all she's been through).<br />That being said, there were definitely some ways the book could've been better. I became confused during some of the action scenes. It just felt like they weren't very clearly written. Because of this jumbled confusion,the deaths of Finnick and Prim were not given the attention they deserved. Although, this could be the author's attempt at making us feel the numbness and confusion of war. What really upset me, though was the part where Coin proposes a final Hunger Games. Katniss votes in favor of it but then kills Coin? Why??? Did she really want that game to happen? I can't imagine that. Then why not just vote against it? Did she reconsider her position and kill Coin on impulse or was it a plan from the beginning? Did the last Hunger Games still take place seeing as how the votes were in it's favor, or did the idea die with Coin? The answer to these questions are pivotal to whether I would end up hating the person Katniss has become, or loving her in spite of her flaws and trauma. Sadly, I can't come up with any real answers. Consequently, I can't decide whether I love or hate Katniss...or whether I love or hate this book.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Great game at the beginning but once you buy all the land and fill it up, the game gets super boring because everything left to buy requires acorns and those, you can't earn in the game like you can with coins. Once you're past the first couple days of the game, you're no longer playing an building/earnings game, you're now playing a time gambling game and as with all gambling, the odds are completely stacked against you. Even though the game guides tell you that you can earn acorns by catching Scrat run across the screen, that's completely false. The only way to get acorns is to wait for ice piles to build up and hope that an acorn is hidden under it. Unfortunately, you will almost always get the coins. Unlike earning coins from the characters, the ice piles appear based on actual game time, not real time. With the characters, you can leave the came and come back in a day or two and you'll have coins waiting. With ice piles, you actually have to have the game open to get them to appear. Even the game within the game is a gambling game. No matter how well you score in the mini-game, the final screen will always determine your \\"reward\\" with a surprise gift animation that is based on odds and independent on how you score. The mini-game score is just for fun. Again, you will almost always get the smallest number of coins winnable. I've never won more than a few acorns with the mini-game. I think this is meant to push the game out to several years if you consider that it takes several hours to get one acorn through this game of time/chance and to buy just the 4,000 acorns required to \\"collect\\" the Therapod family, that's going to take you a year or two of playing 24/7, nonstop to acquire. The alternative is to spend the $180 to earn the single family, let alone the hundreds of hours and/or dollars to earn the 29 other characters that can only be earned through acorns, let alone decorations and \\"fun\\" stuff. Thus, it's a great game while you have continuous goals and things to buy but once you start getting to the acorn portion of the game, the game is super lame. You no longer get any goals and earning coins doesn't allow you to do anything with it. You just spend your time collecting tens of millions of coins while you wait to earn an acorn. If you have nothing else to do but frantically tap your tablet for no reason to make it make coin and star animations/sounds, then this game is for you but if you're goal oriented and looking to complete the game, look somewhere else unless you get entertained by shiny animations and clinkly noises. The alternative is to just play the first part of the game and stop playing unless you just have hundreds of dollars you're looking to throw at Gameloft. I've completed up to level 40 and there doesn't seem to be any ending that resolves the game as being completed. It just goes on endlessly until you get bored.gs to buy but once you start getting to the acorn portion of the game, the game is super lame.

0143120530|2.0|I actually don't want to remember everything. It's not worth the effort. Instead, I am going with a theory that I read in New Scientist a while ago, namely that 'downtime' every day is essential for your memory processing. I am clearly not having enough downtime. I certainly don't want to spend lots of time making up long-winded stories to remember things. An iPhone will do instead. There aren't any particular surprises in the book, which has rather minute text and forgettable anecdotes. I recommend delegating information to a minion or offspring to remember, writing notes and lolling about as much as possible.

It was an incredible story of two people who meet and feel an attraction towards each other that  can not be explained, physically and emotionally. They want more and find a way to get there but find themselves trying to overcome obstacles to get there. Overall, it was a wonderful book I enjoyed and recommend.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is one great little book! I'm not one for adventure/sci-fi-type books usually, but this one was a page turner. I admit I jumped on the band wagon because all the hype, after finishing this book, I'm looking forward to the other two. It's easy light reading that you can probably finish in one sitting; I'm a super slow reader, so it took me two evenings to finish it. Sometimes I found myself gripped with suspense, other times I was laughing because the main character's sarcasm can be quite amusing. Anyway, highly recommended!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Hmm... Well, let's see if I can sum up my Hunger Games experience. The writing was not polished, crafted or literary, and sometimes a little sloppy, but her premise was addictive. I was glad I had purchased the complete trilogy, because it would have been frustrating to have had to wait for the next installment. The world was dark, dangerous and hopeless, and the characters were flawed, yet accessible, true to their context, and heroic in the limited manner their perspective would allow. The dystopia of the novel was a brutal warning of the potential of a world crafted by humanistic ambitions, values, and self interest, and a much more realistic mirror of our global society, as it airs on our own reality television, nightly, than we would like to admit. Our Father, who art in heaven ... Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done. Save us from ourselves and our sins against You, and our sins against our brothers and sisters.
B005EGXTHG|3.0|I am  enjoying the hunger games even though it is very different and a little disturbing. The way our real world is going maybe we could end up that way too.  We all should take note .  I am looking forward to catching fire.

A thorough understanding of the material will save you from making many, many bad decisions in life - personal, practical, and financial. It's worth every dollar and hour you spend on it.

B005H29GSI|4.0|Not too sure about the TNT box and bird launcher. If you drop the TNT box from about 25\\" it will explode.  The bird launcher does not really work out either.  If you can buy another Angry Birds set and use its launcher it will work (FYI, if  you put the Big Red Bird in the launcher too hard he can't fly out.  I did it once, it was so funny :)  Written by an eight-year-old boy and avid Angry Birds fan.<br /><br />My son was frustrated and disappointed by the operation (or lack thereof) of the TNT box.  Did not function as designed.  He still has fun with it and plays with it, but, in my opinion, this is overpriced for questionable quality.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am in my 50's and had never heard of The Hunger Games until the movie was released.  I downloaded the trilogy and I must admit it is the first time in a long time I have read all 3 books of a trilogy within a 1 week period.  I just had a hard time putting it down once I started.  It was an excellent read as far as I was concerned.
B001QXZ81G|5.0|My wife and I saw this film when it first came out in movie theaters.  What an absolute gem.  Whoever thought up the idea of a romantic triangle between a boy, a girl and a computer, was a genius.  Edgar (the computer) becomes jealous of Lenny who, in a shy manner, is trying to woo Madeline (played by beautiful Virginia Madsen).<br />  The magnificent soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder (Flashdance) makes the film worth it.  I immediately rushed out and bought the sound tape.  In one gorgeously inspiring scene, Edgar and Madeline play a duet of \\"Lover's Concerto.\\"  The song was popularized by the Vogues but this instrumental version is aurally stunning.<br />  Edgar's problem is that Madeline thinks the unseen other half of the duo is Lenny. The concept that a computer, which traces its lineage to a TRS 80, can have human emotions might seem laughable, but the movie pulls it off brilliantly.  In fact, when Edgar comes to the realization that he can't have the girl, viewers get misty eyed at his sad departure. However, the ending is very upbeat.<br />  For some odd reason this movie didn't do well at the box office but it is almost a cult classic as far as I am concerned.  Hopefully, one of these days it will be released on DVD.  Till then, you can watch several key scenes by going on Youtube.  The famous duet is titled \\"The Duel.\\"

B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is a awesome game, but its not a tower defender at all. You control a hero that summons troops to fight for you and you have multiple special abilities that help you defeat the 50 waves. Just so you all know the bow is the best weapon, and on higher waves use lethargy and tornado / troop trample. Upgrading your leadership level to 4 as fast as you can is a good idea too seeing as how it spawns points faster. Overall 5/5 but it wont work for me now... can't press game start on title screen.  Fix and you'll get your star back :)  (kindle fire)
B0000009S3|5.0|First, I'd like to comment on (or more appropriately, complain) about the availability, or total lack there of, of this album in any format.  It's absolutely appalling, that inferior artists are having one special edition after another of their junk released while classic masterpieces like Hot Rats remain completely out of reach.  Yeah, you could spend 69 dollars on a used copy, but frankly, it shouldn't have to be that way.  And it's not just Frank Zappa who has gotten the cold shoulder from record companies.  Key albums from Kate Bush, Gang Of Four, Happy Mondays, and Moby Grape also remain out of print.  Meanwhile, Katy Perry's Teenage Daydream (a junk album anyway you look at it) is given premium treatment...go figure.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I must say, this is Frank Zappa at his finest.  Here, Zappa has abandoned his usual comedy and satire approach to his music and has created an array of sounds mostly rooted in jazz and fusion.  Gone are the jokes and avant-garde experiments of his Mothers Of Invention days.  Now we get, what is in my opinion, what late 60s/early 70s Zappa is all about: instrumental experimentation. Though there are similar sounds running throughout the album, no two tracks sound alike.  Peaches En Regailia is a fresh blast of mostly keyboard acrobatics, courtesy of Zappa keyboard wizard Ian Underwood, while Willie The Pimp contains one of Frank Zappa's best guitar solos.  The album is almost entirely instrumental with Captain Beefheart providing the only vocals on Willie The Pimp.  The Gumbo Variations is a 16 minute (4 minutes longer than the original vinyl version) jam of honking saxophones and wailing guitars that serves as the album's centerpiece.<br /><br />Jazz fusion has always been a very underrated and misunderstood genre.  Jazz purists have singled in out for its radical departure from \\"true\\" jazz forms.  Meanwhile, the general public is simply not predisposed to enjoy this type of music.  Personally, I believe fusionrepresents what music should be all about; taking risks and experimenting with unique sounds.  Frank Zappa was possibly rock's greatest risk taker, and this album is definitive proof of that.<br /><br />If you are used to albums like \\"Freak Out\\" (itself a good album) it might take a little while to warm up to Hot Rats.  It is not a straight forward pop album by any means and it is a challenging listen.  But then again, nearly all great albums are challenging listens.  As I said before, this has unfortunately become a very hard album to track down, but it is well worth it.
0345803485|1.0|I hate myself for falling for the hype and reading this drivel.

This is extremely frustrating and time consuming. Fix this bug and I'll happily up my rating to 5 stars. BTW hurry up and release part 2!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read all three books. I must say,they were the best books I've read in a while. Romance,love,trust,great and exciting sex. And I must say I've tried a lot of the things in the books. After the first book,my husband bought the rest for me.We've reconnected in so many different ways. I love these books. I've read them twice already and will start them again next week.

0061743526|5.0|I just completed reading the 50th anniversary edition of this classic book, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", by Harper Lee. A mockingbird entertains the listeners by its pleasant songs often mimicking other birds. The title of this book roughly implies that it is always a crime to harm a person who has always been helpful to you. This subtle lesson for everyone's life has been effectively conveyed by Harper Lee through the eyes of a third grade girl child called 'Scout' Jean Louise Finch. The main protagonist of this novel being her father Atticus Finch. Though the novel is bit dated, it is a pleasurable read even today. Let us see why.<br /><br />The plot of the novel is based on the incidents in a county called Maycomb in the US. Widower Atticus Finch, an advocate by profession, lives with his two children - 'Scout' Jean Louise Finch and 'Jem' Jeremy Finch. They are accompanied in their house by a cook called Calpurnia, who is a Negro. Jem is elder to Scout and they have their neighbor Dill who accompanies them during vacations. Atticus defends a Negro called Tom, a married man, accused of raping a white woman. The girl's father Bob Ewell is a notorious trouble maker. The novel unfolds how the hierarchy in American society influences the lives of Atticus and his family.<br /><br />I really liked the character of Atticus as a father. Jem and Scout learn a lot of good habits from them and Atticus never loses his cool even when his children do some mischief like poking neighbor Boo Radley. The entire story's soul is Scout who is the narrator of all the incidents leading to the fracture of Jem's hand. Their affection towards Dill, a deprived child, moves you. The first person narration of Scout brings out the innocence evident in a kid of her age. Other characters like Tom Robinson, aunt Alexandra, and cook Calpurnia are all very realistic. Even the characters such as the neighbors of Scout, Bob Ewell, and Heck Tate keep the story more interesting.<br /><br />The only complaint about this novel may be that it stagnates at times on even minute details. But all the loose ends are tied and well knit towards the end making this novel a sort of thriller. It is an irony that Harper Lee never wrote another novel after writing this one. She might have surely felt that the expectations would be sky high from the readers after producing a timeless classic like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". She might not have wanted to risk trying to exceed the perfect story telling evident throughout this novel. I liked this novel and strongly recommend to readers who enjoy English classics.<br /><br />This novel is really a must read as it educates one as how parents have to live by example to make better humans out of their children. It also exposes the disparity prevalent in societies across the world. There was incidentally an English film of the same name based on this novel. Gregory Peck won the best actor Academy award for portraying the role of Atticus Finch. There were two more Academy awards for this film that year. However, I feel the entire credit for the film must be attributed to Harper Lee. She was instrumental in delivering a masterpiece which may be classified as one of the best English novels ever written. This novel is an important addition to any one's bookshelf.nt about this novel may be that it stagnates at times on even minute details.

B001EOQTME|3.0|The cover is a bit blurry and details are not as visible as on the original edition.Sound-bass is better-BUT details are killed by it and voice is drowning .makes sense to wait for a better one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun! i wish they gave a higher energy level what the give doesnt last long! but it is worth playing:)

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was an easy/fast read. Follows the same path as most Sparks books but **spoiler** has a fairly happy ending. Enjoyable even if a bit predictable.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Every time I use the dopler radar/ satelite the application crashes. It is unusable and they are not fixing it. Amazon needs to put weatherbug on its selection of applications.
B0079XNWQA|2.0|I am not a music expert by any means.  I do not stick to one genre either.  Most of my music selections are based upon the few artists I like and follow; while the remaining selections are based upon what the \\"experts\\" are saying.  The majority of the time I am please with their recommendations.  In the case of this choice I am very disappointed.  The music is well produced, but I could not relate to the songs.  Maybe those in their 20's will enjoy the selections more?  I kept two of the tracks; \\"Living in the Moment\\" and \\"93 Million Miles\\", and discarded the rest.  My 18 year old daughter declined to download any of the tracks after listening to them.  I don't think that I will be purchasing any more Jason Mraz music.  I would imagine that if he is a favorite of yours, then this new offering will appeal to you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is seriously addicting to my family I'm not even kidding I like playing and listening to Pandora at the same time which makes it even better so buy this game:)))
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|continued to play all the way through to a high level when the game no longer registered any of my buildings or animals. waste of time.

B006QVRUS2|2.0|Imagine the most intense 5 minutes of a Woody Allen or Ingmar Bergman movie sustained 90 minutes.  I understand the original play dictated the dialogue. But even the two calmer characters were forced into nonstop staccato ping-pong delivery.  This material begs for pregnant pauses to breathe and apparently the actors and editor were not allowed to provide them.
B003BFTS9K|2.0|The pin that keeps the snap lever in place failed while on an overseas trip without a spare.  Fortunately it came apart while I was securing the connector so I didn't lose the tiny piece.  I needed to creatively hammer the pin and jam it back in place before securing it with the barrel lock.  Though it is locked, I don't have the flexibility of removing the strap from the camera as often as before without unscrewing the fastener from the camera.  This will be a great connector when the pin issue is fixed.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|I want to start off by saying Sherlock Holmes is a great character.  The author goes to great lengths to offer you some insight into the mind of one of fiction's greatest thinkers.  As told from the perspective of Watson, Sherlock's grounded and amazed assistant, the stories flow with an epic smoothness<br /><br />  I like the fact that this is a collection of short mysteries.  It is great to read at work when I am \\"on call\\" for 15-20 minutes as I can read an entire story which invariably leaves me hungry for the next one.  In short, I would recommend this book to a friend.
B000YMJA7I|4.0|Do you want to rock?  If so, this is a great album from one of the essential rock bands of the 80's.  Never too polished, and always full of energy, this makes a nice addition to any rock collection.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed being able to read all 3 of the books at one time.  Once I started reading them, they were hard to put down.  No character was safe. I was able to lose myself in the books.  I wanted to read the books before watching the movie.  I would recommend them.

This resonates very well with me.<br /><br />Anita says \\"Fear\\" caused her Cancer. Hence her advice to \\"Surrender to God/Universe & live your life fearlessly\\". Going to the spiritual realm, she says: \\"I AM love was the most important lesson I learned allowing me to release all fear & that's the key that saved my life\\". Her practical advice is fantastic, which is to look at our every day decisions & see if they are based on Fear or Passion. She says: Quote If everything I do each day is driven by passion & zeal for living, then I am \\"Being\\" but if my actions are a result of fear, then I am in \\"Doing\\" mode.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|If you are looking for a short, quick guide to how to publish on the Kindle, this tiny booklet will readily fill the bill. And, if your book is less than a megabyte in size, and is essentially straight text, and you do not care too much about the formatting details, this should be the only book you need. I am guessing that the previous description would apply to 70-85% of those publishing on Kindle.<br /><br />But, what if you find yourself in a different group? What if your book is larger than a megabyte? What if your book is not just straight text, but uses graphics and tables intensively? What if you want to give your book a little spice by having certain footnotes point directly to text, and others pointing to a webpage?<br /><br />Well, I guess if you are in this last group, this is not going to be the book for you! That is why my review is 4 stars, not 5. So, if you find yourself in the first group, no need to read any more, but if you find yourself in the second group, read on.<br /><br />Yes, if, like me, you publish nonfiction books that are loaded with tables and pictures and graphs and footnotes, a book that could easily exceed a megabyte in size, you're going to have to pursue a different route. To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, take a look at my most recent book, [[ASIN:0962098167 Impossible: The Case Against Lee Harvey Oswald (Volume Three)]]. Go ahead and download the sample, and better yet, download this volume, which will be free on the 22nd of every month. I've tried to make that book as professionally formatted as a Kindle book can be, with extensive control over all the parameters, including the amount of points a paragraph is indented, what quotes should look like, optimized graphs and images, and so forth.<br /><br />If you want to pursue the route I have taken, you're going to be starting with Microsoft Word, as this book suggests, but you are only going to use Word as a starting point. Once your basic book has been written in Word, you're then going to have to copy and paste your HTML into a program like Dreamweaver. Once you get into Dreamweaver, you're going to have to modify the HTML \\"class\\" tags, and ultimately move the entire thing kit and kaboodle into a program called Mobipocket Creator. Fun, fun, fun!! If you want to optimize your images, which is what you are going to want to do to reduce your file size (remember, as an author you have to pay .15 per megabyte, so if your book is 10 megabytes, and you want the 70% royalty, you're going to have to pay $1.50 every time someone downloads your book! How is that for motivation to optimize your images?). To optimize your images, you will be using a program like Photoshop.<br /><br />And, of course, if you want to do some fancy tricks like turning footnotes into hyperlinks that take your reader to source material that you have quoted, you're obviously going to be in the HTML world.<br /><br />I hope I haven't scared you as to what the realities of the situation are, and if you fall in the first class, you don't have to worry about any of this. But if you're doing a complex, large book, with heavy formatting, you need to understand why the method described in this book is probably not going to work for you, and you should understand that there are other ways to do the book, which will give you the results you desire.d, you're then going to have to copy and paste your HTML into a program like Dreamweaver.

B004SOR4H6|4.0|I couldn't givs it 5 stars, because i never figured out exactly how to reply.  Therfore making it a little confusing.  In addition, I liked it because I could talk to Sara Bareilles.  Since she is my favorite singer, and my role model, it was like a dream come true.  If it werent for this app there would be no way I could talk to her!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I confess to purchasing this book because of all the hype. I honestly didn't expect I would enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />I read all three books in the trilogy in six days because I couldn't put them down. And on the last page of the last book, I was sad to say good bye.<br /><br />They may not be the very best written books, but they were pretty darn good. Yes, they were naughty and a little dirty, but if people will let themselves go and not be too uptight, they might find they enjoy that aspect. I did. But the sex wasn't even the best part of these books for me. It was the characters. I fell in love with all of them, especially Christian and Ana. I turned the pages quickly, anxious to find out what was in store for them next. Several times while reading I cried for them and my heart swelled and leapt for them. I wish the author had written their story as a series instead of a trilogy - I could've read a dozen more.

0765316994|4.0|I will not go into a description because the other reviewers did a fine job. \\"Redshirts\\" is the kind of book which starts off in a familiar way and then takes a startling turn. Then another. Scalzi is a good writer and it needs a good one to carry this off. You get carried along by the plot, from time to time thinking \\"Whoa!\\" or \\"Wow\\".<br /><br />I have given it only four stars because, for me, it fizzles a little bit towards the end. And the codas, IMO, are a little self-indulgent. A writer throwing stuff in just because he can.
B00466HN72|3.0|I watched the movie with my teenager niece.  The movie had it moments but was not as funny as the trailers.  Enjoyable but not very funny.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game is fun but very challenging. I would recommend this for anyone who likes a good puzzle game. overall its a great game with easy controls.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This will be short and sweet. This cover arrived on Tuesday and i put my fire in it an it was an easy installation. Nice material and easy use. The card slits are for those who carry their fire with them on a day to day basis and there is only about five slits. There is no room for money or anything extra, so if you were thinking about using this as a wallet replacement, it wont work. My first take on it was it seemed a little cheap, but after using it a couple days its really not that bad. I like the material on the inside best, it has a cloth like feel that lets me know my fire wont be scratched. The outside is just okay. Seems like some kind of plastic leather material. Its hard to describe, but overall not a bad case. It does stand and you can do a 180 degree turn for either reading or typing.

It was an excellently written and descriptive book  Cannot wait for the next Movie....

B003ES61EE|5.0|I bought this ages ago through Amazon when I get my first dSLR. I bought it when I bought the camera not really knowing exactly what it was I just added a bunch of crap to my cart willy-nilly. Silly right? Well not at all! I was so grateful I purchased this on a whim because I accidentally put a finger print on my lens. I couldn't get it off and was freaking out so I went through all the products I bought for my camera and come to find out this piece took it right off! I was so relieved you have no idea.<br /><br />When I went on vacation I noticed I happened to have misplaced one of the pieces and it is of course gone forever since when you lose something and need it you will never ever find it again until you move and it is laying on a table where the goblins who stole it in the first place have seen fit to finally return it. So hence my second purchase. I will continue to buy it until I turn blue in the face it is the best $8 investment ever.

B005L38QHA|4.0|Its only been 1 day, but wow what an awesome mouse.  Finally a button on the right side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very slick design, the artwork is also beautiful.  It glows whatever color you want.<br />Polished surface.<br />Fits my hands like a glove.<br />Very accurate.<br />Software is easy to use.<br />Lots and lots of buttons.<br /><br />With all the pros above, there are a few cons which led me to give it only 4 stars.<br /><br />cons:<br />The right button takes a lot of pressure to click, and its in a wierd spot where only people with a 1-inch-long ring finger can get to.  People with longer ring fingers are going to struggle with it.<br /><br />Although there are many buttons, the 3 top middle buttons on the mouse are in a wierd spot as well.  And its unrealistic to be able to press them in the heat of a battle.<br /><br />The software was made for WOW, which I don't play.  It'll take a lot of guesswork to re-configure the buttons to what you want outside of WOW.<br /><br />overall:<br /><br />still the best mouse I've ever owned.  If I had it my way however, I would make a few design changes.<br /><br />Edit:  Today, about a year and a half from this purchase, I am happy to say that I am still pleased with this mouse.  The craftsmanship of this mouse is just superb!  All the buttons are working like new, and even the surface shows NO wear!  All other mouses paint would've been reduced to ar white smudge by now where the two clickers are, but this mouse still has a shiny coat of gloss as if I just got it brand new (which I didn't)!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an AWESOME book!!!  Could not put it down.  It entertained from beginning to end!! I would recommend this book.

I would LOVE to use some for a wallpaper.  Maybe in a future upgrade??  you do have to have the app open when you transfer but I am thrilled to get my photos on my Fire.  Awesome app
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Gilmore Girls is fantastic!  Each season is better than the previous one.  Enjoyed both Seasons 3 and 4.  They provide lots of laughs.
B0055S348W|2.0|Bought and paid for this app thinking it was just what I needed for my Kindle Fire. Then I go to print up my first document on my WiFi printer, choose yes to download addition thing for 4 mb. and get an internal document render error 64, or some such thing... I was able to print photos, and preview an excel file - didn't get the error 64 with that. But, unfortunately, it seems you can't use Google Docs or Google Cloud printers with this if you have a Kindle Fire. Works for some things on a WiFi printer, but very dissapointed overall - at least until they have all features useable for Kindle Fire users too. Other than that, nice looking interface.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great service from Amazon Video. We were wonderfully surprised of the availability of the series. The quality of the HD was great too.
0307716546|5.0|I read Rosamund Lupton's debut novel 'Sister' last year. You may remember me raving about it - it was a fantastic read. I jumped at the chance to read her second novel - Afterwards.  Another absolutely brilliant read - one I would highly, highly recommend!<br /><br />I was hooked from the opening paragraph of the prologue.<br /><br />\\"I couldn't move, not even a little finger or a flicker of an eye. I couldn't open my mouth to scream....Only one thing for it, I said to myself, thinking of you, and I slipped out of the wrecked ship of my body into the black ocean.\\"<br /><br />Grace Covey is volunteering at the outdoor sports day at her son Adam's private school. Her older child Jenny is working inside as the school nurse that day. When a fire breaks out, Grace races to find her children. Knowing Jenny is still trapped in the building, Grace runs into the burning building. She finds her, but the two of them are terribly injured.  Cue prologue. Yes, Grace and Jenny are able to leave their ruined bodies. Now, anyone thinking this might be a mainly paranormal type of read is wrong.<br /><br />Honestly, Afterwards is so many different reads. In the beginning I saw it strictly as a mystery. Grace and Jenny are able to follow along with the investigation into the fire - for it was arson. And Grace and Jenny cannot communicate with the 'outside' world.  Piece by piece, along with the victims, we are able to cobble together what really happened that day. There is much more to this fire than meets the eye. Lupton employs many twists and turns and some red herrings along the way that kept me guessing at the identity of the 'culprit' until the last few chapters.<br /><br />But, in addition to the mystery is the deeper story - that of a mother, daughter, son, husband and father. Grace's love for her children is achingly beautiful, powerful and so poignant.

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I read numerous great reviews of this and OneNote.  I tried using both, but both require creating an account before you can use it.  I don't want to create accounts, I just want to take notes.  The features that you can use with an account, like syncing, may be great for those who want those features.  But if I don't want to use those features, the programmers should not prevent any access to the program at all without an account.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|Pretty good app, but to sync and edit on PC, you pay an extra 15-20$.  Just and FYI for you folks who want to edit on PC and sync over to Droid.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I got the print version of the book earlier this year, then went and got the kindle edition too. \\"It's Not All About 'Me'\\" came highly recommended by some friends and mentors. I now highly recommend the book too.<br /><br />Robin Dreeke teaches the skills based on his own experiences using them. He doesn't just talk about the 10 techniques he used, and the results, he gives the reader just enough information to start putting the techniques to use. He doesn't give all the information, because he wants the student to go out and figure out what works for them, instead of just mimicking him.<br /><br />I was already doing some of the 10 techniques. I just never realized that they went together. I've been told I've always been easy to talk to, but after reading the It's Not All About Me, and putting the other skills to work, I've seen things change for a positive in my life. I've become less introverted, and have had some very interesting conversations with people.<br /><br />Using what I learned from Robin Dreeke, has also improved my work environment. I don't find it as toxic any more, even though some co-workers think it's gotten worse. I think the most impressive thing though, is even the more standoffish members of my department have become more relaxed in our interactions.<br /><br />Read this book. It won't take long, but perfecting your take on the ten techniques, will take you a lifetime. It'll be worth it, and if your results are like mine, you'll find yourself smiling more.
0446698342|5.0|This is my favorite Nicholas Sparks book! I am so glad that they made a movie of this one! What woman wouldn't fall in love with a man who walked all the way across the country just to find her?
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|There seems to have some paragraphs missing at end of chapter 21 (the monkey), book 2.  How did \\"Morphling from District 6\\" show up suddenly?  No description at all.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am so sad to reach the end of this series.  What will I do without Christian Gray in my life?  I just couldn't get enough of these books! Spoiler alert*** You gotta love a happy ending ;)
B0018QQQK8|4.0|When Logan returns from three tours in Iraq he feels compelled to find the woman in a picture he found over there that was a sort of good luck charm.He winds up finding Beth but will he tell her about the picture? Another good Nicholas Sparks book. It was a nice love story with some drama and suspense but it luckily wasn't one of his tear jerkers. He knows how to write a good story and I enjoy all of them but its nice to read one once in awhile that doesn't leave me crying at some point. This is one of the we ones that after reading it I would be wiling to subject myself to the Movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just can't seem to get enough of Christian and Anna.  These books are great.  Don't let all the hype scare you away.  These books are GREAT!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Lots of fun to play. It never gets boring. You can play for hours and hours and not grow tired of it.
0374203032|3.0|This is a good book with interesting and somtimes shocking examples of humanity's ability to put a price tag on everything, and I agree completely with the arguments and conclusions being made, but that is mostly because I have heard or read them all before. There is nothing new here that hasn't already been said in terms of the inexorable commodification of everything and the resulting effects it has on cultures, communities, and individuals everywhere.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Book is awesome.  Kindle reading is awesome.  However, the file isis corrupt. The page number is stuck on page 41.  Pretty frustrating when reading with friends to tell where you are.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm an old fart and way out of the demographic for this novel but I finished it and liked it...not enough to get addicted to the romantic angle of the story but I love the trashing of tyrannical government and the stupid media.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|We the kindle fire users are limited to a shorter version. Meanwhile the Apple users can easily downland all levels, and get updates of even more levels for free. We get about 50% of the game, and have to pay for it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome game. Would like to have more of the Upgrades w/o having to become a vip member.  But still all and all a really good game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cute game!  All the cute characters are here.  easy to figure out.  easy to lose track of time when you are trying to complete tasks.<br /><br />/
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am ecstatic that I'm able to have this - finally - on my Kindle. I have it in an older version of the iPod touch but the graphics aren't great. I freaked when I saw this finally available. So excited.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Initially my wife picked up and read this book.  When she told me what it was about, I thought it sounded lame.  Then she finished reading it and was onto the 2nd book faster than I have ever witnessed her reading any book.  So I decided that I better give it a shot.  I am so happy I did - I couldn't put it down and I still can't shake the story of \\"The Girl on Fire\\" from my mind.  I LOVE IT!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|AAAAAAAAAAAA SEVAAA&Ntilde;&Ntilde;AAAAAAAAAA HERABIIICHIIIKABAAAAAAAAAAAABUE SERABANBA ECHIKABABAAAABUE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE!!!!!!! LION KING 3D. bout time draw something is here. hooray and screw the minimum wordz
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Perhaps I am a pessimist, but I always check the one star reviews first before purchasing any product. The ones for this title ARE NOT EVEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE FILM!!!!!! Every prospective buyer beware! Such a classic film, and this is the definitive version! :)
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Well made movie. It is a true life story and is very well directed. Acting is very good. For those who love baseball and statistics will like it. Will recommend this movie.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|This movie consists of 3 separate story lines which only come together at the end in a clumsy and unsatisfying manner. I'll give it better than one star because the Sumatra tsunami scene is impressive (as special effects) and the story is an emotionally moving tear-jerker at times.<br /><br />This movie promises insights into the afterlife, yet delivers little. From what we see we can expect something like a celestial department of motor vehicles, crowds of people standing around waiting endlessly to be called. And this is supposed to give me hope?!<br /><br />Probably the high point of the movie came when the French woman broke up with her annoying boyfriend, who is best described as too shallow, too cynical, too Jean Paul Sartre, too much body hair, in short too French.<br /><br />I suppose Hereafter aimed to be a \\"feel good movie\\". But in the final analysis it's a \\"feel I wasted my time movie\\". I wonder how many people actually walked out on this slow crawling yawner when it played in theaters? Probably half of those who didn't fall asleep.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Excellent game, but seriously full of major bugs that ruin it. DO NOT PUT REAL MONEY INTO THIS GAME! Still fun as a demo if you accept it as such. Maybe they'll fix it someday, but be aware that these complaints have been ongoing since late 2011.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app out there.  I wish it came in NKJ.  I would read the KJ and listen to the NKJ.  Still, love this app :)
B007WPM4V4|4.0|This episode jumped around with three major stories going on. It would have been much better to make it a two parter. It was nice to see Peggy stand up for herself and to have a fun filled afternoon. Was sick of her getting picked on.<br /><br />Also nice to see her and that cutie pie Ginsberg have some kind of poignant moment together after having such bad mornings. Wonder if they end up together or stay friends? Have tried to like Peggy's current squeeze , but Abe is such a downer and Peggy needs someone to compliment her. Roger drops acid with Jane and it makes them nice.<br /><br />It was hilarious , when the vodka bottle started singing opera and Roger and Jane wore pink matching turbans and laid on the carpet, chatting like little girls at a sleepover. Was not understanding what happened with Don and Megan at Howard Johnson's ????????<br /><br />Was Don sick and having another weird nightmare, or was this part of Roger's trip or did it really happen ? Was hoping Don and Megan would stay happy , but it is looking like one of them is gonna kill the other? I guess we will have to keep tuning in. Wonder if Bert was talking about Peggy running everything or Megan ? Hope Peggy is not getting fired that would kind of ruin the show.
0345803485|5.0|This book was awesome! I've never read a BDSM story so this one was a bit of a shock. It was a great book, it made me laugh and cry. I highly suggest reading this book and the rest of them!
B007VPLNGW|5.0|I love this game. its simple, but challenging. the graphics are adorable. cant believe it was free!  definitely worth the download,  especially on a kindle fire.
0545265355|5.0|There is something about reading good books in hard cover form! The advent of The Hunger Games movie gave me the best excuse to read not only the first book, but the trilogy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|addicting.cute.but need to fix freezes.i can not pass the task where you have to go to the other world it just resets.but love it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm not sure how I heard about this book, perhaps it was a combination of book bloggers and Amazon recommendations, but I was curious to know why people were so enthusiastic about this book.  I downloaded a sample and was slightly still on the fence on the book, but decided to go ahead and download the whole thing given the positive reviews.<br /><br />I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID!  I finished this book in one sitting, and immediately downloaded Book #2 when I finished Book #1 in the early hours of this morning.  This book had wonderful characters (primary and secondary).  I often find myself disliking secondary characters b/c they are so annoying, but not in this one.  This was a romance, but it was also so much more.  I found myself enjoying the tension, relishing it even, that the author generates from a situation that keeps the two primary characters apart.  It was realistic and didn't go into the annoying world of the \\"series of misunderstandings.\\"  At the same time, this book was about the things that life can throw at you and the importance of family, blood related or not.<br /><br />When I finished my last really good book, I immediately searched for the next really good book.  It takes a while and I usually end up re-reading the last ones in the interim, wondering if I will find the next one and starting to doubt with all the OK books out there.  Well, this fits into that amazing, to be re-read category.  I'm so glad that I took a chance and picked up this book, and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|its kinda hard and very confusing I can bearaly get past level 3 but it gives you something to concentrate on .....<br />but get this app its really fun you just half to get it to find out.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Excellent app. Simple and fun. I'm glad there is finally an Amazon version for the Kindle! The Android appstore version is great as well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|having fun with it. the option of buying game gear bugs me but its not too crazy with it like some games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept my attention throughout.  I couldn't put it down because I had to know what was going to happen next.  It was brilliantly written and easy to read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is an amazing app and has awesome games.The games are fun but challenging.I would recommend this app if you like fun but challenging games.:)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting since the day i got my kindle fire for this app, and it is finally here! BOOYAH!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Ive always been waiting for them to put draw something on Kindle Fire! Now they finally did! =) =) =)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game.  easy to play, reminds me of Mario bros.  I would recommend this game to anyone who asks for a fun free game to play.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun. Very additive.  you collect fast  doesn't take long to start new stuff  love it very fun
B00785P2QC|5.0|its really fun to play and addicting I really love it I would reccomend it to anyone its simple and easy to play
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it! I'm still learning all about it but it has been very easy to figure out quickly. It takes me back to my childhood.
1439177783|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I read the entire thing in less than 24 hrs.  I could not put it down. Her story will keep you rivited.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love the movie with Gweneth Paltrow and Jeremy North and so i read the book.  It was wonderful.  a great classic, a great look back in time. The characters are rich and the prose keeps you reading.  Best of all, it was FREE.
0439023548|3.0|I was suprised about this one. I could barely put the first two books down and felt that until about 3/4 of the way in, this book didn't have the same feel. Except that the characters were the same, this almost seemed like it cold have been part of another series or a spin-off to the HG books. I I really wasn't as big of a fan this time out.
B007WZ7ILK|4.0|\\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is probably the best new Beach Boys single since \\"Goin' On\\" (1980). It's probably their SWEETEST new single since \\"Add Some Music To Your Day\\" (or maybe \\"Good Timin'\\").<br />Really love the unison singing, which makes the harmony passages stand out even more stunningly, and just LOVE the a capella break right after the key change (that singing with the plucked bass notes underneath is CLASSIC Brian Wilson).<br />The melody line of the refrain is reminiscent of a million different songs I remember from the radio (I'm hearing a little of the theme from \\"Midnight Cowboy\\") and yet it's totally new at the same time.<br />What I also love about this single is the sound of the harmonies. This particular Beach Boys blend, I don't think, has ever sung together on record (Bruce Johnston and Dave Marks weren't ever in the group together). Brian's tenor lead is strong, while Jeff Foskett's high voice shores up his falsetto nicely. You can hear all of the guys in the blend without any one of their voices taking over.<br />Most notable to me is that you can really hear the ABSENCE of Carl Wilson, and no one really sounds like they're trying to cover for him. That absence gives the record an appropriate light note of sadness and loss.<br />A lovely record, certainly their best single in YEARS, a nice synthesis of Brian's style with 2012 production values, of a song that sounds both familiar and new at the same time.
043902353X|5.0|Loved it! Need I say more. I felt I enjoyed this as much as the first and the twists and turns were very engaging.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app makes me wish I had a tablet or ms surface. only spent about an hour total with this app, but it is fun to play with. I recommend using head phones or plugging in to a soundboard. the low end sounds are great and the gravity mode is good for randomizing. I would dl this app again and plan to when I get a tablet.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|would be a great game if energy didn't deplete so quickly you could wait 3 minutes to do 1 thing and then wait 3 min more to do 1 more which is frustrating! This game seems to require lots cash for tools etc.... . In one word greedy. Also constantly harassing to tell you who your friends are visit 1 then 5. I've played free games (angry bird &amp; where's your water) they just have advertising not this. Lots of fun in the beginning just to try to hook you.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I came across this artist by chance.  I sampled this CD and purchased it awhile later.  I am soooo enjoying this.  I am now going to sample his other albums and take it from there.  Should you choose to purchase this you will not be disappointed!
B007SGM084|1.0|I bet the book is good.  But the Amazon price?  Thirty bucks for a trilogy that's not written on paper?  Yep, I'm on my way to Costo to buy the paper version.  If I'm going to pay thirty bucks, I'd rather have it on paper.  Can we say gouging?  Not that I didn't already pay a fortune for my Kindle in the first place.  Good think I'm still a paper book collector.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome and challenging at the same time. yea.... also my favorite one is the wishing one. I loveee sushi
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so glad I found this app... I can now take my kindle to church and be able to follow along with the preacher using this app...
B003ZMF26W|5.0|This is a great looking mouse. The red matches my sidewinder x4 keyboard perfectly.  Tracking is excellent, though the dual laser system does cause a minute amount if cursor jump if you pick up the mouse too far. (I use the excellent gigabyte m8000x ghost mouse pad ) The dpi changes are quick and easy to configure with packaged software, but some things are a little difficult to figure out unless you google. Overall an awesome package that doesn't break the bank.
B005ZUR724|5.0|its great it has good graphics and is awesome buy it no matter what and don't lisin to the bad reviews
B004047XXO|5.0|This movie was not only great family entertainment and funny the anaglyph (3D) was was well made. I didn't see any ghosting effect in it and the DVD come with the glasses which comes in handy if you have none.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am not and expert at sharpening so this tool was perfect for me. I used it to sharpen me kukuri machete. I used a dremel to try to put a better edge on it but made it worst. The carbide edger on this tool was perfect for fixing my mistake. Then the actual sharpener put a perfect edge on it. I also used it on my pocket knife that I carry and use everyday. It made it super sharp. I'm going to use this on every blade I have around my house.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love how fun this game<br />is. only issue is trying to get out. gotta go to stuff n then options to get out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the books for my Kindle before leaving on a vacation out East and read all three books while traveling - just couldn't put them down!  So interesting what can happen when government takes over and people lose their freedoms!
B007MDB71O|5.0|There are some things that you wait for all your life, and then are disappointed when you finally get them. \\"John Carter\\" is most certainly NOT one of those things. I fell in love with John Carter, Tars Tarkas, and the Incomparable Dejah Thoris as a boy of 14. Half a century later, I am still in love with them, and I will always be grateful to Mr Stanton and all of the men and women who brought our mutual dream to the big screen in such a faithful manner. Was it perfect? Of course not. Did it leave out some of my favorite parts of the story? Certainly. But I'm don't really feel that those elements are lost, since they have been included in everything from the old \\"Flash Gordon\\" comic strips, to \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Highlander,\\" \\"Avatar,\\" and too many others to even mention here. Of course, only the real fans are aware of that fact, since Walt Disney Studios, for some inexplicable reason, chose to keep it a deep, dark secret.<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" has been the brunt of a lot of half assed comedians jokes and would be movie critic's reviews (which are themselves little more than jokes)but the actual truth is that this movie was murdered by the very people who should have been working the hardest to see that their investment proved successful. If Disney Studios had implemented an advertizement campaign only half as great as what was given \\"The Avengers,\\" \\"John Carter\\" would have been seen and appreciated as the great movie that it truly is. It's not too late, even now. Disney COULD mount a proper advertizing campaign and re-release it in the fall or around Christmas, with considerable merchandise tie ins. With the recent management turn over there's a chance that maybe it will really happen. In the words of John Carter himself, \\"We still live.\\"
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the temp icon in the status bar. I travel a lot, and particularly like the way this app constantly updates to my current location. The amount of weather information available is good. The only complaint I have is that the temp is often several degrees off. Even when manually updating, it still seems to lag behind.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this app is great. I'm able to store my resume in my SD card and open it with office suite and also make changes, if I needed too.
B0074Y2YZ4|4.0|Travelling is a little different from other Roxette albums even from the album Tourism that it is trying to emulate. What I loved about Tourism is the stripped down acoustic nature of it with songs like Never is A long Time, Silver Blue and The Heat Shaped Sea and Here Comes The Weekend. It gave Tourism at times a country vibe and at others a folky vibe. Travelling on the other hand is a bit more synth laden and this doesnt appeal to me quite as much. Also lyrically I think perhaps Tourism is better. There's only so many songs from Roxette I can handle with a lyric about holes in someones shoes. Ok lets start at the beginning then.<br />Me and you and Terry and Julie is an interesting mixture of a song, its a little bit psychadelic and mixes tempos quite a bit then there's a long instrumental sequence. Like most people have said its a bit of a strange one in Roxette terms to open the album with. Usually they start with a bang, something rocky and fast paced. This isnt quite that. So a funny choice. Lover Lover Lover is probably the catchiest new song on the album. \\"Could you tell me what love/life is about\\" really sticks in your head. Typical Roxette. Perhaps has a more mature feel to it than some of Roxette's older hits and I think this is good. Turn of the Tide is a nice sweet ballad, reminds me a bit of No One Makes It On Her Own. Its got that feeling about it. Its sweet, and the lyrics are nice. Just a peaceful nice song. It lacks perhaps some of the raunch and sex appeal and raw passion and edginess sadness of earlier songs so could be criticised as being a little cheesey but I dont think it is. Its just a song about nice things, a happy song which I think is commendable and its nice that Roxette have some of these songs on their album. Everything doesnt have to be bittersweet all the time. So here we are getting happy ballads. Touched by the Hand of God I'm not overly fond of. Its ok, but I think the lyrics are a bit silly. Something about Prudence coming outto play out of Charm School. Is there a song by the Beatles called Dear Prudence or something...anyway even if its a tribute it isnt that well put together lyrically. Easy Way Out is a nice enough ballad and here we get a bit of that folky country and ambling feel that was perhaps so beautiful about The Son of the A Plumber projects, and I think that this album does have a vibe that is sort of a mixture of the Party Crasher album and The Son of A PLumber albums and perhaps Charm School as well. Its a bit of everything rolled into one. And I'm not sure if that's the greatest thing as it doesnt have an overall consistent vibe like most of Roxettes other albums. It doesnt meander it kind of goes everywhere. Its Possible catchy yeah but a little bit cheesey and once again I think perhaps one of the worst songs on the album has been picked as a single. On Charm School I loved songs like Dream on and After All And Noone Makes it on her own but instead Roxette are almost trying to appeal to a modern audience again. I dont think it really works. They need to get over trying to write commercial songs and just be happy where they are. This is what made Son of A Plumber such a fantastic album. I liked Way Out off Charm School though as a single but Speak to Me? that was a strange one to chose I thought. Moving on Perfect Excuse is a  different version of a song off Son of A Plumber. I really like the Son of A Plumber version with Helena's etheric vocals in the background. I kind of think Helena doesnt fit so much on Roxette tracks, no disrespect to her as she is an amazing singer and SOAP is all the better because of her. Her voice is just very etheric and doesnt quite go with the Roxette feel when you already have Maries Amazonian as Per puts it voice. I do however think that this is quite a nice version of the song with Marie singing it instead of Per's falsetto. It perhaps doesnt improve the SOAP version but it offers an alternative to it that is equally good so I dont haveissues with it. It is also lyrically one of the best songs on the album. Excuse Me Sir Do You Want Me To Check on Your Wife is quite an epic song and another slightly wierd one like You and Me and Terry and Julie. Again SOAP influences here but I dont know if it quite works as well as SOAP because of the synth ladenness of the album. It doesnt have that meandering feel off SOAP. Still its an interesting number and will no doubt grow on me. Angel Passing is a nice strip down ballad again with a SOAP feel to it and this time they get it right. It slows the album down nicely and brings it closer somehow. Stars is a good enough remix of the song though I think I still like the original better. It suited that album. But I dont have any issues with it here. The Weight of the World is nice enough and She's Got Nothing On but the Radio I guess as something recent. It is a catchy song I'll give you that and a rocker and has a bit of punch to it. I think perhaps its grown on me a bit as it sounds good live and in this album it seems better placed than it did in Charm School perhaps just because I really like some of the other efforts in Charm School and it seemed somewhat out of place. But here with Stars it kind of belongs almost as a Have A Nice Dayish end to the album. See Me is a beautiful song and one of the standouts on the album. Its raw and honest and beautiful and Marie sings it beautifully. This is what is so powerful about Marie's voice. It has the power to affect you emotionally. This song has brought tears to my eyes at times. Its Possible v2, well you know my feelings about this song so to have two versions of it I really think that one is enough. I actually think that this version is more suited perhaps to the album and they could just not release it as a single. The other version is more of a single version though I guess but it hasn't done well. I dont know the lyrics just arent that great. Its a little cheesey for me. \\"When I get that feeling its so revealing\\" \\"I just want to oh oh oh\\" at times it just feels like Per is trying to make words rhyme for the sake of it. It Must Have Been Love you'd think this song has had its day and another version would have been a waste of space but actually this is also one of the standout tracks of the album. Its just a beautiful full version of the song with the symphony orchestra in the background. Its really nice to have this version completing the album. It just makes the album that little more worth listening to. So there you go my faves are See Me, Lover Lover and It Must Have Been Love. Perfect Excuse, Angel Passing, Easy Way Out and Turn of the Tide and Weight of the World are all nice ballady tracks. Me and you and Terry and Julie, Excuse Me Sir do you want me to check on your wife and Touched by the Hand of God are curious new tracks that are good but dont stand out as being amazing. And then there's the live tracks which are all valid and strong. And then its possible for a cheesey catchyish single. Its ok. Overall its a slightly different offering from Roxette that sees them going in different directions but I'm not entirely sure which one. haha but perhaps that's the beauty of it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I am enjoying the book and I am looking forward to the others in the series. I read using my Kindle.  I recomment the Kindle and Amazon books.
B001383XT8|4.0|This is a good clone but not exact but close to the hm-2 made in Taiwan. Recommended for the price and usability.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was purposefully not reading this series because of the closely related ties that it seemingly had to other previous works. But, after sitting in my To-Read list for a few years now, I finally succumbed to the pressure of my peers to pick it up. And, I can say that I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Though the book isn't particularly well written, it does have its moments of brilliance. I'm not a huge fan of the \\"first person, in the present\\" style that Suzanne Collins has adopted here, but for the most part it works. The only glaring problem I had, was the main character, Katniss, is supposedly street hardened and wise in the ways of making deals to keep her and her family alive, and for the most part she is. But, when it comes to other things like common sense and love, she is overly naive and rather dimwitted on both accounts.<br /><br />There is also and obvious political message buried just under the surface here, that I won't get into, but I still rather enjoyed following Katniss through her trials of The Hunger Games! And will be continuing the story with the following books.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I really enjoyed the game up until level 18 or so until it became evident that you had to pay real money to upgrade or get certain fighters. Guess that is why it is &quot;free&quot;
B007JWKLP6|5.0|Actually, he was somewhat repressed as a \\"Beatle\\" and was an incredibly talented musician. This was clearly evident as his first single \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was the first by an ex-Beatle to reach #1 on the charts. Not too shabby!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great on Kindle Fire!  The puzzles are progressively more challenging while the music and visuals are<br /> relaxing.  Definitely worth the .99!
B007FH9GT2|4.0|Very good version of the book.  Beautifully shot and please let David Fincher and this entire cast make the next 2 movies!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a good game and also a good time waster. it has everything from hunting and fishing to planting crops
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack is my hero. Every single thing he touches becomes brilliant. As if white stripes, dead weather, and raconteurs weren't enough, now he does a solo album and it's equally (if not more) mind-blowing. Then he takes it a step further and launches it via 1,000 helium balloons of special vinyl editions! Like i mentioned before, EVERY SINGLE THING HE TOUCHES IS BRILLIANT!!

B0077PBPY6|1.0|The person who wrote the description of this movie, that is on the case and also is what enticed me purchase this, must have read the book.  Because none of the plot described in print is contained in the movie.  The move has long sequences of silent stares into the camera, some gore, and some (oh I am glad the kids are not in the room sequences).  Sadly the movie is so bad I am not even enticed to see if the book actually contains plot. This is my first wrong movie purchase of the year.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing!!!!!  you have to use points to get games but the game is addictive. I play it every day!!!!
B005LAIGPU|4.0|a buddy of mine got an early dvd of this movie today and told me i should check it out. I watched it with an open mind and it was definitely good enough for me to pre-order it on blu-ray a few minutes ago. i love the show Heroes and this is what it reminded me of. and it also reminded me of the anime Akira in some aspects (an outcast who abuses his powers and when the boy yells and bust windows out buildings around him). just normal everyday people who were given powers. i wouldnt recommend this to people who dont like movies were people are holding the camera the whole time. ex: cloverfield. but if you do like Heroes, i would recommend purchasing this movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a very well written and wonderfully acted series of British high living back in early years before WW1 and years after.  With another movie being produced now (Series 3), I cannot wait for the release date because the first two were good, clean and loving series.  It shows how the British Earl and his family, along with all the help in Downton Abbey, lived and went about their daily chores.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is an awesome game. u should to. I love this game .well that's all I have to say. awesome.
B004JK61K0|3.0|Pros: User interface is very nice and customizable. Its fast and hasn't crashed on me.<br /><br />Cons: No send button when writing a email (its a menu option). Does not sync well with Yahoo Mail. Gmail is fine, but Yahoo must be done manually and messages can get stuck in the outbox.<br /><br />I really want K9 to work, so I am sticking with it for now. Its better than stock for the Fire.
0439023521|4.0|It's a story about post-apocalypse era where children between the age of 12-18 are chosen to fight in a competition entitled The Hunger Games where they have to kill each other in order to survive. Main characters are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. The story line is (sort of) exactly the same as in the movie but personally, I prefer reading the book as it has more details about what Katniss thinks, other scenes and a few other characters that you would not be able to find in the film. I believe that it is beautifully written and portrayed but I made sure that I had a dictionary next to me while I was reading throughout the book. Maybe it's just me because English isn't my first language but even my friends who were born in an English-speaking community did not understand a few words like seam, acridid, urn and apotheracy. But overall, language wise, not words, it is one good book. =)

B000GCFY0I|3.0|We read this book in school. I , like always, read ahead. I finished the book on the second night. The first thing someone in my class said was ,\\"I don't wanna read this!!! It's a girl book!!!!!\\" Never, ever , ever judge anything by its cover!!!!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent read! I couldn't put it down. It was very convenient to have all 3 books together on my e-reader so that I could continue to the next book immediately, like it was just the next chapter.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so much fun It makes you wanna eat lucky charms. I'm only on the 3rd level but its so much fun :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so far don't have any issues with the game fun and easy to play. the wait for energy isn't to bad which is a hood thing.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|Game froze several times. Very choppy, not sure why it is like that. Using a Kindle Fire. Other than that, good game.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|great ideas and functionality but continuously finding miss spelled words.  really like using this app daily but if i was reading the Bible for the first time it would not help with all the miss spelled words.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I haven't read a Nora Roberts book in a long, long time. I was delighted with The Search. I found it compelling. My interest never wavered. The characters (human and canine) were believable. The story-line was believable - and scary. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Nothing gets blown up, nobody is murdered (that i saw anyway), there's no martial arts expert, no stupid vampires or make believe fairys, no witches or covens, no time travel involved either, no one running for their life from a gang of crime bosses, no rediculous human robots seeking to destory the world, and it doesn't move at a very fast rate.  All the things that seem to have so many people mesmerized these days.  I can see why some don't like it.  To each his own.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  The all star cast had most of my favorites.  It's just ordinary people going about their ordinary lives, and dealing with ordinary relationship problems (with maybe the exception of Hugh Grant's character.  I mean, after all he WAS the prime minister and all that).  If not for the all star cast (with a few exceptions, not everyone in the movie is a mega star or very well known), it may have not captured my attention, good move on the casting department kudo's!  Well acted, good scenes, good music.  I'll watch it over and over.
0547569653|5.0|It took Scott Jurek a lot of guts and work to run his first 100 miler... and another and another. Here's the way it came down, and how it (hopefully) will work for other semi-potatoes like me. Conditioning and discipline get explained in a story that really was an inspired read. I came away with a better sense of self, nd what can be done.  Recommended, runner!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Most books take a chapter or two before you see anything happening. Like planting seeds and waiting awhile for the plants to grow. But not this book, if you like action that will wear you down then grab this book.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Started watching Breaking Bad via Netflix because I had heard some good things about it and because I was intrigued by the concept.  Just finished watching Season 4 via Amazon Instant Video and I am blown away by how exciting each episode, character and plot is.  This has to be some of the BEST writing and acting on a television show in a long time.  I highly recommend this show and getting caught up before Season 5 begins.
B00466HN6S|3.0|As mentioned in other reviews, this is a combo animated/live-action film about Easter.  EB, the \\"heir\\" to the Easter Bunny throne, runs away from home to follow his dreams of playing drums professionally.  He ultimately ends up with Fred O'Hare (played by James Marsden), who is a dreamer who doesn't fit into any job and is being forced to find work by his family.  Mayhem ensues, with EB defecating jelly beans and basically making life havoc for Fred.  After misadventures at a video game company and a run-in with a famous talent-searcher, Fred and EB end up saving Easter from the diabolical chick assistant Carlos (and finding their own dreams and friendship after all).<br /><br />First of all, the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The scenes of the Easter Factory are beautiful -- some of the most wonderfully animated settings I have seen.  The studio does a great job of fitting EB and other characters into the real world, down to shots normally missed such as shadows and reflections.<br /><br />The voice and live acting are pretty good, with Russell Brand performing as EB. James Marsden interacts well with the animated characters as well.<br /><br />On the downside, for most of the film it is almost impossible to find interest or care for the characters.  EB is a spoiled child who does everything he wants to wreck other lives, and Fred is a dreamer who tries to deal with the wreckage.  It's kind of unfortunate that you can't find empathy for either child, both of whom are trying to please their fathers but failing.  Finally by the last 15 minutes of the movie you find that EB and Fred can compromise, work together, and reach their dreams while reconciling with their families.  But if you can't make it through the first 3/4's (most of which involves making humorous messes and some potty humor) of the movie to that point, you probably won't really care about the ending.
0385333846|2.0|being dyslexic does not provide me with the time and  patience to read a book like this. If I'm going to put so much time and effort into reading a book it should be worth it. this book was not worth it. i think there was only 2 sentences in the book i enjoyed reading. the rest of the book was just randomly weird(not cool weird), unentertaining, and the characters weren't so relatable. the general story was really boring and dry. I think the only reason why people read this book is because the famous author. i gave this 2 stars just because those 2 sentences at the beginning of the book i liked were really good. other then that...it sucked.<br /><br />Reading this book was like eating stale tasteless bread. But If you like that, then hey, go for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a book that I absolutely could not put down. E.L. James is a wonderful writer and I like the way the author continues the scene into the next chapter to keep you reading.A taboo romance novel like no other. Loved it!!!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A wonderful addition to my Kindle. It is so convenient, when I have some down time, to have SH with me in my car.
0385737955|5.0|If you're into dystopian series than the Maze Runner is for you.  This book is very easy to read and is jam packed with action.  Dashner is able to paint a very descriptive picture of the Maze and different characters without getting bogged down in too much detail. I love how he leaves a lot of to the readers imagination.  This book has memorable characters, especially Thomas, Newt, Minho, and Teresa that you will fall in love with.  I wont get into any description of the book so I don't spoil anything, but if you enjoyed the Hunger Games the Maze Runner is a great book to transition too; I honestly like it more.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three  books were very good. I may never have read them if it were not for all of the attention they got, buy I sure am glad that I got to read them before I saw the movie. Easy read. Interesting and keeps your attention. Once you get into it you will not want to put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesomest game ever this is the best game I have ever played the games are fun and they have all kinds of variety
B0006HBERA|5.0|We have two huge shelves filled with board games for my son and he's not even 5 yet, so when I say this is a particularly good game, I have a lot to compare it to.<br /><br />The board and pieces are attractive and engaging (especially for preschoolers who love vehicles - you actually get to drive little double-decker buses around the oval track and you can fill a larger cardboard bus with adorable passenger cards).<br /><br />The addition and subtraction component is basic and accessible even for kids who wouldn't understand if you asked them what's 2 plus 3.  If they land on a + sign on the track, and the white die says 3, they understand that 3 people get to go on their bus.  It's up to the parents to decide whether to go deeper with the math (\\"You had 2 people on your bus, and you just put on 3 more.  How many passengers do you have together?  That's right! 2 + 3 = 5\\" etc).  Each big bus holds a total of 10 passengers, so that makes for a lot of good math conversations, since 10 is such an important number.  It's easy to help them learn all the ways to make 10 by focusing on how many more passengers they need to fill their bus.<br /><br />This game does not require any reading, but the way the game proceeds is a bit complicated for a child who doesn't have any experience with board games (red die tells how many spaces the bus moves and white die tells how many passengers change), so I wouldn't recommend this as a first game, but if a child has enjoyed playing one around-the-board type game, this would be a great one to follow up with.<br /><br />Three things that I particularly like about this game . . .<br />1. It encourages imagination and pretend play.  Pretend play doesn't come naturally or easily to my son, but the graphics motivate him to incorporate it in the game.  For example, he'll look on the oval track and see that there is a ferris wheel, and pretend that the woman who is getting off his bus is going to the fair.<br /><br />2. It helps children deal with a manageable amount of disappointment.  When we land on minus spaces and passengers have to get off, we can use our imagination about where they're going to distract ourselves from being frustrated.  Also, things change pretty quickly, so someone who seems to be the clear winner in the beginning of the game may have an empty bus after two turns.<br /><br />3. The game has a nice, clear stopping point and doesn't go on forever.  So many preschool games involve waiting for someone to collect all the pieces or catch up after being sent back to the beginning or something else that just takes TOOOOOOO long.  This game always ends fairly quickly when all the players have gone around the track.with a manageable amount of disappointment.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved the game and was hooked on it. Then it started glitching like apparently everyone else's and when it does it resets everything to ridiculous amounts of time. It needs something but I don't know that an update would help. Thinking I might just go ahead an uninstall it since I've developed a love/bate relationship with it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Anastasia Steele! Oh my God, was she awful! \\"I want you...I can't please you...I'll never leave you...I can't give you what you need...and on and on and ON!\\" Grow up! At one point in the book, she stated that she doesn't understand why Christian likes her. You and me both, sister! And then there's the sophomoric writing! It's soooo repetitive...repetitive...repetitive! But wait! Just when you think the same phrase is going to be used, YET AGAIN, the author throws in some arbitrary word that causes you to have to use your Kindle dictionary and doesn't fit in with any of the other elementary wording that takes place throughout the book. Who uses the word \\"avuncular\\" in everyday talk? Am I really supposed to believe that a word that advanced is coming from the same person who constantly refers to her female anatomy as \\"down there\\"? I'm rolling my eyes (which is quite ironic because that was a central theme in this book)! I haven't even finished the book but after the marriage proposal, I could take no more! I had to stop what I was doing just to write this review! And I probably won't finish the book because it will most likely be another 100 pages of \\"His eyes are gray...He looks impassive...I bit my lip...Gasp...Oh my...He finds his release...blah blah blah!\\"
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is awesome.  This is a great addition for any Adele fan.  I really enjoyed the video.  Adele is a true down to earth, funny, and talented person.  I applaud her.
0345803485|2.0|Like many others, I fed into the media hype of this book. I heard such good things, so I figured why not? I started reading and after getting thru the first few pages, I found the beginning to be highly over detailed, boring and predictable. I continued going and by the time I reached Chapter 9, I was highly disappointed. In a matter of opinion, I do not believe mothers should share this with their young daughters, that opinion though, is yours to decide upon. The book is not what the media is making it out to be. People are unaware of what the story really entiles.<br />If you're looking for a narration of a pornographic s&m movie, than this book is for you. If you're expecting, hot passion filled sex scenes, try looking towards a Jackie Collins novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if you don't get this game you would be. missing out on fun I love this game. there is coins if you get a check you coins unlock new or buy with coins you want regret it
B001E8V6GE|5.0|If you are like me, and you love your \\"man cave\\" or hold your entertainment system in high regard, then this is a must for your collection. Then again, I don't need to tell you that, because you probably already have SILENT HILL in your blu ray collection.<br /><br />Well, this is the blu ray's blu ray. It is the best quality out today.<br /><br />To me, perfect sound, picture, and story is hard to find. It comes along once in a while with movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars series, Heat, etc.<br /><br />The thing is, I always wanted a horror movie that was held to those high standards, too ...<br /><br />Well, here it is. The 1080 DP full hi def version of SILENT HILL<br /><br />Perfect sound, picture, and plot.<br /><br />This movie was MADE for home theaters, not 19\\" TV's. This is not the movie you watch on your (well, my) parents TV. This is for the home theater enthusiast.<br /><br />It will do justice to the home theater you have worked so hard for and chosen carefully.

0131103628|5.0|I've been using this book on and off for an entire semester now.  This book is a great reference to get exposed to all the basic constructs and functionality of the C language.  Sometimes the author's code examples are a bit esoteric, but can be deciphered with some effort.  Overall I would recommend this book as supplementary reading to anyone that is learning the C programming language.  It also seems like it would be a quick, handy reference for those who may not use the language day to day.

030788743X|5.0|This book rocks. You can pretty much read the summaries above and a handful of reviews and you'll know whether or not you'll love this book. I forget where I heard about it but once I read that the author, Ernest Cline, loved Rush and a ton of other 80's pop culture staples that I did as well, I had to read this. And I TOTALLY LOVED every minute of it. Great, fun read!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I read all the glowing reviews.  It is highly touted in the forums.  And let's be honest, I really love some angst and bad boys. But for a variety of reasons, the book just didn't do it for me. I kept waiting for it to get better.  It didn't, and I was left kind of scratching my head over all the glowing praise it's been getting.  So, my gripes, in a handy dandy list (in no particular order):<br /><br />1. The plot was unrealistic.  Reading is a form of escapism, I get that.  But c'mon!  Travis has Einstein's brains and The Rock's brawn.  In isolation, I could maybe buy into that.  But throw in the other nonsense, and you lose me.  A few examples:  Travis *never* loses a fight.  Women fall all over him everywhere he goes (what is he, The Fonz?).  He inexplicably becomes obsessed with Abby after their first meeting.  The hot water breaks in her dorm, so she and her BFF move in with Travis and his BFF, flirting and non-sexual sleeping ensues.  Really?!  Hundreds of kids crowd into a basement to watch a fight, the place burns down, Abby and gang barely escaping with their lives.  Abby's dad is a (questionably successful) professional poker player with big gambling debts, so they go to Vegas so Abby can exercise her own formidable gambling skills, win some money and save the day.  Enter the mob (yes, the mob), and blah blah blah.  I'm legitimately surprised I finished the book.<br /><br />2. The book was way, way, way too long.  The pacing was terrible; someone needed to edit the work, and reign the author in.  Over 350 pages was about 150 too many.  But I guess she needed that much space to fit all the contrived plot devices and crap.<br /><br />3. All the weird names are ridiculous.  Unless you're writing fantasy or paranormal (are those the same thing?), more than one quirky name is overkill.  And then the quirky names all get shortened to nicknames.  And even nicknames get nicknames (Pidge for Pigeon, anyone?).<br /><br />4. The spelling and grammar were pretty bad.  I think I read somewhere that corrections have since been made.  I can only hope so.<br /><br />5. I never thought I'd say this, but there's TOO. MUCH. DRAMA.  They love each other, a boy looks at her, they fight, they break up, Travis breaks stuff, someone cries, they have a heart-to heart, they get back together.  Rinse and repeat.  Ad nauseam.<br /><br />6.  Travis has serious anger issues.  Between the I-don't-need-to-work-out-muscles, and the violence, I'm pretty sure he's on steroids.<br /><br />7.  Are these people in high school?!  They have lunch at the same time every day, at the same table.  Maybe they go to a cooler college than I went to...<br /><br />In short, I don't think it lives up to the hype.  Save your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun to play..I will sit here and playwheni havenothin better to do..  my son plays it as well.. its not a bad game..
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Chances are, you heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, and heard what a \\"flop\\" it was. Well, you should've ignored all of that and gone to see this film in 3D IMAX, because it's great and audiences around the world actually enjoyed it a lot. Probably because they didn't have an echo-chamber of bad press doing its best to sink the film's box office chances domestically. Whatever the case, \\"John Carter\\" currently has $270 million in worldwide box office, $200 million of that from foreign theaters.<br /><br />The point is, a lot of people actually did like this movie, and if it weren't for the large budget, its $270 million box office return would be considered objectively a sign of popularity. Alas, the campaign against it has already done its job, and anyone pointing out how good the film really was or how dishonest and hyperbolic the negative press tended to be, gets shouted down by claims the movie was the worst flop in history and everyone hated it and so on.<br /><br />But it doesn't matter what's really true about what happened previously, it doesn't matter if the film's box office and DVD/Blu-ray sales & rentals will combine for easily more than $300 million, it doesn't matter if the claims of a $200 million write-down were perhaps an overstatement, and it doesn't matter if there's a very big and loyal fanbase for this movie. None of that matters anymore.<br /><br />What matters NOW is very simple: This is a great movie, and this DVD/Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray/Digital combo pack, including deleted scenes and bloopers and commentary tracks, is your chance to see the truth about the film and why it has such a big fanbase worldwide. This film is based on the original John Carter character and his adventures on Mars, which were published about 100 years ago and became the inspiration for \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Avatar,\\" \\"Flash Gordon,\\" and most modern sci-fi adventure movies, books, comics, and TV shows. The effects are exceptional, the CGI characters are more realisticthan just about any I've seen so far on film, it builds an entire world of aliens with different cultures and history, and it has not only a strong male lead but also a strong female lead as well.<br /><br />It's a wonderful film for sci-fi fans, fantasy fans, and action-adventure fans, in a movie for adults and kids alike. I highly recommend it, so if you're a fan already or you are among those who didn't see the movie in theaters, now's your chance to enjoy the best film of the year you haven't seen!
B000SEI230|5.0|this is a really great book. if you like melancholy books, you will love this book, just like I do.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The movie was very well done and did the book great justice !!!!!  Rooney should have won best actress !!!!!!
B000DZ6VAK|3.0|A wonderful performance by Mitsuko Uchida is marred by very poor sound engineering. If there were longer samples on the Amazon site which included more piano, instead of just the random sound bites, I would not have purchased the CDs. It's a shame that greater attention wasn't given to overall sound including the muffled piano. Seems as if the brightness is filtered out. Why did they make the sound so dull? The Mozart: Piano Concertos (Complete), Vol. 1 and 2, with Jenö Jandó are fantastic and are why I want to hear other interpretations. Don't know what they where thinking but it is what it is. Nevertheless, I will enjoy Uchida's great talent.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was exceptional.  I read all the books as a kid, and decided to take my son to see it.  He loved it!  He could not understand what all the bad press was about.<br /><br />Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed!  Best 3d I have ever seen as well.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|I watch this movie several times a year. It reminds me to remember why I am so blessed , forgiven forever and loved. What my creator did for me is the ultimate. This year I watched it on Easter, took communion and enjoyed a blessed day. Thank you for making it possible on my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best Bible app for Kindle Fire! It has a wide selection of devotions which is very helpful for quiet time.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I've watched this movie many times but never tire of it.  There is something about the period that is captured so well, and despite the fact that this is not a mini-series, but only a regular length movie, I think it captures the essence of the story very well, and I enjoy it as much as the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice.  The actors and actresses seem so well fitted to their roles - it is a joy!

You have been warned and please someone get Ms James a thesaurus), I was surprised that this book isn't marketed as a Compendium of Medical Maladies.<br />Both protagonists seem to be in dire need of medical attention, only provided by a no doubt heavily compensated Ob/Gyn making a house call to \\"examine\\" Anastasia to put her on the Pill and ensure poor Chris Grey doesn't have to take his sexual pleasure through a wrapper. This visit does nothing to treat our clueless, virginal and vapid heroine for her multiple personality disorder since her Inner Goddess, Conscience and her Lacklustre Personality are constantly at war, which her Goddess usually wins, her terrible problem with intermittent respiratory failure during which her breath \\"hitches\\" (whatever that means) and she even has to be reminded to breathe..one hopes Chris has an oxygen tank stashed in the corner of his Room of Pain. And of course, she suffers more hot flushes than an entire menopause specialist's waiting room, has involuntary muscle spasms in her lower abdomen suggestive of chronic appendicitis and has an unfortunate tendency to dissociate into a million pieces at crucial moments. Sexy? Not.<br />And let's not forget our hero, a hyper-rich-without-ever-seeming-to-do-any-work, sadist and egomaniac who is a walking textbook of psychiatric disorders from the obvious sadism to the classic Narcissism which dominates him and his uber-control-freak need to subjugate the hapless Ana. Don't these people ever go out to the movies or for a quick latte?<br />Maybe Ms James will have learned how to write and ring the changes on her descriptions of \\"inventive\\" sex which are boringly pedestrian after the intial involuntary stomach clenching reduces our heroine to a gibbering blob of sensory overload. She will have to in order to keep this middle-aged \\"Soccer Mom\\" interested.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have it on my phone and now they finally made it for the kindle fire. The only thing is the yellow looks like a darker yellow. Which I get since it is basically just like words with friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book of the series.  I suggest also buying the 3rd book in the series, Mockingjay, because you won't be able to stand a second between finish the 2nd book and starting the 3rd book!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|wonderful game to play<br />wonderful graphics and tests ur skills<br />also sharpen ur observation and analytical skills.<br />great game for any age group.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|at around wave 16 mine started glitching. I could only fire the bow and hit them a certain number of times. also I can only take one hit and then I die.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|This movie was not just average in every way.  It takes every robbery/heist cliche and lessens the lackluster enjoyability of most in this genre by about 90%.  I believe this movie would be called a piece of crap.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|When I got this game and started downloading it I went to the comments and pellet said that this game is waste of time. Well, those people are wrong this game is cool:)
0439023491|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down, finished the 2nd book within 2 days. Would recommend the trilogy to friends and family.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really like the peaceful rhythm of the games.  it keeps you interested without setting a manic pace. good on my HTC amaze.
0345803485|2.0|James and her editor needed to employ a thesaurus and take a writing class before putting this very poorly written soft core porn turned mild S&M \\"indecent proposal\\" story line to print.<br /><br />Every other sentence contains one of the following words or phrase:<br /><br />I/he/she frowns<br />I bite my lip<br />I/he murmurs or mutters<br />I flush<br />Gray eyes<br />I/he/she roll my eyes<br />Heady<br />Taciturn<br />Shades of...<br />I scowl<br />I/he/she cock my head<br />My sex<br />My inner goddess<br /><br />This fictional crap could have 100 page shorter if all of the above repetivness had been eliminated.<br /><br />I guess if you're a mom with no sex life (or education) you might find this book entertaining.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|What is going on with the timers?!?!?!  Cant even play the game! I would like to give it five but I cant. I really liked the game until this happened! plus the energy goes to fast. It takes to long to renew. I refuse to pay real money for fake items. I don't mind paying for a game but that's it.  I'm glad this game is free. I guess you get what you pay for.
0440237688|3.0|If you aren't interested in getting bored then don't read this book with a CD. I am ready this in my 8th grade class and yesterday we read with the CD and I got really bored. But all in all this book is a really good book for a silent read. So I definitely suggest this book who likes to read.
0394806220|2.0|First let me start by saying I love this story, I specifically went out of my way to find it for my son. The story its self deserves a 5 star rating but how in the world did I end up with a new never opened book with Marker on the front of it. Its green and I am very upset with this. I will update my review if this is rectified but right now I am NOT HAPPY.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I cant visit friends villiages which is stopin me from moving on to the next mission it sucks 5 star definitely. if the fix
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Yay. its finally on Kindle Fire, I no longer have to play a lame substitute swf so get the original!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I loved the game until the glitches started.  I agree with everyone please update this game. It would be an awesome(ly)  (if that was a word)  fun game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|who would have thought that with all the apps out there, solitaire is still my favorite game to play!  great app, works extremely well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game because it is kinda difficult&hellip;But it is very addicting:) I gave it a 5 star rating because I like adventorous games
B0001I561E|5.0|My three year old princess went on her own magic carpet ride. She loves Princess Jazmine and all the characters in Aladdin.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|This cover offers great protection for my kindle, and I like that the stilus can be attached.  I have been unable to get it to actually hold my kindle up on a table top.  Maybe I have to work at it more. The leather is nice looking and soft to touch.  I need a holder too--and a screen cover--wish that had been included.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Just received this by mail yesterday. My daughter and I grabbed popcorn and sat side by side to watch it. Love our moments together with her Disney movies.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Glad I found this book, it was a great read with a powerful story.  I have to admit I read this story because of the comparisons to Fifty Shades.  However, I have to say the only similarities I noted were the way the story is told from Eva's, the female protagonist's point of view and Gideon the male protagonist was billionaire wealthy.  I felt this book was darker than books I have previously read, because both Eva and Gideon were deeply and painfully abused, Eva in childhood and I am assuming Gideon's abuse was a well.  Gideon's abuse and to what extent has not been revealed yet, maybe it will be in the sequel.  Their pasts add so much drama to their relationship, but eventually they always find their way back to each other because of their deep love.  This is the type of book that stays with you long after you have read it.
B00004R99J|5.0|I had this in VHS when I was a small child. Now I have a three year old. She is my princess and she loves the Disney DVDs collection I have started for her.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|This might be the best jazz album ever released on Blue Note Records. It truly captures the essence of being and feeling \\"blue\\" and it sounds perfect remastered. This is the perfect album to introduce yourself to the Blue Note jazz canon. If you love jazz, then you better buy yourself a copy of this!
B004X75RK4|4.0|I wouldn't tell anybody that I watched this movie, but it was very good.  The male lead is not overwhelmed by Sandra Bullock, he's a good actor and has some talent of his own.  The story is good and it's pretty funny.  Nice story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased and read this book since so many had been raving about it. I don't normally even post reviews, especially negative ones, but felt it was warranted this time. I know this started as Fan Fiction so honestly that is not my problem with the book. My issue is that this is the first book I have ever read in which I felt zero, absolutely zero, connection to or feelings for any character in the book. Didn't care at all what happened one way or another. I felt the characters and entire story line were poorly developed and frankly not very believable. I had to force myself to finish this book. Even the \\"erotic\\" scenes couldn't hold my attention. Poorly written in my opinion.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|This one will surprise you with the story and the dialogue is good throughout.  One thing that will turn me off of a movie very quick is stupid dialogue--people saying things that don't make sense, that are just dumb, and that nobody would say in any real situation.  But the people who wrote this one were talented and probably put a lot of work into making the movie solid.  They might have overdone it a little bit with him being all quiet and smiling at the girl, but it wasn't tedious.  Also, the director put some extra art into it.  The music, the cars, and some of the lighting is reminiscent of an 80's movie.  It's good.  There is graphic violence but there's no sex, which I appreciate; the movie was good enough that they didn't feel they had to resort to making it a cheap peep show like a lot of them will.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Like many others I too read Fifty Shades and was looking for something more just like it. A friend came across this book and we both started reading it together. This is a great book due to the fact the story is more believable on so many levels. It has the same quality as Fifty Shades but the story and the characters emotions seem to be more realistic.  October could not come soon enough for the second book. If you are in the mood for a new book here is on for you.
B00007JRQB|5.0|Three early Dylan Classics. He is probably the greatest musician,singer, songwriter in our lifetime.This collector item is an Austrailian deluxe package.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It's okay.This app keeps shutting down. I recomend it for someone who has a lot of patience. I can get some songs I can't get anywhere else
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Playing on: HTC Droid Incredible 2<br />(So 3 stars are &quot;it's ok&quot; and 4 are &quot;I like it&quot; I wish 3 stars was I like it. 4 should be, &quot;Love it&quot; and 5 should be &quot;Best Game Ever&quot; or something like that.) Anyway, moving on...<br />Ok, this game is fun; have been playing for about 30 mins with no problems. The one thing I would personally like to make this game a 4 or 4.5 was if I could swing the sword manually instead of my samurai doing it automatically. Or at very least, the option to decide. Aside from that I really like this game and barring any unseen tech issues or something, I will keep this game. Thank you developers.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|i really enjoy playing this game but there are a lot of glitches. when I contacted the team via facebook I was advised to send a private message with my email address. I expected to hear back but never received a response. its a shame because the game really is fun...but the glitches are really too much.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read all of the trilogy very quickly as the love story between Christian and Ana was so engrossing.  I loved getting to know both of their characters so well, and the sex didn't bother me at all.  However ... the books are very poorly written.  The language is juvenile and oh so repetitive.  The saving grace is definitely the love story itself.  Made me want my own Christian -- in vanilla form though!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Started reading Book#1 at 6pm; finished at 2am! Read three books in three days. EVERYONE should read these books. Gives you insight and hope for the future. A must read before you see the movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is an inventive game that is challenging. controls are stiff and make it hard to get long flights but that is what makes it fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|well done...its enjoyable a little tricky on. the fire but works well...I will def continue until I get bored with it...but at this rate I wont
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this game was fun, the graphics were cool...it was definitely different than the usual hidden object game, the price was great...overall great game! quite enjoyable!!! :)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Better than i expected and after the last book...anyway i hope that the interesting ending portends good things for the next one.  The three stars is for an endless morass of plodding in the middle while tyrion tries to get to daenarys and daenarys lusts after pretty boy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded on my kindle fire absolutely love it. Loads of fun can never seem to put it down. Works great on the fire. Never any issues.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good times. Kind of wait game. To get enough energy kind of game. You could buy energy for real cash, or just wait.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so much fun! you really need to download this app if you need something to do and don't just want to play the same game
0545265355|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games and getting this boxed set was a great idea.  It was brand new and only $30 with free shipping!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I ABSOLUTELEY LOVE THIS GAME!! It reminds me of a more complex PvZ. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! ITS WORTH YOUR TIME!
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I have seen way better movies than this and still can't figure out what all the fuss is about this movie. I thought it was boring and made no sense what so ever. Wasted my money
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is the oringinal angry birds.it will never get old.a few adds but really no biggie.so its free. get this app get it!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|the book was great i loved this whole series it was sapencefull i loved all the new people that come and just the whole book the death cure
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|ah,hm,and blah!those were my responses to some of the levels on this game.its free,but filled with adds.the concept behind this variation of the oringinal angry birds,but this includes the times and holidays of the year.it freezes sometimes and just drops off my tablet.so I would recommend this game just for the sake of saying I got the whole angry birds collection.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|do not leave the game if you bought a baby beacause if your not there to hatch it it leaves
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was so good I can't wait to c the movie? I also have the 2 books for the end of the serious.  Hope they are as good.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|entertaining game.. I like the fact that its Oregon trail and brings memories of childhood.. fun and keeps you occupied...
B005723JSQ|5.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan, and this one lives up to my expectations!  With crazy, laugh-out-loud situations that the main character gets herself into, and believable characters and heart-warming romance... it has everything I want in a fast, fun read!
0307956350|2.0|Simply, too boring and wordy. All the French phrase meant nothing to me. I didn't think this book was worth to be in the top 10.
1401937268|5.0|Especially ME! I have to say that this reviewer very graciously and respectfully defers to Kevin for his most detailed and accurate depiction of this stunning deck. For years I have personally been using the Robin Wood tarot deck from the early 90's ( and is another wonderful deck to check out for comparison just to see). I think I have found the replacement rather consessionally, as that earlier one is a tough one to replace/follow.<br /><br />I think I can add some things of note to the person with more than a passing familairity with Ritual Magic(k).  This deck ACCURATELY corresponds with the colours, and art, as well as the placement of the elements into the seasons/quarters that make up the seasonal year. These are:<br /><br />Spirit=purple, the beginning and ending of all things, and thus is embodied in the Major Arcana.<br /><br />Fire=red, Spring Equinox, Alban Eiller in druid lore, the beginning of all things living, the explosive and fiery 'big bang' gives the push into the life on the earth plane. East quarter<br /><br />Water=turquise, Summer Solstice, Alban Heffyn, the waters of life in the fullness of growth. South quarter.<br /><br />Air=dark blue, Autumnal Equinox,  Alban Elved, (Au-Tum) and the joy of the setting sun, the time of transition and evolution into that which must come, and this is represented very positively and lovingly, with none of the harshness applied to realities we all must face. West Quarter.<br /><br />Earth=hunter green, Winter Solstice, Alban Arthan, the season of midnight and the rebirth of the sun, hence growth begins again and the connection to our early exsistance is thus a focus. North quarter.<br /><br />I highly recommend this deck for all those who are already fans of Doreen Virtue (this is yet another addition to her fine series of oracle decks and will surely NOT dissapoint), as well as anyone who is in touch with angels of all kinds.
B006T5FDLG|2.0|Not the Best of metallica....guess why these songs didn't make the original cut.....songs are too much like St. Anger and Load and Re-load....

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have ben waiting to play this on my kindle and when it wasn't I had to use my dads iphone.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading 50 shades I have a burning desire to reread Tess of the D'urbervilles, Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier and also can't stop thinking of the Beaty and the Beast story. Also in connection with the deep psychological roots of \\"50 shades\\" - an interesting book to review would be \\"Arousal - secret logic of sexual fantasies\\" by Michael Bader. E L James wrote MORE than an erotic novel - it's masculine vs feminine in its raw, the Psychology of love with the capital P, it's about true compassion, understanding each other, motherhood, unconditional Love and Light. Those of critics who labeled it as \\"mommy porn\\" should be ashamed of themselves. And learn how to read the Text. And by the way what about the references of Christianity in the book??? Christian, Grace, cross in the Red Room, saving Christian from the darkness and joining Ana  in the Light??? Is that part of the \\"mommy porn\\" too??? I really think this book is much much deeper than it seems at the first glance. Read it yourself and then listen to what critics say. THIS BOOK IS MORE!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play Draw Something Free on my moms iphone but I'm so happy I can finally have it on my kindle. I saw it came out and my jaw literally dropped! this game is like Pictionary. you can play through Faceboook but you don't have to. there are ads b/c its free. GET THIS GAME! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
B00785P2QC|3.0|I do not like all the tapping for everything to be upgraded.  I also don't care for the goals that require me to spend money to accomplish. I paid for the app...I shouldn't have to spend anything else to play it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wondered about this book when I kept seeing it in the bestseller lists.  But I saw the negative comments and it made me think twice.  I wish I listened to my instinct then because I finally caved out of curiosity and bought the three books on kindle.  I am not a stranger to erotic fiction and bdsm is not really my thing but these books were so terribly written I wanted to throw my iPad across the room.  I skipped so many parts (the sexual scenes, mostly -- you read 1 or 2 and it's basically the same all over) that it was almost funny.<br /><br />The repetitive dialogue was unbelievable.  Ana's constant expressions of Holy ____ etc, the way she would say her best friend Kate's full name, the use of their names Ms. Steele, Mrs. Grey, Laters baby and everything else was too much!<br /><br />And this is what most 5 star readers consider really hot reading??  C'mon girls!  Try reading Sylvia Day's Bared to You and I dare you to say that this drivel is a lot better!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, ordered off Amazon because I couldn't wait to go to the store to get the 3rd book. Finished the second and needed to keep reading. Great series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|By far the most usable and versatile Bible app I've found. The rewards for following through on reading plans are kind of fun but I am not sure how I feel about the gamification of Bible reading! Only downside is that you can't always get to your Bible (you have to have an internet connection).
B00785P2QC|4.0|this app is really adicting, once you start you want want to stop. I gave it 4 stars because its fun, but the&quot;missions &quot; are too expensive in the game credits
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Loved this movie!!! Best movie I've seen in years!! Loved \\"Fireproof\\" but \\"Courgeous\\" is better!! Will watch it again and again!!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I usually dont like series of movies with the same plot and name. I atched the first three Mission Impossible movies before seeing this one. And I must say that this one was by far the best. I think it is a rare series that got better with each new addition.
B000002J09|3.0|Before starting, I realize that I'm walking into a mine field in daring to utter even the mildest criticism of one of the most revered albums in rock history, but as with Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\", and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", Led Zeppelin's most popular work and their best don't necessarily coincide. So, with my suit of armor firmly in place, a track-by-track breakdown:<br /><br />Black Dog - one of Jimmy Page's most famous riffs, and a typically heavy performance from Jones and Bonham, one of rock's definitive rhythm sections, but marred somewhat by inane lyrics from Robert Plant (a frequent Zep pitfall), and his tendency to screech instead of singing (ditto). 7/10<br /><br />Rock and Roll - another staple of Classic Rock radio, but that doesn't make it original, or even particularly notable as a song. This is basically just a standard Little Richard song with louder instrumentation, and the vocals an octave higher. 6/10<br /><br />The Battle of Evermore - A very nice change of pace from the first two numbers, featuring the late, great Sandy Denny as a guest vocalist. Thanks to the chiming mandolin, and Denny's presence, this is one of the few times Plant's Lord of the Rings references don't come off as twee, but his horribly pitchy and grating vocals near the end of the song mar what would otherwise be a masterpiece.  8/10<br /><br />Stairway to Heaven - objectively, what can be said about the song at this point? It's a masterpiece, it's pretentious rubbish, it's great, but played to death...? Rarely has people's mileage varied so much about the same piece of music. For myself, it's one of the band's greatest accomplishments, bustles in your hedgerow aside, and overlooking that the intro borrows heavily from Spirit's \\"Taurus\\", with Jimmy Page showing atypical restraint and taste in his playing, especially the melodic and dramatic solo.  10/10<br /><br />Misty Mountain Hop - Yet another Classic Rock radio favorite, but really not much of a song when all is said and done. This would rightly have been considered filler on any other early Zeppelin album. (It's also the fifth song in a row in A, which begins to get a bit tedious).  6/10<br /><br />Four Sticks - Zeppelin at their darkest and weirdest, this is probably the least known song on the album, but also one of the most interesting musically. Plant's voice never really comes down from the hysteria range on this one, but in context, it works.  9/10<br /><br />Going to California - What can be said? A truly beautiful song, even if the lyrics verge into cringe-worthy hippie-dippy territory.  8/10<br /><br />When the Levee Breaks - One of Zep's last outright thefts of an old blues tune (\\"Page/Plant\\" indeed!), it's also one of their better ones. Bonham's drums on this (helped to no small degree by Page's engineering and microphone placement acumen) set the standard for heavy rock, and Plant's harp playing doesn't suck.  8/10<br /><br />So, overall, that's a 77.5% rating, good for a B-, or somewhere between three and four stars. Not bad at all, but not the world-shaking masterpiece it's typically made out to be, and not Zeppelin's best album; any of the first three and Physical Graffiti are better.
1594744769|4.0|What can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said?  I bought this book some time ago on my kindle and put off reading it for one reason or another.  Once I finally got to and began reading I couldn't put it down.  In all fairness, the story doesn't actually begin discussing the home and the children in detail for a few chapters.  The story begins with Jacob who grows up hearing stories about Miss Peregrine and the peculiar children from his grandfather.  After his grandfather passes away Jacob finally visits the island and the home and is amazed by what he finds.<br /><br />Probably the most interesting part of the story for me was seeing the photographs.  It's fascinating that this story emerged from a collection of unrelated, old photographs.  I loved how they were included in the story and I was able to see what Jacob was seeing.<br /><br />There were some parts of the story that I felt could have used more explanation and I would have loved to have spent more time with the children themselves.  The ending did leave things a bit up in the air so hopefully there is a second book which explains some of those things a bit more.

1843106698|5.0|This is one of the first books about AS i read after my diagnosis. And it was exactly what I needed to learn more about myself and give me the solid answers for people who ask me about what AS is and how it affects me. Like a lot of people with AS it is hard to verbalize things on the spot. I have been able to highlight things about me and hand it off to a friend or my husband. If they ask... yeah giving it to people who don't ask it kind of a bad idea.. i know from experience. People will only understand you if they choose to understand you. The book is amazing because if you are in a hurry, hate to read, or just need a quick reference - there is a section in the back of each chapter called key points and strategies that just summarizes the entire chapter in bullet form. I've learned a lot about how to manage my emotions just by reading about how things affect me. Ignorance is NOT bliss. I don't think this is the only resource anyone ever needs as they continue to learn and discover more about AS, more books will come out. Also this is about AS a whole.. and although it talks about both males and females, it does tend to lean more towards the male side of AS. In addition to this book, if you are a woman with AS i recommend Rudy Simone books. But this book is irreplaceable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love it. Mario was my favorite as a kid and this is so much like it. one of the best free games available.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I think it adds weight to the already too heavy Kindle Fire. I am not sure if I want to keep the Kindle Fire.  The print on some things is too small and I always have to go get my eyeglasses.  Even with the glare proof thing i bought it is still very glary outdoors.
0061537969|5.0|I'm only on page 6 and one sentence I'm balling my eyes out and the next I'm laughing so hard I can't see to read.  Is the whole book going to be like this?  Up until a half hour ago I was comfortably emotionally numb, now I'm a wreck.  Maybe I'm just too much of a dog person, I had to quit reading \\"Cujo\\" when the Bible salesman kicked the dog to submission.  Doesn't help that the dog on the cover looks like my Lucy faithfully curled up at my feet.  Curse you Garth Stein I may need to up my bipolar meds to get through this.<br /><br />So, I wrote that first paragraph yesterday after getting the book off my front porch.  Finished reading about an hour ago.  I read that too fast.  I tried to go slowly, but I couldn't.  Enzo, the dog, thinks, \\"For me, a good story is all about setting up expectations and delivering on them in an exciting and surprising way.\\" which is just what Garth Stein has done.  Not a cute dog story the likes of \\"Look Who's Talking\\".  Amazing insight into how pet's think, at least how people like to think their pet's think.  I cried through the whole book, not for the emotionally weak, but then I cry at Disney movies too.  I only rated it a 4 star yesterday, \\"no race has ever been won in the first corner.\\"  Upped it to 5 stars today, a real winner!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Its up to the standards of Baldacci.  The pace is excellent and the hero fits all the characteristics of a guy I wouild like to follow over time.  The book left me wanting more to see further adventures and what happens to the smart, very worldly little girl.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|Hey I was blown away by the upscaling of the picture from what I was used to seeing in the past. On bluray the hills truly looked outstanding. I saw the reviews for this release but seeing for myself was truly believing. Some shots were a bit grainy but for a close to 50yr old movie who could really argue with the reproduction of this classic. This release could bring a whlole new cash flow for the company.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed it. It kept me interested. Not to hard for me with my M.S. Make some more for my kindle fire please.
0345803485|1.0|I saw a newspaper article raving about this book, and I ordered the whole trilogy without reading the reviews first. BIG mistake! I seriously want to send the author a thesaurus. She uses these college/post-college level vocabulary words, but she'll use the same one over and over and over again, like she just happened to stumble onto the word, liked it, wanted to sound intelligent, but doesn't know any other way to say it. It's so pathetically written that all I can do is scoff and raise my eyebrows, and it's so incredibly distracting that I can't find myself emotionally involved in the story. And I need all the concentration I can to be able to do that in the first place, because the plot line itself is a joke.<br /><br />The characters are painfully unrealistic; the 22-year-old virgin heroine who awkwardly stumbles, barely manages whispers and mumblings, and is confused every other page, somehow wins the heart of a multi-billionaire 26-year-old sadist who is perfect in every way imaginable. I laughed at the synopsis on the back cover when it said \\"Ana's quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit\\" won him over--Where do I find this \\"wit and independent spirit\\"??? She's constantly kicking herself for saying stupid things to him before thinking, blushing every other line, and swayed by everything Christian says, does, and wants her to do, say, and think-- Aren't these the exact polar opposite traits of what the back cover so deceivingly promised?<br /><br />I really tried to get through the book. I tried to overlook the flaws in writing technique and word choices during the sex scenes, just to enjoy it. But then her italic \\"Oh my\\"s and \\"Jeez\\"s just totally suck all sexiness out of the whole thing. It's set in year 2011 in Washington state, so why does she sound like some naive southern belle from before the civil war era?<br /><br />Take away the repetitive, old-fashioned writing style, the annoying italic \\"thoughts\\" (oh my, jeez, double crap, etc) that add nothing tothe story or the emotions, all the *bleep*ing blushing, and last but definitely not the least, the ridiculously unrealistic characters, and you are left with nothing but mediocre-at-best sex scenes.<br /><br />It's supposed to be an erotic adult novel. Erotic? It could have been, if it was written much, much better. Adult? Her writing style and characters are so juvenile that it's hard to believe a grown woman chose to write that way about those characters. So it's actually neither. I plan sell these back to a bookstore, and books 2 and 3 would not even have been opened.<br /><br />In a nutshell, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It made me laugh, it made me cry. It was the only realistic work of fiction about teenagers with cancer that presented them as multidimensional, intriguing, and compelling.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was a little wary of all the positive reviews of this fan-favorite series (I have been fooled before... ahem... Ready Player One), but I must say I was not let down. Quite the opposite, the series was entertaining and highly gripping, and I absolutely loved and was very much intrigued by the world that Hugh Howey has created. His depiction of the Silo and the \\"outside\\" is haunting, fascinating, claustrophobic, and dizzyingly expansive. There aren't as many different characters as one would expect from a series, but the ones that we meet will stick with you. There are no throw-away characters in the books; each one is developed with care and is attributed the amount of depth normally reserved for the main players.<br /><br />I enthusiastically encourage everyone to read these books, not just sci-fi fans. The pages will fly by, but the haunting and beautiful depictions will stick with you long after you've put them down.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I want to preface everything I say in this review with this: James's Fifty Shades series is the fast food of books. It is the breaded french fry of books. It is that perfect combination of salt, fat, and sugar that the body is designed to crave, even though you know it's not so good for your health-and you feel a little sick to your stomach afterwards.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it far more than I should have, considering the quality of the storytelling. Safe to say, not much happens in the first book, or the whole series for that matter--it is, primarily, a romantic drama, where nothing outside the sex and mutual cooing really seems to matter to the plot. I can probably sum up the synopsis for you in one sentence: Anastasia Steele is a hum-drum literature student who, by sheer happenstance, winds up in the talons of gorgeous billionaire Christian Grey. (Oh, and she falls for him, and he for her. Hard. I'm sure you're surprised.)<br /><br />There it is. That's the story. Add some obvious re-casting of Twilight characters, like Christian's handsome brother Elliot (see: Emmett), Ana's Mexican-American photographer pal Jos&eacute; (see: Jacob), throw in some BDSM, and you've essentially got a handle on Fifty Shades. It is repetitive at best, but only because James doesn't seem genuinely interested in any other aspects of the characters' lives outside this nuclear relationship.<br /><br />And yet, I'm going to give it a three-out-of-five rating. Why? Because it's smart. James knows her audience, and she plays to it with honest and relentless abandon. The dialogue is rife with clever quips; Anastasia's inner monologue is imaginative and for once, not distracting from the story; and for all its adverb-rich prose and predictability, (\\"I wear a face-splitting grin as I gaze longingly up into his wide, tortured eyes\\") I rarely found myself bored with the ups and downs of the plot.<br /><br />In fact, I couldn't put it down. There, in a nutshell, is why I give Fifty Shades of Grey a favorable review: it is simply unputdownable. You will groan at the tropes and roll your eyes at the same re-hashed sex scene, but in the end, I dare you to start this book and not finish it. Just remember before you pick it up, Twilight fan, that you will be exposed to a few hundred pages of all the missing erotica from Bella and Edward's love story, with a couple whips and paddles thrown in, before you really get to the good stuff. (James's brush-off treatment of the Jacobesque Jos&eacute; is, in my opinion, one of the larger disappointments.)<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget: Fifty Shades of Grey has been picked up by Universal's FOCUS studio for a hefty sum of $5 million. And James has reserved the dominatrix role in approving or vetoing casting, costumes, and more.I give Fifty Shades of Grey a favorable review: it is simply unputdownable.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I saw the preview for the movie made based on the first book of the trilogy I decided to read it before I saw it.  I realized it was a book written for young people and the hero was a 14 year old girl.  I am a 69 year old man and this is not the subject matter I normally seek out to read. The book is well written and touches on ageless themes that are of interest to anyone of any age.  The hero's life and hardships make her act much older than the average empty headed teen projected by TV and most movies of today.  The book is well written and a very fast read.  The second book is a little weaker than the first but the third book is again very entertaining and well worth the effort.  The violence of children killing children is present so some parental discretion should be exercised for very young readers.  I am looking forward to the subsequent movies I hear are to be made from books two and three.
B0050XFY4O|1.0|I expected more from this movie. The storyline could have been expanded on more and the music score was just prosaic.

B00753MBHA|3.0|I think this album is just fine. That's it. I loved Blood of the Nations. I saw as the \\"warm-up,\\" so not actually part of, Prog-Power 2010. They were BY FAR the best band that weekend. I was pretty amped to get their CD Blood of the Nations- great stuff! When it became available, I pre-ordered Stalingrad and received it the day it was officially released. I relisted it the next day.<br /><br />I'll now explain the title of my review, if really necessary....I also like Chris Isaak & Enya. HOWEVER, after purchasing more than 2 of their CDs, it becomes very obvious that once you own 1 cd from them, no other cd is really necessary, they're pretty much all the same. Can't really rip 'em apart, and if it's the first cd ya hear, it's great, but once you start listening to multiple releases, you realize that even though there might be a highlight here & there on whatever CD you're listening to, there's not really that much different from one CD to another.<br /><br />That being said, this Cd still romps all over most of metal CDs released in the last few years, BUT, as far as Accept goes, this is nothing more than \\"Blood of the Nations\\" DISC TWO.<br /><br />I think Mark Tornillo is an EXCELLENT singer- this is a match made in heaven- & Wolf's guitar pyrotechnics are impeccable, in concert I have NEVER seen a guitarist so AT EASE with his instrument, and I don't think it'd be possible to find another singer that could not only come close to Udo BUT also work off of what the rest of Accept are as musicians which was obviously influenced by UDO... in other words- Mark is the ONLY singer that Accept could have hired to move \\"forward.\\"  And they have moved forward with Blood of the Nations. We are now tracking horizontally. Is that a problem? As a fan of AC/DC, retrometal and the aforementioned non-metal artists, that answer is: NO. But get your life-jacket ready because the next album will decide whether or not we are in Spinal Tap Territory and if they are treading water in a......
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is a fun game. Nothing special but I like the quality of the graphics.  I'll keep playing until I get bored.  Similar to the style of game that FarmVille is.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Quite pleased thus far (completed the first chapter).  Price seems a good value.  Lacks the ability to enlarge search area, but hasn't been an impediment to solving puzzles.  Isn't as graphically derpy as some hidden object games I've played - so that's a plus.
B00701L5XS|4.0|The creators of this app have obviously put a lot of time into it. It is extremely clean and glitch free. The only reason I give it 4/5 is because it lacks some decorative knots such as the Solomon knot and the monkey's fist. Aside from that,  though, it is worth every penny. Especially if you have to teach other people.
0345803485|5.0|As soon as I got my books, I started reading, and instantly I was pulled into the life of Anastasia and Christian. I just wanted more.
B007CKNX28|4.0|If you are thinking of buying this disc because of \\"Sixteen Saltines\\", DON'T! The rest of the cd is NOT like that song. It's a very piano driven disc. I've been reading from alot of disappointed reviewers because this isn't so \\"typical\\" Jack White and all because they thought it would be, based on that song. Look on Spotify, Last FM, or Music Unlimited for free streams folks and KNOW what you are buying. It's not illegal and saves alot of disappointment. I will post my personal impressions after futher listens.

B00756GKBA|4.0|I am among these, who are trying to understand what is going on with Madonna nowadays. What happend to her sense of re-invention, the ability to set new standards?<br />MDNA arrived to my house more than a week ago and I've been listening to it one-two times a day.<br />But, let me start with what we can see and touch. What exactly Live Nation had in mind releasing this \\"deluxe edition\\"???<br />What I got is a cd with a booklet that has got VERY poor quality. The deluxe version is really worth laugh! They even included the same version of \\"GAYL\\" that can be found on the mediocre single:(<br /><br />I was always eager to spend more cash on special editions (remember the cool \\"Music\\" cd? Or \\"Hard Candy\\" with candies inside?). What Madonna delivers in 2012 is nothing special :( The quality of print is really unacceptable! It's not only the photoshoped Madonna that puts me off, but there are black spots in some of the pics (my cd came sealed). This is one of the reasons I would never give it 5 stars.<br />But coming back to music. MDNA is a decent album, but it seems as if Madonna went with the flow. In my opinion she releases music just to fullfill her contract. Remember the \\"promo\\" campaign of \\"Celebration\\"? Yep, how can you remember something that never happend? In this case is a bit similar. \\"Give me all your..\\" is just a song. Good enough to be a single, but 3rd-4th in a row. The sale shows that she shouldn't have bothered. SuperBowl? Amazing. Did it help? NO.<br />Check my review of the single. It hurts to see so poor releases by Madonna.<br />Neverthless, here come the reason why it's worth to buy MDNA.<br />\\"Girl gone wild\\" - a great dance number, should've been chosen as the 1-st single<br />\\"Gang bang\\" - grows on me with every next listening, as \\"I'm addicted\\" does.<br />\\"Turn up...\\", \\"Love spent\\", \\"Beautiful killer\\" (with its violin section) are very catchy too.<br />And the ballads. I like \\"Masterpiece\\" very much (it reminded me about another Madonna's masterpiece \\"Time stood still\\" which is one of the most wonderful songs she has ever sung). \\"Falling tree\\" reminds us why \\"Ray of light\\" album was such a hit. \\"I f... up\\" can easily joins the group and with the title changed a bit, could be promoted.<br />The rest is more or less o.k. And \\"more or less\\" is not enough to get 5 stars.<br /><br />To sum up. MDNA follows a bit \\"Confessions on the dancefloor\\", but lacks in consistency. Madonna always releases one amazing album in a decade (\\"Like a prayer '80, \\"Ray of light\\" '90, \\"COTDF\\" in '00).

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The first person present point of view made for a compelling first book, fast paced and immediate. By the second and third books however, the thread unravelled, as if the author didn't have a resolution in mind.  Also, in the end, I did not care for the main character! The protagonist does not seem to learn much about herself and is in denial about cruelty and injustice, love and humanity. A strange and deranged  heroine.  This trilogy feels like a single good book stretched into three for the sake of a sales package.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|In a lot of ways, sequels reveal more about the strength of the original than any amount of repeated viewings. Without the requisite introductions, meet-and-greet and initial character developments, the strength of the core cast is stripped bare. They're left to prove their worth in the great wide open, and what successes or failures they find can be a great judge of their quality. In Toy Story's case, Woody and Buzz's second adventure is definitive proof of what a deep, colorful yarn Pixar had actually sewn in their first feature-length effort. The troupe doesn't even stop for a breath as they plunge right into topics that range from emotional attachment and the importance of a family unit to isolation and abandonment. Of course, such weighty subjects aren't addressed pointedly; instead they're gracefully interwoven into the backdrop of a bright, rousing Incredible Journey-styled venture through the city in search of an important stolen toy. Stuffed with throwbacks that are sure to elicit cheery memories of the first picture, it's also loaded up with new material that's every bit as charming. Though I wouldn't quite put it on the same level as the original, and I felt that the messages of the recent third chapter are more poignant, it still sits near the top of Pixar's portfolio.

If you want to read all three books in the series, choose this one. Its perfect for the person on the go.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|The opening of the movie reminds me of \\"12 Monkeys\\" were a world wide epidemic is started by a person in an airplane. I really enjoyed the \\"geek\\" aspect of the movie as those who look at the virus infection do so from a logical, mathematical, scientific aspect as one might expect. We also have the personal aspect of people dying from the infection and their stories and of course the reporter/blogger who gets no respect. (My title is a line from the movie and is not to be considered my personal opinion.)<br /><br />As you can imagine, the virus structure is unique, it travels rapidly, and the body doesn't know how to handle it. Fortunately it has a short incubation period and acts like typical viruses, i.e. not spreading in colder environments. The movie centers on isolating infected people and trying to figure out the origin of the disease. It also deals with the more mundane aspects such as the specifics of burials, quarantines, irrational thinking, and big pharmaceutical companies. In doing so it jumps around a lot, with numerous subplots and no real central character. I believe this is done to give the audience \\"the feel\\" of the mobility of the virus, and world panic and not because the film director and editor are idiots. The movie also deals with the legal question of limits of \\"free\\" speech.<br /><br />I would classify the movie as sci-fi drama.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex or nudity.

B00013RC66|5.0|This is one of those brilliant films which does not get as much recognition as it should. The performances of Winger and Russell are captivating, as well as those of the relatively minor characters. The setting and the dialogue also add to a flawless piece of work.<br /><br />Synopsis: Winger, an ambitious federal agent, doing paperwork on a Mafia boss' death, and sick of her desk job, becomes intrigued with Ondine's Curse, a painless, nonviolent, death that occurs when sleeping. She then stumbles on a couple of similar cases where the now-wealthy widow suddenly disappears afterwards. She follows up several leads. One of them goes to Seattle, where she meets a potential victim, a good, shy, and kind wealthy newly married anthropologist. He dies soon thereafter and Winger blames herself for his death. She then follows the black widow to Hawaii to her next victim. The rest I leave up to the viewer in order not to spoil the movie further.<br /><br />Both women are portrayed as being very intelligent and driven. Winger is at first obsessed with leaving her desk job and later in catching the black widow. Russell is a master (mistress?) manipulator (who could have been a chess champion), but who nonetheless is \\"cracked.\\" She repeatedly states that she truly, honestly, loved all her previous husbands and her facial expressions accent her declarations. And, although calculating, she momentarily goes berserk whenever she realizes that somebody is on her trail.

B00003CXB6|3.0|If this film was original, perhaps it would have been perceived to be better than it is.  Unfortunately it will always be compared to the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" from 3 years earlier.  This film, also adapted from a Michael Crichton novel, doesn't pass the test but for one exception.  The Stan Winston dinosaurs are more plentiful and even more convincing.<br /><br />In this story we find out that while the original Jurassic Park and its animals were destroyed, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) had another nearby island where the actual cloning took place before the animals were removed to the park.  His company is now in bankruptcy and is run by his no-good nephew (Arliss Howard) who wants to capture and move the animals to San Diego.  So Hammond recruits Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) again to lead a crew who would photograph and document the animals before the evil nephew gets there.  Malcolm (a survivor from the first film) refuses to go until he is told his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) is already on the island.  So off he goes with 2 other crew members, Nick (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie (Richard Schiff).<br /><br />While the original kids, Lex and Tim, show up for a cameo appearance early in the film, they don't make the trip.  So the kid factor comes in the way of Malcolm's stowaway teenage daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester).  The fact that she's black and Malcolm isn't doesn't come up until Vaughn's character says to another, \\"does anyone see a family resemblance?\\"  So I guess that's addressed.<br /><br />There are some exciting scenes in this sequel.  One involves Sarah and Nick deciding to treat a baby T-Rex who has a broken leg.  They take it back to the trailer at the base camp.  Gee, neither of these scientists thought that perhaps the infants cries might attract mom and/or dad.  After ignoring the phone in the trailer that would have warned them of their obvious peril, dino-dad and mom let the scientists know what they thought of the idea of doctoring their kid.<br /><br />Except for a few humorous quips from Goldblum's character, the film is hampered by ridiculous dialog and even more ridiculous circumstances.  Some of these are the equivalent of the teenagers in a horror movie who don't leave the haunted house when they have a chance.  There is enough here however to recommend the film, albeit without much enthusiasm.<br /><br />For a much better presentation check out the Blu ray version available as part of the \\"Trilogy\\" package.  The visuals and the lossless soundtrack are spectacular.their kid.<br /><br />Except for a few humorous quips from Goldblum's character, the film is hampered by ridiculous dialog and even more ridiculous circumstances.

This book is filled with hate, murders,  acceptable rapes &amp; more. After reading it, I became an atheist. Actually I recommend this book to everyone. We can use some more atheists in this world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lots of Bible reading options and connections. You can take notes and highlight text. Being able to use the app without an Internet connection is a bonus. Also being able to read the different Bible versions with just a few clicks (taps) is nice. Reminders too!

0691152640|5.0|While the bulk of the reviews on the book are generally positive, there is a broad range of opinion. One interesting aspect that could influence response to this book may be the time lag in reading relative to its publication date (Sept 2009). As the global crisis has rolled on and evolved, the take home messages of this book have only been reinforced more and more. In fact, many of their predictions regarding the length and depth of the crisis that may have been considered overly dramatic and designed to enhance sales, have nevertheless been largely borne out. In fact, the subsequent Eurozone crisis (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, etc.) has been more than adequate confirmation of their overall conclusions.<br /><br />Although some of the concepts are dense and slow going, the later chapters that address current conditions are most illuminating. With the backdrop of hundreds of years of accumulated data and events, proper context is provided to appreciate the gravity of the current situation and the likely long term consequences the global economy can be expected to experience for at least another decade. In addition, the authors do an excellent job of pointing out limitations in past analyses and highlight those deficiencies that paint an incomplete picture.<br /><br />In general, economists tend to be rather pathetic at forecasting. This Time is Different has sufficient depth and breadth to articulate the \\"big picture\\" well enough to permit meaningful predictions.

0307949508|5.0|I came to know about this series due to the Hollywood movie version of the first book - Girl with the dragon tattoo. I then stepped into the books. I have not yet seen the Swedish version of the 3 films from the books. Would like to see how that compares to the book. In any case, this book is a page turner. Steig Larson keeps the pressure by running parallel story lines. There are several characters in the book but it does not at any point feel like overkill. There are several stories taking place - there is the Salander thread, Bloomkvist + Millenium thread, a thread on investigative journalism on prostitution, the bad guys thread, Police investigation thread - officer Bublanski & friends plus Salander's Guardian thread and much more. There is some side commentary on mathematics - salander's subject of interest and an initially holiday getaway trip in an island. If SL had been alive he could have created separate franchises on several of these strong characters. I can imagine a Bloomkvist - Millenium only series, a series with Bublanski and friends etc. The book is fast paced. There is no verbose usage of English; it is all plain reading and fast. The book took me a bit of time to get adjusted to all the Swedish names for streets and addresses. A cool ride. I am now reading the third book - girl who kicked the hornet's nest which is an episodic continuation of the story in the 2nd book. I feel bad that this wild story arc is going to end soon and there are going to be no more Salander-Bloomkvist books after this one since the author is no more. Amazing how such a topnotch thrilling story was written as a personal hobby project (probably with the intention of publishing at some point) and then posthumously published. I noticed on the book jacket that Steig Larson did provide all three manuscripts for publishing just before his tragic death.
B007CKNX28|1.0|When I first heard \\"Love Interruption\\" I got a little worried about this solo effort.  But then when I heard \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" my anticipation for this album grew tenfold.  However giving the full album a listen I'm very disappointed.  There is a huge void of signature crunchy Jack White guitar riffs ala Dead Weather/White Stripes.  Honestly this sounds like a Billie Joel album to me.  Which by no means is a bad thing, just not what I expected or wanted from Jack White.  Skip this one unless your into slow, piano driven, folksy songs.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Story is way too thin. I came across this book as a 'must read' in a magazine. So obvious. Two beautiful people, he's dominant she's in doubt whether to go with it but does it anyway because he's so strong. Maybe in the end it got better but I didn't make it that far before putting it away out of sheer boredom. At least Mickey Rourke in 9,5 weeks was strangely attractive which made him exciting!

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I have read my fair share of books on starting a business. As an engineer, the \\"building the product\\" part is the easy part. What has always challenged me is the entire process. Eric Ries was correct in saying that many books and magazine articles paint a wonderful picture of overnight success. And in my own business challenges, I wonder why I am not having this overnight success that I read about all of the time.<br /><br />Finally I have the answer. The overnight success is a myth. The Lean Startup by Eric Ries changes the perceived paradigm of business. 9 out of 10 startups fail. I personally have been in startups that failed and put it down to a learning experience but still could not pin point exactly what was the cause of the failure. Why didn't people purchase the products/services that I was creating.<br /><br />Am also a fan of Seth Godin and he professes that we build the Wow! into the product as a strategy.<br /><br />But Ash Muraya gets real and for the first time I truly understand why I have failed in the past with the startups that I had been involved in. It was the process. We never got out of the building. We always built software in a vaccuum smugly thinking it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I have used the latter strategy and I can say from sheer experience it does not work.<br /><br />It all makes sense now. Seems a little obvious now.<br /><br />This book in itself is lean. It does NOT make the same point over and over again using example after example. Every part of the book is useful. In fact it may be more of a user manual on business than a book. It shows you realistic step by step methods of reducing the time that could be potentially wasted in turning an idea into a product/service. I have already started to use the strategies and it is making a huge difference in my work.<br /><br />I have been through a process of creating an MVP and testing it. The process has already saved me tons of time and to be honest, much heartache.<br /><br />Every time I think of a new product or service I always go back to Running Lean to ensure that I do not repeat past mistakes and to use it's methods once again.<br /><br />Thank you Ash Muraya. It's one of the best books in this genre I have ever read.

630512762X|4.0|I've been on a bit of a Nicolas Cage binge lately and I found this one and decided to give it a shot. Warning, this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was good. The idea for the plot was pretty cool - switching identities. Why this had to be done by literally switching faces and not with masks is beyond me. I figured that'd be the easier, faster and less invasive method, but what fun would that be? Let's do totally unnecessary, stupid crap to make the movie more thrilling! In a nutshell, Castor Troy (Cage) shoots government agent Sean Archer (Travolta), accidentally killing Archer's son in the process. Archer is seeking revenge and kills Troy. Needs to talk to Troy's brother Pollux regarding the location of a ticking bomb in Los Angeles, so his colleagues propose the use of a radical, experimental surgery involving literally switching faces with Troy.<br /><br />Troy's body is being kept alive for the sole purpose of this face-switching surgery. How convenient. The faces of Archer and Troy are sliced off with lasers. No need to disconnect veins or nerves or anything - just slides right off like a slice of cheese. Now here's where I have a problem. Nicolas Cage and John Travolta have very different body structures: Cage has a slender face and a long nose, whereas Travolta has a more square face and a smaller nose. Their skin tones are not perfectly identical (close, but not perfect). Cage has a smaller frame and Travolta is chubby. Why are there absolutely no scars left after the laser reconnecting of the switched faces? I mean I know they just switched actors, but they are two actors who do not look alike. I don't think Cage's face would fit on Travolta's head.<br /><br />Anyway, turns out Castor Troy isn't really dead and violently rouses from not a near-death vegetative state, but a brief coma. He has the same surgeon who worked on Archer attach Archer's face to Troy's gaping hole formerly known as his face. Chaos ensues and Troy (posing as Archer) goes to Archer's house. He manages to gain a considerable amount of weight in less than a day to match Archer's body shape (translation: switched actors).<br /><br />Action scenes and stuff, Cage plays the role of an inmate AGAIN, and then you find out some sex buddy of Troy's had a son by him. A son that looks exactly like Archer's dead son (I think played by the same child actor). This becomes important later because Ms. Hump-n-Dump gets killed protecting Castor/Archer and tells him to care for her son. At the end of the movie, when Archer has his actual face back on, he brings this orphan home to his wife and teen daughter and says he wants to keep him. Not out of any goodness of his heart, but because the child is obviously meant to serve as a replacement for Archer's deceased son.<br /><br />Is it a bad film? No, of course not. It's got some great fight scenes, cool special effects, the sound is beautiful, the actors play their roles very well...they went a little nuts with the slow-motion action scenes, but whatever. It works. I guess the whole thing with the logic behind the surgery bothered me because I do this real stupid thing called \\"thinking\\" and I know this crap would never work. Not the way they depicted it anyway. If Travolta were to become Cage, highly invasive and extensive surgery would be required, not just peeling his face like an orange. They wouldn't need to show it all, but mentioning everything that is needed would have made that part better.<br /><br />So if you like Cage and/or Travolta and you don't look solely at the bad things, it's a pretty good movie. Honestly, I thought the errors were more funny than bad. They just stuck out like sore thumbs to me.cher) goes to Archer's house.

Not an indictment of the life style the book proposes, but a huge indictment of the bad writing; excruciatingly, slow plot and stereotyped, one-dimensional, stupid characters in this train wreck. Barf! Waste of time and money. Don't, Repeat don't buy it! I absolutely can not believe that Dr. Oz showcased this mess. Talk about loss of credibility. (P.S. I also want to choke the \\"Inner Goddess\\")
1594744769|5.0|I read a lot of books (average 40-45 a year). Out of all those books a few have stuck with me over the years. Lord of the flies, Harry Potter, The Road, The Bad Place. Those are some of the book that have stuck with me through the years. Now I am more than happy to add this book to that list. It was haunting yet exciting. I was worried at first where the story was leading but by the last lines of the book I wanted to read more. Many have wrote the summed up the plot in other reviews so I wont bother recapping the journey but this is one book that you must read.<br /><br />I know I am reading a good book when I think about it when going to bed, when I wake up and then throughout the day wondering what lies on those following pages. What images will the author embed in my mind and imagination that will keep me not only interested but excited to turn the page.<br /><br />For a first time author I hope he writes more books in this Peculiar universe he has so wonderfully created.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|True artistry and deeply felt acting propel the quiet drama of WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, a film about a boy who goes on a killing spree at his school. The son of Eva, a successful travel writer, and Franklin, a rather dopey and ineffectual husband, Kevin (played masterfully by three different young men, most notably the teen, Ezra Miller) is cold and intransigent. Even as a baby, he screams so relentlessly that Eva pauses by men working jack hammers just to get away from the noise of her son.<br /><br />The film is a menagerie of flashbacks, hazy images, and even segments that play very much like music videos. The tale jumps back and forth between Eva's current life as an ostracized (and often attacked) woman who can barely find a job (she wakes up to find her house covered in slashes of red paint, a color that is totemic for the film), and her previous life as a well-to-do mother and wife. As Eva struggles to live as a social pariah, she recounts the steps that led to Kevin's unthinkable behavior.<br /><br />The film is a pastiche of explanations and questions. It shows Eva experiencing not-so-motherly bursts of resentment toward her infant son. It also shows that son as being preternaturally smart and malicious. Eva is haunted constantly by the fear that she is not doing enough as a mother, but also that there is nothing she can do. The idea of Nature vs. Nurture is talked about a lot in connection with this movie, and for good reason, but it doesn't really seem like much of a debate in the film. Kevin, it seems, is clearly evil from the get-go.<br /><br />The real power of the film lies in Swinton's fascinating portrayal of the harried and horrified Eva. The boys who play Kevin in his various incarnations are all equally good, although -- as the one with the most screen time and lines -- Ezra Miller also shines. The complexity of Eva's relationship with her son is riveting, especially the parts of that relationship that manifest themselves after Kevin reveals his true nature to the world. Even knowing about and anticipating Kevin's murderous future does not diminish the impact of that moment of the film. I, for one, had my mouth hanging open. Even so, after that moment, Eva refuses to tear herself away from Kevin, and we finally see that the real message of the film isn't about what would cause a son to behave like Kevin, but what choices a parent has when faced with such horrendous offspring.<br /><br />Many viewers might be turned off by the film's slow pace, its often art-fogged cinematography, and its shattered-window structure. The movie requires a patient viewer, and one who is fascinated by truly resonant (if not downright ugly) characters. The movie is about a massacre, but don't expect a lot of blood and gore. Instead, the real horror can be found in Eva and Kevin's eyes, a mix of despair and coldness that left this viewer trembling in his seat.his true nature to the world.

B007H7XRLI|5.0|This is a great movie, the plot is ok, the actors are ok, the whole movie is OK, but altogether it is a great movie and pure escapism from start to finish, wonderful special effects, even follows a storyline which makes sense, the acting isn't wooden, although I couldn't name one actor in it, which, for me, means they were all pretty much average, and no one stuck out as stinking, but altogether the cast just works to lift the whole to a much greater level of skill than the parts they play as individuals, well worth $14.95 for a few hours of sheer releasing entertainment, and have already watched it again which makes it worth buying rather than just rent!

B0042L78MG|5.0|When I first heard the melodious sound and vibrant look of the music video for \\"A Night Like This\\", I was hooked.  Caro Emerald has swiftly joined a place in my highest musical tier.  Her music is simple, yet highly enjoyable.  Not only does she provide a musical sound that both pulls from the past yet has a new, edgy feel, she does it with a vivacity and sultriness that is reminiscent of the greatest jazz and barroom singers.  In a musical world obsessed with theatricality, exhibitionism, shock value, and almost pornographic costumes (or lack thereof), it is a breath of fresh air to see a talented woman who does not need to flaunt her skin or rely on pyrotechnics to hold her audience.<br />Brava, Caro!  I will be listening for a long time.
0743289692|5.0|Extremely interesting, informative, fair, and passionate biography. I simply could not stop reading. It is so much more than an incredible story of one woman's life; it is a heroic stand against the tyranny of Islam as practiced in so many countries. She spent her life analyzing the Quran's teachings and trying to justify those teachings with the physical and emotional abuse she received along with other females in the African Muslim countries she was born in and lived until early adulthood when she escaped an arranged marriage. The violence she endured as a child, simply because she was born female, and her rise to be a force in politics in Holland is just an amazing story.  Anybody who cannot give this book 5 stars is being petty, disingenuous, or will not acknowledge the truth, even when it is written so clearly by a person with first hand experience.<br /><br />Radical Islam is the biggest problem in the world today. I see relatively few positive ratings in Amazon from Muslims. The problem is a Muslim problem and it needs to be solved or at least discussed by Muslims, as she is advocating. She should be getting thousands of positive comments for speaking up and risking her life. Where are the feminists? Millions of women and children in the world are being abused (physically, emotionally, and mentally), how can anybody deny or ignore the facts? How is this not like the slavery issue in the 19th century? How can 21st century citizenry tolerate the ignorance and abusive practices of many centuries ago? How can any country afford to not allow any contributions (other than child bearing/housekeeping) of half of the adult population?<br />I have a lot of respect for Holland after reading this book, the system of government probably saved her life. However, as it turned out, she had to lie to get to stay in the country initially. She should have been treated as a national treasure; instead she found that politics is a nasty business.<br /><br />Hopefully, in the USA she can find a venue to lend her voice safely. There are so few that speak against the Islamists, and she has such a clear, intelligent, reasonable voice. These reviewers who claim that the problem is only a local cultural problem and not a global problem with Islam have their head in the sand.

Besides discussing some of her life in America and some interactions with distant relatives, she gives some possible solutions to problems with radical Islamists - another brilliant essay.to lend her voice safely. There are so few that speak against the Islamists, and she has such a clear, intelligent, reasonable voice. These reviewers who claim that the problem is only a local cultural problem and not a global problem with Islam have their head in the sand.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games my kids love it and so do I would recommend this for anyone with children. It is great for killing time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that You Version not only gives you access to a full range of daily reading plans (and other tools), it also let's you take several of your favorite versions of the Bible with you in your pocket. Nice!
0439023513|5.0|OMG!!  this is by far the best book of a great series.  this is the first book i have ever read in one sitting.  other than eating and an occasional bathroom break i didn't put this book down till it was done.  the charecters in this series are so well written and just when you think you know where the story is going you get slapped in the face with something that you never expected.  after i finished it i just sat there for like 10 min and didn't move or think of anything.  you get so connected to the book.  its unlike anything I've ever read
B004OEJMZM|5.0|This book starts off at the basics and explains every detail of the Linux Kernel. You should have some C background although it isn't necessary to understand it. I'm about 1/2 way through it, (yes I'm reading this book cover to cover) and it is very understandable. After I'm through I'll use it as a reference.
0439023483|5.0|i hadn't heard of the book till the movie came out and i did see the movie first.  that being said this was one of the best books I've ever read in this genre.  the way the story unfolds is absolutely perfect.  i never wanted to put the book down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this and am glad it finally on the kindle fire! Will get the paid verison at some point!

0439023521|5.0|Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down.  Not the best writing (but good enough), but Suzanne Collins is a master story teller.  I ended up reading the entire trilogy, and was not disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I received the trilogy as a gift from a friend who knows I love to read. I read the first book over the course of a week because I had to force myself to keep reading.<br /><br />It is poorly written, excessively repetitive (using the phrasing about the inner goddess and down *there* way too often) and frankly is nowhere near the scandal people seem to think it is.<br /><br />I realize it's a work of fantasy, but I've read better sex scenes in science fiction novels. It feels pandering. Honestly, there are much better books with steamy sex scenes if that's your thing, so invest in those instead of this. It's boring & massively over-hyped.
B004W89N72|2.0|I had high hopes for this product, but I guess I set my hopes too high. It's not as functional as I expected it to be; in fact, it's somewhat complicated to figure out. Not a fan. Uninstalled.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Brian Tracy did a great job of writing up 21 useful, straight to the point techniques for increasing your short and long term productivity.  Each chapter is only a few pages, yet is clear, useful, and easy to apply.  He doesn't waste your time with dozens of redundant paragraphs.  This book has definitely helped me stay focused and productive both at work and in life.<br /><br />My recommendation is to read one chapter at a time, spend a few days practicing what you learned, then repeat with the next chapter.  If you just read through in one sitting, you aren't likely to get much out of it.  If you aren't willing to try his time management and productivity techniques, then you are just wasting time and money.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Although they look bulky these fit great for extended periods. I've trashed numerous other brands that seemed fine at first only to squeeze your ears after an hour of continued use. The frame while bulky helps to keep the fit true for hours of extended use. Overall quality of sound, fit, and price makes this headset a must buy for gamers on a budget.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun I love it a lot in fact this much:  :dealt that much-it is that fun!!!!!!!!!REALY FUN A LOT

B007MNV5WU|4.0|I've purchased it and I love it definitely!!!!!<br />Only downfall is that it doesn't have enough game stages! I wish it had more game levels!!!! Hopefully they will make more!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun game download it. I literally just downloaded it and played for like am you're straight. It's worth your time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was awesome. It provided great entertainment. From lust to love to passion. The Christian Grey epidemic is only going to increase as these novels are made into movies. The books left you wanting more but in a good way.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|has potential but really a pain to do anything unless  you want to buy energy or wait every three min to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game because when I got it i didn't want to download too many games and then I remembered playing this on my friends phone and enjoyed winning the game for her. when I get bored I usually play this game and try to earn the rewards.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Overall I love the style and the puzzles are fun to solve but the music and sounds are what make me really enjoy this game.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Clary Fray is drawn further into the underworld of demons and Shadowhunters. Clary and Jace are both still struggling with the revelation that they are related. When her friend, Simon is also drawn into this world, Clary has to make a decision that will change his life forever. Will Clary and her friends be able to stop her father from carrying out his plan?<br /><br />This is the second book in The Mortal Instruments series. This is a fantastic series that kept me hooked from the first page! The story continues with the Shadowhunters doing what they do best - killing demons (or trying to!). I absolutely love all the characters! We get introduced to a whole host of other characters that Clary meets: Magnus Bane (a warlock), The Faerie Queen, Luke (a werewolf and Clary's mother's friend), Maia (another werewolf), Max (Isabelle and Alec's younger brother) and Raphael (the head vampire). We also get to see the world through the eyes of the other characters. The first book was mostly from Clary's point of view. This change of perspective gives the story a wider scope, and the reader a larger understanding of the characters and their world. There were some unanswered questions from the first book that were answered in this one. But there were also more questions raised as this story unfolded. However, the story has been so masterfully written that just when you think you've got an inkling as to what is happening, Cassandra Clare pulls the rug from under your feet! There were a few twists that I didn't see coming, but that just added to the excitement of reading this book! I highly recommend this book if you love a fast paced roller-coaster ride full of action and danger!
B0007GAERG|3.0|The product arrived just fine no problems there.  I did send an email to the seller asking if I they had the platinum edition and I could purchase that, pay the extra cost and return the first CD.  I've still not heard from them.  I am only rating the item 3 stars because of the shipping time and condition received.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a beautifully designed game.  along with its follow on game quell:reflect, this game has provided me with hours of quiet consideration.  in contrast to angry birds and friends,  quell encourages relaxation and thought.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I looooove this app. It allows you to download music into your internal storage, so you don't have to buy it in the app store. As for slowing my kindle fire down, I haven't really noticed anything. Get this app! You'll be satisfied, I PROMISE!! Its a free app, with free music download...Uhm where is the bad part?? Its wonderful ;)
0345803485|2.0|I did not know anything about the whole background story of to this book. I just downloaded it because I had read an article where it referred to the success and about how it was bringing 'mommy porn' to readers. Quite frankly, I do not get what all the buzz is about.<br /><br />I kept waiting for shocking, mind boggling things to pop up every time I turned a page but after half of the book I was so bored that I kept flipping through the pages that contained any situation of intercourse. Also, I felt like the story hardly moved along but kept repeating itself over and over and over again. Maybe I should have had a sip of wine every time certain sentences came up - that would have made it a whole lot more enjoyable!<br /><br />Character wise: I did not find Mister Gray dazzling at all, quite frankly I find him to be a major creep and the controlling issues always wanted to make me shout at the heroine. Or maybe smack her so she would come to her senses and grow a backbone.<br /><br />The writing style of the story (can you even call it that) does not scream experienced writer to me. Not saying that I could write a better novel but I have definitely read a whole lot of better written books.<br /><br />One positive thing I do have to mention: If you are a person who likes being able to touch the one you are with and be yourself around them this book will make you feel really appreciative about who you are with.<br /><br />Personally I would not recommend this book to any of my friends but I am sure your curiosity will get the best of you and you will have to decide for yourself.
0307352145|5.0|In our culture we take pride in being extroverted. From a young age we are taught to learn in groups and be outgoing because being social is good.<br /><br />Susan Cain talks about the other side and the fact that between a third and a half of all people are introverted. So if you always felt like the quiet odd man out because you wanted to be on your own, chances are there were a bunch of others feeling the same way. I really enjoyed Cain's writing style. I liked the studies and statistics, but appreicated that the whole book wasn't just filled with them. I gained a greated understanding of how intorverted people feel and think. I liked that she made a point saying that it is better than not everyone is extroverted and how introverts are often able to accomplish tasks that extroverts have trouble with.<br /><br />After reading this book I saw intorverts in a whole new light and I believe that it will give many introverts more confidence about themselves. In our society, it is considered \\"normal\\" to be extroverted. I think that this book helps give the understanding that it is normal to be introverted as well as extroverted; two different personality types that can work together to accomplish goals.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
0985114606|5.0|My Review:<br />Once again, I find myself with huge bags under my eyes because I stayed up way too late from becoming immersed in a wonderful book. I need to learn not to pick up the good ones late at night...LOL! And this was an amazingly good book, although I will admit I have a slight addendum to that statement at the end of this review.<br /><br />This book is about the romance between Eva and Gideon Cross. Eva has just moved to NYC with her best friend Cary from San Diego. She and Cary are both wounded, flawed characters who met in a support group. They have formed this friendship which has made them both stronger. They have become each other's support group because they know each other's history and their \\"triggers\\". Cary is a self-destructive, bi-sexual male, but I really liked his character and how he would call Eva on things when she was reacting. They're very good for each other.<br /><br />Immediately upon starting her new job, Eva meets Gideon. He's the owner of the building that she works in and she is immediately overwhelmed by his sexuality and power. He also feels a draw to her and propositions her almost immediately and extremely bluntly for sex. She turns him down flat. There are hints early on about her sexual abuse and that is a lot of her reasoning for staying away from him. She's obviously been through a lot of therapy and sees the warning signs of a relationship which is going to be bad for her mental state. But of course, you know there can't be a book if there's no relationship so she doesn't stay away from him for long.<br /><br />The problem...Gideon has his own sexual and mental scars, but it doesn't seem that he's been to therapy over them. There are still lots of issues here for him and you honestly never find out in this first book exactly what has happened to him. But as the reader, what you see of his nightmares are chilling. There are a couple of scenes where he is caught up in a nightmare, which are just so heartbreaking and foreboding.<br /><br />There is a ton of emotional depth to this story just because the Hero/heroine have such difficult emotional depths to them. It makes their relationship extremely volatile...both sexually and mentally. The writing on this is amazing and the entire book was completely riveting. I really loved the book and cannot wait until the next book in this series comes out because their story is nowhere close to being finished yet.<br /><br />My addendum:<br />I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy about ten days ago (my reviews will go up on the 30th) and couldn't help but notice the marked similarities between these books. That makes me slightly uncomfortable. The Fifty Shades author has been very upfront about the fact that Fifty Shades is fanfic of Twilight (although I truly don't see it...LOL.) I would just feel better about this book if there was some nod towards the Fifty Shades inspiration.<br /><br />As a writer, I can attest to the fact that writing a book is difficult. I don't care what kind of framework you are working around, it's difficult to get those words onto paper and do it well. This author has built a brilliant book that I loved, but she did it with someone else's framework. I just wish that was acknowledged somewhere. It would make me feel less guilty about enjoying this book and looking forward to the next book in the series.ding.<br /><br />There is a ton of emotional depth to this story just because the Hero/heroine have such difficult emotional depths to them.

B007WZ7ILK|5.0|I have been waiting for this like a kid for Christmas.  I figured that this would be a song that would work at reminicing and less a \\"modern\\" tune.  I worried that this would sound like a Brian Wilson solo tune, but there is a nice mix of voices (that we have not heard sing together for a long time) that makes this stand out.  Besides the harmonies, each vocal is heard on its own.<br /><br />Though this song will never be a #1 hit (in my humble opinion) it contains great harmonize, and a good nostalgic \\"sway,\\" when one listens to it.  For Beach Boy fans this is a must have.  For others it is still a very listenable tune.

B005LZW8FO|3.0|This movie was not what I expected.  Using the title \\"Another Earth\\" and through the previews, I thought its focus was going to be on the potential life on another planet.  It didn't really have anything to do with that.  That was simply the side back story going on behind the actual movie.  This movie is about a teenage girl who parties too hard and drives home intoxicated.  During this drive she's not paying attention at anything but the visible 2nd Earth in the night sky.  Because of this she collides with a car at a stoplight.  A husband and wife are driving home with their young son in the back seat.  The wife and child are killed.  The husband ends up in a coma and the teenager has to go to jail.  After a few years she's let out.  She's never quite the same.  She's aware what she did and didn't mean to, but has to live with that now.  Through research she discovers that the husband has come out of his coma and is alive.  She sets out to meet him and wants to make amends.  When she shows up at his door she gets cold feet and pretends she's offering housecleaning services instead.  This sets off the story of her relationship with this man that begins to grow more intimate.  She knows who he really is and he has no idea that she was responsible for his wife and kids death.  That's about all I'm going to say about it so as not to spoil it for those who still want to see it.  You get the gist of what it's about.  And \\"another Earth\\", um it makes a couple brief appearances in dialog, but unsure as to why it's called this since its more about these two people.  The other earth does play a small fraction of a part, but not a great enough one for me to fall in love with this.  I thought this was okay, but nothing special.

B0071WQ7WU|1.0|Why is this in the Hard Rock/Metal section?  This is clearly a Top-40, pop influenced, Chick/Butt Rock band.  Placing this in the same genre as High on Fire, Mastodon, or Baroness is a travesty against mankind as a whole.  This band, as well as bands like Nickelback, Three Days Grace, Seether etc. are closer to a genre that would encompass the likes of Rascall Flatts, Jessica Simpson, and Lil Wayne.  Please quit confusing your users by showing this as a valid response to \\"New Releases in Metal.\\" If I wanted Top-40 Pop Music, I would have searched for such.  Thank you.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes! This series is amazing. Collins has created true to life characters who stay with me way after I finished reading, and placed them in unbelievable situations. The scary part is, I could see them coming to pass. If you haven't read this series, or were scared off by the hype, give in! It is the best series I've read since Harry Potter.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones first season is one of the best series I have seen in a while. I can't wait for Game of Thrones season two to come out. Definately worth the wait.Not for the faint hearted or the young.
0141192429|5.0|I'll begin by admitting that I'm not much of one for reading horror or mystery novels. I started reading this book simply because it's a classic novel, and I've set about trying to read as many of the classics as I can. I came to ADORE this book though! I sincerely believe that it has got something for everyone. It has love, friendship, family (both good and bad relationships), horror, mystery, psychological game play, a gothic flair, compassion, loyalty, betrayal. All of these themes are perfectly balanced, and alternate enough that one theme doesn't become wearisome. The book is written as if several people are giving their eye witness accounts (along with personal sentiments) of events. Sometimes this can make a book hard to follow, but I actually really liked this format in this book. Everything is covered completely from several angles, and while it is easy to follow the reader still has to work to draw their own assumptions about the meaning of events without the help of a an overall narrator hand holding the reader through everything. The ending is neatly wrapped up and satisfying. I urge you to give this book a try, and see it through to the end (the last 40% of so of the book has the most action, while the begining is more of a very eloborate set up of relationships and circumstances...but this detailed set up is much needed).
1569242739|5.0|Let me just start off by saying these are the cupcakes by which I measure ALL other cupcakes.  The chocolate and vanilla cupcakes are far better than ones that I used to eat prior to going vegan.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking for some killer cruelty free recipes for vegan and omnivores alike.  I used recipes from this book for my son's birthday party and no one could tell the difference and I even got compliments that they were some of the best cupcakes the guest's had ever had!  Worth it's weight in gold, er...frosting.
B0055S348W|5.0|Easy to install on my Atrix 2 phone. Then it simply works! I have used it for about six months.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Oh my God. These books should come with a warning: starting reading these will cause you to lose weeks of your life as you won't be able to put them down! ... And you find yourself thinking about them when you can't read them and seeking out people who have read them so you can talk about them. Very hazardous!!!
1612130283|1.0|I got this book on my Kindle with no idea what the book was about- a friend had raved about it to the point that I thought, what the heck, I'll check it out.<br /><br />Within 20 pages, I was thinking, \\"boy, does this girl remind me of Bella Swan\\" - another protagonist who made me want to hurl my book/Kindle/leather crop collection across the room. By the time I was about six chapters in, I decided it wasn't a coincidence and got on Amazon to read the reviews. I wasn't in the least surprised to find out that this was fan fiction, but I sure am kicking myself for not getting on Amazon to read the reviews first.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you liked Twilight you'll probably love this, I found it to be about the same level of writing with just about the same semi-sympathetic, semi-idiotic main character, and a Handsome Tortured Hero/Villain. Will he save her or corrupt her beyond redemption? Someone else will have to fill me in because, like Twilight, this is 500+ pages of fun that I can't bring myself to finish.<br /><br />PS - yes, there's lots of sex, but I bit my lower lip and decided I could live without it. If you get through 30 pages of the book you'll know what I mean.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\" but the next two books in the trilogy were a redundant to the first book.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I love Madonna and in no way does this review change that but I have issues with her latest effort. This CD is all over the place and lacks the cohesion  of previous albums. MDNA feels like she had an identity crisis and was trying to give us a little of each Madonna from the 80s to 2000s. There are several good tracks on MDNA,  Girl Gone Wild is fun and a nice homage to her Erotica days.  Love Spent, Masterpiece, Im Addicted and Falling Free. The rest feels juvenile. Turn up the Radio just sounds like  double mint commercial or Mentos. Madonna spent several years after the release of Ray of Light asking the world who is that Madonna from Like a Virgin.  Several tracks sound like the came off the American Live album. Please stop rapping! Madonna is clearly angry over the end of her marriage and it is very clear I just don't think the creativity to express it came out well here.<br /><br />Ray of Light and Music  were more mature and exceeded boundaries set by traditional radio, Confessions was smart and fun. Madonna is best when trying to exceed these boundaries however she is not so great when she enters territory that trys to keep in tune with what's on the radio like her attempt with American Life and Hard Candy.<br /><br />I love William Orbits work with Madonna and when I heard she was working with him again I was excited. I think this time their collaboration did not work as well simply because the album was over produced and lacked directions. Not even Madonna can make the right decision every time. I would not count her out  yet. She has miss stepped before like on American Life or some may say Erotica I don't agree but one this is certain each time she has been counted out she comes back with something remarkable like Ray of Light.  I also do not agree she is too old that baffles me, she is 53 what of it. I challenge anyone to look that good and be that fit at 53 with her schedule.<br /><br />I will bet all I have that we will still be talking about Madonnain 10 years and her music. I like Gaga but let's get perspective, nothing popular today is that memorable or cutting edge. Let's see if anything memorable is coming from Gaga, Perry or Rheina in 10 years. What are Britney and Aguilera  doing today?
0439023513|4.0|Didn't like this book as much as the first 2, but still entertaining and enjoyable read.  Finished the entire series in just a few days and recommend them highly!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Was skeptical because plot was similar to battle royale. I am big on originality and the hunger games trilogy gave me just that.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie does what no other movie has ever done--presented the audience with a close depiction of SEAL operational reality through the eyes and actions of real active-duty service members who serve as the main characters in the movie.<br /><br />The scene in the South Pacific where SEAL Team 4 takes down Cristo's yacht is spectacular.  In addition, the dialog that immediately follows during the interrogation of Cristo by a Navy Senior Chief known as \\"Otto\\" is exceptionally well-done.  In some ways, this witty exchange aboard Cristo's recently-boarded yacht was one of the best in the movie.  The New York Times interviewed the actor that played \\"Cristo\\" in the film, Alex Veadov. The NY Times states:  For their fellow actors, there was, for instance, an immersion in a novel kind of Method acting. In one memorable scene a SEAL member known only as Senior Chief interrogates a Russian arms smuggler played by Alex Veadov.<br /><br />\\"He had just gotten back from Afghanistan,\\" Mr. Veadov said of Senior Chief. \\"At first it was O.K. As it progressed a little, and he starts throwing things around, it kind of became a little tense.<br /><br />\\"When he started speaking Croatian, though, it became freaky. I don't speak Croatian, but he must have looked me up on the Internet. I had done a play with a Croatian company. So he did research on me as an actor. And I was little bit intimidated. After all, this is what this guy does for a living.\\"<br /><br />Aviation tech is exceptional in the movie.  The surveillance of an airstrip in Somalia was breathtaking as a Grumman HU-16 Albatross seaplane swoops in followed by an unmarked Douglas DC-3 cargo plane.  The RQ-11 Raven drone plays a prominent role during a jungle personnel recovery.<br /><br />The producer reports that over 90% of the action sequences were filmed using \\"live fire.\\"<br /><br />Don't miss this movie.  It was filmed on a relatively low budget.  Directors Mike \\"Mouse\\" McCoy and Scott Waugh should be commended for theirefforts to bring us a technically accurate peak into the Navy SEALs way of life.  Reward their effort by going to see the movie in theaters and by buying the movie on DVD or Blu-ray.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the backdrops are epic.  Mexico, Puerto Rico, Ukraine, Cambodia, and Florida.  The explosion scene set in the Philippines (filmed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia) was said to have involved 300 child extras.<br /><br />Amazing.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Wow, this was a life saver for sure.  Had finally replaced an old model 27\\" Sony Wega TV after 15+ years.  Picked up a 42\\" LG Flat LED TV and realized after setup that I couldn't connect it to my again OLD Yamaha reciever amp and speakers.  LG tv had only a digital output which was not going to work with my current setup.  I searched online fo solutions to convert digital audio to analog L -R connections.<br /><br />Found this converter here after doing some homework and took a chance based on all previous comments.  Was just about ready to give up and purchase a current surround sound system.  My Yamaha reciever, although about 25 years old is still kicking and my speakers are in decent shape.  So with this small little gadget, I was able to get things up and running in like 5 minutes.  Now watching TV is a whole lot of  difference compared to the tiny weenie speakers that are located on the bottom of the LED screeen.  Still, maybe when ready, I will upgrade to a new entertainment system and retire my Yamaha but till then, save the couple hundred bucks and enjoy the large screen.<br /><br />Very pleased with how things setup so easily and functions perfectly without a hitch. Solved my problem today and would recommend anyone with similar situation to check this adapter out.  Suggest you connect the power to the TV directly through an open USB port since when you power off the TV, the adapter also turns off.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|i have been a fan of Baldacci for over 10 years and this is one of his easier to read books.  Quite enjoyable. The ending kept it from earning all 5 stars.
B007CKNX28|5.0|This a musical odyssey/oddity. Each song has a cohesive flow that makes you feel as though you MUST listen to the next song. I feel like I have just traveled through White's cerebral cortex. LISTEN TO ME (but mostly him).
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and time consuming. Great game for a car pool. The water drop its a grey idea with all the spikes.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is very fun...but confusing.  Its hard to learn how to play but you get used to it and then it is addicting!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased this book because I was curious about all the hype. Well, it's not a big deal, trust me. It's so unrealistic. The book describes a &#34;beautiful&#34; 21-year-old virgin who had never been kissed (yeah right!) who is seduced by a 28-year-old billionaire (yeah right) who appears to have the career and bedroom experience of a 40 - 50-year-old man/pervert. Okay, whatever! E.L. James, the author, did not need three books to tell this story. I am not going to put myself through two more books of silly explicit sex scenes on  every other page. The book had potential for a good plot, but the author blew it because of the overkill of such scenes. And it was ridiculous at the numerous times the quotes &#34;don't bite your lip&#34; or &#34;don't touch me&#34; were in the book. Silly read! I hope Dr. Flynn can help Christian Grey, but I'm not buying the other two books to find out the ending. Again, there was an underlying good plot, but the author was too focused on sex and the plot never really surfaced. The story could have been wrapped up in one book, if properly written.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|Really bad! All the other reviewers who gave it the lowest rating collectively have it right on the \\"attributes\\" of this B grade piece of ............ I predict that it will not even make it into the campy category before it is lost, intentionally for sure, in the bowels of time.

B004ZNAXX2|5.0|I bought and received this item the day it was released. Everything was intact and in mint shape. This was a dream come true for me, even though I already owned all the Wall demos, I got more then I ever knew existed. I hope they make an Immersion Box Set for every Floyd album, I will buy them all. But wouldn't it be even better if they sold these in vinyl format? CAN YOU IMAGINE?
0307279189|5.0|Chris's book tells a true story, with human characters in the deepest sense of the word, throughout the book he shows us what is natural running, presents scientific thesis, with  shocking results, just as an example, Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens living at the same time and what this implies in the running gait.<br /><br />The book is well written, entertaining, impossible to stop reading for any runner. Throughout the book, Chris is sharing his experience and that of other great runners like Caballo Blanco (White Horse, rest in peace) or Scott Jurek, among others and of course the big stars los Chihuahuenses Rar&aacute;muris, who are teaching lessons about running, not because they want to give us lessons, it's a conclusion throughout the story of these long-distance runners, that they have been for hundreds of years; they have been runners as part of their everyday life, they show us a diferent way of life,  which leads us to reflect on our own life.<br /><br />Gerardo Flores, Mexico City.

159514188X|2.0|The construct of the book (listening to the cassette tapes, the journey through the town and interspersing Clay's thoughts) was unique and interesting. But I put it down feeling more annoyed than sad. I cry pretty readily when moved, I did not cry at all while reading this book. Also, I recently experienced the suicide of a family friend, which I thought might make this book hard to read; it didn't. Mostly because Hannah (the main character) walks willingly into the worst situations in the book. She lets the hot tub scene happen, willingly. She pushes away the one guy who is nice to her, willingly. She skirts around her real intentions with teachers and friends, hoping they'll do something...what are they supposed to do? Yeah, I get the whole 'snowball effect' of what people did to her, knowingly and unknowingly, but come on. In short she was a weak character, and not one that was easy to like. I fully understand that high schoolers lack perspective, but it's a big world out there. There is war, poverty, famine, disease...hard to say what was so awful about her pretty intact life. Final note, for anyone thinking this is great reading for middle schoolers, there are a lot of sexual situations. Overall: Gag.
1401227821|5.0|Adam Hughes is one of the best artists alive. This book contains all his DC comics cover artworks. No doubt that it's perfect compilation for all (AH!, DC, comicbook) fans.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-AH!<br />-Perfect artworks from the pin-up master<br />-Beatiful clean hardcover book which totally matches with Adam Hughes style<br /><br />Cons:<br />-So good, so clean...<br /><br />5/5 - 9.5/10
B007G5K066|4.0|Not sure why all the 1 star reviews. Yes there was a lot going on with the timeline, and yes you had to pay attention. Overall though it was nice to see a movie that made you think and question what was going on. Too often you go to see a movie and it's something that spells out every last detail. It wasn't perfect, but it was different and I thought the acting and casting was very well done.
0345803485|2.0|First, let me thank the poor soul (a friend of mine) who bought this and allowed me to borrow it. Thank God I didn't waste my own $!<br /><br />If you want to read GOOD erotica, or GOOD BDSM, from someone who can actually write please read something by:<br />Joey W. Hill<br />Shiloh Walker<br />Tymber Dalton<br />Sophie Oak.<br /><br />NOT this!<br /><br />Weak everything from characters, plot (what plot?), editing, & poorly researched genre.<br /><br />The only reason there is so much hype about this book (trilogy) is because the author is a TV Executive. So what? That does not make you a worthy writer. I feel the author's connections got her sold and from reading other's reviews, most feel incredibly cheated.<br /><br />Frankly, Christian needed a swift kick in the a** & told to get over himself. A good D/s relationship is built on trust & exchange of power. The H/h did not have the knowledge or trust in each other, worthy of that type of relationship. Ana did not have the surety and confidence in herself to have ANY exchange of power with Christian at all.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I find this game very relaxing to play and fun at the same time. The sounds and lightening bolts really add to the overall feel of the game. Very cool game!
006197806X|5.0|It took me completely by surprise how good I found 'Pandemonium' - so good.<br /><br />'Delirium' is faster, action-packed, stronger. It's now clear 'Delirium' was only setting the stage, convincing the reader. I left off not quite liking Lena - I found that she was incredibly brainwashed, that she was weak.<br />In 'Pandemonium' we'll flash back and forth between Lena's \\"now\\" (when she's back inside the fences) and her \\"then\\" (when she's living in the Wilds) and I very much enjoyed following the two stories back-to-back. It was a great idea of Oliver to craft the story this way.<br /><br />The Wilds was believable and I could sense the cold and struggle through the pages, I also really liked that the book was set in New York - it was much wider, freer, the atmosphere definitely didn't feel as controlled or trapped as in Portland. There was more room to breathe. For the majority of the book, it barely felt like a dystopian society which I didn't mind.<br /><br />The whole plotline in 'Pandemonium' did contain a few flaws but generally had more space to move around in. Though I loved Lena's newfound egde, I found it a bit unbelievable that she'd gotten so invincible in all of her encounters. She was a little too much of a pro all of a sudden.<br /><br />To me, 'Pandemonium' was all about Lena's growth. She's made a 180 from where she left off, she's grown - I was shocked by her newfound strength.<br />In 'Pandemonium' Lena's been learning to survive in the Wilds, to live with everything she's left behind. She's tougher, edgier, stronger. I automatically compared her to Cammie from the 'Gallagher Girls' series by Ally Carter.<br /><br />I was heartbroken by how Lena held onto Alex, it actually made me like him so much more. Just the constant idea of him made me realize I needed him with Lena. Alex had been the reason for everything and it really mattered now that he wasn't around.<br /><br />[Minor spoilers!] How the deal with Julian was going to unfold was apparent. Some may have been bothered by the fact that Lena could fall in love with another guy so soon after supposedly losing Alex but considering the circumstances and the odd situations she found herself in with Julian, it wasn't out of the blue. Two people, forced to be with each other, and fearing for their lives, are bound to grow some kind of connection. I didn't feel any particular way about Julian but I didn't mind him either, he was just there. [Spoilers ended!]<br /><br />The end, sort of expected, had me totally excited. I'm dying to read the last installment! I need to know how things are going to turn out and I can't believe I'll have to wait until next year. Though, it's set in stone I'll read the third and last installment. How could I not with the cliffhanger Oliver presented?!<br /><br />Loved it? Yes<br />Will I read the rest of the series?

B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. It syncs flawlessly with my Gmail account, giving me instant access to both my calendar and my task list and it is very easy to use. I use it for my personal calendar, so I do not really need the full functionality I would want from an Outlook-type calendaring system. I am able to create repeating events, just not with all of the variations that those with bigger demands might need. Truly, though, I do use the repeating feature quite a lot and have only come across one variation I could not do - that is \\"on the last weekday of every month\\" - so it has a lot of flexibility in that area also. I love the click-and-drag feature that lets me easily move or copy events from one day to another. Finally this app has so many ways to customize and personalize your calendar that its amazing! You can change colors, fonts, font size, layouts - the list goes on and on. In that regard it is leaps and bounds better than the most sophisticated calendar system. I highly recommend!

B004WX1W0I|4.0|A lot of tape was spooled in France in a steaming hot basement in 1971 and there was more than enough to fill the 2 LP's that became the official Rolling Stones record: \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and this disc gives us a bit more from the two Mick's, Keith, Charlie, Bill and their friends Nicky Hopkins, Ian Stewart, Bobby Keys and Jim Price for a band indeed in exile but playing as good as any band ever would.<br /><br />The guitar interplay between Mick Taylor and Keith Richards is at it's peak here and Mick Jagger lays down some fantastic blues harp right outta the gate on the opening number: \\"Pass The Wine\\" (Sophia Loren) that sets the tone for what is to follow. Pass The Wine, is blues with a mission and this is the Rolling Stones playing right in their element as it's down and dirty and great to hear. \\"Following The River\\" is a Stones big-ballad driven by Nicky Hopkin's soild and graceful piano that builds and builds. \\"Dancing in the Light\\" takes us into country territory and is led by Keith's guitars (Mick Taylor, isn't playing on this cut) and Mick Jagger lays down a great vocal that removes \\"Light\\" from being another country-weeper and Charlie drives the beat with major attack.<br /><br />\\"So Divine\\" (Aladdin Story) takes the Paint it Black guitar riff and twists it sideways and is a real cool slow burn. There was a wealth of material recorded in France as this should have been placed on the original record as it deserves a place on there. \\"Plundered My Soul\\" again has a great interplay between Mick Taylor and Keith that shows just how well these two masters played together and Jagger sings the devil outta this one as well. \\"Plundered\\" is another keeeper as it's Stones gold unheard before this release showcases it. The piano of Nicky Hopkins raises the funk-level and barroom feeling on: \\"I'm Not Signifying\\" up by more than a few notches. Nicky (as always) adds so much to this music and he sets the feeling and tone here as The Stones are down and dirty (just the way we like em')<br /><br />Alternate versions of: \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\" are really great to hear on this new ratities disc as the sound of the original Exile LP's always sounded muddy and distant to my ears. And those original tracks have been described as a dirty-sounding recording by most it should be mentioned that Keith's vocal on 'Survivor' is a lot better than I remembered it to be. The horns are tasteful but not overpowering as they sometimes appear on Stones recordings. The guitars are mixed right up front and center and that is where they belong as the right moves were indeed made in keeping the sound modern but faithful to sounds the tapes of forty years ago.<br /><br />\\"Good Time Woman\\" is the germ that later turned into \\"Tumblin' Dice\\" and it's still good in it's original form but not as radio-friendly as 'Dice' would become but, this is another good find. Last up to bat is: \\"Title 5\\" one of the many jams from the basement that features only Charlie, Bill and Keith, and it's a showcase for multi-Keith guitars that we don't get to listen to all by their lonesome very often. I only wish a couple more instrumental jams could have been featured here on the rarities edition but, alas after this short number this disc is over.<br /><br />With ten tracks and 41 minutes of music here we have another Rolling Stones record of (mostly) unheard songs.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|I was disappointed with the film.  The transitions between the present and the past for Margaret Thatcher left me confused.  Was it intended to show the confusion she was living with?  I don't know, but to me the many movements from one time frame to another distracted me from the story itself.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins definitely crafted a little gem with this book.  My purchase of this novel is a classic tale: \\"Young adult best-seller which is about to be a movie - so read the book first.\\"  This book was such a quick and interesting read that I not only finished it in a few brief days, but prior to my seeing the film as well, I purchased and began to read the sequel(s).  Where the author chose to omit a number of details to maintain a \\"young adult\\" genre, she makes up for with perspective and subject matter.  The novel itself appears to be written primarily in fragment, which serves to benefit those (like myself) with a brief attention span, but may irritate an English instructor.  The delicate tango of first-person perspective and others speaking in code helps you sympathize with the protagonist's struggles.  I'd imagine the subject matter is the profound future of reality television, and feel the essence of being lost and manipulated for a television program's ratings is handled very accurately and tastefully.  I would suggest this novel, and further the series to just about anyone.
0316098329|5.0|I loved this book! It was very moving and I was sad to finish it. Although it has the potential to be depressing, it beautifully explores the bonds between mother and child as well as the human spirit's resilience. Best book I've read in a long time.
B005F9TQ0Q|4.0|Planet Waves falls under the category of good, not great.  Lyrically it's a step down from other Dylan albums, but the vocal melodies are a significant improvement over Self Portrait so the album lies somewhere in the middle for me.<br /><br />\\"On a Night Like This\\" is an upbeat rocker with hoedown qualities.  You can picture someone dancing in a barn thanks to the violin arrangements.  \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" has a really emotional verse melody that's almost devastating to hear the way Dylan sings it.  The slow nature of the rhythm is right on the money.  I wouldn't want it any faster.  That would ruin the magical flow.  \\"Tough Mama\\" is a WONDERFUL rocker where Dylan even escalates his vocal range.  The imaginative lyrics are most welcoming too.  A good portion of this album lacks quality lyrics but not so here.  It's a classic.  Oh, and am I imagining things or is Dylan saying \\"Hotter than a crotch?\\" near the end?<br /><br />\\"Hazel\\" is a standard ballad.  Around the 1 minute and 20 second mark, Dylan extends his range to a soaring degree and it sounds WAY off.  Not natural at all for his style.  \\"Something There Is About You\\" has a pace that moves slowly and beautifully.  It's a ballad with colorful and meaningful lyrics about Dylan finding love.  \\"Forever Young\\" is a cover of Rod Stewart's version.  NOT!  Two completely different tunes.  The aspiring lyrics about young people seeking a positive and courageous lifestyle and growing up the right way are fantastic.  I like the way the verse melody is really soft and innocent and then BAM, a loud chorus.  Now the next song, \\"Forver Young (Continued)\\", is NOT so good.  This is the theme song to Parenthood, that drama show that comes on Tuesday nights after the Biggest Loser.  I actually thought that version was a more updated version that Dylan recorded for the show, but apparently it's THIS version serving as the theme since they sound identical.  Anyway this is a more upbeat version of the previous \\"Forever Young\\" andit's worse.  MUCH worse.  I simply don't like the way Dylan sings the verse melody.  Maybe he's trying to turn it into an upbeat country song, I dunno.<br /><br />\\"Dirge\\" is the second best song on the album.  Haunting lyrics and piano work, Dylan seems especially angry and emotional on this track.  The Spanish-sounding guitar work is appropriate and awesome.  \\"You Angel You\\" is an uplifting country song with a steady, rocking beat.  Terrific.  \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" contains an unusually pretty vocal melody by Dylan's standards with a hint of blues and country thrown in the mix to make it more distinct from, not just the rest of the Planet Waves album, but the rest of everything Dylan has ever done.  It's a bit of a strange song but hey, I welcome strangeness with open arms.  \\"The Wedding Song\\" has more of those upfront and haunting vocals similar to \\"Dirge\\" and dare I say, even includes shades of Blood On the Tracks due to the thick and serious atmosphere.  I like the lyrics too.  \\"It's never been my duty to remake the world at large, nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge, 'cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend, and if there is eternity I'd love you there again\\".  Beautiful!<br /><br />Overall, it's not a classic in the same league as previous Dylan albums from the mid to late 60's, and you'll have to accept less than spectacular lyrics on everything except \\"Dirge\\", \\"Tough Mama\\" and \\"The Wedding Song\\" but it's still a pretty decent album in its own right.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I recently purchased a City Mini stroller and needed to find a solution for holding beverages and keys, etc.  I can't say enough about this product.  My old stroller had a plastic tray to hold items and because I was accustomed to using the tray I was apprehensive about purchasing the City Mini because it didn't have a tray.  This is SO much better than a tray!  I'm so glad I didn't purchase another stroller because the Mini lacked a tray (I love the City Mini stroller).  This storage solution is better than a stroller tray because your items (keys, wallets, toys, etc.) sit inside the pouch and unlike a tray, they are not in clear view.  The cup holders are fantastic because they expand to fit most beverages.  It also folds perfectly with the stroller.  This product really is an unbelievable storage solution for the price.  Don't waste your money on more expensive products; you won't be sorry if you purchase this.

I added images of the back of the DVD case to show this.  16x9 is an improvement on the 4x3 presentation of Shaun Season 1 episodes for Region 1.<br />The only 4x3 format items I've found so far are: the hit entertainment intro & menu, the LionsGate gearwheel intro, and a trailer for \\"Off the Baa!\\" The other disk 1 trailers are widescreen.  All Shaun Season 2 episodes that I've seen so far are Widescreen throughout.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|\\"My Week with  Marilyn\\" follows the behind-the-scenes social intrigues of the cast and crew of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\", Laurence Olivier's attempt at light comedy on the silver screen and Marilyn Monroe's attempt to work with serious folks, in 1956. The film's troubled production, which was apparently far more engaging than the movie itself, was recorded for posterity by Colin Clark, whose first job in the film industry was third assistant director on that film, essentially a factotum and assistant to Laurence Olivier. Clark was 23 years old at the time and enamored of Marilyn Monroe. He published a diary of his time on the set as \\"The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me\\" in 1995, followed by a memoir from which this film takes its name in 2000.<br /><br />Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) is from an old and monied English family that doesn't think much of his aspiration to a career in movies. But his persistence gets him a job with Laurence Olivier Productions, whose next film will be \\"The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me\\". Colin couldn't be happier at the prospect of meeting the glamorous, beautiful and very American Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). The production is off to a rocky start, when Marilyn is late to the first read-through, and it's clear that she is more than a little nervous, insecure, and doped-up. Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) becomes frustrated with Monroe's personal problems and her \\"method\\" approach to acting. Meanwhile, Marilyn finds Colin a down to earth person to talk to in her time of crisis.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier is intimidating and perhaps not as tolerant as he could have been of Marilyn's perpetual emotional turmoil, but I found him the most sympathetic character. He is bedeviled by Marilyn Monroe's dysfunction, which is creating a hellish working environment for him. But trying to compete with Marilyn's screen presence and sexuality leaves him in awe of her on one level.  He was a middle aged man seeking to renew and rediscover his strengths through a beautiful younger woman, but seeing himself on screen with her only made him feel old. And working with her nearly drove him mad. It's nice to see Kenneth Branagh playing a forceful character who is not always nice. I liked him in this role a lot.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is perfectly competent as Marilyn Monroe: childlike, witty, dreadfully insecure, preyed upon, but manipulative and toxic to those whose emotions she toys with. Colin Clark was too green to understand that he could get hurt trying to be Marilyn's friend -and that no one, especially not a man, could really be her friend. But he was captivated by her, and she thought him innocent enough to be trusted. Colin Clark's character, while a reasonably good lens through which to see the others, is unfortunately the film's weakness.

And working with her nearly drove him mad. It's nice to see Kenneth Branagh playing a forceful character who is not always nice. I liked him in this role a lot.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is perfectly competent as Marilyn Monroe: childlike, witty, dreadfully insecure, preyed upon, but manipulative and toxic to those whose emotions she toys with. Colin Clark was too green to understand that he could get hurt trying to be Marilyn's friend -and that no one, especially not a man, could really be her friend. But he was captivated by her, and she thought him innocent enough to be trusted.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|After a couple day it started glitching out and putting 250+ hours on shops,  animals, and my houses. it needs a update really really bad.
B004ZJZQ5G|3.0|GF says that she really liked the \\"misty\\", \\"steamy\\" setting of the movie which I can see.  Clarity of blu-ray was understandably sharp and part of the mystique and character or soft lines and a slightly hazy appearance (as seen on most DVD's in comparison to Blu-ray)was lost in the higher quality.  Good movie though...
0345803485|4.0|A well read woman may find the early content silly and trite - but hang in there - this story has guts and heart.
1469984202|5.0|I don't know much about writing, but I know what I like and this is the best series I've read since Hunger Games.  I think it'll make a terrific movie (I've got my fingers crossed!)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't worked out regularly since my youngest was born....and he's a year old. So i'm very out of shape and still have about 20 pounds to lose. I've always stuck my nose up at workout videos and maintained that the gym is 1000xs better, but even if that's true, it doesn't matter if I never go. With this DVD I have no excuses. I have 20 free minutes every single day, and I don't have to worry about taking my three kids out anywhere. I can just DO it.<br />I'm on my third day, so I can't talk about long term results, but I am definitely sore all over just from level one! It's a great workout and fast moving so it goes by quickly.<br />The only complaint I have (other than lame music) is her motivational speaking. She likes to tell me she knows I want to quit and turn off the DVD and give up. Well, I'm finding that I'm not even thinking about quitting until she brings it up and suddenly that's all I want to do! The power of suggestion, haha. I guess different things work for different people. Also, the ability to skip the beginning would be great. Don't need to see it more than once.<br /><br />Edit:  I've now done Level 1 7 times in 9 days. I've never worked out that often in my life. I haven't noticed any weight loss, but my husband can't get over the changes he sees. A more defined waste, abs, and arms area all my reward for my hard work!  Just a couple more times with level 1 and I'm ready to move up!  I've already noticed myself pushing harder since I'm finding the routine so much easier.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I highly recommend watching the concluding movie Serenity too, the twist at the end is an awesome commentary on our current social ill - medicated humanity.
0553381709|5.0|GOT is every time getting better and surprising.<br />I'm a fan and George each chapter end's makes me read without stop.

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|You can tell rosh chodesh. For gentiles it is fun but not worth paying but it seems like a good thing for Jews to get.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Found myself playing for a while. Like the upgrade part of it and free. Though little more interaction or control initially.

0756405890|5.0|This is epic fantasy at its best.  The story is about a man named Kvothe (pronounced like \\"quoth\\") and his life.  Kvothe tells his life story over a three-day period, and each book in the trilogy covers one day's worth of recounting.  Kvothe is a complex character that is at times seen as a hero and at other times as a villain.  By recounting his life, Kvothe pulls back the curtain and shows how heroes and villains are \\"created\\" and how their stories morph over time.  I don't want to divulge any of the plot; therefore, I'll just say that I stayed up until midnight one night and past 1:00 AM another night reading it.  Yes, it's that good!  I can't wait until I get the second volume.
0545405777|5.0|After seeing the movie, I had to read the book. So I ordered it from Amazon for a pretty awesome price. I read the book in a bout 2 days... I couldn't put it down, it was excellent. I really loved the movie as well, but recommend for others to read the book if they haven't already.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun and interesting good game works on kindle fire its worth getting helps pass the time lot of good games I think everyone who gets it will enjoy it<br />:)
0345803485|1.0|I could not get past about chapter 4 or 5, it was complete drivel. Quite a lot of hype for a book so poorly written! The main female character, Anastasia Steele, blushes about 1 time per page, that gets old really fast, as does her tripping. The main male character, Christian Grey, is completely one dimentional. Not for me, at all.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This is one of the best movies ive ever seen!!!!  You would be a fool not to agree with me! its sad how the apes are tested on though but the way the fight for their freedom is awesome!
B004M3GDI4|5.0|I bought this headtorch, like most I imagine, for use at work. I won't bog this review down with tech's & spec's as that has already been well covered in other reviews.<br /><br />What I will say is that although this headtorch is physically larger than most other head torches I had previously used (main light unit measures 91mm wide, 50mm deep, 48mm high approximately), it is easy to forget that you are wearing it soon after putting it on. I've not had too much oppertunity to thoroughly test all three beam patterns to their full potential, but for close up work in tight cofined spaces this torch illuminates everything with a wide generous beam on the most economical setting. This I found out first hand when working on my own cars' front suspension and steering assemblies in a gloomy unlit garage. The torch must've been on for ten consecutive hours on the two duracell batteries supplied and has not faded yet.<br /><br />Overall I would say that it's expensive, but worth it for the reliability alone.<br /><br />UPDATE: AFTER SEVEN FULL MONTHS OF USE<br /><br />I've been using this head torch now continuously for 7 months, both at work and around the home etc. , and I have found it completely indispensable. For me the three beam options tick all of the boxes I need, with an impressive battery life too. I have been using Duracell rechargeable batteries for this and bought four sets (i.e. 8 batteries in total) anticipating getting through them quite often with heavy use, this turned out not to be the case and one pack of batteries remains still sealed in their original packaging. I work in tight, dark, confined spaces every working day and I cannot fault this torch, even on it's lowest setting, and I especially love that fact that there is no shadow/dark spot within the beam of light on any of the three settings.<br /><br />Like I said in my earlier review, it is very expensive, but in my opinion it is well worth the money. If I lost it or it was stolen I would be veryannoyed due to the intially cost/expense involved, but I would definitely buy another Pixa 3 to replace it.<br /><br />One last, but important, point. I have never suffered any discomfort whilst wearing this torch. Yes it may not be the smallest/lightest on the market, but its robust and can take far more than the occaisional knock you encounter on a daily basis when working in very confined spaces.<br /><br />Absolutely 100% great buy, 10/10 Petzl.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|i love this knife big quarter inch stock nice solid . the scales are a little slippery or i should say they seem like they would be slippery but ive never actually felt it slip , anyway i put hockey tape and now it doesnt feel like that no more gotta keep on tightening up hex bolts but i dont mind that so much i just rigged up a way to carry allen wrench in the tek-lok i added to it . i had a problem with kabars cust. service while they act all nice on phone they are not very helpful about replacing the stupid chicago screws they say it was put together with nuts and bolts that are in any hardware store and maybe where they come from this is true but they are not readily available to me and anyway we are talking about a few pennies here . ive spent like 4 hundered on kabar knives this year alone , i dont feel like buying anymore kabar and its pretty much because whenever i see a kabar knife i think about the fact that kabar dont care bout their customers enough to send a couple of hard to find screws to a good payin customer
B007SYWFRM|5.0|addictive and fun a game the whole family will love and it is so cute! fun fun fun fun fun
B003G4W49C|3.0|(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br />This book is... an anomaly. I've heard it described as 'geek porn,' which is most certainly is. Ender is the worst kind of unabashed mary-sue (or gary-sue) out there. He wins every battle save for one, his enemies respect him and he respects them, everyone around him either likes him or is an evil, twisted mind. (e.g. if you don't like Ender, you're most likely evil and would rather spend your time clubbing baby seals with a plank and nail)<br /><br />However, the world that Card has built is... an interesting one, and though I don't like any of the characters (at all, none of them) I still enjoy reading the book for the world he has built and the various political and social realities his characters face. It's unfortunate that this world is wasted on such a talentless, whiny, black-and-white bunch of mary-and-gary-sues, but what can you do? Card can't characterize to save his life, but he's a great world builder.
