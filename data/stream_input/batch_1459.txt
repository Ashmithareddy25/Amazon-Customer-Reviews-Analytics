B007V5CF5K|3.0|The game has good graphics and storyline...but certain parts in the game on Kindle won't work. Stuck on the clock part and can no longer play the game since it won't work for me.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|I'm still not sure what the very beginning had to do with the end.  The girl with the teddy bear was not the winner.  There were some good fighting scenes but some people just took too long to die like a some 1930s movie where the victim is still able to stand and almost retaliate after being shot at five direct times. The subtitles are good. My favorite characters:  Mitsuko Souma (she awesome, take no prisoners kind of way) and the cute crazy guy, Kazuo Kiriyama. It's a good (somewhat mild) thriller/horror pic.

B0076NAWWA|4.0|\\"Flying Colors\\" is a fun little project. There's obviously tons of talent on display here. It very much has a \\"supergroup\\" feel to it, for better or for worse, depending on what you're looking for. You're not going to find a really cohesive album with a well-defined sound; it's kind of all over the place. \\"Blue Ocean\\" and \\"Infinite Fire\\" are prog epics that wear Neal Morse's involvement on their sleeve; \\"Shoulda Coulda Woulda\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\" are somewhere between Muse and speed metal; \\"Better Than Walking Away\\" is a straight-up power ballad; everything else falls somewhere in between. The songs are linked more by a general attitude towards music-making than by any particular theme, voice, or style.<br /><br />I would wager that the first time someone listens to this album, they'll only really like about half of it. It's just so diverse that it's tough to pin down. But eventually, the rest of the songs grow on you. \\"Kayla\\" is a spectacular piece of power-pop. \\"Love Is What I'm Waiting For\\" borrows quite unashamedly from \\"Killer Queen\\", but puts its own spin on it. \\"Better Than Walking Away\\" and \\"Fool In My Heart\\" both come off as a little bit cheesy and sentimental at first, but once you get past that, it's hard not to get caught up in their spell. Last but not least, \\"Infinite Fire\\" brings the album to a close in style.  It's a 12-minute opus that brings to mind some of the extended jamming of Kansas or Yes, but with a hypercharged, fully-harmonized chorus straight out of the late '80s. (In the best possible way, of course.)<br /><br />The instrumental performances are always top-notch and reward repeated listens. Vocally, Casey McPherson is an acquired taste and veers a little too close to a Matt Bellamy impersonation at times, but he gets the job done. Mike Portnoy gets a chance to belt out some vocals on \\"Fool In My Heart\\", and he does an admirable job. (The track as a whole, intentionally or otherwise, recalls The Beatles' \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\", more in concept than in sound; it features call-and-response singing between the drummer and a chorus of lead singers asking him if he'll be okay!) If I have one complaint about the sound of the album, it's that the vocals are a little bit overprocessed for my taste. But it's fairly appropriate for this kind of album.<br /><br />For me, the clear highlight of the album is \\"Blue Ocean\\", which gives off an incredible first impression; almost TOO good, since the very next song is virtually nothing like it. Until the final track, I was itching to hear something else along those lines, so much that I missed some of the other great stuff going on. Leave all expectations at the door and just let each song speak to you on its own merits, because there's a lot to love here.ds\\", more in concept than in sound; it features call-and-response singing between the drummer and a chorus of lead singers asking him if he'll be okay!)

B003ITZBVS|5.0|I really enjoyed Batman under the read Hood. It does have a bit of a dark story but the story does ask the question on how far can a person be plushed until they plush back. It questions the hero code of never killing the villian, which I myself find very interesting being a criminal justice major. I feel that this is a must see for all Batman and DC fans in general.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I could not put the first 2 books down, after finishing mockingjay I wish I had. I read eagerly for a week all three and felt so dissatisfied! What a let down ending in love, vengeance, family, and hope.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|I'm a big point-and-click adventure game fan, so I was naturally interested when I heard about this game.  It had awesomely positive reviews, so it seemed like a winner!  Unfortunately, I was busy with other games in my backlog so I didn't get around to playing 999 until now.  So, does it hold up to my high expectations?  Let's find out!<br /><br />Graphics (score 8/10): The art style of this game is best described as \\"anime-inspired\\" without being over the top about it.  It also seems very familiar to me, and I think I know why: it reminds me very much of the art style in the Persona games.  I don't know if they are actually related or not though...  As for the animation, there's some fully animated cutscenes here and there, but for  the most part, there's just static images paired with text.  The characters are also 2-D and they do move their eyes and mouths occasionally, but compared to a game like Phoenix Wright, it feels like there's far less movement.  It also feels like there are less static images in general compared to other games in the genre.  Limited budget perhaps?  Oh well.<br /><br />Music (score 7/10): No voice acting, but there IS some sound effects and some music.  It's pretty understated music.  There's just enough of it to be background noise, but it doesn't really stand out as much as I'd like.  That being said, I can't really say the music is bad, it's just a bit bland and unnoticeable.  That's really all I can say for this section.<br /><br />Characters (score 9/10): There are eight major characters that you spend the majority of the game with, all of them with cool codenames (everyone decides to use codenames instead of their real names when they meet in case that psycho who kidnapped them is listening in - more on that in the story section).  I'm not going to go through everyone, but you play as a young man named Junpei (who is just your average college student).  He's pretty likable and it's obvious he's supposed to represent a sort of \\"everyman\\" character for the player to relate to.  Even though the game is pretty short (it takes about 10 hours to get through one playthrough), it does a very good job of making you feel like these characters are real people through the use of very little actual knowledge about each of them.  That's a hard thing to do and I'm truly impressed.  Plus, even if you don't necessarily like all of these people, you at least empathize with them and their plight.  That, too, is rather impressive.  This would've gotten a full 10 points out of me except for one ending of the game that features a character acting like a complete psycho when it was rather out of character to do so (I'm not going to say who, but it so stunned me that I couldn't like her after that no matter what).<br /><br />Story (score 9/10): In a genre that's absolutely saturated with games themed around being a detective/investigator of some type, 999's story is a really refreshing change of pace.  Don't get me wrong, I love detective-style adventure games, but it's really nice to see something new - and it's a horror-themed game no less (the only other horror-themed adventure game I can think of on DS is Theresia)!  999's premise is that your main character, Junpei, has been kidnapped by a mysterious (aren't they always?) psychopath who's trapped him and some other random people on a sinking ship and is literally going to kill everyone if they can't solve his/her puzzles and escape.  Sounds intriguing, huh?  Well, the story is pretty good.  I do have a bit of a complaint, though.  I'm sure you've heard the old phrase \\"show, don't tell\\"?  This game has a bad habit of doing to opposite.  Rather than show you something, it just has long bits of text to exposit it.  So, for example, instead of showing Junpei's face reacting with fear, it'll just have text saying \\"Junpei reacted with fear\\".  I suppose it's related to the limited animation (see graphics section above), but I've certainly seen this sort of thing handled better elsewhere (namely in Phoenix Wright and just about every other adventure game on DS ever...).  In fact, if you are the sort of person who hates long cutscenes, then this game may have you huddled in a corner, begging for the sweet release of death...  I thought this wouldn't bother me; I mean, I played through all three games in the Xenosaga series (an RPG notorious for its long cutscenes), but it started to grate on me after awhile (I clocked one round of scenes as lasting at least 1 ½ hours!).  When you have to hit the X button or tap the screen after every few sentences, the scenes get tedious really fast.  It's especially annoying when you're fast-forwarding through stuff you've already seen before (on previous playthroughs, more on that in the gameplay section) and you just wish you could press one button and skip it entirely.  I will say one thing, though, the multiple endings ALL add some value and enjoyment to the story (once again, more on that in the gameplay section).  Well, anyway, if long cutscenes don't bother you, then I can safely say you'll enjoy the story immensely like I did since it's quite good!<br /><br />Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Games in the point-and-click adventure genre can have the best stories and most compelling gameplay ever, but usually they don't have much replay value.  I mean, if you're like me, you'll want to replay them eventually just to re-experience the story, but most of them don't have anything past that.  Well, 999 has very kindly tried to fix this problem by giving us multiple endings!  In fact, you really can't get the good ending without replaying the game.  Now before you start moaning about the tedium, the game let's you fast forward through dialogue you've already been through so it doesn't feel like such a slog fest.  I do sorely wish though that you could skip the entire scene by just pressing a button once instead of having to hold down a button to fast forward.  Oh well.  The really cool thing is that each ending (even the bad ones) is that they all add something to your knowledge about the story/characters and don't feel like a waste of time.  All I can say is that I appreciate the developer's attempt to add some replay value to this game when it's in a genre that often lacks it.  As for the actual gameplay, all the controls work well enough, and it's just what you'd expect for an adventure game; there's (long) scenes, then there's times where you wander around to explore various rooms, and there's puzzles to solve.  It's pretty standard stuff.  The puzzles themselves aren't too bad, but some of them are kinda tricky, especially if you don't understand math concepts like hexadecimals and magic squares and stuff too well (like me - sigh).  This is a very math-centered game.  Other than that, there's not much to say!<br /><br />Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this is an interesting game...  As for my expectations, I'm surprised that people gave this game such high scores.  I mean, I've seen tons of professional reviewers giving this game perfect scores when games like Ghost Trick got good, but less awesome, reviews.  If I were to be completely honest, I'd have to say that I enjoyed Ghost Trick a great deal more than this game because the whole experience (from storytelling to gameplay) just felt more polished to me.  That doesn't mean that 999 is a bad game; quite the contrary - it's got a great story and great characterizations.  I've heard that the developers are releasing a sequel to this game on the 3DS.  If they manage to balance out the length of the cutscenes vs. actual gameplay while still maintaining the same story and character standards, then I'm sure it'll turn out fantastic.  Even if they don't improve on anything, I'm still looking forward to playing that game.  I'm sure it'll still be a great experience!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I thought that this game is a good game to just sit back and play. so I would like to say thank you
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok to the author...Good job, you got published.  To those of you thinking about buying this, don't bother.  If you insist on reading it go to the library & check it out.  Don't waste your hard earned cash.<br /><br />After hearing all the hubbub about this book I decided to give it a shot.  I like romances as much as the next gal.  The book was OK.  That's the best thing I could come up with to say about it.  Not sure what all the fuss is about.  Did I hate it, no hate would require more emotion than I am willing to give this book.  Would I read it again, definitely not.<br /><br />Now if you will excuse me I need to go wash my brain out with something with a little more bite.  I'll stick with vampire romances, thanks.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Replaced the stock (and incredibly noisy) CPU fan from Intel with the Cooler Master Hyper 212.  I can't believe the noise difference; the Cooler Master is ultra quiet!  CPU temps are at least 4-5 cooler with the new unit.  The Cooler Master is absolutely gigantic.
0553801473|2.0|\\"Words are wind\\" is a phrase from all of the series books so far, and one Mr. Martin should take to heart. I thought Dickens was prolix, but at least he was paid by the word.  This book and the last are bloated to the point of absurdity, and there are now so many characters (or perhaps I should say place holders, since damn few of them have any character)that it is hard to keep everybody straight.<br />I do think it's possible to sell a series of this type without the misogyny, sadism, homophobia, and various names for genitalia that would make a 12 year old snicker at their over use.  Their absence, along with the loss of most of the \\"pithy sayings,\\" would also shorten these tomes by about a fourth.  There has been almost no discernable forward movement of the story in these last two books, and a lack of focus on the principles who are the only 3 dimensional characters.  A Prince shows up and dies, but we feel nothing because we neither know nor care about him.  I suspect Tyrion will supply Peter Dinkledge with a rich character for several seasons to come, but he, and the other characters I really care about, for the most part, I got invested in in the first book, and I see too damn little of them here.  I want to know more about Ned's surviving family, Jaime, the missing direwolf, Robert's bastard, Brienne, etc., without these bloody ciphers getting in the way.<br />George Lucas should make the big screen version--he doesn't know how to write three dimensional characters either.

B002ZG980U|3.0|My bargain rack movie for last night was the \\"Inception\\" DVD. The movie was complicated and required a lot of close attention and concentration. The story was dreaming and dreams within dreams. I ended up confused early on and it didn't get much better. The movie was interestingly done, however.<br /><br />I had trouble with the sound. It was one of these movies which relies strongly on surround sound and I don't have a surround-sound system. My sound system is stereo and it's quite good. I'd guess that most people's TV is only stereo, either as a system or as the sound of the TV set. Well, in this particular case a lot of the film's conversation was meant to come through the side speakers and it would probably be highly effective in a large theater. But I don't have side speakers and I get all my sound out of the front speakers. The engineering of this sound track was not suited with my sound system and the majority of people would probably have the same difficulty. I've run into this problem with several other DVDs but this one was particularly difficult. Another thing is that this movie has a highly-praised musical score, and I can understand. It's quite good. The problem is that the music doesn't enhance the movie. It interferes with the movie, in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" is loaded with a lot of interesting special effects including spectacular explosions which are probably meant to coincide with the dream theme. Some are very dramatic and are tied in with a major burst of sound for the sound system. Every once in a while, I'd have to decrease the sound in order not to disturb the neighbors.<br /><br />In any case, I had a lot of difficulties in watching this film. I feel that I would have to watch it over again, perhaps several times, to give it a proper evaluation. The problem is, I didn't find the film interesting enough to watch over again. I have others that I would far prefer to watch a second time. My patience on this film became somewhat exhausted. One final note. \\"Inception\\" is a 2010 movie and I'm not used to finding movies this new on the bargain rack and in such abundance. That's probably trying to say something.<br /><br />Gary Petersonted.

B002ZG99G8|3.0|Last night's bargain rack movie was \\"The Losers\\" DVD. It was one of these nonsense stories involving a death squad, the world's toughest woman, the CIA and a plethora of bad guys and took place in at least a half-dozen countries in the world. Lot's of major and some really spectacular explosions punctuated the story. I'd say the budget was probably pretty high. The action was fast and your mind was always trying to play catch-up and mine never did manage to do so. Here and there the story was actually funny, sometimes in a droll understated way. However, I would not consider it a comedy. Well, maybe it was a comedy considering the looseness of the plot and it's total improbability.<br /><br />I notice a lot of little things in movies. This group of losers flits from place to place in the world on an instant's notice. However, wherever they go everything is completely laid out for them. They always have a car, for example, and it might range anywhere from an aging Pinto to a Hummer, or there's always a jet airplane or helicopter or something fueled and ready to go for them. Secondly, no matter where they go there's always a gun and machine-gun force of bad guys blazing away and trying to do them in. Well, the bad guys are always very bad shots so they mostly end up getting killed in a variety of creative ways and The Losers continue on with the ludicrous story. Do you like a realistic, believable movie or do you prefer unmitigated nonsense that is high action and somewhat entertaining. If it's the latter, then you'll probably enjoy this film.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B005C9YZKU|5.0|This is one awesome DVD set. Blu-ray is the only way to go on this. I waited to buy this for awhile and I'm glad I did. I love the globe concept. One little draw back is the Blu-ray sleeves. I would have rather they had them in a casing BUT I can see why they did this. It makes it more eco friendly. The globe looks great on our entertainment center.  It is a Must buy for anyone who loves nature!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Bought all three books of the trilogy. Fifty Shades. Started on 1st. And OMG! Didn't think I would like them, but as I read, it was very intriguing. Little more steamy than I would normally do, but I ended up enjoying all three books. Great story line. Not for the squeemish. But definitely worth the read!

0439023521|4.0|Okay, we have seen this idea many times before in various forms.  Still, the author manages to craft a tale of young love, angst, social turmoil and inequality, and survival skills in a deadly battle witnessed by an entire country on reality TV.  Katniss is a sympathetic main character and first-person narrator that you cannot help rooting for as she tries to fend off starvation and care for her family while also being forced to kill people her own age and even younger.

0345803485|1.0|For a small introduction, know this. I don't read erotic fiction. I read horror and fantasy and sci-fi. I'm 21 years old, and have been writing since before I could speak. This review may also have spoilers if you're truly interested in reading the book.<br /><br />I'd heard nothing but horrible things about 50 Shades of Grey, and when my mom ordered it today, I warned her about it. She persevered anyway, and I decided to sit down and read what it was that she'd be reading. I normally do my best to at least give something a chance before I make an opinion about it; upon learning that 50 Shades was just Twilight fanfiction with a few names changed, I was horrified.<br /><br />I have never read Twilight myself - I tried, before the craze caught on, but I had to give it up 3 paragraphs in because it was so bad. I watched the first movie and barely made it through with my sanity. I figured this couldn't be worse.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />By the end of the second paragraph, I was regretting ever knowing how to read. The writing is sterile, bland, bad, terrible, horrible, and any amount of adjective I can think of, as it seems the author doesn't understand what a synonym is. The lack of detail is personally offensive as I've always delighted in detail, and as she goes on and on about how everyone's attractive, I'm sitting here wondering what it was that made them attractive; is it the high cheekbones, the unusual eye color, the fact their face was symmetrical and not reminiscent of the Hunchback of Notre Dame? You don't find out in the sample, that's for sure. Also, why the hatred for blondes? Did a blonde woman step on your pet ant or something? I'm surprised there weren't 'dumb blonde' jokes spat out at me.<br /><br />By the time I was halfway through the first chapter, I didn't even know the main character's name and I needed a drink. It was physically painful at this point, and I had to share it with a friend to relieve the pain a tad bit (from this point on, I'll be adding his comments as well). The pain came back tenfold when I realized that the author knew nothing and decided to make her main character as intelligent as a sack of bricks and leaves. I realized part of the way through that during the almost 3 hour drive from Vancouver, Washington, (I'm making an assumption here) to downtown Seattle, she never thought to pull up Wikipedia or Google this mystery man. So when she took it out on her 'best friend', I could only shake my head at the sheer stupidity. As my friend said, 'she just fell on the floor and said \\"damn ______ !\\" for the 4th time and I'm currently tying a noose around my throat'. Note that he actually read and enjoyed the Twilight books, as he refused to take them seriously.<br /><br />When I finished the first chapter, I was so sick of blushing and flushing and bitten lips and huffing and murmuring and muttering and blondes that I nearly cried from relief. The amount of repetition was painful, from the count a previous reviewer listed off, down to the amount of 'glass' and 'stone' written in the first chapter.<br /><br />Then there was a second chapter. I read that too, for the sole purpose to say I read what was available to me. As my friend said, 'I've seen the depths of Hell and read the devil's diary'.<br /><br />As I finish this review, he too is finishing the sample. And all he is asking me is why, and what he did for me to inflict this onto him. All I can do is laugh, and try to drink enough coffee to wipe this from my memory. I'm also half-tempted to e-mail a movie executive so I can get a $5 million movie deal (seriously?) and chronicle this painful ordeal, and have that money I make pay for much-needed therapy. I have written roleplay profiles better than this; does that mean I can get them published in a book too?<br /><br />There was one thing that impressed me about this book sample, however. The main character is flushing, blushing, tripping, biting her lip and going 'crap' all over, and then BAM! She comes out with a word like autocratic. I wasn't expecting that one, so bravo.

B00715SUI6|2.0|Paranormal Activity 3 is neither scary nor believable. First off, the story makes no sense. Is it a ghost, a demon or a coven? Get it straight. Second, who would videotape themselves watching a videotape? Strange behavior. Next, why would the ghost or the people allow recording. Finally, videotape was not widescreen and had poor low-light capability (this movie is dim but we can see what's going on).<br /><br />The kitchen scene is the only interesting scene in the entire movie.<br /><br />The best movie of this genre is still Blair Witch Project. Everything about that movie was somewhat believable.<br /><br />[DW]

We're still dwelling on the neighbors, how he loves his wife, and how uninteresting the morning breakfast conversation is at this point.  I do so much appreciate Amazon's return policy. Good luck to those of you that can bear with this boring book.

It was great to still hear Jonathan Frid's voice in the narration!  Barnabas coming back into 1972 was surprising how he had to get used to the changes.  It made us laugh and still remember the old days with what Barnabas went through when we watched it in the earlier days.<br />After watching it as a young girl and purchasing the whole set (receiving it as a Christmas gift) and getting my husband into it, we both were very happy with the movie.  We knew how the show ended excellently.  The movie continued where it left off, adding some laughter but again an excellent ending.

The only thing I don't like is that all the discs are basically half on one side, half on the other and there is nothing on between each disc to prevent scratching. But it is nothing that can't be fixed. Other then that this was a great buy.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|This is a mindless but fun shoot 'em type of revenge thriller where the action is just non-stop once it gets going. Jeffrey Dean Morgan leads a hapless group of elite mercenaries who were betrayed by their boss, and now they're out for some payback. I admired Morgan's work in Watchmen where he played The Comedian and here he does a fine job as the group's leader. Zoe Soldana plays the tough female lead who many will remember from Avatar. I wasn't familiar with most of the other actors but they were all good. The script is decent, the acting good, and the action scenes are first rate. Overall a good choice for some mindless but fun entertainment on a lazy weekend night.
0345803507|1.0|I think this series got worse as it went along. By the end of this book, it felt very dragged out and tired. I can enjoy a trashy novel as much as the next girl (and I mean that in the best of ways), but when I got to the end of the trilogy, I just kept wanting it to be more than what it was. I wanted it to be better written, more thoughtful, more fun and, well, more interesting. So, in my opinion, here are 50 ways I wish this series were more interesting than what it was. (Spoilers abound. List was compiled with a fellow reader.)<br /><br />1. Christian's secret is that he tortured and killed his mother's pimp.<br />2. The charity he's been donating to is actually a front for selling illegal arms in guerrilla warfare. I can't decide if its better if he knows about it or finds out about it later.<br />3. Ana is actually kind of a ho and teaches Christian a few things<br />4. Ana gave a kid up for adoption before she met Christian<br />5. Christian is running a giant ponzi scheme<br />6. Christian is a pimp for expensive call girls that used to be his subs<br />7. Taylor, Christian's live-in head of security, is secretly Christian's biological father<br />10. Christian is an international gangster--that's why he's so rich<br />11. Christian opens a thesaurus and uses words for his mother that aren't \\"crack whore\\"<br />12. Book is written from the perspective of Ana on the reality show \\"real girlfriends of Seattle\\"<br />13. Therapist Dr. Flynn falls in love with Ana and messes with Christians head in anger/jealousy<br />14. Taylor, the male head of the security team, and Christian had a secret illicit affair<br />15. Ana becomes a businesswoman and rivals Christian at work<br />16. I would also like to acknowledge that to receive an email on Ana's blackberry, it would have to be sent to her personal email address, and for her to receive an email on her work computer, it would have to be sent to her work email address. These are different things. Also, does no one elseever send Ana an email?<br />17. Ana finds Viagra in his apartment<br />18. Someone at least once does something embarrassing during sex, i.e. falling off the bed, can't get bra unhooked, etc.<br />19. They lived in a world where hangovers exist<br />20. They stopped arguing about how they don't deserve each other<br />21. Christian makes $100,000 an hour? hahahahaha, please<br />22. Ana actually had a computer since, you know, she's an A student and lives in the 21st century and has a job<br />23. The sex scenes were better. Yeah, I said it.<br />24. Ana was into dominating and Christian was not<br />25. Darfur seems to be thrown around a lot without anyone actually seeming to know why, so maybe we could pick a less trendy cause for Christian?<br />26. Christian has an older sister that surfaces<br />27. There is a hostile takeover of Grey's company<br />28. Christian accidentally killed a submissive<br />29. Christian is a secret serial killer of pimps<br />30. Ana is already using birth control<br />31. Ana is a lesbian<br />32. Ana has a life-threatening disease that one of Christian's research teams can cure...but she's not telling<br />33. Ana likes being a submissive and later wants her own sub<br />34. Christian is gay<br />35. Christian's real dad shows up and wants money<br />36. Christian's real dad shows up and is also very rich<br />37. Christian's real dad shows up and tries to kill Christan because he doesn't want any other heirs around<br />38. Call the book 50 shades of red..amp up the sadism<br />39. Christian's company sells the sex products and he tests them<br />40. Jose begins to stalk gray to do away with him<br />41. Kate feels she deserved Christian and goes after him<br />42. Someone starts blackmailing Christian...and it's ?...Take your pick<br />43. Christian's mom is still alive and is looking for him<br />44. Christian finds out he already has a kid he didn't know about<br />45. Ana reads modern fiction/science fiction/anything other than romantic English literature<br />46. Ana likes make-up and shopping and realizes this does not make her any less smart<br />47. Someone at his work files a suit because he only hires attractive blonde women<br />48. Same story, half the length<br />49. Christian is ugly, Ana falls for him anyway<br />50. Everyone stopped saying the phrase \\"mighty fine\\" forever

0345803485|2.0|So I do this thing, where if everyone starts reading something, I want to read it to. I was an early Harry Potter adopter, but since then hopping on the bandwagon has led me to things like the Hunger Games, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Twilight. (I'm not saying all of these things have been good.) I just can't help it. I want to join the conversation and see what the fuss is about, and I want to be able to knowledgeably explain through experience why Hermione is a better role model than Bella Swan. (There are lots of reasons why).<br /><br />I am also interested in how women are portrayed in the popular novels and I'm thankful that there are badasses like Katniss and Lisbeth to balance out the insecure boy-crazy Bellas of the young adult literary world.<br /><br />So when I started 50 Shades of Grey, I fully expected to hate it and the characters. I learned that it began as fan-fiction story based on Bella and Edward of Twilight. But then once it grew, they changed a few details, expanded on the story and made it what it is...which seems to be a sexy harlequin novel for the ladies who lunch.<br /><br />So I expected the terrible character traits from Twilight + sex. But by the end of the book, I actually liked Ana, the main character who falls for a sexy billionaire. SPOILER ALERT--there are spoilers in the following lists.<br /><br />Reasons she is better than Bella:<br /><br />She has a job<br />Her mother says that a man she dates should be worthy of her, and she agrees and takes this to heart<br />She is independent. For real, she has an after school job, gets an after college job, does her homework, packs her house, and gets to where she needs to go all on her own.<br />She says no to the hot billionaire trying to swoon her--she doesn't give him everything he asks for and she takes time to think about what she wants to do<br />She decides she wants love, and when Hot Billionaire can't give it to her, she leaves (ok, I'm fully aware that in the next few books I'm sure they won't be able to stay away from each other and they'll get back together. But let me have this one time where she decides she doesn't have to stay in a relationship that won't give her what she needs)<br />For the record, this only applies to Ana. I find Hot Billionare to pretty much embody all the terrible things Edward also embodies: crazy, controlling, controlling, and controlling. Though I guess Hot Billionaire does listen to Ana and respects when she says no, where Edward does not. So, plus one very small point for HB.<br /><br />Other surprising things I am ok with in this book:<br /><br />They encourage open and honest communication, even (maybe especially) about sex. They talk about what they like and don't like, what they are comfortable with and birth control and STD tests. Granted, this is on the premise of forming an S&M relationship, but they apply these open and honest discussions in every part of their relationship (and the S&M is overplayed and doesn't really get that weird.)<br />Ok, this might be the end of that list. But really, among all the expected terribleness, I was very surprised to find that there was things that young women could take out of this book besides bad writing and sexy sex with a fantasy man.
B0055SWM08|3.0|This game is a fun time killer. Addictive while playing it, but not on my mind all the time to make me dig in my phone to find it all the time.
0345803485|1.0|Dismal writing and a repetitive and eventually boring plot meant I cannot read the next two books in the series, even though, admittedly I was left a little curious to know what might happen in the second book. This book needed way more plot to elevate it and hold my interest. And while the sex was titillating, by the time I'd read their second encounter I was bored and thinking surely this isn't it from here on in? But it was it. Sorry. I just don't get the hype, beyond natural curiosity about the strangely dark subject matter. Not enough to entertain me.

B005LAIHKY|3.0|Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp team up again for yet another version of their quirkiness.  OK, we get it.  While I never watched the \\"Dark Shadows\\" soap opera, I understand it was not supposed to be humorous.  So when transplanted to the screen should it have been more serious?  Eh, maybe not.  But at least make up your mind.<br /><br />The movie begins with something similar to Coppala's version of \\"Dracula\\" (1992) where Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed by a witch around 1776 for spurning her love for another.  He becomes a vampire but is soon captured and buried in a silver chained coffin.  Nearly 200 years later the coffin is uncovered at a construction site and Barnabas is set free.  He finds his old homestead is in a poor state and that his fishing enterprise has floundered and replaced by a witchy descendent of Angelique (Eva Green).  Spoiler alert:  The witch is the same person, but has aged well.<br /><br />Barnabas confides in the current head of the household Elizabeth (a still stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) of his secret but doesn't \\"come out\\" to the others until later.  The house is filled with off kilter children (Chloe Moretz and Gulliver McGrath) and even weirder adult staffers (Jackie Earle Haley, Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Shirley).  Then of course there is the beautiful Bella Heathcote as Victoria, the reincarnation of Barnabas original love from 1776 who was offed by an Angelique spell.<br /><br />The film is full of some excellent photography and well used CGI but it continually bogs down.  Full of fits and starts, it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is supposed to be.  I did think the scene where Barnabas can't resist the amorous advances of Angelique to be pretty good.  And we do learn with certainty that when a vampire has sex, bedrooms are destroyed (see \\"True Blood\\" and \\"Twilight: Breaking Dawn\\" for further proof).  Although the ending includes an opening for a sequel, I wouldn't bet on it.

They've included more orchestral elements, but still keep to their folk-metal style. My personal favorite tracks are \\"Hunting Pirates\\" and the title track, \\"Stand Up and Fight\\". The instrumental and choral elements really add to the music, and makes it, dare I say, very epic. Fans of folk/melodic and symphonic metal should definitely check this album out!

B0065RIJ3W|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />This book gives a fantastic explanation of what you'll need to set up your own aquaponics system, including the benefits and drawbacks of various materials, size ratios, etc.  The information is comprehensive and extremely useful - everything from what size tanks one should use to the pros and cons of using lava rocks, gravel, etc. as a medium, to what you can grow to feed the fish.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />There weren't any major drawbacks to the book, but it seemed like the first third of it was a discussion of the environmental and food sustainability issues facing the world.  While this is related to aquaponics, this section was old and common sense information that should have taken a couple paragraphs, not 33% of the book.  Regardless, the other 67% was invaluable.

1612680011|2.0|As a recent grad just learning about personal finance, I found \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" inspiring. It definitely gave me a new perspective on wealth and income. After reading this book I pursued other books about money and investments, a subject that has never interested me before. I overcame my fear of the stock market and invested in a mutual fund and some individual stocks that I think are going to perform well. By giving me a different way to think about wealth, it's possible that this book could (indirectly) end up making me some money.<br /><br />However, I don't believe this book is worth buying. The important lessons can be summed up in a few common sense sentences or motivational phrases, the most valuable of which is \\"the rich buy assets, the poor buy liabilities\\"--hardly an insight worth $7.99.<br /><br />Because Kiyosaki has some motivational points, an accessible writing style and a bestselling book, it's easy to get suckered in to the entire show--the tapes and seminars, the kids' books, the \\"free\\" classes, the board game. But these things are expenses, not assets or investments. You'd be better off starting an IRA and buying some index funds than spending more than a few dollars on motivational books or \\"programs.\\"<br /><br />If you are a beginner looking for some books on smart investing (or buying a present for someone who is), try [[ASIN:0060555661 The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition)]], which Warren Buffet called \\"by far the best book on investing ever written.\\" Or check out [[ASIN:0470102101 The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns (Little Books. Big Profits)]]. These are books written by successful investors, not introductions to a \\"program\\" or \\"secret\\" will somehow make you rich.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|The story line is 99.9% \\"romantic tension.\\"  Silly me; I was expecting another Vampire movie. In summary: a gal who can't make up her mind (no surprise, what does one really know about love at 18) and the two guys who vie for her love but compromise to keep her safe together.  This is probably a wonderful story line for female tweens (12-14 yrs) but that's about the extent of its' appeal. It never got off this one-dimensional storyline that had a strictly female perspective (vacillation, and then more vacillation, anyone?).  The best line in the movie:  \\"Doesn't that guy own a shirt?\\".  That Edward voiced that thought aloud to his gal speaks to the new sensitive male that is what women are looking for these days - guys who wear their heart on their sleeves and all that.  A shirtless Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is a great piece of eye candy, that's for sure!  But not enough to overcome the insurmountable fact that this movie tells no story remotely interesting to anyone but very young, starry-eyed females.  The jury is in:  I find this movie guilty of not being entertaining!

B0019NB9A2|5.0|Space age interior design circa 1956 was the highlight of this for me, along with Robbie the Robot and the very young and nubile Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen and Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius.<br /><br />The background space age sci-fi sound effects were generously sprinkled throughout to highlight the futuristic drama.<br /><br />Dr. Morbius had the perfect planet of pleasure all to himself with his gorgeous daughter until his subconcious came to life in monster form and almost broke through his barracaded ultra modern interior designed Jetson's style house.<br />The green sky of the pleasure planet matched the avacado green walls, and the rust red soil matched the carpet of his home.  Metal sculpture and sophisticated mid century modern sofas and chairs in metalic mauve fabric brought home the futuristic concept of this amazingly well done movie. Sputnik wall sconces provided lighting.  Whoever the interior designer on planet Altair-IV is, she/he does space age modern design very well.<br /><br />In fact, four themes from the mid century are apparently the inspiration for this movie:<br />1. space exploration<br />2. the resulting concept of ultra modern space age design in furnishing and archetecture<br />3. robots<br />4. Sigmund Freud's concept of the id.<br /><br />Also we see the concept of saucer shaped flying disks represented by the spaceship which can go faster than the speed of light, a physics concept currently believed to be impossible and yet still hoped for in the future as a way to travel to distant galaxies.<br /><br />This movie displays everything we were thinking about in the nineteen fifties as science fiction was just starting to come into reality with the excitement of Sputnik and UFO's orbiting overhead in the night sky and reflected in our new ultra modern design of our homes.  If only they could have inluded a few of the cars with big tail fins of the era, meant to look like rocketships, it would have been complete.<br /><br />Included was the prescient and as of then unheard of idea of young women in micro-miniskirts and bare feet.<br /><br />This movie is a time capsule of our new concepts of the universe circa 1956.  It was a time of great excitement about what might lie out there in space.  The charm of this era was captured gloriously in this amazing movie.the prescient and as of then unheard of idea of young women in micro-miniskirts and bare feet.<br /><br />This movie is a time capsule of our new concepts of the universe circa 1956.

B007549W62|4.0|Nuclear warheads rain down in the city and a group of survivors take refuge in the bunker-like basement of their building. But as the days wear on, food becomes short, tensions build and the survivors find out that maybe the luckiest people died in the blast. Sure, this kind of movie has been done before on more than one occasion, but I dig the director and frankly, it just looked really good. And it was. The movie is incredibly visceral, dark, bloody, sadistic, everything you would expect to see if this were a real life scenario. Now, there was something that happened early on that frankly didn't quite work for me, it just seemed really out of place. But then it turned out that it was the only way it could make the fantastic ending work. So I'm a bit torn there. Also, there was the acting, which seemed really overdone at first but then really started to find its place. It's almost as if the characters were putting on facades when they first came together, but then spend enough time together and the real character comes out. This is just a fantastic movie and I absolutely loved it.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This is an excellent action adventure film. First, I liked the decision to use an older Indiana Jones and stick with Harrison Ford with a story that takes place during the Cold War while Ike was President. I thought the story was well written and a strong cast was assembled. While I certainly missed Sean Conner and Denholm Elliot, this story takes place nearly twenty years later and the enemy has changed from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. The film acknowledges their passing and the arrival of a new age which constantly keeps our head spinning with reasons for hope and despair. The FBI even suspects the loyalty of Indiana Jones to the amazement of his colleagues. Yet to the amazement of Jones he is betrayed by an old wartime friend! How does the Dean put it? We seem to be entering a period of life where more is taken from us than given to us.<br /><br />The film truly seems rather downbeat at the railroad station until the arrival of Mutt on his bike with a plea for help from an old friend. Rather than remaining dejected Jones listens to the young man, who he later learns is his son, about the trouble that another old friend, Oxley, has gotten his mother who he later learns is a past lover, Marien Ravenwood from the first film. Indiana Jones isn't the beaten man filled with despair at the railroad station but somebody with hope for tomorrow at the end of the film.<br /><br />Even if the heroine role had been saved for Karen Allen, Cate Blanchett was superb as Dr.Irina Spalko. She made the show run with her pursuit of the Crystal Skull from the opening scene to the final one at the temple. Ray Winstone,the wartime buddy, who betrays Jones, puts in a fine job as Mack. She also receives some fine support from Igor Jijikine as Colonel Antonin Dovchenko. Communist ideology would not permit the pursuit of any religious artifact but evidence of an ET might prove attractive and remember the space race was just beginning.<br /><br />Karen Allen played Marien Ravenwood and starred in the first film with a romantic final scene between Jones and herself. Whatever happened to it? When she makes her first appearance Jones is shocked when he learns Mutt is her son. Earlier in the film he only introduced himself and his mother as friends of Dr. Oxley, played by John Hurt  Another key supporting actor was Shia LaBeouf who played Mutt. Marien only told Jones that he was the father when it appeared that they were going to die.<br /><br />The Crystal Skull is first and foremost an adventure but it also becomes an opportunity for reconciliation between Jones and his past for a brighter future. Like Jones in The Last Crusade, Mutt gets an opportunity to work with his father and learn all about him. Marien remembers the man she fell in love with. He renews a friendship with Oxley (John Hurt)and returns to college in a new position as an Associate Dean and married to Marien Ravenwood.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about The Crystal Skull was the consistent pace of the story. It never stalls. So time quickly passes. The first and second films stalled on occasion, the third film slowly started but quickly finished. The only mediocre film was The Temple of Doom. The two best films were The Last Crusade and The Crystal Skull.starred in the first film with a romantic final scene between Jones and herself. Whatever happened to it?

B001V5CIFI|4.0|Good movie for all.  Good acting by young and old actors.  Adults will like premise and dislike the noise level.  Kids will enjoy the hijinks by kids and hopefully not copy at home.  Overall,  fun movie with no lack of action.
0439023491|3.0|The second book of the Hunger Games Trilogy does not move at the same exciting pace of the first book. There is a lot of recapping and flashback. Isn't it fair for an author of a trilogy to assume that readers have read the fist book already?<br /><br />What I like most about Catching Fire are the many situations that require problem-solving by the main characters. Their thought processes, interactions and moral dilemmas are very realistic. What I like least is the mixture of science fiction and magic: the credibly possible with the clearly fantastic. It makes one swing from fully engaged with believable human situations to skeptical withdrawl with \\"I don't believe that\\" swimming in the mind.<br /><br />There are surprising plot twists and clever resolutions that make this an interesting story. Although I found myself wanting the story to move along faster, what this book actually does is set the reader up for the faster-paced and more action-oriented third book of the trilogy.<br /><br />This book gets three stars. Not as engaging, fast-paced and dramatic as The Hunger Games, but a good read nonetheless.

You will be on the edge of your seat right to the very end.  And what movie that has Liam Neeson isn't good.  He is a true Movie Star.  A great action hero and a mans man.  Those that tell you this is not a good movie or just a so-so movie simply didn't like the ending.  Because it makes you think.  And those who gave this a bad review simply don't like thinking.

B005FISC52|5.0|Unlike most reviewers, I didn't grow up with OTH...I came to the show about 2 months ago via SoapNet, which aired 3 shows a day.  Then, when I was hooked on the fabulous stories, the acting, and the characters, SoapNet went off the air.  I went into OTH obsession mode, and began watching 4-6 episodes a day after buying the last 3 seasons on Amazon Video on Demand.  I watched them all on my tiny Kindle Fire.  The final season was wonderful and wrapped everything up in a neat little package.  I did wish that Lucas and Peyton made more appearances, but it was still pretty amazing.  OTH was a great little show-now I know what I was missing out on all of those years when others were watching!

There's some thought that has to be put into each puzzle, but nothing seems to be so hard that you can't advance a level or two during a few minutes' down time at work or waiting on the bus, &c.  Good graphics and smooth performance make a worthy addition to any casual gamer's arsenal.

0785156593|4.0|Having seen the Avengers movie, I wondered who that odd looking fellow with the menacing grin was in the post-credits scene and did some googling when I got back home. His name is Thanos and the info I read pointed toward a book that does the character the best justice - &#34;The Infinity Gauntlet&#34; - and luckily my local library had a copy so I grabbed it and sat down this afternoon to read it.<br /><br />While the book is 20 years old at this point, I loved it. But what's it about? It's about Thanos and his love for Mistress Death (yup Death is a chick but readers of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series already knew this), he's trying to win her over and he decides to do this by getting unlimited power via something called the Infinity Gauntlet and destroying the universe. Really, this is the weirdest romance story you'll ever read.<br /><br />And that's the premise of the book. Thanos must be stopped but how do you stop a being with infinite power, who is in essence God? The Marvel superheroes decide to give it a go and things inevitably don't work, so a strange entity called Adam Warlock gathers together the ultimate beings of the universe in a final battle to end all battles. The results are pretty impressive.<br /><br />The scale is gargantuan with a being called Eternity weighing into the fight, along with other beings called Chronos, Master Chaos and even manifestations of Love and Hate. Things get very abstract when planets become weapons to be hurled at Thanos and something called the Soul Realm comes into play. I won't spoil how it ends but it's all pretty epic and sensational.<br /><br />Jim Starlin writes a vast and fascinating story about love and power amidst new gods. He keeps the action up and the mysticism and cosmic weirdness going throughout while still maintaining a sense of plot, character, and story so the reader is never fully lost in what's happening. George Perez's artwork, while clearly dated, serves the story perfectly and does a fine job of depicting a near impossible task of unimaginable proportions.<br /><br />I wonder how Thanos' introduction in the Avengers movie sequel will affect the tone of the flick - if Whedon and co. go down this path, the next movie is going to be supremely weird and cosmic really quickly, a huge leap from where the Marvel movies have been so far. But maybe they won't pick up the &#34;Infinity Gauntlet&#34; storyline and go another direction. Meanwhile, any comics readers who are looking for a mind-bending read in the Marvel Universe would do well to pick up this book - even if the movies won't go there, the comics will and it's definitely worth the trip.epicting a near impossible task of unimaginable proportions.<br /><br />I wonder how Thanos' introduction in the Avengers movie sequel will affect the tone of the flick - if Whedon and co. go down this path, the next movie is going to be supremely weird and cosmic really quickly, a huge leap from where the Marvel movies have been so far.

B004FOA84A|5.0|My 9 year-old and I had a fun time with this game. It's very short, but a fun little adventure with straightforward, albeit bizarre, puzzles.<br /><br />I also got the other Manor title, and it's awful.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This is a very awesome game. The story is interesting and the gameplay is deceptively simple, and it gets harder as you go. I played it online, too. Worth 99 cents.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun similar to paradise island but more interactive you do have to be aware that you can spend real money.  great graphics and kid friendly for My 8 and 10 year old.

0345803485|2.0|Finally finished this book and I'm experiencing Fifty Shades of Disappointment. Thank goodness I have too much self-confidence and common sense to ever allow a man to hurt me in order to keep him. Doesn't matter how handsome or rich he may be. Terrible writing, editing and plot aside, some scenes are just glamorised abuse and I feel sorry for the women who may try to apply any of the patterns in this book to their own lives. If anything it's just an example of a very unhealthy relationship and I have no interest in suffering through more of it in books 2 and 3.<br /><br />I waited to get it from my local library and I'm happy I did. Save yourself the money and borrow the first one because you may hate it or love it as you can see from the reviews. I personally don't see what the big deal is. I've read much better erotica so maybe the people who love this book have never been exposed to erotica before?
B000005Z0E|5.0|this is a classic album. This is 2pacs first album. it talks about rasism, police brutality and teen pegnancy, no gansta rap. this is one of pacs greatest albums!!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I picked up this book hoping it would tide me over for a week until the second book in a series I was waiting for came out. Read it in 2 days tho...couldn't put it down! A must read!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked up these novels to see what all the hoohah was about. From the way people talked about these stories, I expected serious erotica, but I have come to the conclusion that the people raving about it and claiming that were simply just as naive as Anastasia.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers in that the whole story could have been written as one book. Erotica it is not...it is really just the same sex scene written over and over.  That being said...the love story that occurs and blossoms through the trilogy is pretty good.  I found myself reading on for that purpose.  So, if you are looking for a romance novel with the normal trials and tribulations, this is your series.  BUT, if you are looking for erotica...you are looking in the wrong place.  I don't agree that it was badly written, but just simply categorized wrong.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app ia addictive it may shut down and close but you have to either buy the other one or get the free one again for anyone it isn't working on right now

B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Not sure how i missed this one at the theaters but was pleasantly surprised by the action and fun this movie was. usually dont like Mark Wahlberg's acting because it seems like he's always whining in his movies, but this one is pretty good, and free for amazon prime users. If it's not free for you I would still pay the money to watch this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the games are amazing but seruisly face book! these games are killing me at the same time. its stupid! but other than that the game yet again is amazing. deserves 5 stars.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|As always......Johnny is awesome & verrry funny....I hope Rowan has not really retired from acting....It would be a big loss to fans......
0307352145|5.0|This book is very well written and researched by Susan Cain.  It flows well and has a lot of thought provoking material in it.<br />I read the book and then gave it to my college-aged daughter to read.  Extroverts can learn a lot from this book too, because<br />Susan Cain points to research that differentiates between introverts and extroverts.  I highly recommend it for introverts who<br />want to know how to better take care of themselves and to learn how important introverts are in the history of our country.<br />Parents, teachers and business owners can also learn a lot from this book.  Introverts are the thinkers, the imaginers, the<br />problem finders, the depth seekers and more.  They are a treasure to our world.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun and cool for a free game. many levels gets easier after. a few rounds.  the control is confusing. at first.
0061969656|3.0|Uhtred is beginning to age, but he gamely continues bashing his way through the Dark Ages in this continuation of the chronicle of Alfred the Great and his descendants.  The battle for the English throne follows the death of Alfred, along with the incessant raids of the Danes, who already control much of the country.  As in the other novels in this series, the battle scenes blur together in a frenzy of hacking, slashing, screaming, and blood.<br /><br />Much of this book is enjoyable reading, as always, but for me the series is getting a bit tired.  For heaven's sake, Mr. Cornwell, let Uhtred have the family seat back already!  Perhaps the author will wrap up the series, and the next installment will be the last.  I, for one, think it's time.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This app is pretty good but there are only some very simple timer options. You cannot specify your own game length or give one side more time than the other. Also, the computer moves very quickly each turn so it is impossible to play blitz against it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good app. a lot like Mario bros. controls are complex, but easy enough to figure out. pinecone throwing is a nice touch.
B001LM1456|5.0|Just finished watching this and I have to say they did an AWESOME job of making this movie!!  In most action films during the action the viewer gets blur and poor views of the action where you know mayhem is going on but you can't make it out and wish for a better camera shot and sometimes slow motion so you don't miss the action.  In this film they did a really good job of letting you see the action.  More importantly, the story was well done, the casting was perfect and the acting was top notch all around.  VERY WELL DONE!!<br /><br />If you're a nit-picker over thinker type, there are two tiny little story (flaws??)... what happened to Mr Blue after he got exposed (was another monster created?), and how could the military possibly have taken care of the bad guy after Hulk beat him down ('cause you know he has the amazing ability to recover and the military didn't seem to have a way to make a dent in him much less hold him)<br /><br />But BOTTOM LINE:  If you're into this type of movie, you will LOVE this one!!
1455508977|5.0|This is the first book by Nicholas Sparks that I've read. I read the book then watched the movie. The book is better. There is amazing tension running through the whole story. Tension between characters and within themselves. There were a couple times when I threw the book and simultaneously exclaimed \\"No!\\" I'm a very interactive reader. Then I picked it up and dove right back in. I am not an avid reader but it is an easy read and I was finished in two days.

B005LAIGTG|5.0|There are sappy romance films galore being released to theaters these days that have the most unbelievable stories behind them. So the biggest surprise this week is a romance that is unbelievable and yet based on reality. Not only that but the movie is touching, romantic and draws you in. That movie is THE VOW.<br /><br />Channing Tatum and Rachael McAdams play Leo and Paige, a young couple deeply in love on their way home from a night out in winter. Stopped at a stop sign, their car is rear ended by a sliding snow plow, sending Paige through the window to suffer severe brain damage. Kept in a coma to decrease the severity of her injury when she wakes she has no recollection of the accident but worse still no idea who Leo is. It's as if the last 5 years of her life have disappeared.<br /><br />Hoping that time heals all wounds, Leo stays with her even though she recoils from him, a complete stranger in her mind. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) show and try to encourage her to leave the hospital and go with them. Leo convinces her that the best hope she has of recovering her memory is to return to the life they had. She agrees for now with the idea that should things not work out she'll return to her parent's home.<br /><br />Its slow going as the couple Leo tries to convince the woman he desperately loves that she loves him in return. The Paige from before she and Leo met is a completely different person from who he thought he knew. For some reason she left her home and friends to come to the city, but we never know why. The couple goes back and forth, trying to bring back their life together but eventually Paige's parents convince her to come home.<br /><br />Helping her sister plan her wedding and still trying to find herself, Paige meets up with her ex-fianc&eacute; (Scott Speedman). Her parents try to convince her that she still wants to go to law school even though she was an artist while with Leo. An old friend is shunned but others are brought back into the fold. And as Leo watches, hoping against all odds to reunite with this woman, she slowly begins to distance herself from him for her old self.<br /><br />This romance involves not two young lovers meeting for the first time but two lovers who met and fell in love only to lose all memory of that. The only hope is for them to once more come together replacing those old memories with new ones. And the suspense of the film lies in that idea, of whether or not they can come together once more of will Paige slide back into the past that is all she remembers now. And what about that terrible secret that no one seems to want to talk about that forced her out so long ago?<br /><br />The movie is supposed to be based on an actual couple that went through this trauma and after watching the film many will want to make a point of reading the book based on their life to find out just what is and isn't a part of their story. In the meantime this movie offers a completely entertaining night that won't bore you and actually won't make you break down and cry either, no matter how it sounds. This is a movie where you won't find yourself checking the clock to see just how much is left. It moves along at a steady pace and draws you into the story in steps.<br /><br />The acting is amazing. Never once did I find myself wondering if I was watching actors or real people and that says something. The gift of a true actor is to make you believe they are the people they are portraying. McAdams and Tatum both do that to great effect here.  With the roles he chose early on many would have thought Tatum was nothing more than a muscle bound action star but he displays a depth of emotion here that is necessary for this story to be taken seriously. McAdams shows the frustration and fear in the character of Paige that makes her part of the story come alive as well.<br /><br />Toss aside trying to place this film in the category of chick flick. It's a truly entertaining film from start to finish that will leave you waiting to find out if they get back together or not. This is a movie not only worth renting but worth adding to your collection as well.at will leave you waiting to find out if they get back together or not. This is a movie not only worth renting but worth adding to your collection as well.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|For a film called THE IRON LADY this movie was felt more like it was formed from Reynold's wrap. But what else would you expect in a movie made about a Conservative woman by a group of Liberal die hards? Its difficult not to bring politics into a film of this nature since the centerpiece is a politician. But when all that's offered is a one sided description how can you not?<br /><br />For those who are confused while watching a film that jumps back and forth in time then stop reading and forget this movie. It does that from start to finish and not very well. The object of the movie, the Iron Lady in question, is ex-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, portrayed here by Meryl Streep in an Oscar winning performance. Just another example of why the Oscars mean so little these days.<br /><br />The film opens with Thatcher in her later years post PM status and after the death of her beloved husband Dennis (Jim Broadbent). At this time Thatcher was dealing with the impending onset of Alzheimer's as well as the loss of the man she so desperately cared for. We watch as she attempts to force herself to part with those things left behind, clothes and the like. And while she does, so various items and things around her home lead her to remember her past.<br /><br />We get glimpses of young Margaret as she works in her father's store while the other girls walk past. We she her listening and being influenced by her father's speeches to the locals touting the value of a solid business front not willing to cower to the Nazis as they attempt to bomb the country and force the people into hiding. These are the ideas that formed the basis for her beliefs but they are given short time here.<br /><br />Flash forward as Margaret deals with her daughter or perhaps the other way round. We see her getting ready for a dinner with friends where her opinions are asked but she seems buried in the past and her guests seem more embarrassed than pleased to hear her views. Her daughter acts the same.<br /><br />Back in time we see how Margaret meets Dennis but not how they fell in love. Margaret decides to take on the establishment and become a female member of Parliament. Her struggles in the face of chauvinism can be seen here with a touch of the problems she faced but more in focus as to the differences in clothing choices, a bright blue dress among a sea of black suits.  Then back to her slow slide into dementia.<br /><br />The important historic moments in Thatcher's life are touched on but very lightly. Incidents like the Falkland War and the miner's strike feel like they are mentioned without any depth to them. Other items like the Iran hostage situation are ignored completely. With the amount of story involved in Thatcher's life I was left wondering why the film makers here decided that her illness seemed the most interesting part of her life instead of those more interesting historical moments. Then again when thinking about Hollywood's depiction of Conservative figures I recalled the attempt to make Ronald Reagan look senile and mentally ill as well. The friendship between Reagan and Thatcher is barely touched on in this film.<br /><br />Streep won the Oscar for best actress for her performance here. I am at a loss as to understand why with the exception of the fact that she is Hollywood royalty and is nominated for anything she does these days. I saw little acting here and more impersonation. If that's all it takes to win an Oscar then Rich Little should have had an entire shelf lined with the trophies. I will admit that I've never been a Streep fan up front but this movie did little to change my mind.<br /><br />It would be nice if folks in Hollywood would take a historical topic and present the facts untarnished by their own viewpoints when making the film. I have little doubt that there were bad things about Thatcher but there were good as well. A movie that would choose to present both sides and let the viewer decide would have been interesting. This movie did little but make you wonder how she stayed PM for 11 years. Then again the movie also made you wonder about her sanity the longer you watched.<br /><br />To capture an entire life in 105 minutes is difficult at best. To present it accurately and fairly even more so. Some may watch this film and think they've learned about Margaret Thatcher. It only made me want to look deeper into her life as this felt more like fluff than biographical film. The only good thing this movie presented was the love and adoration Thatcher felt for her husband. Even a story revolving solely around that would have made a better film.esting.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|A very good read and highly motivational. The book lacked specific details (how exactly did John get all his Twitter followers?) and did self-promote his other work constantly, but the useful content more than made this acceptable and is a definite must-read for any modern author.
B007549YM4|2.0|I'm amazed at the movies that depict the results of a nuclear war and how they've changed over the years. In the past, during my childhood years, there was always a sense of hope and cooperation between survivors in those films. During my teen years we were treated to the terrifying glimpse of the reality of the results of this form of war. And now as I've grown older, it seems a new generation feels that man can not do anything but remain destructive and petty. Where has all the hope gone?<br /><br />THE DIVIDE opens with a nuclear bomb going off while Eva (Lauren German) watches from the window in her high rise apartment. Her boyfriend grabs her arm and they rush off down the stairs hoping to find an escape. Instead when they get to the lobby, they find themselves nearly crushed as the tide of people come running back in to avoid the blast wave and, fortunately for them, they have the chance to join a few that have made it to a bomb shelter in the basement.<br /><br />The shelter was kept up by the apartment building's super, Mickey (Michael Biehn). And Mickey now intends to rule this basement as he sees fit, sharing what he has with the rest but by with certain restrictions. Some of the people want to leave but Mickey explains to them that the dust from the bomb will make the chances of survival outside next to impossible. It's better to wait it out till things settle.<br /><br />Tempers and egos flare as each person wants to make their own decisions, failing to take into consideration that simply opening the door could do them all in. The posturing of males wanes back and forth while Mickey still controls them all in his most unpleasant manner.<br /><br />The psychological aspects of being alive but trapped in a shelter play out throughout this film offering us little hope in a world where people care about one another but would rather focus on themselves only. Eventually help does arrive or so it seems. Instead the protective suited armed group that enters doesn't aid all but just a little girl in their midst. When members of this group later try to find out what's going on, the military welds shut the door and leaves them to themselves. Will they release them later? Who knows?<br /><br />Before that day can happen the group begins to change. Not only physically but mentally as well. Life among the living deteriorates and the basest behaviors are displayed among them all. It becomes a sad tale in a world where insane attitudes seem to rule.<br /><br />I'm not averse to movies that depict the world as it is. But it seems that these days a younger generation seems to have no hope in mankind or the world we live in. We've gone from a world where a generation dreamed of reaching to the stars to a world where we accept defeat at the hands of bombs. A new generation of film makers seems to see the worst mankind has to offer and expects that to be the norm rather than the exception. Then again with the self absorbed youths of today perhaps they're on to something.<br /><br />It may seem as if I've revealed quite a bit about this movie, but most of it could have been witnessed in the trailer. There is much more that happens and all of it depressing as Hell. to me that's not entertainment. I couldn't find much that I could recommend about this film unless none of the things mentioned bothers you. Director Xavier Gens also made the film FRONTIERS which many touted as the best film they'd seen in years. I found that movie to be more disturbing than entertaining as well.

B0058EZHYC|5.0|When i first received this blu-ray in the mail, i was afraid to watch it after reading some of the poor reviews about the cameras.  I have now watched the main show 4 times and the camera work is AWESOME.  It does switch a lot but that is so you can see everything that is going on.  It adds to the enjoyment...As far as one guy saying that the cameras are on the bass player during guitar solos, i'm afraid this guy needs glasses or he doesn't know what a guitar looks like....LOL... Everytime John Norum takes off on one of his patented guitar shredding solos, the camera is right there on John, sometimes right up close on the guitar and sometimes backed off where you can see him and his guitar...The bonus show at the Stockholm ice rink is another full concert with 13 songs..Many of the songs are different from the Shepherd's Bush show...The fairgrounds show is only 3 songs and a guitar solo, but hey, what more can you ask for...Well, there is more..There is a behind the scenes feature and 2 bonus music videos...This blu-ray is well worth the usual 30-35 dollars that you have to pay for a new blu-ray, but i ordered my Blu-Ray from a company called Deep discount_dvd_cd, and it was 6.99....Not a misprint, 6 dollars and 99 cents for a BRAND NEW NEVER OPENED BLU-RAY WITH 2 FULL CONCERTS AND ALL THE OTHER EXTRAS... Oh yeah, the Sound Mix is off the charts also...The louder i turned it, the better it sounded, no distortion at loud levels...In my opinion if you like Europe even a little bit, grab this blu-ray as soon as you can...IT IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!!!!!
B006OB3K56|1.0|Perhaps I've grown a bit jaded over the years. At 54 years old I've seen all sorts of movies. I've seen everything from low budget movies that were impressive to high budget movies that were terrible and the other way round. I've seen movies that were supposed to be great that I hated and movies that were supposed to be terrible that I loved. I've seen movies that were supposed to be high brow dramas that I agreed with. And then I've seen movies like this one that had all the trappings of high brow intellectual crap that critics love to meander over that in truth were nothing less than boring.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender stars as Brandon, a young executive on the rise. Things seem to be going well for him professionally but personally not much so. Brandon is a character lacking something in his life. For the most part he has little if no love life going for him. At the same time, his sex life is exploding. Brandon is a sex addict of sorts. If he's not paying some high priced call girl for her time, he's surfing sex sites online or having sex conversations there as well. Personally his life is a mess.<br /><br />If this weren't bad enough, Brandon's sister enters his life as well. Sissy is another totally messed up individual. Having been through many men in the hopes of finding the right one, she always seems to pick the losers. After a recent split she asks if she can stay at his place for a while. He relents and she invites him to see her perform at a local club. He finds it hard to believe she's found work but is stunned when she does well.<br /><br />So now you have the set up of the story. And honestly it doesn't go much further than this. Each character's interaction with each other and Brandon's interaction with a woman he is attracted to despite his emotional problems make for the gist of the film. Long conversations that lead no where, revelations that aren't surprising and the lack of a character to feel sorry for, to sympathize with, make this one long boring film.<br /><br />As I said earlier, there are films that critics love to praise with pseudo-intellectual clap trap, discussing the symbolism of what the director intended or how the actors were able to display intensity with a subtle nuance.

B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|It seems that we've never had a female version of the James Bond character. Certainly Bond has had his share of femme fatales but never has one taken the lead role in a film. The closest we've had in the past was Cynthia Rothrock who starred in a series of martial arts films, but those were always B movie quality. That all changes with HAYWIRE.<br /><br />MMA star Gina Carano starts as Mallory Kane, an operative for a private group that hires out to the likes of the CIA. An ex-Marine, Mallory is more tomboy than girly girl. As the film opens she makes her way to a diner where she meets up with Aaron (Channing Tatum), a fellow operative sent to bring her in. When she refuses the first of many well choreographed fight sequences begins. Mallory escapes and is on the run with a young man from the diner in tow. As they speed off she begins to tell him her tale.<br /><br />It all went sour with a job in Barcelona. Mallory's boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) has sent her out at the request of Coblenz (Michael Douglas), the head of a secret government agency one would assume is the CIA, and fellow spymaster Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas). It should be a simple snatch and grab, rescuing a hostage and taking him home. When one of the guards for the hostage takes off, Mallory chases him down resulting in another well choreographed fight sequence.<br /><br />Home after the run Mallory finds Kenneth waiting for her and asking her to do one more job before some well earned time off. This time the job takes her to Ireland where she is to meet up with a member of MI-6 named Paul (Michael Fassbender). At a party hosted by some big wig, Mallory wanders around and discovers the hostage from the Barcelona affair with a bullet in his head. Something seems wrong which becomes painfully obvious when Paul tries to kill Mallory when they return to their hotel room. He doesn't succeed.<br /><br />Traveling home with the intent of revenge, Mallory has ended where we found her at the beginning of the film. Just who she can and can not trust is in question. The only person she does is her father, an ex-military man himself (played by Bill Paxton). When a hit squad with Kenneth shows there the chances of their survival are slim even though they exude confidence. How the film finishes, just who was it that was behind all the skullduggery and who will pay make for a fine film.<br /><br />Directed by Steven Soderbergh this is not his usual style of film. This outing into the world of action adventure shows he is quite capable. While not quite up to par with the Bourne films, the movie does take its action sequences seriously and shoots them in the way they should be shot, with the camera back a way so we can actually watch the fight scenes rather than in the middle looking for close ups.<br /><br />The story is well written and thought out though it takes a while to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps more clues along the way would have upped the ante here, but as it is the movie still tells a compelling story.<br /><br />The movie seems made for Carano, forming around her and her incredible fighting skills, showing them off as best as they can. One would think that her acting ability would be lacking but she demonstrates an ability to do better than most real life action stars pushed into the world of film. Her character does offer a rather stoic look more often than not, but for a first feature role she does outstanding. Future films will tell if she can get the acting chops she needs or not.<br /><br />For an action film the action must be non-stop and well thought out. It must be paced at regular intervals and those scenes must work well within the story. That is done here in spades. It also must feature someone who can handle the action as well as co-stars who can do the same. That's also well done here, including having Fassbender do his own stunts in the fight sequence he performs with Carano. It all results in a fast paced, well made action film that's worthyour rental fee.your rental fee.

B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.<br /><br />The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.<br /><br />On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.<br /><br />Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.<br /><br />Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?<br /><br />Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.<br /><br />The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out.e, their terror seems real as well.<br /><br />The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces.

B0073U2F2Q|3.0|Forget the cowboys/alien movie, this one offers more entertainment. THE DARKEST HOUR begins with two young inventor/businessmen traveling to Russia to make a deal for the newest internet craze they've come up with, a hook up site that offers directions to the hottest nightclubs and more for anyone joining. Unfortunately their idea was stolen by their Russian partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman) and they've been tossed aside. After traveling halfway around the world to find a failed business adventure what do they do? What all twenty somethings do, head to the local clubs to hook up!<br /><br />Ben (Max Minghella) is the smart one who came up with the program while Sean (Emile Hirsch) is the one with the supposed business savvy that got them there. Having used the program earlier in the day they're at the hottest spot and hoping to meet two fellow Americans, Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and her friend Anne (Rachel Taylor). While partying hard a noise outside drives the crowd to the doors to see what the commotion was. They discover what they first think is a lightshow in the sky. In reality it's an invasion of aliens hurtling to the Earth.<br /><br />The first encounter they all witness is a policeman walking up to a fluctuating, glowing mass that looks like a holographic image floating in the street. When he pokes it, the alien wraps around him and disintegrates the policeman before the eyes of the crowd who immediately panic and begin seeking shelter. As they run various members of the scene are disintegrated one by one and our heroes only escape with luck by hiding in the backroom of the club. Along with them and necessary to help them translate is none other than Skyler.<br /><br />After several days they travel out to see what has happened. It's basically the end of the world as we know it with no one in sight. They learn how to tell if the aliens are nearby since the energy that flows from these creatures brings light bulbs to full glow. Using this method they travel the city in hopes of finding other survivors and to see what's happened.<br /><br />They do find others and join with them in hopes of finding help. A radio signal lets them all know that a Russian sub will be located in a pier on one of the main rivers running through Moscow but only till a certain time. It seems the aliens can't see through the water or through glass which reflects light. They head out encountering other survivors fighting back and taking the chance of being picked off one by one before they can make it to the sub.<br /><br />The movie does have a rather simplistic plot at use here but it works. This is a classic sci-fi low budget flick produced with a much larger budget and a bit of creativity. The concept used for the aliens is cost effective yet works, giving us something we haven't seen before. As the heroes find a way to somewhat short circuit the alien's force fields we get a crude glimpse of them and don't have the need to see more.<br /><br />But its not just sci-fi being used here. While I watched I thought back to films like RED DAWN (amusing since this film takes place in Russia) where we had a group of teens trying to take on an enemy far advanced than they are at that age. The combination of sci-fi and action make this film work.<br /><br />Perhaps what made this movie more interesting yet for me was the fact that it was actually shot in Russia, something that would have been unheard of 10-20 years ago. Times have definitely changed, but movie perhaps not as much. The locations take center stage much of the time as we get a glimpse of a country we've not been privy to for long. And after the history the U.S. and Russia have shared, it's also nice to see characters from both countries uniting to take on a common enemy.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film is not an Oscar contender but it doesn't pretend to be that either. It is what it is, a simple sci-fi film that tells a story and tries to get us involved with characters in the shortest amount of time possible. This is Roger Corman with the chance to play in the big boy's sandbox and it offers a nice evening's entertainment.rtest amount of time possible.

Adults don't need the love of their parents the way children do, because adults have (hopefully) had the love of their parents for a very long time. Children don't have that benefit of a long history of love, they just have the now, and they want the knowledge that their view of your love will last forever.<br /><br />My son is 9. We don't sit down and read this book anymore, but when he's feeling sentimental I'll say the poem to him and he calls it \\"his song.\\" When he's an adult will he want me breaking into his house? Of course not. But when he was 3, 4, and 5, it was comforting to him that mommies can love their babies forever and ever. Which is exactly what I thought of the book when I was a child.<br /><br />I remember his questions to me when he was so young. \\"Will you still love me when I'm a grown up and I have a job?\\" Yes, of course. \\"Will I still be your baby if I have to move away?\\" Yes, of course. \\"Can I just live with you forever?\\" Yes, of course. I know he won't want to live with me forever, just as one day he'll realize I won't be driving to god knows where with a ladder strapped to the roof of my car. However, I will love him forever, I will like him for always, as long as I'm living, my baby he'll be.
B004LWZW8S|3.0|The genre of film known as \\"sword and sandal\\" has gone up and down over the years. A staple of films in the late 50s and early 60s the genre lost favor when the age of the anti-hero and film student film makers took over. But in 2000 that changed when GLADIATOR hit the screens and planted Russell Crowe firmly in the position of movie star. More movies followed like TROY and 300. And so it is we now have the latest film based on Greek mythology, IMMORTALS.<br /><br />The story opens by telling us the history of the Gods of Greece, having risen up against the Titans and imprisoning them in Mount Tartarus. The only weapon on Earth that could possibly free the Titans and thus open the world to a war among Gods once more is the Epirus bow, now being sought by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke).<br /><br />As the army of Hyperion moves forward in search of the bow, villages fall and inhabitants try to stay one step ahead avoiding capture. Young Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a highly skilled warrior trained by an old man in his village (John Hurt). But since his birth was the result of his mother being raped, both are looked down upon and when the time comes to leave they are left behind. This results in Theseus' mother's death when the village is attacked by Hyperion's men and Theseus is captured.<br /><br />While this is going on Hyperion has captured the oracle Phaedra in hopes that she will lead him to the bow he seeks. But it is visions of Theseus that fill her head and she knows that he is the key to stopping Hyperion. When their paths cross Theseus helps leads a revolt against the few guards that hold them prisoner organized by Phaedra and with the help of a thief named Stavros (Stephen Dorff) they set out to bury his mother in his home village.<br /><br />While in the village they discover that the Epirus bow was buried there all along. Theseus recovers the bow but is attacked by Hyperion's beast the Minotaur. Theseus survives and knows his destiny lies in stopping Hyperion. They travel to Phaedra's home only to be overtaken by Hyperion's men and losing the bow. Now it's up to Theseus to join the army that stands against Hyperion and prevent the release of the Titans. And this is just the main story going on here.<br /><br />Along the way Theseus and Phaedra fall in love, politicians fall for Hyperion's tricks and nearly cause the downfall of the civilized world and the Gods speak to Theseus. It seems that the person who trained him was Zeus posing as the old man. Having already told the rest of the Gods that they are not to interfere, he tells Theseus that the Gods can not assist man; they must shine on their own. These were the rules written long ago when the Titans were first imprisoned.<br /><br />Of course this all means that we're bound to see a major battle scene involving the good army against the bad one, a face off between Theseus and Hyperion and the possibility of the release of the Titans if Theseus doesn't quite take care of things. And should they be released, a battle among Gods will surely follow.<br /><br />The movie offers the tale of a hero extremely well and perhaps it's time we told stories of heroes once again. It seems there we find few out there these days in the spotlight and so many are toppled from their pedestals by those who feel we need more truth and less heroes. Myself I'm glad we have heroes to inspire us even if they are in movies and stories only.<br /><br />The special effects are dazzling to watch and fit nicely into the story rather than take it over. Battle scenes are bloody but they would have been since they involved more bludgeoning and blades than anything else. But at least those involved have that gritty look to them as opposed to the freshly starched togas seen in some films.<br /><br />The acting done by all shines here, especially Cavill. That's great to see since he's been tapped to portray Superman in the new film being made. He has the presence to carry that role off which many wereconcerned about when he was named. If he can make you believe he's the Grecian hero seen here then Superman should be a breeze.<br /><br />The movies being turned out in this genre have all been exceptional and well worth our time as a viewing audience. Many have been worth adding to our collections, including this one. Let's just hope they continue to make them and then discover that the past treasures deserve blu-ray treatment as well. For now we'll have to be content watching releases like IMMORTALS which offer tremendous entertainment.concerned about when he was named.

0345803507|1.0|I have read all three books now. The first two were not literary masterpieces, but the story moved quickly enough that it was bearable to read them. For the third book.. it seems the author cut and pasted bits and pieces from the first two books.. didn't progress the story in any meaningful way and pretty much wasted 5 hours of my time. It will waste your time as well if you allow it to.<br />In this book... Christian has a new name.. \\"Fifty\\"... calling him Fifty in her head... is a way that Ana reminds herself how screwed up he is and how stupid she is.<br />This book is a mix of teen-pop songs \\"Oh... what you do to me\\"... in a way that would make you believe that real humans talk this way in real life.<br />I almost threw up half-way through the book... it was so mind numbingly boring that it made me nauseous.<br />It was a wonder that I even finished the book... considering that it was 578 pages of useless drivel that would have easily fit in 100 pages, had Ms. James had a better editor.<br />There are obvious grammatical errors (an earring) just like the first two books, the emails are no longer funny, Ana's personality completely disappears as she fights with Christian just because she can.<br />Hundreds of pages are dedicated to descriptions of a boring honeymoon, with no interesting conversation.<br />The epilogue is almost 50 pages long... they may as well have made it into a new book.<br />When you have read spectacular romance writing (Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Judith MacNaught, Linda Howard, Julie Garwood), it is really hard to figure out how Ms. James got this last book published.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|I usually read non-fiction, but sometimes I need a little brain candy.  This was that book.<br /><br />This book was nice to read, well written, and I think I only saw one or two of those weird Kindlization errors.  It was engaging enough that I read it quickly and was moderately entertained throughout.  I will say this book wasn't all that deep, I didn't really think all that much throughout the book.  The characters weren't super developed or complicated (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're looking for!) and the book had a natural flow, where events unravel at a natural pace that was neither oddly quick and convenient nor so slow that the book becomes a drag.  The main character tended to have some whiny moments which were started to aggravate me towards the end, but otherwise, the characters were somewhat relatable.  I wouldn't say that I loved this book (a read again type of book) because it's sort of a predictable click lit book which isn't really my preferred genre.  I wish I could do half stars, but I'll round up to 4 rather than down to 3 since, as I've stated, I was out of my usual genre and I really don't tend to like a lot of these types of books anyway.  Besides, even though the book was mostly ordinary and expected, I still enjoyed the ride.  :-)

I've purchased many a box set, from Showtime (DEXTER) to AMC (MAD MEN, THE WALKING DEAD) TO Warner Bros. (BATMAN BEYOND), and all were dual-layer. As were a great many of the HBO series I own (SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD, THE WIRE, ROME, CARNIVALE). What gives HBO? As for the series itself, I did enjoy it. The first half seemed slow, but the season picked up steam after that. I'm in for the long haul, but not happy that this product appears to have been manufactured on the cheap.

Games are entertaining enough to be challenging but brief enough to get you back to your research paper after a break. great for study breaks.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am a long-time fan of erotica and good erotica - like good sex - must titillate your brain as well as your body.  Compelling characters and plot lines developed with engaging language are entirely as important to erotica as to any other genre.  James however, gives us idiotic dialogue, predictable scenarios and unlikable characters, depending on us to overlook the (way) sub-par writing in favor of some mild DBSM.  Actually, a lot of erotic fiction writers do better sex scenes but very few demonstrate such a sad lack of writing skills.<br /><br />Only a woman with misogynistic leanings would have developed a character as utterably annoying as Ana and then ask us to believe that a gorgeous, rich, troubled young man would fall desperately in love with her.  And not only fall in love, he's going to change for her!  So along with validating immature behavior, James is telling all her young single female readers: \\"The right woman can change a man\\".  That's entirely bad enough but then James shows us that Ana is going to affect this change by being combative, nagging, weepy, pushy, unappreciative and unreasonably jealous.  I wanted to slap her by page 40.<br /><br />Of course, Ana is a 21 year-old virgin who just happens to have no gag reflex and intuitively knows how to give an A+ b*** j** (Amazon won't let me spell it out!) so for her perhaps all things are possible. But, if I were Christian I'd dump the moron and her freaking lip biting tic asap.<br /><br />GadgetChick and DS from LA have it right.  It's a sad commentary on our collective American stupidity that we've made such an atrocious book a bestseller.<br /><br />Erotica has a long literary history so pass on this and try Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron (circa 1350), Anaïs Nin or A.N. Roquelaure (Anne Rice).
0316776963|5.0|This is one of those books where you have to finish reading the chapter before judging it.  At first, what David talks about seems judgmental - ie talking about the teacher that he didn't think of as human, or the midget teacher; however once you get to the end, he ties everything together very well and in  a way make the reader feel guilty about all of the times we've judged someone and found out they were just like us.<br /><br />Becoming one of my favorite Authors.

B005LAIHKY|2.0|*possible spoilers*<br /><br />When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were collaborating in making a Dark Shadows movie, I squealed like the biggest fan girl ever. Being both a huge fan both Burton and Depp while being a fan of Dark Shadows, I thought I was getting the best of both worlds.  When I started to see production photos slowly coming out, I thought they got it spot on, until that trailer came out... Disco music, comedy, really?  Still, I went this past Friday into the movie with no expectations..... And lets just say it's not the Dark Shadows your mother grew up with.<br /><br />The movie starts out great with an original story line from the show.  Barnabas Collins and his family create Collinwood and Collinsport.  He then spurns the love a servant girl named Angelique and falls in love with another girl by the name of Jossette.  Angelique, being a witch, curses both of them.  Jossette falls to her death and Barnabas is turned into a Vampire.  He is then locked away in a chained coffin by angry mod, led by Angelique.<br /><br />Fast forward 200 years.  Collinwood and Collinsport still stand.  The Collins family still endure with only a couple members remaining: Elizabeth Stoddard and her daughter Caroline, Elizabeth's brother Roger and his son David.  There's Willy Loomis, their groundskeeper, Mrs. Johnson, a maid (who served no purpose but to stand around and pretend to be an old crazy person), Dr. Julia Hoffman, David's always drunken slosh psychiatrist, and soon they're joined by Victoria Winters (aka Maggie Evans) who comes on as David's governess.  Already, Vicki's character is pushed into the wayside many times in the film, although you would assume she would have a bigger part as being the reincarnation of Jossette.  She only appears when it suits Barnabas' scenes.<br /><br />Depp's Barnabas awakens in 1972 by a construction crew building a Mcdonalds.  Already starts the downfall from here.  Instead of being the serious Barnabas in the opening of the film, Depp plays him as a bumbling fool, all wigged out about all the \\"weird\\" things he sees along the way (the giant glowing McDonalds M, cars, lava lamps, etc.)  In the television show, Barnabas had put Willy under control and then seemingly planted himself in place with no issues and charm the Collins family in letting him stay at Collinwood.  Never did they know he was a vampire either, as they spill in this movie.<br /><br />Another character dynamic they got all wrong was that of Dr. Hoffman.  In the television show, she was a doctor that dealt blood diseases, thus trying to always cure Barnabas of his curse.  She was always the voice of concern and did develop a friendship with Barnabas. Helena Carter's portrayal is far from the loving doctor we know, where she is constantly drunk, uses sexual favors to get what she wants and instead of finding a cure for Barnabas, she has other plans on how to use his blood.<br /><br />You find out later on that the Collins are almost broke due to another company called Angel Bay.  You can see where this is going.  Angel could be short for Angelique maybe?  Eva Green did Lara Parker a grave injustice by portraying Angelique as some sad, desperate slut who happens to be a witch.  Hilarity ensues, there's conflict, and a big climatic ending.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this film is while it made many references to the television show, Burton and Depp had made this more of a campy comedy rather than a serious soap opera.  Granted the television show was know for it's very campy drama and occasional bloopers in scenes.  But it still managed to be serious when it needed to be.  I think the biggest mistake was to let Seth Grahame-Smith (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) write the screenplay.  He's know for writing humorous spoofs and that's what he did with this. Sure it had it's moments, but to do that through out was a mistake.  Another thing that was wrong was all the \\"surprises\\" they made.  Caroline turns intoa werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling the audience to \\"deal with it.\\"  Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it.  It was lame.<br /><br />The only thing rewarding about this film was the performances of Jackie Earl Haley (Willie) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth).  Even Belle Heathcote (Victoria) had a great performance, it's ashame they didn't give her more.<br /><br />Out of all the Burton/Depp movies, this one was my least favorite.  That's very hard to say, considering I love all of the films they've made over the years.  It had so much potential, but they ruined it.  I prefer my cheezy soap opera.  It's like they made 2 different movies, one serious and one humorous.  They should've worked more on it, made it serious and released it on Halloween.  Would've been more fitting that way.a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling the audience to \\"deal with it.\\"  Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it.

B007Z9RAX4|1.0|What a waste of time and money! Certainly not in the class of Soderbergh movies I have previously experienced. In fact I still find it difficult to believe that he actually directed this film.  Why do I watch a movie?  To be entertained.  This was not entertainment in any shape or form. It was patchy, it relied on confusing \\"flash backs\\" and apart from the few short fight scenes, it was totally boring.  Certainly not what the preview would have us believe. I do not doubt Gina Carano's MMA credentials, but after watching this I sure do doubt her acting credentials. Looking pretty (even after having been beaten up) does not an actor make.  Perhaps the bigger name actors (Douglas and Banderos) were added to try and give the movie some credibility. If that were the case, it failed.<br />Another reviewer stated that he watched the movie the whole way through in the hope that it may get better (which apparently did not happen). I managed to get about half way through it and just knew that it was never going to get better.  But hey, this is just my opinion. There may be some who find the movie appealing. If you do, great.  Just don't hold your breath waiting for it to happen.

B004LROUW2|5.0|I read the Kindle version of this novel, the first of Murakami's novels that I have ever read.  I cannot attest to his popularity/reputation or how this novel matches with that, but I can say that this novel is very, very good.<br /><br />I will warn, however, that the first quarter or so of the book is divergent from the actual tone and feel of the rest of the novel.  After reading a couple of hundred pages into the novel, my mind harkened back to Stieg Larson's Millennium Trilogy (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, etc.).  While I enjoyed those novels, I was a bit disappointed because, while they were entertaining, I felt that they lacked true literary merit.<br /><br />After continuing reading, however, I realized that Murakami was just laying the foundation for the interesting world that he had built.  The characters in this novel are consistently multidimensional, and the plot is constantly evolving.  But unlike a book that just serves an entertainment purpose, this novel really seems to have something to say regarding what it means to love and live in an unpredictable world.  Jonathan Franzen once said that \\"The most purely autobiographical ­fiction requires pure invention.\\"  Much in the same way, Murakami's strange and unusual world seems to carry a particularly resonant and relevant message of life in our own world.<br /><br />This novel is not without its minor quirks.  I found a couple of particular issues a bit distracting at times.  For one, I felt that the characters occasionally made unintuitive logical leaps.  In other words, the characters would come to correct conclusions that, based on the facts that were at their disposal, they really should not have been able to come to.  Also, Murakami often has an odd fascination with both sex and description of female anatomy (I am not the first person to notice this, but descriptions of characters' breasts and breast sizes are frequent throughout).  Perhaps this is a cultural or translation issue, but for me it was distracting.<br /><br />Overall, though, these minor flaws do little to detract from an outstanding world and story.t was distracting.<br /><br />Overall, though, these minor flaws do little to detract from an outstanding world and story.

B005QMOZOO|2.0|I'm a fan of Jane Austen and probably shouldn't have expected that anyone could write an acceptable sequel to Pride & Prejudice.  I did think that PD James would at least write a mystery that would engage the attention.<br />The book fails on every level as far as I'm concerned.  Elizabeth's lively and fun loving nature is completely absent.  In fact the characters are all without any sort of life or resemblance to those penned by Austen.<br />The resolution of the murder doesn't even make much sense and it was a penance to finish the book.<br />Fortunately it is so bad that it is instantly forgettable.

I have not had the opportunity to read the entire book but hearing him laugh as he read, gave me an indication that he enjoyed it.  I specially like that I purchased it for his Kindle.  Buying the book on the Kindle makes his backpack lighter.  In a previous year, I had to buy 5 books.  Although they weren't heavy, the fact that he had to carry them in his backpack, made his backpack bulking.

0307594165|5.0|Toni Morrison is one of those rare novelists whose work has achieved the pinnacle of both critical and popular success. She's a Nobel Prize-winning author (the last American to have won, in fact, in 1993) whose novels have been made into feature films and included in Oprah's Book Club. Her books --- especially BELOVED, THE BLUEST EYE and SONG OF SOLOMON --- are staples of college literature, women's studies, and ethnic studies classrooms. But what can be easy to forget amid all these accolades, both high and low, is the mix of loveliness, power and horror that lies at the center of Morrison's writing. This make her novels so exhilarating and heartbreaking to read.<br /><br />At only 145 pages long, narrated in a relatively straightforward style, HOME is certainly Morrison's most accessible novel in recent memory. Despite its size, though, it packs in some big ideas and weighty American themes, as she tells a story that is both expansive in its scope and intimate in its focus.<br /><br />Frank Money (the puns Morrison makes on his name are numerous and delightfully inventive) is on his way home to Georgia following a tour of service in the Korean War. His two best friends --- his closest friends since childhood --- have been killed in brutal ways, and he himself carries scars that no one else can see. He's shell-shocked and aimless, horrified by the extent of racial division in the United States after years of fighting alongside white men in an integrated military.<br /><br />A simple letter, however, provides the motivation Frank needs to make this difficult and dangerous journey. All through his childhood, Frank was the protector and substitute parent for his little sister, Cee. Now, he has learned that Cee is in danger from some unspecified source and may, in fact, already be dead. Rescuing her may restore Frank's sense of himself, but it may also drive him toward more memories he wishes could stay buried.<br /><br />In a novel this slim by a novelist this talented, every single word and detail carry massive importance. Some of Morrison's verbal agility is playful (like her puns), some is horrific (like the descriptions of Frank's war losses or of Cee's own damaged body), and some is straightforward brilliant, as she elegantly says so much with so few words. \\"They practiced what they had been taught by their mothers,\\" she writes of the women who tend to Cee's battered body, \\"during the period that rich people called the Depression and they called life.\\"<br /><br />Morrison's narrative, though straightforward and supremely readable, is also unsurprisingly deep and complex. Individual chapters are told from the points of view of Frank and Cee, as well as a couple of other characters (namely the siblings' grandmother and Frank's former girlfriend). Some chapters are vignettes from the past, set in italics and seeming at times to address the storyteller herself and to question her representational techniques. The result is a novel that can be enjoyed on different levels by different sorts of readers, but whose indelible images will reside with all of them universally.<br /><br />HOME offers an often bleak view of race and class in the second half of the 20th century, to be sure, but it also --- in both small moments and greater truths --- offers glimpses of grace and hope. \\"Look to yourself,\\" says one woman to a slowly-healing Cee. \\"You free. Nothing and nobody is obliged to save you but you. Seed your own land. You young and a woman and there's serious limitation in both, but you a person too.... Somewhere inside you is that free person I'm talking about. Locate her and let her do some good in the world.\\" The ground may seem barren and the prospects for a good harvest unlikely at best, but Morrison's characters are resilient, and in their strength and fragile freedom lie their best chance for a future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B001DJLCRC|1.0|I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the \\"hype\\" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those \\"con\\" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.
0143121006|5.0|It is surprising, even amazing, that the historical true crime book MIDNIGHT IN PEKING works as well as it does. Its dark subject matter (the brutal murder of a teenage English schoolgirl); an unfamiliar setting (Peking in the late 1930s) as Japanese soldiers have all but invaded China; and unusual authorship (Paul French is a financial writer and analyst, as opposed to a mystery writer) would seem to mitigate against success on any number of levels. Yet MIDNIGHT IN PEKING grabs the reader from the first paragraph and reads with all the suspense and immediacy of a work of fiction.<br /><br />Credit for this is properly and fittingly given to French himself. A treatise concerning itself with the instant subject matter --- a decades-old murder in a foreign country --- could have been an unmitigated disaster in lesser hands. Fortunately, though, French knows his territory, and where to look when researching an event that occurred over 70 years ago. He brings an understated but very real empathy to the table --- not only for the victim, a troubled, high-spirited girl who, as the old saying goes, got in with the wrong crowd, but also for her adoptive, widowed father, a man given to succumbing to his own impulses and excesses but who channeled his grief over his daughter's death into a relentless search for the truth.<br /><br />French infuses his description of Peking in the opening days of 1937 with a dark and haunting immediacy, primarily by utilizing his own considerable prosaic talent (not what one might expect from a financial analyst). MIDNIGHT IN PEKING begins with the discovery of a body in the early morning hours of January 8th. It is determined to be that of Pamela Werner, who had been reported as missing by her father, a former British counsel, on the previous night. The murder would have been remarkable in any event, but the violence visited upon the body lends a particularly horrific aspect to the young woman's death.<br /><br />The investigation commences almost immediately, but there are complications from the start. The authorities are faced with the death of an Englishwoman in the Chinese section of Peking. As French notes in his narrative, it was the practice when a foreign died under suspicious circumstances in Peking for the appropriate legation (British, in this case) to be invited to nominate an official to monitor the investigation, though with no real power other than as an observer. The task falls to Detective Chief Inspector Richard Dennis, a \\"copper\\" through and through who finds himself chafing somewhat under the restrictions he faces. Further, the Chinese official in charge of the investigation --- Colonel Han Shih-Ching --- has no power to interrogate or search members of the British Legation without permission.<br /><br />The result is that the investigators can get only so close to identifying Pamela's murderer, but no closer, as they attempt to trace her whereabouts during her last hours of life and ascertain a motive for her murder. What Han and Dennis do discover is that there were two very different Pamela Werners: one a quiet schoolgirl, the other a rebellious spirit beyond her father's control. The men also uncover a number of secrets beneath the staid surface appearances of the British expatriates in Peking during that time, a tumultuous period during which the Japanese empire was encroaching upon China while the Chinese government's control of its borders was almost non-existent.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, the investigation into Pamela's murder was closed as \\"unsolved.\\" Still, her father refused to give up. Throwing his remaining fortune behind his own investigation, the elder Werner channeled his unrelenting grief over the loss of his daughter into the pursuit of her killer and, given that he had no jurisdictional restrictions, came closer than anyone to determining who may well have been behind her death and why.<br /><br />It was Werner's notes that provided part of the impetus behindthe writing of MIDNIGHT IN PEKING, but the success of the book is due to French's remarkable ability to spark the reader's interest in events of long ago and far away, and, ultimately, to care about the victim. The book's last paragraphs are particularly chilling, a dark ending point for a fascinating journey that moves quickly and memorably.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

0307716546|5.0|Grace is a wife and mother who finds herself trapped in her own body when she awakens in a hospital. She can't open her eyes or move a finger. She yearns to scream, but is unable. Using every fiber of her will, she tries to move the heaviness of her inert body, until she finally slips free of it, emerging into the gleaming sterile whiteness of the room, where she gazes at her own comatose body as a doctor pries open her eyes. Addressing her husband, she explains how she became unconscious and unresponsive.<br /><br />Grace remembers that it's sports day at the school their son Adam attends. It also happens to be his eighth birthday. On this day, Grace's 17-year-old daughter, Jenny, has been assigned to work as the school nurse. Grace is horrified by this idea, saying it's too much responsibility for a teen, but Jenny laughs off her fears, saying it's just a sports day, not a car race. She will be fine, up in the third-floor nurse's office. Grace is out on the Sidley House playing field watching the students run races when Adam asks if he can retrieve his birthday cake from inside the school. Rowena, the teenage daughter of Grace's friend Maisie, offers to go with him. While he's gone, Grace watches for Jenny, who should arrive on the field any minute.<br /><br />When Adam doesn't return immediately, Grace looks at the school building and sees thick black smoke pouring from it. Knowing her children are in danger, she races for the building. She is relieved to see that Adam is outside the school, being comforted by Rowena. Not seeing Jenny, though, she runs into the burning building, choking on the smoke and screaming her  name. She knows Jenny is on the third floor, so she fights her way through flames and smoke, climbing stairs until she finds her. Grace drags Jenny toward the school's doors, but before she can reach the bottom of the stairway, something hits her. She falls and everything goes black.<br /><br />Now, in the hospital, watching her own body being worked on by medical personnel, Grace knows she must find Jenny again. She screams at doctors and nurses, demanding they tell her where her daughter is. No one can hear her. She is both invisible and silent to everyone else. Finally, Grace discovers Jenny in the emergency room, so badly burnt as to be unrecognizable. She only realizes this terribly damaged patient is her daughter when she sees Jenny's sandals on the bed. When Grace shouts Jenny's name, she hears an answering voice. While medical staff wheel the stretcher with Jenny's physical body on it, she puts her arms around the Jenny who is crouched on the floor, asking, \\"What are we, Mum?\\" Grace doesn't know the answer to this question, but she doesn't have time to contemplate it. As she watches and listens, she discovers a terrible mystery that she must solve in order to protect her family.<br /><br />Author Rosamund Lupton spins an unusual yet completely believable tale centered on a mother's determination to do whatever it takes to keep her kids safe, even though her body is incapacitated. It is difficult to decide what to praise most highly in AFTERWARDS. Should it be the people who live and breathe on these pages? The perfect pacing of the plot? The intriguing who-done-it puzzle? The ticking-clock urgency of Grace's quest to help her children? All of these elements work together in this marvelous page-turner, surely destined for many \\"Best Of\\" lists.<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
0345803485|1.0|Grey is nothing but a predator who radars in on an innocent named Anastasia. He grooms her with his power, money ultimately seducing her for some soft form of S&M.<br /><br />I find it disturbing that so many women are drawn to this. Erotica? Sure, let's send this message to young girls and women. Real nice.<br /><br />The thing that keeps the interest is the hope that Ana wakes up and gets a spine. As some others have said, the rest gets repetitive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really awesome. My son love it it is very time consuming! Although when you update it you have to start all over!
0439023521|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I did not care to read it.  I am way to into Vampire books and such.  Anyway my sister in law told me that I just had to read it.  So I figured what the heck I would try it.  It took a few chapters for me to get interested. Probably not until the interviews of the triubutes the night before they enter the arena.  Peeta's caught my attention.  I got so into this book that I couldn't wait to get to the second book.  A really good read and you won't be able to put the book down.  I would stay up late reading.  I liked it that much.  It's full of love, passion and adventure.  Definietly read it and believe me you won't want to put the book down. Yeah, it is that good.
B000UD08HW|3.0|Well, the songs of course.. are fine, the quality of the video and the music recording are NOT SO GOOD. It was a real dissapointment for me. If you watching this on a 25\\" TV with 4:3 ratio and a mono speaker... then you might like it. But, if you are in it for the HD visual and 5.1 or 7.1 experience... look elswhere.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app on my kindle fire. gameplay is smooth and fun!  I would recommend this game for children and your child at heart.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|An excellent guide to creating web pages.  Focus is taken away from verbose corporate PR chatter to comments that are relevant to potential customers and will a attract a response.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|This multitool is well made and very practical<br />I've only used it a few times so far but it was great<br />Highly recommended
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|This was a lovely 'step back in time' read. I really enjoyed the way you were brought back in time. The author kept your interest throughtout while weaving a lovely story that kept me interested to the end.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|Storyline wasn't very clear and fight scenes were a bit slow as were the chase scenes on foot and in car Gina carano did good for her first movie but as an mma star I expected a little more she trains in muy thai and the choreographer did not show that side of her... overall I thought the movie was okay
B00000JCOV|5.0|I'm surprised people giving this CD 1 star?? Are you sure you are listening to the right music? I mean, if you like Slipknot, there is no possible way you gonna write a bad review about their debut. If you don't like nu-metal, then you can't say nothing, so stfu.<br />Back in the 2000's I was young a full of teenage euphoria, I borrowed this masterpiece from one of my friends from school and I made a cassete copy. I liked it so much that I ended buying the CD, well to make the story short, 12 years later and I still enjoy it a lot, I consider it a classic and one of the best of the genre.
B004SBQALA|5.0|The movie is pretty good and sticks to the book with a few exceptions, although nothing major is too different. I'm not sure if they're making movies for the other books, but I'd like them to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|runs great with no issues, I like the custom options. I give it 5 stars. I use it on my kindle fire.
0345803485|5.0|I have heard the rumors and gossip and had to see for myself, and I am ever so glad that I did. This is the first book/series in years that I have thrown myself into completely and truly have not been able to put it down. I finished the first 2 books in 2 1/2 days (I am waiting until after work tomorrow to pick up the 3rd!) and have passed them on to my family and friends. It's a beautiful, sexy, thrilling, emotional story and I have nothing but praises for it. Well done, Mrs James!
0718157834|5.0|I've been reading JoJo Moyes since I discovered her with SHIP OF BRIDES.  I've since bought every single one of her books, even though I've mostly had to order them from the U.K.  Moyes is one of my \\"must read\\" authors -- her books are always terrific stories filled with memorable characters -- the kind you'd like to know.  ME BEFORE YOU is no exception.  In fact, I'd say it's her best book yet.  Others have given a synopsis of the story, so I won't.  I'll just say that this is the kind of story you can't get out of your mind.  You will think about it and the issues it raises long after you've finished the last page.  You will also cry buckets of tears because Moyes knows how to push those emotional buttons. My only problem is Moyes is she doesn't write fast enough.  A year is simply too long to wait between books.  I can't wait till September now to read her newest.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The Avengers is the culmination of five previous movies and they could've easily screwed it up in so many different ways. Putting five disparate heroic characters from such different genres should've been a recipe for disaster. But somehow they manage to pull it off. And a large credit for that goes to Joss Whedon - an uber-comic fan who knew exactly what we wanted to see in the very first Superhero team-up film. All the predictable tropes of the comic books are here, but this is the first time we've ever seen them portrayed on film. The hero-on-hero fight, the team finally assembling and kicking superheroic butt all over New York. Great stuff.<br /><br />What makes The Avengers so different from recent blockbusters like Transfomers is that the emphasis is just as much on fleshing out the characters as on the entertaining action sequences. I can't recall any of Michael Bay's efforts having as much quotable dialogue as this film does (\\"Dost mother know, thoust wearest her drapes?\\", \\"Puny God\\"). Joss Whedon knows how to entertain an audience without insulting their intelligence, which is a tough act to pull off in most modern blockbuster films.<br /><br />I only have two minor criticisms - the 3D conversion and the lackluster soundtrack from Alan Silvestri. I believe the 3D was more the fault of the cinema - it looked muddy and flat, and I had a headache a few hours after watching it. The music sounded to me like sonic wallpaper for most of the film, but finally lifted at the end with a pretty rousing theme tune. It didn't doesn't sound like music from the same composer that did Captain America.<br /><br />I wish that I could recall one favourite moment, but the truth is that this entire film is one giant favourite moment. This is the ultimate superhero film I've been waiting to see since I was 12 years old and cracked open my first comic book. Joss Whedon, and the cast and crew, deserve credit for making one of the most entertaining blockbuster films I have seen in along, long time.<br /><br />I look forward to the Avengers assembling for the next film!
0143119680|5.0|I have never submitted a review of anything before and this book was so awesome that I had to share my thoughts.  The book is not a teenage fantasy but a grown-up fairy tale.  The characters are well-written and believable.  I cannot wait for the next book which is coming in July.
0307346609|5.0|I have read over a hundred zombie books, and even though this one is different from the norm, and written as if it were a historical account, it was brilliant in its execution.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Maps With Me is a fantastic app for using a digital map without requiring an internet connection. I used it recently on a business trip to supplement my driving directions. While I only have access to the free version (using on a Kindle Fire) the application still works great - I treat it as a replacement for my paper maps (having the ability to zoom in to a specific location and being able to read the street names easily is much preferred to folding out a big paper map taking up too much space). The app is missing exit numbers (for interstates and highways) but I'm confident that the creators will be adding this feature within a couple months. Also searching for addresses and possibly offline directions may be on the way as well.<br /><br />I give this app 5 stars for ease of use and the great detailed maps - Maps with me is not a GPS step-by-step directional system (at least not yet for Kindle Fire users) but simply a paper replacement - I recommend this for people for don't like to rely on always having an internet connection or always being connected to a satellite. Great app and I know it will get even better with time as it becomes more popular.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Stunning voice. I love this woman, her music, and her sound. Beautiful voice, good song choices, and quite a number of songs that will be lasting ones and never go out of vogue.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|This game looked promising but it did not work properly on my Toshiba Thrive.  One the very first screen, you are to \\"dial\\" a number.  This did not work properly.

1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall has written his best book so yet. He lays it all out clearly and supports it with research quotes and his personal experience with thousands of people over the past several decades. I can happily report that I have eaten this way for decades myself and have not been to a medical doctor since my discharge from the Marines in 1970. I attribute my ongoing outstanding vitality to a combination of my plant-based whole foods diet and daily vigorous primal movement. At 62 years of age I am stronger than ever.<br /><br />If you are looking to get all the essential details about how to eat well, feel great, and do it right I highly recommend this book.<br />Many of my clients sat down and read it cover to cover the day it came out.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Abolutely terrible, I never feel the desire of stop watching a movie, except for this one. I want my money back.
1609613937|5.0|I have been following Dr. McDougall for almost 2 years now. The Starch Solution is his best book yet, and I would highly recommend it. When I read other reviews criticizing it as a boring diet I have to laugh. Yes, compared to eating whatever you want to eat, it is very bland, but that is not the point. The point is that the foods we eat in the average american diet are killing us. In general we are fat and unhealthy, and Dr. McDougall is showing us how to reverse the damage done to our bodies. Fad diets do not work, and moderation doesn't work for most of us. The Starch Solution is radical, and calls for a lifestyle change that many are unwilling to make. I personally succeeded in weight loss and better health when following Dr. McDougall's guidelines about two years ago. I lost 55 pounds and felt great about myself. After going on a cruise I stopped exercising and went back to eating whatever I wanted. It took a year, but I gained back 40 of the 55 pounds I had lost. This book is going to be yet another chapter in my struggle to be healthy, but I believe this time I will do much better. The tools for your success are in the book, and though it may be tough, if you use them you will succeed. Where most diets will help you lose weight, Dr. McDougalls book shows you how to heal your ailments with diet alone. If you aren't willing to make a drastic change though, don't buy the book. If you are looking for a miracle that will cure you with no effort of your own, don't buy this book. If you are an overgrown child who can't take responsibility for his or her own life, don't buy this book. But, if you are someone who is ready to be healthy, and live a long productive life, buy the book now. If you are willing to make drastic changes, and receive drastic results, buy this book. If you are willing to exchange some of the things you like, for something much more fulfilling and gratifying, buy this book. The tools are here for you, they are just waiting to be used. I promiseyou, if you adopt Dr. McDougalls lifestyle changes, you will see great results.

B004GJDQT8|2.0|i recently purchased the droid bionic. 2 wks of having it the battery shorted out. after replacing battery my phone refused to get a signal. after verizon sent me a replacement phone which was refurbished and not new like the original with less of a warranty, i started to notice all the shortcomings of this phone. first, to download any app or even upgrade an existing one the phone requires you to use an outside wifi signal. secondly, the new battery doesn't last, only a few hours and less then when using the internet. when listening to music the battery last about 2 hours. take your charger with you! third, when you power the phone on sometimes it ewont except my pin to unlock to use. i could go on... with all the problems i had to call verizon dozens of times and although they are polite, they are not that helpful. when i went 3 wks without using their service the best they could knock off my first month bill ($125) was about $10. motorola? verizon? NEVER AGAIN!!! this will be a long two year commitment!!!
B00004Y87O|2.0|I've been a bit of a fan of Kurt Russel's movies for years now, but these movies have always seemed to escape my eyes until now. I thought I would finally check them out for what is considered to be one of Kurt Russel's biggest, if not, best role, according to a lot of people. I may have gone in with higher hopes then I should have, but after watching this movie, along with it's updated remake they passed off as a sequel (Escape from LA), it makes me wonder what so many are seeing in this movie that I just can not find.<br /><br />So the plot is, in 1997...pfft...don't ya just hate movies that laughably predict the future and get it all wrong? Why couldn't they just say \\"sometime in the future\\" and stop putting dates in movies, like \\"present day\\", for future generations of people to not straight away think, \\"oh, great, another 80's movie set in the future, which is already now the past and nothing like that ever happened\\"... anyway, in 1997, haha, New York has been transformed into a prisoner island... instead of jailing people in prisons, they now send them all to New York City island where it is surrounded by a prison fence on the shores of the mainland coastlines. Apparently no one has ever escaped. But now the United States president has accidentally dropped himself into New York, thanks to a terrorist attack on Air Force One that led to the president having to eject the plane in his 80's designed escape egg of the future. A rescue mission is designed for someone to go into New York and rescue the president and get him out within 24 hours to assure the documents he is carrying get to a peace summit to bring love and harmony to the world, or something like that. Of coarse, the government of the future fail with their rescue attempt (least they got that bit right about the future) and so now comes along the star of the movie Kurt Russel as Snake Plissken, rough and ready and looking like a teenage girls fantasy... if her fantasy is of a guy crossed between StephenNicols and Clint Eastwood on a bad day. Of coarse, it's up to Plissken to go in and save the day.<br /><br />What I don't get is what is the fascination with this movie? People consider it a cult classic? But I have to ask, why? It's not all that entertaining, the plot pieces and characters are laughable and I think Kurt did a better acting job in Captain Ron then he did in this movie. I do understand it was a first for Russel doing an action flick, and getting away from that pretty-boy Mickey Mouse club image he had a reputation for, but still, is it really worth more then 3 stars? What is it that makes the movie so good you would want to see it again, and again? I've seen it once now, and have no desire to ever see it again. I think there was more action in Tango & Cash and more excitement in Death Proof, let alone I even found Overboard to be a much funnier movie then this one. So can someone explain to me, what is it that is supposed to make this movie so damn good, because I didn't seem to catch any of it?
B0073XORCY|3.0|Dont know how you can consider this a Jethro Tull album. WHERE IS MARTIN!!! Are you kidding me a Jethro Tull album without Martin Barre is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and no jelly pretty dry if you get my meaning. I have been a loyal Tull Fan since 1968. I have every album they have recorded. I have attended at least 10 to 12 concerts.All of my daughters have grown up listening to Tull. My oldest is in her 40s and my youngest is in her 20s with another one in her 30s. We all set and down to listen to TAAB2 and were all disappointed. Ian did a good job of writing the music and played some of his finest flute playing in awhile. The band was tight and the vocals were well alright considering Ian has to struggle to hit the notes any more. But it just didnt have the Tull sound. It was a pretty good solo album for Ian, but by far not a Jethro Tull sound. Aftering waiting years for a new Tull album this one was a great disappointment. I sat and listened it 2 0r 3 more times and it just didn't get any better. I am sorry to say this one will collecy a lot of dust on it before it gets another listen. Dont know if it would have been better if Martin had played on it but i am sure it would have had a more Jethro Tull flavor and a little less Ian Anderson solo effert.I say get some of the members together who made Jethro Tull the great band that they were and crank out a album that most of us want to hear be done.  In other words better luck next time Ian................
1906735875|4.0|I read on line about a movie being made about this character and purchased the book to have an idea of who he was. Interesting stories, very detailed drawings. Not sure what kind of movie this will make but I'd recommend the book if you need some background info before seeing it.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|The foundation of this legal thriller is the drama of a family unraveling from the pressure and scrutiny of a murder indictment they can't escape regardless of what verdict gets returned. The story was refreshingly off-template from the usual legal drama and surprising to the end.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A MINI-SPOILER review for I've-seen-the-movie-but-haven't-read-the-book types. I'll be writing this review in the hopes you'll give the book a chance. What you've seen on-screen hasn't touched the surface. Here I am simply juxtaposing the movie VS the book.<br /><br />There are several movie fans out there who (like me) watched the movie first, and read the book soon after. Some of you have no intention on reading it because at this point (May 13th?) the trilogy may have been spoiled from you by others. It shouldn't deter you from reading such a masterpiece. The movie can stand alone by itself without reading the book. But just barely. The movie (while is does run 2 1/2 hours) simply doesn't have the time to explain what is going on. You'll spend too much time feeling clueless as to why X scene/character is significant. Simply put, it's too hard to get a feel of the characters, and understand their life experiences, and internal pain. You also forget to have sympathy for EVERY child involved in such a morbid scenario, and you may simply end up cheering for the underdogs. (A point that the movie completely undermines, and nearly misses it). The book is far more violent than the film.<br /><br />Now onto why you should read the book.<br /><br />First: Personality Development<br /><br />It is an in-depth view about class war, abuse of power, and the will to live from the street-smart, hardened-heart of 16-year old Katniss Everdeen as the protagonist in first person narrative. The book digs deeper into her psyche. What you may see on-screen is a withdrawn character who has eerily calm demeanor, under the circumstances of her fate. In the book Katniss is is witty, sharp, and takes on the role of the paternal provider of her family. [MINI-SPOILER ALERT] A role that is necessary, but she inwardly resents. (Only her grieving widowed mother, and younger sister, Primrose remain after their father was killed in a mine explosion when she was 11).[END MINI-SPOILER] She knows they can't survive without her, so she sharpens her hunting skills to survive off the land. Coming from the lowest ranked and least desired district 12, The coal industry, she is no stranger to hard knocks. She is profoundly mature for her age, and is not the bleeding-heart type. She can't afford to be. You will also learn more about Peeta, her counterpart and his role. What you may not see in the movie is that he is dually charismatic and self-deprecating. What he lacks in strategy he greatly makes up for in charm.<br /><br />As far as Gale is concerned there is less personality development than desired, but even less in the movie. He does show up more in Mockingjay. (The third installment). This early in the book, all we know is that she really opens up to Gale, her hunting partner and best friend. She clams up to everyone else, save Rue. Of all the main characters, Haymitch, Katniss' and Peeta's drunken mentor and previous winner from District 12 decades ago, is far more powerful and carries more weight as to why he's there. Effie Trinket, district twelve's Capitol representative and annual announcer for the games, is less two-dimensional than meets the eye. She does have compassion for her tributes, and even fears for them. She just insufferably communicates how she feels from a privileged point of view.<br /><br />Second, after seeing the movie, it really helps to put a face to what you've already seen. What I've written may or may not change your mind, at the very least putting emotions into other characters in the arena will. You will hurt for all of them, which is the book's intention.<br /><br />Get to know them. For a much better understanding. At this point, I am about 1/3 of the way through Mockingjay and will write reviews for all three books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I chose this book because everyone was reading it.  I usually read romance and mystery.  I have long been a reader of the basic story line of the supposedly bad boy that turns out to be good in the end and saves the heroine.  I'm definately not a prude and enjoy the sexual tension and love scenes.  BUT...(and I understand this is erotica, which I didn't in the beginning) There are so many sex scenes that it is almost terribly duplicative.  By the end of the book, I was skipping the scenes because the language was the same.  The descriptions were the same.  There was no feeling in this book. Well, to be exact there was no heart feeling, there was a lot of feeling in other ways.  I hoped the author would delve into the background more of the characters.  Mainly, Christian.  I could of summed up what we learned of Christian's background in 1 chapter.<br />I have read the other reviews and have to agree that the writing was not really very good.  I'm no writer but I felt this book lacked a real story other than very descriptive sex scenes.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Again, I say, Muse is amazing. Matthew Bellamy is uber talented and has a fabulous voice. I love listening to Muse.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|There are a lot of apps out there who could really stand to learn some things from the author of this one.  It works well, it's stable, it has a very clean presentation on the screen, and the ability to save snapshots of graph images as well as raw data (all of which can be downloaded with your USB cable) is a nice touch.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Who is more entitled to a little porn then us Mommies?  So What!  If it was kiddy porn, I'd have a problem with it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story after I got used to the \\"first person\\" voice.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the book, or are just curious about the genre, try SKYE MICHAELS, LECLUB SERIES on Amazon.  Calleigh's Collar and Kelly's Challenge.  I greatly enjoyed both of these even though the BDSM is on the light side.  The stories were good and the characters much more believable.
0439023513|5.0|Katniss never wanted to stand for something, everything she has done has been to protect a loved one, never did she dream of being the poster child of a Revolution. Now with Katniss out of the Arena for good and the war against President Snow raging on, Katniss has no choice but to be the symbol of hope for all twelve (er, thirteen) districts.<br /><br />The final installment to The Hunger Games and it does NOT disappoint. Not at all. While I thought that there would be more action than there was (you know...there being a Revolution going on and whatnot), emotions still flared and the death count continued to rise. Some deaths and actions downright took my breath away.<br /><br />We learn more about some of the characters, a lot more. This book nicely wraps up everyone's story (unless...you're Gale) and history. Along with further developing her characters, Collins introduces a new world, District 13. Besides all of the great characterization....something changed. By the end of the book I couldn't help but think \\"man, Katniss is a total bitch.\\" Which I still stand by. She makes some decisions that have me wanting to scream \\"no no no! this is madness\\" but! I understand. After all that Katniss and Peeta have gone through, it is safe to say that they are not the same people we met during the first Hunger Games. They have seen tragedy, they have killed, and all before they turn 18. Katniss is progression to instability is almost beautiful.... because it happens to subtly.<br /><br />I am still not Team Peeta or Team Gale, frankly I wouldn't have a problem is Katniss ended up alone, but I completely understand what Suzanne Collins did (well not the Gale part). Quite personally I'm a bigger fan of Finnick/Annie than I am Katniss/anybody.<br /><br />I think the writing is at its strongest here. Collins creates so many crazy twists and turns and accompanies them with beautiful songs. Collins really outdid herself, especially with the epilogue. The voice and so pained that it fits the story nicely.<br /><br />Mockingjay is an incredible conclusion with an amazingly comnplex female lead. If you're ready to cry your eyes out, read this book.t fits the story nicely.<br /><br />Mockingjay is an incredible conclusion with an amazingly comnplex female lead.

0486284735|4.0|I adore Elizabeth and the fact that she is headstrong and opinionated in this time when that was beyond frowned upon. I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:<br /><br />And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.<br /><br />My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?<br /><br />But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.<br /><br />Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions.is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions.
006197806X|4.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />In the sequel to Delirium, Lena is stronger than ever before, and ready to start loving again.<br /><br />Lena has spent several months in the Wilds. Months learning how to grow stronger and how to survive. And now she is ready to walk among the \\"Zombies\\" once again. On a special mission, Lena has to keep tabs on a pro-Cure group that is fighting to have the Cure required starting at a younger age. This organization is not the only thing that catches Lena's eye, she also can't seem to stay away from the founder's son, Julian.<br /><br />Hm. I wanted to like this book. I wanted to love this book. But....I don't. Like Delirium, there isn't a lot of action but a lot happens. Lena grows into her own person and soon she is ready to infiltrate New York under a new guise. The story is told from the past and the present until the past meets up with the present. This allows the reader to watch Lena's transformation.<br /><br />I was disappointed that none of the characters from Delirium were present in this book, I really wanted to see Lena's reaction to them after she discovered the true meaning of love. The characters that we are introduced to are just as strong and interesting though. We first meet the ever strong Raven who really pushes Lena to be all that she can be-and more. Their interactions were interesting and endearing; I think Raven was my favorite secondary character in this book. She is so head strong but also so vulnerable with the most heart-wrenching story.<br /><br />Now.....I have to address something that I wish I could ignore. Julian. He is the poster child for the pro-Cure group Lena is trying to destroy from the inside. As fate would have it, they fall in love and their relationship starts to mirror that of Alex and Lena. Now because I know and love Alex I cannot accept the possibility of another boy who can hold a light to him. Because Alex and perfect. And the story seems to hint at a future love triangle which...I could definitely do without. So that's really all I have to say. It's upsetting to write about.<br /><br />The writing is akin to poetry. Oliver describes everything beautifully and romantically. Lena's first person point of view helps show her progression into a strong and independent woman who is taking the role of her first love.<br /><br />Pandemonium is not what I was expecting but Oliver never fails to create a beautiful story. I am curious to see how this will all end.ly do without. So that's really all I have to say. It's upsetting to write about.<br /><br />The writing is akin to poetry.

0439023513|4.0|The book is so amazing that it left me speechless.<br /><br />It is really beyond words, but I will try to sum it up for you.<br /><br />This is the final installment in the Hunger Games series and it follows Katniss in a battle against the Capitol.  At the end of Catching Fire, Katniss and Peeta were separated and District 12 was destroyed.  You soon learn that the rebellion saved Katniss but didn't get to Peeta in time so he is now being held captive by the Capitol.  The rebels are now using Katniss as their public figure head and make her shoot small campaign ads to encourage people to join the revolution.  That is all I can really say without spoiling anything.<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering why, if I think it is beyond amazing, did I only give it 4 stars?<br />Because this book has too much death for my liking.  I get that the people in this book are at war and that means causalities but that doesn't mean I condone killing people I love.<br /><br />I loved the character development in this.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED reading more about Finnick, seeing his past and just more of him in general.  &lt;3&lt;3 If you loved the first two books in this series then you'll definitely love this one.  Despite the excessive death, this book does have a happily ever after and Katniss ends up with the man of her choice.
0439023491|4.0|After touring all twelve districts with co-victor Peeta, the two realize that the districts are not as controlled as the Capitol makes them think they are. There are riots, escapees and somehow Katniss has become the face of the Revolution. In an attempt to squash the Revolution for once and for good, he sends Katniss back into the arena, in hopes that she won't come back.<br /><br />This book picks up right where The Hunger Games left off. Katniss and Peeta are preparing to tour the districts as victors of the 74th Hunger Games while dealing with their personal demons. The story flows well with Katniss are narrator and more of the Districts being revealed. When I first read the book, I was kind of annoyed to find out that Suzanne Collins was throwing Katniss, Peeta and ten other tributes back into the Arena; it felt kind of cheap. Upon reflection, I LOVE how it was handled (one line that comes to mind is, \\"there is no room for a Girl on Fire) and I loved the set-up of this Arena. I think I liked this arena more than the one of the 74th Hunger Games. I also liked that Katniss gave the audience a history of The Hunger Games which helped her understand her new enemies, as well as our beloved Haymitch. What made Catching Fire so memorable are the introduction to new characters.<br /><br />Finnick. Joanna. They are awesome and I am so happy that Collins created them. With the start of a new Hunger Games, comes new tributes and Game Masters. I felt more connected to these tributes (well...besides Rue and Thresh obviously) than I did for the previous book's tributes (there is a scene with a District 6 tribute that had me BAWLING). Katniss is still a strong heroine fighting a battle she didn't sign up for, Peeta is....there, we find out more about Gale, and we are given clues regarding President Snow's past. I also adored Madge, the old lady with a mean hook...literally.<br /><br />I still love Katniss's point of view. She is so strong, so committed to helping others, and she is so REAL. Everythign Katniss feels, the reader feels, there is never a moment where Katniss knows more than the reader which I love. Suzanne Collins writing is still fabulous and un-put-down-able.<br /><br />Overall, Catching Fire is a strong follow up to The Hunger Games and anyone who was a fan of the initial book will definitely love this one!she is so REAL.

0439023491|5.0|Can you summarize the plot?<br />Without spoilers? No, I cannot. But here is my best attempt: Katniss & Peeta have returned to District 12 and are about to embark on a tour of the districts.  Katniss gets threatened by President Snow because apparently her \\"stunt\\" caused a rising rebellion which we all know was probably already in effect but he wants a scapegoat to blame it on.  Katniss, of course, agrees to do anything to protect her family but also only makes things worse.  There, that's it.  I can't really say more without giving away spoilers.<br /><br />What were your initial thoughts going into the book?<br />To put it simply, OMFG! Yay for The Hunger Games 2!  Katniss! Stop being an idiot and just be with Peeta already!<br /><br />What were your initial thoughts after finishing the novel?<br />Cliffhanger!  Cliffhanger! Danger! Danger! Seriously, those were my initial thoughts, along with a giant urge to start the next book IMMEDIATELY.  You want more than that? Um....obviously I was just as impressed with this novel as I was with the first, if not more so.  If you have read The Hunger Games, expect this to be a lot like it but a little more complicated and move love triangle-y.<br />Gale? Peeta? Peeta? Gale? I know who I'd choose, but Katniss can't make up her damn mind.  Sorry, love triangles are a pet peeve of mine.  I really don't like girls who truthfully try to claim they are in love with 2 different guys.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.  I think you can love many people as well as be attracted to a lot of people, but only be in love with one at a time.  Either you really are in love with one of them and are just lusting after the other or you don't truly love either.  Maybe I am wrong, but still I hate it.<br /><br />What did you like about this book?<br />I love the plot twists.  There were several things I saw coming but there was a lot that I didn't.  I loved the character development.  You can really see a lot of the characters grow.<br /><br />What did you dislike about this book?<br />Sorry to sound like a broken record, but the love triangle.  I think that might have been my only issue, so bravo Ms. Collins<br /><br />Who was your favorite character?<br />It is still Peeta, but I fell in love with Finnick by the end.  Seriously, he is awesome.<br /><br />Does it have a love triangle?<br />I really need to just remove this question, don't know I? Yes it does, please refer to the \\"what were your initial thoughts\\" question.<br />Does it have a cliffhanger ending?<br />Yep.  A pretty bad one at that, so if you don't like cliffhangers, I advise you to have Mockingjay on hand when you finish this so you can go ahead and start it.<br /><br />Closing thoughts?<br />All in all, this was an amazing book.  There are a lot of YA trilogies where the first book is amazing and the second one is a big disappointment, but this isn't one of them.  The story flows well and I just couldn't put it down.  I ended sneaking and reading this in school when I should have been doing classwork.at did you dislike about this book?<br />Sorry to sound like a broken record, but the love triangle.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|a good time killer an easy to play and very entertaining and great game for free a little lagy though
0439023521|5.0|Can you summarize the plot?<br />This book is the first in the Hunger Games series, and it follows Katniss Everdeen on her journey to try to win the hunger games.  The hunger games is a contest held every year in which 2 people (a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18) is chosen to compete in a fight to the death for the entertainment of the rest of the Panem society.  That's as basic as I can put it.<br /><br />What were your initial thoughts going into the book?<br />I was a little scared that I might hate it.  Despite having read many (many, many, many, many) amazing reviews on this book and truly wanting to see the film, I was scared the writing would be too dull or horrific to hold my attention.  I also have a penchant for good endings and well, with a summery like the one above, you know a lot of people are going to die and I wasn't sure if I would be pleased with that.<br /><br />What were your initial thoughts after finishing the novel?<br />I was a bit speechless.  I loved it.  Honestly, I really do like reading a bit of gore, it just makes happy endings hard to come by.  I genuinely love Peeta (yeah, I am definitely team Peeta) and I wanted to see where their relationship went.  This book drew me in pretty quickly and it was hard to put down.<br /><br />What did you like about this book?<br />I liked that it was written in first person because I really liked Katniss' no nonsense way of narrating.  I loved most of the characters ::coughs:: especially Peeta ::clears thoat:: The world it is set in is so different and excited and I just needed to know more and more about it.  I am a bit of an sucker for dystopian novels right now.  I also really loved the gore and the way Suzanne Collins didn't shy away from that or make it too easy on Katniss.  She gets serious injuries and has to really fight to stay alive.<br /><br />What did you dislike about this book?<br />I didn't like the love triangle.  This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine because almost every YA novel right now has a love triangle and I hate it.  I hate it for several reasons, but one of the main ones is that it takes a male character (because it is always one girl between two guys) that I could adore and makes me dislike him for trying to break up the main love interest which I typically like.  It also makes the heroine seem...um...Bella-esque?  It gives them that quality that Bella Swan had where she feels ridiculously unattractive but every guy hits on her. Stupid, I guess would be the only word coming to mind that comes close.  If you have a better word, please comment and let me know.  Regardless, Katniss is anything but stupid so I hate that she was given that quality.<br /><br />Who was your favorite character?<br />Oooo...hard one....::thinks:: oh yeah, PEETA! I also really love Caesar Flickerman.<br /><br />Does it have a love triangle?<br />...whoops, please refer to the \\"What do you dislike about this book\\" question.<br /><br />Does it have a cliffhanger ending?<br />Yes, but not a massive one.  It is one of those small cliffhangers you can deal with.<br /><br />Closing thoughts?<br />Just one: I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE!

1419702238|3.0|first of all the other books of the series were very funny.. they kept me reading and i would NOT put the book down!!!! but i cant say the same thing with this one... this book was still funny and interesting... but it just wasn't as funny as the other books... i was kinda disappointed when i finished the book cuz i was REALLY looking forward to it!!! i'm VERY picky with books... diary of a wimpy kid was the ONLY book series that i would read for fun! this book is worth it if you laugh easily... but if you're picky like me you might wanna pass on this one and read some of the others.

B005AVIZ6U|5.0|You either like the Lee Child character of Jack Reacher or you don't, there really is no middle ground.  And can I just say at the outset, just to get it out of the way, Tom Cruise buying and starring in the movie franchise doesn't matter a jot.  A book is a book is a book, that sometimes gets made into a movie and generally the movie is well below the standard of the book, so people get over it and concentrate on the books and stop bloody whingeing!<br /><br />Jack Reacher has been wandering around small time America for a couple of years now doing his best to wear out the tarmac of the roads leading into the middle of nowhere, arriving nowhere and finding the locals being bullied. Reacher doesn't like bullies and generally takes on the baddies in defence of the defenceless and cowered locals and he does it so magnificently and with so little effort, that we keep following him around from nowhere to nowhere, stopping occasionally to buy a new shirt and pair of pants; well when your walking and covering the miles that he does the last thing you need as an encumbrance, is a suitcase full of clothes.<br /><br />The Affair takes us back to 1997 when Reacher was still a Major in the Army as an  MP and takes us back to the final case he worked on, before taking up his peripatetic wanderings through small town America.<br /><br />1997 and Reacher is called to his boss, Leon Garbers, office. A woman has been Raped, killed and mutilated, her throat slit near an Army base in Carter Crossing, Mississippi.  Reacher is despatched undercover to get close to the local police while another MP investigates the Army side of things at Fort Kelham.  Sent off with half a story and finding that the local Sheriff is an ex Marine MP, Reacher discovers that there has been more than one murder and in fact there have been possible other murders elsewhere that can be linked to the local ones.  The nature of Army bases is that they can have followers who move around Army bases  setting up wherever they are, so they have no idea whether it is a civilian killer or an Army killer, but the underlying message is, 'that the good name of the Army, must be protected!'<br /><br />As usual Reacher gets to the truth and all questions raised in the story are conclusively answered in the closing pages, including just why Reacher decided it was time to hang up his uniform.<br /><br />Disillusioned with the Army at the same time that it was downsizing, a less than stellar report from an Army Colonel on his attitude and tactics which would have seen him marking time career wise.  The blackening of innocent peoples reputations by politicians, and the Army, these were all the things that were vaguely referred to in previous story lines, and going back to 1997 gave us the story behind the myth that is Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Reacher is a killer, but a killer with scruples and a sense of what is morally right and what is not.  He knows that not everyone on the planet is capable of looking after themselves either physically or by engaging the law, and so he is prepared to look out for their interests.  Killing will never be right, but when it is done out of a clear sense of justice that the normal course of the law would not get to, whether it be for a cover up, or lazy and useless police work , he can easily become, judge, jury and executioner , even when it is the Army, Federal or Local  Government, or just pure criminality; he will take them all on....... and I will be there again, when Reacher arrives at the next small 'nowhere' town.<br /><br />Editing for Kindle /iPad: 5 out of 5<br />Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5<br />Page length on kindle /iPad: 405<br />Plot: 5 out of 5<br />Overall Rating: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Lee Child / Jack Reacher can be found here<br /><br />Footnote:  I love my Kindle but I do wish they would take a leaf out of the Kindle App for iPad and show the book tile and Authors name on each page and more importantly, show the page number as it doeswhen reading through the Kindle iPad app, just saying.<br /><br />Other reviews and comments on things literary can be found at tomstronach.blogspot.com (Is It Me)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I love Wool! I'm not a huge sci fi reader, but I'm a rabid King fan, lots of older Koontz and Rice (both of whom have disappointed me of late) and was looking for a new author to follow.  I took a chance and purchased the Wool Omnibus on my Kindle after reading the great reviews, and I am SO glad I did.  This is a great story.  The world Hugh has created in his silos is fascinating and I truly cared about the characters.  I was so excited to see \\"First Shift\\" Part 6, and purchased it immediately.  My only complaint. . .they are not long enough, lol.  I tend to love those 500 pagers (if it's a good book) and I really hated reaching the end of the story.  Keep them coming, Mr. Howey!

B000002JKA|5.0|The songs on Awake are so good that they only range from great to holy Moses that song was freakin' unbelievable.  Every single track on the album is great.  Awake is far better than anything Metallica ever put out.  The musicianship is phenomenal.  The production is superb.  Realistically, I have tried to think of some constructive criticisms for this album, but I fail.  It just simply doesn't get any better than this.<br />Every musician is playing a well crafted piece of music.  If you a guitarist, then you will be blown away by John.  If you are a vocalist you will be blow away by James.  If you a drummer you will be blown away by Mike Portnoy, and so on...<br />I have all of Dream Theater's albums, and this is definitely one of their personal best, and Dream Theater is already among the best at making music today.  My other favorites in the Dream Theater catalog are Octavarium, Score, Systematic Chaos, and A Dramatic Turn of Events.<br />Awake was actually my first ever Dream Theater purchase.  Prior to this I had only heard Pull Me Under on the radio in the wee hours of the morning on a radio show that specialized in metal.  The show was on so late that when I was a kid, I used to wait for it to come on, pop a cassette tape in my boom box and record the show for later listening.  I liked that song, so when I got to college, and someone was like, \\"Hey!  Dream Theater is a really good progressive metal band, you should check them out,\\" and I was like hmmm, I remember that song, \\"Pull Me Under,\\" I heard on the radio, so I rushed out and bought Awake.  Getting into Dream Theater has literally changed my life because I have spend so much time listening to their songs.<br />In my opinion, the songs on Awake are better than Pull Me Under, and they outdid their first major label  effort, \\"Images and Words.\\"  Pull Me Under Sounds like Metallica with a different vocalist to me.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am not a reader. So one novel usually takes me a whole year when I feel like reading to get through it, if I decided to get that far in the book. THIS book is for ADULTS only. I am usually not a romance novel girl but this is so deep and descriptive (not just intimate scenes) that it kept my attention and will keep yours too. There is drama and a lot of it. Its not the hardest read but each book picks up where the previous one is and the author does a really good job of not halfassing the last two books. They are as strong as the first. I appreciate that. Also she finishes all ties which to me is a hard thing for an author to go back and do all the time. If you are a woman who is adult enough to handle some intimacy but also likes a good read then you will like these. I read this trilogy in less then 1 month.
B005FISC52|5.0|One Tree Hill the Ninth Season was worth the wait, but it's over, and I wish there were more seasons to watch.  Like how the children of the charaters grew up like Jaime, and if you were going to bring back Lucas. What is his daughter going to be like and what about his sister, what is she like.  There are lots of things that could happen but we will never know.<br />I enjoyed the whole 9 seasons.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|This item was given to me as a gift without any knowledge of the show (other than the actors)I was very unsure. I ended up watching the entire season in about 4 days and quickly purchased season two. Very smart and creative. The movie themed episodes are fantastic. Joel McHale is very convincing in his role, Chevy Chase is at his best, Ken Joeng and Jim Rash are very funny, Alison Brie, Danny Pudi and Donald Glover are show-stealers and Gillian Jacobs and Yvette Nicole Brown round out the cast nicely. This show is without a doubt one of the best and most underated sitcoms on tv today.
0439023491|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had lots of unexpected plot twists. If you liked the first book, I highly recommend you read the second one.
0345803485|5.0|First I have to say I am not one to read books, but I was intrigued by the banning in libraries. I read this book in 3 days, I ordered the other 2 books before I was finished. When the first book ended, I was too impatient to wait on my books to get here and ordered the second book for kindle in my iphone. I read that one in one day on my day off. I can not wait for book 3 to arrive today. I love these books and hope  E.L. James continues to write. The story was captivating along with the erotic scenes. My husband is not complaining either and even wants to read them to find out what has actually peaked my interest in reading and made things more interesting.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Saw this movie opening weekend... twice! The last time I walked out of a movie thinking I just HAD to go back to see it again was in 2005 when I saw Firefly, another Joss Whedon creation (only much more his own and catering to a much smaller audience) and before that in 1999 when I saw The Matrix.  The Avengers was just much so fun that built on the six movies that came before and led up to it.  Amazing to see all these characters juggled so well in a film that balanced action with wit and science as well as comic and mythological legend.  Thought about it so much during the week that I saw it again the following weekend and plan on going next weekend, too.  Such awesome fun!!

0307956350|3.0|I've never read a spy novel before, for the record, so I don't know how this compares to others in that genre. While this book kept me reading, and I like books with tons of dialogue, a lot of the actions of the main character were just bizarre. She is suspicious of her husband and of other main characters, and instead of acting to keep distance between her and the other characters, she just endures being in their company, over and over. Later in the novel (I try very hard to avoid spoilers), she acts like she actually cared about the others. She has NO reason to care about them, and frankly I'd have been quite ticked at the husband, too. I also don't know why she forced herself to do the housewife-abroad thing she talks about and hates. It's like she had no mind of her own once she quit work.

0439023513|3.0|I don't know about these books. On the one hand, I devoured the whole trilogy in a week, but on the other, that doesn't necessarily mean I enjoyed the whole ride. I guess I kept waiting for the Girl who was on fire to, I don't know, really be on fire. Not in a literal sense, that would just be mean, but along the way I kept hoping to see this main character that got so many people excited. I suppose I did, in parts. Mostly it just seemed like she was along for the ride, always getting caught up in everyone else's schemes. It was alright for the first book, and maybe some of the second, but by the third I was very disappointed.<br /><br />  Katniss seemed to take on the role of her distraught mother all those years ago, the very thing she hated the most, or so I thought, helpless and depressed. Yes, I'm sure her life has been hard, but she had pulled through before, stepped up when her father died, so now I am supposed to believe that she melted into a mess of a puddle over some boy she met in the last games? Uh, alright. She spent most of the third book running away and, drugged up in the hospital, doing boring and silly propaganda videos, and getting into so much unnecessary trouble that I started to wonder why anyone would want to pick her as the Mockingjay. She never really had a desire, at least to me, to bring down the Capital. I kept waiting for her to say, or to at least realize, that the revolution would free thousands and make life better for everyone, but in the end it always came down to Peeta, or another tribute she hardly knew. It is war. It is terrible, we all know this. She should have known that before ever agreeing to be their symbol. In fact, I am surprised that anyone growing up watching a terrible thing such as the Hunger Games could really be that sensitive to death.<br /><br />  Having them go back into the arena in the second book felt like a cop out. (Though I must say that arena was pretty clever and interesting to read at least.) The wholeplot at the end of the third book where Katniss wants to kill President Snow was useless, she never achieves her goal and the people that died did in vain. I hope she at least apologized to Anne and her newborn son for that. I could see the death of Coin coming from a mile away, though it would have been nice for the author to clear up Katniss' reasoning for it, instead she just simply does, doing exactly what Snow wanted. Then she doesn't try to stick up for herself on why she did, she's just sent to a room where she contemplates suicide, a great message to send I suppose.<br /><br />  Then she is sent away, back to the edge of their world where no one has to see her ever again, not even her mother- which face it was a throw away character to begin with- or her supposed best friend/ other love interest. It's there that she truly transforms into her mother, becoming a useless lump. Never wanting to use her power to make sure another President Snow or Coin would get elected. I suppose maybe she becomes happy, eventually, but that is also unclear seeing as how Peeta had to beg her for years to have children, and even then it didn't seem like it was truly her choice to do so. I don't expect a happy ending, in fact it's rather refreshing that it isn't, but at least make it useful and true to the characters. She spends so much time beating down her readers, that it would have been nice to know there is some ray of hope at the end, especially seeing that Peeta finally becomes himself, or mostly himself anyways.<br /><br />  At the end, we never really know what becomes of the government, or the capital or many of the districts. Does it become free? Or does it return to the totalitarian rule that it once was? What about the rest of the world? Is Panem, or however you spell it, really the only human civilization left?<br /><br />  That's why I just don't know about these books. I feel like they would have been much better if they weren't written for the Young Adult market,if they were allowed to delve deeper into the more disturbing themes like the excess of the government at the others expense, the death of children, how far people would be willing to go to fight for what's right, etc, instead of the supposed love triangle I really felt nothing about. They are good books and definitely worth the read, though I'm not sure they are worth all the hype surrounding them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't get enough of the first 2 books; I sacrificed sleep and a little housework to complete them!  The 3rd book was soooo good but I made myself slow down and enjoy each moment of it.  It was nearly bittersweet because I fell in love with the characters and knew the the \\"ending\\" was looming.  I will read anything that EL James writes regarding these fascinating characters!  I hope there is more to come.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Bought the boxed trilogy 3 pack.  It was delivered when promised and the quality was excellent.  Who would have thought the old '80s' Hasbro toys and kids show would have evolved into this?
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This was a good read for me.  I enjoyed Travis; the \\"bad\\" boy.  It was a relatable story and that caught my attention from the first page.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|This movie has a lot of attractive guys in it, but seriously... It seems way too stagey and costumey, and like the actors are obviously acting, and not very well, either.<br /><br />They way the \\"important\\" characters make big speeches every five minutes threatening someone with castration or whatever, trying to sound all deeply ominous and epic, it's just laughable.<br /><br />Lame movie, overall. If you're looking for something like Kingdom of Heaven or Braveheart or the recent Robin Hood, this movie is all wrong.<br /><br />It's \\"serious\\" but only in the way it takes itself WAY too seriously, and not because it's any good, or has any kind of non stupid story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the paperback version of this book and borrowed it from a friend.  After reading the trilogy I was inspired to purchase a kindle!  I have always enjoyed reading but set it aside for the past few years; since I had my Son.  These books tapped into my imagination and made me long to read and discover again.  I feel like I know these characters so well now and can not wait for a movie.  I believe it can be done tastefully and hope that the relationship can be portrayed as captivating as the book!
B001NESPHC|5.0|I love her voice and every track on this album, very romantic and soulful, I have recommended to many friends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've had a discussion with most of my friends who have read the trilogy and everyone loves this book the most.  I felt it necessary for the story but the whole trilogy was captivating.  I love the layers of the fascinating characters.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I liked it at first but its become boring after a while. Worth playing only if you have a lot of time to devote.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|We follow the narrator Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint who tells the tale of how criminal mastermind, Keyser Soze, is not only real but lured him and four of his criminal friends into a job that left multiple dead bodies and an explosion in New York harbor. This movie had me hooked from the beginning, the script knows how to balance drama with comedy and even has a pretty dam good cast. I was just blown away and how, throughout the movie, I was questioning who exactly Keyser Soze was and was very interested in his backstory and mythical reputation. This film delivers on cast,writing,and even special effects. This movie also does a great job of explaining each character and their motivations for doing what it is they do. I can't stress this enough,find a copy of this movie and enjoy.
B004S82OAE|1.0|Bought this e-book for kindle and started reading it, I was interested in the additional course material which was available from the author's website.<br /><br />While I was on the author's website I found a big complaint from other readers, mainly that the material has errors and is out of date - the author confirmed that Sybex have not updated the e-book version, and only the physical copy.<br /><br />It's a shame too, it seemed like a good book.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Installed it. Couldn't find Grand Cayman. Cant find my city, nearby cities, or the country. Guess the devolopers think the world ends at the US borders.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Outstanding adaptation of the book.  The last part is a bit melodramatic, but still first rate.  Highly recommended for any history nuts.
0312945973|5.0|Wilbur Smith employs all of his trademark literary tricks to make River God one of his best books ever. Combining powerful writing, great story line, strong characters, evil villains, sex, beauty and violence with a detailed look at life along the Nile with mighty Pharaoh, Smith pays fitting tribute to ancient Egypt. At the center of the story is the wily, egotistical eunuch and slave Taita. Using his wits and intelligence to survive, and loyally protect the ones he loves, Taita is as unique a hero as readers will find. And also one of the most unforgettable.<br />This book is a great read, whether it is your first time through, or like me, you picked it up again to enjoy for the third time.<br />River God is a true classic. And while the sequel \\"Warlock\\" uses a different writing style, that book is also wonderful.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate. I rely on this app daily. I really like how you can have multiple cities saved on the device.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved  this series read it i less than a week, did not want to put it down. I have recommended this to all my girlfriends and even my mother to read. I cant wait for Jones to write more books.
0316174483|5.0|Ed Emberley's Complete Fun Print Drawing book is great for creating kid's art.  My son loves it and has made birthday cards, artwork for his room and presents for family.  He loves getting his fingers on the ink pad and drawing in the details.  It's fun, simple and engaging.  You'll want a couple of different colors of ink pads, a black pen and baby wipes to clean their fingers - all very simple supplies.  I enjoyed making some of the artwork right along with my son.
B0000029GA|5.0|If your a fan of hip hop then you already own this album or atleast heard it before. This is Nas at his best, nothing but classic beats and classic rhymes ! No song on here is worth skipping, its a must listen. Az is the only artist featured on here and he kills it on \\"Life's A B\\", even though I love the whole cd my personal fav track is \\"Memory Lane\\" with the dope sample and the way Nas just goes in is ridiculous. With production from Preemo, Pete Rock, L.E.S & Large Pro what more could you ask more? Its a must have, Classic 5/5
0345803485|5.0|Oh. My. God. I am riveted. So much so that TWICE I've missed my stop because I was so engrossed in the story. Do yourself a favor, order the whole trilogy, waiting for the next book to arrive is killing me!!
0307450570|4.0|I really liked this book. I just found that a lot of the projects I had seen them already at the Martha's website. But over all it is very good and BIG! :)
0439023491|4.0|At first I was off put by the violent nature of this book series, but I was quickly drawn into the story and forgot all about my moral objections. The story is quick moving and well written. I just wished for a different ending.
B0000021RD|5.0|this is the original CD that was released by Columbia in 1995.  aside from being a great album, the earlier Columbia CDs just sound better to my ears than the later Rhino re-issues.  so if you still have one of these, don't throw it away.  I have a feeling I'm not the only one who thinks this, and the prices for used copies keep going up.
B00729GQ0A|3.0|This book's plot was good and I like the characters, but there were several time line problems.  Also there is no way to fly from the United States to Europe in 3 hours unless you are inside some type of super jet.  If that is the case then some background detail on the technology needed to be provided.  The theme has potential, but more location and character development is needed.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I watched it through netflix after watching season 1.  This prequel introduced characters that were just as fascinating as the ones in season 1.  I have sinced checked it out of the library and now have decided to purchase it.  If you liked season 1, you will like this.  The character, Gannicus, was wonderful and worth watching several times.  I look forward to season 2 which includes Spartacus and Gannicus.
0345803485|5.0|Wow alot of you must not be able to EVER  step out of your box and let your hair down. THIS IS ONE OS THE BEST BOOKS i have read in a long time to help me relax and foreget about all the bs we all encounter. Lighten up your panties folks if soft porn that leads into a good thing does not interest you than dont read the books. Last time I looked ...still a free country. I found these books freeing. I have a husband who comes from a family of alcoholics with a bad family life and for me I found positive in this book. All that Christian came from and encountered and then opened his heart to ana... awesome. And together they encounter their life trying not to shut each other out. All over the board with this one... leaves me wondering what can live up to this trilogy......
630463949X|5.0|Nothing says soft rock like Fleetwood Mac, but this DVD brings the pain to anyone that enjoys their music. Ive spent 20 bucks on stuff way dumber and way more useless than this dvd I can promise you that !
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game...recommended highly by me for fun!!  Helps me relax and wind down.  This game is challenging also for Solitaire Lover's.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a Simply fun and addictive game. A Nice spin on a classic card game. And Very Easy to learn.
0345803485|2.0|\\"Fanfics are just amateur writings; spin offs of Edward and Bella. 50 Shades of Grey is a fanfic named Master of the Universe (MOTU). If you look, you can find the pdf version of the fanfic for free with the actual twi names. She had to change the names to be published. EL James just happened to have the right connections by knowing people in the industry to get published. She gives BDSM a bad rep, not to mention her lack of writing of skills. The fan fiction world is not happy and rightly so.<br /><br />If you'd like to read real BDSM books by authors who know how to write and work hard, I suggest these authors: Annabel Joseph ([...]), Maya Banks, Fallon Blake, Anneke Jacob, and Molly Weatherfield.<br /><br />I do not support this author nor her plagiarism from true BDSM books by using scenes from other books.\\"
B000FBJF3M|1.0|I read this in part because of the favorable reviews and after finishing the book I have to wonder what the favorable reviewers read. The book is composed of two or three barely related stories. The first is about a young roman water way specialist as he works to restore water to a town. The second and least important story is how the young engineer developes affection toward the daughter of a villain, and the third involves the destruction of Pompeii as a result of Mt Vesuvius's eruption.<br /><br />None of the stories was especially engaging and I could have set the book aside at any time as the story and it's ending were completely predictable.
B004LUS390|5.0|someone said this is not compatible with the fire, but that what i use it one. I think its because I never do any of the updates. ....lol good thing i dont do them.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I bought this album for the song \\"Somebody that I used to know\\", but found I loved all the music on the album!!  Very inspiring music and just plain fun to listen to!
B007P3TMW2|3.0|I found this film hard to follow.  It could be that the reception from Amazon streaming was poor so I had pauses intermittantly.  I may watch it again to see if I like it but will wait until it is on a premimum channel.
B0000DYKET|5.0|After having owned a pair of Keen shoes which I really liked, a friend who owned a pair of the sandals (as well as Keen shoes) highly recommended these.<br /><br />These are the second-most comfortable pair of footwear I have ever worn. I have been on the hunt for comfortable shoes for years, my feet fatigue quickly and most shoes or inserts have done nothing to help. I thought I loved my Keen shoes until I got a pair of these. I won't wear any other brand of shoes ever again, the search is over.<br /><br />The most comfortable shoes ever are the Keen Howsers. But they are more for lounging/house and short trips to the store. And only for colder areas/seasons. For an all-around shoe, the Newports are king. I also own the Newport H2 sandals for more activity-based stuff like biking, walks, hiking, canoeing and such. They are far more water-resistant, but not as comfortable. I like owning both styles, one for doing stuff, another as my \\"shoes\\". I wish Keen made a shoe version of these sandals.<br /><br />Pricey? Not for how great these sandals are. Think of it as an investment. You'll love them so much you won't ever think about the price again.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Fabulous book, keeps the reader entertained at all times.  Could not read fast enough.<br />This is a great book club selection.
0385495323|5.0|I wish my applied math courses could have had a primer written like this book, because it makes you want to discover more on the subject.  Gentle introduction to concepts that builds to clear understanding of some difficult ideas that are used everywhere in today's computer-based society.  I especially enjoyed the chapters on Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA cryptography, and the chapter on the decipherment of Linear B was fascinating.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great without any problems. good looking interface and very responsive. I would recommend this app for anyone looking for a good weather forecast program

0061537969|5.0|I don't read a lot but going through rectal and lung cancer,one of my doctors recommended it.  It made me laugh, cry and also give me strength to know that life is short.  Love, laugh, enjoy yourself and keep strong.  I have passed my book to a girlfriend who also enjoyed the book.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  Easy reading.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I just got this game and its pretty awesome I love and it was free! wish I found this game a while ago
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I liked the movie because the protagonist does her own stunts. It is also entertaining and nice to the eye.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are really fun. others are not or are hard to control. but overall I enjoy playing them. Its pretty good variety and its free!
3833160454|5.0|Nice read, very informative.  It is a nice overview of how shoes are made.  It's too vague, to be useful if your thinking about making your own shoes.  Not a \\"How to book\\"
B004SOR4H6|5.0|yes this a very awesome app because I can use it for everything and don't have to type it!!!!!!!!! works fantastic on kindle fire
B0055PGUYU|1.0|I rated this book very low, not because of content, but because of cost and restrictions.  The Kindle edition cost nearly as much as the hardback printed version and I am not allowed to loan the book.  So why did I buy it?  I am a new Kindle user and am learning the ropes.  Won't get caught in that scam again.  As far as the book goes, it was an interesting study and gave good insights into habits.  I especially liked the first half of the book.  After that, it went a bit astray.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Issues with collecting money.  I have been told that IF the money is lost, the food goes back on counter.  However, even with extensive team lava support contact, I have found this to be false in many cases.  It. DOES happen at times though.  It is just frustrating as baking and decorating require money.<br /><br />Another issue.  It seems as if the items to buy (to decorate) change from coins (free) to gems (bought).  So, ya can start decorating a certain way and then be thwarted when changes to gems to buy.  So, you have to start over with decorating.  Of course, I should mention, gems can be earned with achievements.  But, not in enough quantity to really amount to much.<br /><br />There IS a parental control setting that can assist those NOT wanting a child to REALLY buy gems.<br /><br />Even with the issues...I LOVE the game and play daily.  I just cannot give it 5 * as the issues are not minor.<br /><br />****THIS REVIEW IS SAME AS FOR BAKERY AS SAME ISSUES APPLY****<br /><br />Christine
B005Z28M58|3.0|This last and finale season picks up where season seven left us; on a rollercoaster ride of emotion and surprises.  Newcomers on Wisteria Lane are intriguing and have loads of charisma to sell, especially Charles Mesure as Ben.  What a presence! Season five and season six were, to me, of lesser quality. Although I've always remained a fan, I thought that the episodes were starting to become caricatures of themselves.  I even went as far as to regret that they didn't end the show at the end of season four, with that original and perfect ending showing us the characters five years older. In a way, I still think that it was the perfect way to say goodbye. Even though I love Marc Cherry's creation, I think he stretched it a bit too far. But if you could go back in time and adjust some things, I'd take season five, six, seven and eight and morph them into one big, incredible single season and make it the ultimate season five (and last one).  But with all things being equal, season seven, to my surprise, renewed my interest in this TV series, making me remember what I loved in this show in the first place.  And season eight was like an extension of the previous one. I find myself sad that it's all over. Along with \\"The Sopranos\\" and \\"Lost\\", \\"Desperate Housewives\\" was, to me, the best TV series of its era.<br /><br />In this last season, you get the same story arc as before, with each character going through his or her own personal adventures while interweaving his or her path with the others.  Lines are crossed, wars are declared, treasons become necessary, Hearts and lives are broken, secrets are revealed and, ultimately, peace and joy prevail. A central idea dominates the entire season while several other little mysteries are being solved. Always, the voice of Brenda Strong and the quirky music of Steve Jablonski (along with the familiar theme by Danny Elfman) are there to cocoon us.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT:  It's sad that they couldn't get the \\"ghost\\" of Nicollette Sheridan (Eddie Britt). I thought that this was one of the big surprises Marc Cherry was referring to.  Also, i didn't like what happened to Mike. I thought it was too much. They went too far. It wasn't necessary and Terri Hatcher was right to be angry. This is one of the downside in having a long run with a TV series: you go too far in order to surprise the audience. Finally, although I liked the last shot (a new housewife hiding a secret), I would have preferred that they stay with the characters we love.  All of them would stay on Wisteria Lane, except for Susan, and all of them would be without a husband or a boyfriend BUT with a possible chance at reconciliation. I thought that they were going for something like that toward the end. The title of the TV series would then be fitting (\\"Desperate Housewives\\").  And we, as spectators, would have funny fantasies of visiting, in our mind, that famous street later on in order to see old friends we come to love.  Instead, they chose to end it all with a happy ending, thus bringing a new generation of desperate housewives to the Lane. Which is fair enough. But i would have prefered that our beloved desperate hosewives stay desperate.<br /><br />Bravo nonetheless for a terrific, sometimes unequal, run.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very insightful on the ongoing family dynamic of a loyal veteran. Good book for spouses or family members of those wanting to join.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|A great time at the movies. A great job by writer/director Joss Whedon. It's always inspiring to see an artist win his challenge.  And the challenges, here, were huge! The actors obviously had great fun playing their roles.  Tom Hidleston, as the villain Loki, is a marvelous actor to look at. His arrogance, his self-importance, his flamboyance, his smugness, his smile of convenience...  I could never get enough of him. The Hulk was, to my great surprise, the funniest of all the characters. He made me laugh at least three times (when he suddenly punches Thor, when he plays yo-yo with a pompous Loki and when, impatient, he roars at Iron Man and snaps him out of his unconsciousness). Agent Coulson (actor Clark Gregg) was a surprisingly deep and touching character and the always excellent Jeremy Reiner, as Hawkeye, was truly fun to follow. His determination and courage made him as important as the other heroes in the story.  The music by Alan Silvestri is perfectly fitting. I would have loved, though, to hear snippets of each of the character's main theme from their previous movies but darn it! The main theme Silvestri composed for the Avengers still is really exciting. If they could have found a way to include Natalie Portman's character (Jane Foster from \\"Thor\\") at some point,  as well as William Hurt's character (General Thunderbolt Ross from \\"The Incredible Hulk\\"), it would have been the icing on the cake. Why not include the love interest of Bruce Banner too, Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler) and Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins)? I'm positive that they had their place in this story without it being too long. Cameos here and there, ending or starting a scene. No? But hey! That's not really a critic at all. This movie was pure entertainment.  All the iconic images I wanted to see were there, especially the 360 degree camera rotation around the entire Avenger team in the middle of the street.  Or the way they all aim at Loki as he wakes up.  A movie like that is pure candy.Yes, it's exaggerated and yes, the metaphors are quite obvious and big. The story does have its little \\"cheesy\\" morals and values but the smartest thing that Marvel did was to assemble a cast of such great actors and actresses known for their credibility. If they believe it, we, as spectator, do too.  For two hours at least. We gladly play the game.  Now that's what \\"pop corn\\" movies are all about.
B00514HDNW|4.0|The story centers around Robert Neville, a normal \\"every day\\" man who travels to work with his neighbor each day. One day, there is a virus outbreak that converts everyone in the world but him into crazed, flesh seeking monsters that only come out at night. Much like the Resident Evil stories, the dead comeback, reanimated by the virus until either subjected to sunlight, effectively killing the virus or being stabbed with a stake, exposing the virus to oxygen.Robert embarks on a mission to understand the \\"vampire\\" virus only to rule out vampires completely in favor of a much more scientific understanding of the disease.In the novel, he is not a Military LT or genius scientist hellbent on curing the disease but rather a very lonely man, desperately missing his wife spending his time studying about the horrible nightmares that attack his home each night. He spends his days scouring for food, information, disposing of bodies in a fire and trying to better understand what has happened to the world, theorizing on his immunity.His final undoing(as has been mine many times) is by that of a woman he meets and I'll leave it at that so as not to give any spoilers away.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is like a history lesson and I love learning history!Teachers should use this game when they teach their students about Oregon !
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I am enjoying the book -  but it would be easier to negotiate it on the kindle if they were'nt bundled as one book.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|I saw this in the theater and I thought it was great.  I was very dissappointed that it was not a bigger Box-Office Hit.  The movie does a great job all around and it is much creepier and more disturbing than the \\"monsters in the mist\\" conceit would have you thinking. Great job by the cast too, several of whom the director took forward into his next venture... The AMC Television series \\"THE WALKING DEAD\\".  This 2-Disc Blu-Ray has great bonus features and the sound/video are amazing.  I recommend this highly.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is the best weather app I've been able to find so far. It's been very accurate for my area. With 15 day forecast and radar, what more do you need?
B001TH16DI|5.0|I hate buying things over and over again, but you seem to get me every time, especially if the first word in your title is STAR.  I have owned all the Star Trek Movies on VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray.  I actually bought the singles a year and a half ago on Black-Friday, but when this set came out, I had to do it again and buy movies I already had.  The Captain's Summit is worth it.  I love seeing the interaction and hearing the stories.  I have enjoyed things like this (Mindmeld, Trekkies, etc...) in the past, but it is a great looking set and box too.  Hey, it's STAR TREK and you know you want it...
B007N8RULO|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game once I  start. I love to break my own record of less time,  less moves. It is very relaxing but also stimulating the mind.

B003XJDT1W|5.0|This was a great follow up to their debut album. It was a lot of songs and is great to throw on when driving or doing stuff around the house (heck anytime really!) I would definitely recommend this album and can't wait til the next one comes out.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|A must watch show! I love the way they incoperate the original movie into their show and create new twist and turns. I love how they did an old movie make up for the werewolves. I'm excited to see the gag reel and i can't wait for season 2 and btw my favorite character is Stiles.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|No longer worked on HTC EVO so it has been deleted. Tried the update but that caused more problems. If they would fix the problem, I may take another look at it.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was an interesting book that did well to fill in some of the blanks on Jack Reacher's past and how he became the righteous do gooder loner that is portrayed in all of his previous books. The character development was more detailed than previous books but I guess that's the whole idea to get the Reacher back story filled in. A good read for Reacher fans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in a while. I have read all three and I rate them all 5-stars. The way the author describes Grey is so intense. Definitely recommend this book to all women. Enjoy! Hopefully there will be a #4 in the future!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|More challenging than regular Sol. Enjoy it too much! Still trying to get the hang of more than one suit, but overall very entertaining
B002SRQ214|5.0|I was planning to get the i5 2500k because that is pretty standard these days. But man look at the price... ~200 dollars. AND if you want to overclock you need the intel p/z series mobos, meaning more money needed. Already, I was out of budget. So I looked into AMD processors, did my research and I decided to roll with the phenom II x4 965. I am really glad I did because the cpu and mobo combination was FAR cheaper, and the performance was not really hit. Sure the 2500k can overclock better and outperform the 965, but do you really need that much horsepower? I am using my desktop for everyday use/ moderate gaming (Diablo 3 I cannot wait) I also love that the black edition offers overclocking, and I have mine clocked at 4ghz using bus speed of 200mhz and a 20x multiplier. Less stress on mobo as you do not need to stress the northbridge. And it runs pretty cool, with prime95 the temperatures cap at 50 degrees celcius. I have a coolermaster hyper 212+ and it works surprisingly well! The x4 series has known issues of temperatures and these cpus can't really tolerate higher temperatures! So far I have been using my build for about two weeks now, and it is very stable!

B007SYWFRM|3.0|fun but there is something wrong with seeing other villages. also not enough tasks per level. also I don't want to spend any money and it requires you to.
B007R41E8O|5.0|If you like solving mysteries this is the game for you.  If you like hidden object games this is the game for you.  Graphics are great.  I enjoy a good story that makes me use my brain to solve the mystety.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|first review ever. this is best game ive played on my kindle fire and u don't have to spend any money to buy gold or anything
B006Z20976|2.0|I understand this movie is Christian and trying to get a message across. However, regarding the proclamation signing scene, I just can't picture men doing something like that. I can tolerate it in a movie because a movie is just a movie. But it just seems really cheesy to me the way they portrayed it in the movie. Also, they have a Courageous Men's Bible Study now. So I guess men in churches across the country will be doing this ceremony too. Which..just seems a little odd.<br />The movie had several very slow-paced scenes which could easily have been cut out to make the over-long movie a tolerable length. They switched storylines so many times that it was hard to stay focused and about an hour and a half into the movie I was bored and wondering when it would end. Although they had a couple well-done action scenes, overall the movie felt like it dragged on. In many places the dialogue sounded forced and cheesy. I really wanted to like this movie because I am a Christian and movies are meant to send messages and be fun but this one..1) too long. 2) too forced.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Overall, this is a good tool but I upgraded to a newer version and lost everything. All of my tasks and list appear to be gone. I should have kept and older more buggy version. You would think the upgrade would have kept my old data at the very least.
B004WZGHLU|1.0|The copy that I got from Movie Emporium will not work in either my or my daughter's Blu-Ray player, even with software updates.  It took to long to get the updates to return; and, they did not work.
B005FISC52|5.0|As the mother of two teenage girls over the years I have watched the One Tree Series with them and I must admit I have become a real fan myself.  I havent't watched the whole of this last season yet, however from what I have seen already it is fabulous and I must admit I will be a little sad now that's its finished.  Has never failed yet.  Definitely worth a watch.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Well both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig did a pretty job despite the mediocre movie and script.  Since the movie is not a great Western nor a great sci-fy movie, it is a relatively weak movie.  The movie tries to focus too much on too many things thus neither one aspect is very strong.  For westerns there is Silverado, Tombstone, Outlaw Josie Wales, or Shane and for Sci-fy there are movies like War of the Worlds, Independence Day, Star Treks (excluding the new one), Alien series, Close Encounters of the Third kind.  While I applaud Hollywood trying to do something completely new and different than ever attempted, but hopefully this will be the last time to merge these diametrically opposed movies again.  Either focus on either a Sci-fy movie or Western movie with a good story.
B00828G57Y|5.0|It has a great story line amazing cast its a must watch show! one of the best vampire shows out there!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read other \\"smut books\\" and BDSM authors.  This was mild compared to some.  I liked the characters but at times I wanted to hit both of them.  The constant wording about about him touching her \\"there\\" was annoying. We're talking about his \\"play room\\" but we can't use use other terms?  Seemed odd and a little immature. Other parts were very descriptive and hot. I did see similarities to the Twilight Saga characters.  But further along in the book those went away and you saw only James' characters.  I liked the characters and the struggles each were facing.  I did not like the ending personally.  It was a book that kept me reading because I wanted to see how they were going to come to terms with their differences.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first sci-fi novel I've read and I really employed it. The first book in the collection grabbed me, but the next one started a bit slow, but once I hit page 200 I couldnt put it down. Great characters and fantastic finish, can't wait to read what comes next!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a masterpiece....... What a true story........ If you have ever had a dog that you loved or a human that you loved unconditionally you will love this movie. I dont like to say to much about the story as not to spoil any of the experence for the viewer. I just give my opinion if it is good or not. Man raises puppy then they are unfortantely separated that's the premise. Richard Gere is like always, ingaging and believable and supporting cast is good along with direction and photography. 5 star movie I will always tell it like I see it. Add this to your library.
B005J4TLQG|3.0|...and the thugs who attacked and robbed you at knifepoint turn out to really be sweet young fellows who only mugged you becoz they dint know you was from our block, see? Yeah, right.<br /><br />Well, it is a comedy after all, when it decides it is, but then again sometimes it's a morality tale about how misunderstood these sweet young criminals are, despite their willingness to attack a young lady five on one with masks on and knives out. Poor guys! So misunderstood, innit?<br /><br />But then the fake-looking alien apes show up, and much hilarity ensues. And a few deaths. But, whatever. There's a few good jokes, a little suspense, and everybody realizes what heroes these guys really are, robbing girls at knifepoint notwithstanding.<br /><br />So just keep that in mind next time you're being robbed: those guys are probably really nice blokes, just victims of society really, and if your block is ever attacked by alien apes, they'll be your best bet, due to their knowledge of pheromones. Count on it, guv!
B0051CSIKQ|2.0|If you like bad acting, makeup, directing, dialog then this one is for you!! This is nothing more then a BAD B movie, don't waste your time or money like I did listening to the other reviews on this page. If you like a horror movie ( vamp ) with some intelligents look at 30 days of night the first installment. I will always tell it like I see it.  Scott M.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|The first thing that came to mind when this started was Logan's Run, written many years ago by an old friend. I think George would have loved this, not just for the clever plot that borrows only his most essential concept, which was very PK Dick to begin with, but for the heart at the core of this tale.<br /><br />The acting is mostly decent, especially Murphy, and the script falters only now and then with its overuse of merely fair wordplay. But it's the overall premise that keeps this going, being so very close in essence to what's going on in today's world.<br /><br />Yes, this is in fact really a critique of our banking system, and greed in general (New Greenwich is clearly a play on Greenwich, where so many of the Wall Street scumbags live in 100-million dollar homes, paid for by money stolen from our 401ks, and of course those wonderful Obushma bailouts). Just like Niccol's classic Gattaca, the social criticism here is nicely wrapped up in a plot that doesn't hammer the moral home every minute, but by the end you see the injustice very clearly.<br /><br />Timberlake is almost great, but he's still a few films away from the subtlety and quiet power he could have brought to this role. Nonetheless, he's pretty good, all told, and keeps the movie moving through its various twists and turns.<br /><br />The blu-ray has a very nice transfer but doesn't really need it, as the sets are pretty downtrodden to begin with. But the arm clocks are a nice device, and the good docs on the film show the ink dots that were there during filming, and you see how very nicely done the clock effect was. The idea really is great, though of course in reality the time banksters would know where every single until came from and went to. Details like that should be thought of ahead of time, but oh well, at least I will neither die at 25 or live forever, both quite unsavory prospects.<br /><br />In Time is well worth watching and thinking about, in light of our impending global economic collapse.llapse.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I will make this review simple since this is my first. I like smart movies. Ones that keep your attention and don't dumb you down. This movie was the best since the first installment and if you are an M I fan you will like this. Cruse is on his game and the supporting cast is good. If you like action there is some terrific scenes. I give it 4 stars. By Scott M
B004JRVQX0|1.0|If you read in faqs you will see a bunch of people having problems with ilok2. Mine crashed yesterday after 1 month in use. iLok has a really bad rep for customer service too. I hope the manufactures will move away from ilok and pace. Like waves did now. That´s the future. Not this piece of crap.
098357670X|5.0|On reading this book you get the impression that the author really wants to teach you what he knows, rather than throwing a few crumbs to get you interested. It's very detailed and methodically goes through every step of developing a strategy for producing quality caricatures. The author is not only a brilliant exponent of his art, but an excellent teacher. The Mad Art of Caricature is well-thought-out and well-put-together. As a bonus, it's more comprehensive and better-produced than some costlier guides. This book will keep you busy for a while, and the detail is such that it can be used as a reference when further developing your own style. Tom Richmond could have easily gotten away with trading on his name and his amazing art by producing a starter book with lots of his existing material tossed together, but this is no such thing. It's a genuine tutorial - in the form of both graphics and prose - on the art of caricature by someone who is a giant (possibly a hyperactive one) in their field. There's also some excellent ancillary stuff - based on genuine experience - on real-time caricaturing (such as you'd do at amusement parks if you were brave enough). The strategy here differs from doing it in the comfort of your study. This book exceeded my expectations, and I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in any sort of facial artistry.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app ever. We use it all the time and it is extremely helpful. Highly recommend!
0143034901|2.0|I usually finish books, and I usually don't review them here, but I've got to take this one down a few notches.  Whatever the \\"secret\\" was I'll never know because the story was so uninteresting. The main character bumbled around the town of Barcelona finding one dead end after another over and over again. I tried to keep on thinking there would be a payoff, but at a certain point the weak plot got too boring. If you like well crafted stories with no dead ends and characters who have at least some level of wit, say, by the likes of Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett, or James Clavell, DO NOT bother with this one.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like this so far. getting intense a little more each level. I like customizing my defense. I'm wondering how to get more tags without spending real money (sorry loo)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Found the book to be very intense. The story line is very intriguing and definitely wants to make you continue onto the next book. Although this is fiction some of characters can be seen in real life. Have recommended the trilogy to others.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read everything Baldacci has written and in my humble opinion this is his best effort by far.<br />I could not put the book down.
B005R32L66|1.0|Every day there is another update, it's really annoying. Front facing camera works upside down in video chat on my Samsung Infuse.
B003R0MF1W|2.0|Was impressed with how quickly I received the dads but unfortunately two of the discs are unreadable. I am very upset with this.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very satisfied with this product. It does everything it said it would do and more. The material it's made of feels different then just simple plastic. The cover closes shut with a very satifiying \\"fwomp\\" sound that reminds me of the sound a hard back book sounds like when you close it. Also the feltish material that touches the screen wipes away all of your finger smudges, so everytime you flip the cover back you a nice clean screen! And the stand works GREAT it's so cool. I would recomend this to any kindle owner.
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|We were SO looking forward to watching this movie, and when it came time we really did watch it, I found it disappointing because it was hard to correlate where we were in it.  The flashbacks and the present were hard to tell apart.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is by a practicing oncologist with a real literary talent. It present the history of cancer treatment including surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches. Very well worth reading althoug a bit scary. Fortunately, the treatments available to a cancer patient have improved considerably since the early (pre-WWII) days.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Enjoyable read, looking forward to the continuing story, my only dissapointment was that it could have lasted longer. The story is fast paced and hard to put down, and clearly aimed at a younger teen audience, but an enjoyable read for all that
B005723JSQ|5.0|I was laughing out loud, then looking around hoping no one heard or saw me.  Entertaining from the 5th page on through the end of the book.  LOVED IT!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun game to play really didn't expect it to be so fun but it surprised me. lol definately a game worth installing
B005PR2FD8|3.0|This film takes place between Tekken 5 and 6 and basically informs us on how Heihachi returned to the tournament. The cast of characters is short, and the story focuses on the Mishima clan, but the fight at the end is well worth it. if you're a Tekken fan this should be in your library.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I'm no reviewer, i never bother with these things usually but for this CD i thought i would make an exception. First off let me tell you that i am a huge prog fan both classic and neo, the reason i state this will become clear. Secondly i love 70's and 80's pop, i'm not ashamed of it even if i do stash my Abba albums away when friends come over for dinner. Anyway those of you who simply are thinking of buying this album because you understand it has musicians of the finest calibre on it so therefore it must be groundbreaking (whenever that overused term actually means) and so it must push all the boundaries of known music. Well it don't.<br />Actually i don't think i have heard an album for forty years that has achieved such a thing but i digress.<br /><br />  Throw this CD into your player, relax, and enjoy. Deep Purple fans (of which i am one) will enjoy the familiar riffs and runs of the master Steve Morse and will probably smile at the homage to a certain Queen guitarist. With his trusty Bass man Mr LaRue by his side Morse is on top form. Portnoy is Portnoy, nothing more needs to be said really. Neal Morse certainly gets around but his influence here is fairly minimal although i think anyone who knows Neal Morse's music will recognise his masterful input instantly. Which brings to the man who i hadn't even heard of, Casey McPherson. Never heard Alpha Rev but i may now give them a go as i was most impressed with Mr McPherson, the contrast between his vocal and Neal's vocal really worked for me all through this album.<br /><br />Hard to believe they recorded this in nine days! The stand out tracks for me are 'Blue Ocean', 'Kayla', 'Love is what i'm waiting for', 'Everything changes', yes indeed probably all the sing-along pop stuff, oh dear! woe is me. The least favourite are the heavier 'All falls down' and 'Shoulda Coulda Woulda', i never was a metal-head.<br /><br />Oh and for those who thought it was gonna be a prog masterpiece there's a 12 minute sampler in the form of 'Infinite Fire' showing what this album might have been, what a tease!<br />So have some fun, give this a listen, virtuoso musicians and a pop singer joining together to make new-fashioned music the old fashioned way. I absolutely adored it from the first play, you will too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|All you have to do to exit the app is go to stiff, then options, and the menu bar shows up. This app is addicting and it's amazing that it's free. It remain nds me of Tap Zoo.
1466401885|5.0|I am always searching for a book that just blows me away. I found one!!! Finally, an author with an imagination who knows how to develop a story. This is my first book by Ms. McGuire and I am so happy that I bought this book. It is a raw and gritty story that captured and held my attention from the very first page. The story between Travis and Abby, along with Shepley and America, just drew me in and I loved the experience I got from reading it. This is a keeper and will stay with me for a long time. Absolutely loved it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has everything that's in a Bible in a smaller and easier to carry. What could be better than that?
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I really like the game but it always closes when I try to visit a random player.<br /><br />I hate the fact that I have to have energy to do anything. I'm sure its a way to make money because it's tempting to buy more energy just to complete something.<br /><br />I tried to add a friend as a neighbor but that wasn't an option or I didn't figure it out.<br /><br />I like everything else about it except the glitches and energy requirement.
B006G2NVCA|4.0|The CD came in perfect new condition.  I was hoping for more vocal songs, but this set is more background instrumentals.  All in all though, it is a nice collection.
0439023491|5.0|Great book series. I bought the book new, knowing I would want to keep the series for my library. Two of my friends and their kids have read them already and the books are holding up. I was going to buy them at barnes and noble but didn't want to pay the $17.99 price for them, thank you amazon!
0307594777|3.0|While it appears that the books are complete, the binding is either unaligned or crooked...perhaps the pages weren't cut evenly.  When you look at the side to view the pages they are wavy and uneven.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The start of this trilogy hooks you in immediately.  The writing is intense and very well written.  I just finished the second book and am about to purchase the third and final book.  I am quite sad to be almost finished as I haven't read a book or series in quite a while that has me this hooked.  A definite must read!
0545265355|5.0|The product itself was in perfect new condition...the story was riveting.  I could not put them down and read all three books within a weeks time.  Superb!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|works on my two devices, and because it looks for all storage locations, its easy to open any pdf you had or get in future...but there better apps out there that do more.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been playing this game on my fire for a month now.  so far so good.  It runs great and its a lot of fun.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|Incredible A-list cast, confusing plot, bad effects/sound, etc. I agree with other reviews that the movie was probably designed to highlight Gina Carano.  She is not nearly as bad as others have indicated.  If you're looking to kill 93 minutes - then it's fine.  Don't look for deep thoughts.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|game has great graphics and kids all ages like it from 2 - 40 we enjoy playing it together as a family
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As soon as I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I looked forward to down time so I could get back to reading it. It is an easy read and it capture your attention.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved it. It slammed me. Thank goodness there is a second book..  I can not start the second book fast enough!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I watch the news and read a lot but this book really opened my eyes to what is happening in North Korea. I knew it was a not so great place but after reading this book it really shines a light on how bad it really is. My heart goes out for the North Koreans. I love that the book gives you some history of what has been going on in North Korea as well as tells Shin's story.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy had me hooked from day one. I read all three books in the course of a week. I found myself up until 5am because I could not put the book down. It made me laugh, cry, and mostly smile!!! What else can I say besides, I WANT MORE!! I was thrilled that the Epilogue included Christian's view of his first few encounters with Anna. I would love to read the books from his point of view.<br />As much as I would love to see this as a movie, I just don't think they will ever be able to recreate the sex scenes without taking away from all that is imagined and felt when reading the books.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is a very addictive game! I just started playing it and I find it hard to put it down. Add me cassier20
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some off the games lack excitement.  And other ones. are fun.  for a free game it is good. I would not pay for this game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This works on my blackberry; kindle fire; Pc; and any browser. A great solution for running communications for a house.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|With so many of my favorite actors and actresses, it was hard NOT to like this movie. There are a lot of different characters with (mostly tumultuous) interweaving love stories that really drive the movie. The main female character is so helplessly in love, that her pathetic attempts at wooing men lead to embarrassingly hilarious situations that keep you laughing, despite the sadly flailing relationships of some of the other stories. Definitely worth watching! If you liked this, I would also recommend Something Borrowed, which also stars Ginnifer Goodwin (in a slightly more likeable role!)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|my five year old son got this app to help in learning to read but I have to admit I use it a lot too
B006IGZX0C|5.0|The Help was a surprise to me.  I had heard that the book was a great read, but hesitated because usually i choose the mystery.  The \\"Millennium series\\" trilogy by Stieg Larsson is by far the best in that category. I would have to say though that \\"The Help\\" and \\"Water for Elephants\\" which is also out of my usual choices, are two of the best listens around.  The story and narration are excellent.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|loved it!! awesome and well made!!! i recommend!! the graphics are good and i love how its customizeable. veryyyy addicting!!
0385344228|3.0|Defending Jacob started out strong but withered as the reader read on. It tackled some interesting subject matter but left the reader let-down at the end. Should have rewritten the last chapter to made it more powerful!
0345803485|1.0|Yes, I was curious, but not exactly \\"Curious Yellow.\\" By contrast, that sex film from decades ago was a masterpiece compared with this drivel.  Has E. L. James never encountered an adjective she didn't like?  Or a pile of modifiers she didn't feel compelled to string together to flesh out her imbecilic sentences?  I confess that I could only get through the first two chapters, so I never got to the titillating  stuff.  As I read, I had to stifle my derisive laughter.  I can't recall the last time I read something this inane.  Who was the agent and/or editor who decided this was worthy of killing trees to print.  Well, folks, there's  a sucker born every day, and I must be one of them for buying this hyped piece of moronic trash.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a die-hard fan of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, novellas, and novel. This film lacked most of what I enjoy in those stories -- the wit, the suspense, the great dialogue, the panache. It has been replaced on the screen with fairly uninteresting CGI battles and a great deal of grunting in place of dialogue. I think the moment that most captured this for me was when the movie touched on Conan's famous carpe diem speech: \\"Let me live deep while I live. Let me enjoy the sting of red wine on my palate, the embrace of white arms, ... I live, I burn with life, I slay, I am content.\\" The movie reduced that to a very brief one-liner so insipid I can't even recall it.<br /><br />The villains are uninspiring. The setup for the heroine had potential but they didn't really do anything interesting afterward, nor even give her any good lines...<br /><br />I think what irks me is this: Robert E. Howard, whether you love his work or loathe it, is excellent at writing compelling pulp. He does fast-paced, entertaining plots. He comes up with intriguing bad guys and intriguing monsters. When he's writing his better work and not shlock, he also produces memorable women in the supporting roles -- Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, Belit of the Black Coast. In other words, his fiction hands Hollywood action movie fodder on a silver platter. Yet against all logic, Hollywood entirely fails to do anything compelling with it. It's completely without excuse.<br /><br />Forgive me if this review proves not particularly detailed or useful, but I am just too irritated. I didn't have high expectations for the film (though I had hopes), but it hit so low beneath even the expectations I did have that I am ... just irritated.<br /><br />To give the film its due, two strong points:<br />* Conan actually LOOKS like Conan. The \\"dark-haired, sullen-eyed,\\" etc. -- they got that.<br />* The first 20 minutes are good storytelling. The backstory in Cimmeria, the Picts ... not brilliant, but very well done.<br /><br />That said, anyone looking for an invigorating and faithful adaptation -- look for [[ASIN:1593079818 Conan: Born on the Battlefield (Conan (Dark Horse Unnumbered))]]. This graphic novel was beautifully drawn and well-scripted. Unlike this film, unfortunately.brilliant, but very well done.<br /><br />That said, anyone looking for an invigorating and faithful adaptation -- look for [[ASIN:1593079818 Conan: Born on the Battlefield (Conan (Dark Horse Unnumbered))]].

B000026OW3|5.0|This 11 CD set sees Rubinstein in fine form playing most of the works of one of the finest composers who ever lived. The sound quality of the first 10 discs is great, the last CD isn't as good but definitely listenable. While people may quarrel over interpretations of the pieces, everyone will agree on the amazing value for money you get here. You wouldn't see a price like this in your dreams.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0439023491|3.0|Well, I finished the first Hunger Games novel and enjoyed it a lot. It was a very fine novel that took time to paint meaningful sketches of the characters, to establish the rules and values of the world, and to set up a reasonable (and exciting and fast-paced) plot. And one of the very interesting things about Hunger Games was its sort of claustrophobic feel--we were only getting to see the world from Katniss's view and from within her small world of District 12 and the games. But the hints about turmoil going on outside are there, and it really intrigued me, and so I was very ready, when I finished that novel, to launch into Catching Fire.<br /><br />Catching Fire, however, doesn't immediately carry on the momentum of the first novel. The novel begins pretty slowly, with Katniss's relationships sort of having been put on hold and without the tension of the games overhead. Collins spends a good bit of time gesturing at and outlining the burgeoning conflict between the districts and the capital. Obviously, some of this exposition is necessary, but I think that Collins may have shown a bit too much restraint at the beginning. I had to force myself through until the plot picked up. I also found myself frustrated with Katniss at the beginning. I loved her determination, sense of responsibility, self-confidence, and stoicism (that had big cracks in it) in the first novel, but Katniss seems pretty different here. She's more prone to melodrama...and to whining  to the reader.<br /><br />I also missed some of the relationships that added tension and emotional depth to the first book. Katniss lacks the developing and heart-squeezing relationships in this game like she had in the first. No connections like Rue (no other side characters--including Finnick and Johanna--are drawn as vividly or sympathetically in the novel). And even though Peeta's present, there's no level of connection between them as was maintained in the first novel. I understand that Katniss has put up some extra barriers between herself and everyone else following her experience in the first games, but this detracts some from the experience of the novel. There is no potential in Catching Fire for the sorts of poignant gestures (i.e. Rue's death, Peeta's and Katniss's near berry-eating) that made Hunger Games a success.<br /><br />Those things said, Catching Fire did have several elements that worked well. Once the characters are back in the games, I enjoyed the creativity of this new world. I enjoyed seeing how they could manipulate the clock structure and force fields. And I admire that the novel is trying to push the story into more ambitious territory, with the revolution becoming central to the plot. The beginning of the novel dragged a bit, making me want to rush through it to the end, but the second half of the novel hooked me again and made me want to get on to the finale.extra barriers between herself and everyone else following her experience in the first games, but this detracts some from the experience of the novel.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a great series, so I love with christian and Anastasia's story! Little bit of love with some \\"spice\\" added to it!!! Hoping there's a 4 th book and I cannot wait to see the movie, hope it does the book justice!
0439023513|1.0|First of all, I'm not the sort of reader who absolutely has to have a clear-cut happy ending. I have wide tastes and an open mind and can list some devastating, sad, and even angry stories amongst my favorites. But those books are each fully realized works of art in which the ending was the logical and inevitable conclusion, set up from the first moment by the author, and in which a coherent statement is being made. I looked very forward to reading the ending of Mockingjay, but in the end, it seems to have written pretty haphazardly, and it mostly fails, in the end, at realizing the promise of the first novel.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, Katniss has been rescued from the Quarter Quell and carried off to District 13 to be the figurehead of the rebellion against Panem. She doesn't fully trust the rebel leaders, however, and it takes a while for her to be convinced to join in their efforts. She eventually does and will take part in producing propaganda material and in attacking the capital. Peeta, meanwhile, had been captured by the Capital forces, and his rescue will be difficult indeed.<br /><br />A few things worked in the novel. I liked that the rebel forces were pretty complex; they weren't simply the good guys. And I thought that the depictions of District 13 and the battles were vivid and appropriately grim. Collins has not sugar-coated the effects of war in the novel. Also, I definitely didn't find the beginning of the novel to be as slow-going as Catching Fire's had been.<br /><br />However, several things kept irking me. First, so many of the side-characters are very thinly portrayed or imagined. Prim and Katniss's mother, for instance, are so barely fleshed out (as are some other characters--i.e. Finnick and Boggs) that it's very difficult to care about them as much as Collins seems to want us to at points.<br /><br />Second, a *lot* of the major action (I won't say what) occurs while Katniss is knocked out. I kept wondering why Collins would build up and build up something only to have Katniss come up unconscious during the big moment. Then, we'd learn about it in an unsatisfying recap later. Third, just everything didn't make sense. I can't begin to list the number of moments I thought, \\"What?!?\\" They're shooting at hover craft bombers with bows and arrows (even if they are special ones)? This miner/hunter kid (Gale) with only the Capital's education can suddenly work on sophisticated bombs? Honestly, etc., etc., etc... Fourth, as so many have noted, a lot of smaller plot points are just left untied at the end.<br /><br />Mainly, though, I was bothered by Katniss's degeneration in the series. I can understand that the sorts of experiences that she underwent could make you more cynical and bitter. But the thing that we love about Katniss from the beginning of the series is how she survives, filled with a tough and well-earned hopefulness and love, despite the severe deprivation and loss that she's experienced. I keep thinking back to two moments in The Hunger Games--when Katniss movingly offers tribute to Rue's lifeless body and when Peeta and Katniss are willing to choose death together rather than to accede fully to the values of the games. Those two moments, in my opinion, encapsulate both the best aspects of Katniss's character and the core vision of the books. They're about the way that goodness, courage, love, and hope may survive in the face of injustice and cruelty. But the Katniss of Mockingjay, however, is not the same Katniss of those moments. She is too bitter. She lacks trust and compassion at the end. And absolutely *no* moment in either Catching Fire or Mockingjay comes anywhere close to matching the poignancy and meaning of those two scenes either. To me, the most appealing, most hopeful, and most core vision of The Hunger Games has been abandoned in the final book. The two-page epilogue at the end doesn't save it either; after what has occurred for the last 388 pages, it seems false. The ending just doesn't do justice--in terms of character, plot, or theme--to the best aspects of the trilogy.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|What a terrible showing from one of the most instinctively gifted writers in the genre. This is not a novel but a collection of short stories; unfortunately unlike great short story anthologies these stories don't  find closure. Making the whole thing a confused mess. I think RR Martin is tired of the series and can't find it's heart anymore, something he implies in the author's note. He's got the talent, maybe it's time to start a fresh story altogether, one that he can fall in love with again.

1451648537|5.0|Mr. Isaacson has done a wonderful job about covering the key aspects and events of Steve Jobs' life. However, I don't believe the author realized that his subject matter was more than just one of the 20th Century's greatest businessmen and a grade-A A-hole. Due to our family situation, my wife happened to attend a lecture by Temple Grandin at the same I was completing Mr. Isaacson's biography. Ms. Grandin had no bones about correctly claiming that Mr. Jobs had high-functioning autism also known as Asperger's Syndrome. Because our family is well educated in this area and there are so many aspects of the Apple founder's personality that fit, I'm surprised it didn't become obvious to the author.<br /><br />The book could be broken down into two parts. The first half focuses more on Steve Jobs' personality and the second half follows his amazing list of accomplishments. Because of Mr. Jobs' success, many people were willing to bend over backward to justify his horrible behavior towards others. He truly revolutionized society in so many ways it is difficult to believe one man did all this. Without a doubt, he will be known a hundred years from now in the same business pantheon as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. However, there is no way in God's creation I could have worked for such a bombastic jerk. His nasty actions towards others can not be excused despite the fact he was an Aspie. On the other hand, his absolute need to control every part of his life, managing pigheaded engineers who are notorious for being mostly Aspies and his dickish personality were likely the only way such revolutionary products as the personal computer, visual graphics, computer animation, the iPod, iPad, iPhone and iCloud could have come into fruition. Also, his great design sense of simplicity being the ultimate sophistication made technology accessible to all.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was brilliant, cruel, charismatic, impatient, a talented marketer, manipulative, not very ethical, a perfectionist, obnoxious, an artist and a visionary. His famous \\"reality distortion field\\" (a Trekkie label that could apply to most Aspies,) would not have served him well in a leadership position outside of the business field. Despite his skewed adherence to Zen Buddism, Mr. Jobs would have probably been one, seriously nasty dictator. I admire the man's tremendous accomplishments, but as a empathetic human being... yuck. The author has done a commendable job by writing a warts-and-all, entertaining biography. As usual, Mr. Jobs' genius for picking the right people has given the world another wonderful product. Mr. Isaacson's biography meets up to the late SOB's high standards. Enjoy., obnoxious, an artist and a visionary.

B007EC6FIS|1.0|I find it sad to think that all the naysayers of their last two releases could have sent Keane into second guessing their sound and playing it safe with such a boring album. We don't need another Hopes and Fears and if we did, this ain't it. By moving back toward the original piano sound and dropping most of the \\"experimental\\" sounds of the last two great releases, Keane leaves us with some of the most cliched lyrics of all time, with all the subtlety of Bon Jovi. We've heard all these melodies before, just nothing new. If you need more HAF, I suggest the Deluxe version of that album, with all the early stuff and demos. I liked HAF as a first album, but it did seem very repetitive in sound, speed, and content. Personally, Keane came alive with their next three releases, each exploring it's own world while still throwing in a few HAF style classics. There are probably a few of those here, but I don't think I want to find them. I guess I'm the rare old school listener who is excited by change and evolution...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game a great way to pass the time... be careful though because it is very addictive... its not just for the kids even though mine love it...
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|Yes, it's not like Hopes and Fears! Yes, Strangeland is like HAF, and this is exactly what makes Strangeland fall flat. All bands evolve and sometimes they stretch out beyond what their fan base wants. The funny thing is that there are 3 very great and somewhat classic Keane songs on this EP, but folks seem to want nothing but the cliched Keane sound. Keane's biggest weakness has been the obvious and heard a million times before lyrics, so it's nice to hear all the variety in sound on this EP to play down the lyrical weakness and inspire more adventurous words. This is an EP, not an album, meaning it will have A and B sides, like an old 12\\" EP. Sure, the Japanese singing is pretty WTF at first, but it works as a totally different vibe. Like most really great recordings, it takes a few listens to to get it.
0451205766|5.0|Fantastic book. I re-read this recently and enjoyed it just as much reading it for a second time. The story focuses on the Italian mafia and it is a bit gory in parts. It is very fast paced and the characters are brilliant. The films are great but the books are even better.

0312641893|4.0|Grades 7 and up<br /><br />*Review does contain some spoilers.<br /><br />This is not just another Cinderella story, this is a unique, creative, and innovative retelling that Marissa Meyer knocked out of the park.<br /><br />Cinder is an orphaned Cyborg, part human, part machine, with no memory of her parents. She was adopted by a man who dies of a plague that has invaded New Beijing, where Cinder lives, and there is no cure. She has been  left as the ward of a Step-mother who hates her, and two step-sisters....one whom she loves and cares for, and one that hates her, like all step-sisters in Cinderella stories.<br /><br />It's been over 100 years since World War IV has ended, peace talks with the Lunar Queen are ongoing, and the emperor has contracted the plague. Palace doctors are frantically working on an antidote to save the emperor. His son, and successor to the throne is Prince Kai. His android is broken down, and Princess Kai must get her fixed soon, for she holds secrets that could keep him from a dreary future that is on the horizon. Princess Kai delivers his android to the marketplace for repair where he instantly clicks with an android mechanic who is renowned for her skills, Cinder.<br /><br />Will Princess Kai convince Cinder to attend the annual ball as his special guest? Can she hide the fact that she's part machine from him? ....and How will Cinder handle discovering that she is the one that can save the future of her world?<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />I listened to Cinder on audio CD, and thoroughly enjoyed it! I was expecting the typical retelling, but was completely relieved that Marissa Meyer's gave us a fresh, creative story! This story has tragedy, romance, political unrest, identity crisis, and more! Though this story was a retelling of Cinderella, there were differences such as:<br /><br />Cinder was very close with one of the step-sisters.<br />Prince Charming (AKA Prince Kai) romanced Cinder. He wanted her with him from their first meeting, and didn't hide that....he invited her to the ball and defended her honor when it needed defending.<br />There was no lost slipper, however there was a Cyborg foot that came off.<br />The Prince did not have to find the identity of the owner of the foot, but did discover who Cinder really was.....and still has a lot to learn about her true identity.<br />And after book one in the series, there is not a Happily Ever After.<br />This book is a hit with me, and Marissa Meyer's, much to my frustration, left a great cliff-hanger, that's going to make February 5, 2013 seem forever away. That is the expected release date for Scarlet, the 2nd book in the Lunar Chronicles.

B006Z20976|4.0|'Courageous' explores the issue of fatherhood, and our duties as Christian fathers.      Near the beginning of the film we are hit with the sociological reality that the vast majority of our prison inmates, drug addicts and troubled youths grew up without involved fathers.  The main characters are police officers and as the film progresses they are confronted with their frailties as fathers and inspired to take public vows affirming their commitment to being Godly fathers.      It has been said that our age is suffering from a crisis of men, that many of us are allergic to commitment and want to cling to our adolescence, refusing the responsibility of becoming an adult.  There is a lot of truth to that.  It is refreshing to see a movie confront this crisis head on and call on men to step up and be men.      The movie is enjoyable.  Unlike 2006's 'Bella', which starred Eduardo Verastegui, and was an effective evangelistic tool to address the issue of abortion, 'Courageous' does not boast professional actors.  It is somewhat apparent at times, but the acting really isn't bad.  Some parts seem a little forced but others are done superbly.  At one point it delivers a poignant and extremely believable portrayal of a Christian family's struggle through unexpected tragedy.      It is refreshing to see a film in which the characters speak openly of Jesus in a reverent manner, women are dressed modestly and the language is inoffensive.  This from a film that deals often with issues of crime, such as drug abuse and violence.  It is a good model for other Hollywood producers.  'Courageous' also has its share of action, suspense and even humor.  It is a film worth seeing.      One can only hope films like 'Courageous', 'Fireproof' and 'Bella' are only the beginning of a movement of Christian filmmakers bringing their faith to the big screen.  Movies can be a powerful tool of evangelization and a means of bringing God back into the conversation of the issues of our day.    John[...]

0345803485|5.0|First off, I would like to mention that I have never read the twilight series (although I have seen the movies) I couldn't bring myself to do it because I figured it would be a horrible read. I felt this way about this book; however, a good friend of mine (whom I trust)suggested I read it. It was not what I expected! By the third chapter I was giddy like a school girl and I was \\"Blushing\\". In the beginning she resembles Bella from twilight; clumsy and awkward, she is also educated and witty.<br /><br />This is about a man that tries to \\"control a woman with power\\" as noticed someone wrote, yet she fights back with her wit and her unwillingness to conform. Although she does give in to his will (to an extent) she also gets him to compromise. And that is worth a read in itself.<br /><br />I loved this book and read it in 7 hours over the weekend. I cant WAIT to get the second one!!!!

0439023513|4.0|After reading several bad reviews, I concluded that the reasons for the low ratings isn't determined by Ms. Collins' ability to write well and hook her readers in a completely enticing novel. It was because these characters didn't drive off into the sunset and live happily ever after. I enjoyed this book of true, hold-nothing back, give-it-everything-you-got writing. I believe that Ms. Collins poured her heart and soul into these novels and didn't sugar coat the truth for her readers. She forced them to see the truth of war, its not something to be proud of or to marvel at, its something that leaves you drained and horrified, which is exactly what this book did to me. By the time I finished the last sentence, I felt a grief come over me that did not subside for several days. I know that sounds horrible and terrifying, however, I feel that is proof of a great and intelligent author. They have the ability to wrap you in their stories, and make you see things as they truly are. Thank you Ms. Collins, for holding nothing back and giving me a story that will stay with me for a long time.

0553381407|5.0|The book Toxic In-Laws was recommended to me on a forum.  Instead, I purchased this book first.  I have to say that it is truly an AMAZING book, but that you must be careful as you begin to read.  You need to have support from others around you or have some time in your hands to ensure that these issues do not overpower you.  I am about 2/3rds done in reading the last two days and the emotions this has stirred up inside of me have hit me like nothing before.  It wore me out.  It is a very powerful book that will no doubt stir a huge amount of emotions within you.  It has literally worn me out, although I do believe that it is something that needed to be done and addressed vs. what has been done in the past, which is bury everything inside of me.  If throughout my life I felt I did not need counseling, and tried to put things behind me, this book has definitely made me realize that there are so many issues at hand, that I must do something about it and cannot continue my life pretending everything is ok.<br /><br />Again, I strongly recommend this book, but I believe you need to have time and support to get these issues out in the open.

0374203032|4.0|We may add to Michael Sandel's list of what money can't buy. Many years ago Paul Samuelson said that \\"love for love is not the same thing as love for money\\", what he implied was that there are commodities inherently different from each other while we might wrongly consider them as the same or similar. He tried to answer the question that why in Europe people donate blood for free while in the US it is a common practice that some people donate blood in exchange for money. The first is motivated by a sense of benevolence, the second by desperation or call it greed. In any case these are not, based on economist's points of view, the same commodities. May be people can't buy love with money but it is because this is not a unique well defined and marketable commodity. We can't buy a well to do father or caring mother and faithful friends. It is not because of moral limits to the market but because of the nature of these commodities and the technology of their production in society.<br />I want to point out a couple of defects in Mr. Sandel's arguments. First of all competitive markets are efficient mechanisms of allocation and that is all. No further claims on that on the part of economics. It is more efficient to put a price on not waiting in line for the passengers. Because otherwise there is deadweight loss involved, people in line pay by their time and nobody receives. Furthermore those who are in a hurry missing their plane, or those who have more money in their pocket or value their time higher pay, the others won't. This is more efficient. The argument that bearing the burden of national security has to be distributed equally (and so everybody has to equally wait in airport security line), does not stand on solid grounds. This is not a sound argument. May be those who can afford more should pay more. Why nations usually won't send the elderly to the war front? Because it is the young and the strong who can afford the burden. Those who are rich should pay more taxes to finance wars because of higher ability to pay. Line standing business adds to efficiency too. It partially corrects an allocation mechanism that has been inefficient and poorly designed on the first place.<br /><br />Mr. Sandel should have made a more vigorous presentation of how higher morality could have possibly solved such issues as the line standing business at the entrance of a theater for which demand is far more than supply. How possibly decentralized decisions of people with supposedly higher moral standards could make the demand equal to supply for such services (including the case of line jumping in amusement parks)? The greed is easy to be blamed. From the antiquity prophets, saints and philosophers have blamed greed for much mischief. But unfortunately every body is more often greedy, and more or less fewer times benevolent. Wall street's ailment is not going to be remedied by combating greed. The answer is a better mechanism and system design. The more one thinks about the subject, it seems systems that more closely emulate competitive market solutions are the best practical solutions. One reason for the claim is that alternative approaches make compelling and sentimental arguments, but no practical solutions follow.
0345803485|3.0|I was THRILLED to finally get my hands on this little book after hearing so much about it, and watching all my friends read it and get all giddy.<br /><br />I'm a 36 yr old mother of 2 btw, and I did read the Twilight series.<br /><br />I understand Twilight \\"fan fiction\\"  but some of the stuff is flat out ripped out of Twilight and put in 50 Shades... on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Here be some spoilers!!<br /><br />Ok, I do not know of ONE woman that has EVER had 2 orgasms on her very first try.  I don't even know if that crap is possible.  If he is as big as the book claims, she would need at least 2 days to recover, but she was an oral PRO by the next day and taking it again, like well.. an old Pro!!! LOL  And being a virgin, but wanting someone to dominate you when you don't even know what that is???? oh, COME ON!!!! Can't we at least try to be a little realistic??  She makes Ana sound just moronic, on top of naive.<br /><br /> So she meets this guy, barely knows him, let's him take her out of the city, shows her a toture room and then makes her sign documents so he can do whatever he wants to her????  Wow, every mother's dream man.  Yikes!  AND she is more than happy to go along with this.  Show's alot for young women and self esteem.  I'm actually a little sad that a woman wrote this.<br /><br />Christian may as well be 57 in the book if she's gonna make him 27.  I don't know many 27 year olds that act like uptight overbearing fathers and never seem to lighten up...although I don't know all people so I guess I could be wrong.  I keep picturing Christian Bale's \\"Patrick Bateman\\" but minus the serial killing.<br /><br />There is some titilating stuff in the book, for sure, but it's very repetitive and she seems to me to be the most accepting, moronic, naive girl in the world and for me it just makes the story very unbelievable; romance or otherwise.  I'm actually bummed, and am not sure I even want to continue with the other 2 books now.
B007URCTOG|5.0|This is surprisingly good and well made, much better than I expected. And the vows are just so beautiful. I thought I knew how the story would unfold but it doesn't happen exactly like what you'd expect. Overall a nice surprise and high quality movie.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Dragon Bound<br />I did really love this book.  Pia Giovanni is blackmailed by an ex-boyfriend into stealing from one of the great world Powers, a dragon.  His name is Dragos and he is to be feared, he is dominant and ruthless and doesn&iexcl;¦t ask, but orders people around.  Dragos is determined to find the thief and make them pay.  Since so much is left out of the official synopsis I will try to refrain from using spoilers here º<br /><br />Pia is the only one left in the world who knows her real name (not Pia Giovanni, which is a fake name) and what she really is.  She is half shifter, half human and her mother spent her entire life teaching Pia how to disguise herself as well as giving her the resources to disappear if she needs to.  I did not guess what Pia was.<br /><br />The dark fae king, Urien is after Pia as well.  He also wants to kill Dragos.  Pia must ally herself with one of them if she hopes to survive.  But she also must keep her identity a secret even though it seems that the Elves know more about her and her mother than she does and both Dragos and Urien are trying their darnedest to figure her out.<br /><br />The secondary characters are great as well.  I love Rune and Grayden and Tiago and Tricks&iexcl;Kthe list could probably go on and on.  Rune is Dragos second in command and is very stoic.  Grayden is a gryphon and is very charming.  Tiago is a thunderbird and I believe the second book is about him.  Tricks is Urien&iexcl;¦s niece and the rightful queen of the dark fae.
030788743X|5.0|Put simply, if you love video games, and were born before 1990, you have to read this book.<br /><br />Ready Player One is set in the not so distant future. It revolves around OASIS, which is sort of like Facebook + WOW + Second Life, but much higher-tech. It's essentially a virtual existence.<br /><br />One of the two creators of OASIS has passed away. Having no children or spouse, he creates a scavenger hunt of sorts within the confines of OASIS. Whoever can find this easter egg he's hidden will inherit his share of OASIS. (Worth billions of dollars) He leaves only a riddle behind, although it's common knowledge that he was obsessed with 80s culture, and therefore it's assumed that pop culture references somehow factor in to the hunt.<br /><br />Millions hunt (\\"Gunters\\") for the egg, including an evil multinational corporation. Wade Owen Watts is our hero, an overweight, antisocial orphan. He lives more in OASIS than in the real world, and has immersed himself in 80s pop culture. Due to his unrivaled knowledge, Wade becomes the first person in the world to solve the first clue in the hunt. He becomes famous, meets others with similar interests, and faces real world threats because of his discovery.<br /><br />The book is a thrill ride from start to finish. It's perfectly paced and you'll never want to set it down. The entire hunt revolves around hundreds of references to 80s music, movies, games, novels and comics. It's just a fun read. There's tons of action and comedy, but the book can also be surprisingly touching. There's a love story here that I won't get too much into, but it's very well written. You'll love the characters by books end, and wishing there were another 400 pages to read.<br /><br />I can't recommend Ready Player One enough. Just a delight all around.
0307477479|2.0|I love the experimental structure of this book--that's about it though.  Basically, Benny and Sasha, the two main characters, are boring.  The author attempts to spice them up with dimensionally by using sexual depravity and emptiness, but it doesn't bring any shape to the characters--it just makes you feel like crap; this is typical in modern fiction...especially if it's based in New York and San Francisco.<br /><br />It's all very typical: the token gay guy who's suicidal because no one accepts him, Freudian background stories that push empathy, sexual frankness to shock the reader (aren't we numb to this now?), New Yorkian elitism, blah, blah, blah--<br /><br />IF THIS STORY WAS TOLD IN LINEAR ORDER, NO ONE WOULD FIND IT AT ALL INTERESTING, but I still can't fathom, even with a good structure, how this won the pullitzer prize, but I do see how it could be an HBO special.<br /><br />I don't understand how people don't understand this book.  It's very simple: A series of short stories that are interconnected--I don't think there's much meaning beyond that.<br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn't waste your money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A believable world, interesting characters. A story that doesn't grow stale, but keeps finding new hooks to draw you in. With thoughtful and technically detailed environments, Hugh has obviously either done a lot of homework, or been an engineer. I honestly never thought to read a character tapping a thread, and was disproportionately excited. I will be buying the collected works as soon as I finish this sentence.
B0009P66TK|4.0|Bought the watch as an anniversity present for my boyfriend and he loved it.  Loved the large face and especially the band.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is like I put in the title, completely AWESOME! If you love fairy tales growing up, and always wondered how they would look/act in real life...you will love this show. And it takes it to a different level too meaning that you get to see how the characters all interact with one another within the fairy tales (whose friends, whose not) and personal view points of the characters. I have LOVED this show since the beginning episode and I will continue to be a faithful Storybrooke follower until that fateful day when we hear Series finale. I hope and pray that will not be for a long time though!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm so glad that I got this app!!!!!I love that if there is a Bible verse I like I can bookmark it and come back later and then read it.Plus if I get tired it will read it to me. Of course you are gonna see comments of people who don't like the app, but download the app for yourselve and see what you think of it!!!!!:)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this game!  It's your basic tower defense - nothing ground breaking,  but it has me totally hooked.  Simple gameplay.  Challenging levels. Fun bonus game to win free stuff to help you advance.  Recommending it to all my friends!
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Mr. Miller is one of my favorite directors but I was a little hesitant about watching this movie after seeing such a low rating for this. Then I read the reviews and realized that there was something fishy about the bad reviews. After watching the movie twice (in one day) I think I can guess which gang wrote those bad reviews. I will reveal that at the end. (SPOILER warning towards the end.)<br /><br />I will not cover the story line but will say that the cast is full of lively characters, all with different accents and different musical tastes, and never putting down any one. This movie is a celebration of diversity. There was even one line by a penguin in an Indian accent and it was delivered naturally and surprise surprise it was not for some comic effect as I have come to expect in a typical Hollywood movie.<br /><br />The tunes were catchy - even the opera-based number by the little penguin praising his dad, which nearly brought to my eyes, and the movie ended with a song based on wonderful Janelle Monae's Tightrope.<br /><br />Talking of diversity - Will and Bill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon) are two tiny krills who make a difference in their own way. Their dialogue will be fun for smart grown-up kids.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT - Please stop now if you don't want to know the spoiler.<br />x<br />x<br />x<br />The movie maker added one more piece of diversity - about 2-3 lines between the two krills, which will be caught only by mature kids or grown-ups, indirectly alluded to attraction felt by one of the krills. My guess is that's where haters, the ones writing one star reviews jumped in. On orders of some Christian-fundamentalist group the reviews were written perhaps without ever watched the movie.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Awesome second album for this band. Their first album rocked and this follow on continues. The darker side of Mz Hyde seems more like the rock I've heard from them live and should be released soon as a single. If you enjoyed their first album, you will love this one.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Such an intimate setting. I love anything and everything Florence + the Machine so of course I enjoyed this CD DVD combo.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I love this game! It is a little hard and the screen moves a little too fast. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is not worth the $1 I paid.
0345803493|5.0|some of the repeatition because I never wanted the story to end! The second book breaks through the barriers and sheds some light on the unknown - again such a beautiful story of redemption!
1455508977|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book. I really enjoyed the movie so I decided to try one of Nicholas sparks books out. Which I would suggest to read them. I have read the last song and the lucky one. I have noticed that all of them have a sad part. So if you aren't looking for a book that's not all happy then I suggest not to read his books.i thought it was a really cute book/ movie. The book and movie are different from each other in some parts but overall they are both good. I enjoyed the differences in both. I woulnd't say I liked one more than the other.if that helps at all. Has a really cute storyline and has a good ending. I thought that there could have been a little bit longer ending but I guess it leaves it open more you to imagine what could happen next. Isn't open enough for another book though. So hopefully this is somewhat helpful.
0345803507|5.0|I really do love a story full of redemption which sums up this series. Parts of the book were alot to take in to be perfectly honest, but Christian Grey captured my heart and Ana Steele instilled her courageous and brave spirit. I never wanted this to end and I was a bit dissappoint with the epilogue, must be a trend in writing but never the less the book won my heart and I want to continue to read it over and over again to enter their world once again, I truly hope a movie is really in the works - I'll be in HEAVEN!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a great season to watch. Very much a fantacy but a good one. Can't wait for the second season to begin.
0345803485|5.0|On what I was about to read, but ever so quickly the story captured my heart and reguardless of some of the erotic nature, the story itself is endearing and you can't help but fall in love with the characters, I couldnt put the book down was up to all hours in the night and finished all 3 books in 5 days!!!Now all I can think of is the world of Christian Grey, I'm pretty sure I will pick it up and read it again next week :).
1439192812|2.0|Book, regretably,was written for middle schoolers. If not, it insults the intellience of teenagers and adults. Book talks down to the reader, fills its pages with \\"interesting\\"(that's sarcasm) metaphors to cute things, and take 3-4 times as many pages to explain something as necessay. I would say poor editing but it seems to be the style of the writer. He could use  a review of the old Carl Sagan shows to learn how to instruct and entertain without being patronizing.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I like it but its in some ways copmlicated or hard of use so if your in a hurry (wicht is unlikely but still possible) you forget things and cant set it for lack of bigger buttons.
0684833395|1.0|It was the slowest book I have ever read. Joseph Heller over describes the characters and tries to use a 1960's euphoric childish humor that more irony than anything. 3 key words, Do Not Read
B007B6VOG0|3.0|Half of this album is FANTASTIC. Some Nights = so much fun. We are Young = goes without saying. Carry On = love it.<br /><br />The other half sounds like it's stuck in the 90's, and not in a good way. I deleted the song It Gets Better from my itunes. It's super repetitive without much creativity. The message is lovely, the song is not. One foot is another one that is in the danger zone.<br /><br />Of course, this is just my opinion, maybe those will be your favorites. That's the danger in an album with such a wide variety. I would say preview all and buy the songs you like. If I had done this, I would have saved myself a few bucks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is sooo much fun. love it. it helps pass time when you are bored or watcking the kids. I play this for hours on end.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible App. Having the Bible on my Kindle makes it really easy to read my Bible without carrying the big book around. And, there is different plans you can sign up to help you through different situations.<br /><br />I love this App...  :-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have been researching calculators on here and this one wins by far! great job!!!! works well with the kindle fire
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This is a waste of my time. I could not link up my Facebook account to it. I will stick with Draw Something on my Droid Razor. I know it works there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very impressed with the Wool Omnibus.  The stories were relatively unique, the writing was gripping and the revelations even better.  This was a page turner (I read it cover to cover in 2 days.  You won't be able to put this down and while it closes very satisfactorily, it leaves you wanting to learn more about the Wool universe.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I was introduced to The Lunineers from their \\"Ho Hey\\" performance on Conan, where they effortlessly conveyed a very cool folk vibe.  Within seconds, I knew I would be Spotifying them the following morning, and after only a couple tracks, I bought the album. Their hand-clapping, foot-stomping sound is fun and refreshing, similar to David Wax Museum though with less of a Latin influence.
0439023483|5.0|Like so many books that garner a lot of attention in the media, I had some reservations about the trilogy - but, after finishing at least this first one, I have to say that the book deserves the attention it has received! I'm actually really glad that I started reading these books!<br /><br />It is rather dark for a Young Adult novel, but then again, it fits in the dystopian fiction sub-genre, which by nature tends to run towards the dark and depressing. And the Hunger Games themselves add a sort of reality TV flair to the book, which will be familiar to many readers, and make for an interesting element in a novel. The futuristic and fancy technology will capture a lot of interest, as well, I would imagine.<br /><br />But the book's real strength lies with its characters, and the relationships between those characters. As they grow and develop throughout the book, the brutality of the dystopian world is lightened by the surprising tenderness in these relationships. I can't wait to continue on with the series!
B006WPSQVC|5.0|The world needs more movies like this one! Every father should watch, learn and live what this movie says. I plan on buying one for each of my children.
0439023513|4.0|For a series that started out so strongly, I have to admit that I was disappointed in this concluding volume of the trilogy. At first, I loved it - it opens right up where Catching Fire ends, and it was easy to be swept into the exciting plot. But by the end, I just did not find it to be a satisfying conclusion. The relationships failed to develop in as convincing of a fashion - and Peeta's actions were particularly horrifying. Gale's role did not end the way I expected it to and as for Prim... well there was certainly nothing satisfying about that!  The villains' roles were downplayed in this last volume when they should have been stressed and not so surprisingly lackluster.<br /><br />But, the series as a whole was a lot of fun to read, and I am certainly glad that I read them! I am looking forward to the upcoming movies, as well!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It's  awsome!  It's  like I'm an English settler and I studdied a lot about them its great! The. one negitive thing about it is that it's always nagging me to play it but I love it!!!!!!!!! ;)
0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this sequel - and had quite a hard time putting it down! Unlike the first book, I really did not know what to expect in this second installment, and I have to say that I found the plot to be much more exciting and unpredictable that I imagined it would be. It was genuinely nerve-wracking to read and unexpectedly emotional, too! I enjoyed every page of it!<br /><br />The relationships and the love triangle that Katniss finds herself in are so well-drawn and realistic feeling! Gale and Peeta are strong characters and her relationships with both of them are complex and layered. Collins has created three very sympathetic characters, and I think readers will feel just as torn as Katniss.<br /><br />That cliffhanger of an ending certainly has caused me to be very thankful that I already have the last book ready and waiting to be opened! I can't imagine having to wait between publication dates!
0345803485|1.0|I don't get it! With the amount of attention online, on TV and in the media in general you would think this is the first Erotic series written since Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty stories. First and foremost, this author is NOT a very talented writer. I adore Erotica and Romantica and It saddens me that real, quality authors such a MEGAN HART do not receive the same publicity. Fifty Shades of Grey bored me! If you are really interested in good erotica and not just media backed hum drum, I encourage you to seek out those writers who may not get talked about on The View but who truly wriite exciting, sexy, passionate, thought provoking books.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining look at the guilded past.  Interesting view of the class struction of the early 20th Century. Loved it.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead has a strong, clear voice that is uniquely suited to this style of  jazz. This is a great album to relax with,  have as background music or even for singing along in your car. It has a great mix of slow and upbeat songs. I can't believe that someone so young could have such a confident style about her. This album is thoroughly enjoyable and has been a fantastic find.
1883398088|4.0|Short version: great for fans of the series, but the book could have been higher quality. It's really sort of a shame to see a paper-bound art book. I deducted a star largely because it doesn't seem like the thing will endure.<br /><br />The book contains a variety of sketches and concept images, as well as journal entries detailing HR Giger's frustrations and fascinations during the creative process of developing Alien's Alien. A variety of insights into how the sets and \\"characters\\" were constructed shed light on Giger's role in shaping one of the most unique science fiction worlds, from a visual standpoint, ever created. You can see the sets under construction as piles of bone or plasticine models, as well as the derelict ship which appears to play a prominent role in the upcoming Prometheus.<br /><br />There are constant allusions to the role producers and creative partners played in limiting the scope of what Giger wanted to accomplish with the character, while also providing humorous insights into the little victories he won along the way. It's insider-y without focusing too heavily on the commercial realities of movie-making in the late 70's, but interesting tidbits like Giger's accommodation in a hotel the Stones had been through is amusing. The focus is always on how Giger visualized and worked on his art, from his perspective.<br /><br />A must-have if you're a fan of the series; less so if you're merely curious.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had to go back and rerate some of my earlier books.  I picked this book up because it was getting so much recognition.  I got halfway through it and realized I could not close this book without having the other two books to pick up, so I bought both of them.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the characters and storyline. I would encourage anyone to read these books.  I just wish I had three more waiting for me to read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Started the first book out of curiosity. It was a fast read and interesting. There didn't seem to be a complex story plot however. Second book started to delve more into Christian and his proclivities. The final book had more of a plot. This trilogy is interesting, casual reading that shows you a place you may never go on your own. If you blush easily do not read the books in a public place. I would recommend them for a fun read.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|While the book is \\"engaging\\" and has all the components of \\"good literature\\" I have to say that I think such stories are counter productive and even harmful to our society.<br /><br /> I just finished reading the trilogy. While I read, I noticed I was moody and gloomy and just wanted to cry because of the darkness, the cruelty, the coldness and the horrors these people endured nonstop. WHAT IS THE FASCINATION with this kind of literature? No wonder young people, who seem drawn to this stuff, are so unhappy.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a \\"good\\" book, but personally, I think it further serves to demoralize and discourage the souls who are attracted to such darkness.  Maybe that's the point.<br /><br />My advice to them, if they want to feel better, is to stop reading this kind of stuff, especially to the exclusion of all else, and seriously! You don't think that similar video games are affecting your mind? Your mind is what you feed it!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book was so poorly written it was unreadable. It's as if Landay had never heard of an editor--somebody to tell him that he didn't need to describe every single physical detail of the son's room, or every word the main character said to his wife, ever. (Oh my GOD, the inane conversations over the breakfast table or in bed--it was like a transcript of his life, not a novel.) It all made for an excruciatingly boring read.
B005Y4241K|5.0|This is a fantastic concert and I have watched it too many times to count. I have showed this concert to many people and they have all throughly enjoyed it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is a really cool concept. The graphics are cool and the weapons and special powers make the game even more exciting. The only drawback I have is, is the difficulty in obtaining gold during the game other than that I really enjoy this game.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I got this for my Peg Perego Si stroller.  The bottle holder it included was pretty useless and I like having a place to stick a drink, my phone and keys!  This easily attached and I don't even have to remove it to collapse the stroller.  It has plenty of space for water or coffee and it stands upright so I don't worry about my beverages spilling.  This works great for me and is a wonderful price!
0783225733|5.0|these gents got a pass with the incredible staff and ingenious collaboration of so many men and perhaps women at that time, hey they took care of business as well... I could never imagine such a feat of triumph of human spirit and ingenuity to overcome such odds and found this film beyond expectations for brimming with strength and positive emotion.... this is a true story and think that we should focus on our ability to transcend such horrors with confidence to achieve goals that supercede expected outcomes... one of the finest films to demo this spirit to date!! mega mega recommend
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I turned off all notifications because play this game daily. my kindle does not leave my side. but I still get a notification for no reason about 10 minutes after I run out of energy and stop playing. it is very annoying and I hope it is fixed soon so I can rate 5 instead of 3
B00007BKVC|4.0|i could care less about the evils performed by these women, I just wanna see Brad n Gina... yes I am desperate for entertainement so run off a cliff and die, I don't give a flyin fajita... love this film for the revenge to slime f' men n have met tooo many in my life, so will skip that discussion n go for the fun parts... thank u for such diverion in film!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love it  its like super Mario bros. but a leperchaun. no powers. if u like super Mario then I hilghly recommend it to u
0345803485|1.0|This book is way way over-hyped. The writing is bad, the characters are unbelievable and the sex scenes aren't that hot. If you have nothing else to do and someone loans you the book, give it a try but otherwise really not worth reading.
B002PN3J9E|5.0|This product is very informative and enlightening. It was very helpful in teaching me how I learn and what it does internally. Highly recommend this product!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|-<br />ok. fun I' m running out of words to say. I love it so much .  SAVE THE POLAR BEARS!!!!!!  this game is cool.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plain and simple solotare. Looks very good on galaxy note screen. May be a little harder 2 use on a smaller screen though.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|I say this as someone who is an avid fan of the older music. Much of the old band members have passed on though and I'm glad they haven't tried to carbon copy the old style when they don't have the personnel to do it. Instead they have modernized and really developed a nice niche with this new album. It's got a great message and the music is well written. I'm impressed.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed playing it. cute story line and varying levels of mini games. you HAVE to get this game!
B00318COS4|5.0|I'm very particular about the games I like. No violence, mentally challenging but not impossible, lots of random eye candy to keep me amused. This has all of that and more to boot. Excellent game!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|The Sins of the Father (Clifton Chronicles 2) is a book not unlike Kane & Abel previously written by Jeffrey Archer some years ago.  It is a great read and very hard to put down until the very end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a bad game.  none of mini games entertains you for a long period of time but will keep you busy for a few minutes per game.  I really like games where you unlock stuff too so unlocking new games to play is what keeps me playing.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I had to force myself to read this to the end.  The way she ended this saga is really no suprise, as I am sure it opens the door to a book series about Jacob and Reneeesme. My only hope is that she is a better character than Bella.  I could not wait for Bella to get hers in the end, but alas my hopes were dashed.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|After watching the coming attractions, I was anxious to purchase the DVD. To my surprise, I was quite pleased with every aspect of what a good movie should be and this one was well-worth the purchase. Based on a true story, the lead characters, Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum fit the roles to perfection. The viewer could understand the trauma of the impact of an accident as described and in many ways can relate to such horror if it happened to you, a friend, or a loved one. At times, I felt deep sorrow for what Rachel had to go through, and very sorry for what Channing had to do to show his compassion. This movie is one incredible romance with no flaws from beginning to end, and there are hundreds of romance movies out there that simply cannot compete. There are moments you will laugh, moments you will cry, and moments of deep emotion you cannot forget. The acting is superb, the plot is excellent, and it tugs at the heartstrings! Most important, the definition of True Love shines throughout. Highly recommended for all romance lovers, and for all those seeking a movie with inspiration in a good love story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is fun and you get all types of hams and they are like levels so they get harder
B002LITSE8|5.0|If you are a fan of the vampire genre, read on. If you enjoy scifi, read on. If you are post-apocalyptic stories like Cormac McCarthy's The Road, read on. This book is so broadly appealing it almost defies genre. I found myself enjoying the occassional prose, the action, the thought-provoking nature of the book and many other features.<br /><br />As others noted, this book holds up well so many years later. Not much seems dated or stylistically out of place.<br /><br />Some of the images in the book were almost heart-breakingly haunting; the smoke column from the mass-burial pyre for example. Using multiple angles such as the former commuting buddy and of course the main character's wife, Matheson certainly made a play for our emotions.<br /><br />I found this book recommended in a list of post-apocalyptic fiction including Earth Abides, The Postman, Lucifer's Hammer and others. While The Postman was good, I am Legend was easily the best of the bunch. Only The Road is an equal.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This Blu-Ray version of Lonesome Dove is a clear up-grade from the DVD version. I will look forward to many more viewings in the next few years.
B0061S073A|5.0|I use this so my 2 year old can use my fire. It works great. The only problems are when she clicks on ads in apps or if she turns it off and then on again.
B00633W614|4.0|So, we have to wait for Book Three of the trilogy to find out what's going on. Some critics do not like this considering it a writer's gimmick to get more money. It may be the case, who does not need money?<br /><br />I am, however, very happy to know that (if he stayes alive) Jeffrey Archer is going to publish more stuff. To me he inherited the great tradition of English satire, Jonathan Swift comes first to mind. His writing is actually considerably lighter than a lot of other satirical works, he somehow knows how to make even the worst villains almost nice.<br /><br />The war stories (Archer's speciality) are bit absurd and the surviving Eisenhowers may take exception on one of them. Some descendents of German Field Marshals may not like to read about a fictitious marshal in a WWII episode either.<br /><br />As far as I know, Archer prefers to write about the past - issues seemed to be more simple then than they appear now. His pacifist views of WWII, however, are not quite credible, it was, after all, probably the last Just War (on the part of all allied nations to become (Dis)United Nations).<br /><br />I just found Archer is 'only' 72, six years younger than I. So, it is a good chance that another trilogy (trilogies) will be published. This reader cannot wait - at some point I may switch to audio books if my eyesight fades faster than my hearing.<br /><br />So much better than California crime stories!

B00835B1PC|3.0|two readers feel the below may contain spoilers so proceed with that notice,<br /><br />amazon doesn't allow us to give half stars but that is what the grade should be, 3.5 stars.<br /><br />well, i'd watched DH all along so couldn't say no to watching its final season, to see how everyone ended up.  i wish i had been able to stop at edie's death, when the show finished being first rate, but i was weak.  i can't imagine why you would want to see this season if you hadn't seen the prior seven seasons.  it will make no sense if you attempt to do so.  so i assume everyone is like me, hanging in there to see how it turns out.  if you decide to satisfy your curiousity, watching it here on amazon instant viewing is a pretty easy way to take in the resolution.  some of the highlights are as follows.<br /><br />lynette and tom are still separated.  tom is dating a new woman and the issue becomes whether he will make a life with her or go back to lynette. susan faces the biggest life changes of all. incredibly, she and julie come together in shared goals. carlos and gabby have to struggle with some drinking problems and career changes.  plus gabby's past surfaces with a vengenance.  but they stilll remain a very strong couple. bree finds herself fighting a murder charge and love looms large for her via her criminal defense lawyer.  her second husband orson also reappears in her life again for awhile, still the same creep he's always been.<br /><br />i guess the major thing that went AWOL was the smart, snappy writing in this show.  as the writing went down to soap opera level, you had to take it or leave it at that level.  it may be DH's weakest season, but if you want to see how it all turns out for them, this is the season which resolves all issues.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I've just finished reading the Hunger Games Trilogy on my Kindle Fire. I ensured that I read through Book One: The Hunger Games before viewing the film adaptation in theatres. I strongly encourage you to read the novel first, as the film rushes along the ending and a few key points are left out, but I don't want to give anything away. In my opinion the film was good, but the book it much better.<br /><br />Let's consider this series to be a little older than Young Adult due to the sometimes graphic violence, but sexual themes are kept to a minimum. For sci-fi/fantasy, romance and action/thriller enthusiasts of any age, I think this series is a must read. The story increases in complexity as the series continues, but you can become so wrapped into the characters that it didn't through me off to much, but sometimes it was difficult to separate the parts that weren't meant to be reality (i.e. nightmares, flashbacks, etc.).
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|First of all, this isn't a collection of games: It's just one sample game and the engine framework for playing the rest of the games. You can either order the other games a la carte, or you can buy the whole shebang for $9.99.<br /><br />So first about the free framework:<br /><br />The implementation of the Atari console on the Kindle Fire is outstanding. The menu system is strong and the controls are very intuitive.<br /><br />The game pack:<br /><br />I wanted to pick just a couple of games, but then I decided it would make more sense for me just to buy the whole pack of games. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, some of these games are awful and never should have been made. But they're from the 70s/80s. What should we expect? Seeing these older games is actually more like a history lesson than anything else. It shows us just how far we've come. On the other hand, some of these games are true masterpieces. Centipede is timeless! And the implementation of Centipede on the Kindle Fire is outstanding. It's very very cool to be able to bust out my Kindle and play any of these games from the past.<br /><br />I love 'em!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is Well written novel with lots of twists - Easy page turner and a great read for anyone looking for a good suspense novel.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I got the 2 disk set from the library and was as happy with the film as when I saw it in theaters. I'm glad I did not pay retail for the special edition, though! It has interesting facts, some creative insights, pre production art stills, and due credit given to the tiawanese crew member who contributed priceless cultural experience.<br /><br />I am not saying the second disk is bad, but it's not worth double the cost of the movie disk alone. I would have liked more depth about China, it's landscapes, buildings, and morals/values ... these were very briefly addressed, probably because the target audience is kids.<br /><br />I plan to buy the film for my collection. It's an overcomer theme that has a happy ending, like classic bedtime stories do. Not a fan of \\"sophisticated\\" plots and \\"grey\\" morality like newer stories present. I want clear cut good and evil, honorable heroes, wise leaders, and realistic emotions. Mulan has all of this. I recommend it for kids, and parents - homeschoolers in particular will find a lot to talk about afterwards.<br /><br />Unlike many films, it isn't stereotyped at all. It is not \\"feminist\\", \\"patriarchal\\", or any other \\"ism\\". Yay!<br /><br />Mulan makes hard choices and follows through them, despite personal risk. Such strength of character and love for others - social responsibility towards your family/troop/country - has largely disppeared from American culture. So sad! I hope quality media like this will inspire future leaders to have honor and courage as adults, to stand for their convictions, if not stand up to Huns.<br /><br />The negative was Mushu, the little dragon. I found him annoying more than funny, especially when he causes Mulan awkward, embarrassing situations - with no apology. Repeatedly. I don't enjoy watching others put in painful situations. He detracts from the cultural context - I think Khan should have trampled him some more! Good horse.<br /><br />Artistically, look at the character creation bonus feature and the stills. Rewatch the film. You will get a different perspective and sense of the Chinese quality to the art. For example, the horse Khan, is very angular with large body and very thin legs, emphasizing strength and grace.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have just begun reading the Nicholas Sparks novels (I know, I'm the last to know) and this might be my favorite so far. I loved everything about it... can't wait to see the movie now!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit I had first seen the movie before reading the book, but I must tell you the book is much richer and depth. It's full of details and descriptions. You'll really feel the despair of the inhabitants of the 12 District. It's pointless to go on further details regarding the story, but I can tell it's great how the author described this futuristic American society and the struggle between the different districts. Finally, don't think this is another teenager's book, this is actually a mature and violent story, with a great background and ambience. Two thumbs up and more for this one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was fast and easy to download. I will continue to buy books off of here to be used on my iPad.

B00723NWJE|5.0|Back in 2001 I assisted a then-friend of mine in a mission that I'v'e since realized could be classified as stalking. He a hip-hop producer and me a music dweeb with a few connections. When said friend gained intel about an unknown - but super good looking - young woman who had been signed to Blue Note Records (a label whose catalog hip-hop producers often sample from), we figured out the details of her then-low-key life and, through my connections at work, scored a ticket to a very small show said woman was playing in New York. The woman in question, a young pianist/singer named Norah Jones who was supposedly the illegitimate daughter of Ravi Shankar, would be a huge star in only months. Within a year of my friend's mission to court Jones (he planned to not only date Jones, but also work with her), she would be the hottest young artist on the planet, her debut, Come Away with Me, selling over 20 million copies and winning every award under the sun.    Though the song that made Jones, \\"Don't Know Why,\\" still plays often in the bright alleys of grocery stores worldwide, Norah isn't the household name she once was. She's made a handful of records since that major 2002 hit, but hasn't done particularly well with critics or fans, losing steam with each release since. It's not that Jones isn't talented - she has an incredible voice, no doubt - but rather that she's never been able to find her true fan base. The \\"Don't Know Why\\" fans weren't the type to follow artists through the fire but, rather, the type to buy the two or three records each year that featured the two or three songs they heard the most on the radio. And so Jones, a reasonably hip young artist (despite what her early fame may suggest), has slowly been working her way away from the adult contemporary genre and into, she hopes, the hearts of today's younger, hipper listener. Along the way she's collaborated with Outkast, Q-Tip, Foo Fighters, Talib Kweli and even Belle & Sebastian and Ryan Adams, the later of which she's worked with extensively - most notably on last year's excellent Ashes & Fire.    Somewhere along the way Jones got a call from producer Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton, asking her to work on last year's little-heard Spaghetti Western themed art record, Rome. Jones worked as the featured vocalist on Burton's passion project, along the way establishing a working relationship with the producer that eventually led to talks of a larger, more collaborative project. Almost immediately the two artists ended up writing and producing Little Broken Hearts together towards the end of 2011. And so now we have the by-far-coolest 12 songs in the Jones canon. Rather than relying on Jones' usual voice-and-piano setup, Burton and Jones here start anew, offering up a soulful pop record that easily fits in with most of the indie releases of the day. More Fesit than Etta. More dark than sad. Burton here works as mood master, helping to turn Jones' big vocal ability into a cinematic wash of pop and soul that is convincingly cool. Hypnotic and sex, even, rather than stuffy and smooth.    Featuring Burton's usual thick, studio-dusty sound, Little Broken Hearts plays through with a surprising amount of diversity and consistency. I hear three hit singles and another five or six new naptime classics. \\"Happy Pills,\\" the record's lead single, feels like Jones' best bet at a bit hit since that one song while \\"Miriam\\" begs us to believe that Jones was paying  a whole lot of attention when in the studio with Ryan Adams for his Ashes record. Track one, \\"Good Morning,\\" is another favorite, feeling almost like an opening plea by Jones to be taken seriously by serious listeners. \\"Say Goodbye\\" is another standout, having all the qualities of a great second single. Easily Jones best work yet, Little Broken Hearts is a good holdover record until Fiona Apple's long awaited - and surely classic - fourth album comes out this summer. But it's more, too. Broken Little Hearts is proof that Norah Jones is able to write for more critical, more passionate listeners; and she's able to do so with an almost remarkable consistency.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the 2nd book in the series and I enjoyed the suspense.  I have read all three books before we saw the 1st installment movie and found it verry detailed.  It kept my interest throughout my read.
B00753MBHA|5.0|This picks up where Blood of Nations left off.  Great new material to add to classic metal collection.  It's great that some 80s bands are still making great hard rock.  Go see them in concert too - old Udo songs sound great with Mark at the helm.
B007JUWM64|2.0|The most enjoyable moments and best acting in this movie were the brief ones with Planchet. The rest of the movie was just mind-numbing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This books was recommended reading by a co-worker. Although I found the storyline was interesting, it was a little to erotic for my taste.  I would not recommend this book to others.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|This is the best show I have seen in awhile. The actors, storyline, scenery, etc are all completely amazing! I was expecting a dull British drama, but boy was I wrong. Never a dull moment at Downton Abbey!! I am eager for season 3!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First two books were amazing, but this one was a little confusing at some parts, and the ending seemed rushed. I thought the ending was boring and as I read I expected more. Parts of the story were left hanging out there, with no explanation or follow up. Just left me disappointed and with a \\"that's it?\\" feeling.
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|This book will definitely be more appreciated by the die hard PKD fans who are familiar with both his work and his personal life. This book approaches one of Dick's most recurring problems: what is real and how do we know? What the casual reader may not know is that for Dick this problem wasn't a literary exercise, apparently he really had trouble distinguishing reality, so this book, like the others, is most of all a fascinating tour of a disturbed mind. Unfortunately some of his problems manifest themselves in his writing, which can be quite disorganized. Ubik starts being about this future world of telepathic espionage and supernatural gifts only to take a sharp turn in a completely different direction before you know it. Those who appreciate PKD for what he is, warts and all, won't be too upset and will obediently follow the author in whatever ride he has in store for them. And quite a ride it is! A ride in a reality that is as fragile and ephemeral as a cardboard movie set (remember those? Before CG?), a constantly changing reality that more often than not makes little sense to both the characters and the reader. There is, of course, some kind of resolution to the mystery, which may not be a resolution at all, and not all readers may appreciate it.<br />All in all, I disagree with those who call this Dick's best book, it is enjoyable but not his best. The characters are terrible, the story is schizophrenic and disorganized with the distinct feeling the author started it without knowing where he was going to go with it. But as always with PKD, the basic ideas are fascinating and entertaining and the quirks of the future he never fails to pepper his books with are clever and slightly unsettling in their plausibility.

0345803485|5.0|I made a feeble attempt to read erotica many years ago, but it was so cheesy and lame, I couldn't get past the first few pages.  So, a few weeks ago, a friend recommended Fifty Shades to me, not mentioning it was erotica.  I have to say, this trilogy will set the bar for any future erotica I may read.  It was so well-written that I look forward to any future works by E L James, erotica or not.  I love her style of writing and how she infuses each character with traits that anybody can identify with.  It keeps the characters from becoming cheesy and absurd.  This having been my first time reading erotica, I was a little bored with all the sex, sex, sex (and hoping for more of a plot other than 'which position next?'), so I was happy to reach book III of the series when there was more of a plot and more twists and turns in the story.  As it turned out, I thought the entire trilogy was engrossing from beginning to end and I liked how the author wrapped it up.  Excellent, excellent writing.  I have already recommended the Fifty Shades trilogy to many friends.
B004FOA84A|5.0|seemed short as I was so engrossed with it! the puzzles were challenging, but not insanely difficult. great game! I want more like this!
0143119680|4.0|I have to admit that I am a fan of the vampire genre and although this book was formulaic in its set up, there was an interesting derivation with the other fantasy characters that get introduced.<br />It kept my interest even at its length with a cast of characters I came to care about. My only real disappointment was the ending, or lack thereof. I get that this was written<br />as a trilogy, but I didn't know that when I started and I feel there could have been something a bit tidier at the end.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game. kind of like the sims but with the ice age characters. lots of fun and addictive. good for adults and the kids
B0073PZIYI|2.0|My wife and I both were interested in the premise of this movie, but were extremely disappointed in it. The concept is okay, I guess, but the script is silly and the characters in the movie don't react at all like they would in \\"real life\\". The whole movie was strange and more than a little corny. We regret watching it and definitely regret paying $3.99.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|A post-Fifty read for me. I enjoyed it. Would love to read some more about Gideon and Eva. More please! I purchased mine for Kindle.

B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are great.  I like that there are no batteries I have to switch out.  They are better than my fancy 300 speaker set.  I can go get a snack and still hear what is going on.  Wish I bought these a long time ago.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|For me, this was a sturdier, more stylish Kindle cover compared to my previous one.  I liked that it had plastic clasps (inside the cover) to firmly snap the Kindle Fire in, and keep it sturdily in place (unlike my old cover which had elastic straps). The clasps ensure that the device won't fall out while you're reading, or fall down, unlike my old cover.<br /><br />It's a beautiful, deep red cover (a little warmer and brighter in tone than a cherry red). It's not a \\"smooth\\" cover, but instead has striations within the red... When carrying it about, the cover makes your kindle look like you're carrying about a stylish journal to write in, rather than a device like the Kindle Fire. It's easy to stand in order to watch films.<br /><br />One small quibble I have with this product was that the clasp used to close the cover is an elastic band (rather it would have been magnetic, but that might have taken away from the aesthetic appeal of the cover). Another thing I didn't like is that the brand name of the cover is also stamped on the front of the cover too. These, of course, are just a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a really, really nice stand/ cover for Kindle Fire.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm a little older and the idea of a virgin being exposed to this \\"lifestyle\\" just was boring.  The writing didn't impress me or the story or the characters.  I didn't finish it but was intrested in what America considers great litterature.  Now I know and it saddens me.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Works perfectly when I need it. Easy to use and simple to navigate. Clean and quick and works on any machine or network. Thanks!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found 50 Shades of Gray interestingly written. I also thought it was repetitive in its descriptions of their frenzied and constant sex. Not even fictional characters have sex as much as these two. Ana should have serious UTI issues given the frequency and bizarre things he does to her \\"va jay jay\\" parts. Christian on the other hand...although a young man surely must be on Viagra given the sheer number of times on any given day he screws her. Not saying it can't happen...I just found it unlikely. But again...interesting read.
B004LROMQG|5.0|NEW The Merlin series aired on NBC 3 or 4 years ago and I really like the new concept. Then it was gone which isn't anything new. Later I noticed it had returned to Sy-Fi station and was really happy to see it being shown again. It is a really cool way to tell the story of King Arthur's court from a completely different perspective and my family and I love the characters and the story telling is just plain awesome.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|At first i was not going to get any protection, but when i saw this on a lightning offer the price persuaded my to rethink. Like others have noted it DOES provide a great sense of protection as it has a hard plastic enclosed attachment to the fire.<br />One thing it really needs is a place to hold the amazon stylus. i have fumble fingers and once i used the stylus there is no going back to the time wasting 3rd or 4th try with my fingers so i now use the stylus for everything.<br />This case has no wiggle room for that. so i can imagine myself loosing the stylus.<br /><br />Case would be a 5 star if it just had a little place for the stylus. if you are NOT using a stylus then why spend more on a case for the fire? This case fits the bill just fine.[[ASIN:B005V2EVBQ Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Black]]

B006B9F6CQ|4.0|Being a fan of Britney Spears that never had the finances needed to see her in live in concert, I was overjoyed when this DVD was announced. I saved up extra to buy the special edition including the remix CD. But I was a little disappointed by how everything was handled with this release.<br /><br />First of all, let's address the elephant in the room: Britney's dubbed vocals. It's no secret that Brit Brit (dare I say) dabbles in lip synching, but judging by YouTube videos of this tour, she actually sang live for most of the show (if not all of it). On the DVD, however, EVERY SONG IS DUBBED. Epix released a statement claiming Britney made the decision to do so but I cry foul. Britney can actually sing, so why is she always covering it up?<br /><br />Secondly, this was just shot very badly. There are certain moments when the camera cuts from Britney dancing to some group of people in the audience. Sure, that's all fine and dandy the first couple of times but it happens so often I swear I saw the same group of people three times! Not only that, but the shots of the audience were BLURRY!<br /><br />Thirdly, the DVD menu COMPLETELY typo'd some song names. It's like no one in charge cared about the packaging. (Let's use the album cover AGAIN. Maybe they'll use it for her next album too?)<br /><br />And a fourth critique is a small one: WHO IN THE NAME OF LIZA MINELLI STYLED BRITNEY'S HAIR??? Seriously, I think I should just call her Weaveny instead.<br /><br />Those points aside, it was amazing to see Britney on top of the world again and it really looked as though she was enjoying herself. If it were any other artist, this would be getting two or three stars but because it's Britney, I'm giving it four.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I finished the whole series in about a week, then I saw the movie (book is, of course, way better), then I started reading the series over again.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire. The Bible is easy to read and it has more than just the King James Version but a large amount of Versions. I prefer the KJV but if I do not understand, I can just look at the Amplified Version. Also very organized.
1883217040|4.0|First, buy the book.  You will get plenty of use out of it, covers a lot of bases!  There are other solid resources available too, including Bert Ligon's wonderful books.<br />What is in this book has been covered in detail and I mainly want to focus my energy on a simple idea that there is some disagreement on - that of READING MUSIC.<br />Most people writing here are coming from the academic, music school mentality, and thus seem to forget the earlier history of where this music has come from.  Before there were music schools, and books on \\"how to play jazz\\", people learned the old fashioned way - by listening, jamming with one another, and absorbing the music organically and somewhat slowly.  Reviewers seem to imply reading music is necessary to play jazz, and I disagree.  I have a performance degree by the way, and I admit that we live in different times than the 1930's, and performance opportunities are much easier to find coming through a school than finding a mentor and learning on the bandstand.  My main point however, is that knowledge of reading music is no shortcut to the tried and true process of taking some risks putting yourself out there, finding gigging musician mentor(s), listening, working hard on honing your craft, jamming with as many folks as you can, and then playing in bands (other peoples, and your own).  Reading music does not do these things for you, but it can sure make it easier, and I highly recommend all jazz musicians to become a competent reader.<br /><br />Having said that much, when it comes to hiring a fellow musician to play with, I am FIRST and FOREMOST looking for someone who has all the basics down, and who is fun to play with.  This means they know a lot of tunes by memory, can transpose on the spot if needed, can improvise on anything, sound good doing it, don't get lost in forms, can HEAR the group and INTERACT.  If they can do all those things, whether they read or not is not really all that important.  That's the honest truth.  Again, learn to read, but make it part of a balanced approach including all the rest of the above.  And just because you can read doesn't make you any better than someone who has outstanding ears and response, but can't read.  If I have a choice between the two, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that 99% of the time I'm picking the guy who can't read, but who knows tunes and can interact.  That will be a fun gig thats happening, rather than an uptight gig, with some music school trained guy who can spit back the information on a page, but is afraid to let go of the real book and look around at each other a little bit.  My honest opinion, don't mean to offend.<br /><br />And here is attatched a few more points I've included from an earlier response I'd written that have merits here as well:<br /><br />The FLUENCY with which one reads music is a measurement which has no bearing upon how well ones musical \\"ear\\" functions.  As much as I'd like to jump in here and fault this reviewer for having been lazy and not learning how to read music, he does have a point.<br /><br />This book - as good as it is - could have included a better means to convey the examples for those who can't yet read well or are in the process of doing so.<br />Why NOT include a CD? I read, but I certainly know when I hear something it clicks almost instantaneously. Tab is out of the question of course, the reviewer would be selfish to expect that in addition to standard notation tab was also given. 1) It would make the book too long, and possibly take away from essential material due to limited space 2) Guitar is an instrument the author doesn't play, and not only that, most jazz musicians do not read tab so its outta the question.<br /><br />BUT, the question remains: WHY NOT INCLUDE A CD? I read piano, and had no prob on the examples, but it would've been just as easy to go to track 13, or 93 for that matter (mp3 cd would be fine) - ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANTED TO STUDY THE BOOK IN A PLACEWHERE A PIANO WAS NOT PRESENT.<br /><br />Besides that though, I will take this argument one step further than I would've had the comments not been so self righteous and off track. JAZZ is in fact and has always been an EAR BASED MUSIC.<br /><br />Many of the originators of this music did not place such a high value on reading as the comments I see here. Some of the guys in Count Basies big band could not read for ex, and alot of the early swing musicians. For those of you acting as if reading is a prerequisite to playing \\"good jazz\\", stop and think: are you going to tell us Erroll Garner wasn't a master? Bix Beiderbecke? Chet Baker? Buddy Rich? Dave Brubeck (until late in his career)? Dennis Chambers? Django Reinhardt? Wes Montgomery?<br /><br />Reading is important no doubt, but its not essential to play jazz. It is one skill of many required to be a musician and there are many great readers who cannot improvise, much less compose their own songs. The Beatles did not read music, and even most jazz musicians will admit they wrote some brilliant compositions. Music comes from ones mind, notation is only but one of the means used to re-create it! Playing by ear / memorization is also a valid and in many ways superior way to learn music. What great jazz musician has not transcribed a ton of music? Certainly the author of this volume, Mark Levine has.<br /><br />When you shut the non-readers (or non piano owners) out of the process it only adds to the \\"holier than thou\\" attitude that unfortunately has become so prevalent in too many of those who play this great music today. I say that with the utmost love and respect for this music, improvising, and as a fan of this book.<br /><br />Do not take my comments the wrong way, this reviewer was wrong to rate a 1 star because of his laziness. However, the sense of righteousness in the comments to follow inspired me to write a comment of my own. I'm a reader and I don't see any reason why everybody who plays jazz should NOT learn how to read. But when we play music, we don't want our faces to be stuck in the real book. Its why Duke Ellington made every member of his big band memorize the song book. Reading music should be essential, but jazz and improvising is an ear based music that comes from listening and interaction.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that while this is a great book and resource, the author missed out on a great opportunity to educate by NOT including a sample cd so the examples could be listened to as well as read.
B0081EDSFQ|4.0|This is my first time purchasing an online video on Amazon.  I'm glad I did. No commercial interruptions. This was a really good episode of House with humorous and sad moments. Chase comes into his own and grows up and out from under Houses' shadow. House shows again what a wonderful, caring friend he really is. He is human.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|We enjoy reading Michael Connelly books. We have read everything he had written to date in the Harry Bosch series and eagerly await more. We have enjoyed his other books as well.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Nice picture for those who aren't going to war to experience it.  Shows cooperation and mutual admiration between your spec ops troop and the line troop.
B006QKKMBA|1.0|Pretty dumb movie. The opening credits lasted half the movie. The writing was terrible. The best part was seeing Jacqueline MacInnes-Wood the roccker chick, who died early in the movie.She was HOT! After the first few movies, it's just the same thing and you knew it was comming. Was not worth renting. If you want to spend your 4 dollars smarter, rent Columbiana Very good movie!!!!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|yyyaaaa it finaly came out. the app store as in like an ipod touch or iphone is differnt then the amazon app store like on my cruz tablet. so sad :( but yess they put this game out!!! :D
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|do not know if i like it better or not as much as house of the devil but there is my point. If you liked house of the devil than you will like this. If you didn't like House than move in. Regardless, it is a good independent horror film. beats most horror hollywood puts out nowadays.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good game had to start over it froze. and it was frustrating.  but going to trying again<br />otherwise good game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If pages were torn out of A Tale of Two Cities, 1984, and the fourth Harry Potter book, and then sorted and pasted together, I think the result might be something like The Hunger Games.<br /><br />While no definitive year is given in the story, it seems clear that this is some kind of post-apocalyptic society, in which the ruling class seizes control of the country and keeps its citizens under control with harsh intimidation tactics and scarce resources (a la \\"1984\\"). To add insult to injury, selected children are forced to compete to the death in the annual Hunger Games (something reminiscent of the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, except there can only be one winner). Meanwhile, the wealthiest place bets and enjoy the \\"sport\\" of watching the kids brutally kill each other (kinda like the guillotine bloodbath in \\"Two Cities\\").<br /><br />I will say this, Suzanne Collins is a master of creating suspense. She knows how to move the plot. Her writing style is fairly simple, but she describes scenarios well enough.<br /><br />However, while this may be labeled a \\"young adult\\" book, be warned before you read it: It's not sweet and happy. It is gory and gruesome and, frankly, I read the whole thing and STILL can't wrap my head around the idea of teenagers killing each other for sport. If you don't think you can handle that, don't waste your time. There are no warm, fuzzy feelings to be found here.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I love books and I love Vampires and finally I have found an author who has made reading awesome again. This was a book I did not want to end. Hamilton's thoughtful attention to detail as well as her accuracy in describing the wiccan beliefs proves that she loves what she is doing and we are lucky that she is doing it. The Forever Girl is by far the best book that I have had the pleasure to read in a very long time. My only question is when is the next book coming out? I can't wait. Thank you Rebecca for writing such a wonderful story.<br />Lisa Crowe
B006E2VTG2|5.0|I really liked this movie. Solid story, acting and an awsome character. movie was like a Nikita, was very cool. and she was pretty hot too!
B0058VW36U|4.0|It is a very simple game, that's why its so popular.The synopsis of it is to cut a rope and aim the sweet treat into om noms mouths.but wait....its not that easy,the ropes are swinging,spikes are waiting for your treat to land on them,there are bubbles wanting to take your treat to outer space, and etc.This game makes the mind think!I believe its better than angry birds in the it challenges your mind,its not as graphic as angry birds but it is more challenging.So if you like puzzles and things of that nature and want something to add toyour app collection.Get this game,get it!
B000QUCNOU|5.0|My personal favorite Fincher flick. Definitely worth buying this. Once I get the money, however, I will be buying the BluRay just to have the extra features. This film is not as easy to find as others so no matter what format, I recommend picking it up.
0345803485|3.0|This book is terribly written, yet I cannot put it down. It's like Michele Bachmann. I love/hate her. I love/hate this book, and I will most likely buy the second and third and love/hate them as well. That is all.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Awesome.  I just like her voice.  She is wonderful. I am glad that I grew up with that voice now I know what great singing is.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A very good read, If only three quarters of the book is true it shows the inhumanity of the North Koreans. It makes you wonder why China defends this country.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Very Solid movie. Well written. Nice fight scenes, Great actors. It was around 2 hours, but the story kept u involved through out. Robert Downey is and always will be one of the great actors of our time, no matter what script he can pull it of!!! I would recomend this movie, well worth the couple dollars it is to rent!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game every body should have this game if u dnt you dnt no what u missn
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was lengthy but that was a good thing because there is so much to absorb and LOVE its soo good and intense and funny and just a greatread for any girl interested in escaping the real world full of lame guys and enter the world of Travis lol
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|We've all heard the story of Chicken Little who thought the sky was falling but come to find out it was only an acorn that bonked him on the head.  In this new adaptation of the movie, there are aliens involved and a wonderful crew of characters that just keep my son laughing throughout the entire movie.  The relationship between Chicken Little and his father is sweet also.  His father doesn't know how to treat a son who is nothing like him, but he realizes that love and support are what his son really needs from him.  My son is 4 and loves this movie so much!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I want more of Mr. Grey!!  I did like how we finally got to read his thoughts at the end of the book.  I could have read some more from his point of view.  All in all I loved the trilogy and I cannot wait for the movie to come out.
0345803485|5.0|Before I even made it halfway through this book, I was on Amazon ordering the two sequels. True, not the best written book, but it sucked me in and didn't let go until I finished all three! Well worth $10 for sure.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|What do i say, well, Vin Diesel, he is the new Arnold! He has been for awile. mind the spellin. You want action VIN is the man! Vin Diesel that is, the movie is worth watchin and tellin everyone about!. More than worth the rental!. great movie Vin and THE ROCK were well worth it! Rent it!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had no problems at all running this app and its great for passing wait times. Love custom background option too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For years I have not felt the desire to sit and read a book. Frankly I think there are more appealing activities I could engage in during my free time. This series however was so completely captivating. Addictive to the point that all three books were read within 4 days. I just could not put it down. Eat, Shower, Read was my routine. Sleep was very limited. However this book was not a masterpiece. I could have definitely done without the repetitious phrases such as \\"presses his lip in a hard line\\", \\"pants hang off his hips, in that way\\" and the list continues. Diversity madam author. Please!! Also I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic sexual details, in fact I welcomed them, however if you are going to have sex with someone 3 or 4 times in a day I really don't need the details for all of them. Valuable time I thought could have been spent focusing on plot development. And does every sex scene have, to have her orgasm and both releasing at the same time. Really??? Sounds more like fairytale rather than reality. Would have also loved to have seen Ana progress much much deeper into the BDSM world. She never seemed to have graduated from the minor leagues. Secretly hoped that the epilogue would have reflected such a change....her increased tolerance to some severe caning perhaps? Anyway this is sounding more like a dislike of the book rather than a recommendation. Regardless I was able to overlook these and other short comings because of the amazing storyline. It was indeed entertaining. I am saddened to see it over. My \\"Inner God\\" would call for a fourth book if I didn't think it would do more harm than good.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved this book.  I was captivated from the very beginning.  E L James really knows how to keep the heat up.  I am actually reading it again to make sure I did not miss a thing.  I have recommended it to some friends who have found it equally captivating.
1400031001|5.0|Any Human Heart follows the protagonist, Logna Mountstuart, from his Oxford days to his death in 1991 at the age of 85. We learn of his adventures through the pages of his journal. Through is own private musings, we watch as he yearns for adulthood, sex - a major focus throughout his life - and fame as a writer. He achieves all these things and more, thanks to his talent and good fortune. But what life gives him, \\"bad luck\\" takes away. Over the period of seven decades, we share in this articulate, passionate writer's highs and lows - a pamorama of life lived to the very last breath. Because LMS crosses paths with many legends from the literary and art worlds, I found myself believing that Logan Mountstuart wasn't just the product of a very creative imagination. It made me half sad that he hadn't been a flesh and blood man, for I longed to read more about this remarkable character. I highly recommend this book.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Well, um, the story itself was decent. Gosling and Mulligan can act, but were'nt allowed to Because the film must have had an extreamely low budget!! The movie sometimes awkward, very long and drawn out. Very boring. With a better Director and better budget (god i hope they didnt spend alot on it!!!) and some tweeks with the writeing it could have been alot better of a movie.The sound track Sucked, sounded like 70's music really Lousey. The driveing scenes were decent. I was just very disapointed after seeing the trailer then the movie. I really would not recomend this movie to anyone, it was very dissapointing!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great continuation of the story. This one gets very scary in parts. At this point, I've already finished Books 3 and 4 of the series and am ready to buy the 5th, so obviously I rate this series highly.  And just got season 1 of the HBO dvd set!!  Big fan.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|really cool and convenient note taking app. handy to use and free and easy to understand. Really advice kindle users to gt this app.

B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Well, to start with Jason Statham, in my opinion i could see him in other roles besides action, but in action he is always great... And Robert De Niro Was his usual Greatness he is a god as usual even though he was not in it for the full film. The action was great for the action peeps. The story was Great. It was just a solid movie, I loved it!! Another Great movie would be Columbiana, where there are no big actors but it is a very good movie, well worth the rental fee!!!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like this game its fun addicting and kind of challenging I only rated this game 4 stars because every once in a while it restarts and sets me back to the 1st level Wich it kind of sucks but overall its a nice game
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for work and personal organization. The browser web clipper feature is great along with the cloud sync so that I can always access my notes without being restricted to using my main device. it has definitely made me more productive and efficient.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Great product. Looks like a book and will give great protection.Fits the Kindle fie perfectly and will last a long time.
B0076R62FM|1.0|Oh dear. The first Johnny English was ok but it was MUCH better than this very poor attempt. If you only paid $1 for this item you would still feel disappointed.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|One of the best Tim Burton / Johnny Deep movies.  I watched episodes of the original soap opera on DVD, before I went and saw the movie.  It had been since I was in Grade School.  The movie did the soap justice!  I will be buying it on DVD when it comes out.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|This album integrates the folkloric sounds of New Orleans and something new, fresh contemporary BITCHIN!!!! I can't stop listening to it full blast
B004LUS390|3.0|I enjoy the free app a lot bought the upgrade and it will not install. Performed a reboot and no joy. Contacted autodesk Inc and rcv'd no support.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|SvZ isn't easy, but it's bella fun.  Just don't underestimate the power of using a few Free GLU Credits offers to upgrade Leadership -- it really helps!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I bought this product and tried it out on World of Tanks. It worked very well, the ergonomic form is great and feels very comfortable on the hand. The buttons can be easily programed and the little joystick actually works surprisingly well. World of Tanks actually gives some basic information to the LCD display.<br /><br />Handling, functionality, flexibility and ergonomics are clearly 5 stars.<br /><br />BUT, the performance dropped. As soon as I plug the G13 into the USB port, the frame-per-second rate drops by 20-30 points. I normally have between 80-120 FPS and you can test that very easily. Go into the game and plug the G13 in and unplug it after a minute. I could clearly see when pluggin the G13 in and out that the FPS rate drops by 20-30 as listed in real time by WoT. I deactivated the LCD display but I saw the same performance drop. Not sure how other games are affected.<br /><br />I am not willing to take that rate drop, especially when I look long term. I returned the product and am now looking for a different product.
B002WSASIC|1.0|the first and last hd movie I rent from amazon. the movie itself is great, but the quality was awful. the entire movie sounded like an old dragging cassette tape. for $5 I expected better, or my money back!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|game is a lot of fun and my daughter takes it from me so she can play loll. plus its a great way to kill some time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to say that I was amazed with these series of books and I am hook on them.  I will defenitely recommend them and they can be enjoyed by young adults as well as adults.  I just love them and could not wait to purchase the following one in the series.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is an incredible, mystical book. I was mesmerized as I read each page. This is a story that makes you think about what you want in life. I've always been one who believes there are signs that help guide you in the direction you should or should not go. How we, as individuals, interpret those signs is another matter. My only complaint is that I didn't discover and read this book many years ago. I read a library copy of The Alchemist, but will most certainly purchase a copy that I can keep and read again. Thank goodness Paulo Coelho wrote so many books. It will be a grand journey reading them all.
B002ZG98UA|2.0|I've never played the RE video games but watched this out of simple curiosity. The first 8 minutes was completely riveting and stylish. But after Alice left Tokyo the plot and cinematography bored me to death. I just kept waiting for something to really happen but was sorely disappointed. The ending = let down. &#34;Resident Evil Afterlife&#34; stinks!!!
0545405777|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat, asking for more. One of the things I feel that captured myself and a lot of people's attention on this book is the horrible thought that this could actually happen to the United States. Where we are put in districts, and forced to bow to the Capitals wishes. It is definitely scary. Incredible book, and I love the feel and look of this collectable edition!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great and entertaining game. Very addictive to get a better score each time. It's an interesting alternative to other solitaire games.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|The first time I read this I thought it was very wordy with lots of long exposition, but many parts of it stuck with me and I found myself reading it again a few weeks later. The second time around my appreciation of the novel rose considerably. After 5 books, the author had lots of loose ends to tie up, so I understand the drawn out areas that got a little long winded. On the flip side of that, I loved seeing all the characters come together in the end. Well worth the wait.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Somewhat expensive when I purchased it, but read in a review that it will be dropping to $209.  Currently, using an i7 2600K cpu with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO cooler, 16GB's Kingston HyperX 1600MHz (4x4), GeForce 560Ti video card and a Samsung 830 SSD (256GB).  Also have 2 3TB external usb 3.0 hd's attached.  Upgraded from an MSI P67 board.  I set the bios to auto overclock.  Memory is running at 1653MHz and the cpu hits 4.5GHz at times though mainly stays in the 4.3GHz range when transcoding files.  Mostly using the pc for transcoding video files using various software and some light video editing using Nero.  Everything runs pretty smooth.  If I had to make one complaint, even with the ssd, the boot time is a little longer than what I am use to with other pc's using an ssd.  I read in one review that it's due to the number of controllers which need to be initialized (unused controllers should be disabled to speed up boot time).
B00004XPPE|5.0|Failsafe is one of the top 5 sci-fi superpowers war stories. A generals dream becomes his reality and no one is safe in failsafe. With today's technology this movie could actually happen
B001AG52AG|1.0|I really enjoyed the book - a character-driven fantasy/mystery.<br /><br />The movie, on the other hand, decided to essentially ignore the character-driven aspect of the book, and instead went for (and horribly missed) a story-driven epic.<br /><br />If you liked the book, skip this.
1594203334|3.0|This book was a great read about bringing up babies in France and how their methods compare to the US, however I wish it gave a bit more instruction on HOW to try out these methods.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Started a little slow but once you understand the direction it wasn't easy to put down.  Read the trilogy over a weekend.
1594744769|5.0|This is a riveting and very creative novel that my 10-year-old daughter and I both enjoyed. Part fantasy, it is the story of a teenage boy, whose future seems ominous, based on his grandfather's dying words. After a period of depression, a trip abroad turns into a soul-searching adventure full of unexpected twists and turns. A real page-turner.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This movie is for those who love comedy and an alternate reality of the present.<br />A psychopathic general and the possible end of mankind. Peter sellers plays several persons in this great dark humor war story.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|The action was GOOD when there was action. This movies was SLOW. Kinda like playing the game RISK. A whole alot TALKING smh I was disappointed :(
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great. I play it all the time with my friends. I can play with my facebook friends too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game. I like the constant flow of money. Plus the contracts for possting help as well. Provided you have an Internet connection.
0345803485|5.0|I was tempted to read this a while back but decided not to. Well after hearing about it so much on the radio, and from one of my friends, I went out and bought it. I am not a fast reader, and I ended up reading all 3 books in less than a week. It was hard to put down. I would stay up late reading, read before work, on my lunch break, as soon as I got home. I thought the work day would never end. It has a great story line, the erotic parts are very rated \\"R\\". I have told all my friends to read it and about 5 other people at my job are reading it because they could see how into the book I was. If you don't mind the erotic parts you will love this book. I plan to read all 3 books again, very soon!

1451627289|4.0|SPOILERS AHEAD! I very much enjoyed Stephen King's time-travel tale, if a bit longer than it needed to be. The characters and dialogue were fun, as was the trip back to a presumably \\"simpler\\" time. I was even fine with the love story (nice twist at the end). Where King disappointed me was with his buying into Gerald Posner's crock, \\"Case Closed\\", pushing the \\"Oswald was solo\\" pap. In doing so, King, like Posner, brushed off or ignored completely any and all facts that would challenge his Oswald thesis.<br />A few examples: Oswald, a US Marine formerly stationed at a US base in Atsugi, Japan (where the CIA coordinated U2 missions), defects to Russia, loudly renouncing America and promising to tell all he knows. Yet when he changes his mind and returns to America, he is not only NOT arrested or even questioned upon his arrival, but the State Department loans him the money to get home! This at the absolute Red Menace height of the Cold War! But that raises no questions here. Seriously?<br />Neither does the fact that a \\"Lee Oswald\\" test drove a car at high speed in Dallas weeks before the assassination, spouting anti-JFK talk. But the real Oswald didn't drive. Or another \\"Lee Oswald\\" shows up in Mexico clamoring to go to Cuba, but--oops!--US surveillance shows someone else claiming to be Lee. (Hoover and LBJ discussed it the day after JFK's murder.) What's more, at the same time \\"Lee\\" was supposedly in Mexico, witnesses said that the same guy was shooting at other people's targets at a Dallas shooting range.<br />This all begs the question: why would a supposedly unknown \\"lone crazed gunman\\" have a double pretending to be him before the assassination?<br />There are a boatload of other problems with the lone crazed gunman theory too numerous to go into here. But King ignored them all. When it comes to Oswald, King is obdurate.<br />So read King's novel for what it is: an enjoyable work of fiction. But don't be sucked in by the \\"lone gunman\\" fairy tale. For a NON-fictional, solidly researched, and far better examination of who really killed JFK and why, read James Douglass's JFK and the Unspeakable.

B007V5CF5K|5.0|I couldn't stop playing until I completed this game! I will definitely be buying more of Alawar's games. After trying out some of the other mystery/hidden object games out there, this was one of the best at this price range.

0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is a upbeat, very well paced, exciting novel. Filled with many suprises and things that keep you up all night thinking about it. I, myself enjoyed this book so much, I didnt want to stop reading it. Suzanne Collins has one it again!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I bought the book because I wanted to read the story before watching the movie. I loved it! Another great book that captured my interest quickly and kept me reading. Cant wait to watch the movie now.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|the best FREE survival that I played and if you don't like it you should be greatful that it is even free so keep your opinions and negative thoughts to yourself
B007MDB71O|5.0|An excellent film by one of the best directors current alive, but yet perhaps the worst handled film that Disney has ever attempted to release. Disney should be ashamed of the way they handled one of the greatest science fiction sagas to ever be imagined. Don't let the now fired Disney executives handling of this movie and the medias label of a \\"flop\\" turn you away from fundamentally one of the most unique story's to come to the screen in many years, it is truly a film to change the way you experience films. Stick it to Disney, buy this film, tell others to buy this film, and a few years from now when they do decide to make the sequel that is needed, to will be part of a movement that makes a lot of 'suits' look like the idiots they really are.
B001NPJGL0|5.0|An accurate product, easy to use. From the picture, you would think the product was larger than it actually is, but that dosen't matter. It is stil a good item, especially for the price. Shipped on time.
0307346617|4.0|About the book:<br />It never actually states exactly how long, but this book is set several years AFTER the \\"war\\" against zombies. It's almost like a documentary, much like the title states. There are dozens of survivors of all different races, backgrounds, social and economic classes interviewed. Each one having a unique perspective on what they did during the war, and how they contributed to the efforts of fighting that war.<br /><br />Other reviews of this book claim that it's hard to get into because it's basically a book of short stories or interviews. Although you do wish sometimes that the story/interview would continue, and sometimes you are left hanging, I never really felt like it was disappointing. I enjoyed each one.<br /><br />My Review:<br />Very good. I enjoyed and appreciated all the unique perspectives of the interviewees. A casual zombie fan would like this book. It makes you realize how absolutely terrifying a zombie/viral outbreak would be.
0345803507|5.0|This series was excellent. I read the entire trilogy in 2 days. I could not put it down. I loved the characters and was completely wrapped up in the story lines. Must read if you are into this kind of literature, if not then it may not be for you. Hot and steamy is putting things mildly :)
1439153663|5.0|set in the south during times of slavery this is one of the best books I have ever read. I had never considered what it would be like to have been an indentured servant although it is likely that some of my ancestors may have been. But for a young child to find herself indentured at a plantation and cared for by slaves was eye-opening to say the least.  By the second or third chapter, I was living that book and could no more put it down and move on to other things than I could fly. I am sure the neighbors wondered why my light was on throughout the night but I did not care. I had to find out \\"what happened\\". Wonderful plot and wonderfully written. I will keep this book and probably read it again one day--and I will surely recommend it to my friends.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|When I saw this only averaged 4 stars, I just had to weigh in. Their last two albums (Symmetry, Night Train) pretty much sucked. They were on an album-by-album downward trajectory, & my expectations were low. But either I'm high or this rivals the first album. Song for song, its amazing. Even Hopes & Fears had a couple dull tracks, in my opinion. Not so here. There's hooks galore, which let's face it is what we love about Keane, & the lead singer-forget his name--belts it ballsy & sweet as ever. Even the last two bonus songs are haunting. Won't go into track by track details, but if you love good hooks & great vocals, I can't recommend this enough. This album has made my week, maybe even my month. I'm lost in it. Wish there was more music like this in the world. If only the Killers would do a freaking album...
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I love War movies i just wish this series had more combat scenes. I enjoy this series but in my opinion its not as good as Band of Brothers. I wish they would have focused more on conditions of the war in that theatre and gotten deeper into the dirtyness of War. Seeing a few flame thrown soldiers running about and a soldier collecting Gold teeth just wasnt Gritty enough. I want to leave a film with a sense that ive been moved or disturbed i want to feel something besides a little action. I did not get that after seeing this series. That is why i deducted 1 star.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a really fun game! The only thing I would like to see is that after you win that they give you more coins.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|Katy Perry is an amazing talent.  This is one of those rare albums that is excellent from start to finish.  Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soooo awesome!!!!!!! it has so many different games to play. this is definitely worth getting! and it works great on the kindle fire.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I am using the microphone with my Kodak camera to do little training programmes or interview people. I used it for the first tie in a very noisy shopping mall, hoping that the mic would make a difference. The sound quality is outstanding. You can still hear the background noise but you can also hear my friend talk clearly. And she didn't talk very loud....<br />You can see it on my webapges salespartners.com.sg<br /><br />I can only recommend!
0736092269|5.0|This book contains great descriptions of exercises and also explains what muscles those exercises work.  I particularly like the pictures showing the muscles and how they are modified throughout the exercise.
B005636EA6|4.0|This music is additictive to listen to.  This is serius music for, well, serious party rocking.  The only reason I give it 4 stare rather than 5 is that, while there are a few excellent tracks on this album, there are a few that don't quite stack up.  To be expected with most full albums, but it does not take away from the fun yoy will have with it.  I highly recommend searching out the music videos for such songs as \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" and \\"Sexy And I Know It\\".  It will definately make you appreciate the tracks more.  Classic stuff.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game . one of the best Oregon trail games. I have found. recommended to all . start the journey.

B005L38QK2|4.0|I write this review more to give a warning than to share product details.<br /><br />Amazon had to send me two of this mouse. The first one arrived last week. I plugged it into my PC and it worked fine for a day or two. Then I downloaded the software from Steelseries' website so that I could access the advanced functions. (No, there is no disc included with the software and no instructions to go to the website to download the software. They leave it for us to know to do that to access the advanced functions.)<br /><br />Anyway, I downloaded the software and it killed the mouse! The lights all went black except for the little red circle above the scroll wheel. I even tried plugging the mouse into a second computer and the problem persisted - so I knew it wasn't just a question of how computer #1 was setup, but inside the mouse.<br /><br />I called up Amazon and got a great rep who was actually taking part in the Diablo beta, so he knew how important it was to get the replacement before Diablo III itself comes out next week. Without any hassle, he overnighted me the new mouse. Hooray for Amazon! I plugged the new mouse in and it immediately worked. Since I had the Steel Series software already installed, everything was hunky dory. The software recognized the mouse and all is now right with the world.<br /><br />My advice - Install the software from the manufacturer's website BEFORE plugging in the mouse.<br /><br />Otherwise, this seems to be a very nice mouse. I wish it were a little taller, so it would sit more comfortably in my big sasquatch-like hands, but hopefully I will adapt. The cord is thick like a shoe-lace. The red glow is beautiful and soothing. The buttons all seem easy enough to access. We're still a few days from the big game release, so I will most likely update this review once the mouse has been put to it's real test.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I'm in the final chapter of the game (I think) and have thouroughly enjoyed this game.  It's the perfect mix of hidden object and puzzles.  The story is good and the graphics gorgeous.  The story is longer than I thought it would be too.  The only thing I'd like is a little more background on the island.  The game did take a liile time to download but it was well worth the wait.  Please, please make more games like this!
0345803485|5.0|I ordered the first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" because I had heard a lot about it.  I kept an open mind and was immediately drawn in.  The book is not so much about BDSM, but more about a deep love that a very damaged man has for a woman and how it scares him.  I ordered the next two books and I finished them within 3 days.  I promise you that you will not be disappointed and you will smile, cry, and sometimes laugh while reading all of the books in the trilogy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a really cool app. sometimes it freezes but its for free so its not a big deal. its fun and entertaining
B00000IZOR|2.0|I agree with previous reviewers - the cord on the phone is very short (probably 3 or 4 inches long) so that when the child puts the phone to their ear, they have to lift the entire phone.<br /><br />It's cute to look at but not exactly functional or purposeful.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Ethan does not disappoint int this last installment!!! you get what the francise was made for.... ACTION , ACTION, and more ACTION! a must have in the library!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire triology is great!  Suzanne Collins' trilogy from the first page of the Hunger Games (book 1) to the last word in Mockingjay (third book) is extremely difficult to put down.  Katniss Everdeen is a character that you find yourself really caring about as well as all of the other key players along the way.  The action is fast paced and there never seems a good place to stop.  As each chapter ends you want to know what will happen next:  Will Katniss survice?  Will it be Gale or Peeta?  Will the rebellion be successful?  A great series for a long flight.  You'll be easily hooked!
B00005NWLO|5.0|Yes this is definitely a landmark album, in Lynyrd Skynyrd, \\"Southern Rock\\", \\"Classic Rock\\", and American Music history. This captures Lynyrd Skynyrd at their peak, during July of 1976, which was a historical year in it's own right, because it was our Nation's Bicentennial. Plus this 25th Anniversary Edition is the Best Editon, because not only do you get the original album, but you also get 8 alternative takes on songs.<br /><br />This was recorded in Altanta's Historic Fox Theatre, in downtown Atlanta, on Peachtree Street. A large portion of the proceeds from this three night concert, and the album was given to the City of Atlanta, for the \\"Save the Fox Foundation\\". You see, Atlanta's Fabulous Fox Theatre, built in the 1920's was about to be torn down, and turned into a parking lot. However, Skynyrd wasn't about to let that happen. After Skynyd donated a large portion of the proceeds of this \\"Classic Live Album & Shows\\" to Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, The Mayor named members of Lynyrd Skynrd as honorary citizens of Atlanta.<br /><br />Some key points in the album include, right before they perform \\"T for Texas\\", Ronnie introduces Steve Gaines, as the newest member of Skynyrd, to the audience. Ronnie mentions that Stevie is an \\"Okie\\", referring to the Merle Haggard song \\"Okie from Muskogee\\". Also, the guitar trio of Allen Collens, Gary Rossington & Stevie Gaines was one of the best guitar trios ever, period. This album contains some of the best guitar playing you'll ever hear. The original album contains the song \\"Crossroads\\" which is a \\"classic cover\\" of Cream's version of the Robert Johnson Classic. Also, on the original album, before they perform \\"Freebird\\", Ronnie tells the crowd they have time for one more song, and he asks the crowd what song is it, that they want to hear? After asking a time or two the crowd responds very loudly, \\"FREEBIRD\\"!!!!. When Skynyrd begans performing the song, Ronnie tells Gary to play it for Atlanta.<br /><br />As for as the alternative takes go, they are all fantastic versions. On the alternative version of \\"Freebird\\", Ronnie tells Gary to \\"play it for Duanne\\" (Duane Allman).<br /><br />On this album, you get the classic line-up of Ronnie, Gary, Allen, Artimus, Billy, Steve, and Leon. Plus, you get the original \\"honkettes\\", Jo Jo Billingly, Leslie Hawkins, and Cassie Gaines.<br /><br />Also, you get some great liner notes, including some great photos of the Fox Theatre, & Lynyrd Skynyrd along with their road crew, and several other great photos. Also, you get the original LP liner notes that were written by the legendary Cameron Crowe, Contributing Editor of the Rolling Stone magazine. Cameron Crowe is also famous for the movie \\"Almost Famous\\", which is a story about a young 16 year old Cameron, traveling with bands like the Allman Brothers Band & Lynyrd Skynyrd.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this very historic, \\"Classic\\" Live Album!!!!
B00001U0E1|5.0|This movie is hilarious, especially if you like British humor. It also has wonderful acting by just about the entire cast. I especially love Ben Afflecks character. It's a fabulous date night comedy, funny and sexy. Bit of a chick flick, maybe but I think the boys would be happy with it too.
B005PTYP70|5.0|IMF has a new hero and his name is Ethan Hunt! Old shows revived can sometimes be good thing!!!! this is one of those times!!!
B00783NWB6|1.0|Shall we say I was a fan of the Underworld series until I watched this piece of crap. The 3D depth pop out effects nothing compared to Resident evil Afterlife. Great cameras poor direction on how to use them I would say. I ran this through my Oppo bdp 93 into the Panasonic 7000 3D projector onto a 126\\" Carada screen with 3rd gen panny glasses and the picture was flat. I put Avatar on for 15 mins after just to restore my faith in 3D. The only thing that made this movie watchable was the 7.1 DTS MA sound track. Rent if there is nothing else to watch do not buy!
B007R0Y7VO|3.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I decided I definitely wanted to see it.  As soon as it became available on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to order the movie.  Throughout the whole thing I kept waiting for it to improve.  The special effects were good, but the story was mundane.  Boy gets horse, boy loses horse, boy reunites with horse and lives happily ever after. And I am a life-long horse lover.  I really expected more from Spielberg
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Buying all three books at a great price was wonderful.  Was able to read them all in a week!  Great value and am looking forward to the next movie.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|I found the book intriging and a fun read.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to solve puzzles.
B007549W62|1.0|I don't understand all the critic reviews on this movie.  It was so boring that I fell asleep on it.  A few people locked in a bunker doesn't excite not to mention the characters were dull and unbelievable.
B005UG53NS|5.0|Oh Harry Potter...what can I say? This was so much better than CATS. I would see it again and again!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Theres nothing really special about this game, just a good way to waste time.  Bad thing is you have to either buy or earn points in order to unlock additional games.
B007M6P01O|5.0|I had missed the last show of the season and was so happy to see that Amazon had it.  The purchas went through smoothly and the quality of the video was great.  I would/do/will work with Amazon again.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Just love this app. Being able to login and control your PC from a tablet is so handy. Also its fast enough to play things like web video pretty well. I haven't tried using it for gaming but I bet you could use it to play Diablo 3 on a tablet
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I like it.  Works as advertised and a useful tool for an amateur star observer.  I'm not always sure if pointing the cell phone at the star straight up or in the horizon direction is the proper approach but none-the-less I get what I'm looking for.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this application to be available for my kindle fire for a while, and it is finally here, YAY! Thank you!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I just got this game yesterday and I already love it! Very fun and addictive :) Totally worth the download.
1451627289|5.0|What a sweet and tender book this turned out to be! It wasn't at all what I expected and has more in common with THE GREEN MILE than CUJO. I won't rehash the plot since so many have done so but I will say it ended up reminding me of the book TIME AND AGAIN by Jack Finney and the movies TIME AFTER TIME and SOMEWHERE IN TIME. I made it a multi-media experience by pulling up Glenn Miller's audio of IN THE MOOD during a couple of crucial moments in the book, including the end, and that made me even more teary-eyed than I already was. Bravo, Mr. King! You've created another classic!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is really awesome. It allows me to get my local weather info whenever I need it... as long as I am in a hot spot.  I have yet to experience the alerts that I have heard others mention but that seem like it would be a pretty cool feature to have.  I also thought the little &quot;great day to...&quot; info was cute as well.  If nothing else, it inspires me to get out of the house on nice weather days and gives me some ideas about what to do once I am out there.  Well worth the download and you just cannot beat free these days.  No complaints!
0385528752|5.0|This book was the logical next step for me after reading [[ASIN:0156033909 Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts]] and [[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]]. Those both spoke about cognitive dissonance and cognitive illusion, and this one was about what to do about it.<br /><br />This is how the book breaks down:<br />INTRODUCTION. Here, Chip and Dan introduce their concept of the rider and the elephant. The rider is our rational side, and the elephant is our emotional side. (You can also think of them as the ego and the id or the planner and the doer.) The rider steers the elephant, but if there's a conflict between the rider and the elephant, the elephant's going to win every time. They make it clear, however, that the elephant isn't necessarily the bad guy. The elephant gets us to try new things (\\"Hey, wouldn't it be cool to...\\") and helps to calibrate our moral compass (\\"That's wrong!\\").<br /><br />DIRECT THE RIDER. The rider can get overwhelmed with too many choices or a lack of clarity. Chip and Dan lay out, very clearly, the steps you need to take to keep everyone's rational sides engaged in change. You need to focus on what's going well and replicate that and also define the goal clearly.<br /><br />MOTIVATE THE ELEPHANT. You can't just rely on rationality when trying to push for change. People might agree with you that you have the best course of action, but that's not going to motivate them to act. Chip and Dan talk about why it's important to make people feel the need for change and how to go about doing it.<br /><br />SHAPE THE PATH. Once you provide clear direction and motivate, you can also make the change easier. Eliminate all roadblocks to a specific behavior (or as many as possible), and the rider and elephant will find it much easier to do it. Chip and Dan use the Amazon one-click button as an example.<br /><br />All in all, this book was well-researched, invaluable to anyone who needs to lead a change, and witty. I laughed out loud multiple times. As soon as I finished, I adjusted my communication plan for a change I'm proposing at my company. The lessons learned here are immediately applicable.<br /><br />My only criticism (and it's a small one) is around the placebo effect. There's a very small section discussing a study about the placebo effect in which Chip and Dan state that the placebo effect only impacts how someone feels. This is categorically untrue. Placebo effects have also shown to impact ulcers, swelling, and even coughs.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Side note: I also had the pleasure of seeing Chip present this book, and I even got him to sign my copy (by running up to him like a crazy person as soon as he left the stage).<br /><br />His presentation was highly enjoyable--Chis has a dry wit that appealed tremendously to the crowd. If you get the opportunity to see him speak, I highly recommend that you take it.<br /><br />I rated the book beforehand, so I promise that my review and rating were not colored by the killer presentation.
B000000H3W|5.0|Though Chaos A.D. is Sepultura's most popular album, Arise was their best album. This album was way ahead of its time,  and 21 years later is still as relevant as it was in 1991.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen but was disappointed in the book. I was very anxious to start reading this book after hearing her talk about it constantly on her tv show but the book was more like a stand-up comedy show rather than more about Ellen and her life; maybe I expected too much and wanted it to be more personable; dont get me wrong, I loved her when she did stand-up but just expected more from the book; good reading though if you enjoy comedy.
B007HU4FZ2|4.0|I'm not sure where people are getting that it's horribly violent or gorey especially compared to what we see on tv & online these days in so called news but ok. Having said that it's a very good movie the acting is great. I don't pretend to be a specialist or expert on religion, the bible or so called biblical events but over all it seemed to hold to the idea we've all heard regardless of what our religions are & doesn't seem to try to hollywood it up for effect. Highly recommend it. I haven't seen this in a while but when I did it was in the ancient language of Aramaic which supposeably is a dead language & thus needed subtitles which can make it hard to keep up or for some make the movie seem longer then it is. Still subtitles or not even if you arent religious or cant read subtitles or understand fluenant Aramaic it's still a great movie. Enough that I felt compeled to rate & comment it and I never do that even with movies I can watch a millions & never tire of.
0756407125|5.0|This is a truly amazing book. Like the first book, I was completely caught up in the language as well as the story. To say that Rothfuss is a talented writer would be an understatement. He has created a second book which might be even better than the first.<br /><br />In this second installment, Kvothe leaves the University for a time. I was so accustomed and content with his University experience I was resistant to change. Of course Kvothe doesn't want to leave either. Oh, but what an adventure and what charges this holiday brings!<br /><br />The result is that our young Kvothe is getting older and we are nearing our understanding as to why he has exiled himself. The battle between the Innkeeper and Kvothe is being blurred by degrees, which is outstanding for the audience, who has come to love Kvothe. We are more familiar with Bast as well. He is who we want to be as the audience, shaking the brillant man awake.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how Rothfuss concludes this trillogy. I only hope that it comes out next year. What a painful wait it will be.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I bought this book and I learned some things I didn't know. That's really all I hope to get out of any `How To' book. I liked (and agree with) John's marketing strategy and his sales volume speaks to its effectiveness. It always surprises me when someone takes the time to write a lengthy negative review. I mean, c'mon, we're talking about a $3 How-To book here, not the cure for cancer. I thought his book provided many interesting ideas and I'd recommend it to anyone planning to publish a Kindle book.

B005LAIGLE|5.0|I went to see this movie the day it came out in the theater.  It's an awesome movie, action packed and has some funny parts. Mark Wahlberg who is an awesome actor plays his part so good.  I recommend watching. I also recommend buying.  It's worth watching again.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have had this loaded on my Fire for over a month now and its been a lot of fun.  I have never bought anything with real cash.  I did have a couple of items that in into a long time out but I just left them alone or sold them and rebought them.  At first you don't get a lot of energy but I usually play twice a day for just a little while each time, so it works out find and you do get more energy then you get to higher levels.
B004LROUW2|5.0|With 369 reviews already written, another review is hardly necessary.  Yet I want to give this novel my highest recommendation. I cannot think of a better melding of a love story and a thriller and a fantasy all rolled into one.  Sure, there are plenty of loose ends, but isn't that just like real life?  This is a story of solid people who join forces and fight their way through adversity.[[ASIN:B005KB98R0 Nate and Adel and Other Stories]][[ASIN:B005KBQISC Adel's Journal and Other Stories (Nate and Adel and Other Stories)]]
0985081821|5.0|It's Sophia's voice that hooked me, almost from page one. There is something about the way she tells her own story that felt open and honest and just likeable. Which is not to say Sophia herself is always open, honest or easy to be around in regards to the other characters - just that despite whatever turmoil she's going through, her first-person narration stays true to herself. She never feels like an \\"unreliable narrator.\\"<br /><br />But strong first-person narration does not a great book make. Sophia's voice hooked me, but the plot kept me. Rebecca Hamilton takes two tropes of the urban fantasy genre, blends them together and creates something exciting and original.<br /><br />The first trope is the \\"misunderstood Wiccan outsider in a small community with a secret to hide.\\" It's a stereotype, isn't it? But where some authors would hang a few generic and poorly-researched \\"wiccan\\" symbols on the character and move on, Hamilton clearly spent time building Sophia's world-view and making it as much a part of her as any real Wiccan's religion would be to them. In other words, it doesn't feel like a trope or a handy stereotype; it feels like a natural part of an intriguing character's life.<br /><br />The second trope is the \\"we're not vampires/werewolves, but the vampire/werewolf myths were based on us\\" trope that has become increasingly handy for authors who want a recognizable supernatural threat but who want to be able to change the rules. Octavia E. Butler used this to great effect in \\"Fledgling,\\" and Hamilton does it just as effectively here. In the Cruor and Strigoi, Hamilton takes what most of us (Hamilton included, I'd assume) love about vampires and shape-shifters and then twists it for her world's needs, adding some original thought in along the way; her races are not different for differences' sake, but different because it's what her story & world need them to be. The fact that she mentions the Cruor were the basic of vampires myths exactly once, and then never brings it up again, is another perfect touch: we've gotten the point, it doesn't need to be bashed over our heads. What we learn of Cruor culture feels more authentic because we're not constantly being reminded that they're \\"vampires.\\"  And the Cruor-Strigoi-Ankou-etc culture is something I eargerly await learning more about in future books.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoy about Hamilton's writing: the book is detailed without being full of details. It's another effective use of Sophia's voice; she shares details of what she smells, what she tastes, what she and others are wearing, because these are the things that matter to her, but she leaves out details of architecture, history, weather, because to her they are less important. This means we're not bogged down with \\"filler\\" events in the narrative. Months go by between chapters (the book essentially jumps from Halloween to Christmas at one point, with one short paragraph explaining the leap) and that's okay because it keeps the book moving and keeps our heroine from sounding like she's completely lost in morose self-pity. (Instrospective, Sophia is; maudlin, she's not.)<br /><br />Obviously, as I've given the book 5 stars, I really don't have anything to complain about. I will say this: I wish the relationship between Sophia and her friends Ivory and Lauren had been developed a little stronger in the opening chapters to give later events even greater weight. This is the one thing in the book where I felt Sophia's voice went slightly awry; if these are her best friends, I'd have liked to see more indication of that earlier on. But it's a minor quibble in a book that otherwise kept me up late to finish it. The last quarter of the book is a bit of a mad dash and I loved every moment of it.never brings it up again, is another perfect touch: we've gotten the point, it doesn't need to be bashed over our heads.

B005IGDW24|1.0|The item has not arrived! It was supposed to be on the 9th but not yet. Still waiting!<br />This is the second time it was sent to me!!!
B007P6VM04|5.0|Yes they could have added more songs to the cd, or just had a second album all togeather. However I do think they picked great songs for this album and I love it! Way to go SMASH!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I really don't understand why some people are so critical of this movie. It was fun and entertaining. I thought the acting was great, the story worked, and even though it wasn't exactly like the comics, most movie aren't. If they make a movie exactly like the comic, it usually fails miserably (See Watchmen). They kept many of the legit parts in such as the alien crashing on earth and Hal finding him and getting the ring by putting it on. I thought Ryan Reynold's did a great Green Lantern. I can see if they had a Justice League movie, it would be difficult to have Batman of the current movies in a movie with Green Lantern since the current Batman movies are based on \\"real\\" style whereas the Green Lantern movie is more fantasy, like Avengers style. I guess I always enjoy the fantasy stuff better because I live reality, and go to movies for the fantasy which is what made this movie so great. Not to mention the heavy eye candy of Blake Lively that played her part perfectly. If you like fun movies, don't over-analyze things, and just enjoy it for what it is, and entertaining popcorn flick with plenty of action, comedy, and romance. Then you'll enjoy this film.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love tthis game its so fun to play it keeps u busy Hutu have to buy a lot of things I still love it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun and easily entertaining game.  No extra buy ins and reminds of Farmiville like games.  I have only played for a day and will probably play off and on from now on.
B0020M99LC|4.0|One  of the best bond movies rivals Sean Connery as best bond ever, runs laps around Pierce Brosnan. More complex better story than the typical shock and awe, skin and gadget flicks of the previous Bond movies. Carries the story started in Casino Royal in a believable and consistent way.
B000YPUFA6|3.0|I didn't really enjoy this one as much as I did one, two, and four. I really wasn't blown away by anything in this movie, and I don't think the desert setting helped out to much either, though the zombies were pretty nasty looking. Two stars for the zombies and a extra star for having MikE Epps back.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|definitely is a fun game to play when you don't have anything to do. just one flaw is I cant get the update so I can go to other villages.
0345803485|1.0|I would give this zero stars if I could.<br />I do not usually read this type of genre, so maybe that's part of it.  I had read the first Twilight book several years ago and found it geared towards a teenager's brain.  I felt this book was as well, except for the graphic nature of the sex.  And the sex.  And the sex.  ZZZZZ.<br />Rolling eyes.  Over and over.<br />Biting her lip.  Over and over.<br />Her inner goddess.  Over and over.<br />Her subconscious.  Over and over.<br />Oh my! Over and over.<br />Blushing.  Over and over.<br />And then sex.  Over and over.  And over.<br />Boring is not erotic.<br />This book bored me to death.  My husband could not understand why I would not just stop reading it.  Well, I paid for it.  Sadly, I bought the whole trilogy.  Sigh.  A couple of weeks ago, I attempted to read the rest of it and got several chapters down.  It is an easy read, I'll give it that.  Or maybe it's just that I was skimming so much since there was nothing of substance.  Husband came home just as I reached the last chapter.  Then, I forgot about it.  I finally remembered it today and finished it.  I was quickly reminded why I don't like it.  Same old, same old.<br />It is repetitive.<br />It is repetitive.<br />It is repetitive.<br />And as for the \\"story\\" itself, I despise the dynamics of a man attempting to control a woman. His jealousy really pisses me off.  Not a big fan of control freaks or women who try to change them.  I found the characters to be shallow and uninteresting.  They are so intrigued by one another, yet there is nothing intriguing about either one.  They are so witty, yet never say anything witty.  Is there a dimension smaller than 1? This is it. The plot line was a triple Z.<br />Oh, and BUY HER A TOOTHBRUSH, ALREADY.
B004CYKZZA|3.0|All in all, this is a good wireless headset.<br /><br />I'm not qualified to make any real comment about audio quality, but the music mp3s I listened to sounded as good or better than my stereo. Wireless range is good, and battery life seems good as well. These are not the most comfortable headset I've used, however I can where them for hours without them becoming painful or less comfortable. I also haven't had any problems with the mic or the charging cable which is USB on one end and non-USB on the other.<br /><br />One of the two things that I dislike about the headset is that they block out a lot of outside noise(eg. When I have this headset on I can't hear my desktop speakers). This would not be so bad if this headset did not produce a constant 60 Hz hum. Charging it or not makes no difference, there is a constant buzz in both ears. When there is sound coming through I can't make it out but whenever it should be silent it hums for this reason alone I can't recommend these headphones.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|If you are going to buy this movie make sure you get the blu ray so that you get the black and white version of the movie, it makes it so much better, that is if you like B&W movies. Also if you are a fan of Stephen Kings movies check out the blu ray version of 1408, the ending is totally different than the DVD version and alot scarier.
0061992860|5.0|This manual and the US Army version are outstanding for those wanting to refresh their memories about surviving in the wilderness, or people wanting to get a start on learning about such things.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is one fantastic Springsteen album.  On first listen, you might think, \\"This is a really good album\\".  But after about 5 listens you'll start to absorb the incredible lyrics which reflect a lot of different perspectives about our great recession.  The musical styles, too, are very diverse and interesting.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|the raidio shorted out in my car so i downloaded this and now i dont have to drive in silence.
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic. Just having the Nemesis is this movie is worth 5 stars. He looks incredible. I liked the first movie alot, but I love the second one. Anyone who has not seen this has to check it out. Having Mike Epps in it helps out to, he is a great comedian.
B003Y5H5EW|1.0|Absolutely terrible.  The graphics, scenes and acting were all awful.  Not only that, but what ever a-hole was in charge left it open for another one to come out, I am sure only to be worse.  Do not waste your money or your time.  I want to kick all but one of the directors and producers in the crotch, the last one I would just light on fire.
B000002H33|1.0|Since this is my first review about anything relating to Metallica, I'll be honest here and say that even in my early days of being a metalhead, I never found much appeal behind them.  Sure, their first two albums \\"Kill Em' All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" had some good moments of worthwhile thrash voltage, but a lot of what they made after 1984 lacks the metal spark that's so vital to any metal band.  While I don't think this is one of the absolute worst metal albums ever, I certainly think it's by far the most overrated and as a whole, it commits one of the worst crimes a metal band can commit, which is being boring.<br /><br />For those of you who frequently go on Metal-Archives.com, you're probably familiar with an infamous review of \\"Master of Puppets\\" posted by a member named UltraBoris, in which he gave a large, meticulously-detailed review explaining why he felt MOP destroyed the heavy metal genre, and therefore, labeled it as the worst album to ever happen to heavy metal.  While I probably wouldn't go as far as to say it killed heavy metal and is the worst thing that ever happened to the genre, I'll say that this album really shows Metallica falling apart and even though I don't really think Metallica was brilliant to begin with (I'll say they were decent at the start), this really shows the band rapidly declining in terms of quality.<br /><br />MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />The musicianship on this album is a mixed bag.  I say that because while James Hetfield and co. are clearly capable of dishing out some competent thrash songs, they decide to indulge in poorly-executed ballads and progressive rock, while sacrificing a large part of the thrash element in most of their songs.  Now I wouldn't mind the incorporation of different elements in the thrash formula, but I don't like the fact that the songs dominated by such elements are played with virtually no spark or energy.<br /><br />James Hetfield's rhythm guitar is decent when he's putting his heart into it, but alas, since a lot of the songs aren't headbanging thrash anthems, I can almost sense the boredom flowing out of his guitar.  While Hetfield's vocals aren't terrible, I've heard much better, and they just lack the insanity and aggression that benefit the thrash genre as a whole.<br /><br />Kirk Hammett can dish out some good thrash riffs when he's pressed to do so, and while he can make some good-sounding guitar solos, his skills are largely wasted on this album for tepid material.<br /><br />Cliff Burton can come up with some good basslines, though I think his case can be best said with the fact that his skill on the bass guitar can't overcome the fact that most of the songs are just boring.<br /><br />Lars Ulrich's drumming isn't anything special, other than a few exciting thrash-beats he's able to dish out on the album's more intense songs.  Like many a devout metalhead, I think Ulrich is a horribly-overrated drummer who doesn't have 1% the skill of such skin-bashers like Gene Hoglan or Pete Sandoval.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />First, I'll cover the good songs on here.  \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is really the only song on this album I'd say is a powerful, good song.  This is what the whole album should have sounded like.  \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is a rather exceptional piece of work since it exceeds the 8 minute mark and has some good progression throughout, all while not sacrificing any of that thrashing spark that all thrash metal bands should strive for in their material.  The guitar solos on this one are some of the best I've heard Metallica ever dish out.  \\"Damage, Inc.,\\" while not as good as \\"Disposable Heroes,\\" is a competent thrasher that with a little more adjustment, could have been an excellent counterpart to \\"Disposable Heroes.\\"  Thankfully, \\"Damage, Inc.\\" closes the album on a higher note, given that most of the album is plodding, dull material.<br /><br />Now I'm going to cover the lukewarm songs.  Despite the fact that \\"Battery\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" are supposed to be the other \\"thrash\\" songs on here, they feel like they're being played at half the energy \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Damage, Inc.\\" are being played at.  Because of this lack of energy in the songs, I just found myself gently nodding my head while I was listening to them, when I should have felt like getting up and furiously banging my head.  \\"Leper Messiah\\" is more or less the same as \\"Battery\\" and \\"Master of Puppets.\\"<br /><br />Now I'm going to talk about the bad songs, and these \\"experimental\\" songs are the death-kneel of this album.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" are prime examples of how NOT to write metal songs.  These two songs are unbelievably dull and totally lack the metal spirit.  There's very little variation in \\"The Thing That Should Not Be,\\" and this made it feel like the song just kept going on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.  Okay, you get the picture.  \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" totally lacks the metal spirit for the fact that feels too slow and soft, and it doesn't help that Hetfield sounds like a whiny kid bleating out \\"Leave me be\\" and \\"Leave me alone.\\"  \\"Orion,\\" despite its inclusion of some flashing instrumental noodling, is a really lukewarm, drawn-out instrumental song.  Going back to the technical skills of the musicians, they can't save a song that's fundamentally dull.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />This album feels like it has decent production values since all the instruments and vocals are all well-mixed and don't seem to overpower each other, though good production values won't save music that's poorly-written.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />If you're a fair-weather metal fan or someone who's more into hard rock, then you'll probably love \\"Master of Puppets.\\"<br /><br />However, if you're a guy like me who's usually craving thrash metal that pushes the boundaries of intensity, then this album probably won't be in your collection that long, as you'll probably find yourself looking for thrash albums loaded with the heavy metal spirit.  For those who fall in this category, I prescribe the following as a remedy for your pains (if you don't have these in your collection already).<br /><br />The Unholy Trinity of 1986:<br /><br />Slayer-Reign in Blood<br />Kreator-Pleasure to Kill<br />Dark Angel-Darkness Descends<br /><br />If you're looking for some thrash that's more in line with technical and progressive metal, I strongly suggest you give Coroner's \\"RIP\\" and Watchtower's \\"Control and Resistance\\" a shot.posed to be the other \\"thrash\\" songs on here, they feel like they're being played at half the energy \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Damage, Inc.\\" are being played at.

0345803485|5.0|This book is very interesting, adult based (not for the young)..it leaves you thinking about the dark side of the character's personalities, what provoked them to become the person they are? Can they become something other then what they are protrayed as? Very good, quick, addicting read...probably should order the complete trilogy right away!!
B000XJ5TOK|4.0|I love the video game series. I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time. It just sucked me in instantly and before you know it I was out looking for the first one. This movie is no different. It sucks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let up till the end. It is a fantastic action/horror/sci-fi movie that is filled with great special effects. If you are a zombie or video game lover this film is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally was immersed in this book!!!!  I usually read mystery's and just wanted to see what people were raving about. I had to read the whole trilogy!  Should have bought the trilogy in the beginnin. Excellent story
1446301583|5.0|I had been wanting this for a long time, I am glad that I got it!  I look forward to making the dolls, if not just for me1
B000CNESU8|5.0|I love the film, and that the Special Edition was so perfectly presented and so quickly expedited. A win. If not for Howard Beale, then for my film library.
B0035V35PI|5.0|This movie has a style all its own. The fight scenes are just incredible. This is one movie you must check out. There is no way you can be disappointed by this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'm a fifth grade teacher and decided this book wasn't one I would put in my classroom library, so bought the kindle edition for my iPad. I enjoyed the story and would definitely recommend it to older students or to adults who enjoy reading scifi. The only drawback to buying the trilogy (which was a lower price than the three books separately) is that the loan time for this book isn't really enough time to actually read it. My husband was disappointed he couldn't finish it before the loan expired.
B004I744AS|4.0|great i just wish that there was an app for dictionary that doesnt need internet... good anywayz! like how it shows past words ;) yay
0345803485|5.0|This book was chosen for our book club this month. It was such a page turner, that I read all 3 books in the trilogy.  I had heard of the book and that a lot of people were reading it, but didn't know a lot about it and was a little shocked at first at how descriptive it is.  That turned into being pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the book - and I might have learned a thing or two!<br /><br />This is the author's first novel and she overuses a few phrases, but overall it was a great story.
B003Q6D25U|4.0|This lives up to the paranormal activity name. Its was filled with really good scares. The kitchen scene scared the crap out of me. If you loved the first one, you will not be disappointed by this one. I also appreciated how they kept the story line from the first one going in this one and not just start over fresh with a new family or couple.
1592402038|5.0|The author of this book, Lynne Truss, truly feeds the soul of each of us grammatical sticklers. Before this book, I never even imagined it possible for a book to discuss grammar with such wit. I must confess, once I found out that Truss was British, I did not expect anything else! The manner in which this book is written allows all readers, at least those who are somewhat interested in grammar, to enjoy a book and have a few laughs. Do not be surprised if you find yourself going for a pencil or some type of writing utensil after reading something that you would like to forever remember!<br /><br />Along with comic relief, Truss provides us with lessons, which are truly needed for some people. There are various examples throughout this book that reinforce all that we are taught and sadly, in some cases, forget. This book not only highlights the importance of punctuation, but also ties in its role throughout history. Even though punctuation has come a long way, we have yet to completely agree how to use it. By far, out of all of the examples of grammatically provoked arguments, the funniest of them all are between two editors! You would think that two incredibly educated people could find a common ground when dealing with such a matter, but think again! At times, grammatical sticklers can be quite vicious, so; consider yourself warned!<br /><br />Do not let this work of grammatical pertinence pass you by! It is a book that will satisfy all of your grammatical needs and desires. Besides, we can all use a refresher course in punctuation from time to time.
B007NCSJYW|5.0|I ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves it. This is basically her rating. It was so-so to me.
B0013ND30W|2.0|I bought the DVD/Blu-ray combo. I never played the Blu-ray, but the DVD was unreadable on my PC and DVD player. I returned the item.
B002VECM4K|5.0|As soon as I seen that Tyler Perry was involved I knew I had to see this movie. This movie is a very sad, gut wrenching movie. To watch this young lady being treated like trash and abused, both physically and sexually by her mother (physically) and her mothers boyfriend (sexually) is just hard not only to watch but to comprehend. How could a mother have that much hate toward her her daughter. This is a fantastic movie, but be forewarned it is a strong, powerful movie that you will not soon forget.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|Great cast, decent story loosely based on Hunter S. Thompson's life, gorgeous location filled with mystery and intrigue yet it fell so flat. I, honestly, cannot put my finger on it as to why it failed, but I felt the story seemed to fizzle out.<br /><br />DVD extras are nothing to write home about either.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|For what reason do you need my personal contact data or access to my camera?  what's with in in game ads in the laid version?  uninstalled.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I found this app very helpful organizing my monthly budget.  It's nice to see all of my upcoming regular expenses all on my tablet.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is in my top 5 best lookings kids 3D movies. The train scene on the ice is really cool looking. The blu ray movie alone looks really good. We watch this movie along with Nightmare before Christmas and Christmas Vacation and a few others every christmas. This is a wonderful movie, that will bring out the kid in you and make you believe in Santa again!
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Putting the plot aside, I would say this movie is a mediocre Hollywood special effects movie.<br />I wanted desperately to see the original after watching this just to remember what 'color' was.<br />Here's the thing:<br /><br />1.  You are inside the computer/net!  really?  didn't see much in there. Few if any references to RAM, bits, CPUs, Facebook, email, etc. Computer games? yes, only what we have seen before in the original Tron.<br />2.  You are inside the computer/net:  You can make a movie with no bounds. You can change gravity, you can do anything!  Friggin World of Warcraft is more intersting than this monochrome city with dark clouds above it!<br />3. Go rent the orginal and use these discs to put drinks on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is the only game I have on my kindle. I play it all the time and my sister enjoys playing it to.

B003UMW68Y|5.0|This movie never gets old. We watch out every Halloween and Christmas. The kids enjoy it along with the adults. It is even better now that it is on blu ray. Can't wait to get it in 3D. Tim Burton has a phenomenal imagination! He never disappoints.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|graphics are great....love the fact that this game is truly FREE in a sense that you can go from level to level or goal to goal without spending your real $
B0054JZC6E|5.0|kids love it they play it all the time one of their favorite on the kindle....great for kids have fun playing
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A combination of a Harlequin Romance and Hustler magazine.  Read it but definitely would not recommend it!  Will not be reading the rest of the trilogy.
B004EPZ02A|3.0|This one was not as good as the first two. There were a couple decent scares, but most of them were in the trailers. The one scene that I found pretty creepy was the sheet scene, that was rather dusturbing. Hopefully 4 will be better.
0399159029|5.0|Philip Kerr has done it again with the intrepid Bernie Gunther matched against his nemesis, Reinhardt Heydrich.  Prague Fatale is superb; it puts Philip Kerr in the same class as Hans Helmut Kirst in his mastery of anti-Nazi satire combined with heart stopping tension.  A memorable read !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun. some of them are little hard to use the controls,  but still fun. I like that u have to work to unlock new games, because it makes it challenging
B004XDYJRU|1.0|On this PAID version, yes paid, I woke up to ads in my notification bar on my phone and tablet. The notification bar is NOT FOR ADS. This is such an a-hole move my a company. DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!! They spam your notification bar with ads - the next big ugly wave of ad pushing.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|This is a great horror movie. It will scare the crap out of you the first time you watch it, but it does seem to be less creepy the second time around. I guess that could be true with almost any horror movie once you know where the scares are. It just goes to show you, that you dont need millions of dollars to make a great horror movie.
1607885719|5.0|This was my first introduction to David Baldacci and this I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Innocent\\" on audio CD's.  It captured my attention and I had a hard time turning it off.  I will definitely be getting more of his work on CD's.

0765348276|5.0|You live to reach 75 year old.Instead of retiring and being \\"put out to pasture\\" by society, you decide to join the army.<br /><br />But don't they need only young able-bodied people in the army? Yep they do, and that's why you get a brand new, young body, with which to do your military service.<br /><br />This is achieved through a device which is able to transfer your consciousness from your old decrepit body to the new, strong young one.<br /><br />You and your old senior citizen team mates re-discover all the joys of young adulthood all over again, but now only a hundred-fold so.<br /><br />After the initial enjoyment period,you are sent out into the universe to fight alien races who have dedicated their own existence to the extermination of humans.<br /><br />Now all we have is action, action, action. Wicked and wild action. If you don't mind being constantly on the edge of your seat, like when watching a hair-raising movie, then this book is definitely for you.<br /><br />Above all, it all seems very plausible and reality-sounding.
B003Y5H556|2.0|This movie just seemed to much like twilight except its not set in modern day. The one guy even king of looks like Edward. It was like twilight with a cheaper budget. Totally disappointed by this movie, the trailer made it look better than out actually was. I wasn't so much waiting to see who was the werewolf, but waiting for the credits. Skip this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game reminds me of the game I played when I was a kid. I love this game and am slightly addicted.
1606865617|5.0|Arundhati Roy's powerful novel is beautifully rich in imagery and language, told perfectly without being patronizing through a child's eyes, capturing the chaos of India and the helpless nature of children's lives caught in a larger scene. Worth reading many times.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I read a review of this app that said if you liked the movie you'd hats the game. Not true. However, I do feel that if you can put in nobodies like Blacktop or Aquabot in the game, come on, you've got to have Zeus or at the VERY least Atom. But I like it. Needs work, but yeah. I especially like how Noisy Boy, my fave, isn't in the movie much but you can still use him ( like a boss) .
B003Y5H542|4.0|This is not you're regular animated movie. First off it is a western with birds, lizards,etc. as your characters and second it seems to be more geared towards adults than childern. The most surprising thing is it really works. Johnny Depp did a really good job at voicing Rango. He brings alot to the character just through his voice, it is really amazing.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I don't like hiking or sleeping in a tent but this book is riveting and seamlessly merges the physical and the spiritual.  I couldnt put it down.-- Lee Sennish
0679745203|5.0|\\"The English Patient\\" brings together all the elements of a classic story - love and mystery, history and exotic settings, told with Ondaatje's beautiful, poetic prose. The tale does not progress in a linear fashion, but is revealed as layers unwrap in the interaction of four characters in a ruined Italian villa at the end of the war. A beautiful book.
B007URCTOG|5.0|I just got done watching this movie and had to write a review due to the fact it only got 3 1/2 stars, in my opinion so underrated. That's crazy! I thought this movie was really awesome. Even my husband, who I thought would totally think it's a chic flick and not really be interested in, watched the entire movie and actually said he thought it was really good and it should have gotten more than 3 1/2 stars. The movie is based on a true story about a married couple who get in a car accident and the wife loses her memory. It practically starts off with the accident but then shows some flashbacks of them together and how totally in love they were. Channing Tatum played an adoring husband who is so in love with his wife and is willing to do anything to get her memory back. I thought Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams made a cute couple and just watching how cute they were together just made me think of how much I love and appreciate all my husband does for me and just makes you think of how sometimes you just take things and time for granted. That may sound sappy but that is how it made me feel and it is a film that I would definitely watch again. It's a great movie for couples, married or dating, to watch together, or even a couple of friends. I don't think you would be disappointed.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I saw better free games for the VIC-20, TRS-80, and Timex-Sinclair. It looks like something that was programmed in BASIC on the early computers.<br /><br />Yes, I am OLD.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I couldn't stop reading it! The writing is beautiful and contains an flare that most authors do not present through their books. My favorite part of a book is getting to know the characters inside and out. Although I would have liked to learn more about their appearances, I really felt like I knew the characters. I felt their emotion and I felt for them. I would have loved the romance to begin earlier in the book, but the way it is presented makes sense due to the storyline.<br />The theme is different than most other books. I love vampires and werewolves and find myself bored with romances, so when I found this, I felt comfortable investing my time in a fantastical book that is very real to life. I also loved the time period that the book takes place it. The author does an incredible job staying true to the era throughout the actions and dialogues of the characters.<br />There are more books in this series that focus on other characters beyond the main character in this book. I think that I will end up reading them, but I will miss the main character kata very much.<br /><br />Love love loved it!! I definitely recommend this book!
B0080CLN7Y|5.0|A perfect mind vacation.  I always look forward to the next episode. It light viewing but the guys are so cute...I can't resist.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun game but its really super hard . I think u should try it.u won't ever regret buying it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I started reading this book last night and I was hooked. I read the book in less than 24 hours.  The author keeps you on your toes and you never know what will happen next.  I wish this book was a series because it's a fantastic book that is well written.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I was never into comics as a child, so my view of this movie will be different from anyone who has an emotional link to the story.  As far as I am concerned, this movie was okay.  I didn't hate it, I didn't love it.  I wouldn't watch it again on my own, but if my friends wanted to see it again I wouldn't beg for another choice.<br /><br />The sound track is really good, as are the graphics, but there wasn't a whole lot of engaging story for me. Some people don't mind that, if you are one of them, then see the movie.  Some people know the story behind Tron, and they like it too, I'm not one of them, so I just didn't really get it.<br /><br />The movie isn't a waste of time to watch, but I would recommend renting before buying.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible reader is almost perfect! The only item on my wishlist is &quot;BACK&quot; and &quot;FORWARD&quot; buttons so that when I am sitting in church and the pastor says, &quot;put your finger here, and turn to...&quot; , then I can flip to the various passages without going through the menu each time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was not only well written, but I learned a lot a bout a man who, though terribly flawed, changed the world.
B004EPYZXU|1.0|So stupid, one of the weird movie ever, shacking camera all the way, the story is long very long before to get to the rocks eaters (witch is unbelievably stupid), so at the end, it s only the last 20mn that you know that the moon's rock are the devil, and they do not have even the shape of a monster, they are still rocks....<br />I DO NOT RECOMMAND THIS MOVIE !!
B000JQU4TW|3.0|Very wordy. Takes too long to get to the point. Very poetic if that is what You want - not the case for me As i try to escape from reality in books but just wanted to escape from this book.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|I could literally go on and on about how much I love this album, I could do a track-by-track review, but there is no need. Strangeland is, in my opinion, the most well thought out and well written record Keane has ever made. Every track will either 1. instantly grab you, or 2. grow on you until you love it so. From the moment Tom starts singing on You Are Young to last lingering moments of It's Not True you'll feel engulfed by beauty. And that's what this album is, pure art and beauty, the songs are a little poppy, but they're a different kind of pop, a piano pop, a Keane pop, not like Perfect Symmetry, but a lot like Under the Iron Sea and Hopes & Fears mixed together. It seriously is a must buy.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />You Are Young, Silenced By the Night, The Starting Line, Neon River, Sea Fog, Strangeland, The Boys
0071624058|4.0|just as the name of the book implies; it is the best guide as regards to toefl ibt. The reading, listen and speaking sections of the book is very okay but, the writing section is not explanatory enough. Just need to combine it with any other good toefl ibt books.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|I loved this! Everything is perfect. I would rather have the monster ball dvd be blu-ray though. And the Born This Way The Remix is phenominal!
B007P6VM04|5.0|What a treat this music is.  Finally something new/original & catchy.  Both leading ladies voices are amazing on this CD.  What a great new TV show as well.  Season finally is tonight.  I cant wait for the 2nd season.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|On the surface this looks like the stupidest comedy ever conceived, but in actuality it's... well, actually it's every bit as dumb as it seems, but it's also inconceivably hilarious. Loaded up with eyeball-rolling gags and perfectly-timed celebrity cameos, it's overstuffed with stream-of-consciousness satire and the very best veins of Ben Stiller's unchained sense of humor. Stiller's ironic crosshairs wave all over the place, landing precise jabs at society, fashion, politics and celebrity while still finding time to keep the ridiculous primary narrative in motion. Owen Wilson is flawless as Zoolander's flaky new-wave rival Hansel (he's so hot right now) and Will Ferrell makes the most of a criminally-brief amount of screen time in his own inimitable way. I was blown away by how creatively funny this was the first time I sat down with it, and I'm equally amazed with how well it's held up over the ensuing eleven years. The laughs simply do not stop coming.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I saw the pilon thinking it would be more of a childish dreamy series, and it turned out to be a one very well though series with twists and turns and a more Brother's Grim view than Disney wich makes it even better!<br /><br />From beginning to the very last episode an excellent show that promises a lot for the second season.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This is the perfect follow up to The Fame. It's darker and she has matured so much. I love it.
098478280X|5.0|Many a time I have taken a tech interview, and as a tech manager of over 5 years I've given 50 fold more of them.<br /><br />Several months ago, I wanted to change companies, and went on the biggest tech interview of my life. I studied my own notes, looked over my own code, and reviewed some scalability blogs. I studied, I put in the effort, I prepared, but I was not prepared enough. I'm an incredible (but not humble!) software engineer, I aced the soft questions, but did not excel in the coding questions. Fail.<br /><br />A month later, I once again went on the biggest tech interview of my life, this time with Facebook. And this time, with this book. I studied for 3 weeks straight, finally with a purpose. Finally with the tools I needed to really get the most out of my study time. The days were long, the sweat dripped off my brow, and the frustration seeped out of my pours. This stuff was not easy. But, come interview day, I was relaxed. This time, I was actually prepared. This time, I cracked the coding interview.<br /><br />Thank you, Gayle.
B002VHI8FE|2.0|I bought this book based on the majority of good reviews - like so many others I was looking for something to fill the gap left while waiting on the next George R.R. Martin book.  Now I'm one-third of the way into this book and I realized that I don't look forward to picking it up to read it and I'm frankly just forcing myself to do it because I paid for it.  That's when it becomes time to cut my losses and give it up.<br />The personalities in this book did not draw me in; to me, they weren't interesting or even likable.  And I feel that by the time I've read a third of the book SOME kind of plot should be emerging, but this was just wandering reading with no real point to it.<br />I'm very disappointed because I really enjoy a good long-term read that I can get into and stay with over time.  Most of the reviewers liked this book, but it just isn't there for me.
0345803485|5.0|I am on book one and I am enjoying it very much. I thought it was just me noticing how many words were used over and over. The one word that seems to irritate me the most is hitch! Example: Her breath hitched as he kissed her... I almost can't take reading it one more time. But, I suppose I will because the story line has me hooked and Christian keeps running his fingers through his hair while looking at Ms Steele. After all, he does wear his pj's down low on his hips, and I just have to give in!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Android App is an excellent tool for anyone wanting to read the Bible on his or her own or join a program! You can choose from a multitude of versions. The programs range from a few days to a year or more. Some take few minutes a day to complete while some are longer. You can choose a program by topic or by book. I currently am reading a year long devotional and a 31 day psalsms and proverbs program. This is definately worth the download. In addition their online help is very good.
0802473156|5.0|I was beginning to get a bit put off on marriage books, as the last 2 I read didn't do much for me. A friend suggested that I read this book when I was (still am) having marital problems and I told my friend I didn't think I was loving my wife the way she needed to be loved. Turned out, I stumbled upon the core concept in this book. This book put into words so eloquently all the thoughts I was having and made my have all sorts of further realizations about my marriage. If you read one book on marriage, this is the one it should be. Its short, simple, but powerful. Had I read this book earlier, I could have easily saved my marriage. I know now how I need to love my wife. This book was so good that I ordered another book written by the author \\"The 5 languages of apology\\".
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I bought season one and sent it to my son in texas.He hasn't seen breaking bad before but is now a die hard fan of the show. Therefore I sent him season two. He is now watching season two and anticipating season three.
B002LS4M9E|5.0|I already had How Do You Do and bought A Strange Arrangement in preparation for his concert. Happy I did-in many ways this one is better than his follow up album, but I like them both. I feel a little more soul in this one, although I like the singing better on How Do You Do. There are some real gems here: A Strange Arrangement, soulful heartfelt old school with a slight doo-wop feel to it. It slides right into Just Ain't Gonna Work Out which takes me back to the early 70's.<br />The Ills reminds of Marvin Gaye singing about the state of our world. Other faves are Maybe No, Maybe so and Shiny and New. Feel it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien films are some of my favorite and to have them on Blu-ray makes the experience of watching them again, better than before. The quality of the image allows to see all the details that were not visible before.<br />The two disc filled with behind the scenes and extras is really good, it's interesting to see how this whole world of the alien came to be.
0345803485|1.0|Words cannot describe how much I am disappointed in this absurd book.  I really cannot fathom how this is a mega-popular best-seller, and am left speechless on that note.<br /><br />Fifty Shades is nothing but repetition, repetition, repetition.  There is absolutely no regards for intellectual conversation, nor vacabulary, and every other page is sex, sex, and more sex.<br />Seriously, did a teenager write this book???<br /><br />Good thing I read it on Kindle, because if I read oh my, holy (insert various words here), my inner goddess, blushing, biting lip, etc, one more time on a paperbook, I would've screamed my lungs out and tear the book apart.<br /><br />If this is the type of writing required to be a best-seller, I am seriously in the wrong business.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible does live up to the hype.  The English Standard Version appears to be the legitimate modern successor to the King James Version.  I find the ESV translation to be very readable translation.  I used to use the NKJV or the RSV as a modern translation to use along with the KJV.  Shortly after the ESV was released, I picked up a hardcover copy and found myself reading the ESV translation most of the time.  I've thought about investing in a copy of the ESV for a couple of years.  When I saw that the ESV Study Bible was available for the Kindle for less than 10 bucks, I couldn't resist purchasing this bible as a resource.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information packed into this study bible.  A \\"golden horde\\" of Evangelical bible scholars contributed to the study notes, articles, introductions, and so forth.  As someone who likes to read all the articles in a study bible, I found this book to be jam-packed with useful information for the laymen and scholar alike.  J. I Packer, John Piper, and Wayne Grudem, three scholars for whom I have much respect, are among the contributors to this study Bible.<br /><br />As a former Pentecostal Holiness Christian who became a Muslim (12er Shia) about 13 years ago (yes, I realize this comment might earn me a few thumbs down), this is the study bible I would recommend to Muslims who want to read the Bible and learn what conservative Evangelical scholars have to say about what they believe the Bible teaches.  I thought the two articles that talked about Islam and spoke about the relationship between Christianity and Islam were very well written.  Islam is described mostly from the majority view (Sunni Islam), but the discussion of the similarities and differences between the two faiths was done in such a friendly manner that an Evangelical Christian encountering a 12er Shia Muslim for the first time, if all the information he or she had was just what was contained in the two articles, would be able to have a friendly discussion without the controversies that occur when misconceptions enter the conversation.  Muslims of all stripes many times have major misconceptions about what different kinds of Christians believe. Thus, the more information Muslims and Christians have about each other, the more likely useful dialogue can occur.  The ESV Study Bible would give Muslims much more than just an easy-to-read Bible translation and a concise overview of Evangelical Christian beliefs.  Indeed, a Muslim can receive a well rounded basic Evangelical Christian education that may help not only with casual encounters, but also help build relationships with conservative Evangelical in the neighborhood, on the job, and with joint community issues.<br /><br />Finally, I would also like to recommend the ESV MacArthur Study Bible to those Christians of a Calvinist Baptist heritage.  The eschatology is Pre-Millenial and Dispensational,but that should not be a problem to Amillenialists and Historic Pre-Millenialists. Besides, the Kindle version in also under 10 Bucks!ly discussion without the controversies that occur when misconceptions enter the conversation.

0345803493|5.0|Although I thoroughly enjoyed each book, this was my favorite! I wasn't expecting a love story with action, suspense, and \\"kinky f...ery\\" when I brought these books, but I boy am I happy! It's sad now that I've finished these addicting books in record time- I grew attached to Ana & Christian. Now, I'm recommending the trilogy to everyone & hoping that the casting director will not choose Kristen Stewart.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This is an outstanding movie.  The Blu-ray format is wonderful, and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I highly recommend it!
0439023513|3.0|When I first read this series I was like wow what a great book. But now I say the last two books were not bad but ok. I was epecting more from Collins but I was let down. The second book was a mess. The third book was a disaster. The plot of the story was drawn out and confusing. It was like a first grade story that was drawn out. Even though I didn't like Catching fire i still read Mockingjay because I wanted to know how the series ends, also Collins does the wrong thing at the end. She makes Catniss kill snow the she kills Coin. Whats up with that. I thought Coin was the good guy. Anyway i though Mockingjay was a bad way to end the series off. I mean the book wasn't even engaging. The first book was awesone and engaging. This book nor Catching fire had it. So I think the Hunger games series was ok because of the second and third book.
1401233384|2.0|The Flash is a great character, but I do not speak of Barry Allen but the Flash I grew up with: Wally West. Mind you, I have nothing against Barry Allen but I was one of the many who thought his death in Crisis on Infinite Earths was heroic and classic and even sacred. The decision to bring back Barry Allen, the first Flash, and the way in which it was done wasn't captivating, despite Geoff Johns' usually exceptional stewardship. Now, soon after a disjointed return of Barry, we've got Flashpoint that feels like a poor man's Age of Apocalypse.<br /><br />Marvel's AOA really set the bar for an \\"alternate universe\\" storyline. However, whereas AOA, aside from an initial issue and final issue (Prime & Omega), carried out its entire plot throughout the 4 issue individual series and worked to make a whole, the Flashback event is composed of both an all too short 5 issue, primary series collected in this volume and other ancillary 3 issue series not present here. It doesn't work. Blackest Night worked pretty well with such an interplay between supplementary titles and a core title, but they gave the core series 8 issues and extensive issues in Green Lantern related titles to explore the whole story. It felt epic. This does not.<br /><br />Sadly, the characterization and exploitation of the whole alternate universe conceit are not explored in the 5 issues collected in this volume. Interestingly, bonus pages are given at the end of this tome with sketches for many characters that appear for a frame or two only, who are never even named in the series and who do not speak. They may be important or interesting characters in the supplemental story lines, but are irrelevant here in the core title. In fact, their inclusion in this collected work illustrates the lack of planning and cohesion apparent throughout the entire series. This should be a fun \\"What If\\" story, but instead it limps along because there are really no interesting reinvented heroes. Flash is center stage and asidefrom the new Batman (more on that later), no one is really given satisfactory characterization or face time. Familiar and unfamiliar characters just appear and are who they are and do what they do for incomprehensible reasons.<br /><br />As to the storyline itself, it's uneventful, unnecessary, lacks causality and is actually preposterous, even within the comic book world. Spoiler: Through some time travel shenanigans Barry Allen's mother is saved from being murdered. As a result, the whole world is different. What? You're saying because there was no murder and no unsolved case to inspire Barry Allen to become the Flash that the whole world is completely messed up and different? How could such a change have such repercussions? We're never told why if even to simply reassert the necessity of Barry Allen as the Flash or make readers unfamiliar with him recognize his overall importance to the DC universe. As to the lack of inherent causality, take the re-imagined Batman. How would Barry's mother's death or life affect the Wayne family such that (Spoiler) in this alternate world Bruce died and his dad, Thomas Wayne, dons the cape and cowl? How would that life or death have made Aquaman and Wonder Woman tyrants? Granted, I didn't read all of the supplemental titles, but this is ridiculous. At least in AOA you actually had the death of a person, Professor X, whose absence from the universe really did come with grave and foreseeable repercussions.<br /><br />In the end, this feels like an undeveloped story that lacked the depth to fuel an entire event and could have just been done in the normal Flash comic book as a 5 issue arc with everything returning to normal and Barry learning a valuable lesson about attempts to change time. Everything about this book and the related books is arbitrary and lacks the imagination and whimsy of AOA. It's nothing more than a failed mechanism to justify the \\"New 52\\" reboot of the DC Universe. Kubert provides nice art as always but it's nothing we haven't seen him do before. This was a disappointing ride and an unnecessary segue between the the \\"old\\" DC universe and the \\"New 52.\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was glad to see that this is a free game but don't be fooled.  There is still plenty to pay for. if you want to play the game completely.  I still enjoy the game every day and I do not spend extra money.  This game is on a timer sort of so if you are hatching a baby you need to get back to it before it runs away.  There is no pause.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|The movie is outstanding. The Blu-ray format is perfect, making the Hawaiian scenery all the more beautiful.  It is a well done story, and I thoroughly enjjoyed it.  It is too bad that Cloony can't keep his politics private.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is a great reminder app. Very easy to use. You can create your own categories for bills or whatever. My favorite part is that you can keep track of your expenses without having to connect it to your bank account. Great reminder feature. I haven't forgotten a bill since I started using it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid reader and I usually get bored really quickly with this type of book but I was surprised at how good this series was.  No this isn't one of the great writers of our time but the story was fun and vivid.  If you are looking for a fun summer read, this is a good choice.  With all the hype surrounding this series it could have gotten really bad really quick and it didn't. Also the writer chose some very good descriptive words and increased my vocabulary with some of her word choices. You may also walk away with a few fun ideas to try with your significant other!! HAPPY READING!!
B00514HDNW|5.0|Ok, I actually liked all of the movies ([[ASIN:B0013FBS20 I Am Legend [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]], and [[ASIN:B0017XETMO The Omega Man]]) that were based on this classic story, but none of them really do full justice to the book.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: the story centers on Robert Neville, perhaps the last \\"normal\\" man alive. Neville faces nightly torment from a horde of \\"vampires\\" and spends his days gathering supplies and hunting down the vampires when he can find them. This not an action centric tale, but rather a somewhat deeper look into the mind of a man driven by loneliness and torment, but still holding on to a glimmer of hope for the future.<br /><br />Matheson does great a job setting the tone and moving the story along in a surprisingly succinct and \\"mater of fact\\" way, making this a fairly short, but very enjoyable read. This still holds up nicely after all these years!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH<br /><br />Note: that title quote was borrowed from a friend, I only wish I was that clever!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very helpful. I found the \\"story\\" approach interesting. I didn't get bogged down and actually finished this book ( usually don't). I had never heard of the CUE -> ROUTINE -> REWARD approach to habits, and I find it transformational. Definitely recommended if you're not quite sure why you do what you do, even when you don't want to.<br /><br />Update:  Having read a few of the \\"blistering\\" reviews of this book, I wanted to add that I think many readers are expecting too much.  This is not a difficult book to read, but it is interesting, and engaging if you just like to read.  I do, and it's why I actually finished this one. The cue-routine-reward cycle he discusses is really the essence of the book, and that alone is worth the reading.  I didn't get much else from it, but that was enough.<br /><br />Please, please, download the free \\"Sample\\" chapter before you buy a book, and then want to see it \\"burned.\\"
B005DC68NI|5.0|I was on the fence over the whole self-publishing debate; David's book not only convinced me to pull the trigger, it saved me a significant amount of time and effort in finding information that was crucial to my own effort.  It's a perfect combination of inspirational and practical, and I highly recommend it to any author considering going down the self-publishing route.
1606865617|4.0|I read this book for one of my women's literature classes, and it was one of my favorites. I particularly liked how the author gave a clear insight into the Indian lifestyle from the 1970s-1990s. There's a focus on the caste system, Syrian Christianity, communism, and British imperialism in this book. That being said, the forbidden love and extreme Anglophilia add to the interest level of this book. I did not care for the repetition of random phrases throughout the book or the twist of plot with the twins.

B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Data from the Starship Enterprise has been transformed into Loki, the Norse god who, for some reason, decides to conquer Earth, using an alien race, in exchange for Rubik's Cube, which is now monochromatic. For some reason he cannot come to Earth, like his brother Thor, so he has been waiting for mortals to tinker with Rubik's Cube, which transports him to the planet. He does so, takes the Cube and bends a number of people to his will in order to play with the Cube so that a portal car be opened to allow the aliens to come in.<br /><br />For some reason, he then goes to Stuttgart to rip out an eye from an individual (apparently it has to be a German eye) to give to an archer that he has converted. An archer, you see, is crucial in the forthcoming battle employing spaceships, jet planes, tanks, and ray guns. At that point, for some reason, he lets himself get captured by Thor and Iron Man. He is taken to an enormous aircraft carrier the size of a small city that nobody in the world knows about or has somehow overlooked. At that point, for some reason, it is decided that the aircraft carrier must go up in the air, at which point, gigantic fans (yes, fans! Why didn't they use gigantic wings) lift it up. Then, while going aimlessly in the air, the now collected Avengers, brought together by a black Nick Fury (who was actually supposed to be white, but we might as well be Politically Correct), for some reason, now become hostile to one another. At this point, mega-archer appears, supposedly with his third eye implanted somewhere (maybe his rear end), and with his bow and ONE ARROW brings down the supercarrier whereupon Loki, who wanted to be captured for some reason, now for some reason, escapes.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, Loki, having seen the Transformer films, goes on top of a building and has his machine turn on, at which point, the invasion begins. The invasion even has huge transformers leveling buildings (the aliens saw the same movies). The Avengers, for somereason having forgotten their previous hostility, band together and predictably fight off the invasion, helped tremendously by a 98-lb girl with a pop gun in each hand firing at mechanical leviathans.<br /><br />The special effects are standard, in that they are excellent, and that always brings in the crowds. A lot of the bantering between the characters, particularly coming from Iron Man, is great and that makes up a little bit for some of the drawbacks. Don't misunderstand me: the movie is as entertaining as it is stupid.
0345803485|1.0|This is the first time I have seen a print edition cost LESS then the Kindle edition. There is no reason for this except calculated greed on the part of Amazon. I am so disappointed. I thought ebooks heralded the beginning of something good for everyone.. the environment, authors publishers, readers. Instead... here we go.. the big money grab. I want to read the books even if it's just to see what all the hype is about.. but I'm going to wait to borrow them from someone or buy them in a second-hand bookstore just out of principle. Shame on you, Amazon.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|...and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. What now? It's a nice reboot for the franchise with a very-meta bent. This package is particular cool, as it comes with Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and a soundtrack. Disney continues to do an awesome job with home video releases.
0061438294|5.0|The book arrived way before the expected time and in great conditions. Excellent! It was a gift and it arrived before the date which made it a great experience.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I admit, I was a bit scared to try it because I heard how hardcore it was. This DVD is tough! I definitely don't think it's for beginners and you should probably start with something a bit easier (try Jeanette Jenkin's 21 Day Total Body Circuit). However, this DVD is great! It was great for my busy schedule and I loved that it was short enough that I could use and add on to another DVD.<br /><br />Unlike other people, I didn't do this DVD everyday for 30 days. I alternated between this one and doing cardio on my exercise bike, or this DVD and other JM DVDs. This seemed to be way more effective for me, as I lost a pound a week once I started alternating. Sometimes I even did all three levels at once. However, no matter what my technique was, I saw my abs start poking out and legs and arms get more defined.<br /><br />Since purchasing this DVD I've gotten pretty much every Jillian DVD and I LOVE it. I love her and love the tough love and great results she promised. I recommend this DVD to anyone looking to get toned and shed some inches. LOVE YOU JILLIAN!

0307279189|4.0|Christopher McDougall tells a compelling tale of super athletes and his own quest to find the best distance runners in the world. Real life accounts are interspersed with scientific evidence about the upright running human and examines the use of padded running shoes and injuries. I couldn't put this book down,  I found it very inspiring and it has rejuvenated my husband and I to begin running again.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|by the rest of these reviews its too much money and kindle fire doesnt have it free yet... i think at least for the delevopers can do is have a 1 day free for people who want to buy it or let them play 1 section of it
B0080CL0HM|2.0|Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci make this movie. Very good performances by those two, especially Thurman, but this lead \\"actor\\" is horrendous! What a waste of ten bucks. This guy can't act to save his life. The story line is boring. It's tolerable if you enjoy period films, and again, Thurman makes it, but seriously - otherwise, a total waste of time.
075695195X|4.0|Jonathan Stroud has a talent for description and setting, and I enjoyed his take on what a magician's apprenticeship might be like in an alternate world.  Stroud's Europe is divided into magician and commoners.  Magicians (the elite) control djinn, afrit, marids, and imps as slaves, and these creatures would enjoy tearing their masters apart if bound incorrectly.  Commoners are an oppressed underclass containing the rest of humanity.  Stroud gets the world-building right.  I could picture everything, and he uses the perspectives of Nathaniel (the ambitious, smart, neglected apprentice) and Bartimaeus (the 5010 year old wily Djinn with a cynical sense of humor) as they navigate through Nathaniel's apprenticeship.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the Amulet of Samarkand, an immensely strong protective token.  Nathaniel steps into a huge political mess when he orders Bartimaeus to steal it.<br /><br />Even though this book was YA, I found it equal with many adult fantasy novels I've read in terms of realized world, magical systems, and plot movement.  Recommended for all ages.

0393088774|5.0|In this book America's pre-eminent econcomist, Paul Krugman, offers his prescription for ending the depression that has been afflicting this country for five years. We know what to do,  says Krugman, because the problems we have are recognizably similar to those of the 1930s. \\"Unfortunately we are not using the nowledge we have because too many people who matter - politicians, public officials, and the broader class of writers and talkers who define conventional wisdom - have, for a variety of reasons, chosen to forget the lessons of history and the conclusions of several generations' worth of economic analysis, replacing the hard won knowledge with ideologically and politically convenient prejudices. Above all, conventional wisdom among what some of us have taken to referring to, sarcastically, as Very Serious People has completely thrown away Keynes central dictum: \\"The boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity.\\" Now is the time for government to spend more not less, until the private sector is ready to carrry the economy forward again - yet job-destroying austerity policies have instead become the rule.\\"<br /><br />One of the problems is long term unemployment. But Republican dogma says there is no such thing (ask Sharon Angle) - that anyone who wants a job can get one. Humorously, Krugman points out that the classic answer to such people comes from a passage near the beginning of the novel \\"The Treasure of Sierra Madre'' (the film starred Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston): \\"Anyone who is willing to work and is serious about it will certainly find a job. Only you must not go to the man who tells you this, for he has no job to offer and doesn't know anyone who knows of a vacancy. This is exactly the reason why he gives you such generous advice, out of brotherly love, and to demonstrate how little he knows of the world..\\"<br /><br />Also, to those Chicago Board of Trade people who mocked anti-equality demonstrators by showering them with copies of MacDonald'sjob application forms advertising 50,000 new job openings, Krugman points out that roughly one million people applied!.<br /><br />In a chapter entitled \\"Anatomy of An Inadequate Response\\", Krugman points out that the predicament Obama now finds himself in is largely of his own making. Whether he could have provided bold, innovative leadership like FDR in the 1930s is problematic. He didn' even try. His stimulus package was far too small for the job. While it mitigated the recession, it fell far short of what would have been needed to restore full employment, or even to create a sense of progress. There was nothing resembling an FDR-style Works Progress Administration. (At its peak the WPA employed three million Americans or about 10 percent of the workforce. An equivalent sized program today would employ thirteen million workers.) In answer to the question whether such a program was politically possible, Krugman says that his own take is that the politics of adequate stimulus were very hard, but we will never know whether they really prevented an adequate plan because Obama and his aides never even tried for something big enough to do the job. I would also like to point out that FDR does not seem to be one of Obama's heroes (at least he never talks about him.) On the other hand we do know that Obama considers Ronald Reagan to be the most transformative president of our times!<br /><br />Krugman does address the problems of the deficit and inflation - the hobgoblins of Republican minds. First of all, he says, there was and is no evidence to support the shift in focus away from jobs and towards deficits. \\"Where the harm done by lack of jobs is real and terrible, the harm done by deficits to a nation like America in its current situation is, for the most part, hypothetical. The quantifiable burden of debt is much smaller than you would imagine from the rhetoric and warnings about some kind of debt crisis are based on nothing much at all. In fact, the predictions of the deficit hawks have been repeatedly falsified by events, while those who argued that deficits are not a problem in a depressed economy have been constantly right. Yet exaggerated fear of deficits retains its hold on our political and policy discourse.\\"<br /><br />For the past few years - especially since the election of Obama - the airwaves and opinion pages have been filled with dire warnings of high inflation just around the corner. Some have even predicted a full fledged hyperinflation along the lines of the Weimer Republic in the 1920s. The right side of the political spectrum has bught fully into theses fears of inflation. Ron Paul, a self-proclaimed devotee of Austrian economics, routinely issues apocalyptic warnings about inflation. The failure of his presidential aspirations should not blind us to his success in making his economic ideology Republican orthodoxy. Republican congressman berate Ben Bernanke for \\"debasing\\" the dollar and their presidential candidates compete over who can denounce the Feds allegedly inflationary policies most vehemently. But they are wrong. Three and a half years after the election of Obama the interest rate is still near zero. The Fed has continued to buy bonds and mortgages, adding even more to bank reserves; and budget deficits remain enormous. Yet the averge inflation rate over that period was only 2.5 percent, and if you included volatile food and energy prices, the average inflation rate was only 1.4 percent. The inflation rates were below historical norms. In particular, as liberal economists love to point out, inflation was much lower under Obama than it had been in Ronald Reagan's supposedly halcyon, \\"morning in America\\" second term.<br /><br />This book, then, says Krugman, is an attempt to break the hold of that destructive conventional wisdom and to make the case for the expansionary, job-creating policies we should have been following all along. \\"I am trying to go over the heads of the Serious People who have, forwhatever reason, taken all of us down the wrong path, at immense cost to our economies and our societies, and to appeal to an informed public opinion in an effort to get us doing the right thing instead.\\"<br /><br />Krugman' optimism is obvious on almost every page and he thinks that this job can be done - although it will be difficult \\"These are terrible times, and all the more terrible because it's all so unnecessary. But don't give up: we can end this depression, if we can only find the clarity and the will.\\"
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Personally I thought this book was very weak and lacking!! Some of the emails and negotiating between the lovers were a little funny but there is nothing great to this book. The writing in first person is so boring with all the \\"I did this\\" and \\"he did that.\\" I didn't get lost in the scenery of things because there is no setting up, hardly any descriptions scene to scene. As for the extremely weak female Sub character hot & bothered one second and then putting up with the b.s. of the Dom, ugh, was soooo stupid! Just a bunch of back & forth crap, ending with more of the same in book #2. Book was drawn out and characters were a bore!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help is refreshing, funny and very entertaining.  Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer were superb, and Sissy Spacek's Mrs. Walters was simply hilarious.  This is definitely a \\"must have\\" movie not simply to see once, but a least a couple of times--it is that good!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|It is my least favorite angry birds game.  It just doesn't make sense at times.  Challenging to keep my attention.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Awesome movie.  I'm a Daniel Craig fan, and he didn't disappoint in this movie.  Newcomer Rooney Mara was extremely convincing in her role as an outcast and victim who turns the tables on her abuser.  Can't wait for the next movie in the trilogy to come out!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|amazing, addicting, quick read. I downloaded this book because \\"all the cool kids where doing it\\" (i gave into peer pressure). it was well worth the time and $. would highly recommend that you give into the peer pressure and download this book!!
B004EPYZUS|3.0|This movie is average at best--not one of the better mission impossible offerings with Cruise.  The action is good, with breath-taking, unbelievable stunts that almost make you forget that the plot is weak. I'm was surprised they put Paula Patton in a role that called for more sex appeal and edginess.  Patton always comes across as a nonagressive, good-girl type and very boring.  Zoe Saldana would have been perfect for the role.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like that you can add your own picture. The customization is cool. It's also easy to use. Yup yup.
0439023521|5.0|I love the book and the trilogy. This is definitely one of the best books I have read or will ever read. Suzanne Collins is the BEST AUTHOR EVER!!! I recommend the book to all of my friends, and practically everyone I meet. Trust me, get this book, you will NOT regret it!!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|This movie has quite a rewrite of Sherlock Holmes. In this he is an action hero,  fighting physically and a joker. As a character quite different than the one expects of Holmes. Much of his performance just seemed so out of character that it ruined the story for me. I confess I did not like it.<br /><br />The best actor by far who was was Jared Harris who played very well. I thought he did a good job playing Moriarty. Not that I thought that anyone acted badly. They all did their bit.<br /><br />The filming was good. The action scenes well done<br /><br />The story itself, I thought was weak, full of holes that made it unrealistic.<br /><br />I think the script writers for me, let it down.
1593272839|5.0|I downloaded this book as a free pdf from the book's website initially. After reading through a significant portion of the pdf, I decided to purchase the print version in order to have a handy chunk of dead tree to use (I prefer dead tree versions of books, generally speaking) and to support the author, because I thought the cook was simply fabulous.<br /><br />I must admit, first, that  I had previous exposure to functional programming (in the context of scheme), so my review may be a bit biased. That being said, I felt that this book did an amazing job at providing a very informal, well paced introduction to both the Haskell language and functional programming in general. Unlike most of your \\"for dummies\\" books (as well as all of the similar variations of that general genre), however, you won't be insulted by ridiculously dumbed-down explanations or suffer from way too many forced puns, jokes, etc. The author does take a very lighthearted approach, employ humor, etc., but it seems much more natural and is much less obnoxious than most books which attempt to take such a route.
B006P0FIGU|2.0|I did not see this in 3D which I am sure was a great loss here. I would suggest seeing it in 3D.<br /><br />The film itself has some ridiculous story lines and going by the ending has a sequel planned.<br /><br />The story itself basically follows the original. Since I knew the original story, I knew what was going to happen. I think it ruined much of it for me.<br /><br />None of the characters, I thought were particularly interesting. The acting I thought was average.<br /><br />The actual filming was brilliant. The colors, the buildings, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes, all very good.<br /><br />The action scenes were reasonable. What struck me was the lack of blood in them. People getting hit by swords but no blood. It seemed so fake.<br /><br />The air balloon and air battles all looked out of place.<br /><br />Overall, it is probably not fair me judging it as it is a kid's movie.
B0031RS69G|5.0|This book is a solid fantasy read. It has great characters, a plot that whisks you away, and a downright funny commentary on societal quirks. Rincewind, Twoflower and The Chest are some of the best buddy adventurers I have ever read. It caused me to buy the next three in Terry Pratchett's line within two weeks (and finished them all too). I was late to discover this book, this author and the Discworld; but I am oh so glad I finally did! WARNING: There are over 30 books in the Discworld series with many more yet to come - so be prepared to want them all after reading 'The Colour of Magic'.
B004UBM4TA|2.0|i was expecting something way better than this.  it was not as bad as \\"the grand canyon, river at risk\\" but it wasn't much better either.<br />all in all, i'm not going to buy any more of these \\"educational\\" 3d blu rays.  they've pretty much all been disappointing.  i'm only going to buy actual 3d movies.
0439023521|5.0|I don't know if it was originally intended for the ears of children but I definitely wouldn't let my kids read / listen to it. However, having said that, I absolutely loved all three of these books. I have never read a book so quickly in my life! Engaging, riveting and powerful. Buy it!
B0038JN6VA|5.0|This X-mini speaker is a very nice item to have anywhere you are. I rate this a 6 out of a 5! It's very nice looking and the blue speaker inside really pops and gives it a really nice look. The sound quality is very nice and crisp and a pleasure to hear and listen to. The speaker can either run in the collapsed position or the extended position. In the extended position it is supposed to have more bass and a deeper sound and a better sound quality, and I can really tell the different! But extended or collapsed, its an around good sounding speaker! The most unique feature about this speaker is that you can charge it up, leave your phone inside to charge and enjoy the speaker's mp3 player through the SD card that you can put your favorite songs on!  The accessories include a nice soft black carry on bag, some average but good sounding headphones, and a cord for charging the speaker. No SD card in my purchase, but im not complaining I had plenty of them and if you don't there cheep. All my friends and family I show this too, they all give this a 5 star rating! So that all being said, if you are looking for a nice convenient device, big sound for the size and nice quality sound, or just something to take with you the beach, pool or just to plug into your phone or laptop at home or anywhere you are, than this is the speaker for you! I recommend this speaker!

This book is addictive, could not put it down, I read it in two (2) days and still wanted more......Hoping to get Books two and three today.<br />Am also hoping for a movie with either Robert Pattinson, Ian Somerhalder or Thomas Dekker as Christian Grey, have not made a choice for \\"Ana\\" as yet.<br />If you're not into the erotica romance stuff,then this book is not for you, it's different strokes for different folks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|I haven't actually played the dvd's yet, but they were a great deal! The only downside is the cheap packaging. They are all together, stacked on one 'pole'. I solved this problem easily though by placing them all in a zipup DVD carrying case.

B007SGM084|1.0|I don't only blame Amazon, but also the publishers for trying to capitalize on the popularity of this book.<br /><br />But, they have it all wrong! They would sell more and make MORE money if the price was significantly lower.<br /><br />If it were me, I'd make it 'buy the first two, get the third free' to get more sales.  Anybody who buys at this price is silly.<br /><br />Anyway, I have so many books on my Kindle that I can wait until the price comes down or just borrow  a hard copy from a friend or the library.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|great app! one of my favorites. one if the main the reasons I love my kindle. def a highly recommended app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE this book. I have been looking for something to grab my attention and get me reading this book was it. Weather your into BDSM or not you will fall in love with this book!
0439023513|5.0|I have to admit, that when I first read this book, I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that it was to rushed, and I was unsatisfied with how it ended, I wanted more. Then I decided to reread the series, which just got better the second time around. When I finished Mockingjay. for the second time, I had completely fallen in love with the third book. I now understand why the events that unfolded had to happen.  This book brought a different tone, then the other two. I still feel that the author could have slowed down the ending, and maybe go into greater detail, it is still to rushed. But all in all it is probably my favorite out of the trilogy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didnt really want to read these books at all then everyone at my work was talking about them so I thought what the heck OMG I am so glad that I did they are an amazing read. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to re-read them :)
B001NHNG64|4.0|I have just started reading Lee Child novels.  I have read Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett, CJ Box, etc, and was looking for more material.  Jack Reacher is a great character and this is the second Lee Child book that I have read.  They are fun, easy reads and generally keep you interested and turning the pages.  It is particularly interesting how Reacher calculates his moves in his head. I am looking forward to the next one as they are being read in order of publication and I am certain that I will eventually buy them all.  Highly recommended for a fun read.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I bought the first disc as soon as it hit the stores, this 3 disc came out and I am in total heaven. I love the extended scenes, and the making of on the special disc. I do not use blu ray and the third disc is great. My only complaint is it's not CC so I have to get my husband to \\"translate\\" for me. I do wish they could have put the dream time and the after where Neyteri is pregnant on the film....but I see their problems. As an extended version it is a bloody long film. Things have to be cut some where. I do like the death of Tsu Tey as I think it shows a \\"passage\\" when Jake becomes their leader. All in all I can NOT recommend Avatar enough. Anyone that enjoys animation has got to love this, especially the parts on the third disc which show the actors in the motion capture costumes. Absolutely spectacular film
B000SEI230|5.0|I know a lot of people do not like this book as much as the other things the Sparks has written. It seems to me that they might relate to thosoe books better because of the age of the people. This one really connected with me but I am close to their age. My absolute favorite book!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This set is really impressive; 2 new kinds of sandtroopers, a new swoop bike, two movie-accurate droid, and a well-designed escape pod.  I bought the Droid Escape from 2001, but this one is so much better.  The minifigures are the best!

B0068FYZZW|4.0|Purchased this for my girlfriend as a gift.  Honestly, on a movie of this age with this type of setting I find Blu-Ray is not an upgrade.  The digital copy is handy to put on our tablet to watch where ever she wants.  The DVD copy is great to loan out to people, as nobody enjoys when your loaning friends lets their kids scratch up your discs.

B001PA0FFO|4.0|Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius Beauvier, principal of an urban Catholic school in 1964. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Brendan Flynn, the parish priest. Joseph Foster II plays Donald Miller, the first black student in the school and an altar boy. Amy Adams plays his history teacher, Sister James.<br /><br />Ah, you're getting the picture already, aren't you?<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is suspicious of Father Flynn, although she does not specify why. It's not just the sermon he gives on the topic of Doubt, but as she puts it, \\"I know people.\\" Indeed she does, but we may be left with a question as to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Father Flynn is only slightly indiscreet, and can cover his behavior with lies. But one lie (I'm trying not to give away too much) leaves the boy taking punishment for something that was really Father Flynn's doing.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius asks Donald's parents to come and talk with her, but only his mother shows up. She reveals some important facts about what's going on, as well as her attitude toward the situation and her husband's. The audience has no choice but to conclude that this boy is in a total trap. There is nothing, literally nothing, he can do to improve his situation.<br /><br />The same cannot be said of Sister Aloysius. And I will leave it there so as to avoid ruining the conclusion. In the very end, she is sitting in the courtyard which is covered with snow when Sister James finds her, and talks over with her exactly what happened. Her last line is \\"I have such doubts. Such doubts.\\"<br /><br />It's a moving story, but it's hard to know with whom to sympathize, who to blame. It's just a very tragic story. However, I did decide who to blame: the bishop.

B003NF0G12|5.0|I'm madly in love with Sean Connery. But I think this movie also made me love Rob Brown, except of course he's way too young for me.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that's thoughtful rather than action-packed. OK, there are some basketball highlights here and there, but I could tolerate those because they were only highlights, and they even had enough respect for those of us who know almost nothing about the game to make it clear what was happening. After all, even I know that the point is to put the ball through the hoop.<br /><br />Jamal (Rob Brown) is 16. He's in a Bronx public school where he gets C-average grades and plays basketball very well. But New York state has proficiency tests they give to high school students, and the test gives away Jamal's big secret: he's very, very smart. His mother said he loves to read, and he is always writing something in these little notebooks he carries around. But she didn't know he was that kind of smart. In fact, he's so smart that a toney Manhattan private school wants him to come to them on complete scholarship, and of course play basketball for them as well.<br /><br />In an old apartment building (or perhaps a co-op; it's never clear) near where Jamal and his friends play basketball, there's an old man who looks out the window, and the kids all have these legends about him. He's a murderer who's hiding out. He was responsible for the disappearance of a teenage girl who lived in the building. They rarely see him, but they know he's at the window and he's watching them.<br /><br />One day, his friends dare Jamal to sneak into the old man's apartment and bring something out to prove he was in. He goes up the fire escape and in a window, and finds himself in a book-filled apartment. He sees an interesting curved knife on the desk, and has just zipped it up into his back pack then the old man (Sean Connery) suddenly pops up out of nowhere and scares him so bad he forgets his back pack and runs out of the apartment.<br /><br />The next day, his back pack is hanging in the window. When he fails to take the bait and go up for it, he finds it is thrown down onto the basketball court. When he gets home and unpacks his notebooks, and finds they are covered in comments, some extremely complimentary of his writing, some less so. He decides to go back and talk to the old man. But the old man puts him off, saying (through the locked door) that he should write 5,000 words on why he is going to leave the old guy alone. Oddly enough, Jamal does write such an essay, and takes it back.<br /><br />Little by little, Jamal and the old man become friends. Then when his English teacher at the prep school assigns the one novel by William Forrester, his wealthy friend gets a first edition and Jamal sees a photo of the young William Forrester. Sure enough, his old friend is William Forrester. (One advantage of using a very recognizable actor with a long career for such a story is plenty of good photos of him as a young man are available for such things.)<br /><br />Why is Forrester hiding from the world? Why did he only ever write that one excellent novel when he was in his 20s, and then never another? Why does he now undertake to help Jamal learn to write? Forrester does not want to talk about himself, but eventually we learn the answers to all these questions, and a few more we didn't know were there. Will the sweet young lady who just happens to be the daughter of one of the trustees defy her lily-white father and fall in love with Jamal? Will Jamal take the team to the regional championship? What could possibly induce Forrester to come out of his apartment?<br /><br />[See if you recognize Forrester's lawyer toward the end of the film.]<br /><br />It's a marvelous movie, very heart-warming and intelligent. Try not to let the basketball get in the way. Five stars, really.r /><br />The next day, his back pack is hanging in the window.

Sure enough, his old friend is William Forrester. (One advantage of using a very recognizable actor with a long career for such a story is plenty of good photos of him as a young man are available for such things.)<br /><br />Why is Forrester hiding from the world? Why did he only ever write that one excellent novel when he was in his 20s, and then never another? Why does he now undertake to help Jamal learn to write? Forrester does not want to talk about himself, but eventually we learn the answers to all these questions, and a few more we didn't know were there. Will the sweet young lady who just happens to be the daughter of one of the trustees defy her lily-white father and fall in love with Jamal? Will Jamal take the team to the regional championship? What could possibly induce Forrester to come out of his apartment?<br /><br />[See if you recognize Forrester's lawyer toward the end of the film.]<br /><br />It's a marvelous movie, very heart-warming and intelligent. Try not to let the basketball get in the way. Five stars, really.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith certainly gets the interesting science fiction action pictures, doesn't he? This is one of the best he's done. The closing credits say it was \\"suggested by\\" Asimov's story. But those of us who remember the story will remember that it was a short story, one of several in a book by the same name, but not anything long enough to be a feature-length movie out of it. Still, the necessary elements are there, and what's been made of them would make old Isaac proud.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago cop of the not-too-distant future, when robots are becoming very common in society, and everyone knows the three laws of robotics:<br /><br />1. A robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.<br />2. A robot must obey the orders of a human unless they conflict with Rule One.<br />3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Rule One or Two.<br /><br />Asimov has promulgated these three laws for long enough that most science fiction fans are familiar with them. We are also familiar with stories written about attempts to circumvent this hard-wired programming. So when a famous robotic designer is found fallen out of his office window onto the marble atrium below, everyone assumes it was suicide, because no one was in the office with him at the time. But Spooner is suspicious of robots (we find out why eventually), and figures the scientist was murdered, possibly by a robot. Sure enough, an apparently out of control robot is discovered in his office, and Spooner figures it for the killer. But of course everyone, including Dr. Susan Calvin, robot psychologist, tells him that's just not possible.<br /><br />Now, this really is a mystery, and the clues lead everywhere and nowhere, so I don't want to ruin it for you. Let's just say that almost no one in this film is what they seem to be at first, except perhaps Spooner's granny. And don't be too sure about her, either.<br /><br />It's a real hardware movie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested. The man is buffed!ie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested. The man is buffed!

B000LXH0AE|2.0|You know, I really didn't expect to like this movie. For one thing, I'm no big fan of Will Ferrell, who plays the lead. But then Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are also in it, and I like both of them, so I'm game. Besides, the movie was given to me. Now, that might have been because the original owner was disappointed in it, or for some other reason. Ah well, I had time to kill this afternoon.<br /><br />The first ten or fifteen minutes lived up to my expectations, but eventually, it started getting better. By the end, I couldn't help being touched. It's a very, very weird movie, but a thoughtful one in significant spots. And just the thing for a philosophy major.<br /><br />Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent with no life to speak of outside of his job, and his job is pretty darn boring, too. Did I say no life to speak of? Then why is someone speaking of it? Narrating it, actually, in a female voice with an elegant British accent (Emma Thompson). OK, he's hearing voices. After a really mad talk with someone in his office (a resident therapist? Someone from the Department of Human Resources? It's not clear.), he does the rational thing and goes to a therapist. The therapist says it's schizophrenia, but he says the voice isn't telling him to do anything, it's just narrating his life as if he was a character in a book.<br /><br />Turns out he is. He goes to see literature profession Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who decides he's got to find out what sort of book he's in, figure out who the author is, and contact her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two other things are going on. Karen Eiffel, his author (Emma Thompson), is suffering writer's block and can't figure out how to kill off her main character. Her publisher sends her an assistant (Queen Latifah), who pledges she will help her in any way she can, but she's never yet failed to get an author to complete a work on time. So with unflappable calm, she goes to considerable lengths to help Eiffel, but nothing seems to work.<br /><br />The second thing that's going on is that Harold is falling in love. A rather hippie-like young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) runs a bakery shop and has neglected to pay a part of her taxes in protest against the way the government spends it on the military budget. So Harold's job is to audit her records for the last three years, and she presents them to him all jumbled together in a cardboard box. She admits she normally keeps very tidy records, but she did this to annoy him. She thinks she really hates him because he's the IRS. But the author knows, and eventually Harold knows (the voice in his head) that they are falling in love.<br /><br />So Harold must find Karen Eiffel and persuade her to change the book's ending and not kill him off. Does he do it? I can't ruin the outcome for you; that would be cruel.<br /><br />The metaphysics is a little hard to follow, especially when you've had just enough education to follow the lack of logic. I daresay a moderately intelligent teenager with no higher education to cause him or her to think about it too hard would find this a wonderful movie. I'll just say I enjoyed it somewhat, and admired the Eiffel ending, even if Professor Hilbert was a little disappointed.s to work.<br /><br />The second thing that's going on is that Harold is falling in love.

B001DPHDCY|4.0|I love Dr. Seuss, and always will. But not having any children, I don't always come into contact with his stories until well after everyone knows everything about them. I remember Horton from when he hatched an egg, but this is the first I've gone to Whoville. (Or is it? Wasn't that also the name of the people from whom the Grinch stole Christmas?)<br /><br />Jim Carrey does a great job as the voice of Horton, but the real personality is more in the animation than the voice. He's absolutely lovable! He's funny and just a little crazy, but not nearly as crazy as the know-it-all kangaroo who is convinced he is crazy. She believes Horton is a bad influence on the children of the jungle because he's encouraging them to use their imagination. That's why she's pouch-schooling her son.<br /><br />Whoville is on a tiny speck on a clover and nobody but Horton can hear the Whos. So there's some obvious back and forth about is Horton crazy for believing in the Whos, or is the Mayor of Whoville crazy for believing in Horton? Some funny digs get in there about religion, philosophy, maybe even molecular physics. Also about politics (the way Whoville runs, and also the way the jungle community runs), and all sorts of things. Some are no doubt part of Dr. Seuss' book, but I'm betting that a good bit of it comes from the animators. Especially the brilliant physical jokes. Never simply slapstick, they are nonetheless the sort that would hurt plenty if you weren't a cartoon.<br /><br />If you have kids, you probably already know the book. Maybe you already know and love this movie. If not, take your earliest opportunity to see it, but be prepared to laugh until you get hiccups.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|This is a genuine tear-jerker but, as Angelina Jolie says in the special feature interview, it is the fact that it is a true story that makes the difference. If it was fiction, nobody would bother with it. It would sound too contrived, too improbable. It is, however, true.<br /><br />Jolie plays Christine Collins, a Los Angeles single mom in 1928 who comes home one day in March from an extra stint of work (supervisor at the phone company) to find her 9-year-old son Walter is missing. She searches the neighborhood and then calls the police, who say they can't do anything until 24 hours, because most kids just come home. Nonetheless, a policeman is there the next morning, taking the information, and assuring her that they will be looking for Walter. Still, nothing much seems to be happening. Finally, in August, she gets a visit from the investigator on her case (and apparently several reporters) telling her they have found her son and he's on his way home from the midwest where he was in the company of a drifter.<br /><br />But when she gets to the train station, she discovers that the boy is not her son, although he claims his name is Walter Collins. She is pressured to take him home, and guilt-tripped by being told \\"he has nobody but you, nowhere else to go.\\" She takes him home and when he takes a bath, she discovers he is circumcised, while Walter was not. She puts him against the doorway where she had marked Walter's height not long before he disappeared, and this kid is at least three inches shorter. So who is he and why are the police and everyone else insisting he is her son?<br /><br />You wouldn't want me to spoil the story, would you?<br /><br />Let's just say this poor woman went through hell trying to find out what became of her son. A local minister, played by John Malkovich, tries to help her, and believes she is not insane as the police insist. He has been crusading against the corrupt police force for years, and knows what happens to people who embarrass them. She is effectively insisting that they admit they made a mistake (or even perpetrated a fraud) in bringing her a boy who was not her son.<br /><br />It's a pretty grim story, all told, but you can't help admiring Christine Collins and her determination. She eventually wins several courtroom battles, but does she get her son back? I'm not going to spoil it. Watch it.ss them.

B0009IOR6Q|3.0|This is a cross between \\"Grease\\" and every Elvis Presley movie ever made, but especially \\"Jailhouse Rock.\\"<br /><br />Johnny plays Cry-Baby Walker, an orphan raised by his grandmother (Susan Tyrrell) who deals in stolen car parts, after his parents were executed as the \\"Alphabet Bombers.\\" He has a tattoo of an electric chair on his chest and freaks out at lightening. Grandma Ramona's boyfriend for the last ten years is Belvedere, played by Iggy Pop.<br /><br />The good girl who goes bad for him is Allison Vernon-Williams, a rich kid raised by her way too proper grandmother (Polly Bergen), who runs a charm school where the motto is the four Bs: Beauty, Brains, Breeding and Bounty!<br /><br />Of course, Allison has a square boyfriend that her grandmother does approve of, Baldwin by name (Stephen Mailer), who is a perfect ass, and not above vandalizing the Drapes (what juvenile delinquents were called in Baltimore in those days, for no discernible reason) cars and Cry-Baby's beautiful brand new motorcycle.<br /><br />Cry-Baby's gang is also his rock 'n roll band, including his pregnant sister Pepper (Ricki Lane), Wanda the all-talk-and-no-show bad-girl blond (Traci Lords), Hatchet Face (Kim McGuire), who wears makeup you simply will not believe, and Hatchet's boyfriend Milton (Darren E. Burrows).<br /><br />The other kids' parents are at least as outrageous in their ways as Ramona and Belvedere, and you may recognize some faces. Wanda's father and mother, the Wonder Bread squares, are played by David Nelson and Patricia Hearst! Hatchet's parents sell cigarettes in front of the school after hours, using all the cliche come-ons associated with selling grass in Reefer Madness. Milton's parents are evangelistic Christians; his mother (Joey Heatherton) even speaks in tongues!<br /><br />The movie manages to poke fun at just about every available cliche about 1950s teenagers, and the band really can rock. It's all good clean (?) fun.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|If  you are a fan of this show, this production is breathtaking and beautifully done!! I've seen the Broadway show twice and it pales by comparison to the anniversary show. I recommend it highly to anyone who loves Phantom of the Opera!
B0007TKNII|4.0|This is going to be a little different from my usual reviews, because I have been reading the book and then just got the movie. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I can already tell you that the movie is more \\"based on\\" than really telling the same story.<br /><br />This is a stunning movie visually, and probably would be musically if my audio equipment was up to par. I was frustrated by not being able to understand the spoken word enough to be sure when they were talking and when singing. I think it is just because my headphones are pathetic, but it may be something more. Since this is almost an opera itself, it partakes of one of the problems I have always had with opera: I can seldom understand what they are saying, even when they sing in English. This is English, I can catch enough words to know that, but I had to do a lot of lip-reading and inferring from my knowledge of the story.<br /><br />Still, it is remarkable how much I was able to appreciate in spite of that problem. A lovely device at the outset of the movie and used periodically afterward is the way they switch back and forth between 1919 (I believe it is) and 188?, when the main part of the story took place. The part where the Opera House is in ruins and the old man in a wheelchair is remembering are in black and white, although some red gets in at times. Then as the auctioneer has the drop cloth pulled off the huge crystal chandelier, it begins to rise to its original position, throw off its gray dust and it becomes lit up again. As it rises, the whole theater gradually sweeps into color back in its former gilded age, and there we are in the past.<br /><br />The movie eliminated one fascinating character I had hoped to see, which is the Persian. Part of his role is absorbed into the dancers' mother, who is an employee of the Opera. Her daughter is a charming little blond and apparently Christine's closest friend. Christine (Emmy Rossum) is the very beautiful and under-appreciated soprano who takes over for the prima donna when she is sabotaged by the Phantom. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) is actually a human being, more or less, and has been giving Christine singing lessons invisibly by way of a pleasant little legend Christine's violinist father had told her about the Angel of Music. He pretends to be the Angel and trains Christine by hiding from her and therefore giving her the impression he is non-material and invisible. In fact, he's just horribly disfigured and wears a mask. The book and the movie disagree on how he became disfigured, so I won't meddle with that.<br /><br />The Phantom (named Erik in the book, but I don't recall that his name was ever used in the movie) lives in his own little world beneath the Opera house, in cellars and passageways that are partly involved in the functions of the theater, such as trap doors and heaters, and partly the result of the way the opera house was built on top of excavations that were used by the Commune as a prison during the revolution. He's fitted it all up with luxurious trappings, thousands of candles, his own miniature stage set on which he arranges operas with dolls, and a huge pipe organ.<br /><br />There is complexity to the Phantom's romancing of Christine in the form of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney, a childhood friend of Christine's who renews contact with her after her first great triumph. He's young, handsome, titled, charming in every way, and falls completely in love with Christine. Or perhaps rekindles an old love for her. In any case Erik, the Phantom, sees him as a rival for the soprano's affection, and he does not play fair.<br /><br />I'll leave it to the movie to show you just how unfairly he can play. But then read the book, and compare. In my opinion, the book depicts much more macabre and inventive punishments for Erik's rival.<br /><br />No, of course I won't tell you the outcome.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|Okay so I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who and David Tennant is my favorite actor. This sonic is the most iconic, it spanned over two doctors and 5 seasons.<br />Packaging: Pretty good. It was a strong plastic package and most importantly it was easy to open =]<br />Sound: The sound is nice. But I really wish I could take the sound chip from the 11th Doctors screwdriver toy and put it in this. The two sounds are very similar but they are loud and true to the show.<br />Toy: I would say is that it's a little on the light side. I feel like if I step on it or sit on it it will crack. The pen bits will probably be a problem as well seeing as they don't clip in. I will probably super glue one of them in after the other runs out of ink. Also I have the sneaking suspicion that the little knob covering the screw on the slider will fall of and be lost forever. But besides these things, its bloody fun. I am 18 and I literally spent a day running around my house pretending to sonic things. It is brilliant. I have never played with a toy this much.<br />Cons: The UV light is purple. I really wish it was blue, but I guess it was the price to pay in order to have an awesome secret message function. Also doesn't come with psychic paper.<br />Verdict: If you are a doctor who fan, buy this. If you aren't and just want a UV pen, you can probably find a better more sturdy one with more ink.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|Well, OK, some of it is a bit tacky, but I cannot deny it is funny. Very, very funny. The jokes are sometimes of the sort where you are a bit ashamed of yourself for laughing (as when John Balushi imitates an exploding zit), but I laughed anyway. Sometimes followed by \\"Oh, gross!\\" but I laughed.<br /><br />I just saw \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" a little while ago, and it's quite clear where they got some of their best plot lines. The basic outline is that in 1962, the Deltas are the disgrace of the snooty private college campus. And predictably, their house is right next to the snob appeal BMOC frat. But they are fun guys, they stick together, and they dispense with all that hazing and paddling of other frats and just baptize their new pledges with beer. In fact, beer is a major theme here. They also never clean or repair their house, thus anticipating the Zeta Psi house I remember being just down the block from our co-op in Ann Arbor in the early 1970s. They gave the best parties, too.<br /><br />The administration is of course determined to get rid of them, and I have to admit, they were generally justified. But they used such blatantly unfair tactics that you have to side with the Deltas as they decide to retaliate. And even if you don't, you will laugh yourself sick at what happens to the homecoming parade when they decide to enter a float (a cake inscribed \\"Eat Me\\") in the parade even though they have been forbidden to do so. These are imaginative fellows, even if they don't bother going to class much.<br /><br />I'm not going to give anything away here, just say that I understand now why this movie has been recommended to me for so many years.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Underworld: Awakening is not as good as the other 3 Underworld movies, but it is still worth watching. It is non-stop action and almost has the feel of a \\"resident evil esq\\" type movie. Having Kate Beckinsale back with the franchise is good, but not having the same \\"Michael\\" was a little off-putting. They did leave it hanging so there is probably another movie in the works.

B00005JM02|5.0|I suspect all the rest of you have already seen this, but when it first came out, it was hailed as a children's film, and I don't go to children's films in the theaters. In fact, I no longer go to theaters at all. But I knew someday I'd have a DVD player, and would start buying movies.  This one was worth the wait.<br /><br />Marlin and Pearl, two clown fish, have a clutch of eggs (Pearl estimates about 500), and they are almost ready to hatch when the story opens. But Pearl and most of the eggs are eaten by what I think was a barracuda. One egg survived, and the grieving Marlin put all his energy into raising his only son, Nemo. Nemo has one \\"bad fin,\\" which he and his father refer to as his lucky fin, which is clearly a great deal smaller than the other. But he can swim OK, and his overprotective father gets on his nerves.<br /><br />One day, angry at his father's fears for him, he decides he's going to go out to the \\"butt\\" (boat) anchored nearby and touch it. However, through a bizarre series of events, he ends up captured by the diver that comes upon him unexpectedly and taken back to his salt water aquarium in his dental office.<br /><br />The other fish in the tank help him learn the ways of the tank, but a serious danger threatens. They hear the dentist say that he plans to give the clown fish (i.e., Nemo) to his niece. They know her to be a thoughtless and selfish fish-killer. The last one her uncle gave her was killed by her shaking the plastic bag he was in too hard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the reef, Marlin is determined to follow the boat and find Nemo and somehow get him back. He has no idea how once he finds he cannot swim fast enough to keep up with the boat. He asks a blue fish whether she has seen a boat go by recently, and she says yes, it went that way.<br /><br />This blue fish is Dory, the absolutely lovable absent-minded kook played to perfection by Ellen DeGeneres. She actually reminds me of my former neighbor back in California, Lexi, who was every bit as lovable and almost as kooky.<br /><br />Needless to say, Dory and Marlin go off to look for Nemo, and have amazing adventures along the way. One of the best parts is a group of sea turtles that are riding the AEC (Australian Eastern Current) to Sydney, which is where Dory figured out Nemo had been taken. The diver had dropped his face mask, which had his name and address on it, and Dory can read. I'm not sure we ever find out why Dory can read, but I suppose she went to school. [very old joke, that]<br /><br />The interesting thing is that while the story is improbable from the start -- find one little fish in that great big ocean? -- there is always an explanation, however bizarre, for everything that happens. It goes without saying that Marlon and Nemo eventually find each other, but it would be downright cruel to spoil it by telling you how. As I say, perhaps improbable in the extreme, but if you buy the fact that fish can talk and understand human language, the rest is plausible.<br /><br />I loved this movie a great deal, and thank my friend Dory (different one, I think) warmly for encouraging me to get it.o was every bit as lovable and almost as kooky.<br /><br />Needless to say, Dory and Marlin go off to look for Nemo, and have amazing adventures along the way.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|This was a great addition to the Stargate World, but unfortunately Sci-Fi canceled it after only 2 seasons. (A very bad move in my books.) This series was just starting to find its feet and become even better when it was cut short. Luckily, the series ended with a Cliffhanger - leaving future possibility. Hopefully someone will pick it back up or at least do a follow-up movie like they did to close out SG-1. If you loved SG-1 and Atlantis you will love SGU too.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|This was my first experience with Michael Moore's reporting/humor. But it's not my last: in the same order, I also got \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" \\"Bowling for Columbine,\\" and \\"Roger & Me.\\" He makes some vitally important points in this film, and blew away most of the arguments against government-paid health care that I have heard (and, I will admit, perpetuated) over my years as a Libertarian.<br /><br />Most of America agrees that food, clothing and shelter are necessities, and that if someone cannot provide them for themselves, it is simply humane and civilized that we pay for them with taxes. For most of us, the same is true of health care. Sure, we know there are abuses, but it's better to help one or two or even ten who might be able to help themselves, but are simply unwilling. Our alternative is to let those who really cannot meet these basic needs for themselves suffer needlessly. But that puts a huge gap between the poor who are acknowledged to need help and the middle-class who are expected to help themselves. So if it is all paid out of taxes, rich and poor and everyone in between, you don't need a big bureaucratic structure to decide who is unworthy and who is not.<br /><br />The really tragic stories are those who have health insurance, and so believe they are covered, and then get denied coverage by their insurance company for something they really do need. We are not talking vanity plastic surgery here, folks; we are talking basic health care needs.<br /><br />So Michael Moore, in his very boy-next-door style, shows us people in America who have had terrible problems due to the HMOs and insurance companies who find it in their interest to refuse treatment. And he shows us how different the situation is in Canada, England, and France. And finally, in Cuba.<br /><br />In a bold move that I couldn't help admiring, he noted that the prisoners of war on Guantanamo Bay have free health care, and better than what most of us have. So he loaded up several fishing boats with three ailing 9/11 rescue workers who could not get adequate care in the US, and a lot of other people who were not getting adequate care here, and took them to Guantanamo. Not too surprisingly, they were not permitted to land. So they went to Havana. And the Cuban doctors (those evil Communists) asked for name and date of birth, and provided them with the diagnostic tests and treatments they needed. One woman had terrible respiratory problems as a result of being at Ground Zero for some time breathing in ashes and whatever else. She had an inhaler which cost her something like $120 in the US. This is a huge sum when she needs one or two a month and she only gets $1,000 a month from SSDI. In Cuba, the same inhaler cost the equivalent of about $.05 -- yes, five cents.

One woman had terrible respiratory problems as a result of being at Ground Zero for some time breathing in ashes and whatever else. She had an inhaler which cost her something like $120 in the US.

B00402FGE4|5.0|This was a great addition to the Stargate World, but unfortunately Sci-Fi canceled it after only 2 seasons. (A very bad move in my books.) This series was just starting to find its feet and become even better when it was cut short. Luckily, the series ended with a Cliffhanger - leaving future possibility. Hopefully someone will pick it back up or at least do a follow-up movie like they did to close out SG-1. If you loved SG-1 and Atlantis you will love SGU too.
B00005KAQP|4.0|Fun movie. OK, maybe corny in spots, maybe the plot is a little contrived, but it's fun. Whoopi Goldberg is clearly the reason, but she brings out the best in the other actresses (and the few actors) as well. Maggie Smith is even more starched as the mother superior than she is as Professor McGonagall.<br /><br />Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi) was a singer in Reno when her gangster boyfriend Vince (Harvey Keitel) committed a murder. She just happened to walk into his office as it happened, and witnessed it. She ran straight to the police, who agreed to hide her if she would testify against Vince. Fine, but where they decide to hide her is in a convent.<br /><br />The mother superior (Maggie Smith) insists she cannot hide there unless she wears a habit and assumes the role of a nun. She invents a cover story about being transferred from a different convent, and names her Sister Mary Clarence.<br /><br />Deloris, coming off the glamor of a stage career in Reno, is bored, feels confined and rebellious.<br /><br />For punishment when she misbehaves (not going to tell you the nature of her misbehavior; that's part of the fun I don't want to give away), Mother Superior assigns her to the choir. She has already witnessed just how bad the choir is, so it seems like punishment.<br /><br />But in no time at all, she is able to teach them how to sing. In doing so, she demonstrates that she knows a good bit more about music than she ever showed in her rather pathetic Reno act. The problem is, they are not content to sing conventional hymns. She gets them singing jazzed-up versions of love songs to God and to Jesus.<br /><br />But Vince's thugs are still looking for her. There is a spy for Vince in the police department who gets the exact address of the convent and gives it to Vince. The chase is on.<br /><br />It gets a little hard to believe, but it is great fun. And the music really is quite good.
0156012197|5.0|\\"The Little Prince\\" is a fantasy book that everyone should read, even if you're at age 100. It's plot, nature and atmosphere is far different from any fantasy we're used to, but once you start reading it, you will be amazed to see what happen in this story.<br />It starts off with an pilot's crash in the Sahara where he meets a little boy who is a prince, who is main focus of the story. The boy tells the pilot that he come the planet Asteroid 325 and how he cared for the planet and his bond for a rose he loved which was shattered by a lie. After that, the prince went to journey to six different planets and meets a few mysteriously odd people and learns about their strange behaviors and purposes in their lives. Then thoughout the journey, the little prince comes to Earth, but then still wonder about his rose he lieft behind.<br />This story let me wondering about many thoughts, about how one certain thing can keep you thinking. We don't get things like dragons, knights with swords, or even a fantasy, but what we get is something one of a kind. Readers will find it a heartfelt story, while others might find it confusing, but \\"The Little Prince\\" is definitely something out of this world.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This story literally made me cry! I mean it! Not from how adorable Wall-E is, nor his \\"girlfriend\\" Eva, but when we finally get to see what's become of the human race after some 700 years in space, waiting for the earth they trashed to become inhabitable once more . . . well, I cried.<br /><br />You see, one of the reasons Wall-E was left behind when they evacuated was to clean up the mess. The mega-corporation B&L (wait until you find out what that stands for) had basically turned the planet into a consumer world, and when it got totally full of garbage, they thoughtfully built one (or more) space ships to take the population into space while the B&L robots cleaned it up. Then they sent out probes like Eva to see if the planet had recovered.<br /><br />Apparently the work did not progress too well, because Wall-E was the only one left in what looked superficially like New York, until you get close enough to realize that most of what seemed to be skyscrapers were actually huge stacks of compacted trash that Wall-E had stacked up just for nowhere else to put them. Wall-E has carved out a niche for himself, collecting various artifacts for their curiosity value. For example, he has an old VCR on which he can play \\"Hello, Dolly.\\" A couple of songs from that soundtrack make up an important part of Wall-E's soundtrack. He watches humans singing and dancing and holding hands, but he really doesn't know what it's all about.<br /><br />Until Eva shows up, that is. Her design is some 700 years in advance of his, and she's pure white, basically egg-shaped, and terrifyingly powerful. Wall-E looks like a beat-up trash compacter beside her, because that's basically what he is. Still, they make friends, and when Wall-E gives Eva a spindly little plant he found growing in the trash and carefully potted in an old boot, she goes bonkers. Turns out that signs of photosynthesis was what she was sent to search for.<br /><br />The way Wall-E manages to hitchhike on the ship that picks her up, and what happens in the B&L floating pleasure palace when they arrive, is the best part of the story, and the part I don't want to ruin for you. Pixar designed the whole thing, and you know by now what geniuses they are. It's completely amazing how much personality they manage to pack into the robots which are most of the movie. So I'll just encourage you to enjoy it.er up, and what happens in the B&L floating pleasure palace when they arrive, is the best part of the story, and the part I don't want to ruin for you.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|Most of my friends will be amazed to learn that I have never seen this movie before. But in 1970, I was not into going to children's films, being much to old and sophisticated for that.<br /><br />I loved it. I loved each of the cats individually, and dear Madame, and even silly Georges, the lawyer. Of course I hated Edgar the evil butler and was amused by the two hound-dogs. But what I confess I loved the most was the Scat Cat's jazz band and that wonderful song, \\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.\\" We cat lovers know just how true that is, don't we?<br /><br />Duchess and her three lovable kittens, Marie, Berlois and Toulouse, live with dear Madame, a wealthy and lonely old lady. She calls her old friend and lawyer, Georges, to come and write up her will. But the sneaky butler Edgar is listening on the speaking tube and overhears that she plans to leave all her money to the cats, with Edgar to take care of them. Edgar will then get the residue of the estate when all the cats are gone. But he doesn't want to wait, so he decides to get rid of Duchess and the kittens. He dumps them out in the country, figuring he's well rid of them. But he had not counted on Thomas O'Malley the alley cat, who happens by and rescues them.<br /><br />The story is of course much more complex, incredibly funny, and as I say, includes the perfectly wonderful Alley Cat Jazz Band. And this being Disney, of course it all ends well for the cats and Madame -- and even for Georges.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Here's another one I've heard so very much about, but had not seen until today. I think my sides are sprained from laughing so hard! Tom Hanks is exactly the right voice for Woody, the cowboy who seems terribly out of date when Andy (their human) gets a Buzz Lightyear (voice by Tim Allen). Of course, as all kids know, the toys come to life and can move and talk when the humans are out of the room. We've known that at least since \\"A Little Princess\\", right?<br /><br />Anyway, the big hassle is Woody has been Andy's favorite for so long that it comes as quite a shock when Buzz shows up, and suddenly the pictures on the corkboard, the bedspread and all the energy of the room is about space, not about westerns. Buzz has become Andy's favorite. Woody feels heartbroken.<br /><br />But there's another problem: Andy and his family are moving, and there's a great deal of anxiety that one or more toys might be left behind. They all have moving buddies, who are supposed to look out for one another and assure that they are properly packed for the move.<br /><br />The boy next door, Sid, is a little monster. And he makes monsters out of his toys and also his sister's toys. He blows up the toy soldiers, replaces his sister's doll's head with a dinosaur head, and generally has no respect for toys. Due to a thoroughly crazy set of circumstances, Woody and Buzz fall into his evil clutches. How they work together to escape, and to follow the moving van carrying Andy's toys to their new home, is controlled mayhem so intricate and so funny that I won't spoil a thing for you. Lots of action for the kids, lots of inside jokes for the grown-ups, and everyone can split their sides laughing.
B00005J79J|5.0|Excellent CD, the titles were exactly what I would have expected from Sarah Brightman as a greatest hits album.

Great mix of opera, contemporary and just plain old good music that you can't lump into a catagory.
B00003CX9S|4.0|John Hurt played the title role, John Merrick, but I'm betting you will not recognize him under the absolutely amazing make-up job. John Merrick was a real person, although this is not a literal biography of his life, as far as I know. [Wikipedia says his real first name was Joseph, but that Dr. Treves got it wrong in his memoirs.] He lived in Victorian England, and he had the most extreme form of his disease (I went to Wikipedia and get the technical name; Neurofibromatosis) that Dr. Frederick Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) had ever seen. His head was huge and incredibly distorted, much of the rest of his body was too, although his left arm and his genitals were normal.<br /><br />Dr. Treves found him in a freak show, where he was being horribly abused, and brought him to the London hospital where Treves was a surgeon. He installed him in the \\"isolation ward\\" at the top of the hospital, and soon learned that Merrick was not the idiot he had assumed he was, even hoped he was, to avoid thinking of how miserable his life must have been. In fact, when he introduces Merrick to the head of the hospital (Sir John Gielgud, I believe), the head thinks he is simply mindlessly parroting what Dr. Treves had taught him. But when he recites the entire 23rd Psalm, while Treves had only taught him the first few lines, they both become aware that the man has a normal, perhaps even a superior, intelligence.<br /><br />His speech was at first terribly slurred by the shape of his mouth, but with practice, he learned to speak pretty well. Treves takes him home to meet Mrs. Treves, who is very kind to Merrick. Eventually Treves introduces Merrick to a great many other members of London polite society, including a famous actress played by Anne Bancroft.<br /><br />But the coarser elements of London are not done with The Elephant Man. One of the men who works in the boiler room of the hospital discovers where he lives, and starts charging people at the local pub to climb up to the roof and look through his window at him. One such gawking party gets completely out of hand. The boiler-man thinks it amusing to bring along a mirror, perhaps having noticed that there were no mirrors in Merrick's room, and speculating that he may not ever have seen himself. Apparently he was right, because Merrick screams and goes into shock when he sees himself in the mirror.<br /><br />Included in the number is the old drunken sadist who had exhibited him in a sideshow. He kidnaps Merrick and takes him to France to renew his sideshow career. But the other freaks help him to escape, and he returns to England.<br /><br />No, I haven't told you too much. There's a great deal more to the story, including especially a rather stark contrast between those who feel real compassion for Merrick and do what they can to make his life more comfortable and even pleasant, and those who just want to make money and bad jokes off him. Indeed, Dr. Treves is so sensitive that he worries he's no better than the sideshow man because he has introduced Merrick to society people. His wife reassures him that John his happier than he has ever been before, although I must say that's not the greatest compliment in the world.<br /><br />This is not a horror story. It's a story of courage and compassion. Indeed, it could rightly be called a love story on several levels.look through his window at him. One such gawking party gets completely out of hand.

B003Y5H5B0|3.0|\\"21 Jump Street\\" is a movie satire that's too self-consciously aware that's a badly put together movie satire, and therein lies its quaint charm.  The movie seems to be struggling against itself, against the mendacious machine that is Hollywood -- the recycling of bad television shows and bad concepts from a more innocent era when people watched stupidity with glee into a cynical era when people expect to watch stupidity, and it's this understanding that everything on the screen is stupid that fills people now with glee.  Well, \\"21 Jump Street\\" does deliver.
B00003CXA2|5.0|OK, I know what you're thinking: what's the matter with me that I didn't see this long ago? Well, in 1994, when it was in the theaters, I would not have gone to it without Steve, and he wasn't interested. And we never owned a DVD player. So I've really only had about three years or so to have come across it. Nobody who told me about it told me enough to appreciate that I probably would like it, including that Tom Hanks (the guy from \\"DaVinci Code,\\" but I didn't know the name then) was someone I would love as a terrific actor. Anymore than I would have believed I'd love Leonardo DiCaprio in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" until I saw him in \\"Titanic.\\" In fact, he was so convincing in Grape that I thought it really was played by a retarded guy, just like the mother really was played by a morbidly obese woman. I mean, no actor can fake it that well, can they?<br /><br />Apparently some can.<br /><br />Forrest is not seriously retarded, after all, he's just \\"a little slow,\\" as his mother (Sally Fields) puts it. She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible. Very determined, as the principal of the school finds out. The other thing is he wears braces on his legs. Why? The quack his mother took him to acknowledges there's nothing wrong with his legs, but his back is \\"as crooked as a question mark.\\" So why do braces on his legs have anything to do with curing his back? We never do find out. But one day when Forrest was being chased by bullies on bicycles, and is running as fast as he can, the braces just break and fall off, and he's running like the wind.<br /><br />Forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were \\"like peas and carrots\\" after that. Always together. He figures she's his girl, but she doesn't quite see it that way. In fact, as they go through life, they keep finding and losing each other.<br /><br />I won't go into all the details, but the basic premise of the story is that Forrest is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, and gets talking to whomever sits next to him, whether they answer or not. Most of the story is thus told in flashbacks while he tells his experiences in a simple, straightforward way. He's met three presidents, the first one Kennedy as he was on an all-star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there; I'll let him tell it), and the third was Nixon, because of his central role in the \\"ping pong diplomacy\\" with the Chinese.<br /><br />In fact, he seems to always be involved in something which we remember from the news, one way or another. Not for anything he figures is all that special, but just for doing his job or for sheer coincidence. For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel. I don't remember what Forrest answered, but Nixon says he'll be more comfortable in this nice new hotel that only recently opened. That night he's in the Watergate and calls the front desk to report that \\"they must have had a power out over there because there are people walking around with flashlights and everything.\\" Next thing you know, Nixon is resigning.<br /><br />He makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways. Still, coincidence is never strained too far, because Forrest has gotten famous, so people who want to can find him.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right. You won't pity Forrest, but you will learn to see the world through his eyes to an extent you would not have thought possible when the movie began. It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture.

B006OFN0BQ|3.0|The actors in this belabored and ponderous film do an excellent job, and DiCaprio captures perfectly the rhythms and cadences of J. Edgar Hoover's speech and body movement.  The story is convoluted and confusing, and it's unclear what this bio-pic is trying to say about Hoover.  It's hard not to respect his dedication and singular focus which made his FBI into a national institution, and it's hard not to feel sorry for this man couldn't love (because of a strong-willed mother who refused to accept his sexual orientation) and thus couldn't be loved.  What this movie glibly ignores is that Hoover was a singularly evil and power-obsessed individual, who would stop at nothing to achieve absolute power and who in doing so created cult of power.  This shows Clint Eastwood's ultimate weakness as a director -- his lack of moral imagination.  There is a surprise turn late in the movie that's supposed to reveal Hoover's self-grandiosity, but it's a very weak and unconvincing turn that demonstrates how weak and unconvincing this movie really is.
B00008CMR6|2.0|John Wayne westerns do tend to take on a lot of similarity. I don't have a good enough memory to specify which picture(s) each of these cliches came from, but there are quite a lot.<br /><br />1. Yankee and Confederates who end up fighting together after the war. (Just saw that one very recently in \\"The Undefeated.\\")<br /><br />2. Pretty girl who takes up with the young and handsome guy that Wayne is partnered with, and treats Wayne as a fatherly figure. (This is a later development, but it is in almost every one of his later films. Earlier they took up with Wayne himself.)<br /><br />3. Old geezer who's too stubborn to sell out to or give in to the land-grabber who uses dirty tricks of various sorts to take over a whole town.<br /><br />4. Corrupt sheriff who is in the pocket of said land-grabber.<br /><br />5. Shoot-out in which Wayne's side is outnumbered considerably, but win because they are better shots and because they are clever and do something unexpected to foil the villains.<br /><br />6. Holing up in the sheriff's office and/or jail, wherein at least one person, and probably several, call out \\"You! In the jail!\\" to get their attention so they can parley.<br /><br />This one had a few original elements, but that could almost be number seven on the list, because none of the stories are really without original elements. This one starts off with a very daring and original train robbery. In fact, it's so clever, I wonder if it is historical, taken from a real robbery at some point during the civil war.

630542828X|4.0|John Travolta plays a personal injury attorney who is sucked into a suit against a tannery that polluted a river in a small town, where children died of leukemia, people got sick, and at least one child was born with a birth defect for which there was no other explanation. Unfortunately, he was a partner in quite a small firm -- only four lawyers -- and the costs to prove up the case piled up to million dollar level and beyond. Also, the entire firm was working on this one case, so no income was being generated.<br /><br />How did this all work out? Well, you'll have to see the movie. But I will say this: We are not going to see one of those lawyers' fantasy cases where the jury returns a verdict with punitive damages sufficient to really punish the wrong-doers. Not one of those cases. This is a true story.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|What a marvelous movie! If Australia really is as fascinating as this movie suggests, I really do want to visit. Not Darwin, though, I think. I understand the temperatures there in the summer are pretty outrageous. And I'm not sure I could celebrate the first big storm of the rainy season by running around in the downpour laughing and dancing.<br /><br />Still this is a great story. As far as I'm concerned, the real star of it is the little kid who is the narrator as well as central character. His name is Nullah, and as he explains right at the start, he's not a black fella, he's not a white fella, he doesn't belong anywhere.<br /><br />Well, that turns out not to be entirely true. But the government was certainly trying to enforce that concept. They set up \\"mission schools\\" where the half-caste children were basically taught to act white, and probably to aspire to jobs as servants. Nullah does not want to go. He's happy living on the cattle station where his mother works, in spite of being afraid of the manager who is probably his father and also apparently the murderer of the owner, Lord Ashley. Lady Ashley (Nicole Kidman) arrived from London just in time to find her husband laid out for burial. The murder was assumed to be the work of King George, Nullah's grandfather and a powerful native wizard. Indeed, he has taught Nullah much magic.<br /><br />One of the things that interests me about Australian movies and books is that they almost always act as if the aborigines' magic is real. Well, perhaps it is.<br /><br />This is a long movie, 2 3/4 hours long, but you'll never get bored. There are so many threads to the story that it weaves a complicated tapestry before you know what hit you. You can't help loving the main characters, Nulla, Lady Ashley, and Drover. And there are real villains to hiss, as well. Some of them work for the landowner right next to (and virtually surrounding) Lady Ashley's station, and the boss is determined to buy her out for a fraction of what the place is worth. He's trying to get a monopoly on supplying beef for the Army, and a ship is waiting in Darwin's port for the cattle he wants to sell for way too much money. So Lady Ashley, Drover, Nulla, and a minimum small band of assistance drive the cattle to Darwin despite all the odds. They face remarkable perils and have remarkable help, including some of that aborigine magic.<br /><br />The other significant thread is, quite obviously, the growing romance between Lady Ashley and Drover. All I have to say about that is I totally understand why Lady A found Drover (Hugh Jackman) appealing, and I suppose the gentlemen readers will understand why he found Nicole Kidman desirable. They make a very sweet couple when they get the chance.<br /><br />But don't forget the government's attempts to kidnap Nullah and try to make a good little Christian peasant out of him. That turns out to have bigger ramifications than it appeared early in the story, even though his mother died to protect him from the \\"coppers.\\"<br /><br />Yes, see it.

This is the most disturbing movie I have seen in many a year, at least if we leave out the documentaries. Yes, it's fiction, in that it's exaggerated for dramatic effect. And yes, a great deal of what's in it is true. I hope major chunks of it are not as true as they seem in the movie. Because it all has a cause-and-effect sort of logic; a mad logic, if you will.<br /><br />Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is a network news anchor who is losing control of himself. Right on the air. In fact, after he's been given notice, he goes on the air and declares that he's going to commit suicide, right there at his desk, on network TV, the following Tuesday. The network security drags him off stage, but his ratings go up. Way up. From there on, the movie is barely controlled chaos.<br /><br />Faye Dunaway plays a hard-as-nails female who is not above using her sexuality to get what she wants; William Holden is the fly in her trap. Her ideas are beyond radical (The Mao Tse Tung Hour???), but the ratings are all that matters. Still, the UBC Network has recently been bought up by a conglomerate and much of the political and financial machinations are beyond me. Everyone is willing to sacrifice everyone else for the sake of a promotion. And the head honcho (not clear on his title or on exactly what he is head of, but I think it's the conglomerate) knows how to manipulate the paranoia and delusions of granduer of Howard Beale to promote the message he wants promoted.<br /><br />And the rest of the big shots who control Beale's life -- including the black widow spider played by Dunaway -- decide how to get rid of him once his ratings start to drop.<br /><br />It's a very chilling story, amusing and also horrifying, especially when you realize that it was made in 1976, and how much of it was like predictions that came true.that came true.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Great album.  Album lives up to the bands name, have had this playing for a couple of weeks now, not getting old yet.  Highly recommend along with Some Nights.
B000W746GK|5.0|I suppose I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed this film. I saw it in the theater when it was new, and I've played the DVD several times since I bought it over five years ago. But I had indeed forgotten some of the nuances which I enjoyed so much. So rather than spend much time on the basic plot, which you probably already know for the most part, let me tell you of some of the things that struck me as especially fine.<br /><br />I love the special effects that created Dobby. It is through him that we know what a house elf is, even though when we meet Kreature later on, and Winky too, they are rather different. But Dobby is a fully developed character, not just a special effect. He has personality, moves like a living being, and turns out to have a good bit of magic of his own. Aside from the regulars we met in the first movie, I think Dobby may be my favorite.<br /><br />I am also impressed by Tom Riddle. We'll see him again later, too, when Dumbledore shows Harry some of his memories. But this 16-year-old Riddle is charming in a horrible way, and very impressive in a way similar to Anakin Skywalker. We not only see him as a villain, but get an opportunity to glimpse how he got that way.<br /><br />Richard Harris plays Dumbledore again, and is truly lovable in his way. Not that I have anything against the guy who replace him, but he remains my visual and auditory image of Dumbledore.<br /><br />Then there is the fool of the piece, Gilderoy Lockhart. If that isn't every ego-mad idiot you've ever known all rolled into one, what is? Of course, underneath his fake reputation is a coward. Seems like that's often the case.<br /><br />It may be just my imagination, but I don't think this one suffered as much in the transformation from book to movie. The basic elements are there, and we get visual images to attach to them when we go back to reading the books. Lucius Malfoy makes a terrific villain, doesn't he? And my favorite Dumbledore quote is there, reworded only a little: \\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\" Important for all of us to remember.ttle: \\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\" Important for all of us to remember.
B000063KG6|5.0|What a CD this is. I first got into Ten Years After after watching an old video of the concert at the Isle of Wight that took place in 1970. That was a couple of years ago and I was absolutely blown out with their performance of \\"I cant keep from crying somtimes\\" what a guitarist and what a fantastic blues/jazz/rock band. I have since bought just about everything they have put out. Alvin Lee is an underated legend and he and the bands ability to change their sound from album to album is mind blowing. Stonedhedge is just a classic example of their ability to do this as it is a journey all the way through. I just am so grateful that I have experienced all of this 40 years later as if I hadnt watched that Isle of Wight concert I would of missed them and these guys are the underated legends.
6305433909|3.0|This is a different movie in many respects, with the only common thread being Doloris Van Cartier aka Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) and a couple of the other nuns, including Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Before, Doloris was disguised as a nun involuntarily to keep her identity and location secret in a witness protection program. This time Mother Superior sends her old friends to fetch her from a headliner show in Las Vegas. She returns voluntarily to the habit in order to help save St. Francis Academy in San Francisco, where she went to school so disastrously as a child.<br /><br />Also, this time she's not teaching nuns, she's teaching adolescents. That makes it a totally different story right there. What could be a simple remake of \\"Going My Way\\" or \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" is redeemed by the kids themselves. There's some very competent acting, and some truly excellent singing and dancing among these kids. The interaction with Sister Mary Clarence is great fun and very involving.<br /><br />The story about a misanthropic school official (James Coburn) and a skeptical principal is just the frosting on the cake. Yes, the story is repleat with cliches, like the state-wide competition which will somehow save the school from being closed. But if you simply allow the story to be the trivia it really is, you can have a lot of fun, and find yourself rooting for the talented kids against all odds, even their well-intentioned but emotionally hardened mothers. We had to have one that had a mother who refused her permission. We had to have at least one person in the school who is openly against the school choir be converted at the last minute by how very talented they are, and they had to win the competition against impressive odds, largely due to a major pep-talk by Whoopi.<br /><br />So what if it's a corny movie? It's a fun one.
B0000636NQ|5.0|I have been to many concerts over my long history of listening to bands with includes a lot of pubs. How I would have given anything to be at this \\"live\\" pub recording in the late 60's. I regard this CD to be the entry level of getting to be a \\"Ten Years After\\" fan. This is great and anything you buy after that from this band will never let you down. Alvin Lee is a freak as how could anyone be that good and fortunately enough for him he has the right backing band including his talented brother Ric on drums. I just cant beleive I missed this band in the late 60's and 70,s.
B000SINT52|4.0|Very possibly Michael Moore's best film. It is quite provocative but uses enough real footage and undeniable facts that you can't help feeling he has some very important points to make here.<br /><br />The movie opens on what George W. Bush was doing when he heard about the attacks on the World Trade Center. When the first plane hit, he was en route to a school where he had a photo op planned with some first grade children. So he goes right ahead and continues to the school. So he's sitting there reading some idiot story with the children (on film, after all, because it was indeed a photo op) when an aid comes and whispers in his ear about the second plane hitting he second tower. For 7 minutes or more, he continues to sit there with the children, very possibly in shock (hard to tell on that face), and does nothing. Of course, the teacher and the children have no idea what his aid just whispered in his ear, and they go blithely on with the story book.<br /><br />One point which cannot be missed in this movie is the extent to which GWB, President of the United States, is essentially clueless. We've known it for some time, of course; but this will rub your nose in it. The movie was made before Obama was elected, so take that into account in judging its effectiveness.<br /><br />Moore does not go so far as to say that Bush planned or even ordered the attacks on the Twin Towers, as some people have argued. But he does point out that the Bush clan (father and son) have many strong ties with oil men in the middle east, especially the Royal Saudis, and very specifically the Bin Laden family. I won't try to unpack the complex interrelationships of families and family money, oil money and oil reserves, financial and political power. Moore does it so well.<br /><br />The other thing he does so well is to go where the people are, ask them what's going on, and listening to what they have to say. He visits corporate money men who are getting rich off the war, or off the fear generated by 9/11/01. He visits whatever politicians and law enforcement people are willing to talk to him, and some that are not. But he also visits Iraq and the soldiers and civilians there. And, because he always needs to pander to the young people's love of blood and gore, shows some very graphic pictures of bloody corpses and other nasty details about the war.<br /><br />He makes friends with a family from his home town of Flint that lost a son in Iraq, and the soldier's mother later comes to Washington, D.C., and visits the White House. Moore brings along a disillusioned Marine to confront congressmen with the fact that there is exactly one son or daughter of a congressman with the military in Iraq. He offers them recruitment pamphlets go give to their children. Most are unwilling to accept them.<br /><br />Be sure you have a fresh box of tissues handy when you play this DVD; like all the others Moore has made, this one will grab at your heart.erated by 9/11/01.

0790729350|3.0|WARNING: The lyrics which are scrolled across the bottom of the screen are not honest. Some of them substantially change the meaning of the songs. Some things about sex, drugs and politics are the main victims, so I am not able to believe it was just poor work on the part of the person who wrote them. This is intentional distortion of the truth!<br /><br />This movie is a documentary, to the extent that it includes a good bit of footage beyond the music. But mostly what it's good for is to see a piece of history, cultural history, and some truly great bands. Here's the list from the liner notes of the film:<br />Crosby, Stills & Nash: Long Time Gone<br />Canned Heat: Going Up the Country<br />Crosby, Stills & Nash: Wooden Ships (with terribly distorted lyrics)<br />Richie Havens: Handsome Johnny<br />Richie Havens: Freedom<br />Canned Heat: A Change is Gonna Come<br />Joan Baez: Joe Hill<br />Joan Baez: Swing Low Sweet Chariot<br />The Who: We're Not Gonna Take It<br />The Who: Summertime Blues<br />Sha-Na-Na: At the Hop<br />Joe Cocker: With a Little Help From My Friends<br />Country Joe & the Fish: Rock and Soul Music<br />Arlo Guthrie: Coming into Los Angeles<br />Crosby, Stills & Nash: Suite Judy Blue Eyes<br />Ten Years After: I'm Going Home<br />Jefferson Airplane: Won't You Try<br />Jefferson Airplane: Uncle Sam's Blues<br />John Sebastian: Younger Generation<br />Country Joe & the Fish: I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin-to-Die Rag (including the famous Fish Cheer)<br />Santana: Soul Sacrifice<br />Sly and the Family Stone: I Want to Take You Higher<br />Janis Joplin: Work Me, Lord<br />Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Chile<br />Jimi Hendrix: The Star-Spangled Banner<br />Jimi Hendrix: Purple Haze<br />Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young: Woodstock<br />Crosby, Stills & Nash: Cost of Freedom<br /><br />It's worth it for the music alone, but the story of what it was like for half a million people, mostly young, to spend three days together in a muddy field is pretty interesting, too. Enjoy: they sure did!: they sure did!

B000RF7XYO|4.0|Like all court dramas, it's not always easy to tell who is doing what to whom. I suppose that's the nature of royal courts, at least back when they held real power.<br /><br />Elizabeth held real power, and therefore was threatened on all sides. Cate Blanchett plays a very convincing Elizabeth, from the time when she was a princess in seclusion in the country and her crazy sister Mary sent for her to try to persuade her to keep England Catholic, and lock her in the Tower of London on general paranoia. She was clearly in love with Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), at least until she was told he was already married.<br /><br />Advisers wanted her to marry the king of either Spain or France, arguing that her throne would not be safe until she had married and produced an heir. Oddly enough, they only mentioned Catholic kings. But Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) advises her to take care, and not get involved with either France or Spain. France was allied with Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots, was trying to claim England for Catholicism. Spain had some plots of its own.<br /><br />Then word gets to the Queen that the Duke of Norfolk is plotting an alliance with Mary to raise a claim to the English throne, and Elizabeth realizes she has no choice but to deal harshly and summarily with the Catholic plotters. She then talks it over with Walsingham and realizes she must be the Virgin Queen for England, to replace their devotion to the Virgin Mary with devotion to herself.<br /><br />That's the rough outline of the story, but the story is in the details, some gruesome, some passionate, and all filled with spectacular costumes and sets. It's a lavish production about royalty, and you won't miss the fact that it's long ago when things were rather more brutal than they are today.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett will make you believe in Elizabeth as a force for civilization.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I wasn't sure how to play at the beginning. You basically just keep tapping on coins and apples. You continue to buy animals and decorations for your village. As the levels progress, you get coins more often. I don't like that many things require acorns yet you can only earn a few acorns a day. There is only 1 mini-game (30 seconds to play) so I wish it had more. Be careful if you buy babies to complete animal families. At first, I thought you just buy them and they get added to your village but some animals take 6-12 hours to hatch. The game is in real-time so if you buy a baby at 8pm, it might be ready at 4am. The babies run away after some time and you have to pay more to find it so if that happens while you are sleeping, you'll pay more. I think that is absurd!
B004SEUJ82|4.0|I'm very conflicted about this movie. For one thing, it's hard to see Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) playing an SS officer. Sure, he's cute little Bruno's father, and that voice is clearly the same one with which Lupin addressed Harry Potter. But he develops a rather hard edge as a necessary part of his job as Commander of a death camp. And his very handsome young driver (Henry Kingsmill, whom I KNOW I have seen somewhere before, but don't know where) also gets a pretty sharp edge, in part to compensate for an \\"unpatriotic\\" father who went to Switzerland at the time of the rise of the Nazis.<br /><br />Bruno and his family lived in a perfectly marvelous old house in Berlin, where his family was obviously important. His parents tried to make \\"moving to the country\\" sound great when they went to put Father in charge of the \\"work camp,\\" which Bruno at first took to be a farm. It's strange, though, because all the farmers wear striped pajamas. The house is starkly modern, and I suspect brand new. But it's large and they have several servants, so what's the kid's problem? He's bored. He's even more bored when he finds that he and his older sister are to have a tutor instead of going out to school.<br /><br />Bruno is terribly bored because he's not allowed to go beyond the front courtyard of their home, which is surrounded by a steel fence. Guarded by soldiers, presumably because his father is so important. He's not even supposed to be in the back yard, but he's a natural explorer, and so he explores, and discovers a window in a storage shed that gives him access to the wooded area behind the house. This in turn leads him to a tall fence strung with barbed wire, where near the fence sits a boy just his age who is named Shmuel. He'd never heard of anyone named Shmuel before, but then Shmuel had never heard of anyone named Bruno before, so they are even on that. Both being lonely, they make friends.<br /><br />We who know what the camp was all about are aware that this friendship can be dangerous for both boys, but we're into the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film before we find out just how dangerous. Of course I'm not going to give it away. I'm just going to give it four stars.iendship can be dangerous for both boys, but we're into the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film before we find out just how dangerous.

B000B8QG22|4.0|Everybody knows I love Robin Williams. But I have avoided this movie for a long time, since I have such mixed emotions and memories of the Vietnam War era. Still, the premise of this movie finally got to me: a disc jockey on the service radio station with all the ad-lib skill and insane humor of Robin Williams. After all, those guys needed things to laugh about, you betcha.<br /><br />Adrian Cronhauer (Williams) arrives to find the station is a decidedly mixed bag. Some are total sourpusses, some are just no-talent (the guy who thinks he should play polkas and tells the most stupid jokes you have ever heard), and some are cool but essentially powerless. That is, if you go by the rules. Cronhauer is not really into rules. He knows he's in a war zone, although he is told Saigon itself is pretty safe. And he accepts the twin censors (yes, literally twins) who cut out most of the news before he can broadcast it. But he plays rock and roll, he jives with the audience, makes up incredible \\"interviews\\" with people he imitates (including Nixon, among others), and becomes extremely popular with the soldiers. Not so the officers, except the one commander who understands that morale is a major issue with the troops, and is the one who discovered Cronauer on Greek radio and brought him to Vietnam.<br /><br />He's starstruck over a beautiful girl who passes by on the street, tracks her to an English class being taught by a soldier, and bribes the teacher to let him teach for awhile. But the girl is there with her brother, who is very protective. Keep your eye on that brother.<br /><br />Without giving away any plot lines, one thing I can recommend is you pay close attention in that English class, where Cronauer is really Robin Williams, teaching the class how to talk street-wise American English. Very, very funny stuff.<br /><br />There's both humor and tragedy, and some very thoughtful aspects to both, as in most Robin Williams films. Why not five stars? Because the military parts are pretty one-dimensional, the good guys really good, the bad guys really awful. The good guys smart; the bad guys stupid. And I figure you've seen one Vietnam war movie, you don't need more of bombs and bloody corpses. Still, I will grant they are relevant to the story, and not too over-done. Or at least the bombing of the bar where the Americans hang out is relevant to the story.rts are pretty one-dimensional, the good guys really good, the bad guys really awful.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I understand this is a movie that started with a TV series called \\"Firefly,\\" and therefore it's probably not surprising that I didn't understand everything that went on. I saw some things that reminded me of Star Wars, some of Star Trek, and some of . . . well, other science fiction stories more generally. The girl River made me think of Lord of the Rings. But that's OK; it's all put together in a rather unique combination.<br /><br />At one level, this is a swashbuckling heroes adventure story. At another, it's a war story. Lots of technology for the nerds. And some rather spacey spiritual stuff, too. There's even a touch of romance. Just when I thought I understood (sort of) what was going on, something completely unexpected threw me off again. The fact is, it's got me hoping for a sequel.<br /><br />The basic story, as I understand it, is that in the far future, there came to be a major division among inhabited planets between those on the outer edges and those toward the center of \\"civilization\\" who formed an empire-like central government that behaves as if it is benevolent, and may even believe itself to be. But River saw the flaw even as a child in the opening scene. They meddle. They're not into freedom, they're into peace. In fact, the entire story seems to be about the tension between those two goals. River is the subject of some strange mind-control experiment that is really very spooky, but not well defined at first. Her older brother, a medical doctor, risks much to get her free from the authorities, but then she and her brother are hunted. It's clear she has been made into some sort of a weapon, but in exactly what way takes a while to be revealed.<br /><br />Anyway, her brother takes her back to the ship Serenity, where he has been ship's doctor while the ship is engaged in a variety of mercenary missions, some of them even legal. (Millenium Falcon, anyone?) Captain Mal is not happy with having a fugitive on board against his will, but reluctantly takes her along because there doesn't seem to be a lot of options. And she does have some useful talents, as he soon discovers.<br /><br />The crew is actually fighting two enemies: the Empire (OK, I may be going a little too much into the Star Wars analogy, but I don't recall what the authoritarians were called) and some rather horribly cannibalistic sub-humans called Reavers (think Tuscan Raiders). They don't just eat people, they prefer to eat them while they are still alive. Brace yourself: toward the end of the story we find out how the Reavers got that way. Not pleasant, not at all.<br /><br />There's also a Haven planet, run by a gentle sort called the Shepherd, and there's a mysterious planet that the authorities have gone to great lengths to keep secret. Yes, there are lots and lots of threads to this plot. I may watch it again someday.<br /><br />Four stars. I'd give it five if I understood better what was going on. There's a lot of action way too fast for me to follow, and sometimes people say things I simply do not get.

B00000IQV7|5.0|Yes, another story told by the lovable Robin Williams. We learn almost as much about Williams as Dr. Hunter Adams in this story. Because Robin Williams really does have the gift of laughter and compassion, and ability to bring out the human element in even the most irascible people.<br /><br />Hunter Adams got the nickname Patch when he was in a mental hospital, self admitted because he had made a failed suicide attempt. There he discovered, as many people do, that the best cure for ones own troubles is to help someone else. Indeed, I think it's probably the most successful prescription for depression ever devised. There was another patient in the hospital who had been a brilliant physicist, and who could still be seen filling notebooks with arcane formulas. Adams sat and watched him work, and noticed that his notes were being damaged by a leak in his paper coffee cup. So Adams put a piece of tape on it, apparently from some sort of medical wrist-band. He patched the professor's coffee cup, and the professor gave him the nickname Patch.<br /><br />When he realized that he could heal himself with laughter, and help his fellow patients into the bargain, he signed himself out against medical advice and went to medical school. But of course he could not, simply could not, do things the conventional way.<br /><br />He was not even supposed to be in the hospital, because medical students were not supposed to be in contact with patients until their third year. But he snuck in and found himself in a pediatric oncology ward. Cancer patients, bald-headed kids. On an impulse, he took a rubber bulb normally used to irrigate the ears and suchlike, cut off the pointed end, and stuck it on his nose. It looked exactly like a clown nose. He clowned around and made the kids laugh, which of course got him in trouble.<br /><br />I won't spoil it, but there is one other element that needs to be mentioned. A lovely female student caught his attention, but she avoided him. The story of how and why he won her over is touching, and had me personally crying. I suppose I really mean the why of her avoidance of men.<br /><br />See the movie. It really is wonderful. A lot of small details about it are wonderful, and the overall feel of it is equally wonderful.w and why he won her over is touching, and had me personally crying.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician and economist who did amazing original work. My own diagnosis of him during the early part of the movie was Asperger's Syndrome, but eventually the diagnosis of schizophrenia is fully justified. Until we get pretty far into the story, the audience doesn't know any more than Dr. Nash does about what is real and what is hallucination. So having given that tiny clue, amuse yourself by trying to guess. Chances are you will be at least partly wrong.<br /><br />But as the movie also makes clear, a brilliant mind is not proof against mental illness, and indeed may be at least part of the cause. It might be interesting to look up some statistics on that, but not right now. Right now the important thing is one woman (Jennifer Connolly) loved him, and stood by him when his illness caused them both a great deal of trouble. She earned the right to be dressed to the nines and sit in an auditorium in Stockholm, applauding and glowing with pride as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics. It was for the work he had done long ago, which turned out to have practical implications beyond what even he had considered.<br /><br />It's a very real, very compassionate look at what can go wrong in even a beautiful mind. Maybe even, as I said, more often in a beautiful mind than an ordinary one. Five stars, although at least one of them is for my sense of kinship with Dr. Nash.

B002D0L0R2|3.0|OK, OK, it's a pretty silly movie overall. But it is also a lot of fun. I'll go for fun, even when silly. Well, maybe even partly because of the silly.<br /><br />You want to hear silly? Guess who plays Tracy Turnblad's mother? John Travolta! I kid you not! I thought when I first saw her that she was in drag, but it was not until I saw the closing credits that I was sure. Yep, John Travolta as a middle-aged fat lady whose husband (Christopher Walken) is very much in love with her.<br /><br />Tracy is played by Nikki Blonsky, and is a bouncy butterball. It's not realistic, because if she was really as bouncy as that, running and dancing and all, she wouldn't be so fat. But anyway, if you once accept the premise for her and her mother, the rest of the movie is great fun.<br /><br />Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) are crazy about the Corny Collins Show, a local TV show in Baltimore that plays in the late afternoon, but is not really a take-off on American Bandstand. There are dancers, including Link Larkin with the curl down his forehead (Zac Efron), and blonde bitch Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), whose mother is the station manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) and quite the bitch herself. Amber is quite proprietary about Link, but he doesn't seem impressed with her, and in fact ends up falling in love with Tracy.<br /><br />I told you it was pretty unrealistic, didn't I? Perhaps having been a fat girl who loved handsome boys when I was young, I find the story pretty hard to believe.<br /><br />Anyway, Tracy is added to the show's dance troupe in the strangest way, but that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Tracy is sent to detention at school, and finds that it is full of Negroes. Yep, Negroes, not blacks. That came later. And she makes friends, singing and dancing friends, of course. It turns out the Corny Collins show has Negro Day once a month, with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) as the hostess. They are so segregated that a dance which has both Negroes and whites has a white rope down the middle of the dance floor, and no one is supposed to cross the line.<br /><br />Tracy does. But when Negro Day is cancelled, Tracy and her new-found friends decide to march in protest, and insist that the show be integrated.<br /><br />There's a great deal more, including plenty of silly sight jokes (Tracy's dad runs a joke shop), dancing and singing through the streets, and all the teen-age cliches you might expect from a movie set in 1962 in Baltimore. The costumes and sets alone are worth the two hours of your time. Heck, seeing Travolta in such effective drag would be worth that all by itself!oth Negroes and whites has a white rope down the middle of the dance floor, and no one is supposed to cross the line.<br /><br />Tracy does.

0783233477|4.0|Joe Black (Brad Pitt) is Death. Yeah, really. He has come for Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), but makes a deal to give Parrish time in exchange for having a \\"vacation\\" in a human body with Parrish as his tour guide. Problem is, the body he chose for the purpose was one that had just made a big impression on Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). Of course, Joe Black did not know anything about the body's activities before he took it: he just needed a body.<br /><br />Joe goes everywhere with Parrish, which causes no end of trouble. For one thing, never having had a body before, he didn't know basic things like peanut butter, or how to behave in a corporate boardroom. Because Parrish is very, very rich. He's the founder and Chairman of the Board of Parrish Communications, which is being faced with a takeover by a Rupert Murdoch sort of character. There are even a couple of spies on his board. One is a stupid dupe who doesn't understand the takeover aspect. The other is a stab-in-the-back glad hand who is the real mastermind of the swindle.<br /><br />Meanwhile Susan Parrish, a doctor resident in internal medicine, is falling in love with Joe Black, figuring he is the same guy she liked so much in the coffee shop that morning. There's a touching scene with a Jamaican grannie who begs him to take her away. She recognized him at once. He spoke Jamaican/Rasta dialect with her. She says she's in such pain, and he can help her.<br /><br />Joe turns out to be very clever at covering his identity when he's about to be found out.  He declares himself an IRS agent!  It's really very funny, but the purpose is quite a serious one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There are loads of reviews discussing the poor writing and repetitive adjectives. Those reviewers are correct, the books are chock full of flaws.  Having said that, I read fiction to be entertained.  If I find the characters unbelievable yet interesting then I have been entertained.  If I can't put a book down or I blow through an entire trilogy in 4 days then I have been entertained.  That was all I expected and that's what I got.  If you are looking for high literature, this book isn't for you.  If you want to read a fun book and escape the grind for a little while Fifty Shades will deliver.
B000AY74OG|3.0|This is a thoroughly insane movie. A lot of fun, a lot of in-jokes, but completely insane. (People who know me understand that I mean that as a compliment.)<br /><br />A lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe are all friends who live in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The zebra dreams of living in the wild, which somehow he gets mixed up with Connecticut. So he breaks out and finds his way to Grand Central Station to try to get a train to Connecticut. His friends have to go and find him and bring him back before he gets in serious trouble.<br /><br />Of course, this lands them all in serious trouble. They are to be shipped to Kenya. They are in crates on board a ship, stacked on the deck. But their crates fall overboard and they find themselves washed up on an island which turns out to be Madagascar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a troupe of penguins who were equally dissatisfied with the Central Park Zoo have hijacked the ship and . . . well, I did tell you it was insane, didn't I? Now do you believe me? It's a lot of fun, and the grownups will laugh their heads off at the subtle jokes while the kids have a great time on the broad and obvious ones. Just don't look for anything more profound than friends have to stick together. That and for a carnivore who hasn't had anything to eat for awhile, even his friends will start looking like thick, juicy steaks.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|Darn shame the system only has five stars maximum. I want to give this movie more. Maybe ten. Maybe it's because I'm a baby boomer and aging hippie, but this touched me very, very deeply. I'm sure I've annoyed my room-mate wearing the earphones and singing along with the songs.<br /><br />Lucy, an American girl, and Jude, a British lad from Liverpool, are the couple at the center of the story. But Sadie's there, and Prudence, and a most artful weaving of Beatles songs into a relatively coherent story. And anything done during that period has to be a little incoherent anyway in order to be authentic.<br /><br />I'm going to be a brat and not tell you hardly anything of the story. But I will say that you will recognize how well the songs fit, and how well other elements from the same era fit, including one character that will remind you of Janis Joplin, and another that will remind you of Jimi Hendrix. There are some artful touches, like the choreographed ballet with the soldiers and the nearly naked inductees at the draft board. The cops that break up an anti-war demonstration are singing.<br /><br />This is a unique concept in story-telling, and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Anyone who hasn't seen it is highly recommended to do so at the earliest opportunity. And if you are over 40, you will probably not be able to resist singing along.
B0058YPLA2|4.0|Spoilers ahoy!<br /><br />Oh where to begin... I've watched this show from beginning to end, and I have to say I like it. It's unlike anything else on television right now. If you liked [[ASIN:B0000648XE The 10th Kingdom]], [[ASIN:1890096482 Shards Of The Glass Slipper: Queen Cinder]], SyFy's [[ASIN:B0031DDG9A Alice (TV Miniseries)]], [[ASIN:B004SIP794 Ella Enchanted]], [[ASIN:B005LAII0S Mirror Mirror]], or any of the light to medium weight fairy tales retold, then Once Upon a Time is right up your alley. It's kind of a relief to watch after all these gritty, sometimes depressing and disturbingly violent shows like [[ASIN:B003Y5HWMW Game of Thrones]], [[ASIN:B004HW7JMY Spartacus: Gods of the Arena]] and [[ASIN:B003Y5HWK4 Boardwalk Empire[Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />The format of the show may be difficult to follow, because the fairy tales are told out of sequence, as the parts told in our world happen in order. However, you could probably watch the episodes randomly and still understand what's going on. The premise is that Snow White's stepmother, The Evil Queen, has cursed all of Fairy Tale Land and transported them here, to a Maine town called Storybrooke. (Yes, seriously.) No one remembers who they are except for a select few, and time is at a standstill until The Chosen One arrives. Confusion may come when trying to remember all of the characters' names and/or titles. Regina/the mayor/the evil queen, is one example, but the stories are told in a way that eventually you know who's who.<br /><br />The show is written by some of the people from Lost, and apparently there are a lot of references to Lost on screen. I never watched Lost, so I can't comment on that. There are also many references to Disney both visually and in the plot, so that's kind of fun to see. Some people say this is family entertainment, but I have to disagree. I would be very uncomfortable explaining some of the plot points to young children. To be fair, the original Grimm tales are pretty grim as well, but this show uses Disney characters as a base. While Disney films have also had many questionable moments, I would not recommend this for the whole family.<br /><br />For one thing, Prince Charming/David/shepherd guy is married to King Midas' daughter/Princess Abigail/Katherine in this world. (Are you following all this?) He is cheating on her with Mary Margaret/Snow White/Princess Snow. Presented in context, it's understandable and even sympathetic, but they carry it too far. The pregnancy test drama simply piled onto the fact that David/Charming is a big dumb schmuck. In the finale, I was rooting for the dragon to win and for David to leave town.<br /><br />The worst thing about the show to me is the way adoption is portrayed. The themes seem to be adoptive parents' and children's worst nightmares. Emma is left at an orphanage as a baby and never gets a real family, bouncing around from foster home to foster home. Henry is Regina/mayor/evil queen's adopted son in, and from, this world. He keeps saying his mother is evil, and runs to his birth mother, Emma for help. Henry never shows any attachment to his adoptive mother, and Regina shows little true maternal instinct until the finale. Even then, it's too little too late. This is another thing the writers take too far when Emma threatens to take Henry away from Regina. The genre just isn't right for some of this stuff.<br /><br />Some religious groups will have a huge problem with nomenclature if they don't already shun the show because of magic. Emma is referred to as \\"the savior\\" throughout the series, and even begins to refer to herself this way in the finale. These are just a few of the awkward things about OUAT that would make me think twice about letting my kids watch. Your mileage will probably vary. You may not care, you may have mature kids who can handle the content-- I'm just telling you what's in there.<br /><br />Caveats aside, it's intriguing to watch character fairy tale back stories unfold, always in a way that relates to what is happening here and now. It's hard to understand how some of the events in our world could happen, unless you've heard director commentary on a 5-episode DVD that was available around Easter. They explain that time has kind of \\"stopped\\" in Storybrooke, which is why you see things that seem to be anachronisms and events that wouldn't seem likely these days. I don't think it's as obvious as they seem to think, at least not to me. As with all stories about time travel and manipulating time, I tend to go a bit cross-eyed. If time has stopped in Storybrooke, how did Henry age 10 years with no one noticing that no one else did? Maybe it's just magic, but sometimes it's hard to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />The plot is predictable at times, but is otherwise engaging. Regina and Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltkin are worth watching. It's not about police procedurals, doctors or lawyers. This show is very close to what I've been looking for-- something taken down a notch from all these shows that are too clever for their own good, something with characters, story and without the squick. It's something different and in my stomping grounds. I just wish the writers would stomp David/Charming into somebody that I could like. He's too dumb to win or live. In a game of thrones, he'd already be dead.ways in a way that relates to what is happening here and now.

B000053VAZ|5.0|Benny (Aidan Quinn) is Joon's (Mary Stuart Masterson) big brother. He's gotten in the habit of looking out for her, and can't seem to break it. Even when he is clearly in the way of her developing romance with the lovable but quirky Sam (Johnny Depp), who becomes their housekeeper and eventually, Joon's lover.<br /><br />I really do not know how anyone could see this movie and not be charmed. For one thing, there are no villains. I like movies that can manage to sustain a story without having to do \\"bad guys\\" as a major portion of the story. Sam does a superb Buster Keaton imitation. Joon is enchanted; so is Benny. He starts thinking Sam should make a career out of his comedy. His friend is a booking agent, and is willing to have a look at Sam' routine. The bookings, if successful, would take him on tour around the country.<br /><br />But Joon doesn't want him to leave, and apparently Sam doesn't want to go. They decide they have to tell Benny they are in love. He freaks out, but this issue is resolved in a unique way. They find that love matters, whoever you are. And eventually, so does Benny.
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins is the kind of writer that makes flying fun for me. Time stands still when I have a James Rollins book with me, this one though I read on my Kindle.<br />This one is a book that is like riding the most complex roller coaster. The pace never slackens, the story never flags and the Sigma Force keeps you glued to the book. All the complex science explanations, the tech wizardry, the drive of men, and the implausible plot keeps you on tenterhooks.<br />I had difficulty in really pressing end on my devise and read the end as it was so engrossing, It took some doing to not do so.

B000W74EQC|5.0|I didn't review the Potter movies when I first got them, because they were at the height of their popularity, and I figured everyone already knew as much as they wanted to about them.<br /><br />Having seen the later ones, it's refreshing to go back and see our favorites, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) looking so young and innocent. And downright cute! They are supposed to be 11 years old, and I think they were about that, but they seem so incredibly young.<br /><br />This is also one that has Richard Harris as Dumbledore. I loved him as Dumbledore. Did he do just one movie or two? [Two.]<br /><br />Anyway, the story is very well known by now. Harry was one year old when the evil wizard Voldemort (\\"He Who Must Not Be Named\\") killed his parents but failed to kill him, leaving him with a lightening-shaped scar on his forehead instead. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the only person You-Know-Who ever feared, decides to place the orphaned Harry with his aunt and her husband, the \\"worst kind of muggles,\\" the Dursleys.<br /><br />Sure enough, they are indeed pretty impossible people. Their piggish son Dudley is spoiled completely rotten, Uncle Vernon is an ass and heartless toward Harry, and Aunt Petunia has always thought of her witch sister, Harry's mother Lily, as a freak. They never told Harry about his parents, but instead claimed they had been killed in a car accident.<br /><br />But on Harry's 11th birthday, he receives mail addressed to him from Hogwarts which Uncle Vernon destroys before he can read it. Finally, Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts, shows up to take Harry to get ready for his first year, and off they go to London, to Diagon Alley. From there, Harry rides the Hogwarts Express, where he meets Ron and Hermione.<br /><br />The plot is complex and detailed, despite it having been simplified considerably from what the book includes. Much of the charm is the setting of Hogwarts itself, an ancient castle with wonderful magical properties, including all sorts of charming special effects.<br /><br />Without going into too much detail, Harry is chosen as the youngest seeker on the Quidditch team (a sport played on broomsticks that slightly resembles basketball, hockey, and several other team sports that chase balls), and of course is brilliant in it. But the movie only includes one game, although there are several in the book. Just as well, I say; I'm not a sports fan.<br /><br />The sorcerer's stone in the title is what traditional alchemy calls the philosopher's stone. It has many magical powers, including the ability to formulate an elixir of life that grants immortality. The story of the stone, how it is guarded at Hogwarts, who is trying to steal it, and what Harry, Ron and Hermione have to do to foil the plot, is the basis of the story I won't spoil for those who have not yet seen it. Since it's perfectly obvious, I don't suppose there's any harm in saying they succeed.<br /><br />There are terrific special effects in this movie, my favorite being a bigger than life wizard chess set. Wizard chess is played just like Muggle chess, except that the pieces are enchanted and smash each other instead of merely capturing. Fortunately, Ron is good at chess, or all would have been lost. He plays a knight, Harry a bishop, and Hermione a rook/castle. When Harry successfully checkmates, the king throws down his sword.<br /><br />I've seen the movie about as often as I've read the book, which is quite a few times each. I used to chafe at the number of elements that were in the book but left out of the movie, or shortened to the point of being barely mentioned. But I have long since accepted that these are two different media, and have different needs. The books are excellent books, and the movies are excellent movies. They don't need to match.<br /><br />I give the whole series five stars.es.

B000W796OM|5.0|This is the third story, and my favorite of all the movies at least. Not sure about the books, but this one is the one that was best translated to the screen of any of the series. Maybe it's Buckbeak, the hypogriffe, or maybe Sirius Black, or maybe that marvelous time turner and the rerun of one three-hour segment in the lives of Harry and Hermione. Perhaps it's Professor R. J. Lupin, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And we can't discount Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher who is even loopier than most of the staff at Hogwarts. Actually, there is so much to love in this film that it is one you really must watch several times to catch it all.<br /><br />First, the Dursleys get a visit from Aunt Marge, Vernon's bossy sister who raises dogs. She is so completely obnoxious to Harry that he loses his temper and blows her up. Not like a bomb; like a helium balloon. But as Cornelius Fudge points out, she was brought down over Surry and her memory was adjusted, so no harm done. But Harry thought he would be arrested and at the very least expelled from Hogwarts, so he takes a ride on the Knight Bus (hilarious trip commented upon by a shrunken head that hangs over the dashboard) and goes to the Leaky Cauldron. Fudge is waiting for him, and he soon finds Ron and Hermione, along with the entire Weasley clan, are already in residence at the Cauldron. Against advice not to \\"worry him,\\" Mr. Weasley tells Harry that escaped murderer Sirius Black is apparently searching for Harry to kill him.<br /><br />And then the story gets really complicated. But watch everything, even the things that seem to be irrelevant distractions, because it all gets woven together very skillfully by the end of the story. I simply don't dare to tell you too much, because the surprises are the best parts. Let's just say that one of the most important magical objects in the story is a map. So from the time the Weasley twins give it to Harry, keep your eye on that map. Even when the credits come up at the end, keep your eye on that map.credits come up at the end, keep your eye on that map.
B006MW3VGA|1.0|As incredible and surprising as Season One turned out to be, Season Two was just as incredible and surprising - only in the other direction. We gave up on it after Episode 3. We have a biblical theme with men coming back from the dead, unrequited love on steroids, and interwoven plot themes that border on the bizarre. The writers must have been on strike. Thoroughly disappointing.

Grudgingly, a tip-of-the-hat to the number of politically correct twenty-first century issues addressed in 9th century Norway - not an easy task.<br />  1. Woman defies man and makes her own way (a tough act to do during the iron-age).<br />  2. Woman punches man and knocks him out. (yawn)<br />  3.

0439023513|1.0|Sadly, I didn't find Mockingjay to be a successful novel. I won't provide any sort of synopsis, since everyone's done that already, but I will list a few of the complaints I had. First, the plot's too episodic. The action just doesn't all feel organic, the logical result of previous events. Some of their actions (i.e. Katniss voting for the hunger games) just doesn't make that much sense. A lot of things lack sense in the book. Second, the author doesn't let the reader experience several of the events of the book because Katness is knocked out during them. Other major events are just written so obliquely. They happen, but you're not told who they're happening to, and so you don't know how to react. Then, the author will reveal who they're happening to. I guess she's going for confusion and shock as the salient response she's seeking to provoke. I would rather, though, have a deep experience of the book, feeling the action happen as it is occurring. A lot of the feelings that might have made this a more emotionally rich novel felt like they were frustrated.<br /><br />Lastly, Katniss just felt so bitter and hopeless throughout the novel, even at the end. I get that war would change you and that you can become bittern and cynical as a result. But the thing that works about Katniss early in the trilogy--and about young adult literature as a whole--is that she doesn't give way to cynicism. Despite all of the hardships, despite being sucked into the games, she's not corrupted. That's book one, and a little of book two, though. Katniss in this novel is almost fully corrupted. She spends the whole novel being untrusting, angry, unsympathetic, cynical, and uncompassionate. The book doesn't find her redeemed, at least not convincingly.

However,  this book has managed to make deviant sex seem thrilling and mainstreem!Its so sickening how the book is making a person who should have a psychiatric diagnosis sexy and appealing!

His sister Debra in that series has a mouth like a sailor in that series. Love her character, miss it.  Reading this book, I could picture Debra as Anastasia.  She would be just as awkward and and have the same potty mouth.  Enjoyed the build and how Christine deflowered Ana in the end.  Being deflowered by a sexy billionaire aint bad.  I can see how people would compare this to twilight.  If this book were Greys Anatamy, Christine would be Doctor McDreamy,with handcuffs and a flog,lol.  Love the title as well.

0452284392|5.0|This book is about the peculiar results obtained when the author set out to \\"map the internet\\".  Just as we have maps of cities and towns it would be useful to know how to get from here to there via electronic means.  One of the premises is that most people don't know that someone somewhere has produced information and published it to the internet unless your part of that \\"community\\".  The author goes into detail about how new information is constantly being produced but that we can't find it unless it is connected thru \\"hubs\\" that many of us connect to in various ways (google, amazon, etc.).  These hubs provide links to other hubs that in turn lead us to other hubs.  Its all about dissemination of information.  Why do some videos go viral and others never even get started?  They make reference to the game \\"6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" to illustate how all of us are loosely connected in very short distances via particular routes.  For example we all know someone that everyone knows for some reason or another.  I wonder aloud how this field will boom into a science and how retailers will exploit it.  I remember a line from a book about the Manhatten Project that says something to the effect that \\"technology itself in not inherently good or bad, its the implementation of technology that causes the distinction.\\"  You can't tell me that sharing all that information on Facebook doesn't have some negative consequences.

She really can think for herself, and is a less-whine-more-do kind of person. She's not all strength and spunk - she hides some vulnerabilities, too, and the way she deals with it all and the way Meyer wrote Cinder makes Cinder someone you find genuinely interesting. Prince Kai, too, is a great character, and so far from that cliche princely character we see so much of in books. He really is himself. He neither does everything too rashly, nor lets other people walk all over him.<br /><br />The two have great chemistry, too. It's a light sub-plot, though, and doesn't take center stage - the kind of romance I enjoy reading. Their interactions really helped build up on that chemistry, and much like the characters, the relationship between them seems genuine and likeable - one that I rooted for from the start.<br /><br />I loved how the author chose a different setting for her futuristic novel rather than the common one - America. But I found myself reading Cinder more for the characters than anything. Because, while Cinder and Prince Kai both had well defined, well-rounded, the world around them wasn't as much so. The story seemed to depend on the characters to carry it forward, and the world around them - New Beijing - wasn't as set to stone. What makes New Beijing different from anyplace else in the world that we know right now? There wasn't anything that really personalized and defined the place. It might as well be colorless and empty for all I knew. Needless to say, the world-building aspects of Cinder suffered a bit, lacking in necessary descriptions and details.<br /><br />The foreshadowing in Cinder was also not as strong. I could guess what really happened almost from the first time it was mentioned - it was pretty obvious. Like a neon yellow sign. Meyer all but gave it away. And so, though I've seen others on squeal and lament over that `surprising' cliffhanger, I found it to be extremely predictable.<br /><br />Even so, this book is an enjoyable, fast-paced read. With a light romance, and likable cyborgs and princes, Cinder is a nice, easy read. Definitely one to check out.us. Like a neon yellow sign. Meyer all but gave it away.

B004J4XGN6|5.0|It is so very difficult to find books on business startups that do not paint a wonderful beautiful picture. Being self-employed, I have read quite a few books on starting and running a business. Many books suffer from lots of inspiration but no road map and no practical steps to take. After reading these books, you figure that you are the only small fry out there, that your business should be taking off by leaps and bounds just as those related in the wonderful stories.<br /><br />\\"The Lean Startup\\" is light years ahead and in it's own category. Here is a book that punches you straight in the face and tells you like it is. No sugar coating. No wondrous stories of success. This book, rather, presents a methodology to increase your chances of success. Note that I did not say \\"guarantee\\" but \\"increase\\". The author is honest enough to say that and I respect that a whole lot.<br /><br />The central idea I went away with after reading the book was the notion of Customer Development. It was a Eureka moment. I have begun using the techniques in the book in a new start up business that I am working on. And so far, I have saved myself some real $$ and heartache that would have happened if I used my old method of thinking about starting a business.<br /><br />Eric Ries ... thank you!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|Although the color (pink) was vibrant as I anticipated, I was really disapointed with the quality of this product.  The whole thing felt \\"thin\\" and flimsy.  Further, when you bend the backing into the wedge position, the divit it fits into is too shallow causing the whole thing to collapse way to easily.  In retrospect I really wish I had sprung the extra money for the leather version.
0439023521|5.0|In a world where all 12 districts are ruled by the controlling and ever-oppressive government known as the Capitol, children are forced to fight to the death until one person remains in the annual Hunger Games for the amusement of the Capitol's citizens. Katniss Everdeen becomes the next female tribute from District 12 for the 74th annual Hunger Games when she volunteers to take the place of her younger sister, Prim. Afterward, she and her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, are whisked off to the Capitol, where they are primped and prepped for the televised appearances that precede the Game itself. All too soon, the two teens are thrust into the arena determined to make it back home to District 12 and the families that they left behind - all while the entire world watches their every move. The Hunger Games is a book that immediately grabs your interest and doesn't let go until the very last page. Readers will laugh, cry, and fight along with Katniss and Peeta as they attempt to show the Capitol that they are people, not merely pawns to be used in their Games for the sole entertainment of the privileged of Panem.<br /><br />I started reading this book because of a good friend's persistent recommendation and I'd already been hearing about it because of the movie that comes out later this week. Regardless, I picked it up and I don't regret doing so for one second. I absolutely loved this book. From the plot to the characters, everything about The Hunger Games is incredibly brilliant. With this book, Suzanne Collins has managed to create a world filled with people and events that readers can easily relate to, fall in love with, and follow along throughout the entire story. That's what I loved about this book - the characters are so real that you feel like you are actually living out the story of The Hunger Games with them. I was hooked from the first few pages and literally could not put this book down - I even finished it in one day! If you like action, suspense, and an incredible storyline, then you should definitely pick up The Hunger Games. I promise you won't be sorry that you did. The Hunger Games will leave you wanting more - which is a good thing, since it's the first book in a trilogy.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I owned this movie on vhs and decided to order it on dvd to watch more often. The loveable Forrest is hard to resist. This movie enables the viewer to get involved with his life struggles and joys. The scenes between him and Lt. Dan are incredible! My family can quote entire scenes from this movie. Love it each and every time I see it. One of the true classics that will live on and on.
0439023513|4.0|The third and final installment of The Hunger Games trilogy picks up immediately where its predecessor, Catching Fire, ends. Katniss has managed to make it through the Hunger Games for a second time by once again outwitting the Capitol and its Gamemakers. And they're not any happier about it than they were the first time around. But before they get the chance to punish her, Katniss is scooped up by members of the resistance movement in Panem. She soon finds out that those behind the resistance are the citizens of District 13 - the district that the Capitol claimed to have destroyed 75 years earlier. More secrets are revealed and soon Katniss becomes the face of the rebellion against the Capitol. Can she become the leader that the districts so desperately need to break the Capitol's hold on them? Mockingjay keeps your interest from beginning to end, just as both of the other books in the trilogy.<br /><br />As with the other two books, I completely devoured Mockingjay and was genuinely sad to see it end. The ending was something that I didn't really see coming (I won't spoil it for you guys), but that was also something that I really enjoyed about the book. Suzanne Collins has a way of keeping her readers guessing about what will happen next, especially in this series of books. And that sense of surprise is something that I find refreshing, since I seldom see it in a lot of the books that I read. When reading these books, I also developed a sort of friendship with the characters. So, when I came to the end of the book, I felt like I was saying goodbye to some good friends. However, I still definitely recommend Mockingjay to any and everyone. It's an amazing read and tied the series together really well. If you've already read the first two books, then you absolutely must pick up Mockingjay - and if you haven't read The Hunger Games trilogy at all, then you are definitely missing out

0439023491|4.0|Katniss survived the games and is back in district 12.  But it's not what it used to be.  Her family has been moved to a new home.  Gale is now old enough to work in the mines to take care of his family and doesn't have as much time for hunting with Katniss and since Katniss confessed that her \\"love\\" for Peeta was all an act for the games to help them survive he hasn't been around.  There is also rumor of rebellion that has brought capital troops to the districts.  President Snow is angry and he wants revenge, which means that Katniss and Peeta are going back into the games.  Catching Fire is the action packed sequel to The Hunger Games.<br /><br />What I didn't care for about the book is that they were going back into the games.  After all of that working and fighting and surviving it was frustrating for me, as a reader, to watch them go back.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts about the book was that we got to go see the different districts when Katniss and Peeta went on the tour as champions.  It made them seem more real and give an insight into the other tributes, such as Rue's, lives.  When Katniss and Peeta went to the other districts you also saw how completely divided the country actually was.  When you read about it, you really see why they have never really been able to rise up against the capitol for so long.<br />My other favorite part, in one word, or should I say name, Finnick.  In Catching Fire and Mockingjay Finnick completely takes over my heart as my favorite non-main character.  When they first introduce him I wasn't sure about this guy.  But as you get further into the plot you find that he is a deep and loving man that will do anything in his power to protect the women he loves, who isn't quite right, from those who could hurt her, even cooperate and go back in the games.  Forget Team Peeta or Team Gale.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Since there are already several excellent reviews - and might I add one impressively detailed one - about John Carter, let me just say this. Ignore the critics and see this movie!! I'm assuming it's no longer in theaters, so then rent or buy the Blue-ray and watch it in high definition! :D This may not reach the \\"epic\\" stature that movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars/Empire enjoy but let me tell you - it's definitely a gem! The alien characters in John Carter make the ones in Phantom Menace look even more ridiculous than they already were (sorry George) and I can't say enough about the visual feast we're treated to. Actually, I think I've said enough, ha, I really did mean to keep this short and sweet. So, in closing... SEE THIS MOVIE!! If you don't absolutely love it, maybe you should reconsider labeling yourself a sci-fi fan... I'm just saying...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'd been hearing a lot of buzz about this series with virtually everyone who read it having great things to say. Finally, I decided I needed to see the reason for all the fuss. It didn't take long for Wool to sink its hooks in me. At the end of the short first volume (just called Wool), I wanted more. Although the story comes to a reasonable conclusion, I wanted to find out what happened to the characters next and learn more about the world they lived in. When I finished and evaluated why Wool appealed so much to me, I had a list of four main things: world building, characters, the appeal of dystopian fiction, and some cautionary tales or potential lessons.<br /><br />The story takes place in the distant future in an underground \\"silo\\" that is almost 200 levels deep. Howey does a great job of quickly establishing the basics of his story world, its culture, and history. Our knowledge of the world expands as the series progresses (learning more about the world and wanting to know more is part of the appeal). We learn about this world through normal, realistic dialogue (both spoken and internal), actions of characters, and narrative that is interspersed at appropriate times. The danger many authors fail to avoid in describing a world as complex as this is to dump too much information too fast and in ways that feel forced. That was never a problem for me with Wool.<br /><br />Howey's characters are nuanced, neither totally good, nor completely bad. For example, Juliette, who first appears in volume II and figures prominently from that point on, is one of the \\"good guys,\\" yet she has some negative qualities. Another major character, Bernard, appears bad, almost evil at times, yet as you understand his motivations and history more clearly, our judgment of him gets murkier.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, a dystopia \\"is the idea of a society in a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian.\\" Dystopian fiction appeals to readers with classics like 1984 or more recent hits such as The Handmaid's Tale, Mockingjay, or the Divergent Trilogy being prime examples. Although I'm sure there are many reasons, one obvious reason for their appeal is that they typically depict the human spirit as strong enough to deal with these less than ideal futures. The more it feels like the world is headed in this direction, the more we may have the need to convince ourselves that we could still survive.<br /><br />Besides the obvious lesson to take away from any dystopian fiction, that it would be better to prevent the world from reaching this point, I think Wool has other lessons, or at least food for thought, about how it is possible to become indoctrinated, and why questioning widely held beliefs might be healthy.<br /><br />**Originally written for \\"Books and Pals\\" book blog.

0439023521|5.0|I saw the movie first and was very impressed. The book was better as usual, but they did a great job staying with the story and the cast. Anyway this is a unique story of survival, showing humanity at its worst when people are suffering through a harsh dictatorship by the capital. Starving, Katniss is forced to break the rules by hunting for her mother and young sister. She makes the ultimate sacrifice by volunteering in her young sisters place to participate in the hunger games, where 24 adolescents fight to the death. This is a great read, you would not regret this purchase.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A book you won't put down easily. Although it is science fiction, I think it has a wide appeal because of the human aspect of the story. The writing style is easy to read and the characters are believable and appealing.

B000007VLL|5.0|Own several of her albums but was missing the 'so excited' track. This one had it so now I have all of Bonnie Tyler's songs I really like.
B002HFP0QU|3.0|I like to keep my original CDs at home, and to burn copies for the car.  So I popped disc 1 in to rip the CD, and none of the song titles were programmed onto the CD. Instead of song titles, Media Player just showed rectangles.  More confusing, however, was disc 2.  That CD did have song titles, but they looked like text messages (Run 2 Me), and there was at least one spelling issue... and then when I started to actually play the CD, I discovered that not ONE title was correct.  The titles were out of order, and listed some songs that actually appeared on disc 1. The box does list the songs in the order they appear on the cds.<br /><br />I haven't played the discs through, so I won't try to review the music.  But in playing snippets of the songs (to figure out what was actually on the CDs in the first place!), it was quite obvious that some of these songs aren't the versions I remember listening to off my old albums. I didn't realize I was purchasing remastered music until I looked at reviews (frankly, to determine if this was legit Bee Gees music.)  Some reviewers like the remasters, some don't; I don't have an opinion yet. Just be aware before you buy that these aren't the original releases.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a great wrap up to the trilogy. Although, I don't think this book can stand alone. If you are planning to read Mockingjay, I suggest you read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, the first two book of the trilogy, first.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I tried, and unfortunately I fell int that group of people that could not follow ALL of the different view points and changes and what is the point of this story, really - I followed book one just fine, but once into book two, it was like starting over and I felt let down that I invested time into a book and found by that point a new book - and a totally different angle on EVERYTHING - yeah, so I quit - so sue me - i just can not deal with a book that has more person point-of-views than there are days in the week - sorry - too much jumping around - next time, it should be separate novels in the same world, not multiple novels within one binding.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much. The journey you take with the main character Katnis is enough to keep you wanting more more. In addition, there's the philosophical comparison of where our society may be headed, if you choose to see it that way. I loved the entire trilogy, the first two books being my favorites. I was on the edge throughout the book, constantly wanting to know what would happen next.

B005LAIHIQ|2.0|I just got home from watching Dark Shadows. It was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The word is out on this stinker of a movie. There was maybe 7 other people in the theater with us. This is on the Monday after being released on Friday. All of the funny parts are in the trailers you can see for free on TV. The movie just kept dragging on-it seemed to never end. My companion almost fell asleep a few times and he is a huge Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan. I didn't laugh because I had already seen all the funny parts in the movie trailers for Dark Shadows. There were very few chuckles coming from the other people in the theater. What a shame. I really was needing a good movie and was disappointed beyond belief. Take my advice, if you want to see this movie, wait to rent it.

0385535139|3.0|I was hooked on Grisham books the moment I picked up The Firm.  I have read (and reread) most of his novels.  This one left me hungry, though.  Too bad, because I salivate every time I learn of a Grisham release.<br /><br />I found the plot here a bit incredulous.<br /><br />(1) A $300,000/ year attorney swaps his cushy income for the unknown.  When he has a meltdown and walks out on his job, he finds a neighborhood bar where he proceeds to drink himself into a frenzy.  He ends up on the doorstep of two shady street lawyers and decides to join them.  Wha???  Wouldn't it have made more sense for him to have either set out his own shingle or join a midsize, slower paced firm?<br /><br />(2) we were eased into thinking something would happen that involved the elderly lady he meets at the bar.  But no...she's just an \\"insert.\\"<br /><br />(3) I live in Chicago.  I can tell you with a fair amount of certainty that no bar owner would EVER allow an unknown patron to dine and drink that much without paying the tab before he left...trusting that David would return the next day to pay it off.<br /><br />(4) the big gun litigators are all over the seemingly harmful effects of the drug Kryoxx, certain they'd rake in millions in fees.  But no one...not one of them...does the proper research to fully determine the drug's ghastly side effects.  Again... Wha???<br /><br />(5) David has never set foot in a court room before this trial and he bungles his representation mercilessly.  His confidence (or lack of) is glaringly transparent.  But suddenly he has a moment of clarity where he rapid-fires questions and stats so eloquently that he causes the witness to cower in shame.  No build-up.  One minute he's a bumbling idiot in the courtroom and seconds later he performs like he's done this for years.  Nope.  Didn't buy it.<br /><br />There is a subplot of an unfortunate Burmese family.  Grisham brought them to life as credible, believable characters.  THAT should have been the primary storyline here.  JG missed the boat here.<br /><br />Will I continue to read JG books?  Yes, but with the fervent hope that he reads these reviews and takes his fans' comments to heart.  You're better than this, Grisham!

I find it a bit messed up she doesn't bother to just make a whole new album with the 3 song tracks and call it something else. If you don't have the original Teenage Dream CD then this online album is for you.  I personally felt its a waste of money and just downloaded the 3 tracks I needed. Either way, great tracks and I'm grateful that you can just choose the tracks you want to buy instead of the whole thing!  Long live online downloading!!!!  ;)

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Mockingjay was just OK!<br /><br />The last too books I found riveting, this one, I was dying to complete it.  It was boring, repetitive and instead of the writer building Katniss' character, I found that she was reduced to being annoying, weak and boring.<br /><br />I thought Katniss would have turned out to be a heroine but she didn't come close to it. She was practically in the hospital for more than half of the book - her character in Mockingjay is always confused and whining; to the point of being pathetic.<br /><br />If, you really look at the whole picture, Katniss has always been the one to be saved by other people.  Saved by Peeta, Rue and Thresh in the first book.  Saved by Finnick, Joahanna and Plutarch in the second book.  The list of people saving her continues.  Very disappointment with how her character regressed.<br /><br />I was really trying to like this book but at the end of it I realize there's nothing to like about Mockingjay.
