B005COO1X6|4.0|Not his best but still a good quick read. Nobody creates characters as well as King. Worth the small price.
B004SEUIWY|1.0|the movie came scratched unable to watch it. I was very displeased with this copy . I have purchased movies before they all worked well . I would like another copy .  other than that I receive the movies in a timely manner. And great prices.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a well written story and convincingly believable. The setting is perfect for such an unusual plot line and the characters are right out of every day life.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|Great movie! You can even watch it without the subtitles, very nice story and great acting.  It was very uplifting.
0375842209|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and I was instantly intrigued. All I knew about the plot was that a girl steals books. This really struck a chord in me since I absolutely love books. So I ordered the book and when it arrived I dove in. Little did I know the emotional journey I was about to take part in because of this book. It is a beautiful and heart-warming story depicting what war looks like through the eyes of a child.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is taken to live with a foster family in Molching, Germany during World War II. On the way her brother dies and she is first tantalized with the thrill of stealing a book, The Gravedigger's Handbook. Then she arrives in Molching and is forced to face the realities of real life. These realities are interspersed with the same thrill of stealing more books and allowing the words to change her perspective on life and the world around her.<br /><br />The best part about the book is that the story is written from the perspective of death; a very interesting twist that I was not initially expecting, but one that I came to really appreciate. Death has the ability to be objective in its analysis of mankind. The parting words say it all, \\"I am haunted by humans.\\" This book truly shows the power that can come from words. As well as how the human spirit endures, even after so much tragedy and destruction. It is a must-read for everyone!
0375413405|5.0|This is the third or fourth edition I have purchased of Julia Child's &#34;Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1,&#34; simply because my older copies had become too decrepit to use. Please note that this is a great price for this book!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Tony Bourdain tells all in this intriguing, funny, eye opening book. Non fiction that reads and moves like well written fiction. You literally can't put it down. A great insight into a world we all know exists but very rarely ever get a glimpse into.

B0045HCJKS|5.0|A Sci-Fi staple .. this is the beginning of the Terminator and various other cyborg based films... Michael Crichton set the bar and everyone else has moved it forward.<br />Good quality image and sound  on the dvd. A tad dated in references but hey back in the 70's we all thought the world would be cool and high heel boots, wide lapels and drooping mustaches were the future...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|These books are amazing I can't wait till the next book  I love this book. Read this book .yes yes
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It's hard to add much others haven't already said, but this is one of the consistently best written and acted shows around; only The Wire approaches it for quality.
B002ZG999U|5.0|If you love Stallone & all these really great co-stars....like Jet Li & Jason Statham...you'll love this movie!  Lots of non-stop action & many funny lines..believe it or not?  Won't win an Academy award, but will fill any evening with entertaining fun!!!

B000FBJFSC|2.0|I read this book, it seemed to take forever. I wanted to finish because it was supposed to be amazing, I never found what so so great about the book. All I found was sadness - the children where put through a lot of unnecessary pain and sadness, I think I would have liked the book a lot more if he had put more of how his adult like turned out better than his childhood

B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was a xmas gift.  I don't know if she liked it or not but when I read the summary it seemed like it had a good message as well as being entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is probaly one of the best games ever made.I do wish however pocket edition would advance faster in some areas.cant wait till we get red stone to work or we get wolves or villagers or Tnt to work or sheers to work or for breeding to work.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|This is a gift she hasn't gotten yet but from what I can see of it I think she will like it.  I like that you can use it over and over again and I like that it's a dress up.  Reminds me of the old paper dolls.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Looking forward to watching this movie again and again.  I only wish that this would would offer a colorized version--would buy it in a minute.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved this movie right from the start.  It held your interest, the plot was easy to understand and it kept you on the edge of your seat.
B009A3NGF4|2.0|The band is good at what they do but the songs sound way too similar for me though. Having a style is one thing but I feel like I could tie all of these songs together in the middle and have it sound coherent. That is a problem.<br /><br />I have tried many times to get into then at the requests of friends but they are just so bland.<br /><br />I am a musician and a huge audiophile so I get that this just an opinion and this band isn't for me.<br /><br />By all means buy this you may love it. I do support their instrument choices though.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Enter the Dragon has been a cult classic since it came out. If you have never seen it before just remember that it was made 40 years ago. His sounds and movements have been mimicked in hundreds of movies, cartoons etc. to this very day. I saw it when it first came out and have in my collection of movie greats. But beware of 'Return of the Dragon'. Bruce Lee became such a huge star from this move and the movies he made in China that he thought he could write, produce, direct, and act in it. The movie is so bad you can't even watch it in it's entirety. Just skip to the end and watch the final fight and see Chuck Norris' first movie appearance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found this book on special for $.99, and it blew me away. Hopeless is such a powerful story.  Although some parts of the book were a bit predictable, this was the best book I've read in a very long time.
1423424514|4.0|I'm used to play and improvise on my instrument using the guitar chords so this publication serves well - especially together with play-along CD:s
1594745692|5.0|I bought the cards more for the imagery on them and I was not disappointed. They are absolutely beautiful. The instruction book is nice as well. I am new to tarot cards and it gave me a general overview that was easy to understand.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Ya it's grainy but so is the 35 mm print.  It's definitely a MAJOR upgrade from the DVD so don't be fooled by what other people write.  If your a fan of movies or simply the Godfather then this is one purchase you have gone to long without.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|IF YOU LOVE DRIVING THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU ME AND MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR APPS AND GAMES JUST LIKE THIS AND SOON AS I SEEN IT I NEW IT WOULD BE GREAT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME ITS MILLIONS OF FUN
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Raiders in HD and the sound is even better than the picture.  And the HD picture is OUTSTANDING!!  Must buy.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a great memoir of a current event that just about everyone can relate to. I'm not a huge fan of war novels or war-action thrillers. I don't usually go for memoirs either, but this story struck a chord with me from the first paragraph and drew me onto the story. That, I feel, is the mark of a good story and a good author.<br /><br />Chris Kyle has a great way of telling his story that is so disarming, you almost don't realize your several chapters into it when you take a break. I think what also makes this story endearing is that we don't have just Mr. Kyles point of view, but commentary by his wife at key moments. This is a huge difference from most memoirs.<br /><br />This isn't just about the greatest U. S. sniper in the last 40 years. It's about all of the facets of his life that made him what he is today. Anyone wanting to find out what it's actually like to walk in his boots for a while should read this book.
1878424602|5.0|I love it.<br />I discovered that there is a new way to live life.<br />Calmer, in harmony and that helps bring peace to yourself.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone that has been living life 1 way and its not really working for them. If they think of a change - try to follow the 7 Spiritual Laws.
B000I3PERS|5.0|For some reason I always thought this was a chick flick, probably because the women at work made jokes about seeing Mel Gibson's butt.  So, I never bothered watching this.  Then I was it on Amazon Instant Video and read the description, and realized this wasn't a chick flick, gave it a shot and loved it.  An epic film well worth watching.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Read the reviews, and am going to read it this week. I'm a fan of fantasy, so I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this book!
B00BOL22GY|5.0|Another show I thought I'd give a try thanks to a free episode from Amazon.  A very intriguing show that doesn't hold anything back and is fun to watch.  Keep it coming.  I look forward to each new episode.  Well done!
0385344333|1.0|I agree with the other negative reviews of this bomb.  I love Lee Child and Jack Reacher.  One of the reasons for that is that he's got brass balls.  He fights all wrongs, isn't afraid to get involved and, in general, is just a step below a super hero.  I pre-ordered this book and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  I dropped the other 2 books I was reading and jumped into A Wanted Man.  I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was.  A highly unlikely plot, a total lack of action and rather bogus ending.  Please, Lee, let's have the real Jack Reacher back. As an FYI, there were at least 4 opportunities for Reacher to show his stuff in this book.  He let every one of them pass. Sorry, Lee, this is the first one I didn't like. I hope Reacher gets lots of rest, gets pissed off at someboday, kicks ass and takes names in the next episode.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Me and my daughter sophia, (15 mos) love the movie and she knows what movie it is every time the opening song comes on! Great movie!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|too habit forming!!! it makes me crazy, I can't stop playing it.  I wish it didn't move around so much
B005MQW5RI|3.0|Overall this was a cute movie with a decent theme - Good triumphs over evil. If you are looking for a good 3D experience, this is NOT it. A cute movie for kids.
B0009QZ4CE|4.0|I've been a fan of this band for about ten years. I don't remember them from the 70s (I'm that old) but I discovered them kinda late. In the years I've been into Prog VDGG is a band that I've loved from a distance. It's not stuff I listen to on a regular basis but every now and then I get an itch for some quirky, wierd, symphomic prog/rock. I've read about Godbluff for years. Never heard it until I bought it recently. I have 4 other VDGG albums. My favorite is still &#34;Pawn Hearts.&#34; Set that one in stone.<br /><br />Godbluff took a few spins to grow on me, but I knew from the first second that this album was claasic VDGG. Favorite track is &#34;Scorched Earth.&#34; The album is a monster of prog. If you like King Crimson or early Genesis you'll probably like Van Der Graaf Generator. Godbluff is as good as anywhere to start (except the 21st century re-union albums. Start with Godbluff or Pawn Hearts). Highly recommended. If you like British, symphonic/prog and you haven't heard VDGG, you owe it to yourself to get this album (or any VDGG album).
030758836X|3.0|Did not live up to the book's hype. All the sex descriptions added nothing to the plot,seemed the sex was put in for fillers.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I wanted to read the book initially because of the movie reviews. It was not a disappointment. It kept me wondering what he had done to be &#34;in the bad place&#34;. I am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|The bad reviews on this device may be prior to the 3.0 firmware update/application for the Eagle Eye and/or may be from people who just didn't take the time to calibrate it properly or tweak it.<br /><br />That being said, just as background and setup, I'm a mid-30's gamer who grown up rocking the FPS online PC games all the way back to the original Quake1&2, Wolfenstein and the ever awesome Half Life on those fantastic dial ups.  It's ingrained that a keyboard and mouse are the necessary tools for an FPS.  I transitioned to the PS3 because of the expense of continually updating my gaming rig each year and in buying the PS3 I've gone though quite a few Keyboard/Mouse setups for it.  Most noteable is the SplitFish series of PS3/xBox mouse setups.<br /><br />The SplitFish has it's advantages with an easy plug'n play, but the calibration, adjustments and precision are far lacking in comparison to the Eagle Eye.  Moving from one game to the next you find the SplitFish 'feeling' is way different on each game.  Now this isn't a review on the SplitFish, but a review on the Eagle Eye.  I have had more issues trying to dial in and change and setup the SplitFish to get the PC Game feel and in the end had no luck.  The SplitFish will never feel like a PC game setup.  Period.  I eventually just &#34;lived with it&#34;.... until I jumped the CoD line and moved to BF3 where the SplitFish is completely and utterly useless by the stair effect.<br /><br />Being useless I moved onto another Mouse/Keyboard setup and bought the Eagle Eye.  I was weary based on some of the review, but I'm happy I bought it.  Here, let me say that again in big'ol letters I&#34;M HAPPY I BOUGHT IT.  It's far beyond the SplitFish setup.<br /><br />I'm running an older 3500 dpi Razer Deathadder with the Razer Nostromo as my keyboard and, no joke, DonkeyTron!  Let me translate DonkeyTron.... yeah, it friggin rocks.  The Eagle Eye recognized both hardware and worked perfectly.  It's not exactly like playing on a PC, but it is so so very close.  You get precise aiming movements and the ability to have all your key command / usage buttons at your finger tips and it was fairly easy to setup and be up and running/playing in minutes with something that will 'work' and 'dominate'.  I say that because, you are able to do a pretty quick setup and have the thing working much better than any other keyboard/mouse combos I've tried, but to really get it super dialed in to your preference it takes a couple more minutes to tweak things.  (Caveat:  I'm super picky about how my hardware performs, so this could just be me.)<br /><br />SETUP:  The instructions are a little lacking (box instructions), but the setup is fast and easy.  If you're on Linux you're SOL and will have to find a Windows machine.<br /><br />The one thing they leave out of the setup is that the keyboard and mouse that you're going to be using with the PS3 need to be plugged into the windows machine and the drivers HAVE to be installed.  For some crazy reason (early morning) I totally missed this and took me 5 minutes to &#34;think&#34; about it.<br /><br />The Eagle Eye comes with the 3.0 firmware and software and it's super easy to setup ad use.  Once running, it's a matter of clicking on the PS3 button shown in the wonderful example PS3 controller image (in app) and then clicking the keyboard or mouse button that you want to assign it to.  Once that's done, then it's a matter of taking all three devices and hooking them up to your PS3.  TaDa!<br /><br />USE:  I've had some uber bad stair effect with many mouse/keybaord combos for the PS3, but it's nearly non-existent with the Eagle Eye.  In BF3, the SplitFish is almost un-playable, but with the Eagle Eye there's no stair effect - it's smooth, precise and fast.<br /><br />I did run into the 'slow turning' that some people mentioned.  If you have you're ingame settings too low then, when you try and 360 spin turn (like you can in PC FPS games) you'll have to pick your mouse up and slide it multiple times.  This is just a matter of taking the time to dial in the settings.  Once dialed in this is a great product.<br /><br />CONS:  Instructions are very short, but then when you run the app there's sidebar instruction that run you through things.  Could they be a little more detailed?  Yes.  Do they give you enough information?  Sure.<br /><br />It is wired.  The Eagle Eye device, that is.  To me, this really isn't a huge con, but it does add some more cords to your gaming setup.<br /><br />PROS: Price.<br />Easy setup.<br />Solid product - doesn't seem like it's going to break.<br />Supported Hardware - the list is very long and includes some great gaming keyboards/mice.<br />Online support - there's a ton of documentation and information online.<br />Multiple Key Mappings - this allows you to setup more than one mapping for the device.  e.g. I have two on mine right now.  One for BF3 and one for CoD since there's a slight variation in the buttons and I can adjust the aiming speeds for each.<br />PC FPS Feel - well, almost PC feel.  It's pretty damn close and I've used almost every keyboard/mouse setup for the PS3.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like it.<br />It is really really fun.<br />There was a 1 or 2 hard levels.<br />The rest were pretty easy.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I would reccomend this product to anyone.  I love it because it is so much fun to play.  I also like the fact that you don't have to have wi-fi to play.
B008602KQI|5.0|this movie is a must see film packed with drama, a lot of action, and some death. (you don't see the people dying)
0061673730|2.0|I wanted to like this book, because it came highly recommended by many people.  However I found myself almost forcing myself to pick it up and read it. It is set maybe 30 years ago in a different era so some of the slang may not make sense.  The author goes on a motorcycle trip and keeps jogging his memory of his earlier years.  It makes you think about things in a different way, which is good, but not my style.

B00AIUUXHC|1.0|When I first got it it was an ok game then I hated it so I deleted it then got it again was fun but I kept dying and you loose gems and don't get them back until the next day don't get it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The kids and I love this game, we play it separately and together (on one account).  It is entertaining, nonviolent, and really enjoyable for all ages.<br /><br />The only caution from us is to password your purchase abilities.  You don't have to spend real cash to play,  but you can end up spending real cash easily to hurry things along (for gems, dragon treats, and game coins).<br /><br />It's fun!
0061692034|5.0|In discussing \\"Canada\\" with The Guardian, Richard Ford talked about the concept of \\"normal\\" and how we develop constructs to help us deal with reality. Said Ford: \\"Internal chaos does not suit us and we can't cope with it for very long.\\"<br /><br />So in \\"Canada,\\" Ford gives teenage Montana boy Dell Parsons a heap of internal chaos. First, his parents (otherwise decent people) rob a bank. Next, having moved to Canada to start a new life, Dell witnesses a double murder and helps bury the bodies. And he keeps the secret.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" is right up there with Richard Ford's best work--as deep and complex as anything he's done.<br /><br />The prose is spare and beautiful. The voice is reflective. The events in \\"Canada\\" are being told with the advantage of five decades of perspective. So the pace is calm and the overall tone is passive.<br /><br />The story is about assimilation and the ability to start fresh.  \\"Canada\\" is watching your parents vanish quickly and then working to settle in to a new country, a new family dynamic and observing your own morals and personality take shape.  And it's about wondering how much of the past will catch up with you.<br /><br />Dell's guardian in Canada, Arthur Remlinger, also has a dark incident in his past. Being found staying in \\"tiny, faraway Saskatchewan\\" is what draws investigators north across the border. Remlinger's decision to move across the border was \\"unexplained\\" and, therefore, suspicious. (Perfect.)<br /><br />Dell's twin sister is Berner, who plays a key role both in the opening section of the book and in the serene finish. In-between, To Dell, Canada \\"might seem like a long way away from everything\\" but it really isn't. Canada may be across a border and might be another country and Dell thinks about becoming a Canadian \\"which would not be a big change\\" but it's enough, perhaps, to declare a new life. Maybe.<br /><br />In the end, Dell becomes a teacher and later encourages his students \\"to think of their existence on the planet not as a catalog of random events endlessly unspooling--but as a life--both abstract and finite.\\"  He encourages students to look straight at the things they can see in broad daylight.<br /><br />\\"In the process of articulating to yourself the things you see, you'll always pretty well make sense and learn to accept the world.\\" Or, perhaps, develop a story that makes all the pieces fit.e on the planet not as a catalog of random events endlessly unspooling--but as a life--both abstract and finite.\\"  He encourages students to look straight at the things they can see in broad daylight.<br /><br />\\"In the process of articulating to yourself the things you see, you'll always pretty well make sense and learn to accept the world.\\" Or, perhaps, develop a story that makes all the pieces fit.

B00005JLF5|3.0|Star Trek Ds 9 is my favorite Star Trek series. The first season, however, was only fair.  Over time DS 9 would grow.  The characters were strong, the stories good, and the moral questions ( which all Star Trek series ask ) were exceptionally good, and didn't provide the easy answers that one found in the other series, particuarly Then Next Generation.<br /><br />The really story arc doesn't begin until about the third season, but a grouding in the first two seasons will help you to appreciate later seasons.  So even though the first season was only fair, I suggest watching it and staying with it, because the show will get better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this show!! I've loved PBS since I was a kid, and they always put out great period piece programs!<br />A must see!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Enjoyable story.  Hopefully this will aid people's understanding of mental health issues.  I also enjoyed the movie, although it omitted some events covered in the book.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I really liked this book. It was a little hard to follow in the beginning, several decades were covered in a short time, and keeping names straight was a little tricky. Once the story got going with Leo, it was hard to put down. This was my first book by Smith, a freebie for Kindle, I will be checking out the other two books in the trilogy.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I LOVE Sherlock Holmes stories, and have read all stories by Doyle concerning him. I was very skeptical about this series but it really is great fun. It's a modern setting, and they do their best to translate the story into something believable in this day and age. The actors do their job very well, and were well chosen. Lovers of the novels will recognize bits and pieces of several stories in each episode, not individual stories.So, don't expect classic Shelock, more a translation into modern times, great acting, and very entertaining.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I enjoyed it very very much. I loved the music and the cat outfilts. Percect performence. Keep it up. Yea
B0055QYKQO|4.0|The Geek Squad tells you to plan the installation of your components in the tower/mid/mini.  I am always falling down on that like a Chef that changes his mind in the middle of cooking a delicate recipe.  This board can handle multiple mind changes and still run fast and quiet.  Things are clearly labeled and almost easy to install.  I would give it a five, but the connections for the HDDs and BRD player is very low on the MB. Otherwise, I love it!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|It's rare for a music album to catch your attention with the first song, keep you wanting to listen through, and in the end have an incredible finish. NATIVE does just that.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|A little romance, fast boats, curious deaths/illnesses, chasing the bad guys, saving the environment of a Third World country and a little bit of &#34;What if . . . &#34;.  It's a great movie and leaves you wanting to see more.  Reminds me of why I liked McConaughey in U-571
0525953728|5.0|Great book.  These brave men are the true American heroes.  Great to know the story from from someone who was there.
B000069HZP|5.0|Even when the movie is over and the game has supposedly stopped, is it really over or is this another phase of the game?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Exemplifies the strength of the human spirit and a boy's ability to cope in unique ways when tragedy strikes; extremely powerful.
B000O6XMKU|5.0|Great insight into how we got from there to here and why things are still happening that go back to this century.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the book. A co-worker recommended this book and she was right. It is a page turner and kept me guessing. Beware of the foul language. Other than that great book. Can't wait to read some of her other books.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|An all-star cast makes this a great movie.  Willis carries it so well and understated--his character is believable as well as those characters he plays to find out who put a hit out on him.  Each actor that is introduced adds another flavor.  The special effects are great--especially where Willis' character is stepping out of the car in New Orleans--how do they do that!!!??  Parker's portrayal of the bored government worker and the slightly over-her-head situations her character finds herself in makes the movie all the more believable and fun.  Helen Miran is great especially as she shares that her character takes on the odd outside assignment when she misses the old days.  Morgan Freeman's scene in the nursing home with the TV is funny and Malkovich is the perfect actor to play his character.  This is also Ernest Borgnine's last movie before he passed away--he had &#34;It&#34; until the end.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book. I immediately bought the next book in the series. Can't wait for the 3rd book now.
1250027624|5.0|I bought this book for my birthday and am enjoying it ever so much!  The photography is every bit as sharp as in the first Downton book.  I am enjoying the focus on each character as well as the other information about the time period.  I can't imagine any fan of Downton Abbey not being delighted with this book!
0425263916|5.0|I could not put it down. I can not wait for the next book in the series to come out.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The ending surprised me, which doesn't happen often.  Great Read for those who love vivid language and suspense.  Adora and Amma are the epitome of evil.
0345529057|5.0|So glad I just bought all 4 at once - you tear through them faster than you'd think.  The book holder they come in is nice (and I especially loved it because Daenerys is on the other side ^_^)<br /><br />For those not familiar with the books, I recommend it as a good blind buy.
1452105111|5.0|We were quite pleased with this garland! It is so easy to spell out anything you wish...there are LOTS of letters included, as well as a large amount of ribbon to string the letters on. The letters do not shift about easily, so they stay put when you hang the garland. The letters are made of a thick paper/cardboard, so they will survive several parties. This garland accented our Very Hungry Caterpillar party perfectly.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It is great for just playing and relaxing. Even fun for adults. Loved
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great book, well written, the characters are believable and well developed.  Plenty of action, with just the right mix of magic. Really looking forward to the next one.
098555780X|5.0|I got three other Paracord books at same time.<br />This book stood out miles ahead of the others.<br />Not only in sheer variety of knots, but the quality, detail & organization is impeccable.<br />A lot of time has been dedicated to the quality of photos, each are clear & great size for learning how to make each knot step by step.<br />I wish all instructional books would take lessons from JD. He's a master teacher. Bravo👏
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It is a great color purple, and it protects the fire like it is supposed too.  works well standing up also.
0375842209|5.0|This book says much about human nature, spirituality and life on earth. It provides an insight into German culture, sentiment and history which is different from any such portal previously available to me.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I first discovered Nightwish a couple of years ago and had been listening to their earlier work with lead singer Tarja Turunen.  When Tarja was replaced by Annette Olzon I just couldn’t seem to muster up much enthusiasm for the group since what I heard with Annette in the lead just didn’t seem to measure up. Therefore I didn’t purchase Dark Passion Play and initially didn’t pay much attention to Imaginarium. I eventually was exposed to some of the songs on Imaginarium via Pandora and liked what I heard enough to decide to purchase the CD. After playing the album a few times I had the urge to play it again, and again, and again. I started to realize that I was becoming addicted to the music like it was some sort of drug that I just had to have; I couldn’t stop myself from hitting the replay button.<br /><br />Nightwish is more about the music than any one particular component such as whose singing lead. Annette is simply not the singer that Tarja is but her vocals fit the songs on this album well and she does a really good job. Her voice is better suited for some of the softer songs like Turn Loose the Mermaids and The Crow, the Owl and the Dove but she sounds terrific on all the songs really.<br /><br />This album emphasizes the symphonic component of the music more than any of their other works which I suppose is due to it being essentially a movie soundtrack. That being said, the only word that really seems to describe this album is epic. It’s big, complex, powerful and simply amazing. It’s truly a work of art. It’s probably the best album I’ve heard in a decade and will undoubtedly go down as one of my favorites of all time. Thank you Nightwish, you have enriched my life with this music.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose this rating, because I love reading the Bible and with this app I can do that so easily.  Plus I love being able to be able to access all the different translations.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Everything about this series is perfect for the entire family... singing, dancing, humor, drama and an over all feel good movie!
B008JFQKN4|5.0|Green Day is amazing. one of the best rock bands ever. These 3 albums were all great. i cant wait for the next ones!

B00B99KJR0|4.0|I enjoy this game.  Exactly what I thought it was going to be. Nice. Now I'm just writing words to reach the minimum!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Very well made game with good graphics. The controls were slightly unresponsive at times, but very rarely. The game was also very short unless I missed something. The length pretty much depends on how you adapt to the playstyle, but there are 30 levels
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Rise of the Guardians is a movie that is fun for all ages, the kids will love the quirky characters and cool animations and the adults will like the references to all those fantasies you believed in as a kid.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but it has been a great way to kill time when I am just waiting. It's worth recommending.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|keeps you interested till the very end.  you won't get bored.  lots of different types of puzzles.  and very low cost.  would. recommend. to others.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I took my time buying this book since I wasn't a huge Tina Fey fan, but I was finally talked into it by a fellow improv classmate. I take the bus to work and often read while commuting. This book is laugh out loud funny, and I'm bummed I waited so long to laugh during my commutes! I could totally relate to many of Tina's hilarious stories. And as a fellow improvisor, I appreciated what she went through. This book is a MUST BUY IT NOW ALREADY!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Our pre-school grandson is now dressing the part of Puss N Boots. Enough said, the kids love it and so do the parents
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is an alright app. It needs some work though. You don't have buckets and you can't build roller coasters. I'm waiting for the disc edition on the Xbox 360.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Please make more!! I loved this mind challenging game.  A good buy that you won't be able to put down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book is the best , better than the first two books!! You're going to like the book very much . (Emily)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved the book I just hope there is a 2nd book with Abby and Trav I'm looking forward to reading walking disaster
8866137634|4.0|Perfect size, portable but holds enough text unlike the smaller moleskines which I've bought but just aren't practical for me.  Conceptually I love being able to photograph & upload to Evernote...and I do this when I have time.  The extra step is worth it to have access on paper & electronically.  But having never tried to photo & upload from a normal Moleskine I can't say this is any better than the norm.  Very satisfied in general.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|The wife and I just love to watch this movie and on Blu Ray there is a new dimension added to ones viewing pleasure.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Funny, Emotional and reflexive without being excessive. Minor flaws but well balanced. Full of hope and enthusiasm. An enjoyable overall reading.
B000W4HIXQ|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite movie. This was a gift that she loves and enjoys watching on our big screen TV.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I'm a big fan of the original series and am happily surprised that this new continuation is being made with another wonderful cast, even bringing back my favorite \\"downstairs\\" character with original actress. The storyline catches your interest, does a nice job of incorporating history with social drama, and keeps me looking forward to the next episode. Kudos to BBC for producing wonderful historical dramas.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I was able to get caught up on The Walking Dead. I came in after season 3.5 was over and if it wasn't for this I would have been unable to get caught up. Now waiting on all season to come out in Blu Ray.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I really like this app. Very convenient and flexible. The \\"notebook\\" metaphor works for me. The only thing I'd like is the ability to save the text ... somewhere (in the \\"cloud\\" perhaps?) as a text file. You might be working on a book on your Kindle (or other android device) and also on a PC. It would be nice to have an easy way to merge text from the Kindle to your doc file on your PC. I know you can email your notebook as a PDF, but extracting the text from a PDF is a royal pain. Maybe you can export TEXT from this app, but it's not obvious to me. This \\"inter-device\\" linkage is missing, as far as I can tell. But, again, I think it's a wonderful app. I'd give it five stars if this were not an issue.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love playing but I paid money for several puzzle packs and they disappeared.  No response from customer service on how to get them back.  Love the game but don't like losing money.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fun to play.  Reminds me of the good old days!!  Could have better instructions re: how to move your man.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've tried lots of different types of ear buds for running and gym workouts, and I've honestly liked these the best because they stay in even when I'm sweaty. They aren't the fanciest, but that's okay with me, because I won't feel bad if I lose them to or from the gym someday - but so far, they are worth the money 100%.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Could not put down and will have a hard time starting another book at this time. Best fiction I have read in a long time.
1451696191|5.0|I LOVE this book, great for every age, nice story, great style, very inspirational. This book is great and I recommend it to everyone I know.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|My late night DVD movie for last night was \\"12 Monkeys (Special Edition)\\" starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. It was one of those time-travel thingies where people were flitting back and forth from the past to the present in order to somehow save the future. Personally, I don't care to watch such hocus-pocus, but this one was rather well done. It took a while for me to adjust, but the story became almost believable and even touching in a few places. Well, it had a lot of good acting in it, but I think Brad Pitt overdid his part and actually detracted from the story. See if you can't somehow tune him out. Otherwise, the story was well put together and rather gripping. I'd have to credit it for being well filmed and well directed and the special effects were impressive. Relax and see if you can't let yourself ease into  the story, and I think you'll enjoy the  film.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004UID2LC|1.0|I'm using this on my kindle fire it's really bad I don't recommend downloading this . It's a waste of time.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|This is a very nice album full of beautiful music and a great deal of atmosphere.  But didn't the producers think that some english listeners would like to know what Mr. Bocelli and company are singing about.<br />There are lyrics in the various languages sung on the album in the accompanying notes but no translations.  Some of the songs, especially those sung in Napolitan, are especially difficult to translate.<br /> It does make a difference knowing what the song is about.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this app, you really can do all the things you could do with a regular horse in real life, you can feed groom buy stuff and earn stuff even enter competitions and win prizes. You can also send gifts with friends that you make, like coins and stuff. The reason I give it four stars is because buying the gems are way expensive and is a bit of a rip off, but if you block buying gems and coins with your money it is a great game, hopefully they make a second My Horse and have it filled with all the things you can't do on the first one. Hope this is helpful!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is fantastic for all who enjoy RPGs. They should seriously consider making another game, or possibly adding to this one.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a very fun &#34;Run through it&#34; game. The graphics are great and the gameplay is seemless. Fun stuff, almost better than the movie!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Been looking forward to this album. Unique sound very well produced. Not a bad song in the set. Well done.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an amazing book I cried at the end of the book because I didn't want it to end!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LOVE this app! its really fun to experiment with the heir. The only downside is that it gets kind of boring but its a great time passer
B004EJUMT2|5.0|To be honest, I didn't know what to think when I bought this album. I knew it was getting keen reviews from online sources, and a few friends had heard it; all very satisfied. So I took a chance and bought it. DAMN! if you like King Diamond, BOC, or and classic metal, give this a try.<br /><br />the vocals are very clean, no death screams or grunted words here; just honest singing. that being said, this guy isn't an extremely powerful vocalist; dare I say a bit thin sounding. but, stylistically, the style fits into the whole 'creepy, abandoned church now haunted by hell's hounds, welcome to your nightmare' sort of vibe I get from this record. Furthermore, the background harmonies help to empower the rather wanting lead.<br /><br />The guitar; phenomenal. It's not flashy, but, in the style of classic metal, very solid. the guitar tone, similarly, takes me to an early (pre- hell bent for leather) Judas Priest, but slightly more \\"jagged,\\" if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Much like the guitar, the individual instrument parts of this album are not ultra flashy, as they can be in extreme metal. All of those aspects are very minimal, letting the storyline and melody take prevalence, which brings me to my final point. the songwriting itself, however satanic the lyrics may be, is the strong point of this album. these guy's know how to write a song that'll keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />one minor gripe, and I do mean minor, is that the songs sometimes seem to end right as they start to grab your attention. this isn't too noticeable, except when listening with a critical ear.<br /><br />All in all, this album is likely the best in the modern days of rock music, let alone metal (another time, another place). All in all, buy it. you will not regret it.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I saw this movie when it was in theaters (not the 3D version) and it's AMAZING!<br />If I could, I would have gone back to see it over and over again. So lucky that<br />my birthday just passed and someone got it for me!<br /><br />This movie is for all ages. I'm in my mid-twenties and just love this so much.<br />The kids and parents in the theater all laughed together and it's such an enjoyable<br />movie. You can't go wrong getting this!
B001MTENOC|5.0|I gave the book 5 stars .It was a good read but made me feel a little uneasy. After my son died in 2005 I started reading anything and everything I could get my hands on on this subject. I started to feel much more at ease knowing I would see him again. And it made accepting his death much easier. But there were things in this book that went way beyond what I had imagined heaven to be like after reading at least a hundred other books and having many readings by psychic mediums. For instance one girls recall of going back to the spirit world and seeing her father from afar but not being able to go to him. She was agitated to say the least. And the small soul groups that he says people are divided into on the other side to reincarnate with. Making it seem like souls really only are close to a few other souls on the other side.  Then someone else's memory makes it sound like there is complete freedom to roam on the other side. To be honest, I wish I hadn't read the book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the way the game is set up, but, I THINK 'IT' HAS IT 'IN' FOR ME....I RARELY WIN!! HA HA HA :)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|At first I struggled reading this book. In the beginning the book is a little bogged down with detail. Alas, the book got very interesting and then t couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the other two.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I didn't like it, so I don't use it ..... I am used to Facebook, soooo, enough said, I guess
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|HITCHCOCK has been inspired by the true-life story of how the film PSYCHO was created.  It affords another opportunity for Anthony Hopkins to give one of his bravura performances in the central role.  In truth, he does not look much like Hitch, but he captures the voice inflections very well.  As Alma Reville, Helen Mirren does not have too much to do, other than to demonstrate her loyalty to her husband, despite his unhealthy obsessions with his leading ladies.  In this film, it is Janet Leigh (played with calm authority by Scarlett Johansson).  The film suggests that much of the violence in PSYCHO stemmed from Hitchcock's own sexual frustrations; there is one sequence in particular, showing the director scaring the understudy to death as he performs the stabbing in the now-legendary shower scene.  Another interesting aspect of the film is the link drawn between the protagonist of Bloch's novel - that provided the source for PSYCHO - and Hitchcock's stage of mind at the time of filming it.  On this view, PSYCHO is one of his most personal films.  The film begins and ends with the music from ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, in a move designed to appeal to nostalgia buffs.  All in all, an entertaining piece.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I love, love, love this movie. Whenever it's on one of my cable stations I have to stop and watch parts of it. Great cast, believable performances, mostly believable story line, and a very sweet love story. Dex (the main male character) says the sweetest things to one of the female characters. I wasn't very familiar with John Krasinski (who is superb in this movie) but after watching him in this movie, I've come to appreciate his talents. In conclusion, as in real life, sometimes finding or losing or keeping the one you love doesn't always go the way you thought it would. This is a feel good movie about love and relationships. You won't be disappointed.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I got this with a little hesitation due to the price but to my surprise it works great I have worn them for hours at a time, my ears get a little sore when wearing them for long periods but so due the turtle beach head sets- I put a little cotton into the cushining and viola no more irritation can wear them all day now and for the price I couldn't beat it.
B00AEFYWJG|5.0|Great suspense movie. Characters are believable. The movie keeps your interest because surprising events take place in quite a few of the scenes throughout the movie. Each character contributes greatly to the plot. Each actor is really enjoyable to watch and delivers a believable performance. If you haven't seen this movie, or read the book, you must do it. This is a movie to have in your media library.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This is a good CD. The show is great and usually enjoy the music so it made since to buy this
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Being one who owns most every edition of this production that has been released, I highly anticipated seeing this version.  I was not disappointed and would suggest that even those who are not overly fond of musicals would appreciated this.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Lincoln kept reseting (I streamed the Movie). I finally shut it down and lost my $4.99. Beware when streaming unless you want to take a chance of lossing your money.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A very intense movie that certainly holds your attention.  Even knowing the history and the outcome of the situation, it still kept you on the edge of your seat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game.  The game is very interesting,fun,exciting and addictive. Love the game, although I can't figure out how to download the Rome update.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a very interesting movie.  The visual effects and captivating.  A movie that might need to be seen more than once to take it all in.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|This is such an enchanting novel, showing both the naiveness of a young girl, and a look into the life of a famous painter. Even if it is fictional. You can really feel the perils of society in that time period, and the struggles Griet deals with.<br /><br />Although wary at first, after 20 or so pages I was transported into the realm of the book and was very pleased with how good the story was.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a production I enjoyed more the second time than the first.  Now it has become one I will watch again.  I would suggest, from our experience, that it is better to watch this movie in either DVD or Blue-ray rather than 3D.
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|I am more used to her jazz work, and while her renditions are OK, they are not the jazzthat we know and love.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|We have been very pleased with the DVD.  The acting is superb and there was a lot of interesting information.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I caught the second act of this concert on P.B.S a while back and I liked it so I bought it. Unfortunatley I wish I had seen the first act. I was very unhappy with the Vulgarity and Raunchy-ness of Lovely Ladies and Master of the House. Also the excessive use a certain swear word was Very unnecessary. But despite this it is a beautiful story with a gloriouse score and I enjoyed it Immensly so here is my character by character review.<br /><br />Jean Valjean- The main charcter in the story of les Miserables and let me tell you Alfie Bow was PERFECT!! His voice is AWESOME and he puts sooo much into his performance. His Bring him home was GORGEOUS and a definite highlight of the show.<br /><br />Javert- Norm Lewis is fantastic in this role his Star actually had me crying. He may be an unconventional Javert to most of you Philip Quast fans but no one can deny that he should have been in the movie instead of YOU KNOW WHO. Norm Lewis is great as Javert and shall forever be THE Javert in my mind.<br /><br />Fantine- In the role of fantine wwe have another Huge name Lea Salonga. Her facial emotions were spot on and her voice is beautiful. I literally cried when she became a prostitute. I was like &#34;POOR FANTINE&#34; Her I dreamed a dream was also another tear jerker (In case you haven't guess I cried a WHOLE LOT while watching this)<br /><br />Marius- Now there has been a lot of angry word about Nick Jonas in the role of Marius and I will admit I was Horrified when I saw he was in this but I still watched it and Nobody kill me but I really liked his Marius. He brought a softness to the character that I feel was laking in Michael Balls Legendary performance in the 10th anniversary concert. Overall he did a great job and his voice is very smooth. But I can never forgive Marius for not loving Eponine :).<br /><br />Cosette- Oh Cosette as beautiful as you are I can never forgive you for stealing Marius from Eponine. but Katie Hall I can forgive because her voice is lovely and she captures all of the innocence sweetness a cosette must have.<br /><br />Eponine- Now we are onto my favorite female Character in the show. Samantha Barks IS Eponine she has crazy awesome vocals and she can belt like insanity. Her on my own is Great and I weeped when she and Nick sang a little fall of rain.<br /><br />Enjolras- I will tell you straight off Enjolras is my favorite person in the show he has all the best songs and he is awesome. But the best thing about this Enjolras is RAMIN KARIMLOO IS HIM!!!!! Ramin Karimloo is my favorite singer ever so this Enjolras obviously is AMAZING he can sing like.... I can't even explain how Awesome he is! Just look him up on youtube or something.<br /><br />The Thenardians- I will tell you right off the bat I don't like these characters. I just don't but I will admit I laughed once or twice so I guess they did there job.<br /><br />This is the end of my review so I hope it helps. If you do buy this movie I would caution you on the Raunchy-ness of certain parts and the over-usage of swear words. But overall it is a heartwarming story with great music and....RAMIN KARIMLOO. He makes everything better :)!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a movie I would recommend that everyone see.  It allows an insight into deeper facets of the presidency and the character of Abraham Lincoln.  All of the actors did an excellent job portraying the historical characters.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This POTO is AMAZING! I love it so much that I'm smiling just thinking about it! So here is a review of each of the aspects of the show<br /> The Phantom- It's Ramin Karimloo do I need to say more? He has the voice of an angel and he is so emotional in this performance that I cry every time I see it. Sorry all you Michael Crawford fans but Ramin will forever be MY absolutely favorite phantom.<br /><br />Christine- Sierra Boggess is an Awesome Christine. I would commit murder to be able to sing like her and she is really pretty. While most people say her wishing you were some how here again was their favorite thing she did mine was in music of the night. YOU CAN SEE HER CRYING and at that moment I was like she isn't playing Christine she IS Christine.<br /><br />Roal- There is alot of controversy on Hadley's Roal but I personally loved his interpretation. My favorite thing he did was before All I ask of you when Christine starts crying HE ROLLS HIS EYES!!!! I laughed so hard he is too fantastic.<br /><br />Carlotta and the fat guy(Sorry I can't spell his name.)- What can I say they are HYSTERICAL.<br /><br />Opera House Managers- These guys are great character actors. They may overact at times but hey, it adds to the charm in my book.<br /><br />Madame Gyrie- I don't really like madame Gyrie. She is kinda weird and Gothic and she carries around a stick but hey she can sing so whatever.<br /><br />Meg- Oh Meg confusing as your mother I still love your character and your angel of music duet with Christine is Beautifully done. And...... You look so scared when you run around singing &#34;The phantom of the opera&#34; at the top of your lungs so Bravo!<br /><br />This concludes my review on the character and I just have to say BUY THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOE IT IS AMAZING!!! It is officially my favorite movie EVER!
B00BR476TG|5.0|Excellent movie. Similar to Tom Hanks movie where he is stranded but this is captivating. Good to watch with family.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One of the most real to life movies and story lines I've seen in a long time. No need for all the Hollywood glitz and glamor and fantasy characters in this movie, Denzel Washington provides TOP NOTCH riveting and very real acting for the character in this movie. He is truly one of the BEST actors on the Big Screen. I do believe he is the ONLY actor who could have \\"LANDED\\" this role !!!<br /><br /> Hat's off to you Mr. Denzel Washington, Bravo, GREAT Performance !!!
B0038QN2AS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, even just after finishing it, I bought the second one without hesitation. It is simple, if you like the subject, you like the book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Although the game is free.  If you want to play for long periods of time you will need to buy either coins or diamonds.  However you can play for shorter times and wait for your energy to regenerate.  I have several pay as you go games that I play and then take a break and start again.<br /><br />Great graphics and the ease that you can get friends and thus gifts.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Since I'm a big James Bond fan, I really enjoyed this!<br />Daniel Craig is my next to the favorite Bond because<br />no one can beat Sean Connery. Craig continues to<br />please in this movie.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I purchased this movie as a bridal shower gift and with a gift certificate to a French restaurant. Instead of going to Paris, they can have Paris come to them.<br />Would recommend this movie to all ages! Cute storyline, no crude language or persuasive underlying tones as in some PG movies, a great ending!<br />The food looked very detailed and real! Don't watch this movie on an empty stomach.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Very disappointing. I expected this to be up to &#34;The Lord<br />of the Ring&#34; trilogy & it was not. It was a fairly short book and<br />I think it was a stretch to get three movies out of it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It's a really useful app... I can download movies to watch later... I can't complane. And the best part: free!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie even though you know how it ends.<br />For those of us who lived through this crisis and were riveted to the TV coverage, this<br />was an eye-opener to the behind the scenes happenings.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Almost immediately wants you to buy more lives and then locked up my kindle when I tried to exit. Pretty weak, unexciting game.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Much better than I thought. Wonderful performances by all stars despite some<br />bad reviews for Russell Crowe. He did well for such difficult material.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I still have not recieved my presale code,,please advise when I will recieve it.  I need it as soon as possible
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|A couple of things - I am a lefty and like watches made for lefty's.<br /><br />The watch case is BIG! Be ready for some real weight hanging on your arm.<br /><br />The face is cool BUT the hands and face are the same color so it is difficult to tell the time with a quick glance - you have to relaly stare at the watch face to make out the hour/minute.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|What a great page turner!  This book has the perfect blend of naughty and nice!<br />I look forward to reading more by Harlan Coben.
0887307280|1.0|Worthless book. Went right in to the yardsale pile in my garage. Hopefully someone will pay me a quarter for it.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The quality of the box as well Bue-ray extra bonus features are quite enriching of all work behind the scenes. A collection for the whole family.
1601251505|4.0|Good replacement for latest Runequest product.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the new Runequest system compare to the original chaosium or Avalon Hill products

1476734941|5.0|I'm one of those people who always has 10lbs to lose, and despite multiple diets over the past few years, I have only managed to gain and regain within the 5lb range (I've tried low carb, low kcal, retro Grapefruit/ 3 day diets, plant based, paleo, VLC, Atkins fat fast... you name it, I've tried it). Some how, I have never been able to stick to any of these diets, because ultimately, I get bored of them and start craving things like BBQ flavored Kettle Chips and Reeses pieces.<br /><br />For some reason, I managed to GAIN 4lbs during one of the elimination diets (yes, the one on the current NYT list) last month, spending miserable hours trying to ensure that I abstain from soy, gluten, dairy, etc etc etc. Miserable that I broke my weight record by 4lbs after being so \\"good\\" on a diet, I randomly looked up the diet books on amazon.co.uk. The Fast Diet came up, and I've never looked back since.<br /><br />What's amazing about the 5:2 diet is that you are allowed to eat whatever you want for the rest of the week. Now, I am one of those people who, when I'm told I can't eat a specific food group (carbs, sugar, artificial sweeteners, gluten, high GI foods, etc), I actually cannot stop thinking about them. This diet allows me to only watch what I eat for only 2 days a week, which --to me-- feels like a breeze, especially when I tell myself that I can eat whatever I want the next day. (Usually I just try to go to bed earlier so I can wake up early and start eating!!!) I've been repeatedly amazed when I discover that I've LOST weight after a week of cupcakes, fancy restaurant dinners, and the occasional reeses pieces indulgence. The key is really NOT to think about what to eat during the non-fast days. If you try to stick to a low kcal diet, or try to impose another diet during the non-fast days, it probably would not work as much. The whole point of the 5:2 diet is that it allows you a certain degree of freedom for most of the week where you have the flexibility to attendparties, go to business lunches, drink the occassional sugary cocktail, late night BonChon binge, etc.<br /><br />If you are one of those people with an avid social schedule, this diet would be PERFECT for you. If, on the other hand, you are one of those ppl who needs to be told exactly what to eat and would prefer an extremely structured plan, then something like Ian Smith's Shred would be optimal.<br /><br />Personally, I love this lifestyle. I normally just do Mondays and Thursdays for my fast days, which are days when I am busy and tend to \\"grab something\\" to eat anyways. I still have my weekends, and I can still schedule lunches and dinners and froyo/ burger/ tequila shot meetups with my friends MOST OF THE TIME, which is amazing considering the fact that this would be virtually impossible in any other diet. (Even for diets that allow you a \\"cheat day\\" (Choose to Lose, slow carb, etc)-- that's only 1 treat day, right? This diet allows for 5!!!) One you realize there are 5 days in the week in which you can eat anything, you tend to eat normally-- not binge-- which is exactly what happened to me.<br /><br />I've found out that this diet does not need much effort to stick to, since I am only paying attention 2 days/ week, instead of being super stressed out 24/ 7, thinking about what to eat next/ what to buy from grocery/ what I cannot eat. This allows me to stick to this diet during an important project. In the past, I would always gain weight during stressful periods, since I usually would not have the time to watch what I eat. This completely changed with the Fast Diet.<br /><br />One tip would be to bulk up on the veggies. One big bag of frozen broccoli is only 120kcals, and you can eat that with a steamed/ grilled chicken breast (140 kcals) and make it a quite filling dinner. The book contains quite a lot of recipes for the fast days as well, although I haven't really tried them since I've been too lazy to measure out everything. For on-the-go meals (for times when I am too lazy to cook), I tend to gravitate towards Vega One Bars, Journey Bars, fruits, and boiled eggs. (2 boiled eggs + 1 apple= about 250 kcals)<br /><br />Now, the results! Without much effort at all -- and in the midst of completing a huge, stressful, binge-inducing project -- I lost 7lbs in one month! That didn't feel like a diet at all! Simply amazing.
B005H1SDQU|2.0|Loved Genesis with Peter Gabriel.Afterwards what was art became just average pop.Beyond the Shrouded Horizon by Steve Hackett shows  that the members without Peter are just mediocre.
0307951529|5.0|I believe it is very clear how ideas are explained and based on real cases. There is a huge chance for everybody to implement these facts.
B00007J36V|5.0|Lived to its reputation as a classic. I enjoyed the entire album from start to finish. Sandy Dennys voice is ageless.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is my two year old daughter's favorite movie. She relates to Vanillope and loves the goofy but sweet demeanor of Ralph. The film never gets boring and the characters are perfection. We even have the soundtrack. Great film for the whole family!!
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Tom's books used to be great.  Now they are just so much print and a total waste of the readers time. I guess he will sell another million books, but this hasn't got it.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|Decent sound, good writing and nice musically. fills out a spot in my music for those days when blues and jazz aren't going to fit the bill. Got this version to see what was missing lyricaly. the music doesn't gain anything for the use of explicity.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Bought this together with Crucial F.A.S.T multitool for about the same price but has a lot more features and more practical. Very well built, except for the nylon sheath which doesn't look to last for a long use.
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|This is a great album musicaly. Gary Moore hits the sound very well and the addition of the Gypsey's on a few cuts is awesome. my only problem is that the sound is there but i keep being thrown off by it not being Hendrix's voice. don't get me wrong, the vocals are top notch but my brain won't wrap around the guitar work (and drums and bass) being so Jimi and the voice not. Glad i bought it, just need to get over my ears!
0345525558|3.0|When I first started reading the book it reminded me a bit of the book White Oleander, dealing with the issue of foster care and learning to trust when a person has grown up in a difficult circumstance. I expected it to be very sad because of the subject matter, but it really was not. At first I thought that  was a good thing as being introduced to The Language of Flowers was a very original idea and seemed to introduce the idea of healing through the beauty of flowers.  This aspect of the story  was interesting. The only thing is that somehow I felt that I was not really emotionally invested in the character. Aspects of the character felt so remote that I didn't feel that invested in what happened to her. The book also felt somewhat draggy.  I read the first half of the book and really enjoyed it but the second half started to drag. I thought the part about how she felt about her daughter rang true in the sense of feeling overwhelmed by the needs a child. Other aspects of the book just felt to unlikely, to be believable. The part about her flower business did not ring true, nor the relationship with Grant. I enjoyed about 60% of the book. loved about 10%  and was bored by about 30% of it.
141694740X|4.0|I received the book very quickly. I am presently reading the book and I am laughing my head off and well as being able to identify with a lot of what Greg is relating in the book. I have skopen with a number of men that are in my life and yes it's true with a number of men although individuals are still individuals. Nicely written.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a great game. The graphics are very pretty, and the soundtrack is easy on the ears. As some reviewers have mentioned, I found it pretty meditative moving my little cell around.

B00C1BU7V8|1.0|He was the Great Betrayer.<br /><br />He sold out the blacks, to win the war against the South.<br />He only freed them on a 'condition', that if they were<br />duly convicted of a crime, they would become a slave<br />again.  Sorry folks, but all those convicted blacks in<br />jail, having been duly convicted are not citizens, but slaves.<br />Sad to say, but true.  read it and weep.  There is an<br />'EXCEPTION CLAUSE' in the 13th Amendment.<br /><br />13th Amendment Text<br /><br />Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\"<br /><br />I watched the opening scene and that was enough for me.  This is not a movie<br />about Lincoln, this is a propaganda movie about 'them' power over all others.<br />This is a racist movie.  There are so many racist undertones in this movie, it<br />is not worth watching.  This must be an R-rated for the violence and hypocrisy they are projecting onto our sense's.  Just a propaganda film to make you<br />believe that 'them' are all powerful and in charge of your life.  Much like Hitler<br />and his Nazi squads, but against whites and not Jews.
B00338QENI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much.  There was a lot of scientific information, but also an excellent story of the Lacks family, especially Henrietta's children and all that they went through following her death.
0307352153|5.0|I ordered this book after hearing about Susan Cain from a friend and listening to her TED talk.<br />She and her ideas are incredibly perceptive and enlightening. I wholeheartedly recommend her work.

B007HNFZOY|3.0|Bought the HD Amazon Instant Video.  Enjoyed the series and the show.  Characters were great, plot line is excellent.  That said, Amazon's Instant Video of this series does NOT have English subtitles, so please be aware if that feature is important to you.  For me, it's important enough to knock down two stars for an otherwise great series.  Please Amazon, make the subtitles available on your steaming video...

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book through the eyes of Charlie. The perspective he has on everything in the world really makes you think differently. I would recommend this book to any teen as well as anyone up for a good read.

B002VWNID6|1.0|Amazon has obviously been scammed, the reason this is a $5 copy is this is a crappy transfer.  The movie cuts off halfway through, and you have to flip the disc over to see the 2nd half.  There's no menu on the 2nd side, which leads me to believe this might not even be an official transfer.  No quality copy shuts off halfway through a conversation.  The cases are all stamped &#34;disc made in Mexico&#34; in small blue print on the plastic.  I didn't get around to watching it until it was too late to return it, otherwise I'd be clamoring for my $5 back.  If you like this movie, don't go for the cheapo copy of it.  You will not be pleased.

B000002OR4|4.0|I have only recently started listening to classical music i watched the movie Schindlers List and fell in love the music. The product arrived on time and worked perfectly.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This was the second and best time that I had seen Ringo Starr's All Star Band (my first was with Edgar Winter, Billy Squire, Colin Hay, and Gary Wright). Just four days before this one was filmed, I drove 250 miles to see this lineup in Tuscaloosa, so this serves as a quasi-souvenir of that show. My main reason for driving that far was that I am a big fan of Todd Rundgren and Greg Rolie, and was looking forward to seeing both of them on stage together with Steve Lukather of Toto to boot. Ringo's brother-in-law Joe Walsh did not show up in Alabama, but almost steals the show in this one.<br /><br />This was beautifully filmed and all of the musicians were having an absolute blast playing. This is the kind of DVD to be watched in a small party of long time friends and fans of The Beatles, Todd, Santana, and Toto. For me, the highlight is the Santana material with Steve Lukather on guitar. When Todd does Bang On The Drum All Day, notice that everyone is deliberately off key on vocals, because as Todd has said on previous tours, \\"Now for some foolishness\\". Enjoy this one!

B004TI5N38|3.0|This one was a good read but not as good as some of his others. Puller seemed pretty one-dimensional to me. I never did get what his brother did exactly. It was very pro-army, not that there is anything wrong with that. Puller just came off as some larger than life, super hero. Just not as believable as some of Baldacci's other characters.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was a little ify about weather to buy this movie or not, and boy am I happy I did, I'm not a die hard Lord of The Rings fan so it really doesn't bother me that not everything is gonna be in this DVD, like the special features or whatever it is that the fans are complaining about, which I think WB is being very unfair, but of course all they want is money, anyway, so this is kinda the first Lord of The Rings, I say kinda cause all it does is really explain how Bilbo gets the ring. The Hobbit is not actually a part of the Lord of the Rings; the storyline takes place earlier and is not intimately connected with LOTR, although the events in the Hobbit set up LOTR. it's nice to read it beforehand but not absolutely necessary. I really did enjoy everything about this film, I thought everything was perfect and beautifully done. It was action packed and it even had singing in it, but the script writers fit it in perfectly into the movie. I was literally at the edge of my seat.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. What a great story and was very hard to put down this book. I can't wait to see the movie and hope it is as good as this book.
B009XHAM8G|2.0|I bought this fully expecting to love it and be tearful by the end, but I found it a little weird. I am very sentimental about my son but I just don't feel like this book captured that, maybe because when I think of him I think of good things not the trouble he gets into. I probably will wait until he gets older to read this to him. There is another book with the same title that is illustrated with polar bears that is a lighter read for younger kids.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I loved all of Liane Moriarty's previous books, and was therefore very excited to find out that her latest novel was available for download from Amazon. It quickly solved my dilemma of the dreadfully difficult decision of which book on my looooooong tbr list to read next (maybe if I was as organised as Cecilia I would have a better system than the eeny-meeny-miny-mo method I usually employ, coupled with much nail-biting and doubt over my final decision). And The Husband's Secret did not disappoint - Moriarty's gift of making her characters almost real flesh-and-blood people, coupled with the offer of an unexpected roster day off from work, made for an intense read-a-thon which saw me finishing this book in a few hours of sheer reading bliss.<br /><br />From the premise of the novel to the very last detail of its execution The Husband's Secret had me totally in its grip and still causes some soul searching even now after the last page has been turned. What would you do if you found a letter written to you by your husband years ago, marked \\"to be opened in the event of my death\\"? Cecilia of course wants to do the right thing - she is the queen of proper decision-making (no eeny-meeny-miny-mo for her), and decides to ask her husband John-Paul about it first. His reaction is so baffling that for once Cecilia does give in to temptation - and opens the letter. Its contents are so startling, so mind-blowing that her life, and that of their three daughters, can never be the same again. No matter of organising, smoothing-over or patching-up will ever fix this mess, and for the first time in her life Cecilia finds herself totally out of her depth.<br /><br />Told in the third-person narrative, the book's chapters are written from the perspective of three different people, who are seemingly unconnected in the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />Tess, part owner and operator of a small advertising agency in Melbourne and mother of a six-year old son, has little idea of how her life is about to change when her husband and her cousin take her aside in the middle of her favourite TV show to confess that they have fallen in love. Feeling betrayed and heartbroken she takes her son and flees to Sydney under the guise of helping her mother cope after breaking her ankle. It is there that she runs into an ex-boyfriend she last saw when she was nineteen, and who is still very attracted to her.<br /><br />Rachel, who after twenty-eight years is still mourning the tragic death of her teenage daughter Janie, is having to face losing her beloved grandson when her son and daughter-in-law announce their planned move to New York. This decision, coupled with the imminent anniversary of Janie's death, brings back renewed feelings of loss and grief for Rachel, who contemplates a lonely life on her own in Sydney.<br /><br />Through Cecilia and the startling revelation in John-Paul's letter these three women's lives become intertwined in ways none of them could have imagined.<br /><br />I loved the premise of the book, the question of \\"what if\\" which seems to have become a popular theme in modern literature. Perhaps because every one of us at some stage in our lives will ask this question: \\"What if I had acted differently? How would my life have changed?\\" Moriarty answers this existential question perfectly in her epilogue, bringing together all the threads of the story and presenting a very satisfying finale - but enough said, there will be no spoilers from me.<br /><br />Inspired by real-life death-bed confessions, Moriarty's novel raises a lot of moral and ethical questions of what constitutes \\"the right thing\\". I may have been quite black-and-white in my answer prior to reading this novel, but vacillated constantly between different answers as several angles were explored. I may be a terrible decision maker, but in the face of such controversy, even the super organised Cecilia never stood a chance (of course she had a lot more to lose as well). And just when you may have thought that \\"the right thing\\" is pretty clear, the author challenges it with some startling revelations at the very end of the book. Amazing.<br /><br />What I also love about Moriarty's writing is the authenticity of her characters. All three main protagonists are the women-next-door, the mothers you see at the school gates, the members of your bookclub or the people standing in front of you in the supermarket queue. It brings the events unfolding even closer to home, thinking that this could happen to anyone, at any time. I had such vivid pictures in my mind of all characters involved that their personalities, their families and their homes seemed like I had seen them in real life. Perhaps the only thing I missed in this novel was the tongue-in-cheek humour found in \\"What Alice Forgot\\", which still makes it my favourite Moriarty book to-date.<br /><br />Apart from secrets kept and secrets exposed, marriage and motherhood feature as strongly in The Husband's Secret as in previous novels. As a mother, decisions no longer involve just a single person, but have grave outcomes on the people you love most.<br /><br />\\"You're a mother. You'd do anything for your children, just like I'd do anything for mine. \\"<br /><br />Would I, or wouldn't I? If it involved my own children, yes, I probably would. Regardless of moral and ethical dilemmas, like a lioness protecting her cub I wouldn't hesitate to defend my young. And this is where it becomes tricky of course.<br /><br />Enough said. I loved this book. I fully recommend it. Go and buy it and see for yourself.

B00A6RVRXG|5.0|Yo La Tengo has captured lightning in a bottle. They sound like a new band, having reinvented themselves solely by their own rules and history...There are plenty of recognizeable touchstones for long time fans, and yet, still...something is extremely different. One can't place it, except for the fact, it all sounds completely effortless, like not a muscle was flexed or brain troubled to find the illusive recipe for the perfect song. Because of this, &#34;Fade&#34; resembles YLT's &#34;Slanted and Enchanted&#34;....as good as any music genre gets, this is it - My very favorite Yo La Tengo album....that is saying alot, holding it up against my introduction &#34;Ride the Tiger&#34; oh so many years ago, or the bittersweet &#34;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One.&#34; &#34;Fade&#34; serves as the best bridge ever connecting this always great band to their past and present, and a very hopeful future.

B003JH8LPW|4.0|While reading this, I've caught myself holding my breath a lot of times, that I had to stop and make sure I don't get too tensed.  That's how edge-of-your-seat this high-tech thriller is.<br /><br />I like the way that the reader is not left guessing on all the techie aspects of the story.  Everything was well explained.  It's all about the complex and highly classified workings within the National Security Agency (NSA) and the threat to its own and the nation's security.<br /><br />The sorry truth that intellectuals are often duped by the simplest of logics is well presented in the story.  Often, in our fast-paced life, we overthink things.  However, we find that most of the time that the answer is actually very simple, very obvious.  That's my main takeaway from this novel - keep it simple.<br /><br />The ending (of the last chapter, not the epilogue) was trying to be cute.  It got me though, by just a little bit.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is by far my favorite! I like the new version also! I recommend this game to people of all ages
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I loved the book, but really did not care for certain things as they came to pass.  Do not want to give to much away, just thought some things would go another way and did not care for the way they did go.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I use this app very often I use it a lot for school work. I think it's easy and quick to use and I recommend it to other people
B009E9QOEO|5.0|I had seen the this show when it was being shown for a two day event in theaters and this was the reason I purchased the CD. The quality of Led Zeppelin sound has aged but not in such a way that one would say deterioration but a band that has evolved into a much more mature twist (not to say that the sound was immature). The CD still shows after their 1980's disbandment that their sound is still amazing even with material that has never been played live. I would also recommend the DVD or Blue Ray with the accompaniment a good sound system. Adios!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  The minions are adorable, and the movie as a whole is very entertaining.  A must see for young and old!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the variety this game allows. Waiting for more energy is annoying, but well worth it. I wish is was easier to earn diamonds, since I don't pay for anything extra in the game.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This has become my husbands favorite Disney movie!  We both love it, it has a great story line and we loved seeing all the old school video game characters in it; as well as the 8-bit animation.  This is a must see for video game lovers, but it also appeals to non gamers as well.  Overall great movie!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|It was a really good paced book... i hate it when books go around the bushes only in order to achieve more pages i guess... but truth be told, this was a great book which leave me wanting more, which is what a good book does, isn't?
0547848412|5.0|This is a great book. I saw the movie before I read the book which is quite the reverse for me.  I was a little worried that because the visual of the movie was so spectacular the book would not live up to my expectations.  No worry, if anything seeing the movie first made the book even more enjoyable to read.  The book is a little more graphic in describing some of the more brutal experiences of Pi but really put you more into his head and what he was thinking.  The author has a unique understanding of the relationship between human beings and animals as well as humans beings and their relationship to a power greater than themselves.  This book makes you think.<br />G
B00005UNCL|5.0|I bought this for 17.99 (It was 16.99 here with a 8 dollar 3d ticket voucher) and I got the blu ray, the dvd, the iTunes digital copy, I can get the UV digital copy and I got a voucher for 8 dollars toward the 3d release of Jurassic Park.  Also, watching its I see that the picture is great.  Even in the first scene on the beach i noticed more clarity with the tiny dinosaurs (compies).  The picture and the cgi stands tall in comparison to present digital competitors.  The disosaurs really look real, have been polished well, and i thought it was great to have juianne moore in this movie.  She is a great actress.  This movie of course was not as good as the first, as the first one showed what this movie does for the first time and had a better story, but it was still a very good movie.  I remember in the theatre - the part in the train with the glass cracking was way too much suspense!  A must have blu ray.  If your question is whether or not to upgrade, I could see an improvement in the picture and sound immediately.  Also, getting the movie, the 3d ticket voucher and the iTunes -and- uv digital copy is hands down a bomb deal.  So if you go see Jurassic park 3D, you basically just paid ten dollars for this movie combo pack.  (That 3d voucher us only offered for a couple weeks if you are reading this way later) I give this an A+.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Would prefer actual moving radar pics. The options of additional locations to monitor vacation, home etc is nice. Not bad.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Probably expected more since it was nominated for so many awards, but found it a little slow.  Great attention to detail to the historical period.  I thought Ben Affleck's character was almost too underplayed and stoic--it was a little hard to sympathize with him.  Always love Alan Arkin and he added a lot of flair to the movie.  Good suspense movie (even though you know the outcome!)
B000EQHHJW|5.0|Excellent recording.  Of course no one can surpass Luciano Pavarotti or Verdi in my mind.  I enjoyed the fact that the Opera was filmed in Italy which made it even better.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Bloody excellent,as are all of Martin's books. A captivating tale with so many twists and turns that you'll never figure what's round the next bend. Definitely worth the read.
0451232852|5.0|Ken Follett is a compelling writer who knows how to mix fiction with fact.  It was hard to put the book down.  His fictional characters were interesting individuals whose stories you wanted to know more about.  The book itself was a reminder of all the horrible things that went on during World War I.  I can hardly wait to read Winter of the World.
B002WY65W4|4.0|Packaging and shipping were great. If you are anything like me, the movie will make you laugh and it is very quotable. Also, while I personally dislike twinkies, the homage to the once abannoned (havent tried the new ones yet) apocalyptic snack cake is worth the low price of admission.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Packaged nicely.  Arrived in a timely matter. There is nothing else you can do to a John Waters film.  Its already gold.

0446530573|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and his girlfriend.  We have used many of the recipes and have enjoyed all of them.  The marsala recipe is my favorite -- with chicken or veal.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I read many books and often devour them. This book was a real chore -- it was so Boring with all the political details -- would continue the trilogy but would only want to know about the characters and that would take about a dozen pages -- this book droned on and on and on and on...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I found it to be a good summary of the events as I previously understood them prior to reading the book.  I also watched Zero Dark Thirty this past weekend and I was glad I read the book prior to the movie.  I enjoyed them both.

0739366408|4.0|The oral reading made this book so much more entertaining. I actually read the book before listening to the audio version. It was dry and I lost interest. The oral presentation was a hit.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|What can I say about the quality of Disney animation? The product is in excellent condition and my grandaughters both love it!
B0068RHSCW|3.0|Not a great movie, not a bad movie. Good story. Rachel Weisz is gorgeous as usual, and Daniel Craig is very sexy... as always! it is worth to see this movie on a saturday night with friends and lots of popcorn.

The cupcakes - such as prize winning Black Forest or Strawberry Champagne - are all hors concours! The prize winning carrot cake is outstanding! So moist and delicious! I got a bunch of fans when I made it. All my family and friends called asking me for the recipe! I highly recommend this book if you want to take your baking skills to another level of excellence.

B000I9U9A4|4.0|If you like the Aubrey-Maturin tales add half a star. The action on the sailing ships (which is where this film takes place) is very life- like and  makes you feel like you are back in time and have landed on the deck of the frigate Surprise.

1400153786|4.0|This review is for the audio book (on CDs) format. Amazon does not have a separate review section for the different formats of this title. If you are considering listening to the audio CD format, be aware that Richard Dawkins and his wife Lalla Ward alternate reading the text. They both enunciate clearly and read smoothly, and at a good pace (that is not to fast, nor too slow). The audio production quality is also well done. It is possible to do other tasks while listening and still be able to hear clearly and comprehend what is being said/read. The cadences of their voices makes the reading engaging (which is another reason I was able to multi-task while listening). Some readers speak in monotones, or they mumble, or do not enunciate clearly. And that makes an audio book tedious to listen to and therefore distracting. However, the reading of this audio book is satisfying. Regardless whether the listener agrees or disagrees with the textual material, the audio book is well produced and definitely a format worth considering if you don't have time to sit down with the printed book. Also, for someone unacquainted with Richard Dawkins' views, this title might be an appropriate starting place. He presents his ideas but does not go into great depth. After hearing this audio book, if a person is interested in more of the author's views, the reader can explore them in other books.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 really gives Temple Run a run for its money! (Haha) The environment is different, there are more Bonuses and when you die you can come back to life with Gems. I would give this a 4 and a half.

B005K17RU0|3.0|Slow to load and move between screens. The description for the map overlays are difficult to follow. All in all avarage.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing! The only downside is how long it took to get an English translated one stateside. It has everything a book of this nature should have in it, and then some. Aside from the awesome Zelda timeline (which goes way in depth about the splitting time lines and goes to explain what each installment means to the overall Zelda universe) this book has Character drawings from storyboard to finish models to unused models for every game! It also has a Zelda manga based off of Skyward Sword in the back!
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|This book was so inspirational that you would want try some of the ideas in here even before you finish reading it. Anyone who has an idea that needs to be heard and remembered should read it. It's also extremely readable with a mountain of colorful anecdotes scattered throughout the book. I am moving on to the authors' next book, SWITCH, a book about making change.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|You only come across a CD that is great all the way through instead of just a couple good songs here and there.  This is one of those that is great all the way through.
B009KHCLIS|1.0|Never been more disappointed with Amazon. I'm trying to catch up on episodes before live episodes come on the TV. I had a short window to watch 3 episodes and I only got through 1 because this POS system would not process and there was an error. Now my &#34;purchase&#34; which doesn't require a human to do anything is &#34;pending&#34; and I'm going to miss the live episode.<br /><br />Could not be more upset with an already outrageously expensive product.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|Ugly Betty is in my top five of all-time best comedy shows. America Ferrera is amazing, and the supporting cast is brilliant and fantastic. Entertaining, very very funny, and great fashion... What more could one want? If you're looking for hours of amazing comedy, there are four seasons of ecstatic comedy in store for you... If you haven't seen Ugly Betty, start with season 1, you won't want to miss a blessed second of the great jokes, comedic artistry, or compelling story. The ending, though sad to reach, since I could have watched Ugly Betty for many more seasons, was superbly fitting, and showed our Betty had grown-up to reach her great potential. Such a joyride...
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This production was first rate.  I thought the acting was particularly compelling and believable.  Daniel Day-Lewis certainly deserved the best actor oscar for this performance.  Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones were also excellent.  You felt as though you had stepped back into the time of Lincoln.<br /><br />Our one disappointment was that there were no closed captions.  Is this standard for your Amazon movies?  If so, it will affect how often we rent.
B009IF7092|5.0|I have never laughed so hard, felt so joyful, or marveled at such excellence, in a comedy before. The actors are comedic geniuses. Their timing is impeccable, their delivery perfect. You can't help but LOVE them. This is comedy at its finest. The writers are marvelously innovative and creative, and even the simplest slapstick comedic moments will become epic cultural phenomena. The only other show that even comes close to touching it is Seinfeld. Big Bang is just pure funny through and through, and endearing beyond belief. I live for this show. I own all the seasons and re-watch often. This show is hands-down the most hilarious comedy ever written. Long live The Big Bang Theory.

B00B1CGD5M|3.0|For the most part, the album doesn't really grab me... Partly that's stylistic: a little too much of the metalcore stuff going on, but also, it seems really repetitive or at least monotonic. Track 3, This Momentary Bliss made me think that maybe the first two uninspiring songs would be the exception, but I was wrong. The rest of the album was mostly forgettable, proving that #3 really was just a moment of bliss that would pass into a sonic void of boredom. That said, I'm sure their headlining set at Prog Power USA will be enjoyable because of the energy they seem to be bringing and the quality of their older material, which hopefully will be liberally mixed in to their setlist.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Good graphics perfect 4 kids! I really love it. My two younger cousins love it and want to play it
B003EYVXXW|4.0|This is a good movie that could have been great were it not for two major flaws. Since I think there's much of value here I'll focus on what the film did right before getting to what it did wrong.<br /><br />First off, and most obviously, comes the sets and costumes. The sets here are truly amazing. This film's Alexandria is possibly the most realistic portrayal of an ancient city on film. It's run down, populous, and colorful. The costumes are likewise realistic using a much heavier cloth than we're used to seeing in film. When this is combined with some excellent cinematography and visual themes (including a recurring satellite view) it makes for a visually stunning film. I don't know how they did this on such a small budget but it stands proudly as one of the most beautiful historical dramas put to film.<br /><br />The second thing I loved about this movie is simply it's choice of time and subject. The Roman Empire seems to end with the death of Commodus judging from Hollywood productions. It's very nice to see a film that takes place in Rome's final century. The choice of philosophers for a theme is also excellent. Rachel Weisz makes a wonderful Hypatia and the scenes with her working to understand the nature of the universe are the best in the film. In fact, if the film had consisted entirely of this plot line it'd have been simply perfect. The love of knowledge and culture really comes through in a big way. They pay strict attention to what science was known at the time and how it was taught, and although they do have some rather implausible speculation about what she knew it manages to make it seem believable.<br /><br />Now we get to the problems. First and most obvious is the fact that the film is basically several films in one. And you can take that in several ways. To deal with the most obvious example the film tells a complete narrative that ends around the halfway point only to start up again several decades later. You can also see two separate movies within the plot. One half is Hypatia's quest to understand the physical world, the other is based around the rise of Christianity. Both of these plots are intertwined throughout the film but they are never interconnected. The two stories happen in pretty much complete isolation to each other, particularly in the second half. The Christian scenes are boring too and every scene not dealing with Hypatia seems like a distraction. Really, the film needed to pick one of these themes and make them the subtext because they do not combine well together.<br /><br />Secondly the film has some terrible character choices. Hypatia herself is great, her father likewise, and the prefect Orestes alternates between being great and incomprehensible. The real problem comes in the slave character Davus, who is madly in love with Hypatia and so turns to Christianity to get some relief. The slave in love with his master is about as tired a plot as you can get in Roman films and the way they do it doesn't help here. Hypatia's part in it is quite good revealing a sheer indifference that was hidden beneath her earlier compassion, but Davus' part in the story generally feels phony and tacked on. The ending in particular is unspectacular and out of the blue. The Christian characters in general are without nuance or personality except for fanaticism. The only exception to this is her former student who has some positive qualities. In general it is the reduction of all Christian characters to crude stereotypes that is annoying. The various debates of the period have been simplified into religious conflicts with extremely simplified issues. For example the whole issue with Cyrus wasn't about whether pagans could still have a role in the city (they would continue to do so for over a century) but a power struggle between a prefect and a bishop. Whether the changes made are fair or not they make the film uninteresting. While I do get what he's saying about religious fundamentalism he could have doneso more interestingly and more subtly if it had been the subtext of the film and not part of a joint focus.<br /><br />I have other minor complaints about the film from a historical angle, such as the fact that Hypatia is presented as secular when in fact she was a pagan, but none of them take away from the fun of it. I just wish that all the Hypatia scenes could be excised from the religious fundamentalist scenes and put into a movie of their own. Honestly, Hypatia isn't even driving the plot in her own film. At no point does she have any influence on outside events.<br /><br />If you're interested in other films from the same period in history there is a miniseries on [[ASIN:B00007AJF4 Attila]], a [[ASIN:B004PRT08M movie]] on Attila, and a pretty poor [[ASIN:B002KOIDLC peplum]] based on the life of Constantine. There is also the series [[ASIN:B000GY8Z2K Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of An Empire]] which has an episode on Constantine and one on the fall of Rome.

B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Absolutely loved this. The extra 8 minutes of film were amazing, although I don't understand why they couldn't be kept in the original film. As many times as I have seen this film at the movies ( 33 times!! ), it never gets old and I loved every minute of this amazing saga.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this app seeing I  under the name Mojang. It is totally worth $6.99. You can survive with monsters such as creepers, zombies, spiders, and skeletons or simply play on peaceful mode. You also have Creative mode were you can build almost anything. This isn't' exactly better than the P.C version but they update minecraft pocket edition every few months, so if you are playing it and I  doesn't work I suggest that you wait until the next day until it fully updates. If you cannot get it to work then  I suggest to remove it

0553386794|3.0|It seems as if everyone has heard of Game of Thrones. The HBO adaptation of George R.R. Martin's books has become a popular and critical favorite. I must admit I was hesitant about the series, and after watching the pilot I still was not convinced. However, a few episodes in, and I was completely hooked. Unfortunately, TV seasons take a great deal of time to create, promote, air, etc. so I had to start reading the books in order to satisfy my own curiosity (Reading is such a hardship for me, I'm sure you understand my pain).<br /><br />This book started off much the same way as the TV series did for me, slowly. The world-building and character introductions can become rather tedious, but by the end, it pays off greatly. The story may start slowly, and for the first half of the book much of the action is based around political intrigue and verbal spars. However, as the political climate moves toward war, the stakes rise for each and every character.<br /><br />There are certainly many fabulous characters in this series. There are those to hate (Joffrey! I need him to die), to love (Arya, Tyrion, and Daenerys top this list for me), to admire (Ned, despite his faults), and to despise (Littlefinger!!). The list of characters that populate this series is enormous, and it is quite daunting as you begin. As the stories continue to weave together though, it becomes easy to keep track of the characters and become absorbed in their tales.<br /><br />I had read previously that the initial season of HBO's Game of Thrones was remarkably faithful to Martin's book, and I definitely agree. Certainly, there are differences. The most obvious being the changing of many characters' ages, but considering some of the content, this was very necessary for the network. I have seen many adaptations, and I would rank this as one of the best (Note: this is strictly a comparison of A Song of Fire & Ice / Game of Thrones and season 1 of Game of Thrones. I've heard the second season is not quite as faithful).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a fascinating, entertaining start to what promises to be an unforgettable series. Martin manages to weave together the lives of an amazing number of individual characters, and he has also created a world which fantasy fans are sure to marvel at. I would highly recommend A Song of Fire & Ice and HBO's Game of Thrones, although there is certainly material that is only appropriate for mature audiences.as faithful).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a fascinating, entertaining start to what promises to be an unforgettable series.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|FLIGHT is a great, dramatic film. I'm not here to tear it apart. And I've studied film and acting for many years and worked in production since 1992. Denzel never disapppoints. And hopefully some of the people who worked on this movie will understand where I am coming from here. Regarding John Goodman's character in this film... It is sad to think that the producers feel Goodman \\"brings\\" something special to the production here. John Goodman's role is very much like Phillip Seymour Hoffman's annoying character in TWISTER and Goodman's own role in BIG LIEBOWSKI, they seem to think that his vulgar language and attitude puts some special \\"character\\" icing on the cake here. It was not needed at all. It sucked. He's not a great actor, just a personality. No hard feelings Mr. Goodman. And why do men of director Robert Zemeckis' age, like Scorsese, feel they have to use these classic Rolling Stones songs that we have fresh in our minds from films like GOODFELLAS. Use some other tunes people!!! Introducing John Goodman's character with the Stone's \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" song was predictable and not very original at all. But the movie is solid and everything else about is also. Of course the had to put Don Cheadle in it as a black lawyer right??? Actor Geoffrey Wright would have been a hell of a lot better choice for his presence. Let's re-shoot this movie!!! Brett in Florida.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Honestly one of the greatest stories ever told with the best characters and amazing casting. I still cry over the canceled show, but find so much joy in watching the series over and over and dreaming about where the characters could have gone.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Well written for the layman and understandable.  Some of the newest theories are too far out for me to grasp, but at least they're trying!  I do wish he'd leave his personal views on theology for others to explore in an appropriate way.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|What makes this adventure fantasy so great is that it still seems to be a secret to many people. This movie is right up there with my favorite mix of genres. You get everything! Adventure, romance, fantasy, and tons of comedic moments to treasure! If you love movies like The Mummy and Willow, then this is a MUST SEE!
0393343405|2.0|I was planning on wrting my own critique, but having now read Mark Skinner's superb Amazon review, I can only add a few addendums to that remarkable effort.<br /><br />Greenblatt's ostensible thesis is that the world transformed itself and became modern  when it learned to stop believing in God and start believing in itself.It did this when Lucretius' 1st century B.C. \\"De Rerum Natura\\" was rediscovered and \\"saved\\" in 1417 by a humanist book hunter,  Poggio, who was rumaging through old monasteries in Germany looking for ancient manuscripts.<br /><br />PAIN TRIUMPHS OVER PLEASURE. What was the medieval world like before this transformation? Greenblatt(\\"G\\") argues that early Christianity hated the \\"core ethical idea\\" that the highest good is the pursuit of pleasure and the diminution of pain. Pleasure to the Christians, he says, was at best a demonic trap, figured in medieval art by alluring women whose gowns concealed cruel claws. Early Christians had to reverse this commonsensical view so that Christians avoided pleasure and sought pain. It took centuries to accomplish this \\"grand design\\", he argues, but ultimately the church was successful.<br /><br />ATOMS AND A MECHANISTIC VIEW OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS. Lucretius' 1st century B.C. \\"De Rerum Natura\\"  argues that \\"everything\\" is made of invisible particles that he called indestructible \\"seeds.\\" Though he does not call them \\"atoms,\\" clearly that is what Lucretius is referring to. Between these atoms, Lucretius argues, there must be \\"voids,\\" and he goes on to give reasonable arguments as to how air and gases can flow and metals be molded. These mechanistic explanations as to how the world works fits well with modern science.<br /><br />WHY GREENBLATT'S 'TRANSITION TO MODERNITY' THEORY IS ABSURD ALMOST ON ITS FACE.<br />Democritus and Leucippus, more than 400 years before Lucretius, first espounded the \\"atom\\" based mechanistic theory of how the universe works. This is the true beginning of modern science. Both of thesewriters were well known in Italy by the early 15th century. Also, nearly all of Aristotle's works on \\"natural philosophy\\" had  reached western thinkers by this time, albeit indirectly through Muslim Spain and having had to have been translated from the Arabic. It is true that Lucretius added the valuable concept of \\"voids,\\" but essentially all the elements of the \\"Western\\" way of science were already in place - and available - when Poggio brought back his manuscripts from Germany. G mentions Galileo, Newton and Einstein but does not prove that any of them read, let alone relied on, Lucretius for their own scientific success.<br /><br />LIKEWISE, LUCRETIOUS' VIEWS ON RELIGION, ON THE ABSENCE OF A SOUL OR AN AFTERLIFE, ARE NOT ORIGINAL AND COULD NOT THEREFORE HAVE CHANGED MANY MINDS.<br />Protagoras and other pre-Socratics doubted the existence of the traditional gods and reserved judgment on whether there were any gods at all. Socrates at an earlier time in his life, scholars believe, was a \\"natural philosopher,\\" openly denying the existence of the gods. All this is set forth in Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds,\\" where Socrates measures \\"fleas' feet\\" and generally gives naturalistic explanations for such things as lightning and rain. Later, in his famous \\"second sailing\\" he turns away from the study of  the physical world and becomes quite spiritual. In the Phaedo, he says: \\"But I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence, and that good souls have a better portion than the evil.\\"  All these classical sources were available to 15th century Italians, so it is unlikely that Lucretius' poem changed any minds.<br /><br />BAD, MISLEADING AND MISTAKEN HISTORY.<br /><br />a. G minimizes the influence of  the \\"Renaissance.\\" While there are scholars who emphasize that there were continuities in Europe  pre and post Petrarch - that it was not night vs. day - the balance of scholarly opinion, I would submit, is to call Petrarch a true catalyst. It was he who created modern Italian from the Tuscan dialect. According to Prof. Kenneth Bartlett, it was Petrarch's fervor, and that of his followers, who created a particular \\"mind-set,\\" a collection of powerful attitudes and beliefs. There may be some truth to G's assertion that Petrarch's approach was \\"tendentious,self-congratulatory exaggeration,\\" but so what? The Italian historian Chabod calls the Renaissance an \\"energizing myth.\\" By which he means that Italians became convinced that they could do anything...so they did!<br /><br />b. G calls Florence at the time Poggio left it \\"conservative and socially bounded.\\" This is simply absurd. Florence was a republic and was run in a semi- democratic way by its powerful guilds; it had physically expelled most of the nobility in 1115 for excessive fighting; because of its banks and woolen trade it became the richest city in the world at the time. A humanistic education system took hold emphasizing  a very  pure Latin, some Greek and the study of most of the pagan classics. Humanist educators required that some selected poor boys be educated along with the elite so the latter would not feel too superior. It is estimated that more than 5% ofthe male population at the time could read and write good Latin. And 1% Greek! A sense of civic humanism developed wherein citizens came to believe that they should contribute their wealth and talent to their city's betterment. At the time, Florence was the least conservative or socially bounded city in the world.<br /><br />c. G's depiction of Lorenzo Valla is deliberately distorted, incomplete and unfair. Valla, though an ordained PRIEST(!) was also a Latin scholar who taught at several universities.  He is most famous for his proof - through forensic philology - that the \\"Donation of Constantine\\" was a forgery. This document purported to be gift by Emperor Constantine in the 5th century of temporal powers over Italy to all future popes. Hired by the Court of Aragon, who had a territorial dispute with the pope, Valla proved (ultimately) to the satisfaction of all, that this was an 9th century forgery. Further, this fearless priest also 1. proved a forgery of a supposed letter of Christ; 2. Wrote \\"De Elegantiis\\" and over papal resistance  criticized the Vulgate bible (the only one in use at the time) and sought to purge Latin of post-Classical accretions; and 3. published \\"De Voluptate\\" ( \\"On Pleasure\\") which openly admitted his sympathies for the Epicurian vs the stoic philosophy! It would have been nice if G had told us that a priest was advocating pleasure over pain, contrary to what he erroneously argues was the position of the Church.<br /><br />AN ANTI-RELIGIOUS POLEMIC... A SALVO IN THE CULTURE WARS; THAT, SADLY, IS WHAT WON THIS BOOK THE PULITZER PRIZE. THE FANS OF SAM HARRIS, RICHARD DAWKINS AND CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS ARE THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Greenblatt doesn't say this openly, but it clearly can be discerned from his unsupported prose. A few examples:<br /><br />\\"What was ridiculous about Christianity, from the perspective of a cultivated pagan, was not only its language-- the crude style of the Gospels' Greek...\\"<br /><br />\\"...the Incarnation and the resurrection of the body seemed absurd--\\" figments of diseased imagination,\\" as one pagan put it, \\"and the futile fairy-tales invented by poets' fancy\\"...<br /><br />\\"Such enemies of faith found the doctrine of bodily resurrection particularly risible, since it was contradicted both by their scientific theory of atoms and by the evidence of their own senses..\\"<br /><br />\\"Some critics pointed out with a derisory smile that many features of the Christian vision were stolen from much more ancient pagan stories..\\"( How does G know that critics had such a derisory smile?)<br /><br />G praises \\"Utopia,\\" the 16th century English book by Thomas More as being in every way Epicurian and liberal... EXCEPTin that it failed to deny  a providential God and an afterlife. And, G tells us, \\"The denial of Providence and the denial of the afterlife were the twin pillars of Lucretius' whole poem.\\" Here it is: the heart of Lucretius' philosophy, according to G, is atheism.  More's Utopia had \\"imaginatively\\" embraced De rerum natura, but had \\"carefully cut its heart out.\\"<br /><br />Finally, while though G acknowledges that Sir Issac Newton was deeply religious, he has to add: \\"In England, as elsewhere in Europe, it had proved possible, though quite difficult, to retain a belief in God as the creator>\\"The inference is unmistakable that G feels that in our modern age it is impossible for an intelligent person to retain that belief.

0857685570|5.0|Recently I pre-screened a documentary called \\"Drew: The Man Behind the Posters.&#34 (available on DVD through Amazon). It is about Drew Struzan and it prompted me to order this book from Amazon. My hope is that the documentary will be included as a selection for the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival so many more fans will understand the story behind this brilliant talent. Through it, we get to know this wonderful man and understand how he became the originator of the iconic art you see in this terrific book. I expect an increased demand for \\"Drew Struzan: Oeuvre\\" as time goes by. At least I certainly HOPE so!    Post Script: Sorry, this was NOT selected by SIFF but I am distributing my own promo for this through JayFlix.net. So THERE!

B000OXHRRC|3.0|Certain movies stick with me for music, scenery or simply because I can't get them out of my head.  After watching this movie twice a few years ago it popped into my head because I like the feel of it.  I can put it on in the background on a winter day and clean my house and escape to another little paradise and think about when I lived in Europe.  There is nothing particularly great about the acting but it has a little comedy and I love that.
B0037NVM1I|1.0|First the HD movie loaded in standard mode and after it stopped and reloaded 20 min into the movie it loaded in HD.  Then every few minutes it disconnected again and I finally gave up.  I hope this is not indicative of your entire program.

1476719071|5.0|I always feel like I need to defend this book with so many people I know hating it this much. Beautiful Disaster is The Book that made me love bad boys and angsty romance. This book is like 50 shades for me. The same way I fell in love with eroticas adult books after reading 50 shades is the same way I became a die hard fan of new adult genre just by reading Beautiful Disaster. Yes, there were some scenes that made me question the difference between being over-protective and acting like a total stalker, but when I look at the story as a whole, there is something very captivating about Beautiful Disaster that you couldn't help but be entertained by it, in the least.<br /><br />  Abby is a good girl. Travis is a bad boy/ sex on the stick. Now that is the perfect combination of an emotionally frustrating yet equally entertaining and sexy romance. I liked Abby instantly simply because she didn't caved in for Travis's charm and set him straight. Even after she started dating Travis, she didn't think twice before leaving him if he did something terrible, which he did because he was one messed up character. I admire Abby for that. As for Travis, I don't think I've ever read about a person who is so unstable in his life, from the outside he seems perfect but we get to know the real Travis when he is with Abby. He is obsessed with her to the point I felt awkward being in Abby's position but what made me love Travis was his determination. He never gave up on her and improved throughout the book. I loved seeing him with his family and getting to know how close he is to his brothers. It's the little things about Travis that made me fall head-over heels in love with him.<br /><br />  Beautiful Disaster is not a book for everyone. If you can't handle hot & cold characters, then look for something else. Jamie McGuire wrote a brilliant yet risque book about an abnormal yet normal relationship. One moment I wanted Abby & Travis to have a happy ending and the next moment I wanted to murder both of them. My emotions were all over the place with this one and I've never read anything like this. It's different and I love it! Highly recommended to all the fans of angsty romance.murder both of them. My emotions were all over the place with this one and I've never read anything like this.

B0028IDXDS|3.0|I was under the impression that the monkey would be like a beanie baby... meaning heavier. It's really light and all the baby needs to do is move an arm and it pulls the pacifier out of her mouth. Also, the pacifier is permanently attached to the monkey which makes washing it difficult - either the monkey or the pacifier when it falls on the ground.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great story, great characters, fascinating time period. Hard to believe this was happening a mere 100 years ago. Watched it once for the story and again for all the background details - costumes, accents, subtle gestures and comments.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My daughter really likes this mobile. It has beautiful colors, pleasant animals to look at and a remote so you can start and stop it from a distance so the baby doesn't see you -- especially as she's falling asleep. So far no problems, but it does feel kind of bulky and heavy so I have a piece of string that ties the top to the back of the crib railing. Somehow I didn't feel safe leaving it just hanging over my baby the way it is made - that's why the 4 stars.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I knew from the description this relationship would be a train wreck. You know that it's horrifying  but you just can't look away. This is Abby and Travis all day.  My first impression of this book is \\"Wow, these are two screwed up people!\\". Seriously.  This book had me thinking back to the bad boys from my freshman year of college....BUT lucky me, I am NOT Abby and I surely never dated my own version of Travis! Even though this book is coined as a \\"romance\\", this book does not depict what a healthy relationship it.  Period. So with that said, take this book with a grain of salt.<br /><br />These two are really unbelievable, and not in a good way.  All of the reasons they should not be together are exactly the same reasons why they belong with each other. They totally deserve each other.  Abby has serious daddy issues and she was a child card shark! Growing up around hustlers and gangsters  she definitely has a colorful past that has left her wanting to have the polar opposite for her future.  When she went away to school, that was her chance to reinvent herself and Travis totally threw a wrench in her plans.<br /><br />I liked the there wasn't any of  the dreaded \\"instalove\\", you know, when two fall head over heals in love upon their first encounter then they are all over each other for the whole book?  Well, it's actually there, but it's so low key that you don't notice it right away. You can tell they both like each other, but they fight it. And I wouldn't call it \\"love at first sight\\", more like \\"lust at first sight\\", which turned into love after they got to know each other.<br /><br />I also appreciated that the author added a more reasonable sounding best friend for Abby. America has looked out for Abby even when it seemed like it was unwarranted and really she should stay out of the craziness. I guess old habits are hard to break, when your defending your friend for so long, it comes naturally.  It was cute to see the relationship between America and Travis's cousin, Shep.  They added a little bit of sanity throughout the crazy up and downs of Travis and Abby.<br /><br />Overall, I sort of liked Travis, even though he is severely flawed.  I kept waiting for him to cross the line of no return and he never did. thank goodness. He's a really violent guy, and that quality unnerves a lot of women, it would absolutely bother me. I do wonder if he'd ever get mad enough to get into a physical fight with Abby.  There was one scene where he swore he would never hurt her, but I do wonder.  He needs therapy. I almost think Travis would become that crazy stalker if Abby ever left him for good. But that wouldn't happen because Abby loves crazy and that is why they will probably be together forever.  Hell, Abby needs therapy too. Maybe they should go together.<br /><br />Beyond Travis's extreme talents of being insecure, feelings of being not good enough, untrusting toward Abby and others, if he could, he would control everything the girl does. But again, if Abby likes it, we all love it. Because only a certain type of person would be comfortable with that kind of behavior from their significant other.,<br /><br />This was a fast and easy read.  Sort of predictable, but still entertaining.  I look forward to reading how this whole relationship develops from Travis's point of view in the next book, Walking Disaster. I bet he makes Abby seem like the more crazy one!cousin, Shep.

B003KLGKAA|3.0|Catherine Tate played Donna Noble great as a doctor's companion and it was awesome seeing her return, but with David Tennant wanting to leave, the doctor's story had gotten weird and the way the writers wrote Donna Noble's departure was a-w-f-u-l!!!!!<br /><br />Yucko!!! The fun entertaining 10th Doctor turns into a majorly whiney, pathetic, moping, annoying character! Regenerate already!!!!<br /><br />Ok, I don't like that David Tennant wanted to leave, even though many fans (including myself) didn't want him to leave, but the writing turned the 10th doctor into a very unlikable as mentioned above character. I and others were glad he left ~ cheering it on during this episode!!!<br /><br />I don't particularly like that David Tennant now keeps trying to edge in on the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith's brilliant performance! Yea David, you were great at first, but you went out like a stink bomb, stop raining on Matt Smith's well deserved parade!!!!

He still looked ancient. And....the movie is too long.

This is the case with Eric Ries’ The Lean Startup. I highly agree with his message of smartly navigating a new product in the hi-tech market. Many companies launch excellent products but fall flat on their faces because of misguided management. Even more absurd is that management doesn’t even listen to their customers nor do they act probably when their customers show discontent.  This book is an overly explained cook book for managers or team leaders on how to launch a new product from a startup or from an established company. With an emphasis on listening to your customer and changing direction to accommodate them, each step Eric recommends makes sense and should be executed. He even believes a product should be launched earlier amongst a controlled environment in order to learn from them and make the proper adjustments so not to waste money launching an end product no one would be interested in. The examples he uses are more focused on software applications and SaaS (Software as a Service).<br /><br />I did not agree with two points in his book. First, for such a long winded book, he barely talks about the threat of competition. If a company launches a service or product very early into the market, the competition can jump on it and totally take advantage. He claims that the company would have a head start but I do not agree. Once you expose your product, you can not predict what the competition will do.  I think he should have taken the competition more into consideration. Second, I think his theory is weak when applying to hardware products. Hardware does not have that kind of quick fix flexibility and he does not mention this obstacle.<br /><br />Even though I gave it three stars, I do believe this book should be read. The messages are good. I recommend that a company assigns one individual to read the book and then summarize it in a PowerPoint presentation of no more than an hour (1.5 at max).  This book will not last the test of time. There is no universal brilliance in it like in Geoffrey Moore’s Crossing the Chasm. It will become obsolete very soon so you might as well read it now.e individual to read the book and then summarize it in a PowerPoint presentation of no more than an hour (1.5 at max).

B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Living with this illness myself, I found \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" a reasonably accurate representation of the inside of Bi-Polar Disorder.  It is not romanticized but, rather, looked at \\"full scope\\" with affects on not only the protagonist with the disorder but upon family and friends.  The roots of the pathology is shown clearly through the father's obsessions and emotions, played authentically, sensitively and well by Robert DeNiro.  The inside jokes of the BPD couple are so familiar and the edge upon which those with BPD reside excellently portrayed.<br /><br />I would recommend this film not for an easy viewing or a heartwarming touch but for the as-accurate-as-Hollywood-can-get-it picture of what it is like to live with Bi-Polar Disorder.  There are many living with this illness everyday - I, for one, felt a kinship and some comfort with this film.  Our brains maybe wired differently and sometimes destructively, but there is creativity and love amidst it all.  For that representation, I am deeply appreciative to \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\".

0735204314|5.0|One of the best books I've read on the subject (and I've read a lot). This is a book for people who want to use the subconscious mind for a better life. Its a easy read and will get you results quickly. It lays out how the subconscious mind works and how to use it to get the results you want in any area of your life. It's simple and it works! Do yourself a favor and read it. I have bought a few and given them to my friends who are not into psychology. You won't get a phd but you will get results. Not psychobabble, not fluff, not filler. 100% pure beef.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. I can't get enough of it. It would have five stars from me, except for the following things. Sometimes it glitches when I am trying to play Kung fun scary game. Also, the last update (for Easter) said you could get some Easter type items in the shop, but it was never made available to me. I have a kindle fire...don't know if that was the difference but it would have been nice to not have been teased for something not made available for my game. I even checked back several times and it still did not work. Please don't tease me if it will not be available to me. Especially since I play this game so much and have put so much into it. Other then that, it is very cute...Especially with the new dino world update. It would also be nice if every time I wanted to visit friends villages, I would not have to add them all over again. The game has been dropping the friends every day. Can get a little frustrating. Still would recommend, though.

B00C0OZT9Q|1.0|My wife and I found the premise very intriguing but were very disappointed when within 4 episodes there were 3 scenes about rape and 1 scene about group sex. We thought it was a safe bet because of who produced the show but it seems that that method of measuring whats going to be clean and whats not is not very dependable. The story was ok but the continuous themes of distasteful and detestable content was too much for us.

There was too much cursing and not enough good music and lyrics that i could just sit back and vibe to. Definitely a  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

Reacher fans have a mental image of what he looks like and how he acts and it sure wasn't Tom. Not his fault. Miscast end. Just my opinion. I'll stick to reading about Reacher:)
0062082353|5.0|It's a shame this book's author is no longer with us. I would have loved to meet him in person. A true American who did not put himself on a pedestal. He wrote a very moving book about his life as a seal and what he did and why he did it. A lot of solders and marines came home alive because of his ( and the other team members) dedication to God and duty. As a retired sailor I have so much respect for someone who gave so much and made such a difference for his comrades and the other military who were fighting. I think this should be required reading for those who aspire to command. If I was still active I would require it for recommendation for promotion.
B001PBEJL4|5.0|My husband and I could not stop watching this outstanding movie  although it is 3 hours!  The Blue-ray made the entire movie look beautiful.  The actors Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero were outstanding actors and made us feel happy and sad - Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave had a beautiful marriage in the beginning so we felt sad later because of the adultery of Queen Guenevere and Franco Nero.  Richard and Vanessa both sang beautifully.  All of the music was touching.  We enjoyed listening to the CD music in our car.  What a treat!  We received our movie in just 3 days, especially since we live in Honolulu. Aloha, Mrs. Nathalie Hee

B007W7P5L8|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle because the one I had previously blocked the edges of my screen and hindered playing some games.  This one clips onto my Fire on the ends and the screen is completely uncovered while keeping it securely in the cover. The elastic strip keeps the cover closed when not in use and works great.  The non-skid interior works well as a stand.  The front cover has two different textures - a smooth side and a sort of striped texture.  The smooth side also covers the back and is a slightly pearly version of the purple.  This case does exactly what I wanted it to do and I love it!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Simple controls but challenging. The chase levels are pretty difficult to complete. Only way to know if this is for you is to give it a try. I tend to like puzzle games and I do.
0307887448|1.0|I am astounded by the lack of negative reviews about this book. I can only assume it is because all of us who found the book so poorly written could not finish it, and so didn't feel as if they had a right to review it. I stopped half way through because of cliche plot points and terribly unoriginal dialogue. After hearing others praise it over and over, I decided I would finish it so I could give the entire book a fair chance before I wrote it off as an nostalgic circle jerk. I can only compare the fan boys to the twilight fans who must be so enthralled with the 80s references that they cant see the lazy writing, and young-teen section story arc that drives this terrible book. To all you out there who read this book and agree with me, review it. It hurts to see this book sitting on the same tier as &#34;a song of Ice and Fire&#34;
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|What a story!  The most amazing part is that it is true and this writer actually lived through the nightmare of WWII.  It is as good as &#34;Those Who Save Us&#34;, another true account of a female living through the holocaust.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|This movie reminded me of Goonies only with a really horrifying (misunderstood) monster.  The characters, the young actors played, drew you in to their plight and you were just as anixous to find out what was going on as they were.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|One of the better albums put out this year, I was very pleased and impressed by Dark Roots of Earth.  Skolnick is back, much less restrained than he was on the last effort, The Formation of Damnation, and REALLY dazzles.  The band sounds great, tight and have a real nice thick heavy sound on this record, with a bit of attitude to boot.  &#34;Native Blood&#34; and &#34;True American Hate&#34; are immediate standouts, but I was also sucked in by a cover version of...(drum roll)  &#34;Animal Magnetism&#34; by the Scorpions.  Yeah, I was surprised, too!  But pleasantly so!  They rocked that tune...  The album (for me, anyway) &#34;dies down&#34; during tracks 7, 8 and 9, which are STILL GOOD, just not as AMAZING as the ones that preceed them.  But there are SEVERAL cover tunes at the end that I enjoy and pick it back up.  Chuck seems to really be back, and it is super great to see (and hear!).  Probably the best metal album of 2012, with the exception of Overkill's &#34;The Electric Age&#34;, which is amazing.  (Ironically, they went on tour together supporting their respective albums!)  Will take THIS any day over the new-fangled metal nonsense coming out these days.  These men still know how to do it RIGHT.
B005LAII62|4.0|My children love it but it doesn't get a lot of play as the other stop-motion animation movies we have like Coraline, James and the Giant Peach, or the Nightmare before Christmas.  The killing of the little girl accused of being a witch is also a bit harsh, even though it was a reality for such times.

B00A83075M|5.0|We love the video game aspect, cute story line, and for us adults, the old school game characters in the movie.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I don't usually rate movies based upon their technical prowess or success at the box office, but rather on the emotional impact they have upon me. That is the aim of all great art. As such, I am shocked that this movie has received negative reviews. I can certainly see how people might be disappointed if they watched \\"Lincoln\\" for the mere entertainment value, but I suspect that was never Spielberg's aim with this one. All I'll say in defense of this movie is that it made me tearful on occasion. Admittedly some of that was because of the scope of the accomplishment of Abraham Lincoln himself, but at least some credit is due to Daniel Day Lewis' stunning performance. Within the first ten minutes of the movie, I had already forgotten that I was watching an actor in a role. All throughout the movie, Sally Field, however great, was Sally Field playing a role. Daniel Day Lewis was so amazing that you had to remind yourself you were not watching Abraham Lincoln himself. That alone would merit the acclaim \\"Lincoln\\" has received. Beyond that, and the historical perspective such a movie will necessarily have to be placed within, the movie can admittedly be slow moving at times. But that is only a problem for the viewer with ADD or the astoundingly short attention span of the contemporary American movie goer. All I know is that as the credits rolled, I felt like I had watched a truly great movie. In the end, that's all I ever really need to know.

0316187216|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, so much so that I'd probably consider it my favorite book I've read so far this year. I'm not sure I liked it quite as much as the original First Law Trilogy, but I think that this is my favorite of the standalone books from Joe Abercrombie. I loved the setting inspired classic Westerns, especially since it's in the First Law world with multiple returning characters. Perhaps because of it being a Spaghetti Western Fantasy Adventure Novel, there really isn't anything magical or fantastical in Red Country, other than a very brief cameo from a Wizard that I believe was in one of the previous stories. In fact, this book could probably be placed in the Western section, if it wasn't for the presence of swords instead of bowie knives, cross-bows instead of six-shooters, and the fact that it takes place in a secondary world, not the western United States. This book is instead driven by the wonderful original characters, excellent writing, and the rather simple but heart wrenching powerful story. I really only had two problems with Red Country, the first is just the basic formatting, where for some reason in his books all of the quotes only have one apostrophe instead of the normal two. It really took me awhile to get used to it, and until then the flow of my reading was effected, especially with some of the vernacular using apostrophes and having some of the viewpoint character's thoughts following right after someone else's comment. My other problem with the book isn't exactly a problem as it leads to some of my favorite scenes in the book, but in a fantasy book that's more realistic/gritty, the extreme amount of coincidences that fuel the story and interactions are a bit problematic. I'd say that it almost borders on being driving solely by Fate or Prophecy, even though that doesn't seem to be part of the story/world-building. I just found that the way everything falls perfectly into the place (sometimes horribly) at exactly the right momentto be a little odd, and it occasionally took me a little out of the story, it also made some of the outcomes of the story slightly predictable.<br /><br />If you look solely at Red Country, the world building is very slim. This is great for the long-term reader/fan of Abercrombie's books as there isn't any retread as the author tries to provide an info-dump to attempt to catch every reader up (new and old), but it's also great for a new reader as there really isn't anything they would need to know other than what's outlined at the beginning of the book. Basically, the western part of the continent is starting to be repopulated, partly by settlers looking for a new life, but mostly by people betting their lives on finding gold along with other people waiting to prey on them. Things are further complicated by the presence of savages (Indians) unhappy with the incursion of civilization and the two super-powers of the world (The Union and the Empire) hoping to lay claim on this fertile newish land. There are multiple main characters with interweaving stories, but the main driving storyline is initiated by the rampant kidnapping of children and the murder of anyone else that gets in their way. The child thieves happen to steal the wrong pair of children, as their older sister and step-father (whose pasts are riddled with bloodshed) will stubbornly follow them to the ends of the earth. This part of the story, especially near the beginning, is immensely powerful as they follow the bloody trail of the kidnappers, cleaning up the messes they made by burying all of the bodies they find, praying that the next body they turn around won't be one of their kids. After a bit, they group up with a wagon trail, and the story slows down a bit, but I still really loved the section as it evolved the characters and really increased the Western feel of the story. The other storyline in Red Country focuses on a mercenary company that's been sent by the Union to oust all of hiding rebels and bring the territory under Union control. Sadly, whenever you throw a couple hundred blood thirsty warriors at a problem, it tends to end in bloodshed along with rampant pillaging. The time with the mercenaries was entertaining, but it wasn't as good as the main story, however it does introduce an excellent and completely original viewpoint character in the Merc Company's Lawyer/Jack-of-all-trades. I won't go into any more depth in regards to the story to avoid spoilers, but I will say that I loved it, and while the ending is far from perfect it was still very enjoyable and expertly crafted.<br /><br />The writing in this book is superb, and I really don't have anything to complain about. The flow of the writing is great, with the book being a real page turner, although occasionally an expertly written scene or line would break me out of the flow where I was forced take time to recognize its majesty. There are a few odd choices made with the name of the characters though. I won't describe who exactly I'm talking about as it would be a spoiler, but there are a few returning characters whose true names are never spoken. Some of them are smaller, and this caused me to not exactly remember them, but another is huge, and even when who he is was made abundantly clear, it was odd that his name was never actually said. By the way, for anyone that had previously read Abercrombie's books but wasn't sure about picking up Red Country, the presence of this awesome character is enough by itself to warrant a purchase and read-through of the book. The action here is very well written, but it was a bit odd that none of the main viewpoint characters were really the heroes/fighters in the story; I mean they still take part in the battles but it's usually in more of a secondary capacity. Abercrombie does a really interesting thing every once in a while, where for an important event there will be multiple rotating viewpoints to get different angles/opinions on the unfolding event. It could be a little jarring since for most of the book the reader is riding along with one character per chapter and there aren't many main viewpoints, but I still really enjoyed the change in pace this writing tactic created. Those viewpoint characters are amazingly original and well written, and the only other author that I've seen come close to having such completely different characters (especially if you include Abercrombie's previous books) is George R.R. Martin. The voice really feels completely different between the characters, and to me they have to be so unlike the author that I find it amazing that he can make them so real and believable.<br /><br />So overall, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that likes to read, whether they're fantasy fans or are new to the genre, whether they've read the previous books from Joe Abercrombie or are new to his masterpieces. I will say that if you've read his previous books, you will get a lot more out of Red Country, but it just improves the reading experience, and I don't think it would harm the quality of the story for a new reader. It may also provide an interesting experience if the reader goes back and starts the First Law Trilogy, as they can see younger versions of some of the characters in action. I simply loved reading this book, so much so that I was kind of sad when I was done, especially since I know it could potentially be awhile before I can read a new book in this world.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck acts as Tony Mendez a CIA agent who is instrumental in helping six Americans escape from Iran in 1980. In a volatile Iran, Iranian youths have stormed the American embassy compound, six embassy officials have secretly escaped and are hiding at the American ambassador's house, all they need is a plan to escape Iran. In the film,  we are witness to one of the most dramatic escape operations in the history of espionage, this was a relatively closed chapter until the Clinton Administration declassified the CIA operation. Ben Affleck who made his directorial effort worthy of the Oscars instantly becomes a worthy successor to Clint Eastwood as one of the most years.successful actor turned directors in years.<br /><br />Argo is a tight well written and acted drama about a CIA operative who must hatch a plan to smuggle out the Americans that is believable to the fanatical revolutionaries. In order to gain access to Iran and credibility with the fanatics, Mendez uses his hollywood contacts with the help of Lester Siegel, a film producer and John Chambers, a makeup artist to create a fake science fiction film production. A production that will certainly seem believable, so a fake science fiction film is concocted with the name Argo.<br /><br />Argo creates tension at the right places and is evenly paced. Even though the story of the film plot is ridiculous, the CIA had no trouble fooling the Iranians. The acting is great thanks to a great cast comprising John Goodman, Alan Arkin and Bryan Cranston. five stars 3/28/2013

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Skyfall came without much fanfare but has become essential viewing for  many Bond film lovers. We have the familiarity of a Bond film but Sam Mendes infuses it with enough fun to make it a stand alone thriller.<br /><br />We have Bond in a rut struggling with middle age and substance abuse. However he is rejuvenated through the film and luckily for us he rises up to the challenge.<br /><br />Then we have the mandatory  villain and this it is Silva ( Javier Bardem) who does not make an appearance until halfway through the film. In Skyfall it is Silva, a cyber terrorist who has stolen a list of undercover agents and is planning on blowing their cover. To retrieve this chip we have Bond enduring a brilliantly shot chase scene on the streets of Istanbul.<br /><br />A Bond film would be no fun without the exotic locations and this one does not disappoint, I thought this was one of the most visually rich of any Bond film in recent times, from the gambling den in Macau, to the glass tower with its floating Jelly fish, the island in South China to the countryside in Scotland, this is a beautiful film to look at.<br /><br />Javier Bardem as Silva is amazing and another reason to watch the film. He appears very late in the film but once he appears it is difficult to keep your eyes off him even in the presence of beautiful Bond girls such as S&eacute;v&eacute;rine (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe) and Miss MoneyPenny ( Naomie Harris). However in Skyfall, Bond does not have much time for women except M who is played by Judi Dench. Together Bond and Miss M have a lot of issues to resolve ......with her cold looks she tells Bond that \\" Orphans make the best agents\\"<br />This is a good film and a great Bond film in a long time,to paraphrase Adele, \\"Hold your breath and count to ten, this is not the end\\". .........five stars. 3/23/13

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The picture quality on this latest restoration of Lawrence of Arabia is amazing.  This is a great movie and this restoration preserves the detail and color of the large format original while removing all jitter and blemishes. I have the earlier restoration on DVD and this Blu-ray is far superior in picture quality plus it contains a new interview with Peter O'Toole.<br /><br />This great movie now has a Blu-ray worthy of this classic historical adventure..

I would support the comment from another reviewer, that his description of his travels were interesting, but felt the same time to me as bragging. Overall a nice read for inbetween.

B002PDBA90|4.0|I wouldn't consider this an essential Porcupine Tree album, but for fans of Steven Wilson's early music circa Up the Downstairs/The Sky Moves Sideways it's an important piece in his exploration of Pink Floyd-styled pysch rock. The reissue feels a tad padded out by using remixes of parts I and II to fill two additional &#34;album sides&#34;, but the entire package nonetheless scratches that psych rock itch like nobody but early Porky Tree can.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game but how do I update...I dont see a button or anything...I don't know what to click because I dont see<br />a buttuon
B002NUZ93S|5.0|In its original form Steven Wilson had all the right pieces in place for this album -- great songs and remarkable soundscapes that make for an amazing sonic journey. But the reissue is even better. He's replaced the original electronic drums with Gavin Harrison's superb stick work, plus there have been a few other noticeable tweaks, most notably the bass/drum groove to &#34;Not Beautiful Anymore&#34;. To my ears the reissue is a noticeable upgrade over the original, and it ranks with Signify as my favorite of early Porky Tree outings.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a well-written and superbly executed story.  Maggie Smith's performance is believable, witty, and  charming, made more so by self-deprecating humor about her arch-conservatism.  Preserving the social order and status quo of times-past, and being at odds with the changing, threatening values of modernity, loom large thematically in the story.<br /><br />Whether typical or not of early 20th century England, the family of aristocrats occupying Downton Abbey show kindness and concern and fairness & a sense of obligation toward their servants, even if & when they're occasionally unkind and snotty among themselves.<br /><br />The story often turns at moments of crisis and tragedy.  Having run for three seasons, the season's story-ending is often a cliff-hanger.  It is enjoyable television viewing!
B0090SI460|5.0|We enjoyed this movie when we first saw it, had to buy the 3D version when we got a nice 3D TV.  It's well worth the money, this movie is great, very entertaining!  It's for adults as well as kids, we're almost 60, but still really enjoyed it.

B00003CX9E|1.0|This is seriously the most overrated piece of rubbish ever to have hit the screens. SO what if he used different angles, so what if he used different lighting. The fact os that the script is pooh, the acting dire, the direction awful and as a whole it just doesn't work. The only reason it gets acclaim is due to fawning fannies fellating Orsen Wells' early career. I will never get those hours back and I am furious with my tutor that I was made to watch it for my film studies. If it did one thing for me, it showed me how a film should not be made.

B00BN3ECTS|2.0|\\"There is more than one way to skin a cat\\" has got to be humorously posted on a some wall somewhere within the offices of Nicholas Sparks Productions.  The latest proof of this has arrived in the form of Safe Haven.<br /><br />In Safe Haven, Katie (Julianne Hough) is introduced frantically attempting to escape being chased down by a Boston Police Officer (David Lyons).  The mystery of the film revolves around why this chase is taking place, but of course the point of this film revolves around her somehow ending up in North Carolina with a handsome man.  \\"Write about where you know\\" has got to be humorously posted on some wall in Nicholas Sparks's North Carolina home.<br /><br />Katie does end up in the aforementioned state in the tiny town of Sea Port.  Sea Port offers all of the necessities for Sparks to work his magic: quiet streams for canoeing, beaches with virtually no one around, general stores, rusticity, no technology, one big event (that apparently draws over 100,000 people in for a day), and a laissez faire attitude.  Predictability ensues, but not to an offensive degree.<br /><br />This is the eighth Sparks novel to get the cinematic treatment, but it may as well be the eightieth.  It rarely rises above standard TV movie production quality and offers nothing unexpected to the viewers.  What it can cash in on is the likability and chemistry between its main co-stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.  I suspect that this is the main reason the film got green-lit at all.  An attempt, albeit a failed one, at adding some edge accomplishes little more than The Lucky One was able to accomplish last year.  What is surprising is that the novel does have some edgy back-story, but director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m and screenwriter Dana Stevens chose to downplay, simplify, and blatantly avoid these opportunities preventing this film from elevating itself above the standard warmed over genre-film that it became.  Formulas exist because they provide the framework for pleasing an audience, but unfortunately they grow tremendously stale and unsatisfying if they are not tweaked and modified from time to time.  This is a lazy movie from start to finish, and it is an apparent Valentine's Day cash-grab at a movie hungry audience looking for a romantic film during a barren movie season.  Like most films that receive reviews like this, it will be very comforting to those who go in knowing what to expect and unappealing to everyone else.  How do you grade a film like this?

B008JFUNAU|3.0|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a triumph in entertainment longevity. Since L. Frank Baum's novel was published in 1900, the story has found relevance in the lives of generations of fans and has undergone countless reimaginings from page to stage to its most recent screen makeover, Sam Raimi's Oz the Great and Powerful.  Oz is Disney's second notable big budget update on a classic children's tale after 2010′s Alice in Wonderland, and the comparisons are numerous, which may or may not excite you.<br /><br />Like Alice, Oz is somewhat of a frame story where the first act takes place in the real world, and a set of circumstances launches the main character into a magical new world.  James Franco plays Oz, a traveling carnival illusionist with lofty goals but little ambition to put in the effort to reach them.  Franco does well as Oz.  His early scenes depicting Oz's sleazy ethics and immoral ways with women ring true of a young Woody Allen.  This neurotic zeal and ironic self-confidence is very entertaining and it is some of the film's best material.  However, Raimi does not waste his time getting Oz to...well, Oz.  Oz is transported to the Land of Oz by way of a fortuitous tornado, a way of transportation clearly not uncommon to early 20th century Kansas.<br /><br />The Land of Oz looks  great and there are some incredible details woven into its fabric, and with a visionary director like Sam Raimi, this is to be expected.  However, the film does lose some of its freshness upon its shift to Oz.  The film is actually at its best when it is developing Oz's character at the beginning.  Once the film actually moves to the Land of Oz, it gets a bit convoluted.  The Land of Oz is being terrorized by a wicked witch, and far too much time is wasted pretending that the audience doesn't know which of the film's three witches is the bad one.  Eventually Oz allies himself with Glinda (Michelle Williams) against Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz).  Weisz is especially effective and it is unfortunate that at some point down the line, we know a house is going to land on her.  To add to the already bloated storyline, Oz also befriends a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and an orphaned enchanted china doll (Joey King), both of whom refer to characters and events set up in the film's opening act. As the film goes on, it certainly begins to fizzle, but it is not without its charm and is incredibly respectful of the reputation Oz's legacy has established.<br /><br />A well-known film critic gave a favorable review to Oz the Great and Powerful partially because he said it, \\"does not rest or fall back on formula.\\"  This is a movie that begins in a real-world setting (in black and white), magically transforms to brilliant color upon the main character landing in a fantasy world where he then meets three odd \\"friends in need\\" who all team up to defeat a wicked witch.  What part of this is not formulaic?  Additionally, what part of this is not 2010's Alice in Wonderland?  It's not that the film is a bad film, but let's be honest - we've seen this before.  What Oz has going for it is visual charm, a good story, and a feel-good tone; all of this working to create an effective movie experience.  Oz the Great and Powerful was released in both 3-D and IMAX and it is The People's Critic's recommendation that it be seen in 2-D, but in IMAX if possible.  The 3-D is not worth the surcharge since most of its effect is gimmick based, although the kids will get a kick out of the flying arrows or the water being spit at the screen.  IMAX screens, on the other hand, definitely enhance the fullness of the world that Raimi and everyone else \\"behind the curtain\\" created.

B005LAIHVI|4.0|The story of Jack and his magical beanstalk dates back to Viking times and over the past 1400 years, we have yet to be sick of it.  Countless versions of this story exist in virtually every format of entertainment imaginable.  The story is a good one though and in the hands of the talented director Bryan Singer, this version is certainly one of the best.<br /><br />Jack the Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult whose star is on the rise.  Fresh off of his other starring role as R in Warm Bodies, Hoult functions well as the underestimated, romantic hero.  The main story is mostly familiar.  Jack is trusted with a task to sell items for money, but he returns home with no money and a handful of \\"magic beans.\\"  The magical properties of the beans are unleashed when they become wet in a rainstorm sending Jack's house, and inadvertently the King's daughter Isabelle, up to a legendary land of giants via a massive beanstalk.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) organizes a team to rescue his daughter lead by his trusted knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and including Jack as well as the plotting Roderick (Stanley Tucci) who the princess has been promised to for marriage.<br /><br />The giants are truly spectacular.  They are easily 20 feet tall and have a very clever form of motivation based on a previous war between man and giant, which resulted in them being magically enslaved by a magic crown.  Nonetheless, they are vengeful and dangerous, bringing a real threat of danger and excitement to the story.  Furthermore, Singer allows several opportunities for tongue-in-cheek humor to permeate the already clever adventure story that takes place up the beanstalk.  Simply put, a strong case is made for Stanley Tucci to have a part in every movie.<br /><br />The only issue the film has going against it lies in its first act.  Singer's film begins a bit slowly with terse voice-over narration of parallel backstories for young Jack and young Isabelle.  The children playing these parts deliver excruciatingly clich&eacute;d performances, and it was at this point that I admit I was worried.<br /><br />Consequently, I must pause here to mention that this review comes with a brief stipulation.  When it comes to re-making a fairy-tale, there are many pitfalls that can occur; a major one is choosing the right audience.  Aside from this tepid opening segment, Bryan Singer actually has made a film that would exist more comfortably in Middle Earth than in Disney World.  It embraces its world of man-eating giants and has fun with it.  This decision certainly enhances the film's entertainment value, but it also takes a familiar children's tale and puts it just out of reach for children to enjoy. Creating an opening scene so clearly not in congruence with the rest of the film sets the incorrect initial mood that is hard to shake once the movie gets good.  However, if you can make the leap, this film definitely functions much better as a romantic action film than as a cute and safe children's tale.<br /><br />That being said, I liked Jack the Giant Slayer.  I also recommend seeing it in 3-D, which is a recommendation I can honestly say I would give to no more than five films.  This is a fun, entertaining, funny, and good looking film that is easy to enjoy once the film figures out what it is and who it's aimed at.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is a movie that you hate to love.  It is without a doubt one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, largely because the events it depicts were so grotesquely barbaric, yet historically accurate.  The story of Oscar Schindler, who morphed from war profiteer to a rescuer of hundreds of Polish Jews destined for extinction, is told simply and calmly.  The events the film chronicles illustrate how perverse a tyrant and his minions can become unless society remains vigilant in standing against them.<br />The cast and script execute director Steven Spielberg's vision brilliantly, and the epilogue illustrates not only the magnitude of the horror that European Jews faced under Hitler's boot, but the profound significance of Schindler's contribution to their survival.<br />Spielberg has provided us with a history lesson that should be told and retold every few years, lest we forget the potential for tyranny in society.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|My whole family loves Phantom of the Opera.  This sequel, while not quite as good as the original, was still a really engaging story.  The actors were great, and it was amazing what they could do with such a small stage.  The music was fantastic as Andrew's music always is, but there were a few points where the performers vocal range was not quite as dynamic as I would have liked.  This did not take away from the performance though.<br /><br />All in all well worth watching, and an enjoyable addition to my collection of musicals.

B00BF11STU|1.0|...This would be it.<br /><br />I have to admit my review isn't the most comprehensive - I could only take about half an hour of it before I turned it off. Basically, after the third or fourth scene of Our Hero beating up on The Naughty Brown Foreigner (but not liking it), I wanted to barf so bad that there wasn't any point in continuing.<br /><br />If you're stoked to shout HoorAH merKA! and have a self-aggrandizing chuckle over Our Heroes smiting the Evil Foreigners, the other two hours of this movie will probably be almost as epically satisfying as Mein Kampf was for nationalistic Germans. Knock yourself out.<br /><br />Favorite quote:<br />\\"Say it! Say you love freedom!\\"... (To the grimacing Maiden): \\"I know it's hard to watch, but we have to do this to save innocent lives. I know, I know, terrorism has its roots in poverty, and Union Carbide killed thrice as many people in Bhopal as died in WTC, and OBL hasn't been an active leader for years.

When the teenage daughter, mildly astonished by his peculiar (to say the least)  appearance and behavior asks him, &#34;Are you stoned or something?&#34; Depp responds with just the perfect hint of pride, saying, &#34;They tried stoning me, my dear.&#34;  A smile breaks his cadaverous face as he explains,  &#34;It did not work.&#34;  And the love scene between Depp and the jilted but exotically gorgeous, Eva Green, is hilariously &#34;off the wall!&#34;  If you haven't seen it, do so. But beware, my dear, ... you will want to see it again.

B00028U6B8|2.0|This has a couple of good songs - you know the one - and the rest is BAD 60's trippin' music!! JA could be the 2nd most over-rated group in history (after The Grateful Dread). Just get \\"Worst of JA\\" and that is all you will ever need!

B0000C23DO|1.0|This CD has 1 (ONE!!) good song - Truckin' - the rest is total garbage just like 99.9% of the drug-induced, space-headed so called music that comes from this amateurish, over-rated, over-hyped sucky band.  Never should have made it out of Amateur Night at the Holiday Inn.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington did a GREAT JOB in &#34;Flight&#34;. I have watched over and over again. The sound effects were &#34;GREAT&#34;.
0783240236|5.0|A classic!  The extra material that was included about the actors and the filming are definitely worth the time to watch them.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The case does exactly what it was advertised to do.  It protects my Kindle Fire from scratches, sunlight, and the weight of things that happen to get stacked on top of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is so much to do and there is two different modes survival and creative, survival mode is for people who like to take a challenge and creative mode is for beginners who want to know more about where minerals are in the world or people that just want to create what's on their mind so if you want to do any of that then I definitely think that this game is for you.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The reviews were ecstatic. I do not think this is a classic in the making, but it is a story well-written, depicting an interesting, sad and dark world.
B005U9REU0|1.0|I ordered this movie based on the reviews but have to say they are WAY WAY off. This was up there with Underdog in the &#34;painful to watch&#34; category. My kids were the first ones to say it was bad and they are 8 and 12. Really lame. Poor acting, really bad story line, goofy characters and dorky special effects. Makes you feel embarrassed for the actors if only they were. I would say it is at the level of a Sesame Street clip with similarly deficient acting and characters -  except that most of them are way too ugly/scary for a child of this age. All I could deduce is that the many people who gave it good reviews must be David Bowie groupies, since he stars as the villain.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We loved catching up with the shows we missed. Good Winter time TV time with my honey. Nice pacakage for storage.  We'll probably buy the 3rd season now
0553382179|5.0|This book is SO helpful, well organized, kind in its writings and will help you get on top of your clutter and finally discover you WON'T have to be the next episode of HOARDERS - BURIED ALIVE.  There are really great instructions, step by (baby) step ways to improve your domestic skills with clear direction of where to start, how to tackle the issue, room, pile of dishes, etc.  I keep going back to it again and again.  so YES, THIS is the book you want if you need to tackle the army of dust bunnies under your bed or clear out a room that was once a guest bedroom and is now a huge dump  - to dump stuff.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool. It is my favorite game yet. The graphics are the best. My favorite part is creative mode because you can build anything you can imagine. And survival mode you can go to the nether.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|brought this for my boyfriend and we both loved it until he started wearing it and the closure kept comming off.

B0086HGW42|5.0|I bought this album on a whim because I was really liking A Team (on the radio like all the time). I really wish they'd play some of his other stuff on the radio because I know a few people who won't bother with listening to him because they're sick of hearing A Team all the time -- his other stuff is great too, sometimes even better imho.<br /><br />The album gets even more beautiful every time I listen to it. I love the way he can make the weirdest phrases sound absolutely perfect sometimes. He's got sweet songwriting skills (in addition to being an awesome singer too of course). Buy this album and you will not regret it. Seriously. He rocks.
B000L212HC|5.0|What can I say, this movie is one of the greatest as far as I'm concerned. I mean what a line up. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine,  the ever amazing Scarlett Johansson (whew....) AND David Bowie as Nikola Tesla!?! EPIC as all blankity!!!!!

B005LAII62|3.0|Norman Babcock (voice by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old boy living in a New England town Blithe Hollow, who loves watching horror movies. And he can speak with the dead. Well, he feels more comfortable speaking with them, as those around Norman, including his own father, just don't understand him.<br /><br />One day, Norman's estranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (voice by John Goodman) shows up before him, telling him something about the curse put on the town of Blithe Hollow.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" is a classic case of style over substance. The stop-motion animation of Laika, studio that gave us \\"Coraline\\" in 2009, is certainly unique in blending the beautiful and grotesque, with some witty horror spoof and low-key humor, but it sometimes seems storytelling and character development are tossed aside. In short, the character of Norman is not very interesting. Supporting characters are not so much individuals as types.<br /><br />This is not to say that \\"ParaNorman\\" is a dull movie, but given the attractive visuals and enormous efforts to create them, the film deserves a more compelling drama.
B0086213XW|4.0|Nice movie. Relationships were not as believable as I would have liked,  but the story definitely has a message. Michelle Williams is interesting to watch...took me a little while to recognize how striking she is.

B00AAQHP66|5.0|I saw this film with a friend (who is also a teacher) at the theater, and we both loved it.  It is one of the most inspiring and motivational stories I've ever had the pleasure to watch on screen, and it's based on the real life story of Jay Moriarity.  The California surf and coastline make for some beautiful cinematography in the film, and the 90's era music compliments the film action.  Gerard Butler and Jonny Weston really make the main characters come to life, and the supporting cast does a good job as well, especially Abigail Spencer. I have recommended the film to other teachers; everyone who saw the film came back with positive comments, and some even watched it a second time...it's that good!<br /><br />I bought the film as soon as it was released on DVD.  I teach 8th grade English, and I have shown this film to all of my classes as a motivational tool.  They loved it, and many of them want to buy the film.  They also have asked me to show the film again.  The main character, Jay Moriarity, is a great role model for anyone, but especially kids, and there is nothing offensive in the film; it's rated PG.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an inspirational motivational film to show to students, or for a family movie night.
B006K1C0MO|5.0|Wow, I am just amazed at how heavy and yet still musical this band sounds. Great musicianship, great production, and most importantly GREAT headbanging make for an easy 5-star metal album.

B0091REZMW|3.0|not really into time games but it was free so I tried it. was definitely pleasantly surprised. I actually liked it
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|FINALLY they officially released this on DVD. 1988's \\"Maiden England\\" show captures Iron Maiden hitting another peak, seeing as how the corresponding album, \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" did really well for the most part, and the shows they played were massive. The show itself is of good quality in terms of video and audio quality, especially considering how old the video really is. And the editing, allthough done by Steve Harris (bless him), DOESN'T show you a full show worth of rapidly changing 1-second clips, which is a huge plus. As a bonus, I dare say the setlist is killer. 6 out of the 8 songs found on \\"Seventh Son\\" are featured, and in addition to the old hits and live staples, you get a few rarities as well, namely \\"Still Life\\", \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" and \\"Killers\\". NO Powerslave songs were featured, though, but with \\"Live After Death\\" in your arsenal (where it should be), it's allright. Oh, for the record, some people have commented on Dickinson's vocal performance - the guy had recently had the flu as far as I remember! He still sounds pretty good to me, though (if you wanna hear what he's like when he's REALLY got a bad case of the flu, there are a few 1986 bootlegs available on youtube).<br /><br />As for the 2nd disc, I must say I'm a bit disappointed, but before I explain why, I wanna stress that it's still good, and DEFINITELY worth having. Now, onto the whining:<br /><br />1 - The documentary, part 3 of the \\"History\\" series, is only 40 minutes long despite covering 2 excellent studio albums and their corresponding tours. This is a popular, yet also rarely discussed era of the band, and while you get interesting anecdotes and details from the guys, the whole story seems a whole lot more rushed than in the previous 2 parts, which I think is a shame. Speaking of \\"rushed\\", good LORD, the editing and putting it all together seems rushed. It's clearly a different person behind this one, and he/she seems to be on a mission to make your eyes explode. Thewhole \\"let's surround the main object with a messy collage of old photos and live footage\\" approached may have worked well for the video for \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\", but for a 40 minute documentary it drives you crazy. There's a TON of things going on at once. Also, between these shots, there are other photos, often shown at rapid speeds, with distracting backgrounds and fancy effects put on for NO obvious reason. Plus, they only interview the 5 bandmembers who were involved, as well as manager Rod Smallwood. The earlier installments have featured input from other people involved with the band at the time, so that you get to see more sides of the story. In short, I definitely feel this installment is inferior to the other 2 in both quality and content, but like I mentioned above, it's still worth having, there's no doubt about that.<br /><br />2 - Is it just me or are the promo videos featured on here of lower quality than at least those on the \\"Live After Death\\" bonus disc?<br /><br />3 - Okay, so they do a brand new 40 minute documentary, but still include the 90 minute 1987 documentary \\"12 Wasted Years\\", a retrospective that mostly overlaps the \\"History\\" releases? Now, to be fair, you do get to see a few things that are left out of the \\"History\\" installments, namely a few rare live clips and Paul Di'Anno with a mullet. But I'd gladly replace this outdated documentary with a longer, more complete \\"History\\" documentary and.. well, see point 4.<br /><br />4 - Since they included the awesome - albeit very rough - footage of the Ruskin Arms show on the first \\"History\\"-dvd... Why not include WHATEVER decently shot material available from the \\"Somewhere in Time\\" tours, which many fans are dying to see, even though it may not be of the best quality? In the documentary, Rod Smallwood says they've \\"got bits of\\" the show, and they  agree it was a good show! I mean, the 1987 Philadelphia concert was filmed by multiple cameras, and some of the songs are of decent quality, maybe that could've been used?<br /><br />To sum up, the first disc alone makes this purchase worth the money, because it's brilliant, and the 2nd disc is allright, I just feel it could be better. It looks like it's been put together rather quickly, to be honest. But others may disagree, and in any case, my humble subjective opinions still won't prevent me from recommending this purchase to fans and Maiden rookies. Don't hesitate to buy it!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Dracula has a baby girl that he just adores and he promised his dead wife that he would protect her from the evil humans.  He has gone to great lengths to build a safe environment for her and only surround her with their monster friends.  She is coming of age so quickly and it is time to let her experience the world, after all she is 118 years old.....<br /><br />This is a cute movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  My grandson loved it and so did we.  The computer generated animation is top notch and storyline is cute and funny.  There is a lot of action in the film and it makes it entertaining and the time goes quickly.  This is a cartoon that children and adults can enjoy.  It features a long list of monsters that are done into comedic roles that give the film a funny twist.<br /><br />The movie does have a PG rating and the only thing that I saw was that Dracula gave several loud and vicious snarls into the camera that may frighten little children. They were a little unsuspected and it could be intimidating to young children.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|An unusual film \\"Hitchcock\\" is a bit of biography, a bit of a \\"making of\\" and quite a bit of fiction surrounding the Hitchcock's classic 1960 film \\"Psycho\\". If taken with a grain of salt, \\"Hitchcock\\" is an enjoyable mixture of fact and fiction that hinges on the performances of Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife (and uncredited collaborator) Alma and Danny Huston as Whitfield Cook a writer who worked with the Hitch's during the 1940's. All three give great performances and Hopkins focuses less on imitating Hitchcock and more on developing his character as he begins to see serial killer Ed Gein while preparing and shooting \\"Psycho\\".<br /><br />The introduction of an affair that Alma may or may not have had with Cook (those events supposedly occurred in the late early 50's nearly a decade before \\"Psycho\\" as Cook was working on \\"Strage Fright\\" and \\"Strangers on a Train\\"). According to Hitchcock biographer Patrick McGillian Cook may have been gay (based on information obtained from his journals--Cook reportedly was involved with Sumner Elliot much later in life).<br /><br />Even if \\"Hitchcock\\" is far from factual, it manages to be an enjoyable romp.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer from Fox. Colors pop and detail is extremely sharp.<br /><br />The audio is quite good as well and is provided in English, Spanish, French with subtitles in English and Spanish<br /><br />Fans who pick this up for the DVD should be aware that none of the special features are included on the DVD included in the Blu-ray combo pack.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has some nice special features including: a deleted Scene, a variety of featurettes focusing on \\"Hitch and Alma\\", Danny Elfman (who provides a very good score that compliments the Herrmann bits and pieces included from \\"Psyho\\")as well as featurettes that focus on the cast and director Sacha Gervasi's decision to make the film.<br /><br />The most informative extra is the commentary by director Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of \\"Psycho\\" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.<br /><br />While not exactly 100% factual, \\"Hitchcock\\" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama. As long as you keep in mind that this isn't like a documentary on Hitch and the making of \\"Psycho\\" you can enjoy the film.Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of \\"Psycho\\" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.<br /><br />While not exactly 100% factual, \\"Hitchcock\\" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama.

B005S9EKCW|4.0|A long time ago Hollywood had actors who were also more than competent singers and dancers, I am thinking of course of Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Liza Minnelli. When they decided to use movie stars in musicals, like Deborah Kerr in the King and I, Natalie Wood in West Side Story or Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady they at least had the decency of using a good singer for the musical numbers, like the much missed (and needed) Marni Nixon, who dubbed Kerr, Wood and Hepburn. But recently something really outrageous is happening, they are asking Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter to sing Sweeney Todd (an aberration), and now Hugh Jackman and Russsell Crowe embarrass themselves in Les Misérables. The vocal demands in this musical are greater than average, and I can't possibly agree with Amazon who says:  <Crowe seems an odd choice for Javert and is definitely outsung by the other members of the cast, he holds his own when it really counts with solos that are on-pitch and arguably even more powerful for their imperfections.> No, his solos are not on pitch, not even by American Idol standards, he quite simply does NOT have a professional singing voice, his singing is pure comedy. I can understand though why Hugh Jackman was cast as Jean Valjean, he is a very likable and charismatic fellow, but the vocal demands put on him are quite simply not met, his singing in \\"Bring him home\\" is effortful and painful to hear. And why his hair is not completely white? Let's not forget that Marius'friends nicknamed him Monsieur Leblanc because of his white hair.<br />Ann Hathaway too delivers an extremely poor \\"I dreamed a dream\\", it is true that the woman is dying, but she doesn't have to sound like it at the expense of the vocal line, like any soprano who has sung La Traviata will tell you.<br />I think it was a good idea of Tom Hooper to film the actors live while singing, but to do that he should have used extremely good singers, like Roberto Alagna for Jean Valjean, Bryn Terfel for Javert (what an improvement on Crowe he might have been!!!!) and Diana Damrau as Fantine. The most successful musical number by far is \\"Do you hear the people singing\\" where at least Marius and Enjolras do sing in tune and in high spirits.<br />In spite of my disappointment with the singing, the film still makes an impression, no doubt thanks to Hooper's ability to tell a story, it's just that it could and should have been much better, one can only wonder what Vincent Minnelli would have thought of this.
B007SGM084|4.0|Obviously this isn't an in depth serious set of books. I was initially scared, despite the hype, after hearing it was based on fan fiction from those horribly written twilight books. Thankfully, nothing like those horrid books! This wasn't *too* bad in terms of writing. For the first two books, yes there were vague parts, and parts where the author's use of certain redundant lines for the characters were tiring, but overall not bad. References for classic literature and music was enjoyable.<br />For the last book, the same redundancies kept coming back, and in many parts, it was like the author pulled out the thesaurus to try and cover her typical redundant words and phrases for her characters which seemed forced. The love of classical music and literature the author tossed in during the first two books disappeared; and one of the most annoying things was the three seemingly improbable &#34;crisis&#34; Anna and Christian faced all within a 2-month time period. It was also super annoying, as someone who lives in Seattle, that the author didn't do more research about how one gets around downtown and how the 520 bridge/highway actually works! Honestly, a HUGE peeve was in the part where Anna & Christian go from Bellevue to Escala (which is an actual luxury condo), they take Stewart Street - and she describes it as a north/south road, which it is NOT - Stewart runs east/west. Escala is off 4th Ave, which is a one-way north street... subtle details missed which are annoying.<br /><br />And SPOILER&#62;&#62;&#62;<br /><br />The whole pregnancy thing seemed forced at best. The language/phrases she had Anna use came across as juvenile and ridiculous at best; and based on the development of Anna and Christian in the two prior books, I was highly disappointed she kept and/or didn't lose the baby. The epilogue for 2yrs later would've been more believable if she had been finally pregnant with their first child; the epilogue detailing Anna & Christian's meeting from his POV wasfun.<br /><br />Overall, a fun, easy beach read.
B002N44XSG|3.0|I liked this book because it had an element of surprise to it. I think it could've described the characters  a bit better, but overall it was a pretty good book.

You have to believe in super-science that is more than quite a bit beyond the real deal, and you have to believe that Walter is the ultimate source of knowledge on EVERY subject, but it always has killer intro sequences and keeps you wanting a bit more.  I recommend it overall.  It's addictive.

1423124960|5.0|I have a 4 year old in LOVE with anything Disney Princess.  She really enjoys this book.  The stories are not the traditional stories but are still pretty cute.  If she had it her way she would have me read several every night but we stick to 1 or 2 b/c they are pretty blah for parents.  Glad it has more substance than the Little Golden Book Princess books.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play it because it is the best way to pass time,I love the zip line,but I don't like the mine cart. I recommend this game to all gamers.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|The book was very interesting and I thought somewhat intense for the young readers and didn't know if they would actually comprehend all that the book had to offer.  I was a little disappointed that some of the characters after the war were not explored further.  Overall, an absorbing read.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I was ready to jump into the next great, epic world. These books contain some new and intriguing ideas, but they aren't at all well developed. The characters are rather flat and not at all developed over the course of the series. The author skips over parts of real emotional struggle, and we never know why many characters make the decisions they do. The writing seems extremely amateur when compared to the popular ones that somebody thought to relate Morgan Rice to: J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini, and J.R.R. Tolkien? These are all wonderful writers and storytellers that any fantasy author would aspire to emulate, but I'm afraid Morgan Rice has a long way to go before she can be counted among these.

0345803485|3.0|New Blood Writes Fifty Shades Of Grey - Review by Hartford Group International    It's hard to believe that many readers' all-time favorite Harry Potter series has been surpassed in popularity by another literary piece in the market. Where all the fuss was coming from was not clear at first. The author was relatively unknown. But this same mystery was what drew people to Fifty Shades of Grey - the first title in what eventually became a bestselling series.    Fifty Shades Of Grey is an erotic book. It is considered by some as mom's porn. Many were surprised at the contents of the seemingly harmless and unassuming book. Some were shocked at the brave and forward way that scenes and characters were described as the story unfolded.    The story is narrated using the perspective of Anastasia Steele, the main character of the novel. She is a naïve, innocent, clumsy, and insecure woman. Most importantly, she was a virgin when she met Christian Grey, a rather drop dead gorgeous \\"multi- bagillionaire\\". You might ask why that is important but believe me it is an important detail in the plot of the story.    >Ana and Christian met when Ana substituted for her best friend Kate to interview Christian. From then on, Christian became intrigued with Anastasia. He made his presence felt and sought Ana's attention whenever he could. It was kind of irritatingly romantic actually. The plot thickens when one night, Christian revealed some aspects of his personality to Ana. He is one sick kinky man. He shocked Ana by offering a sexual relationship that involved BDSM. She did not give him her consent at first. But in the end, she gave in to Christian's terms. On the other hand, Christian had no idea that she was a virgin. He \\"educated\\" her. Anastasia eventually realized how badly she was treated sexually. She cannot stomach that the love of her life was letting her feel the way she feels. She left the poor Mr. Grey.    There goes the story of the first book of James' trilogy. Even though it was an interesting read, the book was not as well written as more popular books. But, there is something in the book that grips the readers and makes them keep on turning the pages despite the poor narrative. Phrases like \\"flushed crimson\\" and \\"wicked grin\\" were repeated all too frequently in the pages from the first chapter to the last. Still, there is much hope and mystery left for readers to look forward to the next installment in the series.    -    Hartford Group International is a book review club of avid readers from all around the world.

B005TQACLC|5.0|This tour was not my favorite of Britney's ICONIC tours but it was a lot of fun! It is great to see that she was able to pick herself up and continue to dominate the pop world. We went and saw the Femme Fatale Tour twice in Chicago and we had a blast! Britney fans will be pleased.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|G5 seems to add that little extra to their games making them hard to put down. If you enjoy hidden object games G5 games are the best.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A friend suggested I read this. well written, but the ending is somewhat disturbing, Which is I suspect, the point.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Even if you don't agree or understand what's happening with the wars or the conflict going on in our world, you have to see this movie. I loved Ben Affleck in this and he surely earned his Academy Awards he won. A must see movie.
1400067820|5.0|I love essays because of the lack of boundaries. It is pretty nice to defend your opinions with your own experience (although nonscientific at all ... :)).<br /><br />In the past those rich, smart and not accommodated people (like Plato, Aristotle and Voltaire) where responsible to bring us new perspective of thinking. Since they were introduced into the high level of Society but not crunched or 'kidnapped' by it, they could understand it in a better direct way than we naive-committed-tired middle-class could.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this guy does not need to live with his book selling revenues, but event though he writes by itch and hunch (and it makes sense for him and has been making sense on the market - more than just luck - for him...).<br />If you are unmotivated reading those pseudo-academic-administration books, just take a look on this one and try to test one of its precepts. It will not hurt, or ... :)<br /><br />Enjoy...
B0091W6QZG|5.0|One of Marty's stronger efforts; certainly his best collaboration with Dicaprio. A fascinating story exceptionally well-photographed and told-great score as well....
0385742886|5.0|I decided to read this before reading The Maze Runner series. Makes sense because this is the Prequel. Love the characters and the story line. Especially Alec. Reminds me of my Grandfather who was a Gunny in the Marine Corps. After reading this I thought about the story and began reading The Maze Runner then it suddenly hit me as I thought back on the story line of The Kill Order... There is a scientific flaw. In the Kill Order it talks about a world turned upside down due to Sun Flares. 2 years after Society is trying to get back on its feet through little colonies. Then suddenly the colonies are attacked by the new form of government using air craft called Bergs. I imagine the big C-130 planes the way they are described. Mark and Alec rebel and strike back against one of the bergs causing it to crash. After surviving the crash the find a touch pad and find a map on it. Mark, Trina, Alec and Lana begin their journey, under Alec's guidance and experience in the millitary, following the map on the pad and using Alec's compass. Now during a real Sun Flare storm, the storm itself would definitely upset the Earth's magnetic polarity so a compass WOULD NOT show a point to true North.<br /><br />Other than this flaw the story is awesome. A definite must buy and read....  As I stated I have already started reading The Maze Runner but I am gonna have to re-order the series before I read any more because my series came from the UK. I live in the US. My series is in UK language format. It talks about centimetre and metres... And when you get into a good reading rythm and suddenly the book talks about something 6 meters across instead of feet or 10 square centimetres, that rythm is halted cause you are trying to break it down. LOL... So far The Maze Runner is awesome.... Only has 2 references to The Kill Order though....
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I had been looking for this movie in 3D for a while and finally found it on sale on Amazon.  Coraline is a fun movie but may be alittle scary for kids under ten.  It has one of those hidden lessons for kids, which is fine, and Coraline shows that with alittle help, even a kid can accomplish whatever needs to be done to make the wrongs of another right.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|Prior to FP most films in this genre most were B/W 4:3 cheap budget entities - yes I know there were others but this film struck a chord with me as we were doing Shakespeare at High School at the time so I could see the parallels. The other area of interest was the technical representation of the craft. One aspect in particular struck me as a now retired sound engineer was the 'cordless' microphone the captain used - there were none in commercial production in 1956 but now! Look at any musical or concert.<br />I also liked the concept of the 'creatures of the Id' and  Freud was still flavour of the month back then but passe now?
B004VRL4BM|4.0|As far as it is an import from Europe it is received quiet well in my home. If you like this kind of scyfy drama this would be your cup of tea .

B00AQCMK32|1.0|Unplayable, buggy, hurts your eyes and ears, everything is wrong with this game. Go throw your two bucks at a con artist, you'll get much more fun out of being scammed. That's pretty much what this is, a scam. Stay away.
B004QSQMKE|4.0|Another Gift. Old time favorite. This movie is a little different but great. Recommend to anyone who likes movies. Especially people that like romance,unicorns and princesses .

B002YCVX5S|5.0|It was good entertainment, if somewhat confusing by the shifting around of the story line. In the end it all came together to make a good ending.
B006JTS5OO|4.0|This was a gift. They loved it. Who wouldn't it's the muppets.<br />Really funny movie ,adult humor in some parts.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Hard to put down; this review is hard to write given that I have now read all of the books, and the whole world of Wool just gets more dynamic and engaging.
0307346609|1.0|One of the most disappointing books I have ever read in my entire life. I hated the writing, the story line, and all the characters (lack of). This book had major potential, but it just fell apart right at the beginning.<br /><br />The story is basically just snippets told to a reporter by some of the major players who were involved in the Zombie War. A majority were military related that made no sense since and were hard to understand being that this is a made-up war in the authors mind. If you have no military experience or understanding the whole book will be lost on you. Even with my extensive knowledge of the Civil War I was still lost and could barely follow along.<br /><br />I felt nothing for any of the characters or story tellers in the book. I felt nothing for the reporter as well since he seemed to be yelled at or made to look stupid at times which I could understand since he annoyed the ever loving hell out of me as well.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I could care less. I'm just thrilled to be done with this and I find it silly to repeat what has already been said in many of the other 1 star ratings that have already been published. I agree with all of them.
B00005JLR2|1.0|This movie is garbage.  A bungling mess of a plot, characters you won't care about and characters you will hate.  That stupid robot on treasure planet B.E.N might as well just be called Annoying Robin Williams.  That shapeshifting bubble is useless and annoying.  Jim Hawkins is a little D-bag.  This movie is awful.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love it and watched it right away, this is so much better than the play..... fantastic buy. You must try this movie.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|If you like this type of story it's good to get them all at once because each individual one is so short. I picked this up because it was compared to the Hunger Games. Not exactly. The story was depressing and it didn't have thte optimism nor futuristic character that the Hunger Games had. There was not enough to keep my interest in what happens next to get the next set of books.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love Castle! Have the first four seasons as well.  In the tradition of Bones and NCIS with it's own unique twist!  Crime lovers who love word play will love Castle!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I look for this app for every device I own and download it promptly. It has without a doubt revolutionized the way Bible reading and studying, and devotions can be done. It's just all here at your fingertips. Can't recommend this enough.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love musicals, but unlike most of the other people reviewing this I was not familiar with Les Miserables. I had heard some of the music, but did not know the story at all. I found the movie to be heartbreaking and beautiful. I have read a lot of criticism of Russel Crowe, but I loved him in it! I love his voice. I thought the entire cast, especially Samantha Banks, did a wonderful job. It was a tad raunchy in parts, but overall, the message of redemption and forgiveness is wonderful.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game!You can breed so many different dragons. You can get rare and limited dragons to. You can also enter your dragons in competitions. In all my other games I get bored. But in this game I never get bored. I really recommend this game.

0451232852|3.0|This was the first Ken Follett I had read and deals with a time in history, the turn of the 20th Century that I find interesting.<br /><br />Follett chronicles the lives of the poor in Wales and Russia and the rich and ruling classes in England, Russia and America.  I found the book lost its way frequently and at times I wasn't sure if I was reading a text on the First World War or the Russian Revolution.  The building of characters was good in the case of Ethel and Maud, particularly surrounding the parting of their ways.  However there was a shallowness to many of the other characters particularly Fitz and Bea.  I also suspected that some of the story was specifically written to appeal to US readers, for instance the character Gus Dewar and Lev Peshkov (after leaving Wales)could really have been left out without significantly changing the substance of the book, particularly bringing the mafia style club owner and prohibition added nothing. The flight from Prince Andrei's estate was predictable and rather tacky, as was the march on the Winter Palace and hanging of the Peshkov father. I wasn't sure that the character Robert von Ulrich played any real role in the book but perhaps that will become more apparent with the sequel which I suspect will be about the rise of Hitler.<br /><br />On the political side I felt that there was a missed opportunity to build on King George V and Lloyd George, whilst Churchill's gung ho attitude to restoring imperial Russia was well chronicled. The growing realisation of Grigori Peshkov to the realities of the ruling classes was also well written.<br /><br />I did like the final scene in the Palace of Westminster and the subtle change in power.<br /><br />The book could have been edited to about half the length with more succinct writing and better editing, I often thought that Follett gave details that were irrelevant to anyone with some knowledge of the time and those reader who hadn't and were sufficiently interested could easily research them.[[ASIN:0451232852 Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy]]

B0050AV5MW|2.0|I absolutely love Game of Thrones, I've actually read the series twice now - first in paperback and then on my Kindle whilst on holiday. Obviously the story was the same so my complaint is nothing to do with content, but there were so many typos/formatting errors in the Kindle version! I had been reading a lot of the free classics on Kindle previously, and I understood that those are submitted by volunteers and usually from old content of which there probably isn't a digital copy, so some mistakes are probably inevitable. But I've purchased several books recently (many of them published in the last year or two) on Kindle which have mistakes in them, and it's getting a bit frustrating! They're generally not much cheaper than hard copies of the book (some are even more expensive), if I enjoy something I can't share it, and now I don't even feel like I'm getting a completely accurate copy of the text... I enjoy the convenience of the Kindle, especially when it means I don't have to lug around a big book like any of the Song of Fire and Ice series, but I'm starting to think it's not worth the money when the books are full of inaccuracies. Surely the publishers have digital copies, especially of more recent books, which they can format for Kindle and that would eliminate the chance of any mistakes... or at the very least they could hire a proofreader! I'll do it!
B00005YW4H|3.0|This album is very subdued and the music lacks drama and dynamics.  It is more for easy listening and falling asleep.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|The game is awesome, but I have serious beef with the small ball that randomly pops up that will end your game if you don't have two balls of the same color connected on the board already. I wouldn't dislike it so much except for the fact that there's no warning and sometimes they come out after the level is over and there aren't any bubbles left to pop. Thus, your game ends for no reason from time to time.
B007YJS7G4|4.0|The action scenes were pretty awesome..Overall liked this movie..Plus it is pretty accuate with history.  Cuba Gooding JR is such a good actor in his diverse roles.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|If you like Apple products, you'll like this book. It provides an insight to what makes their simplicity and seamless integration work and why it wouldn't have worked with anyone else leading the charge. It also shows the importance of honesty, brutal honesty, and how people can be pushed far beyond what they believe are their limits.

I get chills just thinking about it.  Most everyone has an idea of this famous storyline, but this version exceeded all expectations.  I highly recommend this movie.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I almost didn't buy it because of the many bad reviews but after reading this I loved Abby and Travis's story! I have come to the conclusion that quite a number of people grew up with a \\"charmed\\" childhood and had it pretty good so I understand why they wouldn't \\"get\\" this story or like it. Life isn't all a bed of roses for everyone. And I like many others come from an abusive and violent childhood. My step-father didn't break things or hit other people, he hit me and my sister and my brother. The emotional, mental, and physical abuse he put us through was a nightmare. He appeared to be a great guy with a great life and no one thought differently. But I knew the monster he hid well. Travis's outbursts and breaking things is really nothing, he never hits Abby or any other woman. He is a bit possessive but he doesn't try to hide how he feels and is very aware when he messes up, I don't feel this books sends the wrong message. I have been known to violent outbursts and throwing things but I never hurt anyone. So I felt their story was actually refreshing to read something that didn't have the constant \\"happy, happy, life is perfect to it.\\" I can't wait to read Travis's POV!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|We rented this to laugh; it was depressing.  I am 40 and could not relate.  The best part of the movie was the last song by Ryan Adams.

0765348276|5.0|Writing: 5<br />Story: 4.5<br />Satisfaction: 5<br /><br />Before reading Old Man's War, I thought that military sci-fi was a genre I was just destined to dislike. I usually find the characters unlikeable and the text too technical for reading enjoyment. However, I really loved Old Man's War.<br /><br />At some point in the future, John Perry age 75 joins the Colonial Defense Force (CDF), a mysterious agency recruiting the elderly and with the ability to make an old body young again. The cost? 2 years active service with the potential of an extension to 10 years and then relocation to live the rest of your life on a human colony somewhere else in space.<br /><br />John is looking for a new start and his story is not an unusual account for a new recruit to the CDF.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this is Scalzi's first book. It's incredibly well written and has a lot of great characterization. The plot line is not overly novel but from the way John's perspective is written, it feels very fresh. I especially liked that though there was a lot of technological wonders, they all came secondary to character relationships and character development - something that I find reversed in a lot of military science fiction.<br /><br />I'll definitely pick up more of Scalzi's works. He is definitely a talent.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|I loved this little game. I got it for free the other day but if I had the money I would have paid the $2. It has kept me entertained. Its like temple run games but its side scrolling and you can actually go backwards if you miss something. Most of the time you end up having to go backwards anyways to complete the level. Its easy enough to keep you coming back but not too difficult to where you dont feel like picking it up and playing because you dont have enough time to try and finish it. Id suggest buying it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Unbelievable what these men do for us and how unappreciative most Americans are of their sacrifice. This should be required reading for every American citizen.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Anyone  who has read anything by Lee Child knows that they can expect a real page turner that you will read into the wee small hours and you still dont want to put it down. The Hard Way was no exception.....Reacher is up to his old tricks again and Lee Child builds up the tension again until it drives you crazy. WAY TO GO Mr. Child...KEEP EM' COMING!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really good can't wait for the movie. Hurry up and come out already. I don't want to wait another year.
B0058VW36U|5.0|A very simple game that really makes you think!!  I cant<br />'t believe how fun it u<br />is to feed that little green monster!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and easy to play. My 7 year old loves to play also. Thank you for making it.
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book was a little one dimensional but still kept my interest. The other two books were much better. I was more interested in the back story in this book. The author did a good job developing the characters through the three books. If you read this be prepared to read the whole series or you will be left with several unanswered questions.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it.  Great love story with plenty of spice.  I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading Walking Disaster!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|good game. lots of fun. but you will play. and have it on every device! I do and I play it everywhere.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i use pinterest every day and this application makes it easy. i love the most recent update as well. very streamlined.
B009E3EYS8|4.0|Made the mistake of not getting the Blu-Ray.  Still clean enough on the HD TV.  A must have for any Zeppelin fan.
B0001I561E|5.0|Good quality. Developed a&#34;skip&#34; in one spot that stops the DVD but that may have happened at my home instead.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|They are so great and I got such a great deal on the trilogy! I am on book 2 soon to be book 3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very fun. It is also addicting. It is a girls dream. It is great for people who want a real horse, but have no room.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|I'm not quite sure how to categorize Band Of Horses. Similar to Pure Prarie League (folksy soft rock) but with nothing that stands out. What did catch my ear on the first track was the pleasant voices. Then the music became a bit loud for the voices. The voices sang well, but at the same time with the same pitch and tone... on every track. Nothing stood out as a singular emphasis on any song. The music was too similar on every song also.<br />Take any successful band and they had a sound. Their songs didn't all sound alike but you knew who it was singing. Like the Rolling Stones Babylon and Beast of Burden.... or even Hang Fire. Take the Beatles Norweigan Wood and Come Together. You can go on and on here but my point is that every song was too similar on this CD. I haven't heard anything else from this band, and after hearing this CD I really don't want to. As with anyone else, you can have 'flops'. But, if one's introduction is not setting right with them then they're likely to not want to sample anything else from their catalogue.<br />Apparently they have an audience as I see they've released a number of CD's. However, they are not for me.
B003VANOFY|2.0|My pair started falling apart after about 8 months of daily use - first the plastic casing around the microphone cracked until it just dangled by a couple wires off the side of the headset, which I was able to tape up. More recently, the vinyl on the earpieces is peeling off and getting all over my clothes whenever I wear them.<br /><br />Won't be buying another set, sadly - they were awesome for those first 8 months, but at this price, they should last longer than that.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Bought this book on the advice of a relative who is also a massage therapist.  She and her family had tried the program and found it useful for them.  After reading just the first few chapters, I was convinced to give it a try.  The great news was that the plan worked for my family and I!  We are happily eating and enjoying real food.<br /><br />The book is well layed out and the information presented is complete and informative.  I appreciate that the authors explain in great detail how the body processes and uses the food we eat (or doesn't, depending on what we consume).  The exlaination of \\"food with no brakes\\" really helped me understand the reason that even food that *seems* healthy doesn't really improve our health and can in fact, cause health issues.<br /><br />I was glad to see that the authors, though very invested in and commited to the program, don't believe that you can NEVER again have a piece of cake or a slice of bread.  The emphasis is on following the program for 30 days and then evaluating food groups that have been removed one at a time to determine what effect, if any, they have on YOUR body.  There is great emphasis on being very self-aware.  It is so important to know how each food/food group affects YOU.<br /><br />I liked that the book also gave suggestions for dealing with those folks who might not appreciate this \\"new\\" approach to eating.  We had some of those in our lives and the suggestions for dealing with them worked.  Very helpful.
B0091REZMW|3.0|enjoy the puzzles but won't pay to play. People who are. on fixed. incomes don't have money for games. It is a good way to challenge your brain.
B005OK81HA|3.0|My music tastes were built around 80's Hard Rock and Metal Music.  Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, etc.  The Scorpions were always a favorite of mine.  I saw this CD and decided to buy it.  I love their music, but I almost regret buying this.  Their classic songs on this CD are not re-masters, but re-done with a new perspective.  The originals are much better, and it seems as if the band did these remakes in two hours.  The rest of the album is covers of other songs, and they are good, and probably save me from rating this album lower than 3 Stars.  Here's hoping the Scorps aren't done making new music, because I don't want to remember them with this one.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|An unusual story told in a compelling style.  I was instantly invested and remained that way from start to finish.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I'm 44, and primarily listen to Hard Rock/Metal.  However, when I need to just listen to some 80's stuff, I get into Huey Lewis and the News.  I have never owned a CD by the band.  I heard a song on the radio and decided to look online for a &#34;best of&#34; CD.  I found it, ordered it and I really love it.  I am familiar with every song on this CD, and most groups can't boast that their &#34;best of&#34; CD has songs that everyone will know.  I also heard the band may be going on a Tour for the 30th Anniversary of their album &#34;Sports&#34;.  Excellent CD.  Glad I purchased it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|slow at the beginning then picks up. was overall a decent and enjoyable book towards the end. wouldn't read again.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Great game until it freezes up.<br />My grandson downloaded it and loves playing when it doesn't freeze up.<br />Maybe because it is new it does this. And after a few upgrades, it will work fine.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|After I got a whiff of the rotten cheese smell coming from the first \\"Expendables\\" I figured I'd need a gas mask to watch the second. I was wrong! Yes, Expendables 2 still smells of cheese but, this one had a much better aroma. The story and action sequences in part 2 were much better and, I've got to hand it to the director for taking what was just plain bad and turning it into something \\"so bad it's good\\" which, is not easy to do. I hate to admit it but, I had a really good time watching this. It's more than worth the price of admission for action fans.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Installed this, turned on my computer and started transferring files. my dual core took forever, this thing handles 84GB data transfer like its taking 10GB. I opened at least twelve programs at once, i just randomly clicked a bunch of them, they opened up without any problems. the only regret i have with this is not getting it sooner, better then i have predicted. my games used to slow down because my crappy processor couldnt handle them, now games don't push my processor at all. at idle this things is at 2-6%, playing games 20-55%
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This movie had a lot going for it, too bad it never really got across the finish line. The story and pacing get muddy which, always seems to smear the acting. Decent action if you can forgive the over-the-top, retro style and the non-Kung Fu talent of RZA or Russell Crowe. It was silly but fun, a good try but really lacking in any kind of substance. I would have given it two and a half stars if that was possible. For the effort, it gets three.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a nice game. It is a challenge to beat the game. I love it better than anyone that does
B007MNV5WU|5.0|love it great game i love playing this angry birds game. thank you, add more stuff to it though. thanks
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is GREAT.  Very challenging &amp; fun.  I really like it &amp; would suggest for my family &amp; friends.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Thanks AMAZON for having this on sale (record label)!  At first look I passed as the song choices didn't click with me.  I took a chance and I'm So Glad!  Clapton's voice is superb.  So are the arrangements, production and performances (musicians and singers).  Tasty, tasty tasty!  Flows with lots of nice grooves.  Anyway I highly recommend this and would say...give it a chance.<br /><br />For those who feel slighted that there is not enough Clapton soloing...well there is lots of that already isn't there?  This is just DAMN GOOD!  For me, he shows up at the right  time, with just the right amount.<br /><br />Btw, the song choices are great (amazing all the way around), it's just that initally I didn't think I would be interested in Clapton doing them.  Shucks, he fooled me big time.<br /><br />Also, the children singing in  \\"Every Little Thing\\" are perfect.  I know, I've been working with kids for over 20 years (music) and the performers sound \\"natural\\" but they deliver perfectly.  Imo.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I just love it. I'm reading so much and learning a lot. My wife is getting into this.  We'll be starting a system soon.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I watch this once a year and always enjoy David Bowie's opening monologue.  This is one of the best Christmas movies ever made!!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I almost gave up on this book in the first 10% but then it got drastically better and I was wishing it wouldn't end.  I will definitely read this book again, it's a keeper!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I have all the movies in this series and, even though I am a monster Tom Selleck fan from back in the MagnuM PI days, I can say he has gotten better as he's gotten older.  Highly recommend!!!

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abby is of the best in acting and story telling. Surprises around every corner keep you hooked on the show.
1608193381|3.0|This book is easy to read, is written in good and accessible language, has some good points and is probably a very convincing text on economics, for those who don't know any better (sorry, but it's true).<br /><br />The author is a political leftist, despite himself saying, that he is a capitalist in search of reforms to capitalism. His socialist tendencies are many. This should become clear to the reader very soon.<br /><br />The author is not a very good economist. He does not seem to have any knowledge of economics beyond the most orthodox \\"mainstream\\" views of men like Ricardo, Adam Smith, Milton Friedman and a few others (even Karl Marx gets a special praise for insights and foresight). Where is Hayek, to name an obvious example of a missing economics reference? The most serious aspect of this lack of any sound economics is his minimal grasp of any kind of capital theory (a theory on the role, source and importance of capital in an economy). Only fractions of any understanding of capital accumulation and access are visible (mostly in the chapter on micro-loans). So be aware if you want to seek knowledge in economics from this book!<br /><br />The book is, like I say in the review title, mostly reflections of a person to the left. He would fit very well within a European Social Democratic party, or the Democratic Party in the USA. His world view is that of a kind and wise State and its rulers, and a stupid and reckless free market of millions of individuals. As such a book, it is very enlightening and even entertaining. But that's it.
030758836X|4.0|Interesting hybrid of a book. Made for good beach reading. Characters got more and more difficult to relate to as story advanced, but still curiosity kept me reading.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|This is not an easy app. I am not too good on touch screens so it may be just me. I seem to press all sorts of things but it will not give the answer unless you push the equal sign. ex. Normally on my pocket calculator I can push 1+1+ and it will give me 2, on this I push 1+1+ and if I want (2) I must backspace and push the equal sign. However it is better than nothing in a pinch and you remember to hit the equal sign.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So, I saw the movie first. It was different, but I'm a good way. This is the type of book that will make you laugh and cry and your heart grow. This is one of the greater books I have read, mostly because this is the latest one I have read!;) I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I just moved in a new apartment with no cable and this has been a great movie to watch over and over again.<br /><br />Context Notes: I hate Glee and there's never been a musical I've enjoyed... Until now!<br /><br />Anna Kendricks shines, Fat Amy is fat-tastic and Bumper (Adam Devine) is a super funny upgraded Jack Black. Many manly men (such as myself) will want to initially resist the charm of this movie but trust me, just take it all in. You just might even find yourself appreciating the musical aspects of acapella.<br /><br />The character development is really well done here, the humor is really well placed and I would consider this a great guy movie that you could enjoy with your hunny.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is one of the best games in the world it is so fun you who marital is great<br />love it
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Anne Hathaway is incredible in this movie version of Les Miserables.  I loved the stage version and the sound track.  The movie is a wonderful addition to your movie collection to watch again and again.  It is a story for the ages.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Was a good movie but not as good as MI 3. still worth a view. Five more words required so.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I loved the movie and want to watch it again.  If you like historical movies, this is one you will watch several times.  Speilburg at his best.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It freaking sucks won't log in it really tiked me off bigggg time now they have outlook .com that sucks too
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|For the fan and collector of the incredible series, this set will allow you to watch the entire season again and again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was an amazing book I can not wait to read the other two books either. Katniss and Peeta are a powerful couple.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I love this book - and I'll read it again, sometime. Harold and his story stay with you, and as with all good friends, the more you get to know about them the more there is to know. Great stories have qualities that contribute to even deeper understandings when you encounter them again; this story will do that, I am sure.    Harold's pilgrimage was to save the terminally ill Queenie, to belatedly acknowledge her extraordinary self-sacrifice, as a genuine friend, at a time when he was so distraught and ashamed he could only be entirely self-absorbed. But his story has more to do with the resolution of painfully solitary existence within those relationships we all expect to be the most fulfilling: childhood, marriage and parenting.  His  halting and painful journey, on foot, from one end of Britain to the other, is his rite of passage to another existence,  with test upon test of his dedication.  It is an extraordinary and heroic journey of memories, discoveries,  jubilation and despair for Harold, and for his wife, Maureen.    This is an extraordinarily gentle and unpretentious story of grief, guilt, regret, self-discovery and renewal.  It's a book that affectionately dwells with you long after you have finished reading it.    I was very much reminded of Maccoll's chosen quotation as a preface to 'In falling snow'.     \\"It was a lesson about ordinary people – and the lesson was that they were not ordinary\\"    Paul Keating's Remembrance Day speech 1993 [...]    Maccoll  was referring to heroic qualities of ordinary individuals in theatrical circumstances. In contrast, Harold's circumstances are very simply commonplace, and he epitomises the potential for the heroic journey lurking within any of us.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Very happy with the purchase and the price of the blu ray.  Huge Norman Reedus fan so I enjoy it even more
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved this game. want more. give me more more more.  hurry hurry hurry.  great suspense and finding hidden objects.  more please.
B00C0OOV5O|5.0|The Walking Dead is by far the best show on cable network and amazon streaming is the easiest way to get a hold of the next episode. I do not have cable because I have been steaming netflix. If you are like me and cannot wait for it to come on netflix this is an awesome alternative.
B00C4QVQV0|1.0|Couldn't wait to wake up this morning and watch the season finale but obviously can't rely on Amazon to be ready. Amazon is experiencing problems streaming \\"Welcome to the Tombs\\", fine, but THREE hours later still can't access something that has already been billed for, not very impressive. Should have purchased through one of the hundred other options for streaming.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|It is even better than &#34;Cold Fact&#34; and I love &#34;Cold Fact&#34;.  He is so artistic, thoughtful, classic and his enunciation is excellent.  I love the words, the thought behind the words and the music is fabulous.  It is too, bad those are the only two recordings that he has made.  Although, he is older, I hope that he makes more recordings.  The documentary of his life is so touching and although he clearly has been cheated of a great deal of money, he has no bitterness.  That is remarkable. This artist is humble and very gifted.  I just love the music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Loved it it was slow at first, but it was amazing. I am so ready to watch the movie.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I love this game!! It takes your logic skills, and brain to get the fire away. It is such a fun game!! LOVE IT!
B006YC74E8|4.0|It is a good photo editor for free, and is a great deal. Easy to use and worth using and buying!!
B000HZD168|4.0|It is a great movie. I love the Star Trek universe. I would reccomend it to anybody that I know.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|IT BROUGHT BACK  MEMORIES FROM YOUNGER DAYS WHEN I LIVED FOR SCI FI BOOKS.  IT WAS  WELL WORTH THE TIME.
1400069742|4.0|I think that the common perception about America's position regarding its participation in World War II prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor was strongly isolationist, which made it impossible for President Roosevelt to support the UK to the extent that he would have preferred.  Lindbergh is identified as the face of this isolationist position, which seems to be understood as being the majority position until the surprise attack by Japan changed public opinion.  This book shows that this understanding of history is overly simplistic and largely incorrect.<br /><br />This book explores the (very) heated debate about what the role of the United States should be in World War II, relying upon actual quotes from contemporary sources such as newspapers and letters to illustrate the positions taken and the fierceness of the political battles over this issue.  And as this book makes clear, this was an ugly fight, with both sides relying upon both solid arguments as well as innuendo and character assassination to try and persuade the American people to support their positions.  While Roosevelt would have preferred a more interventionist position, he was still nursing the political wounds he had suffered in his battle to reshape the Supreme Court into a body more supportive of his agenda.  These wounds, combined with his campaign for an unprecedented third term, made him incredible cautious about committing the country to any intervention without clear approval.  And even within his administration, there were plenty of isolationists who opposed American entry into the War.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it seems that the opinions of the majority of Americans did shift away from the isolationist position, but the isolationist movement had many prominent spokesmen, including a significant number of members in Congress, so that the politics of the issue did not readily shift to follow public opinion, and the efforts to aid the British remained feeble, at best.<br /><br />Perhaps the most eye-opening revelations of this book are the extent to which the British government actively (if secretly) campaigned to influence the American politics on this issue.  These effort extended far beyond conventional diplomacy, and included investigative efforts directed to uncovering embarrassing information about prominent isolationists, which could then be used by proponents of the US entry into the war effort to discredit those who opposed them.  There were also significant British efforts to influence the American media with pro-British propaganda in an attempt to sway public opinion on these issues.<br /><br />While this book is a useful corrective analysis of the debate about US war policy during the early years of World War II, it is also a powerful reminder that the ugliness of our political culture is not a recent phenomenon.  The use of dirty political tricks to influence American policy was just as common and nasty in the middle of the previous century as it is today, and this book is a reminder that we can move beyond such politics and actually accomplish important things, if properly motivated.st eye-opening revelations of this book are the extent to which the British government actively (if secretly) campaigned to influence the American politics on this issue.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Michael Moss certainly will make my top 10 list of non-fiction books for 2013 with his brilliant \\"Salt Sugar Fat\\", an incredibly well-researched book on the global food industry, the proliferation of processed food in developed nations (and increasingly developing ones) and the subsequent global health epidemics that have occurred as a result.<br /><br />I'd hazard a guess that no one, after finishing this book, will ever look at a package of Oreos, a bag of potato chips or roam the aisles of a grocery store without a keener sense of the larger forces at work in the global food industrial complex.  Of course, there has been a growing awareness and recognition of the inherent problems with this type of food so the use of these ingredients is unlikely to be a surprise to anyone who has ever looked at a label on a box or package of food.  Moss did extensive research for this book, accessing tons of public records and information as well as speaking to ex-executives of food companies, food scientists and a range of other individuals and organizations connected to the processed food \\"industrial complex\\".  What emerges it a fascinating picture of the holy trinity:  salt, sugar and fat.  These are the ingredients are government subsidizes (at the expense of fresh fruit and vegetables) to ensure near limitless supplies at unbelievably low costs that enable items that would otherwise be inedible to keep one coming back for more.  Scientists and researchers find the absolute precise amounts of these items needed to reach a \\"bliss point\\" or some other academic sounding term which is essentially a means to create an addiction to these ingredients and their tastes.<br /><br />There certainly aren't a tremendous amount of easy solutions to the problems and challenges that Moss covers in this book.  From the government policies favoring industry giants like Cargill and their massive production and distribution of commodities like corn, salt and sugar to the nature of public companies how they are beholden to Wall Street's quarterly earnings and the inexpensive prices of these manufactured foods relative to fresh, natural ingredients (and their proliferation in more socio-economically depressed areas) where those with less means face a decision getting some calories on the table for their family.<br /><br />\\"Salt, Sugar, Fat\\" is a book broad in scope, an examination of the consequences of convenience in a modern society and the massive impact on the food being produced for us to eat, what we choose to eat, the incentives our governments provide to certain producers (and those they don't provide to others) and the tremendous impact it is having on us all, virtually none of it beneficial.  There are certainly things that each of us can do individually to swim against this tide, but it is a bit daunting to read this book and not feel a bit powerless about our current situation and the path forward.ies how they are beholden to Wall Street's quarterly earnings and the inexpensive prices of these manufactured foods relative to fresh, natural ingredients (and their proliferation in more socio-economically depressed areas) where those with less means face a decision getting some calories on the table for their family.<br /><br />\\"Salt, Sugar, Fat\\" is a book broad in scope, an examination of the consequences of convenience in a modern society and the massive impact on the food being produced for us to eat, what we choose to eat, the incentives our governments provide to certain producers (and those they don't provide to others) and the tremendous impact it is having on us all, virtually none of it beneficial.

B0019N95IK|4.0|Scott Bakula stars as the first captain of the Enterprise, Jonathan Archer. Chief Engineer, Charles \\"trip\\" Tucker III (Connor Trinneer), Science Officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Lt. Malcolm Reed of Security (Dominic Keating),  Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery),  Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), and Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley) round out the rest of the main cast and crew of the Enterprise.<br /><br />This Star Trek series had a somewhat different feel from its predecessors, jumping back 100 years from the first series instead of the bright new future. And for once, the Vulcans are looked at in a negative way - as a people who hindered humanity's progress. The characters are a bit jaded, yet still embrace the spirit of exploration. This first season may be my favorite of this series. The stories are fresh. And the cast is new and just exploring their characters. While the show had its flaws, especially in its final seasons, I really enjoyed re-watching this first season of Enterprise since its recent move to blu-ray.  And this new set is packed full of special features - commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a 3-part documentary.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|As a newcomer to the Trek universe, I thought this film was well-created, introducing the characters and plot points nicely.<br />A couple Trekkie friends loved how the movie showed how characters they love come to meet each other. A little campy at times, but that seems to have been the charm of the franchise.<br /><br />Abrams makes excessive use of lens flare and reflection in the film, and while it looks cool, it gets tired by the end and distracting to the viewer at times.<br /><br />A new sci-fi favorite, though, and the sequel will probably steal another two hours of my butt in a chair.  ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game and have only had it for about tenminutes. If you don't have it get it! I promise yo will love it especially if you liked Temple Run!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this app. But that's just me because I love flow. The free version is the full version so definitely worth downloading!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I don't have HBO. I am a longtime reader of the works of George R.R. Martin, and I did not think any movie makers could ever do justice to his work. Happily I have been proven wrong. Ask anyone who has followed this show on HBO. It is a joy to behold, high production values, good acting (a refreshing change), and they are following the plot! Considering how many bad fantasy movies and programs have been made recently (even Eva Green couldn't save Arthur), this is a gift wrapped in gold.
0810993139|5.0|I love the hardcover books and my son really loves the series. The books are a great read for him, will keep buying as long as they keep writing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Always love big fishgames. Now im glad its s for android tablets. I can take it anywhere and play...would reommnd it to family an friends..
0810994739|5.0|I bought the books for my son and he loves them. We have seen all the movies and really enjoyed them.<br />The hardcover books are great
B001F0VHEM|5.0|i love Pink an this cd album is great, i love all songs and i never get tired to listen this album
B00980IA3M|4.0|I have purchased this set, but my family won't let me have it until Father'sDay. This is a huge Father's Day present for me.<br />However, even though I haven't yet listened, I am writing a review. My review is based on three sources: the 2008 Penguin Guide, the 1988 Metropolitan Opera Guide, and the authors, experts, and authorities listed on [...].<br />From all appearances, these are excellent to superb recordings. First of all, out of Wagner's mature period (say Dutchman onward), not less than FOUR of these recordings are listed at the very top of the list of available recordings by the Penguin Guide! The Metropolitan Opera Guide also lists many of these recordings as being on the top of their list. Of those recordings not especially noted in either of these two guides, the rest all receive highest recommendations from numerous Wagner authorities on wagneropera.net.<br />On top of all these accolades, four of these operas feature the glorious voiced Placido Domingo as the lead tenor. What more needs to be said?!?  [Other than that, one of them, Lohengrin, also features the incomparable Jessye Norman! As does Vakyrie] As for the Tristan, well it has its detractors. However, I remember very well when this performance was released in the 80's. It was HIGHLY acclaimed. And may I add that the conductor, Carlos Kleiber, is held in incredibly high esteem. He's practically a conducting legend.<br />As for the comment elsewhere that the Meistersinger is a DISASTER/TRAIN WRECK. Well, I mean, let's be serious. The chances of a performance with the likes of Dietrich Fischer-Diskau, the gloriously-voiced Christa Ludwig, and Placido Domingo, adding up to a train-wreck are about one in a million.<br />I am not a long-standing Wagner aficionado. I consider myself a rather new student of Wagner (which is why I am thrilled with coming to own this set).  While I may not be an aficionado, I have had more than a passing exposure to the wonders of Wagner. In the 70's, I attended somewonderful Wagner productions in San Francisco. This included a Tannhauser with Jess Thomas and Leonie Rysanek, a Valkyrie with Rysanek and Jon Vickers, and a Tristan with Birgit Nilsson, Jess Thomas, Yvonne Minton, and Kurt Moll. Having said that, I have listened to excerpts from this complete set of CDs and they all sound wonderful!<br />This is a limited edition. If you're on the fence on this one, don't be. A bargain of this quality is not likely to come our way, again, any time soon.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|This was a great read for those interested addiction/recovery or wanting to learn about the journey of the Kiedis and the Red Hots.  I found the book enjoyable and well written.  It also brings one closer to the music in a way that I have not previously felt.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|OK overall. Tommy Lee Jones is always good. Story a bit confusing, but suspenceful and surprising. I didn't figure out who the ringleader was close to the end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestyl didn't realize it was a Young Adult title until I had already read it.  What a great story, with lovely characters, and a nice view of the world.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|it is a good c.d., of old songs in a newage complentation, nice voices, i listen to it over, and over.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Really liked the beginning and middle..... really did not get the ending.  Felt so contrived!  I honestly don't understand all the raves about this book, and felt betrayed by Entertainment Weekly's usually consistent reviews for how highly they touted this one (of course the author used to write for the magazine).
0142501123|3.0|In, Room on the Broom by, Julia Donaldson, the witch and her cat were flying on their broomstick when a gust of wind blew and it blew off her hat and some other things.  Gratefully three nice animals helped her find her things.  Because they helped her, all they wanted in return was a nice ride home on her broom.  Will there be room on the broom and what will happen if there isn't?<br /><br />Book Review Written by:  Ainsley R., Age 8
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|If you are in your mid thirties+ and find that you have a bit of a... juvenile sense of humor you will likely get a kick out of this movie.  My wife and I are fans of the likes of &#34;Knocked Up&#34;, &#34;Zach & Miri Make a Porno&#34; etc and this doesn't disappoint in it's delivery.  Yes, this is a pretty low-brow comedy, but if you're looking for something light to brighten your day sometimes that is exactly what the doctor ordered.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Its a movie about shooting people in a building, that was pretty much it. The Stallone version was much better in both story and production quality. This version is very much a B movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|My friends recommended this book.  The waiting list at the library was huge.  So it had to be worthwhile, right?  So wrong.  Yes it was suspenseful, but when I got to the end the only thought I had was \\"Why did I waste my time?\\"  If you like suspense with plenty of twists and turns and don't care about the ending.  Go for it!  If you like happy endings, then I don't recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is really awesome,I really like mineing and crafting and destroying zombies,creapers,and spiders. I want you to download this app!
B005OT2YVA|3.0|I think I liked it more because I just went on the transformers ride at Universal.  I think people that played with the toys have a better connection.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|This game has been lots of fun for our whole family.  Lots of levels.  Each of them clever and different from the others.  As the game progresses you unlock more levels and move toward making the frog a prince.  Just challenging enough but doable.  Very cute graphics.  Hours of fun
B003O86FMW|4.0|I like this pineapple and those pears<br /><br />That Apple is explosive. FRUIT DISH!!<br />Tornado of light in the dark alley.<br /><br />PINEAPPLE
B009VYF5E2|5.0|The wife and I find ALL of the Seasons of MERLIN Fantastic, Well acted,written,with stories that keep you waiting for the next show and season to become available. Hope to see Merlin last for years to come.
B000000XB9|5.0|I have always loved Credence Clearwater Revival. I know all their songs well. Great sing along CD-even though I look like a fool singing in the car
B00785P2QC|3.0|Like others, the game would be much more fun if u could turn off the Facebook links. I don't think my friends and family care about the progress of my city
B00BF123WG|2.0|The whole movie feels like a sequence of disparate scenes stitched together. I had high hopes for this movie after Hurt Locker, but am disappointed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun but be careful. It's addictive! There are a lot of improvements from the old hungry shark. It now let's you start where you left off.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I likenit but it takes forever to download things and it makes an annoying noise and it wont let me download long videos and stuff
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I took my grandson's to see this about a little over a year ago.They were quiet all through it..just watching the screen.<br />The music was great:I loved it.The boys would giggle over scenes or watch seriously.We had a nice snowy afternoon<br />at the movies.I bought this for when they come over or when I want to watch it.I thought it was a cute movie for all.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Good movie, lots of action keeps you in suspense with a who dunnit and what does a lawyer do with lawyer client relationship.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I tried to play this on my Kindle Fire, I was beginning to really like playing it when it wanted to connect to my Facebook and was requiring me to have friends help.<br /><br />When I am playing a game on my Kindle I don't want to have to invite friends to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I ever played in my whole life it is VERY NEAT it's s AWESOME.  P.S:  This feedback came from my 10 year old!! ;-)
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I enjoy this game, it has you making your mind and memory work, it also times you and I like that because each time I play I try to beat the last time.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00942G4UA|4.0|it's definitely a conversation starter. the movie covers a lot of livestock/animal issues with production. but also covers topics like produce, farmers, processed foods, etc. if only farmers gave out coupons, we'd all eat healthier! alas, it's the food processors that give coupons (vs fresh produce, meats, dairy)
B000WTXCZO|5.0|hi from me to you! are you reading this review? do you need my input to decide your purchases? good! this album, i still use the word album, is amazing. if you like the jazzy fusion of jam bands, or the old blues as represented by 60's musicians, then this is the album for you. eh, just buy the album.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Excellent!!! This is true:  \\"GOOD MEN WITH GUNS ARE BETTER THEN BAD MEN WITH GUNS!!!\\" All over the world people wish they actually knew Reached.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really awesome game. There are so many extra things to do along with a look and find with elements that I haven't seen before.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|This is by far the best hi def conversion I have ever viewed. The fact that the creators went back and re-cut every second of footage is astounding. I couldn't be happier with the work they have done. And the bonus footage is spectacular.
B000P0J024|5.0|I have cassettes l and 3 that I purchased when the Traveling Wilburys were first released and was really happy when I found them on cd's.  This collection of the originals l and 3 also include two bonus songs on each one and a DVD of how the Traveling Wilburys were formed and some of the last moments with Roy Orbison before his tragic death.  I am very happy to have this since I am an avid Roy Orbison fan and miss him terribly.  Thanks so much.
1780721676|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and am part way to my goal of losing 15 pounds. This book makes losing weight easier than all the diets I've tried.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|it does not work on my phone, if I had known or if it would have said that my phone is not compatiable I would have not wasted my money
B003L77G6A|5.0|Funny show.  Very good one liners.  Not for young children.  Quirky characters, but that's what makes the show exciting and funny!!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|&#34;It's so fluffy I'm gonna die-IT'S SO FLUFFY!&#34;  I love watching this with my kids.  The characters are fresh and funny in subtle ways.  Love the mingon guys and the three girls are lovable but not too cutesy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awsome app it is good for procrastination and for passing the time by itititi it it it it
B004A2V3K0|5.0|All his hits in one place.  Great album that combines all his era's of music.  Love songs, rock, ballad, it's all here!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard that the book was about a twenty something travel experience. I work in the travel industry and read a lot of travel blogs so I thought this would be a cute story. I wasn't prepared for a page-turner that was written so well. I couldn't put it down and was amazed at what she went through. After I finished it, I went online and watched and read as many interviews with the author as I could find. What an amazing writer, amazing story.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I love birds and I have to spend endless hours watching their animated movies over and over so I wanted something different and that wasn't the same old fairytale retold and re-animated.  This has cute and colorful characters and is fun to watch
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i love this app because i can get on Twitter on my kindle fire. its great . with my recomendation you will want to get it. even better its free!!!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love the music - so much that I've seen the 10th anniversary concert, the 25th anniversary concert and the film twice each, and listened to the complete soundtrack just as many times. I loved the themes of love, redemption and grace vs. law. I loved Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. I'm usually a Russell Crowe fan but I think that Norm Lewis made a better Javert. I was also impressed with the new song \\"Suddenly\\". If you're read the book, you'll notice that the movie version is different, but that is to be expected. If you have not read the book, you can still enjoy this movie. I think it's worth the 2.5 hours!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I just loved this book from start to finish I loved travis and Abby and shep and mere I was in deep couldn't put the book down WOW well done Jamie your a genius can't wait to read walking disaster!!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, because I am old and cynical, (and all the more sentimental for that), but it really grew on me. I had expected that every time Emma Watson would say something I would be wondering: Why is Hermione talking like that? However, after a few minutes belief was suspended and I was lost in her character. I really think she did an excellent job, especially considering she must have had a childhood that was nothing like her characters, or any of ours. I have not read the book, so the hook at the end took me by surprise, in fact I was pleasently surprised several times when the story refused to conform to the mold for this genre. I was sure there would be a tragic death or two for instance, or at least an irreconciliable loss, but the ending was...hopeful, if not ecstatic. It actually evoked long buried feelings of my own adolescence when my ultimate instinctive aim was a group to shelter and nurture me, when hearing the Clash on the Radio was an occassion to jump up and down, and finding one of those very few who shared your tastes was like a ray of warm sunshine on a cold, cloudy day.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|The BBC Horizon program was great, and this book takes all that information and adds value with recipes, bibliography and FAQ's. You can see why the diet has taken off.<br />The shame is that Mosley started this process to get healthier - not less weighty, but the focus has gone to the diet.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Always a wonderful read.  Great history of France and gives one a thorough understanding of the people and the times.  Got a little lost in some of his commentaries however but most were enlightening.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book great storyline keeps you hooked and gives a great perspective on the lives of those who sacrifice and risk their lives for us.
B004N868DS|5.0|Sturdy.  Mouse tracks great, it would sometimes have trouble on wood desktop prior.<br />I like the wrist pad, some reviewers disliked, but I dig it!
B0083EM24C|1.0|Not a great second effort. This band put out an amazing EP and first record - but the quality of the second record is nowhere close. I recommend seeing them in person. But don't waste your time buying this album.
0307895475|5.0|Everything you need to know that is signifcant in this game is in this strategy guide.<br /><br />From trainers to weapons to locations its all here great stuff.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|While the Rio tie-in is unnecessary (and a little dated at this point), it's still a great, fun game, in any of its iterations.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Then my boss asked me if I would go with her so she didn't have to go alone. IT. WAS. AMAZING. What a fantastic cast, and the script was extremely well played. Having intimate knowledge of BPD, I thought they painted a pretty accurate picture of what it's like to deal with it sometimes.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love playing mahjong deluxe.  Make sure you play it with the music. It is very soothing.  I really like the scramble feature when you run out of pieces to match.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Nice season!<br />However, I didn't like the fact that it doesn't end with closure. A lot of waiting and very little happens. But if you like suspense, this is for you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The premise intrigued me.  Her husband is the actor who was Mr Big on Sex in the City.  The characters are believable and the writing is very good.  It's especially nice to watch on my KINDLE because of Prime membership...which excludes all the commercials!!  Thank you PRIME.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book arrived in very nice condition allowing me to read the series in coordination with its broadcast on tv. Happy with the transaction.
0684857219|5.0|Great book.  Very informative and has every detail you would care to know in bodybuilding.  After reading it I now realize most of the other books take all of there information from book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book arrived in very nice condition allowing me to read the series in coordination with its broadcast on tv. Happy with the transaction.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|This was a very dim recording.  Not sharp at all.  I have an LCD flat screen TV and the other two movies were fine but this one was very poor.
0756697875|5.0|Just makes you want the things that are no longer available.  Have to use imagination more in the building process
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is very different & dark from the original movie.  But very well-done and somewhat scary. The Queen is played by  Jean Marsh is wicked to the core & deicicious in the role!  May be somewhat frightning for very young children to watch some of the characters.
B003VTZTU8|2.0|The subject showed promise but I found it repetitive and to a certain extent patronizing. Abandoned the book after reading 60%. Maybe one day I will finish.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Who can't fall in love with Emma Thompson in this updated Mary Poppins type of story, which also shares some moralistic stories for young & old.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Are you kidding?  Since the first episode I have fallen in love with all things Downton Abbey.  The characters are remarkable.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I am a long time fan of the authors - I used to pass out copies of their [[ASIN:B002BWQBEE The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps]] like some people hand out bible tracts. [[ASIN:B00AZRBLHO The Phoenix Project]] goes beyond their previous work in that it is not only that useful to the point of essential for anyone who thinks of themselves as a computing professional, it is fun and interesting to read. I didn't want to put it down to go to bed, because I had to find out what happened next.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AZRBLHO The Phoenix Project]] should be required reading in beginning programming classes because it shows the best and worst cases of many types of computing careers in the 'real world' as well as why a number of things that don't make a lot of sense in the classroom, are important for real projects (like automation and testing.) More than that, I'm planning to send my mom a copy, because I never have managed to explain to her exactly what it is that I do before boring her past the point of comprehending anything.<br /><br />There was one thing that I felt was missing from the book. I kept waiting for the scene where the protagonists discover that many of the lessons they learned the hard way had been in practice in old-school mainframe shops for decades, much like they learned how factory production processes applied to them. This in no way detracts from the book (unless, perhaps you are an old mainframe hand, in which case you will likely find the book to be high comedy, but actually useful in persuading people to let you do the things that work they way you always have. Also, I salute you!)
B00992CF6W|3.0|Thai game is ok not something that I will be addicted to. Xbox 360 and ps3 is better for minecraft. I didn't give it four or five stars because it doesn't have survival in it and because it doesn't have all the tools.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|After reading some 5 star rated $5 novels on the Kindle store I have been more and more reluctant to pick up the more expensive novels. Thank goodness I did with this. Joe Ambercrombe is a wonderful writer. His dialogue, pacing and characters are a step about the dime novels in the online ebook stores now days. Joe is a seriously skilled writer and I will pick up anything he puts out again in the future.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used a lot of keyboards and this is the best by far.  You can swipe, tap, or talk to text.  You don't have to change the language to text in different languages.  So I can type spanglish smoothly.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This was a fun ride into a really scary place,  I enjoyed turning  page after page, I want more it will leave you wanting more!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Disagree with multitudes of &#34;thumbs downers&#34;. Enjoyed this movie. Creative violence, great cast, and original settings. Pure chaotic indulgence...lighten up.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really awesome book. I can't wait for the next one. \\"The House of Hades\\" sounds like it as gonna be epic!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great deal. Great movie, and the Ultraviolet version is something that's been needed for a long time. Pleased with the purchase.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|If you don't have the money, buy the Free Version. There's not much of a difference. It teaches so well I can play For Elise by Beethoven perfectly! I've always wanted a piano and this is the closest I can get! Please buy if you love pianos!
B002VE5472|4.0|This isn't the best movie, by any means. However, I love watching everything from the lush scenery, to the awesome cat and mouse play at the end.
B0086700CM|3.0|i like this game but it run a little fast but it is a good game i play it all the time
B00270WH3Y|5.0|If you are a Simon and Garfunkel fan, this is the album for you!  All of the classics are here, many of them live versions.  Can't miss for any fan!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've played, in a list that includes games<br />Like temple run, (1 and 2), plants vs. Zombies, and doodle jump, it's a<br />Great game. Bravo
0446576220|4.0|This book contains interesting examples of corporate culture and entrepreneurship. The company pursued a balance between unique culture and an operational efficiency model of rapid response to customer needs through mail order, seeking to promote their culture outward and delivering \\"WOW\\" to its customers.<br />A fun, honest, entertaining read, which defies the average business norms. Considering Hsieh was able to sell the business to Amazon for over $1billion, a very unique success story.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|A must have have for anyone's collection. I'm not sure if you need to upgrade to the Blu-Ray if you already own this though.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Absolutely love this game & I am so glad to have it on the kindle. Very fast paced. I like that you can get higher scores by playing on the kindle as well
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been over 10 years since Killswitch Engage released their genre-defining classic, Alive or Just Breathing.  Original vocalist Jesse Leach left the band following said album, and the band continued on with vocalist Howard Jones for the next 9 years and 3 releases (it's been 4 years since the 2nd self-titled release!).  My own interest in the band seemed to wane after The End of Heartache as the band's material seemed to be getting stagnant and slightly more mellow.  When news broke in early 2012 that Howard would be leaving the band and the subsequent news of Leach's return, I couldn't help but be excited for what lied ahead for the band.  After all, Jesse collaborated with Adam D. the year prior with the excellent Times of Grace.  So, along with undoubtably many others in the metal community, this became one of my most hotly anticipated titles of 2013.<br /><br />So how does it hold up to expectations?  Provided you are not expecting Alive or Just Breathing Part 2, both old and new fans of KsE should find plenty to enjoy here.  As I had hoped, the return of Jesse Leach to the band has invigorated them.  As I previously mentioned, my own interest in the band had declined to the point of listening to the self titled disc #2 just a few times before I was bored with it.  The band seemed to be stuck in a songwriting rut.  The riffs were stale, with cookie-cutter choruses that seemed lifeless and uninspired.  As I listen to Disarm the Descent, I don't get that same feeling.  2013 Killswitch Engage is firing on all cylinders once again!  Much like Soilwork's recent opener, \\"Spectrum of Eternity\\", opening track \\"The Hell in Me\\" will undoubtably take many aback with it's heavier than expected introduction.  This heavier tone maintains for much of the album, flexing a muscle that we haven't seen from the band since AoJB.  Some of this stems from Leach's more abrasive and visceral approach (which has held up quite well over time) but that would be aninjustice to the riff output on Disarm the Descent.  I hear that classic Killswitch guitar tone and lush melodies (\\"No End in Sight\\") but played with more fever.  \\"Beyond the Flames\\" certainly flirts with melodic death metal in it's playfulness, \\"A Tribute to the Fallen\\" will suck you in with the addictiveness of the choral riff, and the Iron Maiden-esque gallop of \\"You Don't Bleed for Me\\" will put a smile on many faces.  The thrashy and frentic pace of tracks like \\"New Awakening\\", \\"All That We Have\\", and \\"The Call\\" will be hard pressed to not pull older fans back to the fold.  They even tossed in a number of short solos as well, most notably with \\"The Turning Point\\" and \\"A Tribute to the Fallen\\", which makes me wonder why they've hid them away in so many past releases.  If there is one weak point, it's the length of the tracks, which for the most part stick in that 3-4 minute arrangement and I would love to hear some of these tracke elaborated a bit just to hear them a bit longer (leave 'em wanting more I suppose).<br /><br />While this is more of a riff-monster of an album than the last record, Leach also elevates it with his return.  I've always felt his vocals were a bit more aggressive than Howard's, and he meshes with the sound of Disarm the Descent to the point where you'd never realized he had left the band.  His positive lyrics are always a refreshing change of pace from my usual dosage of the standard 'doom and gloom' metal lyrics and this release is no exception.  One new addition to the table (clearly taken from Times of Grace) is the harmonization of Leach and Dutkiewicz in the choruses.  I absolutely love the way their vocals mesh, and it makes for some exceptional choruses (see \\"Beyond the Flames\\", \\"Always\\", \\"Time Will Not Remain\\" for the best examples).  I found the standard 'mellow' song \\"Always\\" to be their most compelling since \\"My Last Serenade\\", with slightly cliche-yet-touching lyrics and striking chorus.  Leach's work on the anthemic closing \\"Time Will Not Remain\\" will almost certainly become a live staple, with his lyrics and vocal delivery at their peak.<br /><br />It's hard not to be excited listening to Disarm the Descent.  I didn't realize how much I had missed this band from my rotating playlist.  While it will not leave the same lasting mark on the metal community as AoJB, it's a more than suitable spiritual successor.  Welcome back Jesse!
B00594XOZU|4.0|When I decided to get the app, I thought it'd cost money, but COMPLETELY FREE!! The texts, membership, and the app itself! It is so easy to use, and a great texting app, probably the best ones you could find in the app store. Although, I find it not helpful to get usernames and friends. To find friends you can't search their full name, you have to find their usernames, which is sometimes random words and numbers, which is really hard. Besides that, WOW! Either get your first and last texting app, or switch your old texting app to kik messenger now!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|I received this blu-ray at just the right time. I hit not one, but two cars in a parking lot near my house and received a notice from my insurance company about their &#34;On Your Side Repair Program&#34;, which is pure fantasy, and yes, surrealistic. The body shop guy didn't show up to tow my car. And when I went to my house, two men were taking my house apart and left with all the water turned off. After viewing The Game, I realized that all my problems were minor compared to those of Investment Banker Nicholas van Orton (aka Michael Douglas) of San Francisco, who lost 600 million dollars in his investment accounts. If you don't know San Francisco, we see a sign for Sansome Street, which is in the financial district, followed by a shot of Lombard Street, well known as the most crooked street in the US. Then his world begins to crumble. The song White Rabbit by Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane at the end of the film was totally appropriate, and yes, surrealistic.<br />If you're not familiar with surrealism, it was a big movement in Europe in art and literature during the last century. If you saw the painting of limp watches by Salvador Dali, it was surrealistic.<br />I love the movies by David Fincher, because they are intelligent and do not look like all the movies out there. No reviewer is likely to call his movies AWESOME. They go way beyond awesome.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book and exciting.<br />I liked it a lot and wish that there were more diary of a wimpy kid books
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Protagonist's rabid belief in his son was unbelievable, sloppy and contrived ending which was also unbelievable - this COULD have.been a great book
0679729895|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying these stories. I read all his children's books when I was younger, and was introduced to his adult work with &#34;My Uncle Oswald&#34; which I loved. These do not disappoint.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I wanted a solitaire game for my Android phone.  I searched the Amazon app store, sorted by customer review, and downloaded the top app.  Installed and opened app.  Read directions and changed settings to my liking.  Started my first game.  Before I could make even one move a full-screen ad for a dating site appeared.  The **ONLY** way to make it go away (other than rebooting my phone, I suppose) was by clicking on the ad.  I clicked on the ad, immediately backed out to my home screen and immediately uninstalled the app.  Since it was the top rated solitaire app, I went to the MobilityWare web site to see if there was an ad-free version that I could purchase.  There isn't.  The web site simply states that if you cannot live with the ads you should uninstall the app and get a different one from someone else.  Making and selling an ad-free version isn't that hard, so that tells me a lot about MobilityWare as a company and their regard for their users.  No sense having anything to do with them.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have a problem with ear buds not staying in and hurting my ears.  These headphones are lightweight and so comfy in my ears.  The sound quality on my runs is also quite good.  Very happy with this purchase.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|&#60;More real folk than Mumfords..Received on time and in good shape. Plus, the music was excellent. Already looking forward to their next album.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|If you only know Clutch from Robot Hive/Exodus forward, you may be a little dismayed by this album.  Gone are the more bluesier numbers from the last 3 albums.  This one is all about the ROCK!  Very similar to their earlier stuff in that regard.  If you couple this with the Pigtown Blues single, it is one of the best Clutch albums in years.  Great stuff from a great band.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This was an incredible movie, incredibly moving, incredibly thoughtful, film.  The initial images of the dancers, so intriguing.  I am in awe. I struggled through the factory farming, factory production, factory trash, pieces, but it touched me in a way that no essay could.  I am humbled.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really enjoyed the previous two seasons and had high hopes for season three.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good however I fear the show is getting a bit too &#34;soap opera&#34; like when it comes to the bits of sappier drama.  I am anticipating the start of season four and look forward to bringing back the edginess we have come to expect.

B00AEFYRVO|5.0|I saw this movie a bunch of times when it came out, but I forgot how funny it was.  I don't think that good comedies come around that often, but this movie is so funny, again and again.
6305212112|5.0|I really was pleased with my purchase because I knew this was exactly what I wanted. I've had back surgery and enjoying movies while recovering has been a true Godsend for me. So, I treated myself to a few good oldies but goodies and I've been extremely happy with my purchase. Now I can watch this anytime I have the desire and I don't have to ever miss out on a good, clean, funny and top cast movie. If you are just wanting a movie to fill a couple of hours and make you laugh and cry, then this movie is a must have!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I actually teetered between three and four stars with this book, but I ended up going with four because of how amazingly detailed Walter Isaacson unfolded the life of one of the greatest entrepreneurs ever.  That's not to say you're gonna end up loving everything about Steve Jobs after you read this book, but you'll get a lot of detail you would have never known.  Unfortunately, the detail in the book is exactly one of the reasons why it is sometimes a bit boring to read.  The details end up being the same throughout the book.. just reiterated in different ways for paragraph after paragraph of endless monotony.<br />I do recommend this book though.  It's a good read.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a great book that simplifies the editing and publishing process detailed in the Kindle Publishing Guidelines.  Following the steps leads to a book that is ready to publish. Screen shots and images help with the steps, too.
B001HM1PFO|1.0|I paid for this last night so my sister could watch it.  Her grand-daughter has been selected for a stage production in Houston playing the part of COLUMBIA.  Since she has never seen this, I thought she may need to preview it so she wouldn't be too shocked at the stage production.<br /><br />To my utter disappointment (and disgust) the download of Rocky Horror looked like a illegal video copy of a movie taken in a theater and audio recording with a pocket cassette tape recorder.<br /><br />MAYBE a DVD copy is better, but after this experience .....
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|As others have noted, Bryan Ferry may have been born a few decades too late. There is little doubt that he finds the music of the jazz age deeply inspirational. Bryan has been covering songs from the jazz era since the 1970s. Just listen to his gorgeous covers of \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\\" and \\"These Foolish Things\\". Mr. Ferry's solo offering \\"As Time Goes By\\" successfully explored much loved songs from the golden age of the big bands. I was fortunate to catch his show supporting that release at a small venue in Philadelphia the night before he played The Beacon Theater in Manhattan. I can truthfully say that show was a transcendent experience.<br /><br />I have been a Roxy Music fan since college and greatly enjoy much of Bryan Ferry's solo material. I was lucky to see him perform with Roxy Music and as a solo performer at Radio City Music Hall among other venues. Songs like \\"Slave To Love\\" and \\"Love Is The Drug\\", both included on \\"The Jazz Age\\", are among my all time favorites.<br /><br />I knew I was taking a chance when I purchased \\"The Jazz Age\\". It was obviously an experiment that took Mr. Ferry far from his usual track much as the recent release \\"Apres\\" did for Iggy Pop. Certainly the record sounds extremely authentic. It could easily have been recorded during the era that inspired it. Mr. Ferry's songs have been remade and remodeled to sound like creations right out of the Jazz Age. To that extent the experiment is an unqualified success. Unfortunately the structure of the songs change so much they are barely recognizable. That might have been OK if only he had actually sung them! Where oh where is Mr. Ferry's beautiful baritone voice?  He is one of greatest rock crooners of all time. To make a CD like this without any vocals seems like a missed opportunity to me.<br /><br />\\"The Jazz Age\\" is an intriguing experiment. Perhaps it will grow on me. I strongly suspect, however, that it will languish in my collection rarely listened to. Bryan Ferry is nothing lessthan a ground breaking pioneer who has made tremendous contributions to popular music. With so many home runs behind him it's OK to hit a double once in awhile. Anyway kudos to Mr. Ferry for trying something completely different.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so good!  I couldn't stop playing it.  totally get this app.  you wont regret it. LOL. they should make a temple run 3. I would pay 5 bucks for it.
B000001GF9|5.0|Such as I am, I'm intrinsically suspicious of Lenny. There's too much Mahler in his DNA, let alone all that show-tunes stuff. In an unguarded moment, I once heard his Mass: disconsolate and obstreperous, I almost abjured my affiliations to become a nihilist under arms with the Symbionese Liberation Army. Patty Hearst, here I come!<br /><br />What of this disc? I have resisted it for so long. As I hear it, there's no foppery here. Radical chic is likewise absent. Nor did the Black Panthers make an appearance. Indeed, I was captivated from beginning to end.<br /><br />Lenny's K618 lacks the inflexions of Colin Davis's account from 1971 but the simplicity of Ave Verum Corpus arguably warrants such an approach.<br /><br />Considering she was fifty at the time, Arleen Auger sings with amazing freshness in K 165 and the Mass itself - and on the evidence of 11'10\\" of Exsultate Jubilate she can still soar into the stratosphere. Her embellishments are tasteful. This is enjoyable. For all Auger's merits, however, she does not displace [[ASIN:B00000E47W Mozart: Exsultate Jubilate]] in my allegiances where the Dutch soprano clearly has a younger voice with more sparkle.<br /><br />To the Mass. Syncretism is regnant here which is fine by me: this is a religious work which happens to be the Roman Rite. The Qui Tollis for instance, stupendously played, addresses Golgotha and Yom Kippur equally. Lenny conducts with exuberance and acuity. Joy illuminates the Gloria and opening of the Credo as well it should. The great invocation which is the Iesu Christe, followed by the fugal `Cum Sanctu Spiritu' are grandly but not grandiloquently rendered. The soloists acquit themselves, even if the tenor sounds dangerously like the baritone and none too agreeably at that.<br /><br />Weighty forces, both orchestral and choral, are in play. Lenny's musicianship averts them from congealing into soup. Speaking of which, as my buddy DV_F observes, Lenny's K 427 is more naturally balanced than Karajan: an organ there is! It's also more spring-heeled in comparison and advantageously so.<br /><br />First impressions count. My introit into Mozart all those years ago was [[ASIN:B000THKCR0 Mozart: Mass in C minor, K.427]] with the great Cotrubas. It has been a lodestar through the years. As such, I find it arduous to be semi-objective towards `intruders'. As always, it comes down to the Kyrie. Akin to Abraham, one senses that Cotrubas is actually pleading with the Almighty not to destroy Sodom on account of the one good man in the city. It eludes me here.<br /><br />This is a welcome riposte to the likes of Jeggy and Corporal Hogwood. In Hoc Signo - by this sign you shall conquer.: an organ there is!

B005IQZB14|4.0|This book is so much more than a story about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  It is about coming of age, discovering what is important in our lives, a daughter's love for her mother, and finally learning to let go.  A great read!
0140067477|5.0|This is a cute and simple book on Taoism. Much wisdom can be learned from reading this little book. Something to be cherished and reviewed over!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was my favorite book growing up but now it's my son's. We read this book over and over again.
0345529057|5.0|The books were new & in excellent condition. I also bought Book 5. I am totally hooked by the series, but now, almost done with Book 5, I am burning out on violence & betrayal -- & frustrated with no end in sight. I've heard 2014 as a release date for Book 6, but nothing is definite -- & how many years then before the final Book 7?! I know life is like that.... it doesn't wrap up neatly in the next couple of months -- but I want to know what happens tio characters I've come to care about -- positively or negatively. Book 5 drags a bit more than the others. Interesting characterizations, but less actually happening. I also bought Season 1 of the HBO series. Probably won't buy more, but it was interesting to see how they personified the characters. Most were quite good -- especially Tyrion & Arya.
B00543R3WG|5.0|My hubby loves it! It's great to have all the Harry Potter movies in one nice set. The price was right, too.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Soilwork continues to impress with each album they produce. From Steelbath Suicide to the latest The Living Infinite, each album has gotten better and better, which in my opinion is rare for a band to complete that feat. What's even more impressive to me, the latest album is a Double Album!! What more can the melodic metal world ask for than yet another awesome production from Soilwork. If you haven't seen them live, I highly suggest you attend one of their shows when they come in your area!! I love latest double album! To me it carries the raw power from the last album The Panic Broadcast straight into the first few tunes and persists right into the waning moments of the second of the double release!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|would highly recommend , the book is much beter than the movie , must read to get better understanding of movie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Okay so it left me hanging.....after being addicted, the shortest time period i read a book in. Everyone have to read this book.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|Read for myself then again for bookclub.  Everyone will get something from this story.  Enduring.  Could read<br />again and still find something else new from it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's book is a very good account of his NDE from his well trained scientist's viewpoint.  His main purpose is to refute his own formerly naturalistic notion that NDEs were purely a physical phenomenon.  The book covers all the criticisms of the biological/chemical explanations for his experience, woven in with the personal joys and difficulties after recovering from his coma.  I am disappointed that so many people refuse to accept his account on purely philosophical grounds.  One review by a (perhaps well intentioned) evangelical Christian offered no basis for her unfavorable review other than that it did not conform to the orthodox understanding of the Bible.  While I respect her devotion to the Bible, we are dealing in the real world that is also a part of God's direct expression.  Don't be hasty with the sifting of the evidence.
098555780X|5.0|i got this book to guide me along and give me some ideals .. it does both. i have already made about 3 or 4 different type bracelets from this book. Easy and fun

B004LROUNG|5.0|Brilliant. Compelling. Genius, John, Genius. The Litigators holds the same depth of legal maneuvering and provocative characters we have come to expect from John Grisham, but here he adds a good taste of delightful WIT! How about a dozen more of these, Counselor?
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|I've always loved Bonobo, and more specifically Simon Green for his incredible musical sense in creating some of the best down-tempo trip hop I've ever heard.  Not only will this music exercise your speakers, but it will captivate your mind.  I'm astonished at how every time I listen to Bonobo I feel like I'm discovering something new, and for the most part that is the case here.<br /><br />As I listen to \\"North Borders\\" I don't feel as if the tone or style of the album is anything new when referenced to past work, but it maintains the same brilliance that made me such a fan in the first place.  So to some extent, this can be attributed to the past success of Bonobo...which you really can't fault.<br /><br />The album as a whole is somewhat more laid back than past work, with slightly more atmospheric passages, and the music seems to transcend mood for me, as I can easily listen to it when I'm trying to get work done or just want to jam out.  The lyrics as usual for Bonobo are sparse, reflective and well placed.<br /><br />This album is worth a complete purchase, but if looking fora few \\"best of\\" tracks go for:<br /><br />\\"Towers,\\"  Awesome lyrical song, nice downtempo rhythm with syncopated synths throughout, builds for an excellent 3+ minutes.<br /><br />\\"Ten Tigers,\\" Typewriter sounds, deep bass, forward keys and harp throughout.  Chill and remorseful.  One of my favorite instrumentals here.<br /><br />\\"Jets,\\"  Uses the female vocal as part of the song and rhythm.  A great get down track with soul.<br /><br />\\"Heaven for the Sinner,\\" Nice female vocal, builds throughout by adding pieces to the track.  Layered nicely with nice frenetic yet chill spacing.<br /><br />\\"Pieces,\\"  Cinematic, layered and harmonizing vocal rhythm along with frontal vocals, strings and great forward moving beat.  Really really cool track.<br /><br />As usual an amazing album, very cohesive when listened to as a whole, Down-Tempo Trip Hop doesn't get any better than Bonobo.  4.5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game to play for all ages!  I would advise to get this game and make sure to get the upgrades to make it even better
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|So, I'm giving this album my first listen as I write this. All I can think is \\"They rock so HARD!\\" I didn't know Howard had left, but I'm certainly not disappointed with Jesse on lead vocals (I ordered this as soon as I saw it was coming out via pre-order, no questions asked). Metal as it was meant to be. Chugging guitar that transitions flawlessly to hammer-on thrash, uptempo tracks abound, and the positive lyrics KSE is famous for, with good old scream-o and harmonic vocals perfectly balanced. I like to listen to KSE while I work out, and this will certainly be a welcome addition to that playlist.
1594487154|5.0|I was worried about purchasing this book. How would it stack up against his others that I had found so useful? I am an avid fan of `A whole new mind' and `Drive'. How could an author keep up the surprise and relevance of his material for a third time? I shouldn't have worried. As soon as I opened the first page I was `hooked' into Pinks usual easy and humorous style. He has an extraordinary ability to translate research into everyday language and use well known material to describe a new emerging paradigm that has relevance at the moment.<br /><br />In the first part, setting the scene, Pink explains why sales have been particularly affected by the internet. \\"In a world where anybody can find anything with just a few keystrokes, intermediaries like salespeople are superfluous. Individual consumers can do their own research and get buying advice from their social networks. Large companies can streamline their procurement processes with sophisticated software that pits vendors against one another and secures the lowest price\\".<br /><br />He does not claim that the era of sales is over, but that it has fundamentally changed from `Caveat Emptor' to `Caveat Venditor'. The buyer now has the upper hand with all the information and the power of referrals through social networks. The world of work is also shifting from large corporate employers to smaller businesses and sole traders and there will be an enormous boost in the number of jobs in the education and medical sectors in the next decade and beyond. In itself, this is creating a need for adopting a different approach to selling service as well as products.<br /><br />In the next part, Pink outlines an approach to `being' and `doing' in this new environment. His A, B and C's of what we need to be are Attuned, Buoyant and Clear. Each of these is described with good exercises to practice `becoming' in these three areas. I found it a little confusing that the sample cases at the end of each subject chapter were also examples of things to practice. Being is about approaching other people differently; changing our thinking about others.<br /><br />In the third part Pink talks about actions that underpin success; a framework for developing practical techniques. These are techniques that will eventually lead to becoming better at the ABC of selling. (we become what we regularly do). He covers Pitch (create initial and lasting impact), Improvise (be adaptable and empathetic) and serve (link personal awareness with greater purpose). These ideas are not new but when brought together they make good sense and underpin the books purpose beautifully. More good exercises.<br /><br />I can understand the sales people who found this book disappointing. It is not a sales manual in the traditional sense - more a guide to changing approach. It would, as he suggests, be relevant to any area of life where persuasion is needed. That is the point. Sellers no longer have the informational power to pull the wool over anyone's eyes; there are no special sales techniques - just human methods for influencing others. I also understand that the reviewer from IBM might find it no better than their very expensive in house training. IBM should be well ahead with this knowledge and be teaching it to all their sales people if they are to survive - but will they be called sales people?<br /><br />I shall use the ideas and techniques in this book. We all sell every day, but to leave you with Pinks final test for selling, which I love:  ask yourself<br /><br />1. If the person you are selling to agrees to buy, will his or her life improve?<br />2. When your interaction is over, will the world be a better place than when you began?les of things to practice.

B00002ND77|5.0|No one could have done it better. A great feel and a positive revelation of historcal fact. If you don't like reading, this DVD does it for you and presents it as it was. How can you go wrong with a creative director like Spike Lee. Rock on Mr. Lee.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|A lot of stupid stuff makes you say what's next. Lets see, to make it 10 words. I liked the Tiger and I give him 5 stars.
145552347X|5.0|This was a purchase for someone going through chemo who wanted an intelligent, provocative look at the journey. She is enjoying it.
1881273156|5.0|This book helps you to identify your spouses needs as well as your own.  This is not clinical or technical book rather it is basic essential information that is a must have for all relationships.  I appreciated how the author incorporated Bible scriptures appropriately and wasn't overbearing with his own thoughts.  There are several experiences that most people can relate to and the changes that helped them work out their differences.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A good movie. I can highly recommend it. Good performance of Ben Affleck and all the other actors.  Enjoy it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have always loved this show.  It was beyond ground breaking.  The restoration looks great except for one part.  The exterior shots of the Enterprise have all been recreated in computer graphics.  They may be frame for frame recreations but it is jarring when they appear.  So many things about this show are 60s television.  The HD upgrade reveals the hand sewn uniforms, cardboard sets and heavy makeup jobs.  Then all of the sudden, when I expected to see the model of the Enterprise hanging from a wire circling a blurry planet I get a 3D computer generated Enterprise circling a highly detailed planet with clouds and mountains.  I wish they would have just cleaned up the old special effects instead of remaking them.<br />Other than that, the restoration makes the show come alive.  A lot of effort was put into the original production of this show to make it a vision of the future with hope and adventure even if they had to do it on a shoestring budget.
B0060MYKTY|1.0|Lors de mon achat le descriptif de la série Les Borgia saison 2, il est mentionné qu'il y a une traduction en français mais sur le Blue-ray que je viens de recevoir la traduction est en espagnol et il n'y a même pas de traduction française ni même de sous-titre en français. Donc je suis très déçu. When I made the purchase of The Borgia season 2 in Blue-ray it was specified in the description, we supposed have a french version. But when I receive my Blue-ray disc, he was just in english version and spanish version. And we have no subtitle in french to. So Im very disapointed.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|If you are a fan of Josh Groban, you will love this CD. The songs on this CD are trending more toward &#34;pop-music&#34;, which is different for Josh. However, his voice is still unmistakeably his and as always, a joy to listen to.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I do this for hours most evenings, and I love it.  Sometimes seems like there is someone playing against me.
B002W7J3SO|1.0|i chose this rating to reflect the poor technical quality provided using amazon video streaming via google tv and not a review of the movie per se.  this was my first and last attempt for a while with amazon video.  i use netflix daily and can report amazon is not even close to netflix in providing continuous uninterrupted video streaming.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This CPU works great--but the stock cooler and fan that came with it are LOUD--I had no choice but to purchase an after market, super quiet cooling unit. That is not the sellers fault, AMD should have known better than to put out a cooling unit with such a noise problem.<br /><br />I run Pro Tools 8.04 in a home recording environment. I may be running as many as 30 to 40 simultaneous tracks at any given time. I have had very few latency issues, drag, lag etc...certainly fewer than I had before. To me, this processor is fast, but it is more about &#34;muscle&#34; than speed.<br /><br />I bought this to improve on my older , slower Ghz quad-core. This does a fine job without exceeding Pro Tools current capabilities--Avid , the company that makes Pro Tools, tends to run WAY behind the rest of the computer world.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Wanted to know more about the author after I read about his murder at a Texas gun range. While the book serves this purpose the incessant chest thumping detracts from the read and over shadows the bravery and patriotism of Chris Kyle. If you are looking for any meaningful insight into the structure or hierarchy of the SEALs  you will be disappointed. Still I am glad I read his book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very well written and very interesting format. If you're looking for book that will keep your attention this is it.
B005DI66N4|5.0|I read this book a long time ago, and had lost my copy.  Thank you for offering it on Kindle.  This is a tale which will keep you in suspense till the very end of the book.  It is a story of human perseverance and sacrifice to gain freedom.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, likely for the 3rd or 4th time!
B005I548B4|4.0|Nicholas Sparks have a unique writing style that keep you in suspense and difficult to predict. The moment you think this is going to happen he introduced a new angle. Some of the other writers can describe the same insedent in so many different ways and one get frustrated because their is no progress or that the writer maybe  think the readers are ignorant. With Nicholas es books their is progress, and  suspense.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|It wasn't too bad, just took a long time to get to the point. There was a good suspense to it. I am always the person who pulls the shirt up over my eyes, and I did this quite a bit during this movie. I would watch it again.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book is amazing. I spent literally the whole entire night reading this book. I just couldn't stop! The characters in this book reveal their true colors and the truth is unveiled. This book isn't just something you pass by. If you consider buying this book. Get it!
B00BESM14U|3.0|I would watch this again. It was a a sweet story. Easy to love all the characters and see them over come what ever was thrown at them.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I'm not going to rehash the plot or many of the points made by other reviewers...you can read those reviews. This is just a short note to say that I really enjoyed this book. Even though I could see (more or less...but not for sure) where things were leading, I found myself on the edge of my seat wondering how things would turn out. Edge-of-my seat is possibly the wrong phrasing...I had an uneasy feeling throughout that only heightened as I neared the end.<br /><br />Very few books keep me that engaged.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I like this book there was sad moments but then very surprising moments, and in the end it makes you want to read the next book.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I was surprised at how closely the movie followed the book.......there are usually 'misses' when a book translates into a film.  This was wonderful and since much of it was filmed in North Carolina and I live here, it was especially interesting.  Can't  go wrong when buying this DVD.....I'm anxiously waiting for the next one to come along!
B00742GBDM|5.0|Like many Jane Austen tales, this story is compelling and sweet when brought to the big screen.  It made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Perfect for a date night.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was entertaining, enjoyable and kept me locked the whole way through... but it was definitely Hollywood and just didn't have the depth that I think an Oscar winner deserves.<br /><br />Nevertheless, very worthwhile the time spent watching it.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My boys (preschool and elementary age) love this series of stories.  My youngest loves the female sabertooth, and both boys roll with laughter at the antics of the entire crew.  The morals in the story are strong and opened up some good opportunities to talk to my boys about how families stick together no matter what and about how to deal with peer pressure as they get older.  Lots of laughs for grown ups too.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|For the true DM fan, Black Celebration is the best of the best.  Delta Machine is the new Black Celebration.  It was clearly made for the fans...and that is what makes this cd so amazing!  Every track is dark, brooding, and awesome.  I've listened to it for three days now and it grows better with every listen.  I recommend that you buy the deluxe edition with the four extra tracks.  They will probably be released as b-sides with the singles that are released.  Get it now!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Another successful release of Angry Birds that entrances you, numbs your brain, and sucks the hours away if you don't pay close attention.  I love the way you have to consider gravity in this version, enabling cool &#34;trick shots&#34; not possible in other versions.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|This was made for the kindle fire HD and it s awful.Drawing is near impossible you have to press hard for it to make a consistent line. It's ok if I just want to point, but that's not why I bought it.There's other stylus that come in a three pack with lanyards and extra tips and a cleaning cloth that perform much better. Really disappointed .
B0095P29EG|4.0|Unlike a lot of what's out there, I can watch this with my two young boys.  The characters help me teach my boys good life lessons and give me larger than life examples of some values we'd like them to emulate, like loyalty, humility after failing, the pitfalls of pride, and the strength it takes to get back on one's feet.  There is a good bit of fighting, which we try to limit our kids' access to, but on the whole of it, the fighting scenes are pretty tame with none of the blood and gore present in many other films.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have watched this season 6 times and as a matter of fact all the seasons I have I watch all the time.<br /> I'm afaid I am addicted to Castle<br />Best series ever and heard yesterday that they have renewed it for season 6<br />I am in my glory
B002L3ARRU|5.0|How can you not love one of the biggest iconic films of the 1980s?  Even if you aren't a child of the '80s, you have to watch this to understand a lot of the catch phrases that have worked their way into American culture.  &#34;Bueller......Bueller......Bueller.&#34;
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addictive. I quite playing it when the ads started popping up so much but the grand kids play it often.  They are ad immune I think.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Fantastic woman pianist heading this fine jazz quartette. She is a great interpreter of a song with her voice and a rare talent.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|It has the old games on it but they seem to have lost their fascination for him.  We don't play with it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Chapters have in same story line. One can always predict what will happen at the end. Hope the others have more excitement
B002VISNBC|5.0|One of the best children's books ever written. The illustrations from Quentin are perfect and Roald Dahl was a writing genius.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many great ideas, beautiful places and fun things!<br />I always have a good time being on this site.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|wonderful app.  loads slow at times.  otherwise super calculator.  keep up the good work.  just please fix the slow loading issue.  thank you.
B001LMAK88|5.0|One of my favorite Westerns. If you like Western movies, I highly recommend Silverado. Has several plots going at the same time to keep your interest. Filmed in New Mexico.
0425263908|5.0|As far as the seller I rate them 5 Stars and fast shipping. But as far as the writer goes, well it seems in just one book she took all the good parts out of Fifty Shades of Grey; changed the names and a few other things. It was like reading 50 Shades of Gray all over again. Very disappointing .
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This movie is a miracle, it successfully revives Star Trek and it's original characters with new actors and stories in the form of a prequel.  Chris Pine is James T. Kirk a wild young man who is training in Star Fleet Command, ditto a Vulcan named Spock.  There is a linguist named Uhura who attracts Kirk but loves Spock.  A doctor nicknamed Bones and stumbled upon is an engineer named Scotty.  Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as the elder Spock from the future and Vulcan is distroyed.  Destiny is Kirk as captain and Spock as first mate apparently.  Good movie. Watched Superman Returns recently and it was a great disappointment and chose the wrong actors.  This movie gets a reboot right!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Do yourself a favor and read Marine Sniper by Carlos Hathcock first. Hathcock was the greatest sniper of all time and his stories of stalking and taking out targets in VietNam is riveting and frankly a much better read than American Sniper. After I read Marine Sniper I read Kyle's book and was frankly disappointed. He isn't a very likable person either in his attitude or his relationships with his superiors, colleagues or wife. That's not the main reason I gave it 3 stars (barely). It just doesn't hold a candle to the Hathcock book,
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Show is filled with action, interesting story and interesting characters that are real life situations in today's world.  I would suggest to others
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book that I can't wait to discuss with my book club. The manipulation that takes place in this marriage will end up making you feel pretty good about your own!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|this is so far the best antivirus free that i could find. it protect the tablet for all kid of virus. it is excelent.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I've seen all of the movies at the theater and on TV, DVD, etc.  I'm pleased with this set.  I read all of the reviews for other sets that get really picky about extras and UK versions, etc.  I have no complaints.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I play for 4 min. and it seems a litlle dificult for kids ( age 4-8) you need to try to not let the train crash. that is is./
0545123275|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. The story line is  intriguing and I just can't seem to put it down. I SO be getting the rest of the series!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Walk around and find 8 pages before some stick man 'catches' you.....<br />Fight him off with, oh wait, you cannot do anything except run, doesn't even do that just goes at the same pace<br />No game is the same as each time the location of the pages changes,  oooooohhhh.<br />Oh so so so boring<br />Pointless game just glad I didn't actually pay for it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Excelente libro el cual recomiendo lean y compartan con sus amistades. Esta lleno de muchas cosas interesantes para el conocimiento de todos.
B00991TCOG|4.0|I enjoy Lindsey's YouTube videos and it was fun to get her music.  It is my hope that younger musicians will see the value of learning classical instruments and see all the various things that can be done.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Excelente libro el cual recomiendo lean y compartan con sus amistades. Esta lleno de muchas cosas interesantes para el conocimiento de todos.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|Very much enjoyed the musicality and songs chosen for this album.  It would be really great if this opens the door to young people exploring music and it's expression more.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Excelente libro el cual recomiendo lean y compartan con sus amistades. Esta lleno de muchas cosas interesantes para el conocimiento de todos.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I enjoy The Piano Guys YouTube videos and it was fun to get their music.  It is my hope that younger musicians will see the value of learning classical instruments and see all the various things that can be done.  These are serious musicians, yet it is clear they enjoy and accept all types of music and what it can do for our lives!  Fantastic!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT YOU NEED IN TOUR PHONE, IPHONE, IPAD, OR COMPUTER. YOU CAN READ ANY DOCUMENT SEND FOR OTHERS AND PRINT.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|Just as described! Thank you! My son was so happy to replace the Thor that his dogs ate without purchasing the large set again.
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|Not sure if these CDs are \\"new\\" or authentic<br /><br />Mine came with a booklet that somehow had a bend/crease in it, yet wrapped in plastic<br /><br />I wish I could get a hold of another booklet bought from somewhere else to verify the way it looks inside,to see if same.<br /><br />SO BUYERS BEWARE<br /><br />paying regular price but I dont truly think these CDs are the exact same as you would buy in Walmart/BestBuy etc<br /><br />Mine came from UKmusic
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This game keeps them occupied for a solid 15 minutes.<br />I also believe this game teaches them skills, like how to<br />complete a shopping list, complete puzzles.  There are<br />so many little tasks that are actually beneficial.  Nothing<br />better than fun while learning....
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was excellent and hard to put down. Although some of the scenarios were alittle far-fetched, it is a cleverly written work of fiction.  I will be reading more Gillian Flynn novels.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I never thought I wanted or needed this app, but decided to try it anyway. I don't have problems with insomnia, but I have found that when I just need an extra hour of sleep, this really helps me wake up refreshed.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I haven't read any Stephen King that I didn't like.  This short story was as weird and captivating as any other.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I was so happy with my purchase. This movie has always been one of my favorites and I was so excited to be able to purchase it in blu-ray. I watched it the day it arrived and it was as great as I remembered.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best shows that is or ever has been on television!  Season three remains true to the earlier seasons with a great balance of character development and intense action.  If you are a fan of either well-plotted dramas or zombie action, this is an absolute must see!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best running games ever it's like your on an abandoned subway with trains like moving by itself lol if u don't download this your dumb
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I've grown up in a Christian culture. Many on this planet have also grown up in strong religious cultures of their own.  When Moorjani stepped beyond this world she saw the fallacy of separation and brings this message to us in a way that is still respectful of each reader's personal choices.  If one is struggling in any way I would suggest that this book will bring a greater universal perspective to their lives.  I'm grateful for her witness to this world.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|This movie demonstrates the ultimate consequence for defiling and raping an innocent young woman.  Be prepared for creative shock and horror!
B00B5P37IG|2.0|Not what I wanted. I removed it and didn't care it cost me ninety nine cents. It never did work
B009KEN87O|1.0|Four stars for the game, plus one for getting it as a FAOTD, minus everything for freezing my phone and causing me real-life problems.<br /><br />I played this game last night before bed on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I enjoyed playing it, and stopped when I got to a Tetris-like level (33, I think).<br /><br />The problem was that it froze my phone and I didn't know it, and so without my phone's alarm I slept through an appointment this morning!  I know that this app was to blame because 10:32 pm was frozen onto my phone's screen when I finally woke up, and that was the time I stopped playing last night.  This morning the phone would not respond at all until I physically removed removed the battery.  This might be a fun game, but I have never had an app screw up my phone (or my morning) like this before.  I will delete it right now, and not download it again unless it's fixed.  Buyer beware!
B0019LZV4E|2.0|When I first saw the previews for this I saw Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and I remembered what a great collaboration these two are. I watched this movie and it truly resulted in me waiting for it to get better. I watched the whole movie thinking it had to get up to the same level I know these two can reach. I was so disappointed.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because that's how much I enjoy Johnny Depp's acting. He does such a good job with most parts that are similar to this. I figure just because of this he deserves two stars.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|We were a bit disappointed in some close up scenes that appear &#34;jerky&#34; at times with the 3D conversion.  This conversion is not up to recent 3D movies we've watched at home.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I really liked this movie but it wasn't as good as the first two. I'm not sure what it was about the movie. The concept was good and as always Tommy Lee and Will Smith were great actors. I think the story line may have been missing something. Either way, it was still a good movie. Just not a good as the first MIBs.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I don't go to theaters much.  It was a great movie.  Would tell all my friends they will enjoy it.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|This is a good dance movie. It goes along the same lines as the earlier step up movies. Not much of a story line, but worth watching if you like to see some serious hip hop dancing.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book that I could not stop reading.  The author's story of stumbling on the Henrietta Lacks story and the 10 years she spent researching is as fascinating as the Henrietta Lacks story itself.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|BEAUTIFUL ...STORIES!,<br /><br />Great story line, easy to slide into the authors world.<br />Great  insight into teen thought process.<br />Sensitive look at teen turmoil and insecurities
0345803485|5.0|I hear how most of the reviews are very negative and displeasing, however, I loved this book so much, very obsessed with the characters intense \\"Kinky yet in-Love\\" relationship. If you like twilight, I would highly recommend reading this one. I imagine Mr. Grey would look like Edward in Twilight ;P How my imagination wanders.
B0087EACJK|2.0|This game wants each level completed within a specific time frame, but it doesn't show a clock or any indication of what that time frame is until the second time through the level. The runner is sluggish to respond (and that is not the fault of my device), so even when I know exactly how to complete the level, I have trouble staying within the 'time to beat'. The tiles must be completely in place to zoom back in, but they don't always go there on the first (or second) swipe. Several times, I zoomed out while trying to get the runner to move. Multiple quick view changes with small movements required in some levels feel tedious. Glad I didn't pay for it!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|she u play it take for ever to level up and when u try to get a 3 stared. animal it takes a long time u need lots ot gass to get it. then u need money and lots of it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this book for our book club's March read.  We have read other &#34;teen&#34;  books and have thoroughly enjoyed them.  Always great conversations.  However, I think this book will  be one of our highest rated &#34;teen reads&#34; as well as a great &#34;adult read&#34;.  Too often books are labeled for a particular audience and too often we as adult miss great works because they are labeled &#34;teen&#34;.  This is a book not to be missed by adults!!!!  If possible take that label off it.<br /><br />Anyone who has cancer, is the caregiver for a person with cancer, a survivor of cancer, or who has a chronic illness should read this book. It provides a look into the thoughts of those with cancer and how we experience our disease and the world.  It provides hope, a reason to live each day to the fullest because if we don't we miss out on life.  And the disease wins.  It reminds us that we are still a person; we are not our disease.<br /><br />I look forward to our conversation at Book Club on 4/12.  It will be lively.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Every time I listen to a KILLSWITCH ENGAGE album, I always feel pleased with the final result, and with their new album, DISARM THE DESCENT, nothing could be closer to the truth. DISARM THE DESCENT brings back Jesse Leach, who called it quits with the band after their first major album ALIVE OR JUST BREATHING, while Howard Jones took over vocal duties for three straight albums, one of which is AS DAYLIGHT DIES, which is my favorite KSE album with him as the vocalist. Leach's vocals are even better than they previously were, and the rest of the band only makes this whole experience better, especially since it features some of the most skilled guitar work I've heard from this band. My favorite track so far has to be YOU DON'T BLEED FOR ME, followed by the single IN DUE TIME, THE HELL IN ME, THE TURNING POINT, and NEW AWAKENING. This is one of those albums where I feel guilty picking a favorite track because all of them are so good (well... except for ALL WE HAVE), and unbelievably, even the live songs on the deluxe CD are worth the amount of money this album is available for. So far, this is tied with RELEASE THE PANIC by RED for Best Album of 2013, and KILLSWITCH ENGAGE is clearly better than ALL THAT REMAINS now.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Story telling at its best, a real page turner. I loved the experience through the dogs perspective. Poignant at times.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|I wish I could give this game more stars as I really enjoy playing it. Unfortunately there are some things I don't care for. Every time you buy something or increase your land the price goes up and it's hard to make money. Also it's hard to earn gems and easy to spend them. Of course you can buy them but I don't care to spend money on garbage. So getting anywhere in this game is difficult.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|It was in excellent shape and sounds as good as it did when it first came out in the 70s.  It deserves an A+.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|this is a very good movie.  I love the plot and  action in it.  and it has a lot more with it than I expected. extra DVD's included
0062082353|5.0|We ought this book for our son. He has really enjoyed it. His dad may want to read it when he's done!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I really love the message in this movie.  it should be a guideline for all Godly men who are daddies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on my iPad. I installed it on my daughters kindle so I can play it when she's on my iPad!
B00005RGNY|5.0|Has several of my personal favorite's from Shakira.  Like Underneath Your Clothes so well I also found the EP with the acoustic version.  Great addition to my cassette collection and sounds awesome through my Pioneer dual cassette deck.  Also have CD but this review is for the cassette version, which I prefer soundwise vs a cd with the right stereo settings.  Objection, Whenever/Wherever both rockin' Shakira tunes and like them better in her native Spanish tongue.  When I find an LP version my collection will be complete.  Unfortunately her last cassette release.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It was so sad.  The writing was good, but depressing.  The trip was great.  It ended not like I expected it to
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; as a child and this film did not disappoint. What a joyous ride! This movie is worth seeing.
0345525558|3.0|I just couldn't relate to the characters. The foster care sadness is too much for me.  It does make you appreciate the survival of the spirit despite all odds
B000HL09MG|1.0|I don't think dialogue should have the tempo of a South Park episode, but this is ridiculous.  The sets looked B budget.  It seems like the whole movie was about talking slow like everyone is stoned and having lusty sex.  I guess if you're into less than soft porn, it's fine.  I'm not really sure what the conflict was supposed to be here other than the secret super-rich peoples' house where they have sex with high-rolling prostitutes.<br /><br />I suppose the ritualistic nature of the goings on in the &#34;party house&#34; could be interpreted as some reference to Illuminati or Bohemian Grove rituals, but it doesn't matter.  This movie is stupid...
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I hope Gina Carano gets to play MODESTY BLAISE. She would be perfect. Here we have a beautiful healthy figure of a woman who not only has acting skills but is the real deal in mixed martial arts. The drama & action are teriffic. The stunts were coordanited by J.J a bloke who worked with Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson in the RUNDOWN. This is a very smart action spy thriller.
1401938906|5.0|Several months ago I heard an advertisement for this book while listening to Hay House Radio.  My immediate response was, \\"I need that book!\\"  Being the book junkie that I am though, it isn't (currently) in my budget to buy every book that sounds interesting to me.  So I looked it up at the library.  No copies.  Drat!<br /><br />Several weeks later, I spontaneously found myself browsing the Hay House site and came up on their blogger community.  That, I now realize, was miracle #1.  This community allows bloggers to receive copies of certain books for free in exchange for a review posted to the blogger's website.  I signed up for the program and received the book just a few days later.<br /><br />If you're into spirituality, the power of intention, quantum physics, or anything along those lines, you would love this book.  It's absolutely perfect for the person who has done extended reading on the topics (me!) but can't manage to move beyond the feeling of being stuck.  Sure you may come up on a little proof of the Universe working in your favor now and then, but it's soon forgotten and sucked into the void of feeling like you have no power over your life.<br /><br />This book provided me with the necessary guidance I needed to truly know that my thoughts have power through 9 cut and dry exercises.  The best part is, Ms. Pam Grout is writes in a language that is accessible, humorous and the very opposite of boring.  The lessons are concise, to the point, and best of all - offer NO ROOM FOR QUESTIONING.  At the end of each experiment you KNOW that God heard your plea.<br /><br />When it all boils down to it, what these experiments aim to do is solidify our faith.  You either believe or you don't.  You can't be wishy washy and that's where most of us get stuck.  You also can't send mixed signals... Like, \\"I really want to lose weight, but I also really want to have 10 pieces of chocolate cake today.\\"  You have to be honest with yourself about what you really want.  That's the other place where we get stuck.  We don't truly know what we want.<br /><br />Through practicing the experiments in this book, you can begin to hone in on what it is you're truly asking for.  As Grout states, begin with simple things first.  Some things take longer than others.  Don't expect to become a millionaire over night.  Also, keep your eyes and intuition open.  You have to recognize that your question and desires have been answered.  Sometimes the answers don't come the way you wanted, or expected.  Most important of all though, is don't waiver in your belief.  Most spiritual traditions teach this critical element and now it's backed up by science.  The observer creates and changes the observed.  It's true.<br /><br />Finally, just to prove to you that I'm not just writing this for naught, I will share two stories about thoughts/things I manifested while going through the experiments in this book.  The first one comes in the form of a Needak rebounder (a mini trampoline).  I've wanted one for several years, and have had a cheap one in the past, that only lasted me about two months.  I had only been reading E-Squared for a couple of hours when suddenly the word \\"rebounder\\" popped into my mind.  A few minutes later I was on Craigslist where, lo and behold, someone was selling two Needak rebounders for half of their original price.  I have NEVER seen a Needak on Craigslist in all the years I've been looking for one.<br /><br />I now own the rebounder.  And, just to add to the delight of the story, it's worth noting that the person I bought it from - the complete and total Craigslist stranger - was also very much into miracles, Wayne Dyer and other things along this course.  She even had the words, \\"I am entitled to miracles\\" written on her forearm.  There's no denying God in this equation.<br /><br />The second example is a little more subtle.  I happened to drop my camera right on it's lens in the middle of my son's birthday party.  I had experienced trouble with the lens before and tried everything I could to fix it.  I couldn't.  I was sure that this was it for my poor little camera, which I actually use for one of my jobs.  Drat again!  A little later in the day, one of the chapters was guiding me to manifest something specific, immediately my mind told me what I wanted, \\"a camera!\\"<br /><br />A few minutes later I found myself on YouTube looking up instructions on how to fix my camera.  Even though I had already given up on it.  I pretty much thought I was about to take it apart and really ruin it.  Instead I came up on a simple tutorial that said to slap the camera on your palm and gently guide the lens out.  Can you believe this worked?  Suddenly the lens that was absolutely stuck and would not move a millimeter was working just fine.  I had a camera again.  Sure, it wasn't a new camera, but I gave the Universe 48 hours to give me a camera and I had one within 30 minutes.  I accepted it with gratitude.<br /><br />Please don't think that the only thing you can manifest are material objects.  These examples are important because we like to be able to see things physically.  But we can also use this book to ask for guidance and to help manifest peace and love in our hearts - that's where the real power lies. Like I said before, it's really about cultivating and maintaining faith.  So yeah, read this book.  I got it for free, but if I knew then what I know now, I would have gladly paid for it.  Thanks Pam Grout and thank you Hay House!rouble with the lens before and tried everything I could to fix it.  I couldn't.

B008M7JODC|5.0|great show that grabs your attention, your interest, and even your desire to believe. I hope the rest of the seasons are as distinctly thoughtout and developed as this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I like about is that it is more fun than temple run and a lot easier.Also I like how it changes themes and does not stay to be one theme.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've never seen a better game in my life . If I were you I'd get the game right now instead of sitting and reading other people's reviews. Is SOOOO worth the tiny little $6.99!!! GET IT NOW
B0054JZC6E|5.0|They are super generous with the coins! There are so many games and you will never run out of coins! Even if you keep on losing at game over and over again they'll give you coins for &quot;persistence&quot;!! A definite must have.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|I bought this to use for work and it doesn't recognize text or even run w/o crashing. Waste of money. B how do i get a refund?
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is one of the best of the Jack Reacher series of books in my view.  It has a good set of characters and a plausible story line  It's a fast and entertaining read.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|We listen to the music all the time..it is so clear and beautiful sounding and so &#34;Hawaiian&#34;...hope we can go back in near future.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|All in one place. Can view videos and sites directly. Very easy to use. Easily navigated with a thumb even on the Kindle.

B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I'm 57 yrs old and I still mainly listen to the old comfortable classic 60's,70's music that I grew up with. Well, now I'm all shaken up! Finally! Here is a band \\"Walk Off The Earth\\",I've never heard of before, from Burlington Ontario,near Toronto where I grew up. They give me that 60's feelings all over again! I'm very impressed. Except for their excellent famous cover song \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", all the other songs on this CD are original. This band has elements of Reggae,Ska,60's harmonic Rock and Pop,country,rap,you name it,I even detected a bit of jazz. My favourite songs are; \\"Revo\\",\\"Gang Of Rhythm\\",\\"Red Hands\\",\\"Summer Vibe\\" among others out of the eleven. Their YouTube videos of these are great too. But the sound on the CD is better. Everyone in WOTE does vocal parts, and they are multi- instrumentalists too. Well done!
0425252868|5.0|Excellent.  A present for my father who was in the Air Force at this time and he was actually excited about it and couldn't put it down. Authentic and a great buy!
B005SDMDRW|1.0|Michael Connelly is the best... I have every book of his...but this collection of excerpts from other books looks to me like scraps swept up off the floor and put into a cover to make a few more bucks for someone. Certainly not short stories.  Very disappointing.  Stories had no real feel of beginning or end.  Was almost like the cleaner had picked up these discarded bits off the floor and published them under the Connelly name to make morning tea money.  Yep the book was cheap... and nasty too.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Rarely does a movie improve on the novel but in this case it did.  Excellent well written story; I wish I had read it before seeing the movie.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book suffers from the same flaws as other books by would-be \\"writers.\\" A decent story idea, poorly executed.<br /><br />Spellcheck is no substitute for proofreading. Editing a manuscript is not an optional extra--a decent editor would have caught the multiple examples of bad grammar, inconsistent language, and repetitive (and inappropriate) word choices.<br /><br />If the author would take the time to learn the craft, they could be a decent writer someday, but this effort is juvenile and unpolished.<br /><br />I paid $2.99 for the book and that was more than it was worth.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i love this game, it comes from facebook, and its real fun to play, go ahead and give it a try
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a great concert version of a timeless classic. in fact when I saw this program on OPB (this being the first time i had seen les miserables) I was complelty taken.<br /><br />I have seen the newest film (starting Hugh Jackman Etc.) and the last live tour and found this version to be the best.<br /><br />Alfred boe is AMAZING as valjean. I cant say i was a huge fan of Nick Jonas as Marius but it doesn't take away from the show at all<br /><br />If you are a fan of les miserables or just wanting to get a taste of the show i would reccomend seeing this film.<br />it may be a bit confusing if this is your first time watching les mis (since it is done concert style and therefor there is not a ton of movement and some parts are left out if they are not sung)
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Easy to use, fast upload and access to My eBay, and does what it is intended to. Great way to check items I am selling or bidding on throughout the day.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I bought the paper back version first read it and fell in love with it. Then I got my kindle and I knew I had to buy it just to have it lol. So I just finished  're-reading it so I can read WALKING DISASTER!!! Already purchased it and I can't wait to get started! All I know is I hope Abby and Travis story continues!!! Hint hint to the author lol ;)
B004UPALT6|2.0|If you liked ED1 then you will probably like ED2 because it's basically the same movie with minor script changes.
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is one great movie!! It was beyond its time when it came out but i love it. Picture and sound quality is good a must buy for the collection.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|I don't know why they didn't call this one Evil Dead 3 as it starts off where ED2 ended with one major change.
B005J9ZE5I|3.0|The picture quality is good but the sound quality is horrible. Which it doesnt matter to me since i am a fan of the evil dead franchise and bluray collector.
B000VYNYN0|2.0|This is the kind of movie we used to go to the drive in to see because we weren't there to see a movie and didn't care how good, or bad, it was.
B003IY48PS|3.0|I remember seeing this movie as a kid, its funny how it looks so cheesy now haha. over all the quality is good but the sound is poor. I had to turn my reciever as loud as it could go to hear the sound decent. Would recommend if your a true fan and bluray collector.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Easy reading, well-designed eating plan that is easy to follow, satisfying, and has been successful for me.  Began following the plan March 9, have lost 12 pounds, a reasonable amount, and plan to continue following it through all 4 phases.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is a awesome movie and awesome quality sound is good as well. Would recommend if you are a fan of these kind of movies.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This man went from &#34;trouble&#34; to triumph.  It was an easy read.  I am a military veteran and can &#34;relate&#34; to some of the history.  It was a struggle but God, and His people on earth, buoyed this man into a God filled life.  Brave, Brave man.  Uplifting.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like building the town up to what I like and the few fights I've been in. Takes a lot of time getting the money I need to build since I'm not connected all the time to the Internet.  To bad it could not be more like SimCity. But like I said like to see the city grow.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|What a realistic portrait of real world relationships. Unpredictable changes of events that keep you vested in the outcome. Thanks for the journey!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run Is much better than the first one. The graphics are awesome and the obstacles are different than the ones from the first Temple Run. The different characters are fun and there are even objectives and a lot more features! It's really good! :D
B007BGQFTQ|2.0|Soulless is a great title for this book, because that is what it is, a book without a soul. If you compare Miss Tarabotti to any of the truly enduring and legendary detectives: Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, and Nero Wolfe or the more contemporary Harry Dresden, Tarabotti pales in comparison. What little information the author reveals about Alexia is quite unremarkable. It appears the author cannot make up her mind, whether she is writing a murder mystery or a romance novel.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|While getting away from his earlier work sonically, I nevertheless like the progression that the music has taken.  I usually just take all the Bonobo albums and put them on shuffle.  This one is a nice addition to that mix, I'm not sure he can put out a bad album.
