B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Quick, easy and inspiring.  Every reader will glean a few new ideas....mainly, get up and get going with whatever inspires you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Very good simulator just as good as the first one! Worth 0.99 cents! I definitely recommend this app! And don't forget updates are coming!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|He is a very interesting writer. Characters relate to real life people and situations that they get into. I would highly recommend it for reading.<br /><br />  Jeneen
B005FFW46S|5.0|No one does a better job at combining sociology,morality, and comedy in one art form. No matter what life is like here on planet earth; a visit to the Discworld is always a welcomed event. I hope there will always be more books by Mr. Pratchett. His cast of characters and the character of his cast are like family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. As you read it, it kept your interest as to what was going to happen next. I know things like that happen in real life. I would highly recommend.<br />  Jeneen
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best game.  I play it daily. I have made many new bingo friends and it is just so much fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. started it and couldn't. stop. some clues very challenging. cant wait for the next levels. hope they are coming soon.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great. It lets me know how long my battery will last (on standby mind you) and it can also tell me my battery's health, voltage, temperature, and what kind of battery I have all of which can be a big help especially since I have a Lithium Ion battery. I totally think it's worth owning, but as for the $0.99 value&hellip; I don't know. I would certainly recommend this to other Kindle users.
B00DIXEZTI|5.0|I wasn't much of a fan of the movies of Hannibal. Something always seemed to be missing. Like they were trying to impress with us with a subtlety that wasn't there. This series doesn't suffer the same fate. If you have an interest in human motivation, subconscious refraction, haute cuisine, character development, photography, cinematography, Freudian, Jungian, tailored suits, iconoclastic stags, forensics, sleep walking, and psychopathic manipulation: well this is for you! The cast is brilliant. The sets drive the story. The score in the last episode will make you feel unstable. Watch it if you can digest cannibalism as an art form.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|This season had me on the edge of my seat the entire season. I didn't think I would like this show at all and after 3 episodes I'm completely and utterly addicted !!!!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I really like this so  it is really fun but I gave it four stars because I hate how they show you what your missing out on because you have the free version instead of the paid version. That s my only complaint.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This app isn't compatible with the original kindle fire do NOT download. It says I don't have enough space even after clearing other apps off my kindle. now I cant delete this app off to make room for my previous apps that worked. I'm a huge fan of Magic, this is very dissapointing.
B0001HK0RA|1.0|doesnt work, keeps saying wrong region. there is not a way to get it to play in my dvd player.
B004ZIHYXO|5.0|Glad I bought this..always fun tolisten to.. Not G rated but gets me hopping and dancing...glad I bought this CD
B003G4W49C|5.0|A wonder Hollywood hasn't managed to make a horrible movie from this tale!  The author does not pander to his readers, he writes a story with &#34;good guys&#34; and &#34; bad guys&#34; but really they're just people doing what they can to survive. Some do while others don't . Between the &#34;children&#34; and the &#34;adults&#34; there is a serious disconnect resulting in some even more horrific damage and cynical behavior on both &#34;sides&#34;. Looking back, I hardly believe I could be so ingenious as to not realize the conclusion to Ender's education!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This case is perfect for my Plantronics Voyager Pro HD headset.  When I travel it provides the perfect protection in my bag.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What I like....it keeps you entertained, not boring and is very addictive!  My only complaint is I wish there were more levels; other than that this game is AWESOME!
B007N0REX6|5.0|Unbelievable. Great workout music. Great spinning and weight lifting music. This is the best album I have purchased in a ong time.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Its a fun movie and I enjoy having it on DVD so I can share it with my grand kids
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book<br />It took me only 2 weeks to finish I read it all the time because it's so intriguing
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I'll write this from a teacher view. I teach eighth grade...and they  love it.  I let them watch it just for fun, then we get into many literature elements.  They really like discussing it.  Great.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|What a trashy piece of porno.  Next time I'll read the trailer first and not listen to the gossip about a book
B00846REIS|1.0|I loved 50 shades.  I read a lot of silly, smutty books. ;)  But I don't care about theses characters.  Sure, the sex scenes were hot, but I'm done.  Wish I could undownload it or exchange it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not quite as good as The Kite Runner. Enjoyed all of the characters and how they developed throughout the book.
0440246318|5.0|I have read every Jack Reacher novel and loved every one of them. This is no exception. A Wanted Man was hard to put down. As always, Jack Reacher gets into a &#34;situation&#34; and manages to get out in one piece.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Very entertaining - I kept wanting there to be the fairytale happy ending.  But thank goodness the author decided to make an interesting read rather than a predictable read.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|Wallace's short writing career produced some unusual novels.  I found them very engaging.  I.J. has some of best insights into addiction and addictive behaviors that I have read.  The book version is easier to read than the Kindle because of all the footnotes, which are a necessary part of the narrative.
0345410025|4.0|I liked the book very descriptive in the different methods on how to memorize and really like how the authors went back and forth with their personal stories
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have read enough books for several life times. Books very rarely surprise me. This book surprised me, more than once. This is not a Law & Order formula thriller.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|My favorite band so I always buy their CDs at full price.  They are well worth it.  If you don't know their work, give High Violet a listen first, then this.  The older releases (Alligator, Boxer, Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers) also excellent.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|My wife actually watched this title, and really enjoyed it.  She got through all of the seasons available on Prime in just a few short days and it really held her attention.  Definitely some very cute parts and made her laugh a lot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very fun but short... just the right difficultly and a great time waster!! plus it is free and will save your wallet. but please come up with a new and less annoying song!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this one.  I could have sworn this was a trilogy but was surprised and glad to learn this is not the last in the series.  As I neared the end I kept thinking how is she going to wrap up all the loose ends in the next few pages?  She doesn't, the plot just thickens.  Any way it was a great read and I fall in love with both characters more with each book.  They are messed up people but you have to love the fact they are not perfect. There are many steamy love scenes and the story keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.  Hate putting this book down.
B00846REIS|3.0|Good the book is good. I enjoyed the price and I like what the author writes in her stories. G
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and recommend to others who like a challenge. Worth the money and enjoy a neat experience.
B005I4JG80|2.0|The book is full of recommendations that are obvious. I am not american, but i don't like the simple picture the author presents of them.
B004CYECF4|1.0|I ordered Season 5 to play on my DVD player, but the product was formatted for use on EUROPEAN players. This made the purchase useless to me and a waste of time and money.
B0028ADKNE|5.0|It's really good and some words will have a cross at the end and at the end the meaning will be there,so don't freak out when u don't know the definition and u can't look it up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. It was mystery, romance, action and much more. I can't wait to see the movie and read the next two books.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|It was not up to Grisham's standards in my opinion. I liked the main character, but the rest of the family members left a lot to be desired. Maybe a good read for a younger audience.
B004HD61KE|4.0|this was a great read I thought the suspense and action was good. I like James  Rollins way of keeping you reading right to the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game! my 11 y/o son and I played together and had a lot of fun. hope to see more levels added soon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this book as our book club selection which someone else chose.  Couldn't put it down.  Unpredictable ending. Try it!
B000062YAZ|5.0|The greatest Slayer/thrash song of all time. There isn't a thrash collection completed without this masterpiece. Must have for every Slayer/thrash fan.
B000V8MQZI|5.0|I love the foo foo fighters and I love all the songs off this album. I'm very happy I bought it!
B000062YB1|5.0|This song is 23 years old and still is awesome!  Still a classic to this day and always will be.
B000RLW5VO|5.0|I love the song Running on empty it reminds me of Forrest Gump every time I listen to it! It plays great!
B005PK56TA|1.0|A very childish, attempt at shock value approach to this story. I think I may be made it 15 minutes into the series before i gave up on it.
B000XCZGPE|5.0|This record has some great songs on it. I love listening to them on a record player. Glad I bought it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It has very good game play and graphics. The story is interesting enough to make you want to keep playing and the challenges are hard without being impossible.
B000002LOE|4.0|There's no denying that Out of Time is the record that officially launched R.E.M. into the stratosphere of the public consciousness. The single \\"Losing My Religion\\" still remains arguably their biggest hit and most recognizable song, the title of which is well-deserved. It still sounds fresh nearly 25 years later but it's not the only track that has that effect. The haunting \\"Country Feedback\\" remains of their most devastating ballads, a twisted tale of a dysfunctional relationship that's on the verge of complete collapse. Bassist Mike Mills lends lead vocals to \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" and \\"Texarkana\\", both of which soar with jangly guitars and soaring choruses. \\"Half a World Away\\" is a gentle folk-tinged number that puts the band's new emphasis on country music to full effect. The closer \\"Me in Honey\\" is beautiful and \\"Shiny Happy People\\", despite its pop cheese, is still quite fun to listen to if you take it for what it is. In short: there's a lot of great material here that has held up remarkably well.<br /><br />However, my main issue with Out of Time is that there are several tracks that don't pack the same punch. \\"Radio Song\\" opens with potential but the cheesy raps of KRS-One sink it almost immediately. It feels too forced to be anything other than a throwaway. \\"Low\\" and \\"Endgame\\" feature some wonderful instrumental touches but neither song ever gets off the ground and they come off more as experimental tests than engaging songs. \\"Belong\\" fares a bit better but still fails to really grab my attention as a whole.<br /><br />There are a few hiccups scattered throughout that hold it back from reaching the heights of Murmur or Automatic for the People but this is a different mountain altogether. The band continued to follow their vision and no doubt lost some fans in the process. It's also that same relentless pursuit of new sounds that gained them an entirely new generation of fans as well. This was a big stepping stone for them and, while not my favorite R.E.M. release, it does hold up to repeated listens. Here's hoping we get a remastered anniversary edition in the near future.ase, it does hold up to repeated listens. Here's hoping we get a remastered anniversary edition in the near future.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great book! Suspense and mystery at its finest! Highly recommend this book! You won't put this book down until you're through -
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed having all of my favorates in one place.  I would of like to see Edward Norton as the Hulk though.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Iliked the fact thar SOOKIE finally came into her own and not dependant on how others felt. i feel there is still questions left unanswered, so there has to be more books.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|Tekkon Kinkreet is an anime film that was recommended to me so was trying to look for it on Amazon.com. Found it and can't wait to watch it. So far haven't but excited to see it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Just when you think you have the ending all figured out, she takes you totally by surprise and that is what I love about her stories.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was so good. I had seen movie first and loved it and couldn't wait to read the book, so I bought it! Great book!
B00006JKON|5.0|Jethro Tull  isn't just a person in a band pisses me off when people  think  that's how it is .This CD  has a lot of great material on it especially bungle in the jungle.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed the adobe Reader for my Kindle Fire in order to view some videos and other web sites.  It was really needed.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This product worked correctly right out of the box; the manufacturer was quick to respond with email support containing installation instructions and the appropriate driver was found at their web site. The converter is being used in a Ham radio application involving a Dell laptop running Win 7 and a Yaesu FT-1000MP amateur radio transceiver; both are working flawlessly. I recommend this product.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I really enjoy movies where you have to think a lot more and figure out what is going on.  Very creative idea for a movie too.
1781162646|5.0|Since I am a die hard Stephen King fan, it wasn't hard to order and read this book with high expectations.  And as usual, Mr. King didn't disappoint.  This book had me from the beginning.  Hooking me into the character development from the very beginning.<br />It was a joy to read(no pun intended).  Giving it 5 stars seems like a disservice, but since that's the maximum, I guess I have to go with it.  Would recommend this to everyone!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted a horse and this is the next best thing! I love this game so so much!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|its not about being selfish but being in control of your life to the point where you can be of benefit to others.<br />Read it then go make a difference in the world
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app!  It is easy to install and very usable.  I can read my books on my Kindle Fire, or on my phone.  If I have read to a certain point on one device, it will update the each device to the furthest  point.
B005PR422K|4.0|I'm currently exiting one business and entering a more exciting business, this book has been very helpful in this process. Some great real world examples.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|It has lots of features which I did not get to use yet. It would have been useful while in school.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Once again, the band excels in a music compilation like no other. Beats that keep going in your head days later. A must in your catalog collection.
0989524116|5.0|\\"An imaginative must read! The Inner Movement (read Outview first) is turning into an incredible series that everyone should read, and I'm hoping will one day be turned into movies. Original and startling concepts fill the story along with characters that pull you in with their wisdom and strangeness. I've told a bunch of friends about Outview and they all loved it. And Outin is even more fun!\\"
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, this series is great.  My daughter in law recommended this book to me because she new that I read and liked 50 shades.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautifully written book.  Hosseini has masterfully interwoven stories across generations that tug the reader into an emotional connection with the characters.  Bravo!  I can't wait for his next book.
B001AW156U|3.0|I have tried these out and they are awesomely comfortable to hold. The control over your triggers is great. The problem is that it is very difficult to put them on in a way that doesn't rub against the controller. I found that they would push in the trigger just enough to activate its function, and we all know that non-stop firing in any shooter is bad for your stealth. If the game lets you modify the triggers deadzone then you could probably fix the issue, but not all games have that function.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Wow, and I really do mean WOW! Reading this book brought back memories of news reports in regards to Jaycee's sudden disappearance in 1991. Since my parents, sister and I lived in South Lake Tahoe at the time of her kidnapping, both of my parents had joined the ranks of assembled search parties hoping of finding her which had of course came up empty. I would've also joined the search parties, but as a 13 year old boy with Carebrel Palsy and school at that time made it impossible for me to help; my 17 year old sister might've been able to help though.<br /><br />Anyways, even though this book is a very disturbingly hard read, I'm giving it a five star review in light of Jaycee's enormous courage and striength which is how she endured 18 terrible years of minipulation, verbal and physical abuse, childhood rape, and many others thanks to her abductor.<br /><br />While it is true that repetitiveness annoyingly undermines the storylines within books, it plays a very important role within this book which further tells it's readers what's going on, like how much Jaycee missed her mom, and how her kidapper believed that âangelsâ controled him; personally, I believe that Satin âthe devil and his daemonsâ was behind all of his actions.<br /><br />I must admit that as I got near the end, I cried my heart out in the chapter where Jaycee described her rescue and reunification with her family and friends. This emotional side of me continued sheding tears as I read on. The inclusion of her pictures and the integration of her journal entries was overall a really nice touch. I also like fact that this book was entirely written by her and not someone else.<br /><br />Jaycee, if your reading this: When I watched the special report of your rescue on ABC News with Diane Sawyer in 2009, I became estatically overjoyed for you and your family; the same held true when I leaned of a portion of the proceeds from booksales of this book goes directly towards your JAYC Foundation, so naturally I purchaced and read it on my Kindle to help out.<br /><br />Please note that some graphically adult content contained within a few pages of this book, mainly the rape scenes and minor foul language, may not be suitable for all readers. As such, I strongly recommend that parents read this book beforehand and then together with thier children if they deem appropiate. Reader discrition is advised.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly and hope more levels are released I n the near future. Gotta try it,you won't regret downloading t his game. Good luck.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting!!!!!!I love it....I play it everyday. I SUGGEST you get this!!!!<br />This is so awesome please gettttttttttt!!!!!!!
0439023513|4.0|I absolutely loved \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" was even better, but I was disappointed with \\"Mockingjay\\".  It was still engaging and well written, but I don't like where she took the characters. Katniss was always able to carry on through the pressure, but in \\"Mockingjay\\", she's just so broken. I felt the same way about what happens to Peeta. And maybe that's the point Collins is trying to make.  That we all have our breaking point, but I hated to see Katniss so defeated and Peeta lose himself. The other thing that bothered me was how the love triangle ended. I won't give away who she ends up with, but it wasn't only that I was rooting for the other one.  It was that I didn't feel like Katniss chose. I feel like she took the one that was left instead of the one she really wanted. In the end, Collins wraps everything up, but it left me feeling unsatisfied.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is the greatest Concert ever recorded.....I burned up the VHS years ago, This is my Second copy of the DVD as my Ex kept the other one lol
0439023521|5.0|Nothing could tear this book out of my hands while I was reading it. The story is engaging and the writing is superb. It was my first experience reading something in a present first person tense and the result was impossible to put down. It reminds me a lot of Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\", but not in a way that I feel Collins ripped off someone else's idea; just expounded on it.<br /><br />To me, the chracterization was Collins greatest strength.  Katniss was especially well written.  Her strengths and weaknesses combine to make a strong, but relatable person. Peeta is sometimes too good to be true, but it makes him all the more endearing.  Haymitch is a mean, dirty, hopeless drunk, but I love him for it.<br /><br />The dystopian scenario she creates is so scary to me because I don't see us being that far off from something like this.  We already celebrate violence and bloodshed in movies and television. How long before our society gets bored with that and makes it real?<br /><br />All in all, definitely worth reading.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the begining. It's an authentic love story and I highly suggest if you like to read, then buy this book. It's the best I've read in a very long time.
0062059963|3.0|I read this book in a day and I don't know why. It was the same with its' predecessor.  I kept turning pages and wondering why I couldn't stop. Not much really happens. America does find out more about the darker side of Illea's history and touches on a conspiracy, but it stays focused on the cliche, back and forth romance aspect most of the time. At the end of the book, she's pretty much back exactly where she started. The one reason I gave this three stars was because of one scene in which the author showed the really nasty side of the government, but I won't go into anymore detail because I don't like spoilers in reviews.
1579121306|5.0|I chose five stars because the quality of this book is extraordinary. I like that the puzzles were well crafted. I would recommend this product to all chess enthusiasts.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|I love the Walsh family series. This is my favorite kind of summer reading: light, funny, heartwarming. If you're not a fan of chick lit, this might not be your thing, but if you are, I think Keyes is one of the best writers around.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. It's always entertaining and keep you going. Sometimes it's hard to stop playing it's addictive!!!
B0024HH32A|5.0|I love this movie. It is so funny. We love the tv show as well. Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould were great. A good movie to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is good for kids and it is educational. The game will excite everyone and parents could have their kid  play it and relax.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack when I went to Europe for two weeks and did not want to bring my Crumpler bag so I can hike, walk around and be able to shoot and for the ease of having a backpack instead of a bag hanging over one side of my shoulder. This bag was SO much more than I expected, I was able to fit my Canon T1i, along with a 1.5L water bottle, my snacks, sunglasses, pad of paper, pen, etc. Because it has velcro inside, you can easily adjust it according to what you need to fit. I did not pack any lens in my bag but it would easily fit lens in there.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a backpack for your SLR and want a bag that is versatile and on the go. One of the best purchases I have made just by looking at amazon. For this price and functionality, it really can't be beat. Can't wait to use it again!
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book brought tears to my eyes. It is incredibly breathtaking. A true love story that any girl would fall in love with.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book so good, that I had to re-read 3 times.  Just to make sure that I did not miss anything!
0141439475|5.0|Good quality book, got there in perfect shape, and rating it just as an object that got delivered it gets 5 stars, but as a novel I do not know yet cuz I haven't finished it :P
1401207529|5.0|This is meant to be about Batman's origins, but I often felt we learned a lot more about Jim Gordon's struggles and his life, than Batman's. This is a good thing though because Gordon is very relatable. He seems like a normal guy just trying to make the world a better place and look out for his family. The parts about batman were also good though haha. He is also more relatable at this stage as he is still learning. He is more fallable so it is easier to understand his humanity. Exciting comic.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|This game finally unlocked the key to pinballing for me. I never really liked pinball games, because there's almost always an element of surprise. You never know when your ball is going to go through the little path on either end, and then it is all ruined. However, this game was compelling to me for some reason. I tried it, and I was hooked in the first few minutes. Eventually, I figured out the irony. I bought this game on May the fourth. Tee-hee!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love the dragons and can't wait to see what baby Dragon will hatch next.  This game is extremely addictive, if only time could speed up.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I totally love Hugh Jackman but missed getting the DVD when it first came out on. By the time I wanted to buy it, Walmart and Best Buys were selling it at it's full price, so I really love that Amazon was selling it at a cheaper rate.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Very happy. great price. The quality was more than expected. Looks and feels great. highly recommond this to anyone.the price was right. under $70. Shipped
B008JH5CVS|3.0|I missed seeing it in the movies, so either it was a straight to DVD movie or it just had a short run in the movie theaters. The movie was interesting and there was enough action there to keep me awake.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am happy to have a great end to the longest series of my life.  The only question is when should I start to reread them?
0812550706|1.0|How anyone could give five stars to this infantile fantasy written for twelve year olds is completely mystifying to me.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Smooth and funky. What else do you need to know. A great combination of vocals and beats. A modern yacht rock. So smooth.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I have an HP Laserjet 2015 that was just plain slow, every job seemed to take for ever. After doing some research I found that more memory should help, so I maxed it out with this chip. The difference was instant, no more error messages, and fast printing. What more can you ask.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a cute and fun game to play. You build a gigantic village and meet slot of ice age characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great series.  The dynamics between the staff and the elite is so interesting.  Actors are fabulous - especially Maggie Smith.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting and fun to play!!! We just can't stop playing this very fun game! My whole entire family likes to play!
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Best CD since Surfing with the Alien.  I think it's stuck in my CD player though because it's been on continuous play since I got it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's very fun and hard try your best and don't give up you will eventually get it if you have a problem ask a family member
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Pairing a great vocal talent and a great guitar player - what's not to like.  Joe provides excellent backing guitar and Beth brings the smokin' vox.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazingly awesome :) Best horse game of today :) I suggest everyone get this app, I guarantee youll lover this app 100 percent :)
193700788X|1.0|It is almost like Harris gave up and just threw a bunch of crap together. It was boring and a hard read. It doesn't drive you to keep reading like the others. Almost nothing exciting happened. The inconsistencies between this book and the others is astounding. It was almost as if she was pulling crap out her arse to finish the book... Which ended with a shrug of the shoulders and not much else... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Borrow it if you must... but the ending is best left to your imagination. As this one was garbage. Worst ending to an an adventure mystery series EVER!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I believe it fine once I learn to do more and with that said I would download it in a minute.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Addicting and very easy to follow. Great for all ages. You will have hours and hours of fun.<br />Win battles against the game and other real players.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Stories from James' own life provide a clear view of how to go about building your future.  His upfront and open style of writing is very refreshing.  I expect to reference this book many many times in the coming years.  Thanks James!
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|Why? Because it appears to be incompatible with my Viewsonic G-tablet. I know Froyo isn't new, but really... I look forward to a fix, and to giving a higher rating once that happens.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Interesting story, excellent and amusing writing. Ingratiating cast. Am watching it with my teenage daughter and we're bonding over it, in spite of the teenage sex.
B009NX409M|2.0|the acting was pretty good - but the plot of the movie is what stunk.  Of course, the plot is typical 'hollywood' mentality so you can take it for what it's worth.  NOT recommended at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game subway surfers. It is so fun. Me and my friend play it all the time and try to beat our high score. I love this game!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My granddaughter (age 9) is really the one who wanted this.  She hasn't put my Kindle Fire down since she got the game! She loves it.  Seems to be more complicated that just a point and shoot game, so I like that about it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not what I thought, but still a page turner. Having been compared to the sleeping beauty trilogy by Anne Rice, I expected more. Read the first book in paperback, borrowed from a friend. Purchased the second on the kindle. Going to purchase the first one (because I feel I need to have them all),and the third. A series of books that I will read again.
B006T3RM08|5.0|The best thing I can say about this product is I really haven't had to think about it since I installed it.<br /><br />Before I got it, I was constantly pushing my trackpad around the desk. No longer.<br /><br />The keyboard and trackpad snapped in without any modification or problems. Removal for battery replacement is very simple.<br /><br />IMHO it's a little expensive for a plastic tray, but it is well made and I am satisfied with the purchase.<br /><br />I do wish it came in silver to match the aluminum of the keyboard, but since the keys are white it still does not look out of place.
140053271X|4.0|Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :)
B00821OX98|4.0|Like most hollywood shows with guns, there are glaring technical inaccuracies, but the plot is compelling enough to keep you watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Did Jacob kill those two? I couldn't put this book down. Overwhelming evidence but not enough evidence. Parent s who loved him but had their doubts as well. And the ending.......well who saw that coming, not me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the second book, I could hardly wait to begin Mockingly. I needed to learn how Katniss would continue on. Katniss is a strong woman who perseveres through thick and thin. The ending to this story is bittersweet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it... it's a lot of fun since I just recently sold my horse. Keeps my mind off of her.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Familiar Queensryche elements and sounds are back, yet the music manages to progress in some new directions. This album sounds like modern take on a classic sound and is infinitely superior to the FU effort by G Tate.  The new singer fits the band perfectly. It's difficult to distinguish his voice from G Tate in tone and sound, except that the vocals are less center stage and work with the music rather than overwhelming the music with too many complex multi track harmony layers. Would love to have had this album with the original Queensryche lineup, but the this is still clearly Queensryche and not simply Tate with a serviceable cover band. Still miss Chris on guitars and never accepted Kelly as a replacement, so The G Tate Experience can have him. I like  Parker so far - so welcome aboard, and best wishes to you and the band!<br /><br />As for star rating, the album on it's own to me feels like a solid four. However, it arguably deserves a 5 star rating for those who are thrilled to see the band return to form and who wish to give them a \\"A\\" for effort and for overcoming the various challenges that faced them.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|As a dedicated Hanson fan, I don't even need to tell you that I love this album. Instead I will just issue out a massive thank you to these 3 boys (ehem... men) that have stayed true to their fans over these 21 years. Anthem IS in fact their best album yet because they as musicians and lyricists have grown and evolved over the years. It's inevitable. But I love that their sound has grown and not CHANGED. I really appreciate that they write their songs the way they want to, and not the way the radio says they should. They've stayed true to themselves and thus true to us as well. So thanks boys <3<br /><br />A bit of gushing though... \\"Lost Without You\\" and \\"Tragic Symphony\\" have been playing incessantly over the past couple of days. Beyond love them! I'll be honest, I haven't grown to love \\"Save Me From Myself\\" as the standard \\"last song ballad\\" just yet, but I'm sure it will grow on me.
B006RXQASA|3.0|Saw it years ago but seeing it a second time wasn't hilarious as the first time. First timers will love it.
B009MO5G90|3.0|This installment of the Resident Evil series seemed to be a rehashing of the previous films in the series, as if the writers couldn't come up with new storyline ideas.  As a standalone film it would be great with loads of action and sci-fi themes, but as the next installment of the Resident Evil saga I feel it took a few steps backward.  The epilogue that gives a glimpse into the next episode shows promise, though.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Wonderful acting and entertaining story.  The music was wonderful and the fact that many retired opera singers were used in the filming of this movie was amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great app to keep your mind sharp and work on memory skills. a very good app for cognitive training.
B006LSZECO|4.0|very interesting and a good read.  Did not like the ending, not at all believable.  Held my attention and interesting characters.
1416550534|5.0|Beautifully written, Kate Morton is a great writer who knows how to hold your attention.  She's a very descriptive writer who can bring out the beauty of the English countryside and turmoil of the crowded city.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|The Lincoln Lawyer kept my attention, with a decent, but not overly-complex plot.  Some parts were predictable, but, all in all, it was entertaining and enjoyable.
1416550550|5.0|One of the best books ever written, this book held my interest and I could hardly put it down.  Kate Morton is the greatest of writers.  Not many people can make you see and feel the wheels turning on the carts and hear the horses hooves as they strike the ground.  Awesome book.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It was a fun read. Light funny and delightful. Honest too... which was refreshing. Def worth the the bucks yep
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|episode blackwater had a defect and would skip or return to the start other than that it was very good
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great app! Plus, it's free!!! Very entertaining if you love puzzle games. Cannot wait for new levels to be added! I'm already so addicted!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I did not expect to like these books.  The first book was a gift and when I started reading the first one  I couldvnot stop.  I generally do not like fiction but this book was great reading.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This book certainly doesn't disappoint the fans of the S.F. series.  Great story despite the sometimes confusing science and the loss of old friends.  This is the reason for only 4 stars  instead of 5.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoy hidden object games. I will recommend this one to my friends.  Keep them. coming. G5. This one is challenging and has good graphics and story line.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The 3D in this movie was insane for a being a blue-ray. It was so intense at times I had to look away because I got dizzy. The movie itself was pretty good, I'm not the hobbit fan, my girlfriend is, and she loved it. So if your a hobbit fan you should too.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love it!!!! Crazy but amazing. This book sucks you in. I liked how crazy it became. I hop all the books are this wonderful.
0525948023|5.0|&#34;The Power of NOW&#34; and &#34; A New Earth&#34; must be read and practice in daily life. After finishing these two books, I found myself  I pay more attention each moment, spend more time with the joyful and playful dogs around Nature.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I really thought there wasn't much to this movie.  It was pretty boring, capitalized on cheap racial stereotypes and didn't even have that great of a performance by any character.  Quinton made his appearance as predicted.  I think his formula for filling a movie with gore, people getting killed in any way possible and insane story line was played out with the Kill Bill franchise.  I'd be nice to see something new and creative from him.
1451613512|5.0|Hard work, extensive research, numerous references which shed light from his angle to a difficult era in USA and world history!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Movie contained no foul language and just a little violence.  I think 3 people were killed.  Adults may find it a little juvenile.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The twists and turns keep you on edge but the characters ability to grow makes this series a must read!
B000002KHH|5.0|This is quite possibly my favorite heavy metal album of all time. Comes close to Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath has more originality and darkness, while Paranoid has a better song selection. Planet Caravan and War Pigs are prob my favorite songs on this album (Sleeping Village is my favorite Black Sabbath song)
B0088W4YTK|4.0|I never got a chance to see all of these episodes will this was airing. I so enjoy being able to watch commercial free now!
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Arnold! What else can be said about this great actor. Even at his age he still has some moves and still does it with style!
0425263924|5.0|After reading all the reviews about this trilogy I thought to myself why bother reading the book.  But here is why I finally decided to read it.  Nobody thinks the same way and everybody likes different things.  I went for it and I loved that I didn't lisent to what I read.  The story is different, the way it was excecuted is defferent.  Ok, it is about erotic pleasure, but in a different way, not like 50 Shades.  Trying to compare this trilogy to de 50 shades is not logical, (I read both the same week). Both trilogies are about the same thing, sex, but the story lines are different, so there can be no comparison between them.  If you like to read just go for it, do not compare the books, because if you do you will stop reading, since every romantic book is about the same thing, and every mystery book is about a mystery, ect (you get the point).  If you want to read it go ahead if you don't want to just don't, but just follow your wishes not what somebody writes here.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I loved it, was simple and easy and the time was really quick .  Worked what it said.  I would recommend it.

B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Airbourne is an awesome band and I love every single song they have ever written. This cd is terrific and straight up Rock N Roll. I see a long huge future for these guys. Pick this up, you won't be sorry!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I like the game I have it on my phone but I am unable to update it.  So know I have downloaded it to my nabi hopefully it will let me keep playing.  It didn't I threw my money away because they will not let me on the gqme anymore
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Sci-fi in the strictest sense of the word, this happenings in this book would be completely plausible in 20-30 years.  That being said, some of the things that happen to the main character are beyond belief (only in the sense that no one has that bad of luck).  I thought this book had a lot stronger storyline than a lot of the sci-fi I've read.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|fun game till an ad blocks the screen or some stupid film ad livid you off the game and you lose a shot
B007SGM084|5.0|LOL, adults only.  After Book One I began skipping the incessant orgasms looking for other action and found it.  Quite an entertaining read.<br />-Alan
B008VBYN80|2.0|At first I thought that this game was quite fun, but after continuing to play I found that many of the people in the community like to farm, and the random battle pair you w/t people who are way to far above a beginner s level. It is just another example of a money scam that claims 2 B free
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Loved it! I laughed out loud! Devoured every word and thoroughly enjoyed this book. And I can't wait to read another from this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this at least 10 times a week when waiting for the Zynga games to load so I don't Lose it mentally while waiting.<br /><br />thank you!
B00B1AZPCG|5.0|This show is so amazing and perfect for me. Castle and Beckett are so adorable and funny and I absolutely love them. The writers of this show are brilliant!!
B008CIUS72|3.0|We just loaded this app a couple of weeks ago and have not had time to review it.  So rating it at this time is not fair.<br />Thank you!<br />Janet
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a wonderful story about a young man who has successfully become a parasite on the social welfare system and an aristocrat who burns through home care helpers very quickly due to his difficult personality.  The fact that neither one cares for the other one's good opinion creates constant opportunities for poking fun, even with the serious themes underneath.  Later, after the relationship establishes between the two men, the verbal fencing which has become such an integral part of their interaction is still sharp edged, timely and, likely, universally human.  Even though it's a French movie and we are American, the jokes, pokes, and awkward situations made sense and were funny.  Generally, humor is difficult to convey across cultures. Oh, and the music is wonderful.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining way to waste time! I would have given 5 stars, however, after the last update, I lost all game progress and had to start all over. I wrote to Gameloft and they were unable to restore my game since all progress is saved to the device and not online. They did try to rectify the situation by compensating some cash and coins to try to make it easier for me to get back to the level that I was at. I'm happy with how they handled the issue. I love the game, so I'm still a happy gamer even with having to start all over.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|typical bruce willis &#34;kick ass&#34; drama-packed,action! I like all of the die hard movies,this one does not disappoint. 2 thumbs up!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is challenging and fun but it needs more levels. a lot like 100 floors but more complex. I am already hooked
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a very good book by Suzanne Collins. I think she is a good author. She is my favorite
6305807086|5.0|This is an unusual way to present two films which share many of the same actors. But don't be surprised because we have Charlie Kaufman as writer and Spike Jonze as director, who are not your normal filmmakers.<br />You can watch the films in order or mix them up. My preference is to begin with Adaptation, which easily merges with Being John Malkovich. Neither one is the normal Hollywood movie. In fact they don't even come close.<br />Being John Malkovich, which debuted at the end of the 20th Century, was seen by more people.<br />Many of the actors in the films were cast in roles that would not have been expected. Meryl Streep is a good example. Nicolas Cage was cast in a role similar to his performance in the Coen Brothers' film Raising Arizona. In fact, the Kaufman and Jones writer and director team could be confused with the Coen Brothers.<br />In this review I have left out the core of Being John Malkovich. More of you have seen that film and remember it. If not, check out some of the other reviews.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best one so far. But you can only make portals to the nether in survival also you can only blow up  TNT in survival.
B0034C9CFK|5.0|This CD has many great songs from a favorite, great entertainer. This is a great addition for any Alan Jackson collection.
B00BSO2U1Y|1.0|This set is probably the worst NORMA that has been recorded. Anyone who praises this either knows nothing about the opera (or opera at all) or is easily impressed.<br /><br />Bartoli is in good voice and executes the runs quite well. However, she chooses to over-emote at the wrong times when a legato line would serve much better. The tenor is far too light for Pollione, sounding like a cartoon. He'd be fine as Elvino, Nemorino, or Almaviva. The bass is merely acceptable. Conducting is horribly fast. This sounds like a cartoon, making a dramatic opera sound trivial. It would be fine as a $1 cut-out.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|To my ears and eyes Lady Antebellum is a great group. Some great and good songs to listen to and enjoy. But none with the punch of &#34;I Need You Now&#34;.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|The plot is generic enough to hold up but the dated film techniques and effects are painful in hd.  The climactic scene on the face of Mt Rushmore takes on a campy feel.<br /><br />Having said that,  Cary Grant still provides the classy screen presence with the right touch of humor that makes him memorable.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, it is a must see for Hitchcock fans.
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Cannot install on my Kindle. Save your money! Pinball Arcade works perfectly on any Kindle Fire. Shame on Zen Studios.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent book lots of action keeps you wanting to read until the end of the book looking forward to the one
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Extremely sturdy, snaps perfectly on the Kindle Fire, the price was right, and I love the bright red color (I can always find it)..
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack is my favorite game but there is a glitch that takes away my stuff including golden vehicles and king outfit that I used all my coins to buy<br />For example when I get off then get on the next day my golden vehicles or outfit will be gone and I have to purchase again and I checked it isn't equipping again it is purchasing
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed his first two books much more. There were to many unfinished episodes in this one. I recommend it if you like saga storie.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A good review can simply consist of saying it worked, as expected, and allowed me to view .pdf attachments in emails on my Android tablet....Thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the story of Eva and Gideon. It is the kind of love we all want. Money sure doesn't buy that kind of devotion. Can't wait to see what is next for them.Cudos to Sylvia Day with this series.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I was pleased with this choice because it allowed me to conveniently support my addiction to Spider Solitaire on my PC.<br />There was an almost miniscule re-learning curve on this one.<br />I can now enjoy the game outdoors in the morning with my first cup of coffee.
0062059963|3.0|This book could have been great, if the series is not concluded in the next book I will be very disappointed. America's feelings waffle back and forth between Aspen and Maxon, her opinions alter as her impressions of Maxon change.  Fleshing out Maxon's character was essential, however the book is only as long as it is do to America examining how she feels about the guys is just whiny and over played.  So by the end of the book the selection is still ongoing so another book is inevitable.  If however so much time hadn't been wasted readers could have gotten resolution from this book.  There are very gripping points, however in the end I was sorely disappointed to find out the series appears to just be being drawn out.
B0091REZMW|5.0|had alot of fun with this game I t<br />think its the best hidden item game ever it is a lot of fun and very nice way to kill time
0307744434|5.0|Captivating, enthralling, lovely.  I have a new favorite book.<br /><br />I checked this out from my library to read on Kindle (and the Kindle version was lovely; no frustrating formatting errors), but will pick up a paper version to keep in my permanent share library.  It's more than worthy.<br /><br />I haven't read anything this wonderful since Harry Potter, though this is a more adult, darker novel.  I mean adult in terms of \\"grown-up,\\" and not in terms of 'mature content,' which is alluded to once but otherwise quite absent.  The story only has 4 children of note, two of whom are painfully solemn.  Stardust or The Sandman by Neil Gaiman have a similarly dark grown-up feeling to them, if that helps you get your bearings on the wild but somehow sobering journey this book will take you on.<br /><br />The tale is expertly woven of whole cloth.  Do you hate dangling story threads or hastily, sloppily-resolved ends?  You'll find none of that here.  It's a masterful work.<br /><br />I loved every minute of it, and sympathized with a great host of characters.  Most of all, I empathized with the Dreamers:  circus patrons so utterly captivated by the fantastic, magical world of the Circus of Dreams that they pursue those dreams with steadfast dedication and rapturous joy.  I am ready to don my red scarf and pursue a circus of dreams.<br /><br />I won't ruin the wonderful surprises you have in store.  If you are reading this review, you are curious about The Night Circus.  If you are curious about The Night Circus, you must go.  For now, this book is the only portal I know to the Circus of Dreams, so I suggest you take it.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|i travel around the country alot due to my job and i pretty much dont actually get home for months and its awesome to have this with me when i go around. I pretty much use it every night when im relaxing in the hotel rooms with my xbox inside and its so easy to set up once you open it up.Whats even more awesome is that its allowed as a carry on on the plane and its not as heavy as you think and if you ever travel somewhere and you know youll have some free time or if you want to bring it to your friends house its a pretty good thing to buy and i love it.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Very slow. Locks screen often. Doesn't play video clips without freezing. I don't believe it is compatible with kindle fire 7.5!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for just sitting around the house, being bored. I enjoy how realistic the game is and entertaining.
1905236042|5.0|As a school physical therapist, I have long enjoyed using these cards as part of my lesson plan, the kids love them too!!! This was the 2nd set that I purchased because one my students is &#34;graduating&#34; from PT and these were her favorite activity in my room.  Whenever she could choose her PT activity, she chose Yoga Pretzels.  So i gave her the new set as a graduation gift.  Highly recommend these!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game  It's so much fun and the levels get harder and harder every time the levels have more things to find and do!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game! It's not so hard it's not fun but makes you think a bit too. Highly recommend! Update soon!!
0525953728|4.0|I enjoyed the honest dialogue.  It's the entire story of a seal not just the Osama episode, it allows you to get a fuller picture.
1439127727|5.0|The book gives a whole new dimension of how problems seen from the perspective of the presidency and how decisions are made.  It is fascinating!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Typical mother/daughter coming of age angst.<br />Nice to have a mother AND a father in a loving relationship.<br />The animation is great, storyline easy to follow.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have been using this app for its alarm clock feature.  It is great.  Nice gentle way to wake.  Very handy also when traveling.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Digital Special Effects are so commonplace in movies and TV that I find I just expect them in a movie.  I am now wowed by movies that are special but with much smaller armies listed in the credits and with subtle special effects.  This movie has lots of digital sequences, and has several armies in the credits.  I have to say they are well executed.  They are not surprising, but they are fun.  The movie is enjoyable.<br /><br />I have struggled to determine what I consider to be missing.  I think it is that, ultimately, this is a story based on the imagination of L. Frank Baum.  It certainly captures Baum's imagery and story, and it does so with Baum's evident desire to \\"soften\\" violence.  That it does this by softening any moral is the problem.  What does the Wizard really learn?  What about the witches?  What does any of the characters learn?  There are probably as many opinions as there are viewers.<br /><br />So, viewing the movie is fun, enjoyable, and in keeping with what modern critics of L. Frank Baum think.<br /><br />But, critics have never understood Mr. Baum.  I will say this: he could deliver dead-on sarcastic wit with such kindness and in so few words, most people miss his point entirely.  Well, the makers of this movie did too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the book... Khaled is amazing.... Loved the kite runner, loved thousand splendid suns, and now I have another favorite! And the mountains echoed!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I got this app awhile ago and it was really fun, the one day I adjusted the quality settings and then I couldn't open it. I had to uninstall it then reinstall it, but it didn't save any of my progress. sometimes its skippy but its really fun.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am a long time Tina Fey fan so when the price dropped on her book, I jumped to get it. I have laughed out loud while reading this. I had no idea the struggled 30 Rock had, but Tina shows it. Her meeting with Sarah Palin was hilarious.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a well developed physics based game for people of all ages. I loved it so much I finished the entire game in 2 days. :)
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen and perhaps the best actress of the last 30 years.  Bravo!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was only a partial novel :(<br />I am looking forward to the next book to finish the story that Entwined started.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I had these movies on regular DVD and love them... But was always left wondering how much better they would be on bluray.... Audio and picture quality in my unqualified opinion is far superior and made this great series even better and more fun to watch!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with you was the best book so far. It of course left me wanting more of Eva and Gideon! Excellent if I could give 100 stars I would
B002SRQ214|4.0|Upgraded from an Athlon II to this.  Price is great, but from a power perspective is really noticeably slower than my primary Core-i5 rig.  Seems to be similar in power to a 1st gen Core-i5, or a laptop i5.  Maybe those are unfair comparisons due to price and age of the chip...just providing info.  Certainly helped boost our home server of the dual core Athlon II
1476729719|1.0|I've read most of Jodi Piccoult's novels and this one was probably the most disappointing to me. First, this book jumps back and forth between so many character viewpoints and time frames that it took me at least 1/3 of the book before I could easily remember which character was who when I saw their name. I also often got confused between what time period she was talking about and would have to double back to the opening title of that section to see when she was writing about. Second, it was way depressing. The characters are extremely unlikeable and the entire atmosphere of the school she depicted is ghastly. I'm sure some places may be like what she described but I can't remember ever seeing anyone bullied the way she describes, or dealing with such heavy, depressing issues that she writes about. Honestly, the book for that reason alone was not entertaining to me, but a huge weight around my shoulders. Third, the book is WAY drawn out. By 2/3 of the way through the book I was skipping through most of the sections trying to filter out the \\"juice\\" and by the time I reached the now predictably dramatic twist which is cornerstone of her novels, I was completely disappointed to find that it offered no resolution or sense of justice and fell about as flat as it could have. I have read almost all of Picoult's novels and aside from The Pact, this was by far the most depressing and disappointing. No idea how so many people have given it 5 star reviews.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|As a breast cancer survivor, I related to Anita's views on the medical community as a whole, cancer treatments, cancer information available and especially her views on how she saw herself in her past and how she sees herself now. I could have written much of that myself. I believe that people (and things) come into your life for a reason and when they are suppose to. It was no accident that I was watching Wayne Dyer on public TV that day. No accident that Anita was on his program. No accident that I felt compelled to download her book immediately. No accident that YOU are reading this right now! I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this book has CHANGED MY LIFE!  I love myself for the first time in my 53 years of life! I see things different now. Colors are brighter, the wind feels different and (some) people are not so ugly or weird to me ;) Above all else I'm calmer, worry less and am much happier. We are ALL connected, we are ALL magnificent! Enjoy this book. It is quite the story. BLESSINGS!
0143119680|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is a paranormal romance for the intellectually curious. The author turns her scholarly pursuits to vampire and witch lore, mythology, religion, history, alchemy, medicine, genetics and geography. It was fascinating and enlightening. I finished the book almost believing that these unique creatures really do exist. The book is the first in the All Souls trilogy, and it ends with the two main characters (Diana the witch and Matthew the vampire)timewalking back to the 16th century to hide from the Congregation and prepare for war. As such, I can hardly wait to dig in to Shadow of Night: A Novel (All Souls Trilogy), the 2nd in the trilogy. I highly recommend this book for fans of the paranormal genre. There is much to discover in A Discovery of Witches, and it's carefully and beautifully written.<br /><br />Favorite words:<br /><br />parterres<br />oubliette<br />sybaritic<br /><br />Ideas to discuss:<br /><br />Understanding your own power<br />Accepting your true self<br />Mastering fear<br /><br />Conversation to strike up:<br /><br />If you could timewalk, where and when would you go?<br /><br />Favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"As I am the end, so my lover is the beginning.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it's so fun and I have loads of fun playing it. Its hard when it gets fast but that makes it better.it's so much fun you will enjoy it.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|People will always say for the best gaming experience go with a i5 processor. Well their wrong. All of my latest games and earlier cpu intensive games run well on this cpu. Case in point it only ran at 44% when playing even my most intense games! At 55 watts this processor definitely packs a punch! I was opt. for an i5 but hey if I can run all of my games and then some without stuttering/ freezing on an i3 why not? Even the onboard HD 4,000 graphics can play some new titles maxed out at 1080p! It also helps if you have high frequency DDR3 memory installed, the more memory and higher frequency the more fluid it gets. I'm currently using 1600mhz, 8gb memory.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This is definitely a great movie, because it is what is. Most of the negative reviews I see are because people don't understand it is a horror comedy made in the 80's with B movie acting, lots of gore and many chessy special effects. It wasn't meant to be a Oscar nominated film. It was meant to be just a very fun entertaining film. If you understand that and enjoy this type of film, you will have no problem with this film. If you don't like this at all, you may want to skip this movie and a negative review.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be very addictive and challenging. It was hard to put it down once I started playing. The only issue I have is with the instructions; they are very sparse and unclear. A demo would have been helpful. Nevertheless I still found the game addictive and look forward to additional levels.
B000WC3864|5.0|I love this movie! Unlike most horror films nowadays, this film is great, because it was made in a time without CGI, and all effects were man made and done well. Don't get me wrong I still love most horror films today, but some rely too much on CGI. It still had the scary, creepy horror factor. It may not be nearly as scary today as it was when it was made, but it is still a very fun entertaining film!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love that it is challenging !! it is neat to figure out things and it gets tougher at each level. a great game.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I had no idea what the ending would be. Total mystery, which makes it totally awesome. It was intense and alluring at the same time.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Started a little slow, but by the end of the season I was completely invested. Without giving away any spoilers for this season there are definitely some twists.
076535618X|5.0|John Perry probably never thought he'd have a rougher job than as ombudsman for his colony.  That is, until an &#34;old army buddy&#34; shows up and sends their small family off to another planet to act as Colony Administrators.  Things seem to be going smoothly, until they arrive and discover that they are not where they thought they were, in fact, they don't even know where they are. With strange creatures moving outside their small emplacement, the colonists are faced with everyday life or death situations, but find themselves facing an ultimatum that will either wipe them out or make them &#34;The Last Colony&#34;<br /><br />Scalzi's storyline keeps a fast pace throughout the book, and you don't have much chance to get adjusted to one situation before you're surprised by another one from a different direction.  I enjoyed every page of the book, and hopefully, you will, too.
B00008G8M4|4.0|This was a great, fast action film. There were many funny moments. Caution for parents, one of the characters is a stripper, and they briefly show her scantily clad working at her job. There was some rude humour and swearing, as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an app you just got to get!!! It's minecraft in your pocket that's awesome because the computer version is better (in my opinion) but that costs like $20.00 but this is just like that and for what???  $7.00 how much better can it get????  (don't answer because I know it can.)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just bought this game today and love it! It takes a few minutes to figure out what to do but once you figure it out you are addicted. I love games in which you have puzzles to solve.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it. Loved the characters, the story's progression, and the idea. I went from wondering if something like this could happen to when will it. Bravo Mr. Howdy, well done.
0425263924|1.0|After reading the first two books and waiting for half a year for the third, I can't express how truly disappointed I was in not only the book, but the author.  I just don't understand how it went from something of a phenomenal literary work to just plain tabloid junk!  Gideon and Eva were nothing like they were in the first book.  Their characters were irrevocably destroyed by the trash presented in the third book.  If I wanted a complete rehashing of the first two books, I would have re-read them!  Which I did!  I didn't need any reminders in the third.  It's not like it was intended as a stand alone novel!  Her father finds out she was molested and he just comes to visit?  No real conversation taking place about it? He just flew across country to act as a tourist?  Oh yeah, and had sex with his ex?  Why was that necessary?  We already know Gideon 'killed' her molester.  Why raise questions of her father's involvement or for the Russian mob?  Close the case already!  The detective did!  And the 'disappearance' of Megumi?  Why?  What does this have to do with anything?  The miscarriage?  Please!!  Now about Eva and her 'devotion' to Gideon yet she is entertaining singer?  Really?  Really?  Knowing how Gideon acted the first time?  Planing on meeting up with him when she is out west?  The only believable thing in the whole book was Cary getting his girlfriend, and I use the term loosely, pregnant.<br /><br />Will I stick around and read the next two installments?  Probably not.  This book spoiled it for me. There is no way the author can redeem herself or restore the characters to their former glory, unless there is a shower scene like in Dallas!<br /><br />Sorry, but whomever gave Ms Day advice to stretch the original trilogy into 5 books, gave bad advice!  No doubt I am not the only one who feels this way.<br /><br />Shame on you, Ms Day!<br /><br />By the way, I returned the book for a full refund!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game so far and I just started I'm excited to see all you can do, very addicting and best part is that it's FREE....great for all ages please try
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game that makes you think. Not too hard to make you stop playing, but not too easy to make it feel like a children's game.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Superlatives aside, this movie is a must-see for anyone who values their freedom.  But for those who don't care about being free, they should continue to text their friends and/or play their video games.<br /><br />In every way, this is a stunning production.  Acting, script, plot, cinematography, direction - it all comes together with a film like this.  . . . .  Plus, it (should) make us all think; not just about freedom, but also about the fear we hold inside that keeps us from stepping forward to claim our freedom.<br /><br />A magnificent production, I highly recommend it!
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I was surprised that this series could equal it's predecessor, but it has!  Am I the only one who finds McKay humorous?  In fact I think it's as humorous as it is exciting.  Two great qualities in fine entertainment!
B005ES1CZ0|5.0|Got these for mother of my grandchildren, who works in a hospital.  She'd worn out the other Crocs I got her several years ago, and she deserves pampering now and again.  She loves her mother-in-law and that's the way I like it.
B000NQPZCY|3.0|Different version of the movie, I bought it but I don't like it very much. It is an excellent movie though.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The sad and suspense was what made the books so great , the passion in the writing is amazing, inspiring, and entertaining THE best books I have ever read. Amazing work Mr. Dashner keep writing. Maybe a sequel in the wilderness with new hardships.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Loved the twist and turns.  Never anticipated the ending.  He is just so good keeping us guessing.  A really good read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book a number of times and have nothing bad to say about it. I am eagerly awaiting the movie. I hope it does the book justice.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|This is AA best work since they put out With Oden on our Side.  It might be their most melodic to date but they sound more brutal on this album than they did on Surtur and Twilight.<br /><br />1. Deceiver of the Gods - Good opening Track 4.5/5<br />2. As Loke Falls - Probably my favorite track.  Very heavy, very melodic. Makes me want to go to war. 5/5<br />3. Father of the Wolf - This one sounds like they took it from Surtur.  Very good riffage on this song. 4/5<br />4. Shape Shifter - Not really feeling this one. 3/5<br />5. Under Siege - Wow, another brilliant song.  The riffs on this song are amazing. 5/5<br />6. Blood Eagle - Another great song. You can hear a definite Slayer influence on this song 4.5/5<br />7. We Shall Destroy - This sounds like it was pulled directly from Vs The World, my favorite AA album. 5/5<br />8. Hel - eh, it's ok. 3/5<br />9. Coming of the Tide - Fast, brutal and good riff. I like. 4/5<br />10. Warriors of the North - Great way to close the album. 4/5<br /><br />If I had to rank with other AA albums:<br /><br />1. Vs The World<br />2. With Oden on our Side<br />3. The Avenger<br />4. Deceiver of the Gods<br />5. Once Sent from the Golden Hall<br />6. Twilight of the Thunder God<br />7. The Fate of Norns<br />8. Surtur Rising<br />9. The Crusher<br /><br />This is a must buy album.  Get it!
B007A2O3FO|5.0|saw this at the theater, was very glad when it came out as DVD.  I shared this with my sister and she loved it as much as I did.  Maggie Smith is one of our favorite actresses.
B00005AVTW|1.0|It did not work in my DVD player.  Message said wrong region.  Never saw this before so I looked it up and the DVD was formatted for Australia.  Returned.  Plastic DVD box was not factory tapes so not sure what this is about.
B008RXYOKY|1.0|If you only have a couple of FireWire devices daisy chained together, then you are OK.<br /><br />Not the case for those pros that have been depending on FireWire as a standard for years. If you have two Quad drive boxes connected together, or an eight drive box, you won't be able to use this adaptor!<br /><br />The fact is that you must count the TOTAL of all the devices that will be on the one Thunderbolt port, no more than seven allowed!!! This can be very restrictive, especially since the previous protocol, FireWire allowed 62 devices in the daisy chain!<br /><br />I have a 15 drive FireWire daisy chain for around 22 TB that has been working just fine for years on my previous Mac and now I am unable to use all this gear! The adaptor is NOT a solution! Thunderbolt is not really ready for prime time yet!<br /><br />BUT BEWARE, when you do connect a daisy chain as large as mine to these new Macs all hell breaks loose! Since I started using the adaptor the same day I got the new Mac, it took four months to figure this all out. Now Apple is taking my new Retina MacBook Pro back and giving me a full refund!

B004TNGLW0|1.0|The movie is great, however; paying 300.00 for scarface limited box edition humidor is just another way for the manufactures to get you too pay 300.00 for movie.  Great resolution ....PURCHASE ONLY THE MOVIE.

0786955554|4.0|I've been able to implement these very easily into gameplay. I use them alongside the chessex megamat and the grids are even the same size, so you can outline dungeons and when players get to the rooms you can place the tile so they see that room only when they're in it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it works, but did not solve my problem  had to have my kindle replaced, amazon was very promped with that

B007EE4XKI|5.0|You know you've found a good book when you're captured within the first few pages, can't bear to put it down in the middle, and are satisfied at the end yet saddened because you still want more. Not more because of its story was empty, but more because it was so enjoyable, you want it to go on forever. I can't say much else without giving away details. It's an adventure from start to finish, part of it reading like a diary. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. David Mack writes the story of Star Trek with such passion and respect for the legend. You will never be disappointed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I recommend this game because it's awesome and works great with my iPad,iPod touch, kindle fire, and iPhone. Get this game
B0045INOCO|4.0|Pretty good but took a while to get to it.  Made the good guys look incompetent a little too much I thought but some of the sequences were good and I took it at face value.  Don't look for a lot of redeeming social value.  Could have been about 30 minutes shorter.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is just like Mario. It's amazing I don't have any problems with the game. It works great on my kindle fire, iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game is much it's addictive. I play it all day long. Well not all day. But whatever this game deserves a 5 star rating. You need this app PLUS ITS FREE. That's the best part. Well I hope you guys enjoy this game as much as I do.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three books in the trilogy and I am very sad that we won't hear any more of Salander and Blomkvist.  I have rarely been this drawn into a series.  Excellent books!
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Great story, excellent characters, and superb acting.<br />I've watched this movie many times and highly recommend for ages 13 and up.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great book. I love fantasy series that pull you into a world and you become consumed with it, and this one does not disappoint.

B000XO2R22|5.0|I was introduced to Beck by the TV show \\" Life\\" staring Damian Lewis and his rendition of \\" Everybody's Got to learn sometime.\\" I was so disapointed to find that his version was replaced on the DVD of the episode. It changed the entire feeling of the scene. I had to investigate this mysterious singer. I was able to find out who he was on a website which identified background music on tv shows.I have been in love with Beck since.  Lonesome Tears is the song that most haunts me on this disc. By the way I am Black and I play anything and everything in my car and this introduces my friends and family to other styles of music often. My sister now loves this and has asked me to play it when she wants to relax and I am driving.

B00004Y2QT|5.0|Prince roxx tha house again.  I love the live version of Purple rain the best on here.  it's a fantastic version.  The only thing I didn't like about this concert was the Lenny Kravitz section of the concert.  I really am not a fan of his music and he does not sound good live at all, sorry!  He didn't fit in to the concert so I will prob. skip that whole part in the future.  I love all of the Prince and The Time performances, and I love Prince's get ups, especially the gypsy outfit towards the end of the concert.  I think Prince looks so good in hoodies and scarves, i luv it.  The bonus stuff is ok, I wish he would have thrown in the whole video for Greatest Romance, I liked the clips from the concert.  I'm wondering where this was filmed, Paisley Park?  it looked like every1 had a fantastic time and I'm glad they filmed it for peeps like me who havent seen it.  I will b watching it again a bout a hundred times.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I have installed this application because I just wanted to test it and I could not stop playing. The game includes several levels. I would be great if the game showed to the user the best possible solution to each level after the match.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I luv Gwen and that's the whole draw to No Doubt now so I hear this as a solo thing in a way. I luv the songs \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Looking Hot\\", some of Gwens best stuff!  Alot of the beats on this record are amazing and I need to hear some of the other songs again and give them a chance, but this cd is hot, don't believe the negativity, Gwen is the queen of No Doubt.

B004J4XGN6|4.0|“The big question of our time is not Can it be built? But Should it be built?” (273)<br /><br />One of the greatest challenges in startups is deciding how to utilize limited resources that include financial and human capital resources. As companies develop “the startup has to constantly re-evaluate its strategy and ask – should we pivot or persevere” (51) Should the company persevere and push forward with its current strategy, vision, and product plan or should it pivot – change direction, realign its scarce resources and admit sunk costs.<br /><br />  Eric Reis in The Lean Startup outlines three key steps to answering the question of whether the company should be building the product. First, he advocates the release of the minimal viable product or MVP. Second, he advocates validated learning in which the company rigorously evaluates the current strategy by asking if it should “pivot or persevere.” And third, he advocates that single-piece flow in production.<br /><br />He writes, “The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. The minimum viable product lacks many features that may prove essential later on. However, in some ways, creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact… Remember, if we’re building something that nobody wants, it doesn’t much matter if we’re doing it on time and on budget.” (77)<br /><br />Throughout the book he reiterates the necessity to validate key assumptions about future products. He exclaims, “The big question of our time is not Can it be built? But Should it be built?” (273) Further, Reis discusses the Japanese motto: Genchi Gembutsu­: “go and see for yourself”. The product designers, he insists, must have ‘deep firsthand knowledge’ about the customer and the customer’s problem that the product intends to solve.<br /><br />  Finally, to succeed in producing the MVP Reis advocates “single-piece flow” in which the production batch size is one. Small batch sizes, he explains, allow us to find out almost immediately where the problem is in our system. (Chapter 9)<br /><br />The Key questions to ask:<br /><br />1)  “Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?<br />2)  If there was a solution, would they buy it?<br />3)  Would they buy it from us?<br />4)  Can we build a solution for that problem?” (64)in producing the MVP Reis advocates “single-piece flow” in which the production batch size is one.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is an excellent MMO gaming mouse. I have played extensively with the Razer Naga and the WOW Cataclysm mouse. I wasted money on the beautiful but clunky Corsair Vengance MMO mouse, which, thanks to baffling software and stiff buttons, was virtually useless.<br /><br />The Anker mouse has intuitive, easy to use software. It has optional weights (I like a hefty feel.) It has responsive, well positioned thumb-side buttons for skills. They are easy to identify by touch. It has instant DPI switching. It has a sturdy braided cord.The price is well below similar mice.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! Icons are nice and big, and it's so easy to use! But I LOVE that what ever I'm working on doesn't get erased if I have to walk away from it for a while! I can just click the app, and there's my math problem, just as I left it! Awesome App, Definite recommend!

0393327655|3.0|I really like Sam Harris and have seen a couple of lectures with him and have always enjoyed his style. The End of Faith is the book that really put Sam Harris's name on map as one of the forerunners of the New Atheism. Unfortunately this book has a few flaws. His tirade against Muslims are a bit one dimensional and though I do agree that it is primarily their religion that drives them to perform acts of terrorism. It is not the only reason. Muslims from Indonesia, Malaysia and other parts of Asia is not performing terrorism, it is primarily Arab Muslims that performs these heinous acts. That could have been elaborated on some more.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book should have been left out. Here Sam Harris starts to blabber about eastern mysticism and in process completely retards what is meant by empirical evidence. The east is not better than the west, as Harris more that hints to, in understanding he human mind. Most Asian countries places little value on human life and well being. This is true even of more develop places such as Japan and South Korea.<br /><br />Don't start with The End of Faith if you are interested in reading some of the New Atheism literature, God is Not Great by the late Christopher Hitchens and The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins is better places to start. If you want to read about the dangers of faith Victor J Stenger's book God and Folly of Faith is also a better bet.<br /><br />The End of Faith is classic among the New Atheism literature, but it is not one of the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun but I wish there was all the stuff on the computer version on the pocket edition!!!!!!!
B003VWU2WA|5.0|This device is well known amongst SDR users and popular. I am very happy with the unit. It performs as expected and does exactly what I want.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Not that I need proof, but may be a great book to recommend to friends and family that are sceptics about the afterlife and The Kingdom of God
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's a really fun game! I don't know why they take 1 picture of you doing somethin throughout the game...anyways haha you should get the game is really fun and apparently about 2000 people agree with me!:D
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Nice to be able to watch with the family again and not have to pay movie prices or movie refreshment prices.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|its great for people that  like  Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series its funny and cool and great for every age and good to read over and over again .LOVE IT
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Must have forgotten to order when it became available. Kids will watch over and over for a couple years for sure.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Very intuitive. Very easy. This is just what I was looking for in an alarm clock app.  Highly recommended. Love it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is gripping and well written. The book has more depth than the movie and I'm glad I read this before seeing the movie. The series as a whole is well set.
B008MM9630|4.0|I have enjoyed this game and plan to play often. There is a cash component but if you are very patient you don't need as much as you think.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is an excellent read. Not only is it exciting, but it also takes the time to delve into the curious relationship of two teenagers, their families, and the friendship of adult women.<br /><br />This novel left me with a new perspective. Things are NOT always as they seem...and love can be quite harmful. I recommend this to EVERYONE...especially teenagers and their parents.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great Sylvia Day book. The saga of Gideon and Ava continues to keep the reader captivated. Looking forward to seeing more books about one of my favorite fictional couples.
1401307787|5.0|Jon Kabat-Zinn presents a clear, calm, compelling case for why meditation and mindfulness are so beneficial, and also practical material for how to incorporate these ideas into one's daily, modern life without going to any extremes. Well-written, thoughtful, and thought-provoking.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I read the book before seeing the movie and the book is much better. The characters and story line are fully developed and the suspense builds with a good surprise at the end. Just goes to show that a good book beats a good movie.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|When Black Sabbath is putting out an album in which their producer tried desperately to try to get Tony and company to sound like old Sabbath, it is refreshing to hear old rockers like Deep Purple just put out an album that seems so natural, so groove-laden, and fun to listen to. Don't get me wrong, I like the new Sabbath (13), but it is a little contrived. This Deep Purple album is great. To me, it really cements the Steve Morse DP as a legitimate era in the band's history; one that can examined on it's own merits, without the Blackmore discussions. Richie is making medieval music with his wife, could we stop talking about him. You know all the Morse haters comments are just veiled attempts at saying he's not Blackmore. Both are great guitarists, but completely different. I'm stating the obvious. Onto the album, \\"Now What ?!\\": The songs flow very nicely and the album has it's heavier moments, but when the big riffs come it seems right and natural. It's not like 60 year olds trying to \\"rock out\\" like the young folk- like I said just a real natural sounding piece of work. Bravo, gentlemen. It'll be enjoying this one all summer.
B000002BPS|5.0|&#34;Ixnay on the Hombre&#34; certainly doesn't disappoint when stack-up up to &#34;Smash.&#34; It's certainly not identical in sound, but I prefer the new sound; you'll notice that the production value is also significantly superior on the Offspring's first major label release. There's also a lot of variety present on this album; there's the softer-sounding ballads, like &#34;Gone Away,&#34; but there's no shortage of driving punk classics, like &#34;Cool to Hate.&#34;<br /><br />If you like Smash, I'd reccomend it. It still has that classic Offspring sound to it, while still offering something new.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Same here as with Kiss meets the Phantom. Gotta have that list !!! LOve all VCR movies !! Again where is that list ???
B004P12SSW|5.0|I have this movie and cant stop watching it. The music is wonderful. People in movie did a very good job acting. Cher is very good she hasn't lost it yet. Cant wait to watch again. I really like musicals.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|From the first cut on the CD to the last, I love every song! Not only is Josh Groban's voice incredible, but the musicians behind him are so first class. This CD is a must have for every Josh Groban fan.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This was a very good movie. The actors and actress were very good. I really liked all the people in the movie. Im not a big fan of opera but, this was good . It show that retirement homes are not the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app incorporated aspects of a well thought out hidden object game with a bent toward logic. I really enjoyed it. I can't wait for the upgrade.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best app I have ever played on Kindle fire I enjoy the graphics very much.  The downside is being stung by jellyfish every time you pass one.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I choose this rating because this book truly inspired me. It taught me the balance between the body, mind, diet, and life. It most importantly taught me that if you want success you must be able with both your mind and body to be able to work harder than you think you can. This book was truly life changing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the book and the series can't wait for the next book to arrive.  I have already pre-ordered.<br />Yhe romance is great.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Good suspense, takes an unexpected turn half way through which was well executed. Well acted particularly by Rooney Mara and Jude Law.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to pass the time. I reallly enjoy playing this game. Good graphics and quite realistic for a a simple game.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Initially, i started watching later episodes and thought it was pretty cheesy - typical for a series of this genre. But after watching the first season and getting some of the back story, what I thought was poor acting from the main character turned out to be an understandable portrayal of someone dealing with serious emotional trauma. A refreshing twist on some of the more conventional super hero stories. More Batman than Spider-Man.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Really good. I just wish it was cheaper. I would love to see Final Fantasy 7 on Android and iOS next.
B002RI9MWA|3.0|I enjoyed this book for the first 95% of its contents.  It is about a young Pakistani man who makes good in the posh American higher educational system, and then finds an excellent corporate job in New York.  He falls in love with a young American woman from a wealthy family.  The major theme (I think) is that of alienation when one is a foreigner, despite apparent assimilation and success.  He quits his job when his loved one disappears, and returns to Pakistan.  He recounts his story to an unknown American man in a cafe in Islamabad.  His experiences seem to have embittered him.  The book is beautifully written, really capturing the cadences of a Pakistani speaking English and drawing you into the man's life.  But the ending was to me a total cop out.  if you love ambiguity, you will like this book better than I did in the end.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Kindle Singles are a treat if you are busy and have little free time to commit to more lengthy reading. This was my first Nick Hornby read and I really like his style. I had seen the movie About A Boy so I was expecting something good. The book's characters were easy to relate to (not that I fancy myself to be the same as them) and the prose keep me turing the pages :)
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|A band with true musical talent and creativity.  I like Babel better than Sigh No More, which was their first album and was also awesome.  Babel seems to have more maturity and soul.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|good time killer, plenty of challenges and variety, also tilt option is well suited for this game, thank you nick
B007L3BMGA|3.0|It was ok. Sometimes the sex scenes tend to drag the story out. Overall a good book an I would recommend to others to read.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I liked the product. I recommend to all, because the product and quality.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD of Season 3 of Downton Abbey! The 3 disks contain all the episodes plus some really interesting special features that take you behind the scenes and into the world of Downton. The image quality is wonderful and the show is absolutely amazing. If you're never seen Downton Abbey, I highly recommend you do asap!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|first off the game is free<br />second its amazing<br />that's all you need to know<br />so go out and download the game<br />no don't hesitate<br />don't smile either just do it
159463176X|5.0|What a wonderful, powerful book! I could not wait on the library list (I was about #20), so I bought it on Amazon. If you liked Kite Runner and 1000 Splendid Suns, you will not be able to put this book down!
0062255657|5.0|Wow! One of the truly artistic books I have read.  Fairy tale for adults.  Beautiful and amazing and wonderous.  Definitely read this one.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love this game. Whenever im trying to kill some time this is what i play. My kids love it too.
0226443221|1.0|The editor's description begins with this:<br /><br />\\"Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined.\\"<br /><br />This is actually false, unless they are categorizing \\"heat waves\\" as natural disasters and excluding \\"cold snaps\\" from that category.  More people die from cold weather than heat, and the difference is significant.  With that kind of misleading information right on the website, I have to assume that the book is full of this kind of inaccurate information or manipulated statistics, so why would I want to read something like that?
B00005LMBK|4.0|Very good album. I love every song in it but the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is cause of the condition of the case. It was very scratched but i guess I should have expected that considering I got it used and the c.d. it self is from 2001.
B004R6JG7G|4.0|I gave this as a Father's Day gift.<br />My husband's favorite movie and he is thrilled with the quality of the movie.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of Tom Hanks best and I'm glad to have it. It shipped fast and was in good condition. Get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. My sisters love this games. I love to feed the horses. And i think the creator of this game is a genius.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Very very good movie. One that you can watch over and over and it will never get old. Being a huge fan of this super hero I had to have the movie and I wanted nothing less then the best so I got this blu ray two disc edition. I got it used and it was flawless. Not a single mark on the disk and even the slip cover was in great condition. Buy it!!!
B005IQZB14|3.0|Book did not appeal to me too much.  I had trouble relating to her situation and why she wouild attempt such a difficult challenge.
B000003CKH|4.0|The songs are pretty good and there is only like 2 I'm not the biggest fan of but the C.D. it self was in absolutely perfect condition.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very good graphics! There is a lot of things to do but it's fast paced.  The competitions are fun to accomplish. This is a great games for kids though they may need assistance if Young.<br />paced
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried other Word apps for creating documents on my tablets and this is the best. They are always improving it, so that it is easier to use. Flipping back and forth to adjust for font size or type can be burdensome if you are expecting to highlight certain words or phrases, so it's easier to just highlight in yellow or another color and make bigger changes later. I have had this on 3 devices now. One app from a different company would lock up and twice deleted entire files. I love this app because it has never failed me like that. (You just have to buy a new copy for each device.)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Played this app for almost 2 days. App is fun! Still not sure it it is worth .99. I will give it a couple more days and decide.
B0054SMIH6|1.0|After reading all the accolades for this movie, I decided to watch it on my TV via my Roku; however, I am at a disadvantage.  I have hearing problems and really need to have CC for much of the dialogue.  I am not able to see this Prime video movie with CC.  This is a fairly new movie and I am surprised this isn't included. Am I missing something?
B00199B2Z8|4.0|The only thing that would have made this book any better: Double its length! I could read this stuff all day.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed Slammed.  I am relatively new to contemporary young adult books and I'm really surprised by how much I have been enjoying them!  I knew this was a very highly rated YA contemporary, plus I need to read [[ASIN:1476715920 Point of Retreat: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1476746532 This Girl: A Novel]] for Netgalley, so I decided to give this a try.  Actually, I had planned on reading a different book before this one, and I just wanted to browse the first few pages of Slammed to see if I thought it was any good or not, but instead I kept reading and I ended up finishing it in less than 24 hours, and it has been a while since I have done that.  I honestly wasn't too sure about reading it beforehand because the idea of poetry sort of turns me off, because far too often I just don't get it, but in this book it does enhance the story and you don't have to analyze it to death to understand the meaning behind it.<br /><br />The secret that is revealed about why their relationship is forced to end surprised me, I wasn't expecting that and I certainly wasn't expecting the reveal to happen so soon.  Normally in a book where there is a forbidden relationship I get frustrated because there never seems to be much happening besides a bunch of whining about the inability to be together, but this book was different.  One reason is because I could completely understand why their relationship couldn't work, given the situation. Also, there always seemed to be something else happening in the story that allowed it to still progress and not just stay stuck in neutral, if that makes any sense at all.<br /><br />I loved Layken and Will, and Eddie, Kel, and Caulder.  All of them were endearing and appealed to my emotions in some way.  All of them have endured some tragic event that contribute to who they are, which makes the maturity level of Layken, Will, and Eddie believable.  I just kept wishing and hoping for Lake and Will to find some way to be together!  And Eddie was a great addition to the story.  She was the exact kind of friend that Lake needed because she had her own issues in life so she understood the severity of her and Will's situation.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more for fear of ruining the book for anyone else, but I can say that this book has thrown off my reading schedule.  I had other books that I needed to read before this series, but there is no way that I can't pick up Point of Retreat next!  I would absolutely recommend this book for people of all ages!dition to the story.  She was the exact kind of friend that Lake needed because she had her own issues in life so she understood the severity of her and Will's situation.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more for fear of ruining the book for anyone else, but I can say that this book has thrown off my reading schedule.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|My only complaint?  It ended too soon!  Way too many unanswered questions.  And no publish date for the next installment...or at least one that I can find.  Sylvia...what gives?
B009IH0ICG|5.0|So simple to use.  Took the frustration out of starting a charcoal fire.  I find myself grilling more often now.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This stroller organiser is fantastic for my City Mini. There are 2 cup holders on each end with a good sized middle area between to hold snacks, keys, phone, wallet, etc.<br /><br />The organiser attaches to the handlebar via velco so you can adjust it to your needs. The depth of the organiser is sufficient so you don't need too worry about things falling out.<br /><br />There is a smell when you first take it out of the packaging but because it will stay strapped to the stroller in your apt/home/any ventilated area, the smell will quickly dissapate.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. And given the many many positive reviews, so do many other parents (as this seems to acccomodate various stroller brands and models)
0783231032|5.0|If, like me, you have seen this movie a hundred times and felt that there was something missing, this version fills in all the blanks!!!!!

B000063V8U|5.0|I now have all the Next Generation series and also watching it as I can't think of a better TV series to watch.
0805092447|5.0|This book I needed for a class. It came really quick and it was in great condition. Cant wait to read it to my students.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl: A Novel<br />The book was excellent, a real page turner, however, I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  I wanted Amy to be arrested and tried for her crimes. Although, Nick was flawed, I didn't  think he would stay with her in spite of the pregnancy. Ultimately, both characters are dysfunctional.  Very, very well-written.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I can't figure out if this is a biography, a comedy book, or a lesson in leadership. It's a good book with a little of all of these, but seems like it can't decide what it wants to be.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society:<br />Excellent book.  I never heard of this island before reading this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game a lot and it is fun to take care of a horse the horses are so realistic
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I kept hearing about this book but I thought no way. I read a few pages of it and it's totally bubbly!
B008N1LL42|5.0|Wonderful movie.. special effects  are great..  it was a bit preachy..  but at least the writer was an adult..  the lead actor was in the movie  Taylor Kitsch<br /><br />I personally think will grow into a great actor.. he is too beautiful  as a man  but as he gets older  he will have to be  better  as an actor..  but who cares now.. and Rihanna  I love her..  music..  give these people  a chance..<br /><br />Liam  always  think  you are great.. even the movie with Cher..  I am sorry about your loss.. from the first time I saw you  I thought that guy  has and will grow into a great actor..  You have

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this tale and the way it is interwoven with the photographs. The unresolved ending leaves room for a sequel, which may be annoying to the reader.

044042321X|5.0|It was very good!  I can't wait to start the second book!  It told the essential story and the graphic illustrations were very nice.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case fits my Amazon Kindle Fire perfectly. It was easy to install. The stand is a bit flimsy and difficult to keep in place but I won't be using that much so its not a big deal for me. For $15, you can't beat the value.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I'm no grandmaster at the game, but I enjoy a good game of chess in my free time.  Chess on the computer is nothing new, but this app is easy to use and does the important things right.  The movement animations are good, all of the standard sets of images for the pieces are there, the difficulty settings curve nicely, and it's easy to rage-quit and start a new game after you make a horrendously ill-considered move.  If you like Chess and want to play on the go, you could certainly do worse and probably pay more.  Would definitely recommend to a friend!
B0052GACNM|3.0|Didn't really like this Duets as well as the first one.  There are several duets that I really liked -- with k.d. Lang, Michael Buble, Josh Groban, and several others.  I really didn't care for the one with Aretha Franklin -- wrong song.  Sorry, but this one was done better in the first Duets with George Michael.  Shouldn't have tried to do it over.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|The Beatles are the best in history. And this is a great CD (CD's) that sample all of their best songs between the 60's and 70's, which I think is when they did their best.

1442337966|5.0|The Power has great teachings. It makes me not want to turn it off. It makes me feel great inside and out and all over. So easy to learn, The hardest thing at first though, was to stay positive when someone made me mad. I got over that by saying cancel. Awesome learning
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've tried a bunch of bingo apps and found this one to be the best by far. Fun and very addictive! Give it a try. Just wish the crowns were easier to get.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It was good and fun at first but about level 9, it froze up and when you tried to click anything it went to the final puzzle and nothing else then froze their.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love the graphics and colors.  The game gets progressively harder but not too much.  It is fun to buy things for your own personal fish tank.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really do enjoy this game when it actually lets me access it. Half the time when I if I on the app icon it loads about half way then kicks me off. Other than that it is an enjoyable game that helps pass the time.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|This IS NOT a film for everyone!<br />There are no nice people in the movie.<br />The move ends on a question.<br />The language, violence, sexuality and nudity while part of the story will upset many people.<br />However, the acting is excellent.<br />The characters are realistic and believable.<br />The story is tight, direct and very very good.<br />This move has no false notes and no leaps of faith.<br />Emile Hirsch shines as a two-bit hood with serious money problems.<br />Thomas Haden Church lives having almost no thoughts beyond his next beer.<br />Matthew McConaughey is all cold menace as the hired killer<br />Juno Temple is the social misfit love interest.<br />Gina Gershon is Thomas Haden Church wife.  She is playing a double, triple, or quadruple game.<br />Her movie entrance is a new level of sleaze.<br />If you like a good story, excellent acting and odd endings, you should love this movie.<br />I did.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the greatest game ever! Once I got it I could not even put down my Kindle. I would recommend this game for everyone
B005NFJAT4|5.0|I have owned this movie in about four different formats and both the standard and extended versions.  Yes, I am a Civil War person and while this is not good history, it is great entertainment to me.  They based this movie on The Killer Angles, one of the best Gettysburg novels.  The extras are experienced reenactors giving the movie an authentic look not found in most films.  The Producers made a serious attempt to make the actors look like the person they are playing, which is another nice touch.  All of this makes this the best looking, closest to history film on the battle.<br />The extended director's cut of 271 min adds over 20 minutes to the theatrical version.  Blu-ray extends the experience with a much sharper picture.  With this low price, it is worth upgrading to the best available system.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book that is in an even better series! It is well worth the money! Awesome series.

B007L6VR12|5.0|&#34;Moonrise Kingdom&#34; (2012) is a truly unique comedy-drama that will grow in stature. Director Wes Anderson creates his own cinematic landscape with an offbeat ensemble, brilliant color scheme and eclectic soundtrack. Inexplicably, this quirky masterpiece earned a single Academy Award nomination (Best Original Screenplay). The film deserved more honors than it received.
1609611543|1.0|I started on the Wheat Belly plan after reading the book and the cook book. I cut out wheat, starches, added in more nuts, cheese, eggs. I continued to swim daily and walk.<br /><br />I noticed a blip on my Fitbit website, which tracks my activity and weight. I noticed that although I was dropping weight at a good rate (about a pound a day, 5 lbs overall), it was listing it as lean mass loss. I thought it was an inaccuracy.<br /><br />Let me back up and say that I have been losing weight since April, tracking my calories and such on MFP and Fitbit. I have an Aria scale, which measures body mass (lean v. fat) and weight. All along I have been losing weight on a weekly basis, a couple of pounds. With each weigh in I have seen that my fat has decreased and I have been excited to see my lean mass increase slowly over the months. I have lost 30 lbs.<br /><br />The past five days, while following Wheat Belly, I have lost five pounds, but my scale lists it as lean mass gone and my fat mass has stayed the same. To me that means I am burning muscle. I have gone from 134 pounds of lean mass to 129 and my fat ratio has stayed where it was when I started Wheat Belly.<br /><br />I am going back to eating my balanced meals and not cutting the carbs back to the level required by the book.<br /><br />By the way, in this book the doctor says that you cut out wheat. To cut to the chase, you cut out wheat, corn, potatoes, rice, most dairy (except high fat dairy such as cheese, cream cheese, sour cream), sugar, anything processed. To say this is not highly restrictive is a lie. It's Atkins with a new wrapper.<br /><br />Time for a turkey sandwich. With bread.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Viewing the very first season of Star Trek free with my amazon prime membership. Watching through the streaming capabilities of my Sony Blu Ray on my Sony 50 inch LCD (original model) and the episodes look sharp and clear. (not bad for free!) Nice to see them in original broadcast order with original special effects.
B0094MFITS|5.0|There is a balance in this series between good and evil in each role, making the characters seem somewhat more real--at least more recognizably human than most characters in television/movie series.  I find the music evocative and the scenes touching.  I have all eight episodes in this series, and sincerely hope there are more episodes to follow....
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is one of my few \\"must have\\" apps. Clear information - the graphics really help. The layout is excellent. It's easy to find what's relevant to you. Excellent!
B00330UFQS|5.0|This is one of the best groups to come along in any genre for a very long time. The smooth harmonies are enthralling, and Hillary Scott's voice is near angelic.. The group is classified as country, but the music is right at home in pop or rock and roll. If anyone thinks that shows like American Idol showcase America's real talent, keep in mind that Hillary Scott was rejected twice. This is a must have for all.
B005VPRET4|4.0|Is a very nice lego. Only that is too small. I think that may be more big. However, is a great toy.
0385737955|5.0|This book is definitely worth it. I read the hunger games before I found these and thought it was going to be the same story. I was wrong I am very happy I read this book! I am so wrapped into the story I had to buy all of the books!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The book is supposed to be the third in a trilogy but the author has now decided that she wants a 5 book series instead. This means that she needed a lot of filler because she had nowhere for the story line to go. She devotes several chapters to re-hashing the events in the first two books and spends a lot of time attempting to build up the secondary characters. Unfortunately, her attempts are boring and predicable. So predicable that I was beginning to think I was reading a script for a Soap Opera rather than a romance novel. And just like a Soap Opera the book ends in the middle of a pivotal plot point. Want to know the end of the story? Then you'll have to wait for books 4 and 5 of the trilogy to be published.<br /><br />The book is also very, very short. Maybe it's because I just skimmed the parts of the book that I had already read in the first 2 books but it only took a few hours to read the whole thing. I returned the book because I refuse to support an author who chooses to drag out a story and/or not finish a book because she can't/won't finish writing the book before it's published.
0385742886|4.0|I love the book the story was great I read all of it in one day I just couldn't put it down and I am a fast reader. I was a little confused at the end. Without giving a spoiler all I will say is that I have read online that if you bought the book at Barnes and Noble it has and extra chapter in the epilogue that explained what I wanted to know. With that said I haven't read the extra chapter I only know what I wanted to know from online fan chats. Still a great book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is awesome you will love it if you get it you'll love it. I hope you like it:)
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|My one and one half year old chooses this first when selecting a film to watch with breakfast.  His father likes it to!
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I tried downloading this three times and it would never load or open properly.  It looks like very good graphics but it must use a ton of memory.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love everything about this- the art, the story, EVERYTHING! Now if I could just get past the Odd Calm level... ;D
B009RH9J7W|3.0|This case is good but has a big design flaw.  Advantages is that it protects the Kindle Fire HD very well, it's not too bulky, it swivels (but only so far as to put the screen in portrait mode while using the positioning slots in the case to stand it up while looking at the screen in the hands free position).  I use the feature for standing the kindle screen (while in landscape) in different &#34;tilt&#34; positions the MOST and it's very convenient.<br /><br />The one MAIN disadvantage of this case is that when you need to recharge your Kindle, the port for the charging cable is situated so that you cannot close the case the way you normally would to protect your Kindle.  Instead you have to &#34;flip&#34; the case over into the position you would have it in if you were going to read a book on your Kindle while holding the case.  So you cannot cover the SCREEN of the Kindle in this position with the &#34;flap&#34; of the case.<br /><br />The reason that you are unable to close the Kindle properly while the charging cable is inserted into the Kindle, is that the &#34;swivel&#34; does not allow you to swivel the Kindle all the way around so that the charging &#34;port&#34; is facing outward while the case is in the closed position.  This is a MAJOR design flaw for this case and is of no fault to the Kindle design, but rather to the Marware company for not trying out the Kindle while the charging cable is plugged into the charging port.  If they had tried it out I'm sure they would have made the case be able to swivel the Kindle so that the port is facing outward so the cable could be plugged into the Kindle while the case was closed.<br /><br />If Marware ever does decide to FIX there design by allowing the swivel component to swivel all the way around so that the charging port is on the &#34;outside&#34;, they should do a voluntary &#34;recall&#34; on the old design and swap it for the old version for free!  Swapping it would keep customers LOYAL to their brand. This is a very disappointing flaw of this case!<br /><br />If the swivel feature were done correctly, I would have given it 5 stars, but I can't stand this design flaw.  I didn't know about it until I actually tried to charge my Kindle.  Check out the other cases to see if they have this design flaw also.  Then decide if you want this case or a different brand.  I've been using this case
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its fun to find this style game out there.  Reminds me of the games we use to play as kids. Nice to exercise your mind and memory a bit. Would love more levels!!!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case is everything I wanted. It is durable, lightweight and looks great. It does a wonderful job of protecting my Kindle and positions the kindle perfectly for reading hands free.
1451695195|2.0|Lost interest quickly, it told more about her life as a struggling person than her experience for which she named the book after. Not worth reading in my opinion
B0062QRTKA|3.0|It worked on the Test Drive and never again. I reinstalled twice and I'm disappointed. I really enjoyed playing it while it worked... too good to true
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting, innovative, and intriguing!!! You enjoy the fun routes leading to...hmmm don't know yet. I'm going to find out though!!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I hate this app. hard to use, freezes. I just.don't like don't waste your time not worth it. don't get the app
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love Drew Evans! He is so funny and blunt! This book is definitely one to re-read a few times!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|the journey game is very intreguing and very mysterious with no blatant way to go you are just simply drawn in one direction toward stuff with no real reason why,flower game is awsome just tilt controller and push any buttoin on controller to give a burst of continuous wind (wind stops when button is let go)and idea of this game is to touch each of the petals in the levels to create a long flowing stream of petals and it is simply relaxing, the third game flow just simply is about tilting the controller to get the single celled organism to eat stuff and grow larger and make it up to other levels and then at some point in game you switch to another creatcher this is what you get with game the 3 main games plus 3 classic arcade style games and 2 or 3  dynamic themes to download are included and some art and all three full cd length themes from each of the 3 main games are included to download (once only).very good buy in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too easy, not too hard.  Keeps you interested enough to keep going to the next room. Doesn't frustrate you into quitting.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|This book puts faces to women and families who have been dealing with a culture of sexism, religious oppression, and a wartime environment in Afghanistan. I read it as part of my all-female book club and we were all equally disturbed and touched by the gripping story.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Cool game but it annoys me when you have to get a lot of Iso8 to revive and continue and you have to get a lot of experience points to buy armour but it is a cool game.
B00000IREA|3.0|It's ok for a Jane Fonda movie. Not really any story. I bought after hearing a bunch of stuff about it. Borrow it if you can...but don't buy it.
140053271X|5.0|it caused my child to be more involved in reading and has now become a great reader thanks it was just what the doctor ordered
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I loved it when I seen it at the movies and glad to have it in my movie collection.
B000FCK65W|3.0|This was a decent read. It was slow to start, and not a heck of a lot happens throughout the book, however the characters were believable, and I fell in love with and seeing them go through even the day to day kinds of hurdles of life.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The final Sookie Stackhouse novel has gotten a lot of grief for the ending, but could there really have been an ending that satisfied both True Blood and the book fans? Each set has a choice for Sookie's soul mate. Harris wrote this novel in the same way she wrote the others. If you enjoyed the other books, this will satisfy you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it easy to use and can play for many hours there are also no glitches found yet hardly any random ads popping up
0399255370|5.0|I read this book to my 5-year-old daughter and when we got to the end she asked me to read it again.  When I got to the end of the second reading she announced she had an idea about drawing \\"live crayons like in the book\\" and embarked on a project of drawing different color crayons with colored wardrobes to match and made a \\"dress the crayons\\" game out of it.  She loves to have books read to her, but this is one of the only times my short-attention-span kid has asked for the same book twice in a row and the first time a book as inspired such a burst of creativity.<br /><br />This book would be great for all sorts of ages: from very little kids who will like the idea of the talking crayons and the cute illustrations, to much older kids who will find the crayon's witty banter and creative complaints extremely funny.<br /><br />This is going to be my new gift for everything from baby showers to birthdays to Christmas!  Don't hesitate to order this one, your kids will want to hear it over and over.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather is pretty unpredictable where I live, so it's good to have this on my Kindle when I'm out and about.  Also, with the Kindle, I don't have to turn on the TV and wait for &#34;weather on the 8's&#34; or log onto the computer.  I just grab my Kindle and get what I need to know almost instantaneously.  I recommend this app.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This alarm clock is great. I can see the temperature and wind speed . Another great aspect is that I can set up multiple alarms at one time
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Since my Kindle is much easier to take along than a laptop, this app is perfect when I'm on the road.  The app works great!
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|To be honest, this is not a bad album.  I like the previous album \\"From under the cork tree\\" as well. Probably one of my faves. This album however, has a different feel to it. It's rather catchy, but you can still tell that it's Fall Out Boy.  It's actually something that I would listen to whenever I get the chance.<br />I like the tone and love his voice when he sings.  You be your own judge of the album.  Everyone's feel on it is totally different.<br />I also like how they are singing with Elton John, Big Sean, Courtney Love..adds a different feel to it all and makes it more unique.<br />Some of my favorite songs from the album- \\"Where did the party go\\", \\"Miss Missing you\\", \\"Young Volcanoes\\" are just a few to list.<br />It's catchy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you enjoyed the &#34;50 Shades&#34; series than this is a series you will also enjoy.  I have read the whole series and enjoyed Sylvia Day's writing style and am hoping there will be another in the series!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best games ever because it tracks you about the  way horse need to be taken great  care of one day your own horse
B000SZH8LQ|5.0|This is a singer that can make you laugh, cry, think, or just &#34;be&#34;.  I just love her voice.  I totally recommend this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the challenge of this game. It was mind boggling but lots of fun. I had a hard time getting through level 10 but I finally got it. I can't wait until new rooms are available.
B005K01VZS|5.0|A truly great work. Great depth of the individuals brings these individuals to life. A moving experience for everyone. A must read for those looking for a little faith.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Plenty of action, great characters and story. Plenty of twists and turns!!!<br />Can't wait to view the third season to view.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|a good detailed account of the mission. a little too much personal history of a individual Seal. A good explanation of the personal sacrifices and work ethic of the Seals.
B00B5L899C|5.0|Life of Pi is a New York Times best seller and a major motion picture. This book differs from every novel I've ever read. I decided to read it when I discovered that the pastor at my son's church planned to do a message on it. Also, early in the book the claim is made that this story will make you believe in God.<br /><br />The story centers on a boy by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel - Pi for short - and is told from his viewpoint. His father owns a zoo to the delight of Pi and his brother, Ravi. The information and insight into zoo animals is stunning.<br /><br />Due to political changes in India, Pi's father sells the zoo and the family embarks on a cargo ship to Canada and a new life. The ship sinks and the only survivors are Pi and few of their animals - together in a life boat drifting on the Pacific Ocean for about 190 pages! The story is riveting, clever, humorous, detailed, and intense.<br /><br />There are spiritual themes - it could be thought of as a parable of life. Pi explains convincingly that animals in the wild are not happy because they're free. (Are we?) Life is an adventure and brings both crisis and delight in unexpected ways. We're adrift and hoping to be rescued. Whether redemptive or not Life of Pi is a great story. I will not see the movie as it would get my adrenalin going way too much.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|NOW WE NEED ANOTHER BOOK TO FINISH THE STORY.  I AM WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE... HOPE SHE WRITES FAST
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Ok third book but the other two were better. It ended with a definite fourth book to come but was very boring with them recon firming their love every other line. I love you no I love you, no I love  you more, no I love you more!!!! Barely anything of substance was said or happened in this book.
1400069289|4.0|I thought this book was going to be about our habits why we do them etc... It was more about just habit and he goes and gives examples on some of them. Still very much an interesting read and interesting topic though.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|The music and dancing were great, as one would expect, but the quality of the video was really lacking. At times it was very badly pixelated. I would expect something of MUCH higher production quality. It did seem to get better as we got deeper into the performance, but really, it's digital and should be crisp from start to finish. At one point I thought maybe it was a VHS dub.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I disliked the book, to many slow moving parts and to much technical legal parts. The  Jacob person was not fleshed out enough and rather dull
1250012570|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. I took it with me on a trip to read on the plane. I didn't even end up reading it until I got to my aunts house in Nicaragua. Eventually when I got bored I picked up this book and started reading. After that I couldn't put it down! I finished it in 3 days. It was beautifully written and I laughed. Two thumbs up.
B00030DEQE|4.0|There are a couple other variations of this card from intel with more advanced features so make sure you know what you need before ordering.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|I got this for my best friend for her birthday. She had a hard time finding this CD and was happy when I gave it to her! She says it's an amazing track.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I use autocad inventor and after using this 3d knob I don't ever want to go back to using just a mouse. It's a solid heavy product that's fully customizable and runs perfect in a windows environment. It also works well with mac but not so well in a virtual machine like parallels. Designing with this has made it fun and intuitive. Being able to move your model around while working is truly something to be experienced. I would pay double for this if I had too.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Just finished the book and now watching the first season - so far, so good - interesting story line - the only issue is having to buy it!  Will look at my Netflix subscription after this series  for Season Two.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|It points up so you can get even lighting at party's and other indoor events and provides a strong daytime flash without the bulk of a larger model.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game I reccommend for any one. I would say 95% out of a 100 like this game.<br />love it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Awesome game.Accidentally removed it from the device. Kindle fire hd...now I have to start all over again. This sux I was on level 43 or 44. This is crazy.should b a way to recoup all your progress.
B006X96PF6|2.0|I think all the songs sounded similar and did not realize it was a live performance.  I find the quality of such recordings sub-par and distracting form the overall experience.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is the best I've ever played. I even play it over and over again! It keeps me entertained when friends can't come over, and I can't wait for more levels!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I though this was the last one, boy was I wrong... Excellent series oh books. Can't wait for the next one.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Am having trouble playing the game because it says I need to connect to internet which I haven't needed  to do before. We don't have internet at our house so very big disappointment. What happened?<br /> Would  love to give 5 stars because I love the game. Please fix the connect to internet problem.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|its like a 40's go gett'um writting with all the newer effects you know 90's style . but they work and very well this movie<br />is about a war between humans and big bugs . but its also about people and the diference between a citizen and a civilian.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|game makes you think but can get annoying with all the bouncing from screen to screen. other than that pretty good.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon customer service rocks!  When I called because my Kindle was not charging they sent me a new charger free of charge.  No hassling, no questions, just &#34;let us send you this updated charger and see if that helps&#34;!  I was surprised to say the least....it has been a long time since I dealt with a company that cared about my needs.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|this movie was awesome soooo glad i decided to buy it and i cant wait for the 2nd installment to this movie i will be buying that to
B00005YXZH|4.0|I just recently got into Wilco and decided to buy Yankee Hotle Foxtrot after seeing them on the Hurricane Festival on Palladia.  From beginning to end this album is really enjoyable mixing in all sorts of musical elements different sounds and great tracks.  This album doesnt really have a bad song on it and is definately a good introduction to this band and explains why this album was so big when it came out.  Heavy Metal Drummer is my favorite song cause it has such a great flow to it, a nice hook and implements different keyboard effects throughout.  War on War and The Man That Loves You are also very worth mentioning but the whole album hooks you and makes you want to hear more from this band.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This Game Is Amazing , Over The Top I Like It Better Then 100 Floors and 100 Exits . It's Fun & Exiting , Keeps Your Mind Busy & Active

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this puzzle is challengeing. it gets harder as you progress. makes you think. Love it!! I wish more puzzles like this were available /
B00D3V85FA|5.0|If your looking for Old Sabbath well this is actually it.This Album plays like a beautiful homage almost to all things sabbath all the time.\\"Zeitgeist\\" (is a cloud ride into that beautiful BS bliss)\\" \\"Damaged Soul\\" ( is what year is this nostalgia) and \\"Live Forever\\" is easily why your a sabbath fan in the first place,One of there most provoking songs Ever.All in All if you even have any love of music let alone Metal or just Progressive Rock this album will refresh your engines and make you appreciate just how special Black Sabbath was in the first place. This Album is a Classic, and the best comeback album being so true to the original sound. 9.7 i give it.The Metal Happy Camper Album..Beautiful Stuff to hear in these times of drought and wasted spotlight.
B00BFPX132|5.0|I've been a Sodomaniac since I picked up their \\"Obsessed by Cruelty\\" way back when on vinyl.  At the time I had never heard of them, but lots of purchases back then were successful based on the cover art (and sometimes the record label).  And this new one is another GREAT addition to the Sodom library of metal.<br /><br />Let's break this cd down...<br />songwriting<br /> 4.5/5 - superbly crafted music! Very catchy and still extreme. I can't get \\"Final Bullet\\" out of my head.<br /><br />production and mix<br /> 4/5 - I do have issues with all metal cds in the past 3-4 years - audio compression. When Ian Gillan said \\"make everything louder than everything else\\" way back when, he didn't mean to clip all the presence out of a song!<br /><br />musicianship<br /> 5/5 - Spectacular!<br /><br />vocals<br /> 4.5/5 - Awesome Angelripper vocals as always. He actually changes it up a bit (more gruff) on \\"Stigmatized\\". Angelripper is an awesome vocalist for this type of music, and he doesn't just scream his way through a track. One thing... the title track. It should be pronounced \\"ee-pit-uh-mee\\" but it's mispronounced. I know Sodom is from Germany, but why does Angelripper pronounce it \\"ep-ee-tomb\\"? That does make me cringe when I hear that otherwise awesome song.<br /><br />lyrics and themes<br /> 3.5/5 - usually I don't care about this. I'm ambivalent unless something knocks my socks off. This is fine.<br /><br />Now... how about some other relevant factors outside of the music itself?<br /><br />honesty/integrity of this cd<br /> 5/5 - A bonafide extreme metal cd that doesn't have any \\"fake\\" aggression whatsoever!<br /><br />packaging/presentation<br /> 4/5 - I don't really get the artwork - it looks like they changed their mind halfway through and added a bunch of filler (look at the inner sleeve to see the uncluttered version). Also... if I pay for the \\"deluxe version\\", then I want all the bonus tracks!  (And the bonus tracks are good!!)  So why is the Motorhead cover only on the vinyl? This kind of thing is why people are tempted to look for torrents...)<br /><br />band goodwill (ie: any positive aura for this cd)<br /> 5/5 - Sodom are legends - enough said!<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT - one of the best extreme thrash metal cds released this year!
B008133MDK|5.0|The second season of Sherlock outdid the first. This season I felt like we were able to see a different side of Sherlock.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The friendship of two children and then later two teenagers hit home for me.  Chris`s love and sexual desire for Em don't seem so unusual until one  thinks about her need to be the perfectionist.  She has dreams of becoming someone else after high school but the connection to Chris will never, no matter what happens, allow her to change.  That feeling of desperation leads her to the only other  option.  The choice she makes, selfishly no doubt, is proof that her other  half will forever be intertwined with her love and consequently her decisions.
0399215921|1.0|I didn't realize just how little this book was.  Could hardly read it.  Went out and bought the bigger version and basically wasted the money because it wasn't worth the additional cost to return.  Make sure you read the dimensions of the book when you purchase.  Board books are now about 2 x 3 apparently.
B00140PK6O|5.0|For all of us who thoroughly enjoy BBC/Masterpiece Theatre British period programs, this one (and its sequel - &#34;Return to Cranford&#34;) is totally satisfying, and will remain among my favorites.  I received an excellent value from Amazon.com, it was extremely well packaged and arrived several days ahead of schedule.  For those who enjoy Judi Dench's acting, you'll want to add this to your collection.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Sisters Tess and Bee have known tragedy in their lives and now live an ocean apart to cope: each in her own way, but when one sister goes missing, the other drops her carefully constructed life to search for answers.  Reality clashes with nightmarish cruelty in a story that embraces both the ethical questions raised by genetic engineering and the enduring questions of how any of us can truly know much less love self or others,  This book made me examine many preconceived notions about scientific progress, family, loss, and the human capacity to find salvation in the most hopeless situations.<br /><br />Rosamund Lupton has perfectly crafted a novel that will make you want to read it in one sitting if you have the time. Her prose is flawless so that you can easily identify with and enter into the world of her flawed but wonderfully interesting characters.  Not usually a fan of murder mysteries, but this one rises above the genre because of the beauty of the prose and the complexity of the characters and situations. I will be looking for more novels of this caliber by Lupton in the future.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Update: I have owned this mouse for almost 2 years now and I absolutely love it. It has held up well under daily usage. Nothing coming off, chipped or faded all of the lights still work.  Upon reflection, the thing that I like best about this mouse is the fact that I barely have to move my hand at all to move the pointer. That is not surprising at 8000dpi, but I like it so much that I wanted to update my earlier review. I would recommend this mouse to anyone.   1. Outstanding price for an 8000dpi gaming mouse. 2. 9 programmable buttons 3. Recordable macros 4. Neat looking pulsing light with adjustable colors. 5. Requires a claw grip - Don't buy if you's rather palm 6. Big, great for people with big hands
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and gets you thinking. Great way to kill time. I recommended it if you are bored.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not at all what I expected when I decided to read this book. But it was A  very I interesting read.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Loved the way this book was written. Captivating anecdotes with incredibly well-researched facts and history of the processed food industry. Can tell this author is a seasoned reporter/journalist and not a demagogue, as he does not seek to demonize the fast/processed food industry, but rather lays out the facts and ends on a very self-empowering note. Would highly recommend for anyone interested in nutrition, evolution of processed foods in the US, marketing/advertising, etc.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is entertaining. The graphics are well done. I hope to find other games made by this company. I am interested to see more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! if u like horses and taking care of them then this is the app for you!!!!!!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Loved this movie. Its a classic and all time favorite Childhood movie. It made me laugh it made me smile. Great family movie and teaches you about life. I recommed it for a family movie.
B008846CAC|4.0|Great for initial getting used to GMAT questions.you get to read the questions from laptop or iPad so u will already get the feel of the exam.going to different sections is not that convenient though.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I like fairy tales gone wild. I like the actors and actresses and everyone performed as I thought they would. The movie production was great.  My kind of movie.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|it is really fun. the downloading was long but that is my only worry. but it is really fun to play and do.
0062255657|5.0|I was so gripped by this book I couldn't set it down, not even one time when I picked it up to start reading. Haunting, utterly unique, terrible and beautiful...I can't recommend this book enough. It tickles my brain in the same magical manner Ray Bradbury does~ A real stunner, no doubt.
B000S1M9LY|3.0|I didn't finish it. Anyone saying they did is a liar. They probably read Finnegan's Wake for the jokes too. This book is dense and wanders very close to the edge of shedding enlightenment on the reader. Problem for me is I hate tennis.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was good but not as much drama as the first two. I hated the ending. I know there will be another book but....
B003O86FMW|5.0|so good that i died with every word.  so violent, romantic, addictive. you will love it. you should read catching fire.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is a fun game where you get to use different characters (ninjas, super monkeys, cannons, ect.)to help you pop balloons.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The best Album from him since Heroes. Every song captivates and entertains. Another classic for this generation. Bowie fan? This is a must have!
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Let save you some time slogging through long reviews.  Here are the tracks not to be missed:<br /><br />\\"Pusher Love Girl\\" - Fun r&b beat, a head-bopper for your car<br />\\"Suit & Tie\\" - Great track... but first single, so you've already heard and downloaded this one<br />\\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" - Perfection.  Smooth intro followed by an old school groovy ode to the girl around the way and jazzy outro. To the reviewer who thought this track was too long and wanted to cut it down-yes, its long, but that's not always a bad thing.  This is the kind of song you can put on your summer chill mix.<br />\\"Mirrors\\" - This is the other single from this album. Pretty good, but currently on heavy radio rotation and the pop edge is not my favorite<br /><br />Other songs are just okay, although there are some that feel like they can grow on you with time.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I thought it was well written.  The story was well paced. The characters were well developed.  The book was hard to put down.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Having not read any of the Frank Baum originals I can't speak to accuracy of the story or anything like that... but like most of the world, I've seen the Wizard of Oz before and this was a fair prequel.<br /><br />The FX were cool but sometimes (honestly) looked kinda cheesy.  I half wonder if this was purposeful considering what it is (and considering the original movie was a musical).<br /><br />In the end, the movie was enjoyable.  There were a few parts that had my 5 and 8 year olds jumping out of their seats and the ending was straight up fist pumping, hell yeah, exciting.<br /><br />I hope they continue adapting the story in the series in this new format.  I'd definitely throw good money at more of these.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am always late to the party but I do eventually get there.  The same with The Hunger Games.  I kept saying \\"no, not interested\\".  Guess what? When I finally bought the book I couldn't put it down and then the same with the other two of the series.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I am only half way through this book and so far it's good, but a little technical for me. It's good, but I am not riveted by it like I thought I'd be.
B003Y5D776|5.0|Quick, great price and exactly as described. Plug it into audio output switch to line out connect and better sound than laptop or MAC has built in. Also have mic capability and you can cue off device or laptop or Mac. I suggest set master audio to iMic and cue to built in audio for best results. Good luck<br />DJJakeJ
6302158095|4.0|Various reviews indicated that the VHS version was the only choice for a good restoration of a neglected 1940 movie.  My VHS/CD player played it nicely, and it is well (but not perfectly) restored.  Deems Taylor, Stokowski, and no other later additions.  Better an OK original than a modified version using actors who were children or not even born in 1940.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Everything is good about Subway Surfers except for the updating. It is ridiculous on how long it takes to update. Sometimes you even have to delete it and then download it again!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Well written and researched, this sci fi novel is very detailed in its depiction of a make believe future zombie war.  Too gross and too much gratuitous bad language, guts and gore for me though. It does make you think, with historical and political analogies that are frightening if not self-reflective.  GI Joe meets War of the Worlds meets Dawn of the Dead. If you like zombies and war stories or stories from all points on the globe and many different cultures trying to deal with the same threat you will like it.  I just am not in that camp.
B008U85TV4|5.0|Always picks you up. Some of the most uplifting and inspiring music since Queen.<br /><br />Party anthems for the ages. Yeah!
0756407125|5.0|This book, no this series, is phenomenal. If you are a fantasy lover and some one who wants a new twist on magic, a new world rich with history and intrigue, characters that will bring out a plethora of emotions, then Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller Chronicles are what you've been searching for. I could go on and write pages upon pages about how great these books are, but you need to experience it yourself. Bottom line is Patrick Rothfuss has created literary gold in this series and these books will outlast us all. Much like Tolkein and C.S. Lewis have their generation. Bottom line: Get it; Read it!
1609611543|2.0|There was to much material that repeated itself and not enough recipes.<br />I found it difficult to follow. Some recipes I didj like but on the whole found the book to confussing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved how all the little different stories were woven together.  It showed that we live in a small world.
0525478817|5.0|I just don't know what to say if it doesnt change your life. This book is absolutly amazing, wonderful, sad, heartbreaking, funny - all at the same time. Read it. You won't regret it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I've got both versions on 2 seperate phones but same make and model (Samsung Galaxy S3) and the current up to date software for this program tanked it. It doesn't work. However my other phone which is not enabled for auto updates works with no issues at all.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Laugh out Loud Funny and truly worth watching again! Love Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper even more and Robert DeNiro is never a disappointment!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Its an okay game. its basic too. just look for things and it has a story to it, but there is not a lot of mystery to it.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I bought this game for my kindle fire.  It was slow and to me a waste of time.  It  is totally my fault since I did not read the details of the game.  If you are looking for a match 3 game I highly recommend all of the Jewel Quest games.  Most of them at least have a story behind them.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|For what I believe is the 6th attempt to put F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby on the screen, director Baz Luhrmann's adaption brings the novel to life in a novel way. Many will love the razz pizzazz of Baz-Jazz and hate the 1920's soap opera-like scenes. Others will appreciate the reverent tone of Fitzgerald's novel, especially the words narrated by the writer's surrogate, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and hate the loud, gaudy yet contemporary party scenes. For me the film is balanced pretty well.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.<br /><br />After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.<br /><br />In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his \\"Moulin Rouge\\" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. \\"Gatsby\\" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.<br /><br />The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2 ½ hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.<br /><br />The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. In a word it looks spectacular. This transfer is an honest projection of the filmmaker's intent. The film is often very bright, especially when there is a party going on. The colors are intense and the picture is crisp. Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is rich with the mixture of genres in the musical score. The surrounds are often in play, especially during the party sequences. Subtitles come in Spanish, Portuguese, French and English SDH. I did not review the 3-D version.  Here is a list of extras:<br />*The Greatness of Gatsby: Pre-production<br />*\\"Within and Without\\" with Tobey Maguire: Featurette<br />*The Swinging Sounds of Gatsby: Jay-Z, Beyonce, Fergie, will.i.am, Lana del Rey, Bryan Ferry, Florence + the Machine, Andre 3000, The XX, Sia, Gotye<br />*Gatsby Revealed: 5 key sequences<br />*The Jazz Age: The roaring '20's<br />*Razzle Dazzle: Costumes based on the era<br />*Fitzgerald's Visual Poetry<br />*Deleted Scenes<br />*1926 Trailer - The Great Gatsbyhip-hop.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Love this app! The only thing I would like to see is more of a selection and less repetitions. But all in all, great app!
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever, Keira is amazing, Macfadyen brings an interesting side to Mr. Darcy, and without this movie my love for Jane Austin would have never started.
B00CXG5E6E|3.0|George Benson Inspiration ( A Tribute To Nat King Cole ) I guess I'll buy most anything with George Benson's name on it , in this case I bought it because of both names George and Nat's, I really liked it and was somewhat impressed by the similarities of George and Nat's voices, the arrangements were cool and excellent listening I've heard George do somewhat better yet like I said it's good listening , pick it up if you like good vocal Jazz.
B003DT19F0|5.0|When the mail person or ups brings us something and as I mentioned<br />yesterday to him...He brings Christmas to us all year long !<br /><br />Excellent movie here, I highly recommend it for 'all' ages !
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Since this was the 3rd novel, I thought it would be more final.  I wanted an ending.  Loved reading it but #2 by far was the best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|addicting from the first level to the last and its original and you won't. find a game like it anywhere else
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Such a great book. I couldn't stop reading it. It kept me guessing! And it had quite a bit of comedy in it
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the combined suspense, humor and romance all in one show.  Great stories and believable characters.This is my favorite show!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this app!  Couldn't quit until I made it through all the rooms in one evening.  This game was so addicting.  can't wait until more rooms are available!
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|This is great. I'm 11 and i think this is cool because you can have a science notebook in it, a DIARY, your passwords....etc. I just wish it came with a password.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved. Could not put it down. Had to read them all over gain. I want to know what happens next.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Look don't get me wrong i love Sylvia Day books she is a great writer but after all that waiting I found the book to be a let down.<br />I will still read the next two books but I don't think that number 3 was up there with book 1 and 2<br /><br />It is a great story but something was just missing for me in entwined lets hope that captivated by you does just that and captivate me once again
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Typical Dan Brown, interesting and entertaining. I like his explanations of all of the symbols and the meanings of older things I know about.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved this book by Sylvia Day the story line between Gideon and Eve is fantastic I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it great writing
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Kept me interested the whole time.  I can not wait for the next one to come out. Please Hurry!  Hurry!
B005GSY23M|5.0|I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, tho I did appreciate seeing something different and applaud the filmakers for that, however the soundtrack definitely helped keep my interest throughout.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to soundtrack fans of movies along the lines of \\"Tron\\" or \\"Dredd\\" (the new one, NOT the Stallone film) as it is mostly techno type music similar to those films.
1589946006|5.0|Useful for dnd and other rpg's. nice detail and two sizes for room décor and temples. Great price too. I would buy other items from this seller.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|One of my favorite movies from when I was a kid, and still a great movie today.  Truly a must for anyone who aim's to teach their children about the wonder of belief.
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|I purchased this item hoping to eliminate some of the glare that occasionally comes off the water. The first filter arrived scratched, but was immediately replaced by the seller. (Kudos!) I attached the next to my camera and used the camera as I would normally. I examined the filter after a few hours of video-ing and wiping the lense, and found that it was all scratched and had swirl marks. I cleaned it as I normally would and was not &#34;Rough&#34; with it... but the results were as stated. I would NOT recommend this product as the plastic lense material (filter) is way too soft and mars easily.
B002XTBEDI|1.0|I was very upset to find that this was only the sequel and not the first season as well.  Perhaps I didn't read the product info clearly, but the way it is PRESENTED gives the impression it is CRANFORD AND RETIRN TO CRANFORD.... Now I will have to pay double to get season one instead of the SET.  It should NOT be labeled CRANFORD  in big letters and then Return to Cranford, giving the impression it is BOTH.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is toats amazing. The first time I played it I was addicted to it. You get to get a lot of characters and boards.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|If you are like me and love the psy/changeling world that Singh has created you have been waiting a long time for this book and in my opinion Singh delivered an outstanding story that revealed another complex and heartrending love story that I simply could not put down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The wonderful 50 shades continues.... this story has a bit of everything for you to enjoy.  So grab you drink and sit in a comfortable chair because you won't want o get up.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Unlike other books that have story lines this one really really lacks.  Should have finished the series here and not in another 2 books, won't be rushing to buy the next ones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very Sexy- this is great seducing love story that will draw you in and before you know it, it has a hold on you.  At that point your not going to want to put this book down.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I enjoy learning about both the positive and negative experiences of a successful person and how they have learned from them. Mark Cuban is quite open and full of lessons in this book.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I w S disappointed with the book,too much info on animals and zoos not as good a story as I thought it would be.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|What a disgusting human being Kathryn Bigelow must be.  Zero Dark Thirty claims it is based on real events.  What this propagandist does not tell you is the fact that the movie is based on real events that the government wants you to believe.<br /><br />Now the cat is out of the bag.  The fact is that the scriptwriter of the film, Mark Boal, admits the CIA vetted the script for his film.  In fact, he would be in constant contact with the CIA to see how he should write an event, if they liked it, or to remove parts from the script they deemed unfavorable.<br /><br />So, basically, the CIA helped produce a propaganda piece that show torturers as heroes.  I guess they need cover from future prosecution.  The fact is torture never helped in locating Osama Bin Laden.  However, if you watch the film, it shows torture as one of the leading tools in aiding in the capture of bin Laden.  I wonder why that is.<br /><br />How saddening is it that Bigelow and Boal have allowed themselves to be used in such a horrific way?  Then again, if you are collecting the Benjamins, does it make it easier to engage in such an activity.  More importantly, what does it say about Hollywood and our mainstream media outlets?  If we can't trust the fact that the information is independent of government influence, should we even watch it?<br /><br />I guess their next film will be about how the NSA's spying program of all Americans is a necessary and legal thing to do.  They will probably think they are heroes too.
0783240287|5.0|My daughter loves to sing.  She loves to sing along with the show.  I do try to fast forward Potiphers wife as often as I can.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|I loved this recording- not because of the 1960 Las Vegas setting but because of the beauty of the three main voices. Rigoletto, the Duke and Gilda were really outstanding. I will try to buy more recordings from these artists.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! I really enjoy this game! So excited to begin more levels. This is a great game for both children and adults.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put it down. I really enjoyed reading this book. Unpredictable. A good beach or pool side read.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I do not typically read fantasy. At first, I could not understand what all the fuss was about, and I thought Martin's style was a bit impenetrable. But I stuck with it, and before I knew it, I was drinking up every word. I was actually surprised when I turned the last page- I had been so caught up in the story hat I hadn't noticed. I would definitely recommend!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I got this product as a free trial. Good thing it was free as it never ran properly. Phone was a Motorola Razor.
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|Enjoyable, but the lesser of the three. Found it a bit drawn out in the middle and with to many characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just started playing and for two days straight, I couldn't stop. I just love this game. You'll especially love it if you like horses.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|My son loved this movie.  He especially likes &#34;Buck&#34;.  He says that it is the best character in the Ice Age series.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|this is amazing. I love it !! great job and kudos to the creator :)  everyone with children should have this - very useful.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I thought it'd be fun for me but, since the &#34;free&#34; options are so limited you don't get to do much. I uninstalled it soon after first playing it.
B00008973A|5.0|Great movie with a great cast of actors and actresses.  Michael Douglas is fabulous in this movie.  Just a great movie all around.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game...I like the new levels and the \\"save me\\" option...I find it easier and more entertaining to play than the original.
B000ZIYJ2C|5.0|The music is fantastic.  We even purchased the CD soundtrack.  The acting was wonderful... very good move.  We love it !!!!!
B00942G4UA|5.0|If you were ever concerned about the quality of packaged food and what's REALLY in it, WATCH THIS FILM!  If you have diabetes or are seriously overweight because you eat mostly fast food and cheap packaged food, WATCH THIS FILM!  If you have ever wondered where all that beef, pork and chicken that's wrapped in plastic packages in your supermarket come from, WATH THIS FILM!  NOW, more than ever, we need to educate ourselves about what is happening to our food!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how the game works, it has great features and good graphics. I also like the variety of horse breeds, which even has unicorns! I would definitely recommend this game to any horse lover :)
B0026QC0YU|4.0|...albeit a tour de force for Tom Cruise who also co-produced it and the whole series.  This first one was fun, lots of action, lots of times when one must simply be willing to go along actively suspending disbelief over details and scene to scene action.  Just enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a good time.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|At first this game was awesome, but soon I would try to open it and it would close back up, so I uninstalled it and tried to get it back but it wouldnt let me but other than that I liked it :l Oh and BTW after a while everybody just stopped playing so I couldnt even play anymore.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a very good book dealing with so ;many of the old issues of healthcare and discrimination.  A must read for nurses.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I am so glad I never slipped into the drug habit like so many others have done. It's amazing he lived, can still function, and can help others struggling with addiction. Some times I had to put the book down it was as if you were right there witnessing his downfall.
159463176X|4.0|I haven't finished it yet - matter of fact I just started it. So far - looks like it's going to be an excellent read. His other two books &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;The Sun Also Rises&#34; were excellent!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book...enjoyed reading it on the kindle.  Loved being able to read it at night while I was travelling.  Great book.
0307913147|5.0|I've had a couple of acquaintances rave about this book but when one of my best friends and one of the only 3 people in the world I trust at all said \\"You have got to read this book!\\" I took him up on it. Oddly enough I had just bought it the day before but had put it in the 'To read one day' pile.<br /><br />It was awesome. The 80s references alone made it worth reading but the action and characters and plot, combined with the 80s references, really made the entire thing something truly rare and special.  Kudos to the author, an amazing job was done with this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have always enjoyed this game and on the kindle this is no exception.  Is alot of fun to play and enjoy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Sounds almost too simple but it's absolutely addictive!  I've gotten finger cramps from being unable to stop playing. Sometimes I find myself shifting from side to side trying to &quot;push&quot; the coins off the ledge. Best free game I've ever gotten. Like Mikey said &quot;Try it - you'll  like it!&quot;
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Have always enjoyed this game and on the kindle this is no exception.  Is alot of fun to play and enjoy.
1575666286|3.0|Although I have not read the book completely, on the few chapters and sections which I read, I think the information contained in it could be outdated, old and potentially harmful to the reader's health.  Proceed with caution.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Have always enjoyed this game and on the kindle this is no exception.  Is alot of fun to play and enjoy.
B00CELB94E|5.0|I love this CD, it's the best thing since the last Oasis record.  Listening to it with the speakers cranked up, addicted to Liam's voice--coolest rock singer on Planet Earth.  Oasis is/was my favorite band and I love everything in their catalog, so this is like OXYGEN, need it, can't live without it, want more more more.
B0086700CM|3.0|Have this game and on the kindle and it is okay to play.  Can't quite get the hang of it, but I am a little older.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|A person must take total responsibility for himself/herself in order to be healed. My grief counselor recommended this book. I highlighted several quotes from the book. Peck's word were subtly harsh in some parts. Life is difficult. Once we acknowledge that life is difficult, we must transcend life difficulties in order to grow. When we fail to deal with the uncomfortable parts of life, we begin suffering from mental illness. Dealing with life is hard! Life is filled with pain and loss. We must get through the pain and losses in life. We never get over them. I recommend this book for anyone seeking psychotherapy.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Have always enjoyed this game and on the kindle this is no exception.  Is alot of fun to play and enjoy.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Dark (sometimes, so dark), yet still beautifully light and pure and insightful, in only the way a child protagonist could've done.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This was fun and entertaining.  Spent time with it entertaining me..enjoyed watching it.  Cute especially if you like cats or kittens.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am so pissed that this author made is wait so long and still did not finish the story making the fans wait yet again. Don't delay the release this time. Book is good but totally left us hanging.
B0089BSLUS|5.0|This is the first album of antony that I purchase. I am familiar with his music and this album is awesome. Its a live album recorded in copenhagen...i think. Anyways its a great album. I suggest it to any antony fan
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Hilarious! My favorite line in the whole movie. Steve Carell is one of my favorite actors and really does well in this animated flick.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The Eagles are by far the best band ever....bar none!!  If you get a chance to see them live....you should do it - none of us are getting any younger!!  If you can't see them live....get this DVD - it will provide the history of the band...and provide you some 'almost live' concert footage!! Enjoy!

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It has great detail and the dinosaurs sound great but it was a little complicated and could have had more directions. It also is slow and a battery waster. It is still a really fun game.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a great time with this game. It's challenging, but not difficult. I wish it had more than 10 levels!
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It gave enough detail to many aspect of a professional soldiers life, without  being a big brag, and enough to understand the real life pressures the live through.<br />I totally enjoyed this book!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Brilliant! Beautifully done. An excellent mix of action, moral dilemma, and commentary on our own times. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great job but I think the horses should start off as a baby horse so everyone will get to feed it like a real horse feeds forever
B00CRS88IO|4.0|Whether every single thing in this book happened is beside the point (although Admiral Darlan did die under mysterious circumstances in 1942, and Fleming did work for the Naval Intelligence Unit during World War II). Even if every word were fiction, Stevenson tells a story pinned onto enough history that you won't have to worry about having to suspend disbelief too many times.<br /><br />The British are trying to secure the sophisticated French fleet for the British in the middle of the war; more importantly, they're also trying to keep the Germans away from it. Although even at this point the smart money is betting against a German victory, the question is how quickly they can bring about an end to the war. Keeping the French fleet away from the Germans will help it end that much sooner. Fleming's role is to pay Darlan in British gold to turn over the fleet. Unfortunately, he parachutes into France just as the Germans are securing their hold on the country. Suddenly the mission is much more interesting.<br /><br />If you enjoy James Bond stories, you'll enjoy this one: there's fast-paced adventure, high-stakes international intrigue and lots of on-the-fly ingenuity- all while floating through elite society and bedding beautiful women. As a life-long fan of James Bond movies, I found a lot to enjoy here. However, I'm taking off a point because there were several action sequences that simply lost me, even after multiple re-reads. (For the record, I have the same problem with the movie versions.) Still, I enjoyed the book, especially because the plot was plausible and I could relate to the conflict.<br /><br />Recommended for James Bond fans.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The entire series has been fantastic. I dreaded Shadowfever because I knew it was the last in the series. Karen Marie Moning rewarded her readers for their loyalty by filling it full of everything we had all been waiting for.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I seriously love this movie so much. I can't believe I didn't see it in the theater. I missed out! But I've got it now and I watched it like three times already. Emma Stone is adorable, and hey everyone can relate to the storyline. Buy it!
030758836X|2.0|Loved the suspense of this book during the book. However, the ending was just AWFUL!!! Unless you like books that just fall off at the ending, don't waste your time. I really wanted to like this book. It also took half to book for get \\"good\\".
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you love WW 2 history you must read this book. It reads like a novel, Makos did an incredible job! Where is Hollywood when you need them? I laughed, I cried what a fantastic story. Thank you Charlie Brown and hats off to Franz Stigler!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing locked room games. I used to play them on my old PC. This game is so much better. It is a fun and challenging game. I hope there is more to come.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Wonderful there are at least seven major songs on this album.  I would recommend this album to everyone interested in music
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen Help was very interesting but predictable and a little drawn out in parts.  However, it kept my attention, and the story was a good one.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am so glad that my daughter found this game.  I have played it many times everyday for the last 6 months and it just keeps getting better with more and more dragons.  It is competitive too since my daughter also plays daily and we are never more than one level apart.  We race to see who will get the new dragons first.  Great job Backflip studios and game designers.  This one is a winner.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app keeps me occupied. Not too easy, but not too hard either. Ready to see how challenging it gets.
B005HED11Y|3.0|The show was great but the video stopped momentarily a couple of times. Could be a bandwidth issue but I haven't had this problem with Netflix
B00956UPSW|4.0|Im crazy about this band. Ive followed them since day 1 and they have continued to grow musically and remain interesting.
B002H5HJ9G|4.0|We've seen it before and loved it, just wanted to see again after the first season of Hannibal. Bought the HD version of Red Dragon but it wasn't HD! The quality made it look like we were watching a VHS. I was happy to get an email about getting a $1 rebate bc the rental was a qualifying purchase. I would've been happier if I didn't think I was renting a HD version in the first place, but that was a nice way for Amazon to try and remedy the issue.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Any lover of Streisand and her music will have to have this movie in their collection.  Yentl is a definite recommend.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|The book was an entertaining read even though at parts it seems too fantastical for a historical novel. Have to like Harry though.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel, and as far as movie adaptations go it's not the worst I've seen. It needs to be understood that this book is over 600 pages long, and in order to condense it, things needed to be cut. Also, because of it's author this movie was scoffed at by many before they even saw it. Yes, it's Stephenie Meyer who is now infamous for catering only towards young romantics, but that doesn't strictly apply towards The Host. This book/movie is such a step away from the Twilight series and not many were able to see that. Yes, there is kissing and romance, but at it's core, The Host was a story about love and its varying forms. Meyer herself said The Host was science fiction for people who don't like science fiction, and I think that is 100% accurate. The story itself is something to marvel at; aliens invading and taking over bodies might not be a first, however the specific story line of the movie is.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, the fact that Saoirse Ronan was able to portray two completely different people in the same body is amazing. There isn't an easier way to have the two main characters talk to each other when they share a body than voice overs. They were necessary to the plot despite what people may say about how they sounded. She has since become one of my favorite actresses since seeing this movie and her other work. Max Irons was incredible as Jared Howe, and while not a huge fan of Ian O'Shea, I felt that Jake Abel did a wonderful job. All of the supporting cast was good as well, and helped to further the story line. The music was great and I found the movie to be well worth the money I spent on it.<br /><br />While it may be beneficial to first read the book if you are easily lost in a movie, it's not necessary. They were able to get the basic story line across and that is what matters with an adaptation. Overall, I loved the film and look forward to seeing it many more times to come.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love the way Follett integrates careful research to a good story. Already looking forward to the next book in the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely amazing story. Love the romance the eroticness I think this series is one of the best. There is no comparing this to any other series out There. Must read
B008B68IUY|4.0|Well what can i say, i bought this for my 6 year old daughters birthday and she loves it, drives it all over the house!!  Fits four dolls, thought i broke the seat belts within the first 10 min of having it out of the box ha ha my kids figured out how to get it back in place tho... I'm not good with those things! Overall i would buy it again cause now when my boys play with their trucks my daughter can pull out her car and load her monster high dolls in it! :)
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty is about as American as you can be. He came up from humble roots and spent his life traveling this nation with the same sharp eye and adept ear other American Icons did before him. Like Twain and Whitman, Fogerty not only appreciates the spirit of place and the character of its people, he also has something to say to them. Americans have listened to him and his amazing music for more than four decades, but has never fully appreciated the depths of his vision, which has never been more viable than it is now.<br />Wrote A Song For Every One is a fine, exhuberent colection of retooled favorites with a couple of fresh surprises thrown in, most notably Mystic Highway, a song that reflects on this journey called life in a way that is hopeful and still awed by wonder. Fogerty is no longer a young man, but his soul is still fresh and full of fire, even as he confronts mortality and looks back on his life.<br />The disc comes with a booklet that addresses each song in a very personal way, with Foerty explaining what inspired him to write it. The first tune, Fortunate Son, is Fogerty's reaction to the draft which miraculously neglected to pull in many millionaire or senators' sons. It took his life for awhile, and he saw others lose theirs forever, but he, like many of us, has no idea why. This song is so relevant today, I suggest it becomean anthem for the 99% of us who are sick of becoming casualties of the war machine, of greed, of a corrupt government and systems that have slowly pushed Democracy under the thumbs of bullies who literally get away with murder.<br />It ain't me, I can hear protestors scream in the streets they need to occupy sooner than later. It ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one. While he was not born with a silver spoon to help himself and has not been blessed with star spangled eyes, Fogerty is an American of the truest kind.<br />He says when Born On the Bayou came to him during sound check at an early music festival, he was invested in realizing the melody of this great song. A rude show biz boob in the shadows said something dismissive about this effort and insinuated CCR would never be around to see stardom and this, according to Fogerty, instigated his impudent and persistant reach for what is clearly his. Born on the Bayou is probably my favorite CCR song because it so captures the swampy, stark nature of life in New Orleans' underbelly of voodoo, strange fruit and wild ritualistic Bacchanals from the perspective of a native. I sometimes choke when I sing the words \\" I can still those hound dogs barking, chasing down a who do there.\\" It is hard to believe Fogerty channeled up such an astute regional sensibility with the sociopolitical implications without actually growing up on this bayou. But it is just one of many songs that put us in a time and place so viable, we get it, even if we don't get it.<br />With that said, the Kid Rock duet of this song is not what I hoped for. Certainly, Kid Rock seemed to me lie the most inspired choice of all these stars on the album, and the song choice was sublime. However, the chorus, while catchy, is problematic because it is too refined and smooth to do this song justice. I prefer the original, but forgive this flaw simply because I cannot shake the pop like crooning out of my troubled head.<br />Since I am on the shortcomings of the album, I will also opine that Proud Mary was wasted on Jennifer Hudson. She has a fine voice and adequately adopts a southern swing in her version. This song is most famously sung by Tina Turner, however, and she even out does Fogerty in the way she belts it out. It would have been kind of interesting to see her pair up with Fogerty for this now standard rock and roll classic.<br />Hudson's talents would have been better used in something more unlikely. Perhaps Born on te Bayou or Bad Moon A Rising.<br />Lodi, Around the Bend, Looking Out My Backdoor are all done very well and with a fresh twist. Alan Jackson, who I know nothing of, sings with Fogerty in a country style I cannot dismiss as much as I am inclined to. My favorite song on the album is tough to call, but when Fogerty's sons sing & play  with him, I think this offers the most genuinely joyous aspect of an album of great songs that Fogerty wrote for everyone, and this includes himself.<br />He has never been arrested for trashing motel rooms or dating 14 year old groupies. He has never had a public battle with addictions to heroin or kiddie porn. When on stage, his band was always tight, professional and sober enough to appease fans. His songs are deceptively simple and sincere instead of perverse and strange. You don't see Behind the Music exposes about the band at odds or addled by booze and bimbos. Fogerty has never been mentioned in National Enquirer or merited unauthorized tell alls by Goldman, Kelly or other sleazy biographers. He has never made a comeback or offered apologetic headlines about recovery from bad behavior. Instead he has twisted his angst into music and lyrics that mean much to us as individuals and as members of the 99% that is nobody. He is not quite a nobody but I am not sure I'd recognize him in a crowd. If I did, I probably would not embarass him by fawning or asking for his autograph. I imagine many fans feel this way. It is a certain respect Forgerty has earned from an intelligent and eclectic fan base that includes several generations of Americans, including the kids weened on oldies and hanging on to them for lack of anything close in their choice of  pop tart driven drivel and hip hop postures that stand as music for their time. It isn't.<br />As Fogerty learned the hard way, the business of music is ruthless, rigid and long lost to greed and stupidity.<br />But the classics live on, and so should this little digression from the gutless crap churned out by the likes of Septugenarian sell outs like the Rolling Stones, smarmy careerist no accounts like cold play, the billigerent excess of medocrity and sex as Beyonce, Aguilar and others blast us with... All of it is s***ake. Fogerty is the real deal. Buy this album.untry style I cannot dismiss as much as I am inclined to.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good game I like the sound when the bird crashes.Its a funny sound.You should download this game it has many levels so you can play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. It is very easy to use and i use it all the time. I lime the big keys as my eyes aren't as good as they use to be.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I was disappointed in this one, not one of his better books.  For me, it had far too much detail on bombs and not enough on the people.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I have seen many Les Miserables movies and read the book back in high school in the 60's. I was disappointed in this movie. The music was great and the scene with Sacha Cohen Baron was extremely funny. The scenery was fantastic but the story was really disjointed. I had a difficult time following. If you turn your head for a second you might miss an important part of the movie. I watched about an hour and a half then I couldn't handle it anymore. Plus I could not handle the constant singing instead of talking (and I love Opera). Russell Crowes's \\"singing\\" will make you cringe. I suppose if you look at this movie as just a musical and don't compare any of it to Les Miserables then maybe it won't be so bad. The best version, in my opinion, is Bernard's 1934 movie...like 5 hours long. I bought that from Amazon about 5 years ago and have already watched it twice. Way better than the Liam Neeson version. I gave this musical 3 stars because it is very creative. I could not get into the characters, in fact, I couldn't even follow them. Don't know what all the talk was about this movie. I love musicals: West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, Sound of Music, Romance and Cigarettes, The Singing Detective (British version), Jesus Christ Superstar etc.. but this one was way off the mark from the original story. My youngest son and his Japanese wife loved this version. My son hasn't seen the others, though. I haven't seen Phantom of the Opera Musical but now I am hesitant to give it a try.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Caught a couple of the season 2 episodes on usa and wanted to see where it all started and now I'm obsessed!! Awesome show
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I won't claim to be a competitive, expert or professional swimmer by any means. What I am is someone who spends six days a week in the pool working on the freestyle stroke. As my swimming progressed and I was able to go longer distances more easily, I started seeking out waterproof MP3 players.<br /><br />I bought one of the cheap cylinder designs which failed within a month of me buying it. The buttons stopped responding, a common complaint. I then moved onto a JLab headset for something a little less fiddly. The JLab has great sound and stayed in my ears easily, but it has a point of failure in the form of the USB port. I managed to keep one going for three months or so before the final water infiltration that killed it. Enough was enough. I was done spending money on items that were so easily ruined despite claims otherwise. It was time to go for broke and splurge on the Finis Neptune.<br /><br />I was aware of the SwiMP3, but stayed away from it due to the reviews of random troubles. Then the Neptune came out and I waited for reviews to show up. Once a few had hit Amazon, I made up my mind. I held my breath and clicked order. I eagerly awaited the arrival of the Neptune and my next opportunity to swim.<br /><br />Neptune arrived, I loaded it up with songs and got to the pool. I was instantly in heaven. I can hear the music above and below water easily, but I'm cursed with sensitive hearing, so that may be just me. I put earplugs in which makes it even easier to hear the music and off I went. I am a happy camper to say the least.<br /><br />I do have some minor quibbles in that the music fidelity doesn't seem to be as good as it could be, but again, that may be me being able to pick up on a lack of depth in the music even with the equalizer. Some of the songs IDs don't read properly on the player but that's not a major issue for me. I did have a problem with the sides of the \\"earphones\\" pushing into my skull (I can't swim with a cap for this reason), but I solvedthat by putting on a headband and using it as a cushion for the areas that were poking me.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, as someone else says, it works. It works well in fact. I highly recommend it for people looking for a way to not be bored in the pool. You can really tune out your mind while swimming with the Finis Neptune player.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Highly addictive and entertaining. A great download. The only downside is the cost of in-game coins and stars. Still, a fun game.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I like Mumford and Sons better.  This band is worth a listen, but I'm not sure how their individual sound is going to develop and if I'd want to purchase this album again (or a future album).  Just not enough there for me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once I started, I didn't want to put it down.  king is a master storyteller, and weaver of fact and fiction.
0446580848|2.0|I've read all the books from Nelson Demille, I was really looking forward to the Panther. I liked the fact that Demille used my 2 favorite characters John Correy and Paul Brenner. But in the end this was the only surprise in the book. Definitly The Panther doesn't belong to my Demille hitlist, i just went on with my reading because i hoped that in the end the story would improve. but unfortunatly it didn't
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is not as dark as the first two I thought. As always the characters are three dimensional and there are no easy choices.  Situations are not always what they seem on the surface.  Very good read.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Just got back from Springfield Illinois.  So glad I red the book before, it gave me some insight into Lincoln's life after he left Springfield.
006178480X|4.0|This is a good book.  It is written by James Rollins, so how could it be a bad book?  I just don't think it lived up to the other Sigma Force novels.  Some Sigma Force novels have been better than others.  I enjoyed this one, but it isn't my favorite.  It just seemed a little bit less mysterious than previous novels.  I miss the Guild - that really took some of the punch out of the storyline.  I think, as much as I hate to say it, that Sigma Force might be winding down.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|so here we have the much laughed at abahadabra.a departure from previous albums, even in sorti diabolic. new look, not what we thought they were really right? well, yea. at least a little bit. at first glance, a TRUE die hard fan of these guys, (and by that I mean they've made some of the most memorable and relistenable music ive ever heard, and I love mayhem, immortal, you get it) and it was a sad departure at first, I thought the same for puritania, and was wrong there as well. the beginning of the album was really a yawn fest, rabid anticipation waiting on something good, and gateways has some really OLD SCHOOL DIMMU BORGIR, if you really like these guys youll hear it. then a filler, then dimmu borgir, id been waiting with a lot of anticipation for their title song and though it wasn't what I thought they could've done with it, it is awesome, not super brutal, but full of that horrid beauty in darkness I think they've always tried putting to the emotion of their music. they really surprised me at the last couple tracks though, and though vortex is missed, he really isn't. they get get brutal. master of disharmony brutal. so while not the pinnacle of their career that enthrone darkness triumphant was, it is another great release. don't be a sheep, make your mind up for yourself.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I suppose that the third book is better than the second, and even the first. Eva's and Gideon's characters are developing rather interesting, and I a'm impatiently waiting for the forth book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great product leaves all of my knives very sharp i have also used the smith's that is adjustable but like this one alot better it is amazing!!!
B00BWJ91XK|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars if they didn't split the movie up. I would enjoy watching it again and again.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|The story was thin, the sex predictable and boring.  I simply read it to get it over with.  And I will probably not read the last book.<br />Very disappointing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have enjoyed this game. the graphics are great. the music is nice. it works well on my kindle fire!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The only bad thing about this book was the cliff hanger ending.  Now we wait for the latest and greatest to come...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been waiting all of the off season for it to become available.  With my time constraints its hard to watch each episode as it is first released, this provides the perfect way for me to keep up even though I have to wait several months to watch. Thanks Amazon!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty cool app. Needs more levels and then maybe as the levels get harder have a 'hint' button.  I would say it is a good time killer and neat.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This has been one of the best trilogies that I've read.  However, to see these 2 characters grow together has been a wonderful thing to read.  I can't wait to see where they head next and what challenges they're going to face!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The Book should have not ended the way it did. I sure hope there is another book coming. The book left a lot to be desired.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. Fun and easy.  Challenging and forces you to think outside the book.  Ive played other games similar and this one is very fun.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the story but at times it´s too slow and there are some cliches... that I don´t think they needed to make the story a good one.
0062515675|5.0|Will make you reflect about your life and your day to day decisions and outlook. I'm having my whole family read it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|My 9 year old son loves this movie!  He has watched it at least 4 times.  After watching the movie he started reading all the Tintin books that he could find.
B001AX60KU|5.0|loved the set the packaging was awsome, the box set was terrific. easy to uase and good looking a great treasure too my collection thanks alot
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love a challenging puzzle and The Room is wonderful. True, it is too short, but we'll worth $1.99. I can't wait for more.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is awesome I love injustice wished that u could ride your pet dragon and and please add railroad tracks if u add this if I could I would rate 1 million stars
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Daughter enjoys game a lot.  The make up choices are neat. Love the accesory choices lots of fun to occupy time.
B001P1FZDK|5.0|Reading the reviews of this album is interesting: Seems those who like offbeat stuff and hate commercial pop hate the album. Those who are turned off by artsy stuff but like the more familiar flows of conventional pop love the album. To me this album is the perfect compromise: You've got catchy pop tunes overlain on top of some pretty interesting and complex time signatures, rhythms and electronic effects. Most songs engage the listener by either teasing them into thinking something is going to happen in the song which never happens, or, delivering on that tease, but not in the way the listener expects, or not *when* the listener expects. This could have been a much simpler album, but it is not. It has a sheen of commercial pop, but that sheen is only skin deep. There is some pretty complex and sophisticated music underneath the polished surface.<br /><br />In spite of a couple songs which sound just a wee bit too much like 80's techno-pop, I rate the album a 5 anyway. It's easy to create free-flow artsy jumbles of sound, and it's easy to create standard commercial pop. It is *not* easy to create a perfect synthesis of both and pull it off successfully. This album has achieved that.<br /><br />Since buying this album less than a week ago, I think I've listened to it probably ten times by now. It's clear to me this album *could* someday be mentioned in the same breath as pop/rock classics such as Sgt Pepper's or Rumours. The only question is whether AC will decide to create additional albums of similar quality to get themselves noticed more by the mainstream; or whether they remain content to be a somewhat, but not spectacularly, well-known indie band.

1439153663|3.0|Before reading this novel, I had the expectation that it was going to be gripping and unforgettable, but it definitely fell short of it.  The plot was not engrossing; it had a typical story line where the young white innocent girl grows up with an African American family in the late 1700s in America, not noticing the physical difference between her African American family and herself.  It was a decent attempt at character development, portraying Lavinia (the young white indentured servant girl from Ireland) as selfless and consistently proving her unconditional love for her African American family, and Belle (the young mulatto slave girl, fathered by her master) as a headstrong young woman, but only a helpless bystander in the white man's world.  The characters had potential, but their personalities were way too extreme.  It was not relatable, which is one of the most important traits a good historical fiction novel should have.  The audience wants to be taken back to that time and feel what the people of that time had felt, and this just did not do it.<br /><br />Lavinia was too pure, even at the age of 17, she only partly understood that her skin color was different from that of her adopted family.  After the turmoil she had been through, there should have been more internal conflict within her to love her adopted family the same or to have that love falter.  Even though her love for her family was unconditional, it just was not portrayed very intensely, which would have made the novel much more enticing.  It was not touching; the audience understands the lowly status of African Americans during this time, and the way in which the white male dominated society, and this understanding should have made me cried when I realized how unconditional and ahead of her time Lavinia's love for her family was.  Grissom just did not touch on that aspect enough.  She made Lavinia's love natural and modern, which was disappointing.  I wanted to see Lavinia struggle and finally realize that skin color and social norms did not determine love.  As for Belle, she talked headstrong, but never really acted on any of her actions until the end of the novel.  She just seemed helpless, always a damsel in distress.  Her heroic moments were definitely overshadowed by her helplessness.<br /><br />Overall, this novel was just simply alright.  It was nothing too exciting, but I did want to know the ending, and it was sweet.alize that skin color and social norms did not determine love.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game because my brother had gotten it and told me it was a lot of fun.  That was MONTHS ago and I am still hooked on it.  It changes places about every month.  There are characters that reflect the place.  Love this game!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great game! It is a challenging fun game that keeps getting more levels! The only con is it isn't that challenging. Get this game.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I would have read this book, no matter what, since I have read all the books in this series.  I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad it is the last one, because it was time for Sookie's story to come to an end.

B00493E1GI|1.0|I wish this movie was better. You could only hope that a movie with such actors would be reasonably entertaining, amusing and/or likable. Unfortunately, the movie is not engaging and we frequently found ourselves asking &#34;What?&#34; and &#34;Why&#34;? When I learned that this movie was first a book, I realized its one of those movies that attempts to follow the book's storyline to a fault -- probably not satisfying fans of the book and leaving other viewers feeling like they missed something.  Probably the most disappointing aspect is that the main characters give you little reason to &#34;root for them&#34; and don't really have any development. It seems like Julia Robert's character is supposed to learn something, but in the end, you wonder if she's changed at all or moved forward in any way.<br /><br />And the scenery, which seems to be noted a positive aspect of this movie by other reviewers, is nice, but given the material, and what other movies have done with the same settings, is boring. Poor cinematography?<br /><br />This movie gets a single star, not because its the worst movie ever made (it isn't), but because it falls so short of modest expectations of entertainment and the potential (source material, actors, budget, etc.) for a good movie.

B008AIGWVA|5.0|Omg I love this app I definitely recommend it also if you like this then get talking ginger or talking Tom 2 ;3
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I think the novel began  to get good for me around Chapter 5. Took a while for me to pick it back up once I started reading, I was lucky to read a chapter a day. Once I reached Chapter 5 it finally was interesting.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Most of the reviews here are very much in line with the industry reviews, so the highest praise I can give this release is to say this is the very first Queensrÿche purchase I've ever made. I'd never really listened to Queensrÿche before the drama of the past year caught my attention, and at first, it was really more like watching a train wreck: disturbing and fascinating at the same time. When I discovered the YouTube singles, I checked them out and was really surprised by how much I liked them. By the time I heard \\"Where Dreams Go to Die,\\" I was sold. I immediately pre-ordered the album.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later, a friend of mine told me Queensrÿche was going to be in Houston the next day (on June 8), but he didn't know which version it was. I did a quick search and found out it was these guys. So I went. By this time, I'd started working my way through their back catalog on Rhapsody. I wasn't as intimately familiar with the songs as most of the other concert goers, but I knew them well enough to know that Todd was the real deal, not merely an imitator. His voice was absolutely incredible. For 90 straight minutes, he ruled that stage and owned every song.<br /><br />When the band made the album available for streaming on their site a week before release, I listened to it multiple times that day. I found that it more than fulfilled the promise of the three YouTube singles. Despite multiple repeat listens throughout the week, I found myself eagerly awaiting the arrival of the CD. I wanted *my* copy.<br /><br />Well, now I have it, and I haven't stopped playing it. I also have their first six releases (EP through Promised Land), having bought them with my Father's Day cash. Now I'll just pretend that the band took an extended hiatus after 1994, and have simply come back with a new (incredible) singer and a new guitarist (who wrote my favorite song on the album, \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\"), and my discography is complete.<br /><br />This is no nostalgia act. This is an incredible album, written and performed by a band that is insanely talented. They are hungry and have something to prove. They've proven it to me. I recommend you let them prove it to you, too.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|This is a great movie and worthy of the stars.  My only concern is that, like many pseudo historical picks, it bends the facts.  All POWs I have spoken to complain about the collaboration between the Colonel and the Japanese
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful story of love and loss.....interwoven with a history of a part of the world so foreign to most of us.  I was unable to put this book down as the story lines all caught me and kept me attached to the bigger picture Hosseini created.  Read it and you will feel the pull of these characters.  I did.
B00760BPOC|4.0|I have now read the whole series. I have spent several months in a very different, medieval, type of world, full of wars and cruelty. It does make good reading, however, and you get very drawn in. The main characters become very familiar and part of your life. I have only rated it four because there were so many characters I found it increasingly hard to keep up with who was who. The author has, however, included an appendix listing them all. It's very realistic, with the supernatural being only a very small part of it. The dragons lend a fascinating touch, being ever-present without actually appearing very much until the end. The story covers what is going on simultaneously in all the different lands of this strange world.
B002YCVWXQ|1.0|Dear Amazon,<br /><br />Again I rented an &#34;HD&#34; movie but the quality was far from it... I did not even finish the film..<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Gonzalo.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it, Use it nearly every day for something.  It is  very  user friendly and easy to use. I must have more words to post so here they are.  It is Great!
B007HLIUN4|5.0|It's a great book. I am deeply impressed by their scholarship. They know so much about the world. Their book covers all of them, all over the continents, from New Stone Age to the present. It is a great pleasure to read all the examples of economic success and failure. My only complaint is that the discussion of the theory is not deep enough, but I know this is not their faults as this book is intended for the general public. Instead of an explicit discussion of their theory, they just embed the theory in the examples. For more in depth discussion of the theory, I have to read their papers in academic journals.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this for my husband who is a photographer, he use to use 2 bag to carry all his lenses and carera. Now they all fit in one. He LOVEs this bag!
B0078XFYDA|4.0|This is a great introductory book on the scientific method, with discussions of fundamental issues surrounding the nature of reality, life, and the universe around us.  It is written in clear language that should be accessible to middle school students or even advanced elementary students.  My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, is that several concepts cry out for illustrations, which would be particularly helpful for younger readers.  While the illustrations at the beginning of each chapter are nicely done, they are not expository in nature.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|It has been one of my family's favorite movies for a long time.  It's just nice to have it here, ready to watch, whenever they want to watch it
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|Barbara Streisand and Seth Rogen are great together.  Lots of laughs, many tender moments.  Great movie for moms of young men.

B004TI5N38|4.0|Good suspense and excellent characters.  This book is a very good read in the spirit of the great adventure writers
B000Y1ZXU2|1.0|Warning: if you want a Tool CD this is not it.  This is a DVD.  Although Amazon's entry does have \\"Format: DVD\\" it is in small letters on the right, and the title gives no warning, as some live DVDs do.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I really enjoyed the DVD.  The story was sad however I found it very interesting.  I love dogs. I would recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh not!! This is soooo much raunchier than 50 shades!!! Has the same type of story line as far as girl meets guy that's rich, she thinks she's ugly blah blah blah but the intimate scenes are holy cow!!! Gotta keep it clean for young people reading the review but, wow! I'm addicted and couldn't put it down!! Read the series 5 times and its just as good as the first time around!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Would make a person skip it altogether.  I would never have read it were it not for book club, and it is easily one of the best, most thought provoking books I have read in a long time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! The ending gives a little away for the third book, but it just keeps you intrigued. Definitely a good read!
B00ALCBTWU|5.0|great movie, we enjoyed it all the way through. we have recomended this movie to many people and will continue to do so.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The beginning traps you but it gets kinda slow in some parts but the ending makes it all worth it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a well-written and very thought provoking novel.  Each character appears to be defending Jacob in his/her own way.  Which one is right?  Who was the most effective?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great just you need coins and hearts and stuff to do all stuff and those cost money or take like three hours to get.
B00138D27Q|5.0|i have , i guess that it's probably the most well-known of lou reed's albums. It's really good for a vintage rock thing, I listened to this music while sitting in my grandma's. I don't think that my aunts or uncles listened to lou reed there when they were teenagers.
B003NBFZTE|5.0|I'm 180cm high and 75KG, I seclected Large size and it is prefect fit! I just wear it for 20 mins and feel warm and relaxed. It is amazing! It worth the price, I will buy more SKINS!!! Definitely 400 series.
B003TH2LA8|5.0|It is still a very entertaining television show. Much of the story could not be shown on television and I would not want to see those parts either.
B00B7HQ1DA|3.0|Good covers, more fresh creativity needed.  Boz's voice familiar & strong, if a little aged.  Uses the new timbre effectively on good covers, but seems a bit lacking in the passion that was expressed so well on silk degrees.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very happy with this game. It loaded fast and plays well for a free app. Definitely an app to play
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This app is very cool. You can choose from two avatars and do their hair tons of different ways. When I am shaving the person's hair it makes me feel like they have cancer. It makes me feel that I should be grateful that I am healthy and alive.

B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|There are several solid songs on this album such as hangman's body count but overall it was not their best cd. That being said Volbeat at their worst is still a better band than most. If you like Volbeat this album is for you
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|If you like action and lots of it, it's your movie.  Lots of shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action scenes along with a decent plot.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Good game love it can battle bad guys just a cool game can get boring sometimes though there is this movie u can watch by tapping on the theater I like it
B009O5CLZY|1.0|I get the names of the two people who designed it but it never loads.  Please fix this bug.  Have the game on my iPad and the kids love it.  Would be great if it played on the Kindle Fire.  Please fix this bug!

0062238868|5.0|My hubby can't put down.  For someone who doesn't really read for pleasure, he is cruising through this book.  Can't wait for my turn to read it.
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|many people complained about this album just to hear themselves talk.<br /><br />The production is a little off but the songs hold enough energy and emotion to break through and shine.<br /><br />Top five songs Ma Belle, Tarantula, Stellar, Bring The Light, and Stars.<br /><br />Is this Smashing Pumpkins best album?<br /><br />No, Mellon Collie and Adore are there best albums.<br /><br />Is this a fantastic album with strong tracks, great musical performance, and great vocal performance.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is an awesome show. I work nights on its regularly scheduled time slot so is great to catch up. Then it's included with Amazon Prime, bonus!!! But Alicia is the best blend of good girl gone bad. The cases that take a headline material. Each of the lawyers have just enough skeletons in their closet to keep things interesting!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game, with great graphics. Honestly one of my favorite app's. I'm honestly not much of a horse person, and I don't know much about Horses but this game is easy to understand.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|When I was younger, I loved the beginnings of books because everything seemed easy and happy. I liked hearing about the world, but got uncomfortable when characters started to get into trouble. Why couldn't they just live happily throughout the book? Now, of course, I realize that characters must be thrust into extreme situations and faced with extreme choices so that they can undergo significant changes. I enjoyed reading The Wise Man's Fear, but I enjoyed it in the way I enjoyed reading the stasis of other stories when I was younger.<br /><br />I really like Pat's writing style, and like I said, I liked hearing about Kvothe, the university, and the happenings of the story. But it didn't go beyond that. It was like watching a Saturday morning cartoon--easy to digest and enjoyable in its way, but not provoking, not challenging, and not especially exciting.<br /><br />Honestly, it feels like a personal fantasy--a person imagining a character that's really cool because he wants to see himself as that character. The character always comes out on top. Danger never feels...well...all that dangerous, and in two books, I haven't really seen any significant character development. He DOES things, sure. (***Slight Spoilers***) He plays some music. Catches some bandits. But I can't call to mind a single difficult decision that he had to make. Even when he slaughters a band of imposter traveling players, which he is a little distraught about afterward, it doesn't seem at all like he struggled with his decision to act.<br /><br />In short, The Wise Man's Fear is a fun read. Pat has created a very intriguing world with its own lore, language, and magic that I really like hearing about. Unfortunately, I felt that his character, despite having traveled to many places, has yet to show us a journey.
B00AQ6JVZS|5.0|Woody was great in this movie. Forget Jesse Eisenberg, he's a jerk in real life, which is too bad (check out some of his celebrity interviews on YouTube, he mistreats female interviewers which disappoints me greatly). The ladies were excellent, Emma Stone gave a great performance.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I love this movie better than the new one out now in Theater.....The movie just flows along with the characters all believable.  Robert Redford is wonderful as Gatsby.  .... Daisy is perfectly cast.. I could watch this movie over and over...
B00C061I3K|5.0|I was skeptical I would like this new album as much as I like Discovery. I'm pleasantly surprised that I love the music on this album, especially Instant Crush--classicly Daft Punk, and yet such a creative breath of fresh air. It's my new go-to late-night-working music jam.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I'm so sad because I have no idea how long it will be until the next one!
B008JFUMDS|4.0|I had little to do so I went to see a movie -- this movie.  What I got was a trip into the world of deception and distraction or maybe a glimpse into magic.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It begins by introducing you to four street magicians who live by their wits and ability to distract and deceive.  This alone is worth the price of admission, but the movie centers on how these four charlatans become the super star four horsemen who use their magic to rob banks.  How do they do it?  The twist of course is they never actually rob anyone -- or do they?  The FBI pursues them as bank robbers but they use magic to keep ahead of the authorities.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as an iconolast determined to expose them and show their magic is really just tricks.  The motive and connections to all of these plots and subplots happens at the very end leaving the audience to decide was there magic involved or were they just tricks.  A movie that is intersting and one that captures and keeps your interest from the first minutes. I gave it four stars because the love interest was not necessary and actually seemed to distract from the action, but this is really a small criticism.  It is a good movie and well done.
B000002MUN|5.0|I learned a long time ago. DON'T LISTEN to critics. Listen to the music. I've had this CD since it came out. And, In my opinion. It's one of Tom Petty's best!!! Well, How do I know that??? It's simple. My ear tells me so. Not some Stupid Freaking Critic :-)

B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Michael is one of the top five best composers working in film today, if John williams dosen't do the score to the next star wars film, only Michael should do it.

B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|Very slick attempt to win over the religious crowd by offering this piece of homosexual propaganda at a discount as part of a group of popular Christian films.<br /><br />No doubt trying to win over those who are opposed to the radical gay agenda. Now that DOMA is overturned the gay rights lobby (of which Amazon is definitely a part) has already announced its stated goal of ramming gay marriage down the throats of all 50 states. Even with slick marketing techniques like pushing \\"Moneyball\\" as a quasi-religious movie that will never happen.

B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I was overwhelmed by every aspect of this film. I remember Liberache from the old days of television when I was a little kid. I found him mesmerizing. Over the years, I certainly learned to see him in a different light, but loved his talents none the less. He always seemed genuinely nice, and shared his on stage persona with a wink. When the Scott Thorson story hit the rag sheets, it came as no surprise.<br /><br />Behind the Candelabra, there was another story to be told. The depth of Liberache's public denial seems sad and desperate. It was a reflection of the times in which he rose to fame. Perhaps it is the telling of his story in another era that makes it so fascinating, like going through a looking glass to his personal wonderland.<br /><br />I found this film to be so compelling that I watched it several times in one week. The acting was so great, I felt as though Douglas was channeling Liberache rather than impersonating him. When I read Debbie Reynolds name in the credits, I thought that I must have missed her scene. How could I have not seen her? Only after the first viewing did I realize that it was she who portrayed Liberache's mother!<br /><br />There is so much to admire in this film. The makeup, the sets, the costumes -- all perfection. However, what stays with you is the idea that no matter who the protagonists were, this is a love story -- a love story gone wrong, to be sure, but a love story none the less.<br /><br />Behind the Candelabra is a film that will stay with you for quite some time. It sent me on a journey of research for more information about Liberache's life. Surely, it wasn't easy to live compelled to hide your true nature, yet always be in the public eye.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder what Liberache, himself, would have to say about Behind The Candelabra.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|I like this soundtrack a lot, but there are some songs on it that are a little too boring, but the good songs outweigh the bad ones.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|Hey, it's fantastic, it'll have you surprised and it will keep you laughing. There isn't much more you need to know. These guys are hilarious.
1616550414|5.0|This is the ultimate Zelda book, it contains everything from the Zelda Universe. The front and the back of the book look beautifully, specially if you showcase it. There are various characters designs and trivias, all the Zelda games released in chronological order and of course the timeline and much more. If you are a Zelda fan, this must be in your collection!
B00C6BACF4|5.0|There isn't much to say. This movie is one for the ages and gets funnier with every viewing. It's great.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|What a fun movie.  Comedy, mystery, romance, puzzle, breaks the fourth wall - the movie does it all.  A fine European cast, well subtitles for English-only folkses like me, a lot of fun to watch - really drags you into the movie.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Lego toys are good for children. The only thing is they are small pieces and grandson loses them at times.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Book was awesome!!! Definite MUST BUY! I can't wait to read the next book! Ordering it as soon as possible to enjoy more great stories'
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The story is disturbing enough but Jennifer Carpenter's performance is chilling.  Laura Linney is pure genius in her role as a hard nosed no BS attorney who life has been invaded.<br /><br />Great exploration of possible explanations for things we humans don't understand - whether you're agnostic, athiest, devout Catholic or whatever - get a package of DEPENDS - there are creepy enough moments to give you the willies.<br /><br />Enjoy.

8866135887|5.0|I am so in love with this moleskin planner! It makes SUCH a big difference that it is an 18 month rather than a 12 month. For planners such as myself, I couldn't have ordered a better daily planner!
B009LDXQGC|5.0|They are a great band~~ have seen them in concert<br />and put on a fantastic show.  Very melodical and beat<br />conscience. Am seeing them again soon and will be<br />able to sing along this time..(-: I recommend this cd<br />and will purchase more to supplement my collection.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A potentially great story hindered by mediocre writing. The subject matter is compelling but lacking in execution. Marcus De Sade did it better.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|Discovered this band on Pandora..they've been around for awhile<br />but I am glad I purchased this cd and will definately buy some more<br />by this great band.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was a very nice challenge. keeps your brain thinking. it is also very time consuming. try it. you'll love it
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Fantastic band and fantastic cd. Looking<br />forward to someday seeing them live... Great<br />music, fun to listen to and even my 13 yr old<br />grandson thinks they are a band to contend<br />with!

B0042FZOFU|1.0|I am very upset that my package wasn't packed more securely, it arrived broken in pieces. Since this is A Disney Pixar movie it is collectible and worth nothing damaged. When i reviewed my options for return their was no option for exchange and I now have to wait around for the ups to arrive for return.  Not to mention refund takes up to 4 weeks and I fear if I order the blu ray box set again the same incident will occur.  I am very disappointed with my purchase and would really like a undamaged Toy story collection box set.

B004HX4RT6|5.0|Is a very good source of enjoyment during the day to help pass the time .. and it has different levels .. very nice
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This Game is very good. And for free too! It may be short, but perplexing enough to keep going and find an answer.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Fantastic.  I love the story and how Sylvia developed it.  Desperate for #4. I hoped that someone make a movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Love it definitely . It's addictive it's hard to put down .I play the game every day and night .Love the graphics on this game.I'm really not a game player but this definitely changes it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent story. Love how it is packaged as one book for the kindle app. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great story and a quick read.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a HUGE HP fan, but have never bought any of the movies. When I first saw this set online, I was so excited! After reading some of the negative reviews, I decided to take my chances and get it, and I am so glad that I did! It came in a couple days (with Amazon Prime), and the price was fantastic! $40 for 8 DVDs... how can you complain? Within a week I had watched all eight movies and encountered zero problems with this collection. Each disc was in the box with its corresponding movie poster image on the disc. The menus are not simply still images, they are moving menus with music. The movies all played perfectly fine. As for what people have said about special features or lack thereof... that part doesn't really matter to me. There are a few, which I haven't checked out yet, but remember, many of the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" and interviews with the cast are available for free on YouTube! The movies in their entirety are not, and I bought this set purely for the movies. If you ARE, however, looking for a ton of bonus features, then spend a lot more money on a different collection. If, like me, you just want to have the movies to watch (over and over... and over), then this set is a GREAT deal and one of the best purchases I have made. I would highly recommend it.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|a good thriller with a solid cast. perhaps the fact that they are all babes helps. that's all i got...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a good game but the horses are to expensive. It is kind of slow though. I give it 3 stars.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was so predictable and had every Disney cliche in it known to Hollywood. If you've seen one Disney movie, you've seen them all.  How many times are we going to see the poisoned apple routine in a Disney film? The CGI effects were terrible and cringe-worthy. The movie was all about putting one over on people, lying and misrepresenting yourself for the greater good. The same old story of a handful of people thinking they know what's best for the masses. The public at large are sheeple who need a hero and all that garbage.<br /><br />Not a great message for kids.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a wild roller coaster ride from a book. It really kept me on my toes!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I love the show-not sure about a couple of the leading actors for this Ann show.  The lead, Alfie, (ahthough a tremendous singer) can't act, and can't use emotion in his singing.  Every song he sings is in perfect pitch, but doesn't due much else-and Nick Jonas-please, him as Marius????? -  Every time he sang, he took me right out of the show,  Bad choice.  NIck belongs in a rock band but not on the broadway stage.  He doesn't have the voice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The the update of villagers and  slime and spawning eggs is awesome download now to see how it really is
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|When Mavis Staples voluntarily collaborated with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy for her 2010 album [[ASIN:B003RDPYCG You Are Not Alone]], it won a Grammy Award. But in all honest I simply wasn't taken it by the musical collaboration behind it. And still am not. Mavis Staples as a vocal talent and cultural icon is incomparable. And in his time Jeff Tweedy has a tremendous musical talent all his own. Now I'm aware of the Staple Singers folk-soul back round in their salad days. Yet Mavis seems to function better when the instrumentation is more closely attuned to her own talents. What made me stream this album to give it another try,since I wasn't interested in buying it was hearing Mavis herself comment that, while she found her Staples classics very easy and natural for her that Tweedy's song selections presented more of a vocal challenge for her. So the results of this album,while not ideal are a bit more appealing to me personally than its predecessor.<br /><br />  \\"Holy Ghost\\" begins the album with Tweedy's very gentle acoustic guitar playing to Mavis's own little gospel symphony of vocals. \\"Every Step\\" starts out with a similar acoustic based blues before a stark reverved funk rhythm comes in to give the song some extra edge. Mavis does George Clinton's \\"Can You Get To That Here\\",actually a far cleaner recorded version that Funkadelic's 1971 original,yet is extremely true instrumentally and vocally to the original. One of the favorite things I've ever heard Mavis do in her career actually. \\"Jesus Wept\\",\\"What Are They Doing In Heaven Today\\" and \\"Sow Good Seeds\\" are lyrically in Mavis's traditional and almost pantheistic religiously observational style-yet with plenty of that gospel righteousness standing in contrast to the spare country/blues arrangements.<br /><br />  After the thoughtful country flavored \\"Far Celestial Shores\\" there's the excellent \\"I Like The Things About Me\\",an excellent Memphis styled deep funk/soul take on a lyric focusing on a modern day take on the self respect and positive self image,again very much in tune with Mavis's salad days. \\"Wake Up One Morning (With My Mind On Jesus)\\" is a stomping gospel/acoustic funk number in the finest tent show tradition whereas the title song is right out of the early Staple Singers' folk/soul gospel style. As with all of the tracks here there is one thing missing and my only strong complaint about this album-it focuses so much on the \\"naturalness\\" of the live instrumentation that important touches such as Pop Staples' styled reverbed guitar are not heard. To be this is the sound that bought out the most richness in Mavis's uniquely husky and broad ranged pipes. And while this album is meant to be felt as well ad heard,which it definitely is, its still one or two small yet significant touches away from a masterpiece. Mavis's voice represents vitality of human spirituality. And my own wish was that her music with Tweedy would express that a bit more than it does instrumentally.elf respect and positive self image,again very much in tune with Mavis's salad days. \\"Wake Up One Morning (With My Mind On Jesus)\\" is a stomping gospel/acoustic funk number in the finest tent show tradition whereas the title song is right out of the early Staple Singers' folk/soul gospel style.

1594746168|3.0|The Resurrectionist falls into the \\"insert into history\\" category of books, which I usually love. At first I found the style interesting with the first half of the book being basically a faux Biography of a medical doctor interested in the abnormalities of life. At first he is a well respected doctor making a name for himself, but as he focuses his work on evolution and possibly permutations and mutations of the human and other life forms his life leads him to something of a more unsavory path. The trouble is the biography section comes quite dry, which had me set it down far more often than I normally would. The second half of the book is made up of Dr. Spencer's gorgeously rendered anatomical studies of various mythological creatures, which is wonderful to peruse along with the doctor's notes.  So the book is worth picking up for the art alone, but I felt as if the biography section could have been done in a more entertaining fashion though it might have lost the feel the author was hoping to attain.<br /><br />If you're a fan of grotesqueries and oddities of the medical kind there is plenty to love here. Though I still prefer Vandermeer's work with the Thackery T. Lambshead's book which is in a similar vein.
B004Q9SO0O|5.0|Nice selection, each disc comes in a mini-LP sleeve, just like the original ones. Some recordings are from remastered sources, although its not written.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Since the first book, I've been rooting for Eva and Gideon- two tortured souls who have found solace in their unconditional love- they deserve their justice; their happy ending.  However, after waiting months to read the third installment, I was very disappointed with the direction of the book.  I'm glad there's more to their lives, but I won't wait in anticipation.  I've imagined my own ending.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|Very nice collection, specially for the price. If you have a lagre classic collection you should see whats inside first, otherwise go for it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my favorite room escape game by far.  clever but not impossible, very easy to play. can't wait for more levels!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Should be read. This information should and will scare you. Eating healthy just changed its meaning. Read this book now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great way to kill some time and to think of different ways to solve the challenge.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Pretty good game compared to most of the other $lendy game and a good game over all the graphics r pretty good to....I recommend to any $lendy fans and if u need/want a pretty good scare
B0031RS7X6|5.0|This was a great easy read. It was easy to relate to the characters. It had a great flow and was quite funny.<br />Very enjoyable
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun so far. Hopefully it gets tougher. I love escape games and finding new ways to escape.. So far too easy and predictable.
B008B0UIVW|5.0|If you love some good chicklit you will love this book. It was a fun read, very enjoyable. I couldn't put this one down.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Love all the actors and the story line is great - being from Michigan and the story is about a group of graduates from the UofM - make you wonder if people ever really stay in-touch
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive! I love it! Dont listen to the bad reveiws and like get this game now!!!!!!!!!!!
B0036UMM84|5.0|This is a GREAT LOVE story - almost as good as The Way We Were - makes you cry just not as much.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is an overall funny flick. I bought this for my wife as she loves it and I have to say it is funny. Betty White is a crack up and is great in this flick. For those that like a cross between chick flick and comedy this is one to watch.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed reading the journey of Victoria from her troubled childhood through the child welfare system. It was realistic and often sad. The flowers added beauty to a story that could have been emotionally heart-breaking. I loved the strength and tenacity of Elizabeth and her capacity to love.
B002436WFI|5.0|This movie is brilliant! The world of Terry Pratchett comes to life in this movie. The story is brilliant and well acted. You really get excited to see what's going to happen with all the characters. The costumes are wonderful. (I really want to make a Red Wizard hat and robes.)<br />I would recommend this movie for all ages and a great family tradition to start.<br />Now onto reading all these books! :)
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Of the three MIB's MIB3 is the best. The entire story of Agent Jay and Kay unfolds with James Brolin playing a young Agent Kay, which He was spot on with voice and mannerisms. A great movie which explains the relationship between the agents.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Even the songs that are okay I love. I'm a big BN fan, so anything I say would be biased.<br />I love the new Russian folk songs. They make me want to finish my gypsy costume even more and faster.<br />I love the album very much! But I love all their albums! :)
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a timeless musical, a must to have in any ones music collection of videos. Victor Hugo's words still ring true today for oppressed people under tyrannical leadership, who think of themselves and their wealth over the good of the people. The words of the music echo his wrenching words and pull on the heart strings of the listener. The turmoil of inner conflict in all people to do what is right or what they think is right.<br />Truly Les Mis'erables  will go down as the Greatest Musical Ever Conceived, Marius tears at your heart as sings Empty Chairs and Empty Tables, his remorse at those he lost on the barricade that day. The entire cast did their very best I feel to bring the Stage Play to the Screen, because I have seen the stage play and for those who haven't this is the next best thing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel indeed requires a 5 star rating. The book would pose interesting to all, but I mostly believe it is tailored for teens to young adults. If you're reading this review your interest will be satisfied if you simply begin to flip the pages. LOVELY AND SPECTACULARLY CRAFTED!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I personally didn't enjoy it at all it was so slow from the beginning to me. I am that type of person who reads the book before watching the movie, but in this case forget the book and watch the movie you will be by far more entertained.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using this nice big calculator on my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34;.  It's simple and straight forward, and works!  I recommend it as a basic calculator.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's not that bad people!<br />I posted it is awesome<br />Because it doesn't matter what you need..it's what the games like . So  I think that it's not that bad
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Love this CD! It's a good buy. His voice is soothing to the soul, and great to wake up to in the mornings and fall asleep at nights. I just can't get enough of his voice!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like how the game has different kinds of country's for a game and how there are tons of different characters
B00985E3UG|5.0|It was loaded with interesting  and little known facts about how the food industry in this country uses science and research to keep people buying and eating more. Can't recommend it enough. Another benefit from reading it is I automatically moved away from processed foods to healthier food. A real eye opener.
0143119680|2.0|If you like foodie blogs, your fantasy relationship is as a sub to a dom vampire, and your knowledge of verbs doesn't go past \\"Breathed\\" and \\"Purred\\" you might like this book.  The author used approximately 597 of the 600 odd pages to explain in great detail every single thing the protagonist and her extended family ate, drank, and wore.  The protagonist also exercises and sleeps a lot, and makes out with a vampire.  That's pretty much the extent of this book, which is actually the first in a series, which is made clear by the complete lack of plot development until about the final 2 pages.  You get to watch them make tea, drink whiskey, make dinner, do the dishes, take a nap, sweep the floors..........(snooze).<br /><br />While these things are pretty mind numbingly boring, the real problem with this book is that the utterly dull, but supposedly uber intelligent and spunky protagonist allows the vampire to completely take over her life, literally picking her up and carrying her around and ordering her every move, including when to eat, sleep and drink (like I said before, 99% of the book).  Hint to the author - constantly having the protagonist referred to as \\"independent\\" does not make her so, when she obviously has no will of her own.  One of the gag-inducing quotes of the book was when the protagonist and the vampire were having this deep conversation about the history of magic and the woman thinks \\"We are having these ground breaking revelations and all I can think about is 'Does he like his dinner?\\"  Vomitastic.<br /><br />I've only returned one other book to Audible (The Passage) due to complete and utter distaste for it, but I will be returning this one, and also returning the sequel which I'm not even going to bother with.  (To be fair, I did like this book better than The Passage.)<br /><br />I'm feeling lonely for Charlaine Harris' vampires and Sookie - who, although I'm not a huge fan of the books, at least have spunk, charm, and wit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i have played tons of these games and this is the best yet! I cannot wait until they get more levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just as good and engrossing and surprising as the previous seasons 1 and 2. Another great cliff hanging ending. Can't wait for season 4.
0316066524|5.0|Infinite Jest is an absolutely hilarious book filled with lucid descriptions of drug addiction, jokes within jokes, and a huge cast of characters, each with a unique perspective and diction.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I liked the application subway surfers.<br />There are many reasons I like this application.<br />But there is not much room.
1781162646|4.0|Book captured the flavor of the carnival quite well. Character development good.<br />The story did not have the sharp-edged suspense I expect from King.
0762445262|4.0|bought it for my dad as a novelty gift. he likes it, i like it. i expected the light to be stronger, like a small flashlight, but it is very dim<br />not the end of the world as the insignia is still visible, just not very vibrant.

B00338QENI|3.0|As a southern born and raised A. A. lady, life was not this way in  the 50' and 60's. Especially the relationship show between whites and blacks.  Even though based on true facts it was not well written nor told .
B005LAII80|5.0|If you like action/scifi, do not miss this movie!<br /><br />Just to give you an idea - I hate Sony.  I avoid their products like the plague.  Sony was the main driving force behind Bluray.  This is the one & only Bluray I've ever purchased (well, I bought two - one for me & one for dad).  This is the only movie I wanted to support badly enough to break my Sony-hating vow!
B00C25TCZ0|3.0|Let's address the issue right up front.  It is impossible not to conclude that Ricky Warwick is trying just a little too hard to sound like Phil.  But there really is no escaping the fact that he nails it.  And after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I reckon it's a pretty strong album and would have done the earlier line ups proud. The guitar sound is just fine and I quite like most of the songs.  I reckon it is a strong three and a half star album, but unfortunately you can't give it that score.  I like it, but every now and then I can't help wincing just a little at some of the pronunciations. I really don't mean to put the album down, I actually like it, but like I say, he's trying a tad too hard.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book because it has motivated me again. I was stuck in an rut, but this has gotten me out of it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was looking for something to read after the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; trilogy & a friend reccommended &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; trilogy. I bought the Kindle version & once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I am now reading the second book &#34;The Scorch Trails&#34; & the second book picks up where the first one left off. I would highly reccomend it!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I had no idea, just how much Tate had dragged down the band, and made Queensryche his own personal playground, until thankfully, he was banished from the band.  It is very difficult to say, having been one of his biggest admirers and thought he was what Queensryche was all about.  But, it has become apparent, since his deletion from the band, he was not what was best for the direction and future of Queensryche.<br /><br />Enter...Todd LaTorre.....<br /><br />After listening to this cd many, many, many times already, sufficed to say, Queensryche now has the ultimate 'Redemption'.<br /><br />Never have i been more proud of this band, and proud to display my Triryche tattoo.  This cd is a return to their roots, and shows that even without DeGarmo or Tate, this group can still put out an incredible product.<br /><br />I won't go over a song by song breakdown, but the whole cd is impressive.  Eerily reminiscent of Rage for Order / Mindcrime / Empire and Promised Land, this cd offers a little of everything.  What's truly evident, is the cohesion of the band, and they are ALL contributing.  Be it Parker, LaTorre, Ed Bass, Wilton and Rockenfeld, they all deserve a ton of credit.<br /><br />LaTorre is the perfect replacement for Tate.  He has VERY big shoes to fill...Tate a legend in his time (and in his own mind...IM GEOFF TATE DAMMIT!!!), had one of the best voices ever.  LaTorre while sounding similar to Tate in his prime, brings his own unique style to the band, and matches what they are doing, perfectly.<br /><br />The songwriting is impressive, and just the overall feel of the cd renews faith in this amazing band.<br /><br />I thank LaTorre from the bottom of my heart, for joining the band, and renewing the energy, the legacy of Ryche, and bringing an incredible cd to Ryche's adoring and worshipping fan base.  Again, big shoes to fill, and he has done an admirable job and then some.  Beyond the voice, he has the personality to match.. he genuinely appreciates the fans,shows his respect... on the other hand, Tate has proven the last year, how classless he is, and goes as far as tossing his fans cellphones and talking about his genitals.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Queensryche's previous works up to Promised Land...get this cd... you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you Ed, Scott, Todd, Parker and Michael, for making us all VERY proud to be fans of Queensryche again.  Love the cd!

B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Bought this as a total spur-of-the-moment purchase and I am still transfixed.  Cecile McLorin Salvant has the makings of a legendary jazz singer,  She's reminiscent of Sarah Vaughan and Betty Carter - but she also stands on her own.  This album is a trip - and a \\"must-have\\" for any jazz fan this season.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just had to have it and now I am glad I do, it is just wonderful experience to listen too!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved Bared to You and Reflected in You. Entwined was pretty much a retelling of them with little build up for a fourth book. Surprise!! This trilogy will have four (or more) books. Probably the only way the author could seperate it from Fifty Shades. The end was clumsy, and made me feel like there was no reason to read the next one. The sex wasn't nearly as good and certain scenes felt like they were stolen right out of Fifty Shades. I actually liked Bared & Reflected better than all of the Fifty Shades books. Just one more thing in common for the authors to drop the ball in book three. Maybe they should consider giving the authors more time to write instead of rushing out crap. I'd rather wait for a good read.
B000002AGN|5.0|THis is one of my favorite CD's, and when I ruin it by playing it over and over, I'll buy another!  THis is a great way to ease into jazz music.  Brubeck is both melodic and inventive with tempos that challenge and delight.
B007R108WA|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies! Ranks right up there with the Reckoning. Historical, atmospheric, deviling into the human psyche and why we do what we do. If you want something different take a look at this one I think it will hook you too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game... not to hard but keeps you playing .. needs more levels.. more levels more levels more levels. that's it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is probably the best game I have ever played and there adventure in every game you play different and harder
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I highly recommend Downton Abbey to friends.  It is well done, keeps my interest, and I love books and movies regarding this time period.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|This was an absolutely horrible movie and nothing like we were expected. The worse part about this, it cost more money to rent than most other movies.<br />Pros:<br />-None<br />Cons:<br />-Everything<br />I was not sure if Bruce was supposed to have Alzheimer’s or not, but he was not on his game. Several times he acting like he had no clue on what was going on around him and would make ridicules comments (punch lines, phrases, whatever you want to call them)<br />My wife and I were very disappointed in this movie, wanted to shut it off several times and compare all to this one. Such as “Was not as bad A Good Day to Die Hard, or he it cannot be as bad as the recent Die Hard”..<br />My recommendations, stay away from it and if you do want to watch it, don’t pay too much to view. Better yet, wait until it is on TV for free.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read, keeps you going! I would defiantly read again if I ran out of new books. The ending just kinda drops you. Can't wait for another one!!
1781162646|5.0|I picked this up at the airport terminal and yoked through nearly the whole thing on one 5 hour flight. It's not The Talisman, but I found myself thinking a whole lot about those characters. Maybe because it has that same magical things are not always what they seem, all the world is a stage and people at the cross-roads kind of feel. I'm a life long fan of everything and anything Stephen Kind writes in large part because while it is most likely true that I'll never meet my twinner, form my own ka-tet or go back in time and be 21 again with the wind at my back and world at my feet, Mr. King is quite capable of tapping into the well anytime he likes and bringing me with him all the same.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First off, I feel like there are a lot of positives and a few negatives about these books. Yes, the book was supposed to be three books, but the more we get of these characters the better in my opinion. Yes, some of the places that this plot is going are a bit strange right now (Megumi, Brett, Cary, Corrine, etc) but we also don't know where they're going to lead in the books to come.<br />I honestly felt that this book was the best in the series for a few reasons. One of the major issues I had with the last 2 books was that I felt Eva and Gideon would fight and be moody over absolutely nothing every two seconds and, frankly, I got bored of it. If it wasn't sex, it was arguing. This book had a much more realistic take on a relationship and the actual story line was much more enjoyable because of it. Another thing I really liked was that the sex scenes were more original than others in previous books. Not to compare the two, although it's really easy to do so, but in Fifty Shades I found myself getting tired of those scenes because of the repetitive nature of them. Even the first two books in this series got a bit old but this book got it just right. This book developed Eva and Gideon better than any of the others and it left the series open to go to a lot of different places. As a person who reads pretty much all day, everyday, I was impressed with the direction this book took compared to the last two.
B006GLM5EQ|3.0|The series is not very true to the books. Sookie's brother on True Blood is so unlikeable but in the books he's okay. There isn't an exorcism, either, which was weird and unnecessary. True Blood looks kind of like 90's trailer trash was cast on a show; whereas the book characters were a little more complex.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton has written another outstanding story.  Kept me interested through the entire book.  She writes a great mystery.  I always love reading her novels.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I would not be without one ever again. It is perfect for all of the little crumbs in the kitchen!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I is the coolest most awesome amazing game I have played ever in my whole life e very one should play it.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|Watch looks great. Chronograph mechanism feels a little stiff and sometimes requires stronger push.<br />Strap is a total waste.<br /><br />For some reason it also does not feel very comfortable on my hand.
B001S6Y0AQ|2.0|The beginning of the CD has a very bad sound, as if there was an error in the recording. I will never buy another CD from Amazon without an explanation. I have the Time Out album and a CD of Time Out, and they are perfect renditions.<br />I did love the DVD of Dave Brubeck explaining how he came up with the tunes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Must be one of the best games I ever played. Love it so addicting. Just one of those games you could play for hours nonstop.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was looking for something to read after 50 Shades of Gray and throughly enjoyed this read. In fact I believe it may be better written. Regardless... LOVED THIS BOOK!! THANKS!
B0062QRTKA|4.0|I was raised a United Methodist and this is so not offensive. It's a FAMILY game so it making this tale a bit less fire and brimstone is not a negative. People need to get the stick out of their rears and not give a game negative ratings because they are offended by a freaking cellphone game. Grow up or shut it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoy the crossfire novels. Sylvia Day is an amazing writer. she somehow manages not to repeat descriptive phrases and is able to express express herself in different ways even when discussing the same repetive topic (i.e., the multiple, steamy sex scenes). My main complaint with this particular book is that I was expecting an ending and instead was provided with what I felt was a teaser/sample novel that didn't have all that much excitement. It is a book that exists only to setup for the next book and leave you hanging and dissatisfied. I really wish Sylvia simply extended the length of this book and finished it. I'm sure the next one will be worth reading  but I almost feel like you could potentially read book 1, 2, and then book 4 and not miss much.
B00695A6RW|5.0|This is not a children's movie. Bad people are bad, and the most you can hope for is a cessation of their bad acts, and not some predictable Hollywood redemption of their soul. Peter Mullen is, as usual, fabulous at portraying a down-and-out man on the edge of society. The only weakness in the script is how seldom the 'F' word is used. The movie should open with a full-screen shot of the '18+' icon, while Peter Mullen says the 'F' word repeatedly for 60 seconds uninterrupted, just to encourage the crybabies and idiots from Texas to turn off their TeeVees. If your world is all sunshine and lollipops, and your feelings are hurt by mean people and bad language, this film is not for you, and you should download a nice Hollywood rom-com to entertain you until your next trip to the big blue Big-box store to buy sheep chow.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played several of this type of game. I have to say that the story line with flashbacks was definitely one of my raves so far.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its an awsome game but can you please come up with 0.8.0 with enchanting tables and  caves. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!, and if you do then thank you thank you
B00CTT9646|4.0|I watched the original series as a child when it aired on TV in the 60's, then again as a teen when it was eternally re-played on regular TV in the 70's. I love Star Trek and can recite many of the lines (but no role play or Spock ears, lol). Having said that, I was very afraid. I think the original ST2-TWoK  was the best trek movie ever and it has a special place in my heart. When I found out the \\"new\\" villian was Kahn I figured I would hate this movie even more than I hated the 1st remake with this new crew (don't ask about Star Trek by JJ Abrahms #1).<br />I am so glad I went and saw this anyway (I figured the 3D would at least be interesting)! It remains gently respectful of the original series with tons of homages, if you catch them, without desecrating the old series. The characters feel more like the original crew, thank God, instead of the clowns in the first movie. It uses a trick to stay true to the time line, allowing the 2nd match of Kirk and Kahn to be possible (I don't want to spoil it).<br />I am looking forward to buying and watching this movie again. I think you will enjoy it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Excellent program for the apocalyptic / sci fi lover. Great drama for those who prefer that. Either way, the story is thrilling and will not disappoint.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game because it is challenging and fun and it doesn't have interruptions in the game such as advertising videos and pics
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just a great book. Kept me on edge. Easy read. Leaves the reader wanting more. Could barely put it down.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a fun but hard realistic plot.You can figure out the ending at the start and is unrealistic as plot is you will get a kick out of reading it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Thank you for all of your assistance in replacing my Kindle charging cord due to all of its protective coating flaking off while sitting in a drawer! After being told by the first Customer Service Rep that replacing it was my problem and I would have to bear the cost ( it was a birthday gift, I had never actually read a book on it yet, and the drawer it sat in was never in the sunlight or in any way the problem) a second Customer Service Rep felt I had been treated shabbily and stepped up to set up a credit on my account that covered the actual cost of the cord. And she was very kind while doing so; then having free shipping added on top of that made the process smooth over everything!<br />Thank you - now I can actually use my Kindle.<br />Shawnet Healy, MS STC
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this entire series I can not wait for another book to come out.<br />Sylvia love the taste in men you have :)
0679809015|5.0|My son likes very few books, but he does like this one.  We had another chunky flap book he liked so I needed to get another one.  Great to throw in the diaper bag or have in the car as it is nice and small for travel.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|This was a great sequel, we found it funny from beginning to end. I would for sure recommend this movie to a friend.
B005CDTOCU|4.0|Liked it a lot & passed it on to an individual who would also appreciate it.  This concept  food for thought.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|We love this movie!  It is so nice to own it, and have it available whenever we want it, without having to locate it in the cabinet.
B005HSL626|5.0|I just got the new update for fruit ninjas and when I went on it to play I looked at how many new blades and backrounds ther're were and the only blades I had left were the first three on the list and the original background.  the only blade I was missing before I updated was the shadow blade and I had all backrounds.  could have just been a glitches but still really disipointed.  :(
B00CWVGS10|3.0|This movie is a nice love story.  It's a bit over the top in contrasting life styles among the families in the town, it is set in.
B0000X61UU|5.0|great workout! I actually already had this video and just ordered another via amazon. Radu is great! whoever the clowns are that say his workouts are too tough and dangerous are most likely just lazy and too out of shape to actually do them. But thats the stuff that works, not those newer workouts where you are constantly reminded every 5 min. to take a break if needed, heck if you have to take a break so much you may as well give it up and just take a nap instead.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This is a great sci fi flick.  It is very entertaining.  We had to watch it a few times in order to completely understand everything that was happening.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Once weI started watching Downton Abbey we couldn't stop until we watched all episodes.  Great show and anxious for season 4 to begin.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Bared to You and Reflected in You were amazing. I guess I just expected the same suspense and excitement from Entwined with You. I have read at least 7 of Sylvia Day's books and she is extremely talented. I enjoy reading her books very much. I hope this Is not the end of the Crossfire Novels.
B001TW69J4|2.0|Nothing likeable for me & No Singing..just music but the problem for me is the music itself. It's just a jumbled mess...short lived rythms then onto somekind of infused mixture of progressive noise. I found Chimp Spanner more enjoyable than this and Chimp Spanner (in limited quantities) is slightly above the border line for me..<br /> For me I listened to this a few times but could never get anything out of it other than a few good rythms here and there. I made the mistake of reading the fact that one of the guys from Periphery helped write some of this so I bought both Cd's at the time. Well now both Cd's sit in the pyle of Cd's that I will never listen to again.<br /> I do like Periphery..Tesseract...SkyHarbor..Mnemic older Fear Factory..Underoath..Threat Signal...but this CD just did nothing for me.
0802473156|5.0|This book really helped me understand people in general. I am not married so I didn't read this book to help me with that. I read this book to help me understand people and why certain people work well together. I strongly recommend that EVERYONE read this book!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Very disappointing. After a long wait for this book I was very unhappy with the short read & ending, as were a lot of my friends
0486474917|5.0|I admit to being a fan of the great detective Sherlock Holmes.  I had read several of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books on Sherlock Holmes and this one (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)is one of the very best.  What makes this volume so appealing is that it has twelve wonderful short stories. Several of these stories are the best-known cases Sherlock Holmes and his loyal friend Dr. Watson has investigated. I just love the way Holmes always seems to amaze Dr. Watson with his excellent attention to detail, which is a skill all good detectives must develop if they are to succeed in being a good investigator.<br /><br />This book is organized into twelve tales which include the following:  A scandal in Bohemia, The Red-headed League, A case of Identity, The Boscombe Valley mystery, The five orange pips, The man with the twisted lip, The blue carbuncle, The speckled band, The engineer's thumb, The noble bachelor, The beryl coronet and The copper beeches.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a Sherlock Holmes reader you will want to have your own copy of this book for your personal library. On the other hand, if you are a true fan you probably have already read this book.  However,  if you are not familiar with the great Sherlock Holmes and desire to learn why he is one of the most popular and well-known detectives in the world, pick up a copy of this wonderful text.  The twelve short stories will give you a sample of the legendary Sherlock Holmes method of solving mysteries. A great read.<br /><br />Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir)
0143039431|5.0|Not an easy read, but well worth it. I don't know how I missed this in high school. Loved every page.
055358202X|5.0|George R.R. Martin does it again, immersing the reader into his mythical realm of Westeros and beyond.  Expanding on the characters that have captivated readers and introducing new ones, the Game of Thrones has never been so full of plotting and intrigue.  In addition to exciting, bloody battles and endless scheming, A Feast of Crows explores social commentary, exploring the devastation of war and the effect on those caught in the middle of endless battles.  The common people who have little concern of who sits upon the Iron Throne are often the victims of aristocratic ambition and merciless outlaws.  Religion, which has always has been a strong theme throughout the epic is explored more deeply, illuminating how religious zeal shapes and motivates power grabs and politics.  Although in my opinion, A Feast of Crows is not the best book of the series, it captures the essence of what readers have come to love.
B004I744AS|2.0|Have only used it twice; seems okay. Tried to look up 'steampunk' and it gave me 'cyberpunk' - so one definition out of only two requests is not stellar.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|For those of you who don't know, Stephen Colbert is a hilarious fellow who runs his own political/comedy show, called \\"The Colbert Report\\" on Comedy Central. Among Colbert's more humorous quirks is an all-consuming, quite irrational fear of bears. He seems to believe they are out to get him at every opportunity, and that they may very well be bent on conquering the world itself. As such, he would probably soil his shorts by watching \\"Brave\\", as this movie is chock-full of bears... most of which are adorable, but some of which are quite scary.<br /><br />If you share Colbert's weird fear of bears, steer clear of \\"Brave\\", for it will undoubtedly give you night terrors for a solid fortnight. Personally, I think bears are awesome, and Pixar's rendering of them in this beautifully animated movie is nothing short of breathtaking. The other elements of animation are likewise up to the studio's industry-leading standards, and this movie is just as visually impressive as anything else in their formidable stable. These guys can create vibrant, immersing worlds like nobody else.<br /><br />The story, while somewhat simplistic, is also great. At first, I was a bit hesitant as the plot began to unfurl, as I feel that the \\"angst-ridden teenager whom nobody understands\\" theme has been ridden to death, and I couldn't believe that Pixar would go down that road. However, I was happy to see that the movie soon took on unexpected twists and turns, and delivers an exciting, heart warming tale that even Stephen Colbert would enjoy (should he be able to look past the scary bears). \\"Brave\\" is highly recommended for viewers of all ages, and makes for a great movie for parents to share with their lil' ones.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game! You can do so much with your horse, definitely a game for horse lovers, you can train your horse nd compete in competitions , I recommend this game

B00005K3OT|4.0|This film depicts a woman who specializes in making candy that is filled with a &#34;love potion.&#34;  It seems everyone who eats it develops a change in attitude.<br />They develop a loving attitude.  However, not everyone appreciates what this candy does -- so the woman eventually needs to close her shop and move it elsewhere.  It's fun, but not realistic.
1781162646|5.0|This book really exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a wonderful, heartwarming and riveting story. The book fits the current summer atmosphere and is a great read to bring to the beach.
B0001WTWCO|3.0|This is an interesting film.  However, it is sad.  I purchased it because it was mentioned on a Seinfeld episode and had to know why some people cried and others hated it.  I decided it was okay, but it is long, and I didn't have the patience or endurance to watch it to the end.  I saved it to watch the ending the later.  So, it's okay, but I was not captivated by it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had it all. Sex, drama, action it's a book for all adults I've read the series two times.
160774273X|5.0|Works just like it says it does.  Best sourdough I have ever made. I cook on the bbq and use my cast iron dutch oven to get the results.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It's official: I am infected with this game. It is both diabolical and fun at the same time, and keeps me coming back with its difficulty. If there was a flaw, it would be how hard it is to actually win the game. Cure research speeds along despite anything you may do. (In reality, cures take years for bacteria and human kind has never cured a virus once it takes a human host.) Anyway, it is fun to play and I would recommend it for anyone wanting a challenge. Surprisingly, this game appeals to many people, including my mother, which threw me for a loop. I personally don't enjoy it for the oh-my-gosh-I-get-to-kill-the-world feeling as much as the fun of trying new variables  and strategies. Kudos to Ndemic, this one was worth it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|FINALLY.....a strategy puzzle that is worthy of a pedestal. Excellent graphics and game play on my Kindle Fire. A lot more money has been spent on software that doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same genre.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My 18 month old is loves the water. After reading the current reviews, this seemed to be the best! And it sure is. The blow up toys are a great addition, the coral ring toss and turtle with balls inside. My daughter loves the fountains that streams out from the sides and the fish designs inside. \\"Whats that?\\" haha! So far, Plenty of fun and safe entertainment for the up coming hot days.<br />The only draw back is that the plug for the air doesn't seem very durable. Looks as if it will pop out any second. And the slide, it's good for now, but doesn't take much weight to make it collapse.<br />All in all, it's a must have, your lil ones will be happy!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|If your a fan or not of The Die Hard series,  this will be a worthy watch.  Definitely would recommend this to all.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|It is a light game, do not expect depth and years of strategic challenges, but when the right number of people are around a lunch table and wish to play something for 20 minutes or so, LL is hard to beat.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It keeps you thinking all the time some times it is so obvious and you cant see it it is fun
1451648537|5.0|I want more! There. I said it. I want to learn more of both Steve Jobs's life as well as the reflections of those whom he encountered. At six hundred pages (roughly), it read like a two hundred page book. There is simply far too much \\"stuff\\" to address. I suppose one of Jobs's hallmarks was to shed the unnecessary with his laser focus, but perhaps in doing so you shed of all nuances as well. I suppose what I am saying is that I don't want just the essence, I want the flavor and spice as well. Perhaps more people close to Steve Jobs--both professionally and personally--will write companion biographies.<br /><br />Maybe my interest in Steve Jobs's story is stronger than that which most people hold. Jobs was my contemporary. He attended one of my high school's rivals. I knew San Jose as it was transitioning from an orchard-based community to Silicon Valley. I went to Berkeley just a couple of years after Jobs and Woz sold their blue boxes there. Indeed, I remember as a freshman someone who came into the dorms and tried to sell me one. My first computer was a Lisa. I was a BMUG member and championed the cause of the Macintosh as an easy to use and therefore more economical (and productive) alternative to a PC. That drive and zeal contributed to enormous problems I encountered at work. (The Mac vs. PC wars were real and serious then--at least to PC users who were afraid; Mac users just wanted freedom and choice.)<br /><br />In a world of degrees of separation, one of my best friends in high school ended up being the garden/housekeepers at Jobs's estate. We remain friends. She hasn't yet read the book and seems to have a lot of emotions wrapped up in that phase of her life.<br /><br />I suppose what I appreciate most about this book is that it gives me pause to understand the ups and downs of life. The parallels and the tangents. The definitive and the murky. I am thankful that I never worked for Steve Jobs, based on all that I have read both in Isaacson's book and others, such as Any Hertzfeld's [[ASIN:1449316247 Revolution in The Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made]]. However, I share many of Jobs' philosophies (but not working styles) on the purpose or mission that organizations should hold. For example, I have always held that companies, organizations, and governments should always focus on producing great products and services, ignoring the financials, because the profits will flow if our souls are in the business. That must be one of the keys to real long-term success that is so at odds with today's \\"what are the next week's billings looking like?\\" mentality.<br /><br />Yes, the book is filled with hope and sadness, thrills and disgust, certainty and ambiguity. In short, it's about a set of extraordinary lives focussed primarily on one extraordinary life. Yes, you should read this book.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing: please don't mess up the movie too much!
B009H5IS1W|4.0|I felt like they kinda ran out of ideas but it was a good season. I'm glad they caught the replicator!!!
B008F9T76Q|4.0|I am currently hooked on teen dystopian books. I loved the Hunger Games,am currently reading book 3 of the Matched Series, eagerly awaiting book 3 of Divergent Series and look forward to book 2 of Maze Runner.  I rate MAZE RUNNER up there with Hunger Games and Divergent. Hopefully it will become a movie too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Solid read! Very engrossing, for a reader in her late 20s - I don't know how engaging it might be for my 6th grade students, but I am thinking about trying an excerpt with them.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I had read the book before I saw the movie, and maybe that is why I only gave it three stars.  While I understand that movies have to be &#34;flexible&#34;  with the story,  I feel they took too much &#34;liberty&#34; with the story line although the &#34;jest&#34; of the story was maintained.  I don't think it would have hurt to maintain some of the &#34;mystery&#34; in the book a little longer.  As it was they &#34;popped it out&#34; about 20 minutes into the movie.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|This book is full of good information.  I was a 2c who had been wearing my hair straight forever!  I actually thought I had straight hair because I would always wash, blow dry and then straighten, I never saw what it could do if left alone.  After having 2 young kids, I don't have time for that, and my stylist told me my hair was curly and showed me how to style it.  Then I found this book and my hair is so nice now.  Curly and wavy, and its getting healthier now that I am not washing and drying it to death.  It seems to be getting curlier and curlier as time goes on.<br />At first, I had a hard time going totally &#34;curly girl&#34; but over time I've even gotten used to not brushing or combing my hair.  my curls are soft and bouncy.  great book!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This is a love story pure and simple and of loosing confidence in yourself.  I'm not sure why we think &#34;old&#34; people can't have the same emotions as teenagers, but this is a gem of a movie.  Of course Dame Maggie Smith steals the show, but the supporting cast is equally as good,  mix that with REAL retired musicians and you have beautiful ensemble pieces.  Highly recommend!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wow, what a trip this book is! It isn't often that I find a book so captivating. One must read it in order to experience the life of Pi,literally. Pi's life was interesting even before his trip across the ocean. His experience on the ocean leaves lingering thought long after you've read this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very fun and challenging game. my 7 year old and I played together and I love how it made her think. I cannot wait for more rooms to be added. hurry!!!

B009VA1FN6|5.0|Wonderful writer. Loved the story but had to concentrate sometimes on the date-line, especially if it is a book I picked up and put down. Would be better read in long stretches, rather than in short bursts.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and it help to clear your stress. This game helps me through  depression and stress. I would totally recommend getting this game :D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is great, but you need to be able to earn gems easier. I want to get more horses, but I do not have enough gems to do so.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It has been awhile since I read Bared To You but I was able to go straight to this one and feel like I just finished the first book. Very good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is sick I love it me and my cousin play day and night you should totally get this if you hate it I hate u
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game unlike some other games actually requires some degree of Skill and this I find personally refreshing. And I absolutely the graphics
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed this story very much. Great read. Can't wait till the next one. Thank you Sylvia Day for writing these novel.<br />A must read if you enjoyed FSOG.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book five is better than book four, and really four wasn't bad. I loved this book! Now I will go into mourning while I wait for book six be completed.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a fun and great read!!!!! Great continuation of the love story, did think was the last book...the story continues.....
B008OOYALE|5.0|THIS IS A FUN GAME! I HAVE FUN BREEDING MY DRAGONS AND SEEING THE COOL EGGS I GET.THEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH DRAGON IT CAN BE! Love it!
1400069289|5.0|As always, I'm still reading while writing a review, and this is a great book. P. 61 in \\"Habit\\" is intriguing because it describes the efficiencies created when sports players are in the zone, with the most interesting part being that it sounds like Tony Dungy tries to place his entire team in the zone. What a concept, and what a way to raise the bar on a sport that already employs some of the best athletes on the planet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thought this was a really good game but it leaves you wanting more. I hope they come up with more room. Definitely worth it for apps. It keeps you busy and keeps your mind thinking.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I have the VHS of this, now that I'm converting my collection this one was a definite keeper.  DVD arrived quickly & in good shape.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Totally fun! It gets your mind thinking. Looking for clue exploring all the little things. Like it because its not super hard but not soft on ya either. Definitely recommended
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This movie makes me think of Dracula as a real love story, instead of all the horror many people think it is, my children had never seen this and now they know why I feel like I do about Dracula!
B007PVHANM|5.0|The only thing left out is what happened to all the money? Surely, it's been somewhat ugly, what with all the children and women he left behind with legitimate claims. Otherwise, this 2.5-hour film hits all the highlights, and benefits from legal access to recordings and concert footage. You see just how energetic a stage performer Marley was in his prime, which was his entire life, given that he died at only age 36. The music remains the genius, and we get plenty of it without dwelling exclusively on the recordings, which are still the best in all of reggae. If you don't know the story, and just think smoking ganja was what Marley was all about, then view this eye-opening movie.
B008G3N71W|2.0|I've enjoyed some erotic books, but found this one a bit odd.  First, I wish I had realized it was written in \\"English English\\" as opposed to American English.  There were times you needed a translator.<br />And the story got rather boring in the second half.  I would love to recommend it, but there ae better erotic books around.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is an awesome book in th series! The only problem I have with this series is that I read them too fast!!  Haha
B005PK1G76|5.0|Did exactly what it's supposed to do. Have me a place for 2 drinks and keys. Doesn't work really great for 32 oz and bigger fountain drinks but I would buy again
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|It was an okay game.I had some trouble getting some objects because they were set too close to the edge of the screen.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A nice way to relax at the end of the day. Fun and entertaining and its free. Not bothered by ads.
0812993292|1.0|This book was excruciating to read...so slow. We get it, he has blisters on his feet. The ending was beyond anticlimactic.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Some good hack and slash fun.  Good variety.  Plenty of character as well as equipment choices.  Nice graphics.  Assuming with ranged weapons is a bit funky
B008EQI72U|4.0|This may be worth a watch.  There are a couple of very unrealistic scenes but it work out well overall.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  A great theatrical follow up to an incredible scifi/western television series, that the executives over at Fox Televison, pulled the plug on, way too soon.  Brown Coats FOREVER!!!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Introducing DotPW to Android devices makes sense; the touch screen of my Kindle Fire HD makes interacting with a card game feel authentic, and Magic the Gathering is the type of rare, creative game that can envelop you for dozens of hours, if not hundreds.  What's more, the addition of a deck building mode was a coup, and a long-awaited addition to the series.  What keeps this game from receiving a 5-star review, however, is an unfortunate decision Wizards made concerning the replayability of this mode.  To describe the mode first:  they allow 2 separate playthroughs, each beginning with a handful of booster packs which the player opens to reveal the cards he/she will use to create a competitive deck.  The player then progresses through a campaign wherein he/she receives additional booster packs to refine it even further.  This process is very engaging and probably contains the most value in the entire game, especially for those who have played the previous titles and are accustomed to the single player campaign mode.  The problem lies with Wizards' choice to make a bit of extra money. In order to experience this immensely fun aspect of the title more than just twice, you have to pay $2.99 (or is it $1.99...  either way the point is the same) for each additional playthrough.  While an assortment of die-hard fans will certainly be willing to pay multiple times for a chance to field a competitive deck, a better way would have been to simply offer a single slot the player could erase and replay endlessly, with the option of saving a particularly good deck for the same price it now costs to purchase a new playthrough.  Like your deck?  Save it for a small price, and then go back to playing and replaying the sealed deck mode for hours on end.  If they had decided such, more people would spend money to save their potent decks, more people would play their game for longer, and ultimately the sealed deck mode would become the driving force of the franchise in the future.  Today's gamers want the opportunity to be endlessly creative, and while the excitement of the sealed deck mode offers them the chance, the money-grasping feel of their first rendition leaves it all tasting sour.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Instantly fell in love with the series.  Pity that the idiots over at Fox TV didn't realize what a gem they had with this series, and that no one else such as WB or UPN didn't have the good sense to pick it up.  Long live the Brown Coats
630463949X|5.0|All five underrated superstars.  One of their four chart peakers and a great one at that.  If you want to see them at their best see the 1997 DVD &#34;Fleetwood Mac - The Dance&#34;.  Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie.  Lindsey is showcased in an inspired acoustic number in &#34;The Dance&#34; which gives a brief glimpse into his talent as an underrated guitarist.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|very entertaining and addictive. each floor was a little more challenging which made it more fun. can't wait for next app to come out.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|The Sanus Clip is small size optimization and theoretical big music expansion capacity ramifications.  Look here-I think this thing is really small and neat-revolutionary product shrinkage/big capacity expansion.<br /><br />I didn't want to pony up the big bucks for the Apple I-Pod /Smartphone stuff so I picked this up for about $30 used on Amazon.  I put a 32GB microSD memory chip in it for <$20 and I was going to convert a bunch of CD music to MP3 and load it up for work or walking outside.  It is really smaller than a Hot-Wheel toy car and light, with the \\"clip\\" which allows you to stick it on the collar of a T-shirt or pants pocket.  It sounds really high quality with good headphones (i.e. my AKG Q-350's or Sennheiser PMX 680 sports headphones).<br /><br />The FM radio section would even work in the basement where I work and sounded pretty clear.  Cell phones don't even work in the basement at work.  It has a mic and recorder function for kids at school to record lectures - I think.  It uses a rechargeable battery with a USB adapter cord that plugs into a PC for recharging.  I figure it could definitely get me through my longest anticipated exercise period and probably about 3 hours of work (but I could plug it into the work PC for power and go the longest day). It could also plug into a car USB port and with a male-male 3.5mm cord aux-in to the car radio and it could go all day reading electronic books on a long trip.<br />The 8 GB on-board memory is supposed to carry about 2000 3.5 minute songs so with the 32 GB memory chip that would work out to about 10,000 3.5 minute songs total.  It would take about 72 eight-hour work days to convert enough CD music to MP3s to fill it up and that is about how much music it would hold for playback for less than $50.<br /><br />For an extra 5 or 6 memory chips at less than <$20 (i.e. $120) I could convert my 350 CD collection to MP3s and load them up in about 3,456 hours or 432 eight-hour work days total and that is about how much music it would hold for playback for about $120 additional money.  It would all fit in a T-shirt pocket.  Isn't that some kind of neat shit disturber for mini-bucks?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an entertaining and addictive app to buy. Definitely will keep you half the night! Highly recommended to anyone who wants to buy an an app that's worth its money, and you can play again and again without getting bored!
B000002KGT|5.0|All five underrated superstars.  One of their four chart peakers and a great one at that.  If you want to see them at their best see the 1997 DVD &#34;Fleetwood Mac - The Dance&#34;.  Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie.
B00005K3LW|3.0|not bad, but pretty good!! I was expecting it 2 be a better movie and I can't wait to get the other Die Hard's
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Cannot wait until Book 4 comes out.  Very good continuance of the characters.  Very sensual and thrilling.  Fantastic.<br />Enjoyed thoroughly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and intriguing. It provides a wide range of interesting puzzles to solve. I highly recommend getting this great app.
1936891026|5.0|There was a catagory in a magazine I was browsing titled &#34;Books that changed your life&#34; a reader listed &#34; The War of Art&#34; as one that changed her life.  After reading, I understand.  I enjoyed the author's version of a demon I battle every day.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|The soundtrack is rather repetitive. It sounds like variations of the same song. The main title is super and takes up the challenge of replacing the classic Superman theme song.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm so sad this is over. It's a wonderful book and I couldn't put it down! If you read the first one you definitely have to read them all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It's just like  the real world. I love how you can get different types of horses.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|this is a movie that I have watched so many times, I know the scenes and the words by heart. not kid friendly though, so limited on when I can watch it, but I do every chance I get.
B008EQGKII|5.0|This is true of all the Shuttle units I've owned over the years - I wish they did a better job with cooling. I ran prime95 with an Intel 3770S prcoessor in this box, and monitored it with Open Hardware Monitor - CPU temps cracked 100C. Idles at around 40C. It'd be nice if the cooling solution was a touch more aggressive, but, overall, I can't complain. Small paackage, tons of power.<br /><br />Uses SODIMM's - laptop memory for the uninitiated. Also uses laptop-sized HDD's - so, basically you get a laptop with a non-laptop CPU. Already said it - tons of power under the hood.<br /><br />Seems to be the only ITX-format board, let alone \\"barebones\\" that can hang with 16GB of RAM. 2 NICS. Oddly, 2 serial ports. DVI, HDMI, and audio out. USB 2.0 and 3.0.<br /><br />All this says to me, cheap (to purchase), tiny server. The 2nd NIC does that basically. Has a a mini PCIx slot inside too that could handlea WiFi card, for yet another network interface. Win-Win-Win.<br /><br />Overall, pretty happy with this box. Did I mention it's tiny? It's also quiet, even though it has dual fans, I've never really heard it spin up - but, I have it in a closet sitting on top a Synology DS. That's where the real magic of this box can get leveraged. Runs Windows Server 2012 without added drivers just fine, so it should do fine with Windows 8 without adding drivers. Also runs Hyper-V just fine (the real reason for this box - ha!) - w/ 16GB of RAM...it can host a few VM's :D<br /><br />Only thing I wish it had was the abolity to do RAID1, even if it's Fake Raid (intel chipset based) - then I could pop in a 2nd HDD. Looks like it's almost big enough that one could stick a WD Raptor drive in there - removed from it's carrier (bare drive is a 2.5\\", but it's about half-again as tall as standard laptop drives. Might fit....<br /><br />Disappointed there's no blank to cover the CD Drive - the flip up drive bay cover is all that's there.<br /><br />Update: I discovered why it doesn't cool all that well - the fans that operate with the heatpipe are monitored/managed by the system board temp, not the CPU temp. This presents the obvious issue of where the CPU will get blazing hot if they system is in a cold room. Really bad design decision, but, I figure this could be modified with an extension cable, as there is a CPU fan lead that would fit, just the cabling is too short. Also don't know if the system would post without something connected to the system fan header. I'll figure it out someday....but just a heads-up for anyone purchasing this - this is with bios version .105...could have been a recent change or might be fixed later.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I am what some people call a TV addict but lately, TV has lost it's edge with too many reality shows and just bad sitcoms. I am also a BIG superhero person which some think is strange being I'm over fifty and female. I just knew I would be disappointed when Arrow aired but BOY WAS I WRONG, this is such a great show and it doesn't hurt that it's star Stephen Amell is super HOT. This show is so good that my husband (who isn't into these type of shows) and my eighty plus year old mother is also watching. It is a rule that no one calls me (except my mother during commercials) until the show is over unless there is an emergency. The September 17th DVD date is perfect since my birthday is the week after and I told my family this is what I want for my birthday. I can't wait for my gift and the October 9th second season date.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the mind games and the puzzles are great too! We need more of these, well worth the pay! Can't wait for the next installment!!!
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Its good time movie when you want to just 'feel good&#34;, romance, action and of course Tom Cruise at his best!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This show has some great lines. Thinking about watching it again. Listen carefully. All characters are in the act. You will definitely miss something if you take a snack break.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|If you like any of the match three type games,  then you will definitely enjoy this one. Not only do you have the puzzle matching part, but you are building a city too. Plus you get bonuses for achieving certain tasks. Very addicting.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This has to be my favorite DC animated movie released up until now. This movie flows really well and the attention to detail is fantastic. If you are  batman fan, I would highly recommend this film.
0385344333|4.0|I have liked Lee Child's writing style and the Jack Reacher character. I always know that he will accomplish what ever he needs to do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough to keep you interested.  Installed onto Asus Transformer tablet with Android with no problems.  First time I've played a puzzle game like this and I'll definitely be looking for more.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Wow, Love westerns and this takes it to a level possibly beyond even tombstone.  Very intense, engaging, realistic, and violent.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I was a bit concerned about the whole humanized thing, but after seeing it a couple weeks ago, I love it. Personalities are intact, lots of easter eggs, and fun, if different and pop-y, music. The story is not a masterpiece of its ilk, but it works just fine. There are a few little hitches here and there, but I left that theater very happy that I made the effort to go see Equestria Girls.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I am a older follower of 1D but figure since i missed out on the Beatles, if the 1D band create the same type of hype I don't want to be one of the ones who was unsupportive and disinterested.  Keep up the hard work 1D.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I would absolutely pay for this app - and others these developers create. Its fun and each level gets more challenging, but not lengthy. Humorous and enjoyable! Another addictive app that is worth my time!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Well ok, I'm young at heart but it is well writtemn, it has great plots and I love the characters. I just inhale the three books and can't wait for the sequel.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Gets more challenging as you play - humorous and addictive! I didn't realize how addictive until I glanced at the clock and realized I had been playing it for quite awhile. A lot of fun!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Well ok, I'm young at heart but it is well writtemn, it has great plots and I love the characters. I just inhale the three books and can't wait for the sequel.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|This novel offers a sensitive insight into the troubled minds of it's main characters. The writing draws you in and holds you entralled as you wind you way through the convoluted rational of a troubled mind.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Well done story of intrigue, double dealing, disloyalty, and guts.  Jack Reacher goes over the line because law enforcement won't and the military cant
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Love the book. Beautiful story of acceptance<br />How we are more than the outside and we have to deal with it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the game once I figured out how how to play. the instructions were not helpful at all. I wish there were more levels or the game randomly switched where things were hiding so I can play levels over again.
B008MM9630|5.0|Cute game it seems cool so far. I just started playing it tonight. I love fairies!!  The animals look cool but too expensive.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was entertaining. I enjoyed it enough to want to read the next one. But I feel it could have had a little more content in it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love this site! I have never seen soooo many different ideas in one place at one time! Keep up the good work!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|That was was used alot in this game.  I enjoyed seeing how much power and dexterity I had in the finger.
B000YAA68C|5.0|That is one of my fav movie I love it so muvh thank you for this movie on amazon thanks
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I had a hard time getting beyond the enormous amount of cigarette smoking that was in the movie.  I had to stop it not too far from the beginning.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|This movie was a great gag gift which turned out the person really loved it great present this movie made
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought that it was really fun and easy to use. A good app for when you have some time to kill.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|When will the final crossfire novel out--------Please let me know----I really enjoyed reading these crossfire novels----I really like have an endings-----
0618526412|4.0|This book which minutely examines life in the South during the 1940's explains a lot.  Racial prejudice, ignorance of differences in others, and the slow, sometimes hard process of growing up in that time are portrayed through the characters of a young girl, a deaf man, a Black doctor, a kindhearted cafe owner, and a opinionated vagabond.  Each character brings his or her own set of values, problems, hopes and dreams.  Each character affects the other many times in ways they would never know.  This is a portrait of people who live small lives in a relatively small town, but whose lives are nonetheless filled with anxiety, fear, love, loneliness, and hopefulness.<br /><br />This is a book that introduces us to characters, not plot.  But those characters are memorable, believable, and regardless of what our own positions in life may be, we can find a bit of ourselves in each one.  (I read this during the height of the Paula Dean \\"crisis\\" and found this book to provide for some extra food for thought regarding that fiasco -- and I believe that's a sign of good literature)
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a quick review for a book that I enjoyed immensely.  It’s fun, light and absolutely hilarious.  If you need a break from the dark and angsty novels we love…then read this book because it’ll give you the break you need.<br /><br />Drew is an absolute pig and so full of himself that it was a little hard for me to like him right away but he was so funny that I could overlook his epic douche-like qualities.  Tangled is told from his POV which I found absolutely refreshing and it felt completely conversational the entire time, almost as if I was sitting on his couch and he’s telling me about his love for Kate.<br /><br />The banter between Drew and Kate was hilarious and I couldn’t seem to get enough, I thought I might tire of it but I didn’t.  And Kate is one of those heroines you will absolutely love because she’s smart, fierce and isn’t a push-over.  Can I get an AMEN for strong female characters?? AMEN!!!<br /><br />“For God’s sake, don’t let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can’t even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break!”<br /><br />Why the five stars? Five because it delivered in writing style, unique male character perspective the entire time and it was hilarious.  I’m totally looking forward to the second book in the series!!!
B00C81LYH2|4.0|This is a beautiful doll, in a beautiful box. The dress is spectacular. I don't really appreciate the differences between Barbie dolls, but this one seems to be a cut above the average. I am saving this for the future. Perhaps one day someone young will play with it...
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So far I have really enjoyed this game and I haven't had to pay a single dime for it.  I will continue to play this on my free time because I recently unlocked some hummingbird warriors.  It also reminds me of evony which I thoroughly enjoyed.
1451629192|5.0|Great book, well written she should write a follow up book about her and her children's life now and their future...
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This story takes \\"parental denial\\" to the highest of heights, and for me, it dragged on and on. It felt a bit like work to get through it.<br />Would I recommend it to a friend? I am on the fence but probably not.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was such a great way to keep the series going, it was just such a let down to have it end suddenly and not have the next book to start on.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is very intense in detail about the main character's survival in the mental condition. The screen writer for the movie production shorted much of the emotional problems involved because of the time limits of a motion picture.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|To think this guy went through a career as a seal and die the way he did trying to help a fellow combatant.  What a shame.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I liked this game at first but i accidently deleted it.  So i reuploaded it. Now they want my password which i forgot.  THEY HAVE A PLACE TO CLICK TO E MAIL YOU YOUR PASSWORD BUT THEY NEVER SEND IT!  So i cant play anymore!  I cant find a place to contact them.  Can anyone help??
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Its sad Bill isnt drumming. Iommi is truly the metal godfather! Sounds like an early release! Ozzy knows, Tony godlike
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very inspiring. I derived a lot of ideas for my small business. The narration was simple and deep. Recommend this book to anyone who wants to make an impression
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Nice come back record! Buy it!!
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|It certainly keeps pones attention even if the subject matter is a well used formula of government deceit and personal betrayal. A typical post Blair, post Iraq book from someone totally opposed to the war in Iraq and New Labour
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|great. really durable ad actually does what i paid for. fast delivery. i'm tired of writing more reviews. that is all
B003ZDO90G|3.0|Somehow I felt dissatisfied, wanting a more complete story. Yes, they are well crafted, well written but something of more substance would have helped. me enjoy it more.
B0090SI460|5.0|Great deal on this combo.  At the time I purchased this item there was a promotion for free $10 voucher to see monsters inc university.  The 3D was incredible.  This is going to be a timeless pixar animation.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|I always find Murakami's books intriguing, the way they operate in a third dimension, outside day to day reality. Which world do we live in? But in the end its a happy book despite the horror. And operating as it does at two levels, it raises quite profound philosophic questions.
B0075TDWEU|1.0|These are fine everyday headphones. Decent sound though not the most durable. The mystery is why, after costing $10 for the last several years, they now run $26. A really bad value.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I had first opened the book, I was kind of waiting for the awe that everyone said I would experience. Little did I know the experience that was upon me. This book is not a happy ending. It is not sex or romance. It's truth, life, and wisdom. Hazel and Gus are deeper than what they appear to be and so are most characters in this book. It's a tough read with a remarkable message that I'm not even sure I get yet. Just read it and make it your own. Thank you John Green you again manage to blow me away with your originality and unique characters.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|I just had to complain. This camera is really terrible. It says it holds up to 80 photos, but after just extremely light use, it gradually decreases the amount it will hold before it freezes up, and now it won't even hold 3 photos. Yes, its a children's camera, but kids these days know how cameras are supposed to perform and expect the pictures to turn out reasonable well, and even when this camera was brand new (it's only 6 months old), the pictures were barely passable. Too bright or underexposed describes all of them. Every time I look at this thing, it irritates me that I wasted money on it. It is adorable, though, so if you just want a lego camera to look at and not touch, this is perfect! ;)
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is an amazing game for families with kids of different ages.  I originally bought it for myself, but before I knew it my nephew that is only seven started playing and www as scoring higher than I was!  Excellent game!
B001KWTBQQ|4.0|Wanted something light to watch and this one was very decent.  I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again.  Worth streaming.  Not worth buying.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is an amazing book!  I can not wait until the next one comes out!  You will not be disappointed!
B006S009IY|4.0|Liberties were taken, but the story is still good and gives insight into how Peter Pan came to be.  In real life the children were much younger when J. M. Barry met the family and the woman's husband was very much alive.  He did, however, adopt the children when their parents both died and shared custody with their grandmother.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is so fun because I love horses<br />It is a great game for whoever loves horses<br />My horse is awesome for all ages well mostly for 5 and up
1451695195|4.0|I found Dr. Eben Alexanders' book recounting his near-death experience to be interesting on several levels, psychological, logical, scientific and spiritual. However, it will probably leave believers and non-believers alike somewhat dissatisfied. One must read it to determine where they fall in regard to his conclusions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It takes a while to figure where to go. Once you get it your hooked. It would help if they gave clues now and then.
