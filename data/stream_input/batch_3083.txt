B00FAPF5U0|2.0|After seeing that some Facebook friends were playing this, I thought I'd give it a try; after all, it's free to download the game.  Fun game, but you can't &quot;earn&quot; special tools through game play, you have to buy them with real money.  Also, when you reach certain levels you either have to buy your way to the next level or play three &quot;challenges&quot; to earn your way to the next level, and here's the catch - after completing one challenge you must wait 24 hours before you can play the next challenge, so it takes at least 3 days to move on when you reach these levels, which is ridiculous!  Unlike other games I've played where you can buy extra tools, you don't earn Amazon coins or anything to offset what you spend.  If you don't want to spend money to play this, it's just a waste of time.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|Forget about the criticisms on the story. The acting was what let me down. What a mediocre effort from all the veterans.<br /><br />I'll only really enjoyed to Pierce for his ability to pull the joke about Chiron being a Centaur.<br /><br />Some other actors were barely ok: Uma thurman, Kevin MacKidd, Sean Bean, Melina Kanakaredes,<br />But others were just unconvincing: Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Coogan and specially Catherine didn't look that interested in doing a good job.<br /><br />They just left me with a feeling they were there just there to show up and get paid.<br /><br />I don't know if it was director but I was really really disappointed because I know that every single one of these people can do their job much much better than this, even on a kid's movie.<br /><br />That was the main reason I wanted to watch this movie: Having Sean Bean together with Kevin MacKidd accompanied by such a great cast (Pierce was a nice surprise) was supposed to be great. But after the very first scene I knew the ride will look like a Disney movie.
B00FAIPDAE|1.0|Fail. Won't open.  Never able to play, so I deleted it.  Looked fun, a lot like Clash of Clans on my iPad, but I'll never know...
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is a wonderdul book.....I haven't been able to put it down since I started reading. Beautiful story. I definitely recommend!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|There is room for a lot of weapon customization. Very fun game. I had it on my android phone and was happy to find it on Amazon as well.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I read Damian's James Bond book, Operation Armada first.  So I'm glad I went back to read Solstice.  It has more mystery, more twists and turns but is just as cinematic. (note: Damian is an expert in films and movies).  This shows that Stevenson has a range of genre skills and a grasp of what readers like.  Looking forward to the next book.  Well done Damian.<br /><br />Jerry Guarino<br />author of \\"The Da Vinci Diamond\\"<br /><br />note: I did receive a complimentary ebook from the author.
B003UGLCIA|3.0|this is a longer version than the theatrical release and is in good shape but without closed captioning. this is a horror movie that was not intended to be such by the writer or the producer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game it's so fun and I love to see the minions. I totally recommend this to all. No matter how old you are I guarantee you will love it too.
B000002J09|5.0|In 1970, Led Zeppelin got a little bit of negative criticism for the third album being too soft. In response, Jimmy Page decided to release the band's fourth album without a title. No words are printed anywhere on the cover. Thus, the album is commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV. The original record did come with a sticker on the shrink wrap bearing the band's name and four strange symbols, which represented the four band members. This has led to other nicknames for the album like Zoso (Jimmy Page's symbol), Four Symbols, The Rune (in reference to the gatefold artwork). Robert Plant himself said the album is nothing more than &#34;Led Zeppelin 4&#34;.<br /><br />This album sold hundred of thousands of copies before it was even released by pre-order. It quickly hit the 1 million mark and is the band's best selling album. Today it's sold at least 29 million copies worldwide.<br /><br />The tracks in the album are some if the band's best known and are as follows:<br /><br />1. Black Dog<br />2. Rock And Roll<br />3. The Battle Of Evermore<br />4. Stairway To Heaven<br />5. Misty Mountain Hop<br />6. Four Sticks<br />7. Going To California<br />8. When The Levee Breaks<br /><br />This album is definitely one of band's best. If for some reason you haven't heard it yet, listen to it immediately!
B000002J0B|5.0|By 1973, Led Zeppelin was a name recognizable throughout the world. The band had just completed a successful USA tour and everything was just great for them. Houses Of The Holy came out the same year and it marks some changes. This album is the first of the band's to have all original material, as all previous albums had borrowed parts from other songs or were straight out covers. This is also the band's first album to have an actual name rather than a numbered title.<br /><br />Tracks on the album are as follows:<br /><br />1. The Song Remains The Same<br />2. The Rain Song<br />3. Over The Hills And Far Away<br />4. The Crunge<br />5. Dancing Days<br />6. D'yer Ma'ker<br />7. No Quarter<br />8. The Ocean<br /><br />This is what I declare my most favorite Led Zeppelin album ever. You'd be a fool not to have this in your collection!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Creative style for telling a story! This was my first foray into the zombie genre and I was very impressed with Brooks' MANY different perspectives of the Zombie War. Excellent read.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|Such a great movie I bought it on blu-ray even though I own the DVD.  Love that they went with the painted poster for the cover.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I am a huge fan of JL!!  I love this CD far more than any of his last CDs.. He's switched up his style a little( IMO), but it's a risk worth taking, the true JL fans, will soak this CD up as well!!<br />I listen to it daily, On my commute to work and back home in the evening!! This is one of my favorite CDs at present.. I would encourage all to try it for themselves...
B006DHAT5K|3.0|I enjoy this movie. A lot. It is nice mindless entertainment for when you just want to laugh and relax.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wife bought the kindle version after reading the books for free from the library. She loves the book and will not but the series down. I have not seen her read this much since twilight and hunger games.

B00BXI0IHS|5.0|The Signature of All Things  Enjoyed the book from beginning to end. Interesting characters and places. I am going to be recommending it for our Book Club read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game. Work  well on Kindle  Fire. Only wish there were ways to earn mot  live  without asking friends or buying them.

B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game is fun just like minecraft if you get the full version you can create maps download maps and get texture packs and its almost better than minecraft because it has Redstone creative and survival but I wish the controls were better and you could play demo worlds longer.

B007SGM084|4.0|Great book!! I have been reading for 50 years,I love to read,and the books certainly keep my attention! So hard to put down!
1451666179|5.0|I love, love her blog--I love, love this book! Yes, there may be stories from the blog, BUT, they are stories that you WANT to read over and over again. They are stories you LOVE to see in print. I love all the drawings, and the colors. It really is a work of art!! I will carry this book around with me for when I need a little pick-me-up! I will buy this book for all my great friends for Christmas!<br /><br />I must add...If you will be disappointed that you may have to re-read some material from the blog, do not buy this book and proceed to rate it with 3 stars. That is sad and you do a disservice to the author.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I'm not a big gamer, so I can't compare to other items, but I like this.  Graphics are fun and it's been an enjoyable challenge to play.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|it is sssssssssssooooooooooo hard but i like being challenged and i love hello kitty. and i love deserts and yummy treats the game makes me hungry
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Amazing graphics, addictive, challenging, my go-to game.  I only wish there were different cube graphics to choose from, like you can find in many mahjongg games.  It would be nice to see a different set of objects/designs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|because i am good at it and i love candy. it is such a fun game. i get stuck on the jellies.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I'm on day 28 of the 30 day plan. It is a relatively easy plan to stick to, especially eating out. I like the way it is written-technical when it needs to be, but offers the option of skipping over those details. Authors are very encouraging and helpful.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The story builds nicely.  A lot of military SF is just filled with dread, but this doesn't pound you over the head with it.  I also found many points where major unexpected things happened in the story.  It was even a good length for me.<br /><br />Minus one point because Orson Scott Card is a homophobe
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. His unique perspective on the topics he studies and the connections and applications of those studies are fascinating.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I've never used a guided relaxation/meditation app before.  I've used it several times now and find it relaxes me quickly.  After many uses I finally heard the end of the recording.  Prior to that I had fallen asleep before it was done.  I like the longer (24 min) option.  At first the voice and entire concept took a little getting used to, but the women's voice is very soothing.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|intellectally ambitious with an adventurous structure which, while providing a framewirk, impedes the nsrrative to a degree. Good setting detal.Perhaos too much?  Author's intrusion in characters annoying to  me.
0345472322|4.0|this make some very interesting points. I would recommend parents and teens read this book. Changing the way you think can be the difference between mediocrety and success.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Fun reading with timely twists & turns of life's truths! Moriarty shares how learning the truth & forgiving are partners.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the preparation for what was to come, which left me longing for the details which was deeply rewarded
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|stargate was one of my favorite series. it is rarely shown on tv.  I am happy that I can stream to my kindle and its free. the picture is clear and the sound is excellent. I am very happy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I've played it on my friends` Apple devices, and I loved it! But I couldn't find it in the Amazon app store. I have a kindle fire, and I love it, but I wanted Candy Crush on it! THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON APP STORE! Candy Crush is a simple addictive game, plus, it's FREE!!!!!! I LOVE CANDY CRUSH!:)
B00632HWOG|3.0|the yahoo mail ap on my phone is much more up to date than the one available for my Kindle Fire (first generation).
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I love Star Trek, having grown up with the original series (remember Spock, Doc and Kirk?), but this movie just went on way too long. Lots and lots ofl action, not much interesting plot.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|silly fun with lots of good puzzles to keep your mind engaged. love the colorful graphics that change as the puzzle goes along
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|A little creepy, a little sweet and romantic, a lot of edge of your seat mystery and suspense.  Anyone who liked the Twilight series should probably really like this movie, maybe even better.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Good old-fashioned scares are both rampant and effective in this film. The effects, music and cinematography combined to make this a beautifully done film.<br /><br />However, as far as the plot goes, the film contradicts itself. In the movie, the demonologists explain that this was a case of demonic possession, meaning, the entity possessing the house never walked the earth in human form. However, the last half of the movie reveals the fact that a dead witch is haunting the land that was once hers. After establishing the fact that this was a demonic possession, it proceeded to show a haunting by a ghost. (Also, other ghosts possessed the house, all of whom were victims of the witch's crazy antics.)<br /><br />In summation, great scares, but confusing mixed messages. This only weakens the credibility of the statement \\"based on true events\\". (As if ghosts and demons did not discredit it enough!)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'm a long-time King fan, and I think this is one of his best in recent years.  It's tightly plotted, well paced, very suspenseful.  One thing that keeps it from being a full five stars is, it doesn't ROCK like King is capable of.  I wanted more battle, more cat and mouse, more jeopardy, more danger.  More BLOOD, to put a fine point on it.  The precursor to this novel, The Shining, was close-your-eyes put-the-book-down scary, and it changed the characters' lives forever, as well as many of its readers.  Doctor Sleep did bring the action, but I felt like after the book, some of the characters just picked up their lives where they had left off.  Maybe they thought of the events of this story every few years, but it ended up being just an outing.  I still enjoyed it, but it's not one I'll add to the rotation of must read every few years.
B00G32TD98|5.0|An Instant  classic! Creepy, well acted, great entertainment! Very believable, not over the top. Will have to buy for the collection!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read right from the start with a crazy ending that you don't see coming!  Haven't read such a compellng story for a long time.  Picked it for book club and I'm glad I did.  It will be a great discussion!!
B0000009S3|5.0|There is not a bad song on this album. In my opinion this was his only pure album from his first years. Only one song has lyrics, and the rest are purely instrumentals. Sugarcane Harris plays on much of this, which was my introduction to his sound. I was new to non-CW (classic) back in the mid-'70s. This was one of the albums I listened to repeatedly during my darkest years as I struggled to find reason to stay alive, and in fact was actually deconstructing on a daily basis. It took years later to be able to listen to it because of the associations with it. But as I matured, I came back to it and it truly is one of the strongest albums he created in the earlier years. No crude lyrics and &#34;ya just gotta have lyrics, you say, so take these fools&#34; attitude. Just incredible rock/jazz creativity unfettered
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|the game is really fun, I enjoy hunting and other outdoor activities,nthis game is perfect for me I would recommend you get it.
B0000029DD|5.0|Oh my gosh! This guy's VOICE is unreal. I just bought this after listening to the samples, reading reviews, and hearing some of his father's music (another VOICE). He has so many octaves it's crazy. And when he cranks it, it is so very strong. There is a lot to hear in this. Eternal Life is one of those &#34;strong&#34; songs. Corpus Christy is one where his voice is so beautiful and musical and high that it makes me shiver in delight.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't have enjoyed it more. A perfect entry in the line of similar books. If you like Suarez' books, there is no possible way imaginable you could not enjoy this book.
0307887448|5.0|At first this book started off very slowly and the premise was so ridiculous I almost put the book down. I am so glad I didn't. This is easily the best book I have read this year!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Big fan of Micheal Jackson and this cd rocks songs to work out to! couldn't this cd anywhere else , but worth the wait.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it was romantic and violent I think Suzzane<br /> Collins did a great job writing this book
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was seriously one of the hottest books I've ever read. Not for the bashful. Definitely for those who love their male leads as alpha as you can get them. The storyline is tragic but beautiful. LOVED IT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME THE NEXT SUBWAY SUFERS [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN SOUTH KOREA. I like how the game is easy.My little sister enjoys being able to play it with out having to have someone help her.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is the bomb!!!<br />and it has the most fun level s in the world and once you play it you get atached.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|I like that this movie streams without an issue.  The movie was neat and my kids enjoy watching this movie.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved this thriller in the vein of another favourite author Patricia Highsmith. The novel was smart with twists and turns and grey - not black and white. Well writtenA. I now await her next novel. I have now read all 3 she has written and find they get better and better.
B008JFUNHI|3.0|Please note that this review is about the movie rather than the DVD release.<br /><br />This movie was visually appealing with great special effects, but you expect that given the state of CGI these days. And the battle and command school action scenes were good. But the movie's main problem is that it dumbed down or glossed over too many aspects of the book that are necessary to the story. And some of the facts were just wrong, as other reviewers here have mentioned also. It's certainly an intense film that keeps the tension building until the final climax. That and the special effects came off well.<br /><br />But the film reminded me of Starship Troopers from 15 years ago, based on the Robert Heinlein novel, which, although doing justice to the battle scenes (despite the lack of powered armor) and violence in the book, glossed over too much of the back story, and overall didn't do justice to the complexity of the book. Sci-fi fans here will also probably recall the film versions of Dune, which had a few problems of their own but did a better job of doing justice to Herbert's novel.<br /><br />Back in the 30s and 40s Hollywood knew how to tell a complicated, subtle story. The classic movies of the Golden Age of Cinema put modern films to shame. Now special effects are everything and the plot, dialog, and story line suffer and take a back seat to the special effects, especially in the sci-fi genre. Why this is I don't know. Perhaps modern directors and producers aren't as erudite as their Golden Age counterparts or they think modern audiences are just dumber and need similarly dumbed down movies. Perhaps this is what sells so that's what people get. I don't claim to be an expert on film history so perhaps someone here who is will comment on that at some point.
B003B02O0A|5.0|His first and best novel, horrible in some ways but a great story that will hold your attention until the very end.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh writes with a lovely grace and knowledge of her subject matter, incorporating the story line with the flowers she loves.  She inspires the reader to be more aware of the meanings that flowers represent.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Love these games.  I like the 20x20 games the best.  They are more challenging.  All of them are fun.  Very addictive.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great Clock Very Nice Looking Works Well Doesn't Interfere with Other Apps Custom Weather Setting Is A Nice Touch Would Like More Choices in Colors but overall this App Doesn't Suck
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I have not been able to watch this, simply for the fact I haven't had the time.  But I will always give this show a 5 star rating.  It is my all time favorite sitcom.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I did not know the President 's club existed, this book described the relationships, behind the scenes politics and mostly how controlling Nixon was for years and years after he left office.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE IT!! It is a awesome game, I wonder what the breeding mix is for the skeleton Dragon and ghost Dragon. Please make a review on this game that says the breeding mix of all the dragons.
B002Y3I2B0|5.0|Without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time.  Allen has brought together a great cast and acting skills.  Love Penelope Cruz's performance!
014241011X|5.0|I purchased this book for my young niece for school.  She said she loved it. She read the book, did a book report and received a outstanding from her teacher.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I read a few reviews before I bought this last book in the series. Most of them didn't like the ending and didn't like the book because of the ending... well, I kinda didn't like the ending either... but I thought the book was good. I liked the first two better... this one seemed to drag a bit for me. But overall the series is creative and very enjoyable. I would recommend them to anyone.
1446303314|5.0|This book has beautiful projects and great photography. Can't wait to get sewing. I want to make everything in the book!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was hard to put down.  The story was compelling and very interesting.  Author did a good job on this book.
B009CGGHL4|5.0|I like this movie because it's a fresh take on a buddy-zombie movie, while paying homage to the classics of the genre.
B0098Z64US|4.0|received in timely fashion..in good shape.. cd sound was acceptable on my portable player.. however, dvd wouldnt play( visual and music) past the first piece of music.. tried several times.. just looped back to first piece..not worth it to send back, as cd is fine...
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Excellent recording of this live show. The show itself has some of the usual ALW issues. Music is divine, but the lyrics are not as striking as POTO. In fact, they're a little trite. And Raoul's character could have gone that way, I suppose. It certainly served the plot. I know some people say it was out of character, but maybe not. Knowing you are the runner-up husband might do things to a guy.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I finished this book last night. I. Love the world Ms Draven has created, harsh and somewhat other worldly but definitely believable. I enjoy a story when the hero and heroine are not perfect and I like when the romance takes time to build. I have a soft spot for crows, so the title caught my eye. It was the story that hooked me and kept me reading until late I the night.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great story solid acting one of TVs best shows ! Murder house is filled with secrets and deaths a unique experience I love it!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Excellent!!! I was curious to see what the high definition version was like. I'm am very pleased that I picked up these classic titles!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|AMAZING!!!  Could not put this book down and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Glad to see how Danny turned out after all these years.  The characters are brought to life so vividly, you can picture them well as you read along.  Excellent followup to The Shining.  Stephen King is a genius.  A must read!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really a great game. Love that you can pick the number size of the puzzle which makes it fun for all ages. My 5 year old really enjoys it as well as daddy!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|For those saw the Netflix TV show, expecting the book to be similar, they will be disappointed. Piper never went to solitary confinement. Never became a prison snitch. Never had prison sex with her old girlfriend. (They weren't even in the same prison.) What the book does have is the true story of what is like for an educated, upper middle class woman's view of prison life, and the people she met. If you read it from that perspective, you will enjoy it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A fun comedy that would be a great date movie.  Somewhat of a &#34;chick flick&#34;, but I still know guys that found it very fun...my husband included!  Great songs, fun actors/actresses.  If you're looking for a lighthearted movie that will make you smile, this is it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like the game a lot I'm just trying to get lots of coins and one adjective is to give a review so git it and have fun
B0057ZSPD2|4.0|Good songs. The songs are rebellious and about life with clear lyrics and strong guitar riffs. A fun spirit and great in concert.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Just finished this one and couldn't put it down.<br />Plenty of &#34;twists&#34; in the plot;  I actually guessed wrong on the identity of the bad guy.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|As I have been working on trusting my gut instinct about my spiritual beliefs and general society expectations, I found Anita's storey and message just perfect. I was drawn to the author and found her writing style easy to read and hard to put down. I felt genuine joy for her and her new found life and hopeful and excited about my own. Excellem
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope. One of the best games on android. After completing all the levels, I went back and made sure to get 3 star on all. Very nice and enjoyed it for hours.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Katy Perry is such an awesome beautiful person and I knew going in that I liked her music, having gotten and listened to her first 2 albums 'One of the Boys' and 'Teenage Dream' many times. So it was a no brainer that I was going to get this album. She is one of the at least two artists that I'll buy music from no questions asked.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a little hard to get into with all the different characters, but the story certainly kept my interest!  A little disappointed in the ending.
B00338QENI|5.0|An inspiring and at times disturbing ride with one of the most acclaimed authors of 2010. This work is appreciated for its depth and audacity. Thank you for this work of love and justice.

0156027321|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Life of Pi. What made is such a slow read was the constant description of the simplest things. The author could have easily took the bulk out of many different scenes throughout the book. I also felt their was a lack of dialogue. Like Meghan said on Amazon.com, \\"Slow read, I didn't care for the dialect of the book- it is quite wordy and not that concise.\\" I feel the same way she did, and it was a popular to call the book a \\"slow read\\" on this website. I also had very high expectations for this book based on the reviews I read, and what people had told me. I thought that it would change my life, but unfortunately it didn't. What I did like about the book was the ending. It caused me to think a lot about whether or not it was a true story. But, then again, did it matter? I also think this book is different then most I have read. Eco criticism was present throughout the entire story because of the tiger he was with on the boat. He also lived on a zoo so animals were a huge part of the story. You could analyze their significance and the relationships they were apart of. The book also analyzed from the Marxist lense. A power struggle was very throughout the entire story between the tiger and Pi. The story was easy to analyze literary because of the hidden concepts and presence of critical lenses.<br /><br />  I wouldn't say that this book is a complete waste of money because many do enjoy it. I just don't think that this purchase would change someone's life. I recommend this book to anyone from elementary school to adults. However, I don't think the typical Nicholas Sparks-reading teenage girl would enjoy this. But, I do still think that any gender, or age can read this book and possible enjoy it. Anyone interested in religion would definitely enjoy this book because the main character, Pi, practices 3 different religions at one time. I also think people who are interested in animals would enjoy this book because animals are talked about through the entire story. Overall, the book was ok for me, but I do think others would enjoy it.
0670024856|4.0|The Signature of All Things is wondrous and astonishing in both its breadth and detail. Seen primarily through the perspective of the inimitable Alma Whittaker, a botanist with an inexhaustible craving for knowledge, the narrative explores a treasure of ideas in the field of natural science. The story of Alma's father Henry and the peerless Whittaker family is meticulously developed and beautifully told. For such a multigenerational epic, the story is never slow or boring. The lovely, erudite prose seemingly gallops along. Passion exudes on every page. But with all the intelligence and rapture the book delivers, some of its adventures felt as if they could have elevated to a higher level. The ending, though satisfying and interesting, came across as decidedly more expository, rather than revelatory. Nonetheless, this is a rich and enchanting novel that I highly recommend. It is an impressive literary work and a joy to read, but it did not quite reach a flawless quality that would make it a masterpiece.
B0061S073A|4.0|Love this!  I don't really like my kids playing on my phone, since they always seem to access something they shouldn't. I \\"hide\\" all my games in kidsplace, so if they manage to get on to my phone without permission they are in a controlled environment. I love the relaunch in 5 secs. feature.  If while they are playing a game they accidentally exit, the game restarts in 5 secs. I wish that time was a little shorter or you had an automatic return button because 5 secs can be an eternity for a toddler. :)
B009CG96QM|5.0|Ingenious with a sarcastically unique twist. Entertaining yet reminiscent of the atrocities which once took place. A must see multiple times.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik doesn't work anymore , I used to use Kik everyday but now it's unavailable. Bring kik back. Nothing works ,I tried deleting it and downloading it again but when I went to download it out said currently unavailable.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Ok fellows viewers, this series is a must see.  Engrossing, funny, and so well acted.  Can't wait for the next installments.  Photography in and around London top notch!  Great twists on old Sherlock stories with modern and humerous touches.  Watson is marvelous and, sometimes, holds his own with Sherlock.  Benedict Cumberbatch takes Holmes to a new level.  Well, boils down to can't say enough about this BBC series except thank you.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|Misleading!! The name is \\"Shimmer 'n Sparkle\\". The box has prominent photos of bracelets with beads, some of which sparkle. However, they are not included!! It is a piece of plastic and rubberbands, with a plastic crochet hook. Total waste of money. The loom has prongs on the pegs, which catch the bands as you attempt to move them. The \\"Rainbow\\" loom has pegs that are much easier to work with, and they do not deceive you with their name and advertising.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! I said I wouldn't play games on Facebook and now I play all the time.  If you don't have it buy it now!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was an amazing book. But...<br /><br />***********SPOILER************<br /><br />The author got me pissed at the end. I mean, who makes the main character die? I was literally crying my eyes out. She risked her life for her scum-bag brother. Making Tris die was awful. The author needs to change the ending. I am so disappointed
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put it down!  When I'm not reading it I'm thinking about it.  My husband made fun of me for talking out loud while reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just got my new kindle fire HD, and this is one of the first games I downloaded. Very fun, it's like the experience of having a horse it you're like me and can't afford a real one
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Just a lovely well acted and  paced show - I wish there were more like it - I would recommend this highly. We try to watch shows like this while having chemo as it is relaxing and &#34;feel good&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|People don't realize it's a copy of Bejeweled. I just hats Candy Crush. I don't care what people say, I hate it so much. Having to pay levels and links to go on Facebook everytime you complete a stupid level. I HATE IT!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The book was captivating, it typically do not like trilogies but this was perfect. Good character development and different genre from the first two.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Me encanta la narrativa de Carlos Ruiz Zafon, es un libro que te absorbe que te cuesta despegarte, pero que también quieres disfrutar!!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Excellent page turner. The sort of history you enjoy learning. Clear and reader friendly. Covers the topic in a cogent, non-technical manner.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a lot more fun to play on a tablet. The bigger screen and sharp images are fantastic. Wish it didn't take over a year to release the tablet&nbsp;version. Some of us don't play phone versions of games, but still enjoy talking to our friends whom do about games like this.
B005MLP8E0|3.0|Great old Classic. Had to watch it for Film class in support of the chapter's current topic. Good movie overall!
B009GCF3Q4|3.0|These are good stories but I am not a great fan of short stories. cant say much more.<br />except enjoy.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Awesome series! This, Dexter, and Burn Notice are my 3 favorite series of late by FAR. I've got the whole series on blu ray.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This a great free fighting game. It does require a Facebook sign in to get some of the game items, but even that is free. The only time you'll have to pay is if you choose to get buy in game currency instead of spending a little time to earn it. The game also has local multiplayer so you can play with your friends on the same connection. The movie tie in is also a nice gimmick, but doesn't really alter any of the game's story, so even if you've never heard of the movie, you can still have fun playing.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Love this group, their music is kind of funky and can not stop dancing,is a must in any party they are awesome!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Well this game is really fun but it was free I don't know why it costs something now but at least it's cheap
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this to keep my Komachi knives sharp and it does a perfect job. I use the carbide side every couple of months to get the blade straight from the knifes being thrown in the sink and then use the ceramic side every week to fine adjust the sharpness of the blade. When running it through the ceramic side about six times it will easily slice through anything. I love this thing and it is very small to easily fit in the knife drawer. I only spend about six minutes sharping a knife with this. Well worth the money
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book that you have to read. I loved it and I think you will too!!! Best book I've ever read.
B008MM9630|5.0|Lots of extras you can buy, standard farming game, a little short on time.  Only complaint or enough time to do what needs done....
B001B1UO6W|4.0|its a classic child play is by far the best of the series! i own whole series one is the best one!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|A fascinating read. Full of insights that I have never read before. Will change your perception of advantages and disadvantages in life.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|In pretty much enjoy this game but I dislike having to wait for friends to unlock levels.GREAT GAME THO!!!<br /><br />!
B001BANK32|3.0|I saw the flick years ago when it hit the theatres. This has a lot more detail and scenes I don't recall from the movie. I will say that I think the one distractor I observed is the story actually ended before the book did. One line was missing that I recall from the move which set the entire audience laughing...it was when the character Jack, played by Jack Nicholson broke through the door where Wife Wendy was hiding...his head sticking through with a maniacal grin Jack says; Here's Johnny!&#34; Sadly, it wasn't in the book.
B009XI7RF6|4.0|I downloaded this FAOTD this morning and am now at the second coloring book, level 5, which means that I have been playing this game since I downloaded it! There are three books of 25 levels.<br /><br />It reminds me of \\"Sugar Sugar\\", which is a very clever game where you have to control the flow of white sugar through colored filters in order to produce the correct colored sugars. It is an animated game and gets very complex -- and frustratingly difficult -- very quickly. This is what I like about Pandoodle. While it's a much simpler game, it is still challenging to find the shortest path for each color in order to produce the correct results. It is difficult enough to be interesting but not so hard as to become totally frustrating. I usually replay a level until I achieve three stars but there are still a couple of levels where I haven't yet found the perfect solution.<br /><br />In the second book you're introduced to mirrors. (There's an English problem in the instructions that refers to \\"reflexing\\" instead of \\"reflecting\\" but otherwise the instructions are decent.) I find the mirror challenges quite difficult.<br /><br />Graphics are okay but very basic. The game works well enough on the Kindle Fire HD but I do occasionally have problems drawing a line if I'm not applying exactly the right pressure (seems to stop or get \\"stuck\\") although I'm not sure whether it's because of the stylus I'm using. Another reason I'm rating it 4 stars and not 5 is that there are not enough levels for a paid app (and others have noted there are more levels in the free version in Google Play - although I have not checked that out myself).<br /><br />One other change I would suggest: As soon as you've solved a puzzle, the score comes up and covers the completed puzzle. I wish there was a way to close the score window so you can see what you just did. It's hard to improve your score if you can't remember your previous moves and don't have a chance to examine where you might have gone wrong.wrong.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Tired zombie apocalypse theme w with weak character development. We should demand more from hollywood than the cliche zombie destruction of western civilization.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is only my second Neil Gaiman read (the other being &#34;American Gods&#34;, which I didn't like quite as well), but it *certainly* won't be my last.<br /><br />This one is a fast read; It has a fascinating storyline, and I was completely immersed in it from the second that I began reading!<br /><br />Thanks very much, Mr. Gaiman!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, enjoyed the book even more....<br />I am an avid reader, and this is a book I can easily recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the crush but had to uninstall and  install again. I was on level 58 and had to start over. Not happy. Also had paid to advance to next  level. Guess that is money lost. Just like all the time spent playing.

B008Q00KEW|3.0|Interesting to watch, but ultimately unsatisfying.  A little too dark for the Next Generation. Too bad the series had to end like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is addicting! graphics are great and game play is very good! compete and train your horse. and aquifer more experience, coins, and other game amenities.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|the google chromecast it's a good thing for the price,I see a good potential, but for now it's quite limited,
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|If I could watch it all over again for the first time, I would. Unfortunately, not even a meticulously executed slingshot around the sun to go back in time could erase the memory of just how perfect this film was.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never read a book as juvenile and ridiculous as this one.  The author seems to have several problems.  Tell me, Ms. James. Do you know the meaning of the words murmur and mutter?  I fail to understand how Grey and Ana can have a conversation as they're always speaking to one another under their breath. No plot, no redeeming qualities, no nothing! I murmured. lol. I have also known many people from all over the world in my lifetime, and never had the pleasure of meeting any man or woman as horny, uninhibited and naïve as your so called heroine. And, as for Mr. Grey, Sir!  You do have a remarkable imagination but sorry.  NO TALENT.  The only thing that keeps you going are the poor stay at home people who have never reached up to the stars and beyond to experience life.  One can dream...but until one can live the dream and truly experience life...well, they wind up reading trash like yours.  Oh!  Won't bother wasting time and money on the rest of your books or the upcoming movie (I can upchuck right now at the thought of it)  Better Book Choice?  Fifty Shades of Beige
B000W93CHC|5.0|Found Pillars of the Earth on deployment a couple years ago.  Almost didn't read it because it was so darn big... well I'm glad I didn't let that scare me off.  World Without End and the first book (Pillars of the Earth) are a couple of the best books I've ever read.  I think that they absolutely had to be as big and long as they are to tell the story right, and Ken Follet really told it right.  Highly recommend.  Excellent descriptions and accurate depiction of what life would have been like way back when, as well as the attention to detail with personal interaction, ambition, wisdom and ignorance... Loved it.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|This series is turning into a soap opera. Leave the prison, and get back to the adventures we saw in season one. This show is still good, but get back to the basics.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very entertaining book. Got quite a few raised eyebrows when reading this before the movie... now it's pretty much pop culture.  Definately enjoyed the book more than the movie, but that is often the case.  Not a literary masterpiece by any means but a nice easy read to pass the time.  Even makes for good conversations afterwards.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play.  Just don't like to need tickets and lives. They make you stop your play and wait to get friends to help.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham has returned to a place get never should have left, Ford County.  This is a well-crafted, though somewhat predictable story, but the characters are again alive & lively.
0143122010|5.0|One of the most important books I have ever read. In our time, People line up sulking about the world coming to an end. Pinker's extensive research is a real eye-opener on the opposite, and his way of writing is right out entertaining. Highly recommended.
B008Q0AP2E|3.0|Been wanting to see this one for a while, have often heard it referenced. Liked it but was slow to follow, storyline didn't start picking up until almost halfway through...
0307352153|3.0|I started out with enthusiasm, and feel very familiar with Cain´s world. Then, after the initial thrill of finding out I´m not alone, I kinda relaxed and left the book on the table. Sure, Susan Cain probably still has a lot to tell me, but I found it too laborious to read on. I often feel like this with great books. The author successfully spends the first 50 pages presenting the whole idea, yet still has to write 300 pages more to make it a full-size book. Maybe I am too introverted?
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Why force a dictionary on fire owners if we can't even do a word search in it. This is ridiculous.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The 2 star says that it means I don't like it. That is not quite true. The game itself is really quite cute, fun, & addictive. It's the costly addictive part I don't like. Not being overly adept at games I am very annoyed that once you run through lives you have to wait a couple of hours to regenerate your lives. Oh wait, you can do it sooner at .99 cents/5 lives. Also, the power-ups cost additional money (from .99 cents to 1.99). Sorry, I prefer apps and games where I pay once and can play when I want as often as I want. Just got offline from buying some more Big Fish games. Much cheaper and just as much fun that way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is amazing and very addictive. I cant seem to stay away from it for a long time or I go crazy.. thanks for whoever made this awesome game.
B00EEXPDTM|5.0|I read 'Ordeal' over 20 yrs ago,-- this movie moved me. I'm so glad Amanda S. portrayed Linda and not Lohan. What a great A-List star cast on top of it. I've never seen Deep Throat, and really don't need to after reading Ordeal. I'm so glad Linda got to finally find true love and have a child she got to keep. If you're looking to be 'turned-on' sexually-then go watch Deep Throat if that's what you're in to. If you're looking for a true little hero that got away before she REALLY fucked up her life and was saved by the very men who put up the money for 'DT'---Then this is for you. I wish I could have met Linda and interviewed her. I gave this movie 5 stars because they stuck with what Linda wrote in Ordeal as best as Hollywood can, and because Amanda S did an excellent job and gained a new fan. Enjoy! - [The Lu Valentino Show - Syndicated on over 200 rock stations nationwide via WestwoodOne.]

B004J4WNL2|5.0|\\"Quiet\\" makes introversion what it always should have been: feel natural. While I was growing up I often wondered if something was wrong with me just because I prefered staying in reading, studying or doing stuff by myself, rather than going out and staying up late every night, partying. I began embracing my introversion (and feeling comfortable with myself) in the last few years, realizing \\"it's just the way I work\\" and there's nothing wrong with that (considering that up to 50% of the population works just the same way I do, for starters). Susan Cain also embarks on a journey of self-discovery throughout the book, and it's so funny!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This film affected me so much, that I could not sleep that night thinking of the torture people who abandon their pets put them through.<br /><br />Superbly portrayed story of the loyalty afforded us humans by these remarkable creatures.<br /><br />Every person who has or wants to have a dog for a pet should be forced to watch this film

1455526959|4.0|During the course of the L.A. riots in 1992, Harry Bosch, then a young detective, was the first investigator on the scene of the murder of Anneke Jespersen. Jespersen, an attractive photo-journalist from Denmark, was found executed in a dark ally in the middle of the riot zone by national guardsmen who were attempting to provide crowd control. But at the height of the rioting, Harry had no opportunity to do anything more than make a cursory examination of the scene before he was ordered away to another homicide. In the wake of the riots, the Jespersen killing was assigned to a special task force and the case was never solved.<br /><br />This is one of those cases that has always haunted Harry and now, twenty years later, the same gun that killed the young journalist is used in another murder. Bosch, who is now assigned to the department's Open-and-Unsolved Unit, jumps at the chance to reopen the Jespersen case and finally provide a very belated justice for the victim.<br /><br />It will not be easy. The chain of evidence is almost hopelessly murky and would frustrate any detective less tenacious than Bosch. In addition to confronting an almost impossible case, Harry is also soon up against department bureaucrats who are interested only in posting statistics that make them look good, who do not share Harry's sense of the Mission of a homicide detective, and who for their own nefarious reasons, would rather this particular case not be solved.<br /><br />Bosh will not be deterred. He makes an end run around his supervisors and doggedly pursues the case as he believes he should. He's desperately searching for the &#34;Black Box,&#34; which will provide the solution to the case, but in the end, the term will become much more than a metaphor as Harry uncovers a particularly dark and disturbing series of crimes.<br /><br />As he investigates the case, Harry continues to grapple with the complex challenges involved in raising a teenage daughter by himself. He also has a new woman in his life and this relationship is difficult as well, but watching him juggle all of these responsibilities is a treat, as always. All in all, this is an excellent entry in one of the best crime series in the history of the genre. Twenty-five years after first introducing Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly just continues to keep getting better and better.woman in his life and this relationship is difficult as well, but watching him juggle all of these responsibilities is a treat, as always.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Did not see it coming!!  THe book is full of twist plots - it really sucks you in and is hard to put down.
0765348276|4.0|What could be more contradictory- old, rebuilt soldiers? After lifetimes of love, toil, maybe kids and spouse, they enlist to become like [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]]. Ready to fight any aliens contending for choice new worlds. Suffice to say that people do want the opportunity to be young again; downside, they must take orders which could end this too.  This is a completely new take on what appears to be a major concern of SF authors, and it's imaginative. This book is not all death and destruction; it is a great beginning to a series.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|This game is rigged its so rigged I couldn't move my thing to hit the puck this game sucks don't buy it this is the worst game in the history in the world so do not buy it
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Childishly written soft porn fairy tale.<br />Unlikely characters, both good and evil actually characterizations of themselves at times made me roll my own eyes
B00E9ZATTY|4.0|The more I watched this movie the better I liked it. It's not a bad movie. If I would have reviewed this movie when I first saw it at the drive-in, It would've gotten 2 stars.  I went to see it just because of my kids and I wasn't impressed.  Honestly I was getting tired of the sequels, prequels, and spin-offs to previous Pixar movies. But when I got the Blu-ray and watched it a couple more times I thought it was pretty good. It also has a lot of good lessons in it.  They don't get off easy in the end. Because they cheated, they don't get let back in with a slap on the wrist. In fact, they don't get let back in at all.They have to work they're way up from the bottom in the mail room at the business they wanted to work. I still hope Pixar gets back in to more original stories.
0316055433|5.0|All this talk of how “Dickensian” Donna Tartt’s novel is is curious—is it because it has many characters and takes its hero from Park Avenue to an abandoned Las Vegas development returning to the desert  in the rubble of the housing bubble? Maybe. But it could also be for another reason. Remember those stories of people waiting on the dock for the next installment of a Dickens novel to arrive by ship from England? I could not wait to get home to pick up “The Goldfinch” and see that happened next. Donna Tart has truly realized the promise of her earlier novels.
B0046B6X1E|4.0|As a classic  this movie holds up to the hype ... good acting and very entertaining.<br />While it's not as scary as the shining..it has its moments
B00ESNE696|5.0|cutting edge stuff. great cast. great, great writing. hard to predict. who would have thought the law could be so exciting?
B008OJ291W|5.0|I've been an ELO fan since 1979. This album is a great treat for ELO fans. Jeff Lynne sounds better than ever. Especially on 'Showdown'.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I love this for the convenience of wireless listening to my iPod classic with a Bluetooth headset. It works very well.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Puzzles can be fast and easy or more difficult! Background music adds a nice touch! Totally relaxing! Love this game!
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent show! I am a fan. Never a dull moment. Engaging in the present time but still get a good feel for all the characters. I like how it was adapted to present day! Well done! Can't wait for season 3.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Starting to like the Evernote program's &#34;syncability&#34; between my computer, kindle and phone. Keeps my thoughts organized and my notes easy to recover.
B002W7P5UE|5.0|I was in the mood for a classic and this one fit the bill. Loved it. Love love love love
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy to use, just like on facebook. Eventually my fingers got used to tapping the smaller boards, but at first I was really slow because I'd hit the wrong number, have to erase it, hit the right number, then be three numbers behind. But I think I've got the hang of it now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting. I just can't put it down; I have to make it to the next level.
B00CKKDZ2S|2.0|I don't want the free app because it leaves out the future positions. Those are the ones I want to see so I can judge whether I need to change anything in the present to avoid the current most possible outcome. Very limited in comparison to the paid app.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read. Hard to put down. This is the second one of his I have read. Looking forward to the next one.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a really fun game . The kids enjoy it I enjoy we have so much fun trying to figure out the right solution ,,,,try it you'll like it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have to say the Blu-ray transfer of these films is excellent. I really like the movies (well, the first two, for sure) and seeing them in stunning Blu-ray with enhanced sound quality is almost like seeing new movies...even better than the theater versions I first saw.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool in a \\"picture book\\" style case. The discs are securely held in place, each in their own cardboard sleeve. Although this serves well to hold the discs, it is a bit difficult to get them out of the recessed circular holders. I read another reviewer say, (paraphrasing) with practice they are not too hard to remove. Uh, something I really don't want to practice.<br /><br />I do like that these discs go straight the movies without any previews or advertising although they may take a moment to load because they want to use your internet connection. So, if your player has not already established an internet connection, these discs may force/wait for connection then load movie controls. You may speed loading time by turning off your BD-Live feature on you Blu-ray/DVD player.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy to have these movies on Blu-ray included with many extras as well as Director's Cut of Alien and Extended version of Aliens. Plus, it appears the first movie (Alien) is double-layered with the SD version. I know I waited to buy these movies but, for 20 dollars, I'll give it 5 stars even with the mediocre movies, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Every body has been talking about Candy Crush Saga.  I'm glad to finally find it available for my  kindle fire. Fun!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I am really impressed with the Blu-ray quality of these movies. The upgraded (Blu-ray transfer) picture quality is amazing. The detail and space scenes are truly outstanding. And to hear them in Dolby HD sound makes it really feel like I'm flying around right in the Enterprise. And, of course, the movies (most) are really well written and directed. I am a Trekky.<br /><br />The packaging is nice with each movie in its own slim-line DVD case. They are rather tight in the cardboard box holder...it's like trying to get ketchup out of the bottle.<br /><br />I wish this set included the Director's Cut and I don't like that there are previews before the movie. Otherwise, along with the extras, this is a 5 star collection.<br /><br />Overall, for $30.00, I am very happy to have this set in my Blu-ray/DVD library.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game, occasionally when buying credits or coins it didn't go through but customer service was great help with the situation.
B00EVW013E|3.0|Good action movie. This movie is not a &#34;wow that was awesome&#34; but is very fun to watch. Not a great plot and doesn't keep you guessing but lots of action and fighting.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Excellent writing as usual but be ready for lots of baseball statistics and for someone like me who is not an aficionado of the game,it gets a bit boring. I therefore skipped those sections. A bit of a shame. Don't usually like to do that. But it must be very interesting for those who understand the game. Audrey
B005T87QCI|3.0|really good graphics and a lot of fun. nothing bad except the money total of around 15$ total if you want to unlock all bots and functions. .99cents is just a starting price
1452110581|5.0|My master, P'Knut, is very pleased with me for having read this. Now he won't have to waste his time trying to get this mere human to understand the deep meaning behind his meow, tail flicks and his fur. On everything.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This  game was probably one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics were incredible and smooth. Kudos to the developers. It was challenging, had to put it down a few times to really think. Not for people looking for a simple seek and find game. It was a very good mind strategy game. Can't wait to play the epilogue! Bring on more of this!
0671015206|5.0|This book is awesome! Very informative and clear, I just wish they would make an updated one for the 2000's!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|It goes without saying James Cameron's 1984 Terminator is one of the most iconic sci-fi thrillers ever made (even selected by the Library of Congress for preservation!), and this masterpiece has been hurting for a decent Blu-ray release for quite some time now! Now I'm not going to go into the details of this movie, as countless other reviewers already have done so. Instead my review is going to focus on the quality of this new release. I, like many of you out there have held out from buying this on Blu-ray after hearing about how the other releases didn't do this movie justice, that's finally been remedied with this 2013 release! As other viewers have already stated the biggest difference with this release is the new color timing given to the film. No longer does the movie have that infamous \\"red push\\", instead the film has been given a cooler more natural color timing, which makes the movie look even more timeless. If you look at pictures of the old color timing of this movie, and the one from this release, it is a definite improvement. As for the sharpness and clarity of the picture, I have to say Terminator has never looked better! In previous releases (including the special edition DVD release years ago) some details appeared fuzzy and hard to make out, not with this release! You can make out very fine details with crystal clarity, such as the Police ID badges Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen's characters wear in the movie. This release has the 5.1 Dolby stereo mix which was done for the special edition DVD (done by Skywalker sound and supervised by James Cameron, who always wanted this film to have a stereo mix, but Orion pictures said no and gave the movie a cheaper mono sound mix). There's a lot of mixed feelings out there about this, as a die-hard fan of the franchise who grew up watching the first two films, hearing the stereo remix for the first time felt really weird to me, but after a while the 5.1 mix grew on me. There are directional sound effects, which are very apparent during the gun fight scenes. While the sound effects now sound crisp and modern, the music has unfortunately suffered in this 5.1 mix, as Brad Fidel's iconic score for this movie was reproduced by Skywalker sound (instead of having him re-record the soundtrack himself in stereo), and there is indeed a lack of verisimilitude to his original score done for the original mono release. In my opinion this movie would benefit greatly from a new 5.1 mix with the soundtrack done right! Hopefully next time they can get Brad himself to re-record the soundtrack in stereo! I do agree with other reviewers they should have included the original mono soundtrack with this release, but it's not that big of a deal for me (it might be for some fans out there however). A small nitpick I do have with this release is the lack of a dedicated menu. This movie has what's known as a \\"pop up\\" menu, which is a simple menu selection screen that \\"pops\\" during the movie when you push the up arrow key on your remote. For a movie as iconic as The Terminator, you'd think they could have designed a snazzy menu screen for this release. Overall though it's the playback of the movie that counts the most right? And with the newly remastered picture I give this movie and this 2013 Blu-ray release 5 stars! Of all the releases of this movie to date, this is the one to own.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|While the novel finally achieved cohesion near the end, the plot was labored and somewhat repetitive.  And the ending was contrived.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I  LOVED it! It surprised me to the very end. Seth and Apollo -wow! I don't want to have a spoiler here for anyone, but they came through! Thank you Jennifer for letting Alex and Aiden have their happy ending and writing such a great series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is slow to get in to, but the tale draws you in deeper and deeper. I find myself thinking, &#34;Winter is Coming&#34;, and wondering who will be the king. Many books to go...
B002N5N4M6|4.0|In season two, 'The Big Bang Theory' went from being a somewhat funny (if derivative) sitcom to a clever one that was well-written and contained much more character development. I think that season three is a slight step down from what the writers accomplished in the second season, but still great and probably the funniest yet. The humor becomes much smarter in three, with less bathroom humor and physical gags that make it look like a dumbed-down sitcom for the masses. I'm sure the addition of Amy will also be a good idea.<br /><br />Best episodes: \\"The Staircase Implementation\\" and \\"The Lunar Excitation\\"<br /><br />Season grade: B+
B004GYY714|5.0|good selection; easy access; worked well; I was surprised how easy it was to find the football games I wanted. Not too comlicated even for me.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I had fun with this game. Physics based with a little challenge but not so much that it was frustrating.  You can beat any level after a few tries. Cute and fun.
B005SZADQS|1.0|The first couple of episodes make it seem like this might be a good show.  It isn't.  By the third episode I was completely bored with it.  The show doesn't build an interesting narrative.  It is predictable and shallow.  The characters are inconsistent, they do things and act in ways that do not fit with the character as developed.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My three year old grandson loves trains, so this game was ideal. It is so easy for him to learn, just like the description stated. It is perfect!!! Love it
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This is not very easy to use. Wish I knew how to get in the business so I could design something myself.
0316228583|5.0|This book is 3 weeks late going back to the library because it takes a while to get going. There are a lot of characters and you are very thoroughly introduced to them all. It's hard to keep them straight and honestly quite boring. BUT get through those first 100 pages and you won't be able to put it down. I feel like I need to reread the beginning now that I know the characters.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not much of a coherent story, but still a good read.  Amazon should not require a minimum amount of words for each review.  Last review for me Amazon.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Oh, Paranormal Activity, how far you have fallen.  This film was so boring, and slow, and not scary in the least.  There literally was not one scary moment in the movie.  And I am not that hard to scare.  You take an adorable little boy and try to make him creepy.  Fail.  And Katie, the psycho?  She had lots of chances to be scary, but was not.<br /><br />The parents of the female teen character in this movie are dumber than the Kardashians.  Knives are disappearing, falling from the ceiling, chandeliers fall, a stranger drops off their small child and they take him in, but they still won't listen to their daughter's warnings that \\"something is wrong with Robbie.\\"<br /><br />The end was super dumb.<br /><br />I want a PA 5, but please make it horror.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Good read.  Brings Ender full circle.  If they ever make a movie of it I hope they don't butcher it like they did Enders Game.  Just sayin.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Absolutely love the game, and keep going back to it whenever I get bored! Got it as the faotd, but I feel like it would definitely be worth 1 or 2 dollars
B008Q0D32S|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first released & have never lost interest in it. Henry Fonda was in his prime & Jack Elam is timeless, unfortunately we have lost them both.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|Good movie to watch with family. Nice Sci-Fi to get into and funny one liners.<br />Love Jeff Bridges in this and Kevin Bacon plays a good bad guy.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works great for calculating anything, hard to understand why it is not built into the Android OS it is a basic need.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Can't stop playing. Awesome game and very challenging! Still crushing candy and waiting for 5 lives. Increasing lives would be great unfortunately wouldn't get much done
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|An excellent movie with a horrid concept, to kill young adults while broadcasting the &#34;Games&#34; then sound a cannon when one is taken.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|Thought provoking.  This book makes a reader think and wonder. I don't agree with all the author has to say but it is certainly worth reading. That is unless one is afraid of challenges to the established  thinking and beliefs.
B00G32TD98|3.0|Definitely some scary points in the movie, but balanced out with some very cheesy dialogue at some points.  Not something I regret renting, but not a great movie either.  Was surprised it was rated so high on rotten tomatoes.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle game for everyone in the house. Great features with different difficulty levels. My kids love this game and can play this with interest.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My kids and I love iron man, so we decided to try this.  We like it a lot.  Great gear, great graphics.  Nice design.
1936608898|5.0|The most common sensical look at eating that I've ever seen!  I read this book when it was first published and am currently on my 5th Whole 30.  I can honestly say I've never felt better in my life.  Numerous friends, acquaintances and colleagues have commented on my new energy and enthusiasm, all of which I attribute to Melissa and Dallas's philosophy on food.  Thirty-five pounds and two half-marathons later, I can truly say this is a lifestyle change for me.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|Tarantino as usually , tries to shock the audience. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.<br />The acting was brilliant, the story and the idea was good, but the movie falls apart towards the ending. It starts as a very interesting , action movie and it ends up like those Rocky movies from the 80's.<br />My two stars are going only to the actors, which are brilliant.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|use to enjoy this game but with all the changes not fun anymore! chest are scarce and items are next to impossible to win! think u are too controlling of the game! very disappointing!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Totally enjoyed the movie at the theater. Is funny how people don't get the message of the movie. Everybody was looking at the son as a ''crazy one'', while if you study every character in this movie, you will realize that everybody around this young man have mental issues , such as his father which can do anything about betting football, his own friend losing it completely over a failed unhappy marriage and so on. Makes you think twice about the people around you.<br />I really don't take this movie as a comedy. Even it has some very funny moments, still ...just makes me think about some other things.
B00D3NSDVO|3.0|Bogged down in the middle. A good read, however I really had to apply myself mid novel. New there was an Australian connection somewhere.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It Plays very limited content as compare to all other TV sticks plays anything from google TV. I will wait...
B005LLSZNM|5.0|one of my favorite shows! the action and drama is never ending. As soon as one situation is taken care of, another situation pops up.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I really like this little book. True, some of it might seem obvious, but it is well done.<br /><br />I took EST in the seventies (or was it the early eighties) so I know about the value of keeping your agreements and only making agreements that you can keep. It amazes me how most do not and they wonder why their life sucks.<br /><br />Don't take what I just wrote personally. Don't assume that I meant you. I try my best, and perhaps you do as well.
1451695195|5.0|In terms of imagery and sensations, Dr Alexander's NDE falls within the range of those that have been extensively reported. Yet, his story is compelling by virtue of his eminence as a neurosurgeon and his almost miraculous recovery from brain damage. The nature of his illness was such that he could discount the various physiological and biochemical explanations bandied about by the scientific community for the NDE phenomenon. His reflections on the nature of consciousness and the existence of spiritual dimensions are intriguing. What might disappoint, however, are those lessons he purportedly brought back from his encounter with the divine: that love is the basis of the universe, that the existence of evil is necessary for free will and that our lives on Earth are important for our development. These are hardly fresh insights; whether they sound trite or profound depends on one's outlook. In other respects, while Dr. Alexander is adamant that his experience was ultra-real, he does not consider the possibility that it might still be subjective to the individual rather than a world that can be objectively shared with other discarnate human minds. Hence, he accepts the reality of angelic beings and orbs of light. This is not a book that helps you appreciate the range and complexity of NDEs, just the subtlety of one particular NDE. While it is absorbing and thought-provoking, it is simply one tiny piece in the puzzle for the seeker after truth.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a must have app for your G-Box if you, like me, want to get to content on your home networked computer. I made a shared folder called &#34;Media&#34; on my network data drive. ES File explorer is one of the few apps, and the best, to be able to connect to your LAN drives.<br /><br />I had two goals with having a G-Box: 1) get entertainment from Netflix, Ice, and 1 channel, and 2) get content from our computer hard drives. This app make the second one possible.<br /><br />Invaluable.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|great price for the movie, love watching it, our daughter is getting into the princess movies and this is a favorite of hers and mine
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am a great Hobbit fan and, yes, I understand that there are many departures from the book in this movie. Other than a cartoon, this is the only Hobbit movie that I know.<br /><br />I am grateful that Peter jackson has once again applied his genius of story telling, visual richness, and magnificent sound to bring this film to the screen.<br /><br />To the detractors: Show me you movie.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|I found this movie a bit boring.  I enjoyed the first and second videos, but this one just turned me off.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Engrossing story, characters with depth. Enough twists to keep the plot from being predictable. Can't wait to see where all of this takes me.
B009XI7RF6|4.0|This is a fun game, but it does include Flurry Analytics. As an app developer, I've seen a lot of  stuff dealing with Flurry. You can opt your device out of all Flurry tracking here:    [...]    Enjoy
B000GCFG7E|5.0|The last hundred pages are wonderful! You just won't put the book down. But which one should I read next?
B009HEMJCW|4.0|I watched this because it had so many positive reviews, and I'm glad I did.  A super cute movie; the moral isn't heavy-handed.  The acting is solid all around, and the story telling is consistently good. A feel-good movie, for sure.
0345530578|1.0|I see I'm not the only one that found The Racketeer missed the mark.<br /><br />It's always difficult to get fully into a book when the main character isn't very likable, and this book is the classic case in point.  Malcolm Bannister is a lawyer who presumably is bright enough to carry off a rather complex revenge plot, but who stupidly allows his firm to hold millions of dollars \\"accidentally\\" placed in the firm's account. Bannister ends up convicted of racketeering for having accepted these funds, and is sentenced to 10 years in prison. While there his wife leaves him, taking their son. Bannister holds a grudge against the system that put him in jail for a crime he didn't commit and ruined his life. Ok, so that's all logical and makes emotional sense.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!<br />What doesn't make sense is the entire rest of the plot, including, and mostly, Bannister's character.<br /><br />Bannister manages to work a deal that gets him out of prison as a free man by turning in a fellow convict for the unsolved murder of a judge. While Bannister apparently knew of the convict's desire to murder the judge before the crime occurred, he makes no effort to report this to anyone. Once the judge is dead, Bannister congratulates himself on being so smart to have held onto this 'secret' to use to his own advantage.<br /><br />Accepted into the witness protection program, Bannister's primary concern is that the feds aren't smart enough to keep him safe, but he, the attorney that overlooked mysterious millions of dollars in his firm's account, is somehow way more intelligent. Plus, he is annoyed that the feds bought him ugly clothing and don't know how to pick out the right car for his use. He leaves the witness protection program when his cover is blown and the entire rest of the book is a ponderously tedious trudge through Bannister's plot to reclaim his life.<br /><br />The only \\"real\\" relationship Bannister has in this story is with a woman he saw visiting someone else in prison. He obsesses about meeting her, and they do and, oddly, she is fine hooking up with a former convict whose face has been changed through plastic surgery and about whom she knows absolutely nothing. Bannister congratulates himself on finally getting a woman after 5 years without one, and somehow manages to convince her to go along with the overly elaborate and ridiculous plot to regain his life. One is left guessing about her motives since, like almost everyone else in the novel, her thoughts on the situation are left blank.<br /><br />Along with several other people who should know better, Bannister conducts his own version of a sting operation, most of which is so absurd you wouldn't believe me if I wrote it down. In the end, I wound up wishing the drug dealer that Bannister ratted out would successfully find him and do him in, or that the feds would toss his butt back in jail just so I could quit reading. Don't waste your time on this \\"it's all about me\\" guy and unbelievable plot line. The only likable character here is Bannister's retired cop father...too bad we didn't get to hear this story from his point of view.
B002XUL85G|1.0|This was horrible.  It was way too predictable. I enjoyed The old movie series Faces of Death more then this series h& that is saying a lot.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wow, wow and more wow.  Knew very little about Steve Jobs before this book.  A very complex, flawed, and fascinating man.  Lots to think about and chew over for a long time.  A lot of life lessons and cautionary tales all in one.  Very highly recommended.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! It's not scary, just really creepy. Stephen king actually got his inspiration from staying at the Stanley hotel in Colorado for a few months. The real hotel (Stanley) and the fictional hotel (overlook) have a lot of similarities and both are haunted! It really is a great movie and bound to give you the creeps.
0316204366|5.0|Mr. Gladwell never fails to inform, enlighten, and elevated my knowledge and interest in the topics about which he writes.  &#34;David and Goliath&#34; is no different; remarkable people with inspiring, uplifting stories. Insightful.  Well done.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this film. Been a partner in a studio, run my own studio, done live sound and location recording so I've always enjoyed videos about the tech and process of audio recording.<br /><br />This was a fun show with a mix of some techie stuff, a nice sense of what the feel of the studio might have been and a great finale where the Neve &#34;DESK&#34; gets saved and put back into service.<br /><br />If your into recording, either as a musician, studio tech or recording engineer, this is a fun and interesting documentary. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Karl
B0002KZAKS|4.0|You do get what you pay for. If you are wanting this mic for stage/studio performance forget it. Get a good shure. If for karaoke  announcing etc.... Then this will do ok.<br /><br />Please know that it requires as all mics like this phantom power so the negative review from tricky head stating no sound when he hooked xlr to 1/4\\" is because there is no phantom power over a cable like that.<br /><br />Also note that no mic I know of includes cable.<br /><br />Not a bad mic for the price.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Very interesting information on ways to live a more healthy life and loose weight by eating the correct foods.The book gives menus that will help to achieve your goals.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|A day dream.  Hard to relate to characters.  Not real life.  Read this book only if you want to get away from reality
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would recommend this book to  anyone especially parents.  A must read. A solid and accurate depiction of  a  murder trial.
0385537131|4.0|No, John Grisham has found his track again.  Now, unlike many who can read but never can write, I have been tolerant of Grisham's less-than-Grisham Novels. But he can still capture my interest in as few pages as any other current Author.  I either \\"get it\\" or \\"buy into spending time with a book\\" in the first few pages...at least in the first chapter.  John G. has his groove back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it makes me think not to go on the train tracks. It also is very fun because you can sometimes climb up on tunnels,dodge trains, jump to get special prizes, walk on top of trains and change characters and hoverboards.
0307352153|4.0|Good information on the value, advantage and power associated with being one of the quiet (introverted) ones, whether you are the introvert or not.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I first got this game I played it like crazy and its the coolest thing ever most people will usually just say oh ewes it's all pony but this entertaining game has kept me up almost all night  you should all get it and I'm 13 so that basically is how awesome my little pony is!!!!!!!!!!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I grew up watching Wizard of Oz and I knew I would have to add this movie to my collection.  Despite the varied reviews I loved it!
B003008RWA|4.0|Although filmed in 2007, this movie is still very relevant.  Really makes you think about our own healthcare in the U.S.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|The movie is not terrible, but I too would have been disappointed had I spent movie ticket prices to see it. Jaden was a poor choice and Will was under utilize; and this director has probably directed only one movie I thought was remotely close to being worth movie ticket prices. My advice rent and see what all the moaning is about. You'll get it, you'll be somewhat entertained, and you'll see what happens when good concept, not original by any means, never quite finds it's walking shoes
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can open doors, plant plants, and kill animals for food, the king of England plays it. And it is the most popular game on kindle fire!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Highly addictive!!  Tons of fun and I am HAPPY that it is finally available for my Kindle. I may have to find that Candy Crush rehab place!!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started playing this game two days ago. Not really understanding the whole gist of it yet, but I like it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This thing is so cool I am already on level 14 and hoping number 15.I hope you love it because I do.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun makes u use your  brain an concentrate great. For quite time when the. Kids are sleeper makes my eyes sharp 2 I'm not patient tho so I hate waiting for energy to build back up
B007TK77QE|4.0|I liked almost all the book very much. Almost…  The book was definitely worth reading for me. I found the characters believable, the little town vividly described and the plot interestingly developing, but… And I wouldn't tell more because of the possibility of spoilers.
B009MYARIK|5.0|loved it. full of hijinks reminiscent of the shopaholic series. a great laugh out loud read and easy to get into.
B001RJTFP4|5.0|An absolute, creative, entertaining, fast paced, vampire classic.  Its a must-watch.<br /><br />If you're yearning for a good story line, action, and even a little humor, just rent it already.  Its great.  The only reason you'd even be slightly disappointed is if....  no, nevermind, I can't think of a single reason not to love this movie.<br /><br />Oh, and wait until you meet Pearl....... ::shivers in disgust::
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Excellent book about excellent software. Easy to read and explains all the features in an easy to understand language. I have almost all of Scott's  books and love his writing stile and practical approach.
B00B5D32XS|4.0|If you liked season one, chances are you will like this too, if for nothing more than the incredible acting of our beloved familiar faces.  Most of the original cast is back, with a unique spin that I have seen no other series do...  make a completely new storyline, complete with new characters and timelines, but use the same cast from season 1.  It worked, its great.  I was skeptical for the first episode, then just loved it more and more.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Another great season of stand-alone stories interspersed with serial-type content. The cliff-hangers in this series are some of the best I've seen.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It kept me on my toes the whole time and couldn't have asked for a more satisfying ending. Great character development.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Such a fun show. Hubby and I went through all the seasons in a matter of weeks and looking forward to the next one. The dialogue is quick and stories are good (sometimes there's an occasional WTH?) and they're not hard to look at.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun and the whole family likes it. Beautiful graphics fun little bonuses and goals to keep you working.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I saw this season last year and ended up watching it again with my husband.  Now we're both in sync and actually recording the show weekly so we can keep up.  That's a rarity for us. The relationships are dynamic and the writing is quick.  Very entertaining.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Big fan of Bill Bryson...<br />Great book.<br />Not surprising... What can you expect  from the author of 'Mother Tongue', 'Mother Tongue' and 'At Home'?<br />Great writer!
B001NLL93W|3.0|It's the best in the series but..... a bit disappointing story for whom love Valentine. It's nice book to kill your time.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This would have been five stars except for an episode that had a deus ex machina ending; an unexplained return and rescue. My rating should be 4.75. Excellent writing. Fine performances. I was glad to finally catch up with it after having seen the movie Serenity which I found to be excellent. I rewatched the movie after seeing the series and enjoyed it in a richer way.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Stick with it as the rewards are many. Where does each turn we take each choice we make take us. How do we make the best choices or do we? Great story enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks Kindle for adding it to your list of games, this is a very challenging game and I enjoy playing it.
B00368PSN2|5.0|Being a fan of Jim Caviezel from Person of Interest, one of my favorite shows, and being a Sci-Fi buff, I took a chance on this one. I don't like watching movies too much by myself, I find the experience better when my wife is watching the film with me, so I waited for the first Sunday when I knew we would be together (due to our sometimes conflicting schedules). I was really kept on the edge of my seat. At first, it looked like it was a little slow getting into it, but it wasn't for long. Most films are like that anyway. The story of how Jim Caviezel gets to the year 709 is revealed to you bit by bit  as the story unfolds, so don't think you will miss out on that. I won't go into the details, only that this is one really good film. You almost forget it is a science fiction film. If you liked Aliens, you will also love this one. Buy it, watch it, you won't be disappointed. The special effects are also great. I loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great!  Does everything it says it will.  I Think this product is a sign of things to come.  Needs more apps that are compatible.
B000002OTK|5.0|It's an amazing vinyl. This is one of the best soundtracks I ever listen to, If you have the chance, buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the most amazing thing on earth. The first best is the hunger games. It was so surprising at the end when Gale said there is no district 12. It made me wonder where Prim and Katniss`s mom  we're. I can't wait to read the next book. And the movies.
B007EECSFA|2.0|I couldn't finish the book.  I loved her other book, The Forgotten Garden, but could not get into this one.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love all of Diana Gabaldon's books in the Outlander series, but so far this one is my favorite!  I am looking forward to the release of her next book in 2014.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It’s books like this that make it hard to write a review spoiler free. Anytime I try to formulate a sentence I just have one thing I want to say… and I can’t.<br /><br />I started the Divergent series straight off the heels of The Hunger Games trilogy. Prior to reading that, I had only read a handful of YA so I was desperate to find something that made me feel like The Hunger Games did. Luckily, it took me no time as my local bookstore had Divergent labeled as “If you liked The Hunger Games try this…”. I dove into Divergent and fell completely in love with it. I had no idea it was the first book in a trilogy when I picked it up, but lucky for me I had waited so long to fall in love with YA that Insurgent was just days away from release. I had no idea that this trilogy would do things to my heart the way it did. I have loved AND hated the same character from one book to another, I have cried and I have screamed and it’s so entirely weird to me that this is how It ends. It’s done… and I don’t know how to sum into words the catastrophic event that my heart just happened to go through in the prior hours.<br /><br />I am going to keep this spoiler free as possible, for Allegiant. Divergent and Insurgent spoilers will be inevitable so if you haven’t read those two yet, I suggest stopping now. I have linked to Goodreads at the end, so list a few additional thoughts in a spoiler tag.<br /><br />Tris, quite possibly, might be one of the strangest written characters for me. I loved her in Divergent, just adored her. I thought she was strong, but emotional, kind but tough… and I just really liked and appreciated her for her qualities. I practically detested her in Insurgent. I hated her whinyness, and her inability to think about anyone but herself and probably the biggest reason was for the way she constantly hurt Four. Well, I loved her all over again in Allegiant. She was almost entirely back to the Tris I fell in love with in Divergent and I have tothank Veronica Roth for giving me back the heroine that originally made me love this series. Surprisingly, Four who I have consistently loved from book to book was the character that I wasn’t to scream at. He seemed so irrational in Allegiant at times and it more than frustrated me. He did come to be the Four I loved again, but… I didn’t much enjoy that I spent a large part of the book being angry with him. Christina, will always be a favorite of mine and I have liked her consistently throughout the series. Uriah and Zeke were two of my favorites from the beginning of the series, and they might be two of the characters I am saddest to leave. I loved their personalities and how they played an equally important part to both Tris and Four.<br /><br />For the first 25% of Allegiant I thought it was very good, fast paced and it held my attention. Then the next 55% of the book was so slow-paced that I honestly expected I would have to put it down for good… well, I reached a certain point at the end where my entire stomach region may have, in fact, been lodged into my throat so for that, Veronica Roth, kudos to you because only excellent writing can do that to a person.<br /><br />I LOVED the dual point of view. The fact that we could view this story from both Tris & Tobias’s eyes was fantastic. I think it wouldn’t have had as big of an impact on me if it wasn’t for that. I especially loved Tobias’s voice. It especially becomes import with the dual point of view towards the end of story and I think Roth made an excellent choice by writing like this.<br /><br />One of my biggest disappointments of Allegiant was the predictibility. I had somewhat of an idea or expectation where the story was going to go after Insurgent. I really loved the ending of the second book, but I had this idea in my mind what was going to happen and I wasn’t entirely wrong. I also wanted MORE. I felt starved of an amazing story when I finished and that is probably my biggest problem with the ending. I mean, Roth took this book where I’m sure no one thought it would go, I sure as hell didn’t at least and I HATED THAT. I think she achieved a shock value and surprise that we may not see again for a very long time but I hated the way she did it. The actual event that takes place is not even the part that bothers me … it’s the way it was done. I don’t think it did the characters, or the series the justice it deserves.<br /><br />I enjoyed the epilogue however, and that did actually cast Allegiant in a better light for me but I’m sad to say that I was expecting a bit more from the ending of one of my favorite series and I didn’t get it.<br /><br />My review is impossible to sum up my feelings, I also don’t think that you should hold my review in much regard when it comes to Allegiant. If you started this series, you should finish it… and keep an open mind. You may love the ending, you may hate it… or you may be a bit put off like me. It’s worth it to see how Tris & Four’s story ends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book, especially the ending, strange as that sounds. This is because I have had a very similar experience, in my life.

B00C2IGQBA|5.0|This is the first comic book to motion picture done right.  It had all the right ingredients for the movie to succeed. Good script, actors, director, and the people behind the scenes that made Batman possible. Spanning 10 years in development,  and in the end, it worked. This version of the film is great,  it has all the extras from the anthology collection,  and comes in a steel book case. Great for fans and movie enthusiasts,  go get it.

B000051YD6|5.0|This pair of recordings from the 1980's appears to have been remastered using the 24bit 96kHz technology although there isn't a word about it anywhere in the sleeve notes. However the sleeve design is consistent with that and careful comparison between this disc and the previous CD brings an added sense of bite and clarity in line with such mastering. It has to be said that, in this case, the differences are very small and that is using rather sophisticated playback equipment to check.<br /><br />Therefore if the main interest in this issue is focussed on improvements of sound over the very good originals, I would suggest that there is not sufficient to warrant further outlay.<br /><br />However ... the attraction of this disc over the original issues is the extra playing time. The fifth concerto originally did not have a partner and now it has acquired a matching concept of the fourth concerto so what was short time is now generous and both are striking readings of authority.<br /><br />These readings are a step back in time in so far as they are definitely large scale beyond anything that Beethoven would have anticipated in terms of the scale of orchestral and piano sound and power. Those familiar with the Kovacevich recordings, also with Davis conducting, will notice a considerable increase of weight and generally much steadier tempi on Arrau's disc. This may be partly to do with the newer recording but mostly it is to do with the concept of the two readings. These are definitely well out of the Classical period and moving towards Brahms as a sound. Those familiar with Arrau will not be surprised and it must be observed that these have absolutely nothing in common with current thinking as regards Classical period style.<br /><br />Having said all of that, and it is very relevant in terms of what potential purchasers ought to expect, these two readings mark the culmination of a lifetime's experience and thinking by one of the greatest pianists of his generation. Arrau has not moved with the times but has honed his interpretations and his vision to a remarkable degree and as such it is a very satisfying experience to hear. In those ways these performances could almost be described as timeless and I would suggest that, remarkably, they transcend considerations of period style. They are essentially things of considerable beauty as well as offering substantial weight and authority.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this disc is well worth considering, even by those with period performance preferences such as myself for example. Because of its variance from current performing understanding of this period, I would suggest that it would be best bought as an alternative to other more central readings of which there are numerous good examples now available.<br /><br />In those terms this disc occupies its place on my shelves with easy authority but it would not be a recording that I would use to illustrate Beethoven as Beethoven would have expected as we now understand it. However, this disc still qualifies as one of the Great Recordings as described on the front and back covers.rrau has not moved with the times but has honed his interpretations and his vision to a remarkable degree and as such it is a very satisfying experience to hear.

B006GWO5NE|2.0|I bought this about a month ago, and already it will not charge my Kindle Fire HD, I do not know why it is in the same place it has always been. I have bought many others that were not from Kindle and I thought if I got the one made for my Kindle it would last longer but it did not. I even moved it to another plug on my power bar just to see if it was the plug. It still did not work everything else on the power bar works fine.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great clock, like the sleep sound feature and the choice of clock types.  Best clock for the price at only .99!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|The game is great for anyone who loves Angry Birds and the Star Wars saga. My children love this game not only because they can choose the bird or the pork side or their own characters, but because they can watch short video clips about the pigs and birds in the Toons TV, which is part of the game. I don't even know what my son loves more: the game or the short videos. He is looking forward watching these new cartoons that are being created and released every Sunday.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I rather enjoy this game. It provides the user with quite a challenge. However, not only is it challenging, it is also very fun.
030758836X|4.0|Enjoyed the ride - even though the ending was somewhat too contrived in my opinion. Maybe not contrived, just plain too unbelievable. Great read anyway.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is riveting and was such a joy to read. It follows the lives of characters both good and bad in great detail. I had a hard time putting it down and I'm sad to see it end.<br />I love the timeframe and Ken Follet is amazing with painting a picture so vividly you feel your right there with them.<br />A must read!

B001MM28JG|5.0|Galaxy Quest is one of the best Star Trek inspired movies ever. Every single actor is perfect in this movie... every one. The writing is excellent, and everything comes together to deliver one of the most delightful cinematic experiences.<br /><br />The only way Galaxy Quest could be better is if they had made a sequel! Which I'm still holding out for one day!

B002RSOTSM|5.0|Rear Window is without a doubt quintessentially Hitchcock.  Visually sensual and deeply rich with a gripping engaging plot that is impossible to look away from.  James Stewart, Grace Kelley, and the rest of the cast provide a sophistication that is worldly and reflects the melting pot culture of New York.  Edith Head's designs for Kelley elevate the entire atmosphere.  Beautiful cinema.
B000TETLPC|5.0|Amazing album. 3rd time I've bought it in various formats. In my opinion the best APC album.  Needed a digital copy on my phone to get through the work day

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this everyday. Was recovering from a surgery and it gave me something to do! I have something to do while waiting for appointments. I find it easier on my Kindle than phone.
B00A5MRFU6|5.0|When KafKa died, this novel, on which he had already stopped working for a few years, was left unfinished.  It actually ends in mid-sentence!<br /><br />The reader is told nothing of the internal thoughts of the protagonists, of their real motivations and objectives. There is no resolution to the multiple questions that arise from the plot.  In fact, as the same events are often reported very differently by various characters, the reader is led to ponder about the relativity of truth.<br /><br />Though challenging in its substance, this novel is easy to grasp and fully enjoyable.<br /><br />It is strongly recommended to all who enjoy modernity.

B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I'm not a hardcore Korn fan by any means. I'm 16, and have throughout my life heard many Korn songs. While I liked them all, I never owned any of their albums, nor did I ever pursue them. I was more into Rob Zombie and Slipknot kind of kid. I knew that Brian Head Welch had left the band, and was pretty excited to see he was going to be working with Korn on the new album. I felt bad for all the flack they had been catching, and was eager to see if they could capture that old sound. Boy, did they ever. They even added some electronic influence in there. The guitar riffs, while being simple and used receptively (in a good way), are sludgy and well integrated. The bass(especially at the beginning of \\"Love and Meth\\") is well balanced and integrated. The drums are the same as all the other instruments, well integrated and fitting. The glue that holds it all together, though, are Jonathan Davis' vocals, which are at their best. In short, whether you're a hardcore Korn fan, or a casual listener of anything metal, you need to give this one a try. 9.85/10

B008JFUNYG|1.0|This movie was really a huge disappoint for me. After seeing the trailers with the obvious notion of \\"Evil Dead\\" being done with actual money (let's face it-the original is fun, the special effects weren't even good for it's time), it looked good. I have no idea what anyone was thinking when they churned out this piece of garbage.<br /><br />For one thing, any evil dead knows about the mysterious evil monster that is in the woods at all times. It was creepy and errie. Here is reduced to lasting all about a few minutes and once it \\"possesses\\" the main girl, it never shows up again. Um, what?<br /><br />Then they remove any potential humor from the film. Let's face it-the entire Evil Dead franchise had a sense of humor, with total overuse of squirting blood, to crawling hands, etc. The morons playing the tape while one girl is like \\"shut it off.\\" They didn't even play a tape, this random guy thinks it's a good idea to read English translations? Um...it would've been better if this guy was a student in a Latin class and read it, but in English?<br /><br />It's like a film that cuts every corner to try to be different, only to turn out to be stale. The basement in this movie is so foul, way more than the original, and yet, it is horribly underused.<br /><br />The \\"forest is alive and ready to do bad things\\" scene is done we'll, yet is also underwhelming. It's kind of sad thinking they basically had to play with trees to get this to work in the original, and here there is obvious CGI.<br /><br />The original \\"Evil Dead\\" really had something going for it, even with the bad special effects. The particular ending scene where Bruce Campbell aka \\"Ash\\" undoes the curse and the demons break out of the people with the hands could've really added some much needed pizazz to this film, but it's absent.<br /><br />The movie also seems half-written for one direction and another direction, considering it cannot even figure out whom the main character is. First it's the girl, then it'sher boyfriend, but somehow the girl is saved? I mean, why? Just let everyone die who is cursed, the beginning of the film pretty much said that, yet the film doesn't even follow through on it's own story. It is poorly written on top of being bland.<br /><br />When there is gore, it works. Some of it is over-the-top. Might be the movies only real succession.<br /><br />This is a remake to avoid at all costs. Just go watch Evil Dead 2 if your itching to see another version of \\"Evil Dead\\" (since it seems more like a more expensive remake than a sequel). I have watched a lot of remakes and not understood why there is so much hatred, yet people actually seem to like this one? Really? This is crap. It really is. If you want to see a film like this that actually works go watch \\"Cabin In The Woods\\" instead, it may not have the intense gore but it has the humor...

They do some interesting things with the characters and plot, but never go far with it mainly trusting its special effects to do the entertaining.  It's not bad, but it's not great either--if there were, there would be more.

B00ACBN9CI|3.0|Better control than other flight sims by this author but the game play still lacks contest. The challenge seems to be to chase the little red arrows 'till they turn to boxes, then lay on the gun button 'till the bullets are gone - wait for bullet reload. Repeat process. Not fun. The planes are nicely rendered and displayed. As for the environment, there's blue sky, clouds and sand-colored ground, presumably the dessert. This app strikes me as being a salvage from the game consoles at the video parlors of yesteryear. There's the mandatory &quot;external view&quot; of the aircraft, lots of spinning and jet-like thunder and flying red boxes, arrows, radio voice from base followed by more spinning, jet-like thunder... well, you get the picture.<br /><br />I keep forgetting. This is a Kindle Fire HD, not a PS4 game station. My fault.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|As a new player of Candy Crush Saga, I am frustrated beyond words.  I am a compulsive and reasonably intelligent person.  However, I am a Taurus and therefore stubborn.  I will not pay to advance in this game.  I am on level 35 and can not advance because I can not achieve 280,000 points.  Is it possible without purchasing boosters?<br /><br />If there are 400 levels, think how much this could cost over time!  I would have  gladly paid  for this &quot;free&quot; game without the built in obstacles that prevent advancement.<br /><br />I highly recommend as an alternative, Fruit Drops.  To me it is more challenging because there are three goals___points, moves, and time.  Although it costs 99 cents, it is well worth the money and you can win!

B003AQCAZE|1.0|In the remake, inserting the conversation Han has with Jabba completely deflates the urgency of Han's story arc.  Jabba let's Han off the hook for the debt so there is no longer any dire consequence.  The scene also deflates Jabba as a threat.  In the remake, the audience sees that Jabba actually likes Han and in doing, Jabba is seen as an easy pushover and just a big blob that is NO THREAT WHATSOEVER!  It's screenwriting 101 and Lucas messed it up.

044020271X|1.0|There aren't many books written by Belva Plain that I haven't read yet.  Usually her books are written wonderfully and held my interest to the point that I wouldn't be able to read another great story by Belva.  This one however, did not do it for me.  Couldn't get into a slow, boring story at all.  Didn't even finish it.  Sorry.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Suspenseful and creative, even with all the zombie movies out there.  Really good special effects and Brad was good too!

1451666179|5.0|It's ridiculous and painfully honest and hilarious and doggies and if you were smart enough to get the dead tree version, is ALL THE RAINBOWS when looking at it from the side.<br /><br />If you like dogs, simple or otherwise, those chapters are tastier than bees. If you've ever been Depressed (not just a little bit sad, but clinically Depressed), or know someone who has been, you will understand a little better that whole dynamic.<br /><br />If you've ever been or had a child determined to be the Cake God, you will laugh over those escapades.  Allie Brosh is clearly no Renoir nor even Picasso, but the crude MS Paint drawings are wonderfully expressive and charming in their own way.<br /><br />It very clearly states \\"features new material and selections from HyberboleandaHalf.blogspot.com,\\" and you know, it didn't bug me at all that some of the material I'd read on the blog already; I liked revisiting it.<br /><br />From me it gets ALL THE STARS.

1476727651|1.0|The book had no redeeming characteristics. Every character seemed to have an awful history, such as the girl raped by her father who now suggests dates with men in bars so she can use her POWERS to make them sleep, rob them, and slice up their face with her knife. And she wasn't one of the evil people, either! Another thing that bothered me was that he characterized Reagan as \\"untrustworthy\\".  Reagan spent eight years in office with a growing economy and never got us into any wars, so I think he was OK. I don't care if a fiction author has political leanings that don't agree with mine, but he should avoid propagandizing his opinions in a fictional work. I have bought every book King ever wrote, but I will never buy another.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought this book was very informative about the heinous part of our country's history when orphans were treated like slaves. It certainly made me appreciate the Department of Family Services which although not perfect gives some system of checks for children who are not able to live with their families. I liked the way the author of Orphan Train juxtaposed the modern foster parent program with the system of bouncing children from one unpleasant situation to another used during the orphan train days. The orphans in the book were certainly survivors. There were times in the book when circumstances seemed to fit together almost too miraculously for reality, but it made a wonderful story in spite of the tragic circumstances endured by the orphans.

B008JFURF6|4.0|It's another time-traveling trip for the Smurfs (though thankfully not in the same fashion as the dreaded final season of the Smurfs cartoon show that pulled its plug), but this time it's to rescue Smurfette, who seems to be having issues over who's her real family -- the Smurfs or her creator Gargamel with his new creations, the Naughties. Again Gargamel is after the Smurfs for stealing their essence to power up his magic (instead of his usual purpose of making the Philosopher's Stone as in the comic books and the cartoon show), and again we have the Winslows along for the ride, this time with their son Blue and Patrick's stepfather Victor Doyle for the respective additions of charm and embarrassment. Throughout the story, Smurfette, Patrick Winslow, and the Naughties get to learn the lesson that family isn't about who brought you into this world, but who really cares for you as a person and who wants to see you grow as a person. Besides this, the movie still has its share of laughs from the previous movie, even if the number of Smurfs that appear in it is still limited to the five that are the main focus of the story, with the others (such as the former leads Brainy and Gutsy) having minor or even cameo roles.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the movie series, which is now being cancelled in favor of an all-CGI reboot by Sony Pictures, the time-traveling Smurfs-in-the-modern-world story aspect is perhaps in my book its biggest failing, as though the production crew has to rely on that kind of story to justify the budget they were given to create a good live-action/CGI-animated movie of a lesser scope than Peter Jackson's interpretation of the J.R.R. Tolkien Hobbit/Lord Of The Rings medieval fantasy series. Once was pretty much enough, and twice was pushing it. Hopefully with the reboot the Smurfs will be brought back to having stories taking place solely in the medieval fantasy Europe world that they came from, but who knows?

B0000549B0|4.0|Read other reviews and product description to find out the story line. Harvey is one of my favorite movies. The single disc full screen is fine if you are looking to just watch for the story. I've gotten use to watching the movie filling the TV screen so I was disappointed that I didn't pay more attention to the fact it was only full screen. I thought parts of the film weren't as crisp that they were a little fuzzy like when you watch a VCR homemade tape. I will watch for a remastered form.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Love them. I only wish that the cables were a bit longer. These definitely work much better than the previous white cables that easily frayed.
1451648545|4.0|Few works of non-fiction have been as eagerly anticipated and commercially successful as Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs,” which hit bookstores a mere 13 days after the iconic tech leader succumbed to cancer in October 2011.  Despite its blockbuster status, reviews were somewhat mixed, which (in my opinion) is inevitable when a biography appears on a contemporary and controversial figure.  Among those most displeased, I learned, were those closest to Jobs, believing that Isaacson was excessively harsh on the famously arrogant and prickly Apple CEO.<br /><br />Personally, I really enjoyed this book, although it is far from perfect.  I live in Silicon Valley and have worked in the tech industry for over a decade, including with many people who were close friends of Jobs and some of whom who were tossed overboard by him (“bozos”, in other words, according to Jobs).  My gut feeling is that “Steve Jobs” rings incredibly true, capturing the legitimate genius and deep character flaws of the subject.  Isaacson should be commended for producing an extensive, original and genuinely objective piece on someone who was legendary for creating a “reality distortion field.”  Indeed, Isaacson notes that Jobs frequently flattered and cajoled him to promote the latest Apple product when the author was a senior editor at TIME magazine.<br /><br />Although Isaacson doesn’t lay it out this way, there are three core elements to this book:  1) it is a history of the digital revolution that exploded out of Silicon Valley in the 1970s and 80s and which Jobs did much to create and shape; 2) it highlights a fundamental and serious question about the focus of technology businesses today, not just the open versus closed system debate, but more importantly the product and design first mindset of senior leadership versus those with an engineering or sales perspective; and 3) there is the subject of Steve Jobs himself, a fascinating and enigmatic personality, one who could keep a platoon of psychoanalysts busy for years.<br /><br />First, this book is a history of the personal computer industry and the revolutions that Jobs led in everything from digital music to smart phones and tablets to computer animation and retailing.  Many of the leading figures of the information age play pivotal roles in this enthralling story, including Bill Gates and Larry Ellison (neither of whom need an introduction), Arthur Rock and Michael Moritz (two of the Valley’s most legendary venture capitalists), and Bill Campbell (to this day one of the most influential coaches to entrepreneurs).  The history of the birth and growth of the personal computer industry that Isaacson tells could almost stand on its own.<br /><br />Second, I am currently living and wrestling with the legacy of Jobs’ influence on the technology industry.  A major theme of this biography is Steve Jobs’ intense belief that hardware and software should be designed to work together.  Others (most notably Bill Gates) pursued a different path, an open system that allowed various hardware manufacturers to use various software products.  In retrospect, Gates and Microsoft were proven right, at least in the short run (i.e. 1985-2000).  Microsoft’s “open” model utterly crushed Apple’s “closed” system, and Bill Gates became the world’s wealthiest man in the process.  But once Jobs returned to his company in 1997 and began to launch a succession of epoch making products in the 2000s (iPod, iTunes, Apple Retail, iPhone, iPad), his view on the benefits of an “integrated” (a word he preferred over “closed”) product offering were clear against the “fragmented” (his word for “open”) competition.  But perhaps more than anything else, Jobs believed that the most important part of running a company was creating truly great products, and thus ensuring that the designers and artists were in control, not the MBAs.  (He believed that Microsoft was doomed so long as salesman SteveBallmer was in control; I think he’s absolutely right.)  For Jobs design wasn’t an aspect of the finished product, it WAS the finished product: “Design was not about what a product looked like on the surface.  It had to reflect the product’s essence,” he was fond of saying.  Profits and the like would naturally follow if you created truly awesome product experiences.  And, in his opinion, most technology product experiences “sucked.”  I work for a large and successful software company in Silicon Valley and I can attest that we are slowly but steadily and refreshingly embracing the worldview that Jobs trumpeted over his career.  Our focus on the product experience and our willingness to take revenue risks to preserve a better design and customer experience are, I believe, directly tied back to the philosophy and example of Steve Jobs.  It is a philosophy that he never once wavered from, even when, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it looked like it was flawed and doomed.<br /><br />Finally, there is Steve Jobs the man, the flesh-and-blood human being, and that’s where things with this book get tricky.  I’ve read many biographies over the years (my Amazon review profile will demonstrate that) and only two have left me with a sour taste in my mouth about the subject: Swanberg’s “Citizen Hurst” about William Randolph Hurst and this one.<br /><br />There’s no doubt that Steve Jobs was a genius, a legend, an icon.  Isaacson writes “History will place him in the pantheon right next to Edison and Ford” – and who could disagree?  But the man Isaacson describes isn’t someone you might want to have a beer with, let alone work for.<br /><br />Jobs became famous (not to mention famously wealthy) before he was 25, yet he somehow managed to live a lot before all that happened.  And most of that living was irresponsible, dissolute and heavily drugged, as he sought personal enlightenment through acid, various Eastern religions and extreme vegan diets, some of which evidently pushed him to death’s door while still in his teens.  His first work experience was at Atari, where he showed up randomly one day, demanded a job, got it, and then arrived for work each day thereafter barefooted, obnoxious, foul smelling, and often fixing people with an uncomfortable, Rasputin-like stare.  The image that Isaacson paints of the young Jobs, which I have no doubt is highly accurate, is far from flattering.  In fact, you want to punch him in the throat.<br /><br />It’s one thing to be rebellious and uncouth adolescent.  It’s another to be a petulant, ungrateful, and emotionally abusive son.  Your heart bleeds for Paul and Clara Jobs, the humble but dignified working class parents who adopted him, supported him, loved him, even coddled him, reinforcing his life long view that he was “special.”  His father taught Steve that the details are important.  A central anecdote from the biography is how father and son built a fence around their modest Los Altos home when Steve was young and his father stressed that it was important that the pieces of wood you would never see should still be well crafted, even beautiful.  Jobs embraced this mindset throughout life.  One senses that Jobs truly loved his dad (there is one touching scene of Jobs on his deathbed, shriveled and frail, whispering that his father was “a great man”), even though he was frequently cold and cruel to him despite all that he gave him and sacrificed for him, one of the big failings of this book for me was that the author does not really probe the father-son relationship too deeply and for some reason completely fails to mention Paul Jobs’ death in the early 1990s, just as NeXT was imploding, and how it affected his son.<br /><br />From beginning to end, the central theme that Isaacson develops about Steve Jobs is that of a highly emotional, often unstable and possibly bi-polar man who ricocheted with unsettling irregularity from tender and lugubrious son/friend/lover/colleague to cold, vindictive, and heartless tormentor.  Perhaps the most insightful perspective Jobs’s character came from a former girlfriend, who was convinced he was stricken with something called Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  Such individuals “have a sense of entitlement and demonstrate grandiosity in their beliefs and behavior. They have a strong need for admiration, but lack feelings of empathy. These qualities are usually defenses against a deep feeling of inferiority and of being unloved.”<br /><br />The most damning revelation about Jobs, in my opinion, has to do with something rather mundane and trivial: throughout his life Jobs never put a license plate on his car and usually parked in handicapped spaces, sometimes two at a time.  To me, there is something about that which is deeply disturbing.  I feel the truth in Bill Gates’ uncharitable observation that Jobs was “weirdly flawed as a human being.”  As Isaacson tells it, there was something most definitely “off” about Steve Jobs, an arrogance, selfishness, and basic lack of empathy that makes him so off-putting.  Isaacson provides a few memorable quotes that support this observation.  A few of my favorite are: “When I look into most people’s eyes, I see a soul.  When I look into your eyes, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole, a dead zone” (Leezy Scully); “…his integrity I cannot trust” (Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak); and “…it hurts when he takes credit for one of my designs” (lead Apple designer Jony Ive).<br /><br />Yet, this biography falls short for me on the subject of his character.  I simply cannot reconcile the portrait of Jobs that Isaacson paints with the man who was close and long term friends with men who are so unlike him: the colossally materialistic Larry Ellison; the garrulous, profane and backslapping former football coach Bill Campbell; the archconservative Rupert Murdoch.  How could the Jobs that Isaacson describes here be close friends with these men?  In the case of Ellison and Campbell for over decades and genuinely brotherly close?  Bill Campbell has said he has not and will not read this book because of what he’s heard about it, how Isaacson so unfairly pilloried one of his dearest friends.  Something about that, from a man known for honesty and connecting with people, gives me pause and prevents me from swallowing whole the author’s biographical narrative.<br /><br />For all of his character flaws, Jobs was a visionary and an artist – and one who happened to be an amazing businessman.  One of things that amazed me was how passionate and hardworking he was.  Jobs was deeply immersed in all elements of Apple’s business, not just only hardware and software design, for which he is rightly famous, but also marketing (e.g. he reviewed, approved, and often drove all advertising campaigns), business development (e.g. he was the lead negotiator with the music companies on iTunes and even with suppliers like Dow, which provided the “gorilla glass” for the iPhone), and operations (e.g. he picked out the specific slate stonework for Apple Retail stores).  Let there be no doubt: Steve Jobs was one of the hardest working, most passionate and committed CEOs imaginable.<br /><br /> Isaacson concludes “Steve Jobs” with a succinct and accurate observation of the man and the products he made: “His passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession for control were integrally connected to his approach to business and the products that resulted.”  But no one can do better justice to his philosophy and worldview than the extensive autobiographical postlude written by the man himself in the concluding chapter of this book.  Heartfelt, insightful, penetrating, sincerely profound, but above all simple, clear and succinct, just like his products.  His own words stand as the ultimate testament to who he was and what he believed in and stood for.ets, some of which evidently pushed him to death’s door while still in his teens.

0738737909|4.0|I first became aware of the Tarot Illuminati through Facebook a couple of years ago. What caught my eye was the decadent image of the High Priestess which graced the cover of the Tarosophist International winter 2011 issue. As I now glance over the Tarot Illuminati Facebook page, words like \\"beautiful,\\" \\"breathtaking,\\" \\"gorgeous,\\" \\"magical,\\" and \\"stunning\\" pop out from reviews and thank-yous posted by this deck's adoring fans.<br /><br />This tour de force, designed by Erik C. Dunne with a companion book by Kim Huggens and published by Lo Scarabeo, blitzed the tarot world card by blingy card as Erik unveiled the deck slowly over a year and a half, a steady curtain call of the glitz and glamour, bright lights and show stopping spectacle of a Broadway blockbuster.<br /><br />Of course, I've always been more of an Off-Off girl, seeking out the tiny black box theatres with dull costumes, no set, and meaty, intense characters who challenge my world view, take me into the depths of my understanding of reality and re-weave the fabric of my being. Like a big Broadway musical, this full-voiced deck overwhelms my senses with one big production number after another. I'm yearning for a quiet scene, a whispered aside, the melancholy ballad. My question as I flip through the cards is: can this jewel box oracle get in my black box brain and speak to me?<br /><br />On the shelf the Tarot Illuminati box is exquisitely presented in a peacock spectrum of blues and greens, overlaid with antiqued gold rays extending from a vesica piscis which frames the incomparable High Priestess image in her subtle shading of cool blues and lavender. She is arrayed in a luxury of texture from diaphanous chiffons to patterned jacquards, from draping silks and glimmering satins to heavy velvet. Her chain mail girdle and cuffs contrast with her feathery, pleated headdress behind the crescent curves of her hammered silver Isis crown. Intricate silver metalwork falls from her jeweled belt while above her armored midriff and below her cowled neck she opens her sacred, ancient scroll. The photo realism of face and hands--remote disdain and cutting cheekbones above grasping fingers--brings an almost unnatural human presence to this fantasy image.<br /><br />The many-layered costume and heavily made-up features all speak to a veiling and complexity of her truth, despite the fact that she holds her scroll open to the viewer. We remember that words are also a veil for truth and we approach a possible understanding of the image.<br /><br />Inside the durable box--the nicest kind with a magnetic flap closure--we are again greeted with the same image on the cover of the 160-page full-color book. The deck itself is nestled comfortably in a perfectly sized cubbyhole with a bright yellow satin ribbon that easily lifts the deck from its snug home.<br /><br />The cards are very thick with gilded edges and the card backs feature an opulent gold metalwork pattern over the peacock blues of the box and book cover. I have heard reports of sticky cards, which I think is a common and forgivable side effect of the gilding process. The cards are too thick to riffle shuffle, and certainly you wouldn't want to treat this art piece like a working deck. Overhand shuffling is smooth and effective and allows you to trance out on the beautiful and reversible card backs.<br /><br />The cards are a standard size, approximately 2 ¾ x 4 ¾ inches, and borderless with a brief banner across the bottom declaring the card title. All the titles are traditional with the exception of the substitution of the Alchemist for the Magician. The riotous colors are so overwhelming as to beg for a border that might bring consistency to a spread. Normally I prefer borderless decks, but this seems to crave something to tone it down and give it some structure.<br /><br />The artwork itself is well-executed digital illustration and photo collage. I have always found that contrasting photographic backgrounds and peoplewith computer generated props and costumes undermines my suspension of disbelief--I find greater verisimilitude in images that let go of the real world and embrace their own unique mise-en-scene.<br /><br />My favorite cards in the deck tend toward the cool end of the color spectrum and aren't overproduced, sticking to simpler images rather than busy symbolism that doesn't give the eye a place to rest.<br /><br />The Princess of Swords in the full skirts and ruffled collar of her Elizabethan gown (the suit of Swords features a cast from the Elizabethan period) stands in the grass beneath a craggy cliff topped with a wind-swept tree. Five seagulls lift up and away against cloudy gray skies. The wind tangles her hip-length red hair as a lace scarf blows around her. She looks up at the sword lifted in her hands. She feels secure and safe on the ground but ready to take on the climb to new heights.<br /><br />The Nine of Swords is another favorite card. If only more of the cards shared this rich but muted palette I could more easily honor the Technicolor majority as having their appropriate place. In this card a woman with long red hair sits forward from the ruffled and appliqu&eacute;d pillows on her curtained four-poster, head in her hands as rich earth-toned tapestries tumble to the floor. Stone sculptures, a common motif, sit on the ground by the head of the bed. The somber colors help to affirm the standard meaning of this card: despair, interpreted in the book as \\"The things that go bump in the night.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately this deck is very traditional, hardly differing from the Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) images. Indeed they are so standard that small deviations tend to draw attention. For instance, both the Two of Wands and the Three of Wands feature ships, whereas only in the RWS Three of Wands do ships play a role. In the Tarot Illuminati, the ships are clearly leaving port in the Two of Wands and sailing back into the harbor in the Three. More ships return in the Three than left in the Two, which implies a successful venture, but the crashing of waves against rocks seems to recommend caution--the cargo is not safe ashore yet. The turbaned figure in harem pants and curl-toed slippers--the suit of Wands features stereotypically Persian dress--stands between two wands planted firmly in the ground, one before him and one behind him, while he holds the third tilted at an angle behind his back. This odd posture distorts the line of his body while at the same time flexing the muscles of his broad back, this sinewy strength clear under the skin-tight shimmering emerald green top he wears. He is perhaps using the wand to signal the ships, alerting them to the dangers of the coast.<br /><br />The distortion of form is a common theme in this deck. The nude man and woman in the Lovers card twist themselves in an interpretive dance that seems to bring the pain of the Fall to this Eden.<br /><br />The woman in the Star looks stiffly down at the water pouring out of her urns while she over arches her back, allowing her tiny naked breasts to point up to the gold filigree stars above. The glittering glow that swirls around the stars hovering in the pink and purple sunset sky and spirals around the streams of water breaking the golden reflection in the pool combined with the curling swoops of feathery blue and gold that grace both her body and the landscape bring a magical energy to the card, part photographic portrait and part aura painting.<br /><br />The dove in the Ace of Cups, rather than gracefully descending into the chalice, seems to struggle to escape, splashing five streams out of the cup as it rises amid sparkles, while many yods, the sparks of the Divine, cascade from its wings to shower the pink blossoms below. The hand from the fluffy white cloud holds the jeweled cup in twisted, claw-like fingers. The water lilies grow out of rock, another unnatural distortion. Overall the card seems to speak of the discomfort as we first twist out of the denial of the Divine and allow ourselves to open to receive the gift of heavenly abundance.<br /><br />There is a lack of cohesion to this deck that I find confusing. The Pentacles are all images of Asian people and culture. But this clear suit symbolism is not carried throughout the deck. The male characters in the Wands suit feature the Persian dress noted above (albeit in more lam&eacute; than one would expect from the implied time period), but the Wands women are in European costume. The suit of Cups features Western costumes from the Renaissance through the Elizabethan period, confusing the Swords which seem to be more strictly Elizabethan. Although I often appreciate decks that show a unique story or culture throughout a suit, in this case I would rather have all these time periods and cultures mixed together, creating a unified Tarot Illuminati universe that transcends time and culture--more Baz Lurhmann and less costume drama.<br /><br />The accompanying book is beautiful with full-color illustrations. It features several spreads and a brief section on how to read the cards. Each card has its own page, with a short monologue seeming to be spoken by the character featured on the card, followed by a paragraph of keywords. This unique take provides interesting reading. However, the back of the box promises that \\"every detail is meaningful\\" in this deck, and I would have been interested to hear this highly educated author's take on these details.<br /><br />There is a greatly expanded book, The Tarot Illuminati Revealed: A Complete Guide to the Tarot Illuminati, available in a Kindle edition from Amazon for an additional charge. A sample chapter of this longer tome is included in the volume in the boxed kit and showcases author Kim Huggens's extensive knowledge of mythology and history. It promises to be relevant to and revealing of tarot generally as well as the Tarot Illuminati specifically.<br /><br />The ornate detail of this deck is both help and hindrance. Each card is sumptuous, but with so much to notice, it is easy to get lost. Several people have mentioned to me that whereas they find each card lovely, there is a limit to how many cards can be laid out in a spread before chaos sets in. A spread with this deck is like a bouquet of every exotic flower in the shop without any carnations or baby's breath to provide the supporting cast that lets the star shine. It is clear from all the glowing reviews of this deck and all the raves I've heard from colleagues that many people have an eye for the splendor displayed here. But for those who don't, I wonder if it wouldn't be helpful to use this deck to highlight a three card overview and then incorporate a plainer, less colorful deck--perhaps a black and white deck--to fill in the details of the spread. This might be a great way to incorporate this deck in readings while not getting blinded by its dazzling beauty.

B00F35B8F8|4.0|Carries on the tradition... Love the coalition between the old and the new characters. Keep up the good work, looking forward to the next installment.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|This is the greatest vampire movie of all time. I read the book a long time ago and was pleasantly surprised that the movie got it right.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like it but you should be able to play longer. but I love how there's lots of animals and stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|having fun playing. great game. very creative. only reason fir 4 star is it glitches out froze up once already  on kindle fire and ipod.
B00132D808|5.0|Panic! at the Disco's 2nd album is good. Although it is different than their others, it shows a different side of there musical talent and abilites. It is melodic and rather soothing. Relaxing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has amazing graphics, an unbelievable atmosphere, fantastic sound effects and extremely enjoyable puzzles. The puzzles weren't too hard, nor were they too easy. I cannot WAIT for the next game in what I hope to be a lengthy series.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I was 1st introduced to Panic! at the Disco when their 3rd album, vices and Virtues came out. I liked that album so much that I thought I should check out their other albums. This album is good. Just once you start listening to over and over again, you really get to listen to the lyrics. Although I dont care for the words, I like the beat. Its worth a listen or buy.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I just adore this album. Was introduced to it via Pandora and I just love it. Go and get it now!
B002WPF4DY|5.0|Ever since I saw the original, I had to continue into the Final Destination Saga. Once you start watching, you will want to add this series to your collection.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Although I did not have very high expectations for this film, I still had thought it would be a fun movie to watch with my family.  I was wrong. And Jeff Bridges, what were you thinking?  How did this happen?  Very disappointing and terrible. Easily one of the worst movies I have seen in a long long time.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Awesome. You need to get this game.<br />I'm not a pool fan, but I am a fan of this.<br />Game on
B00F91SCXC|3.0|muddled movie- took awhile to get going. Zoombies and Contagion all rolled up in one movie. Not one I would have paid for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome and I love it. If you don't have this app you should get it. Updating it soon :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I could, I would put 10 stars on this. My I downloaded it for my 6 yr old great grandson, he is a whiz at the game and loves it. He has it at home, since  it first came out, but he sweet talked his way on getting it on my KindleFire HD, he has no problem with it whatsoever and plays on it daily. Loves building anything and everything. I highly recommend it (but not for me, lol).
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The main thing I liked about this book is how realistic it portrayed life. Nothing is sugarcoated, and yet relating to the characters in the book is so simple. It also gives a touching insight to the lives and struggles of others dealing with not-so-perfect health. Not my type of book, but still thoroughly enjoyed.
0425263908|5.0|Fantastic read  loved all 3 novels  was very surprised that there are two more books pending  Very disappointed that there is no release date yet
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Danny grown up? Amazing concept. The True Knot? Boring. Of course King is a great writer, but If you enjoyed being scared by the ghost story of the original, you'll be sorely disappointed by this non-ghost follow up.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|One of the better movies made from a comic book, that has a good plot. This movie is clearly better than a lot that were made.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the best game that I have. Dragon vale is super fun, not to mention that it's free.
B00915G6SU|5.0|My favorite show ever.  I am 65 years and have watched a lot of t.v. in my day.  Only have one complaint, I really miss Emily.  The group was perfect, a great meeting of minds.  Sure hope she will return again and stay on the show.  I just love, love Garcia and Spencer.  They bring a great perspective to the show.  Please bring Emily back.  Anyhoo,  Good job on the show.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Very good game. Gems are ruining it. Some tasks require you to only use gems and only a limited amount provided. Too easy to accidentally use your precious gems too. You should earn one for showing up everyday or be able to buy one for 1,000,000 each. I will soon be done with it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie has so many great heroes, such a positive movie to give to any child.  It doesn't disappoint, the story is captivating.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This is a stellar new album by DP. Don Airey is unbelievable on keyboards. Can anyone replace the late Jon Lord? NO. This album is dedicated to him as it should be. Steve Morse is just a sick guitarist and his solos are awesome. Whoever said that Ian Gillen's voice is gone is a moron. He cannot sing  \\"Child In Time\\" like he once could but give this top ten rock singer his due. The man, like DP, is a legend and icon. Add to this Roger Glover's rock solid bass line and Ian Paice thundering on the skins and you have an all time classic band.<br />The album is different for DP but make no mistake, it rocks. At times they sound like Kansas, Yes, and themselves.<br />Bob Ezrin put it down on tape like few others do. If you like Classic Rock and DP, this is as good as I have heard in a very, very long time.<br />Deuce
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted for a calculator.  A simple user friendly no frills app.  If that's what you're looking for then this is the perfect one for you..
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|OK game but it needs more sounds from a real air hockey table. The lights and game play are a plus, I however found it easy to beat.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi is an unbelievable story about a sixteen-year-old Indian boy who survives on a lifeboat for over two hundred days with a Bengal tiger. I have mixed feelings on this book. There are several reviews that say the book is a slow read and really boring, while others proclaim it is the best book they ever read. My thoughts are somewhere in between because while there are a lot of long descriptions of his life on the boat that are tedious to read, many of the concepts of life that Pi discusses are fascinating. His thoughts on religion and humanity are what make the book worthwhile to read, in my opinion. For example, one of the many topics he discusses is about how fear is “life’s only true opponent” and goes onto explain that if you just avoid the fear instead of facing it, “you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you”.  It’s these types of thoughts in the novel that make you think about your own life. The end of the book leaves the reader questioning what actually happened on the lifeboat and what were hallucinations. However, the reader is left with a bigger question: is it worthwhile to believe in something that seems impossible rather than believing in fact? Pi argues, “ ‘Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?’”<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys very descriptive writing or survival novels. Although I enjoyed the overarching concepts and themes, I found myself getting quite tired and bored while reading throughout most of the book. So, I would probably recommend this to adults, not teenagers. However, overall, it was pretty inspirational and worth a read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh how i love to play this game its &aacute; lot of pure fun,one way i like to calm down after a day of work!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! definitely will. keep you entertained! wish you could earn more points easier though! but overall, awesome game!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game. easy to learn multiple levels keep it interesting.  I cant stop playing it. recommended for anyone who wants to kill some time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|None of my devices fits to it, I cant use it and sold it again. The Chromecast has to work with all Androidphones
B001HM1PFO|5.0|About the only musical I can watch! Love Tim Curry as Dr. FrankNFurter. And of course who doesn't love to time warp haha, such a great movie
B002ONC9NM|4.0|This is a very good movie with a story line that is more realistic than most.  It is not trumped up theatrics.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a beautiful clock with tons of  whistles and  bells. I will have to spend more time with it to learn what all it does.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Great product and worth the postage costs to the UK, very happy with it complements the steelbook that I got as well..
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is amazing for people who really like picture books. I would recommend it to you. It is worth the money
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Well written, funny, informative.  I love how she uses quantum physics (in &#34;human&#34; terms) to clarify.  You may have read other attraction/manifestation type books before, and still read this one.  I think it does the best job of explaining why that may not have &#34;worked&#34; for you in the past.  The exercises are so easy, your kids can do them with you...and it would be a wonderful gift for them if you asked them to!<br /><br />My &#34;gift&#34; from the first exercise blew me away...do yourself a favor, and get the book :)
B008J34466|5.0|Another excellent release from P!nk!! She's never afraid to say exactly what's on her mind!! I love, love, LOVE it!! :-)
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This book is excellent for how to increase your wealth in the long run. What stuck out more for me wasn't the strategy on how to become wealthier, but it was the tough love mentality. This is a must read for anyone who is trying to not only be wealthier, but also be more successful. Really helps create a positive mindset.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I just wish it came with instructions, I had no idea how to play the game...thank goodness my daughter showed me how to play some of the games and too pay for extra things....doesnt seem fair
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game with non stop action. Good for everyone any time anywhere. The kids will enjoy it as much as the adults.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Booty Quest.<br />Well when you reach a certain amount of points and you buy either booty time, blue blaze or perfect storm it only last for one game and then you have to start all over again...I dont like that.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Robert Glasper continues to deliver us top-shelf artistry with every composition! Gift this to yourself and someone else, give the gift of music. Music is life!
0061655554|4.0|Although over 20 years old, the story has not dated and is both outrageous (as one author says, &#34;You couldn't make this stuff up&#34;) and entertaining. Business and human nature don't change!!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Terrible, just terrible.  I usally like both actors. But this thing they did is just terrible no remeemimg qualities. Ughh
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting!  You will become hooked on this game quickly.  Fun, fun, fun !  Glad it's on the kindle fire now....  Maybe not lol.
B00BEIYMIS|3.0|I'm sorry this movie was not scary to me,but it is probably because I have had more moments with ghosts walking through me or pushing each of my family down the stairs in our own house than I care to count,I have gotten used to them and so have the rest of my family. The ghosts were in our house before us so they just wanted some respect and we have come to an agreement and we now live in peace,we are lucky its all they wanted.<br />If you want something with more scare then rent Haunting in Conn. instead, plus it has a moral in the story if you open your mind to it.Thank you and have a great day.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|in ufc, people get hurt, but robots fight to the breakdown? amazing skill needed to make such a game. I approve.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love MC, but its unfair that Minecraft PC get to  have. skins and PE doesnt.  We paid for it so we need skins.
0451232577|5.0|Typical Ken Follett has action, adventure a great story lines and you get to learn a lot of history all at the same time.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I took only my Kindle on a business trip and I was able to access FB without any problem.  Worked well.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really liked this last book. Lots of twists and turns and action as you'd come to expect after reading the first two. There was also a really nice progression for the characters that felt true to who they were based on the previous books. The end is definitely devastating and I can understand how lots of fans feel betrayed by Roth after putting in the time to fall in love with these characters, but I felt that It was a realistic and fitting end to the series. We've come to expect these types of series to end tied up with a happy ending bow, and while this one doesn't quite end that way, it still feels hopeful and true to the Divergent world that was created for us.
B004S5BPAC|5.0|This was second viewing of the movie, and the intensity of film is still there for me. At the expense of using a movie review cliche, it is an extremely gritty and intense movie that portrays the pain and desire of a family, it's members, and associates as they chase their current dream and come to grips with dreams of the past that were never realized. The performances by all the actors are outstanding, and the chemistry among them drives the movie. If you haven't seen it, do so.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Super fun movie! Very funny and great for the whole family. I'm so glad we bought it! Whoa that snail is fast!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was one of the better book of Stephan Kings and nice to revisit The Shining.<br />It's a good read and worth the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This a real fun game that makes you think. Collect usable items and figure out what and where they are needed. Had fun, needs more levels
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book. I laughed. I cried. Just read it!! Can't wait for the movie!! :) John Green is an amazingly talented author!!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|The author was able to keep the mystery alive through the book with the many twist and turns of each character.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is such an amazing show!! I've been hooked since the very beginning! I missed the season finale and when the new season started I had to recap. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a drama related show!
B0076UXKDG|5.0|This is a great addition to the D800 camera - it fits and feels like it should to perfectly match the finish on the camera, the added shutter release button and contoured grip bottom make it very easy to switch from horizontal to landscape orientation without arm contortions, and it just adds that little bit of additional 'substance' to the camera body that I really like.  I had thought about 3rd party grips because they are so much less expensive, and saw some that my friends had and wasn't impressed, so I bit the Nikon bullet and bought this overpriced unit, and except for the outlandishly high price, I'm very happy with the unit.  It's on my camera all the time, never comes off - except to access the in-camera battery.  Bye the way, I had one of those camera skin things on my camera before I got the grip, and the grip didn't snug up to the camera tight enough with the skin on, so if you have a skin, it won't work with the grip.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Its a Marvel origins movie.  In my mind, its one of the best that had been done up until Avengers.  The thing I love is the passion that the main character has.  This is what the heart of the Avengers is meant to be.  I had low expectations for this movie and the movie made me love Cap again.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the concept, as well as the actors.  They did a great job with the theatrical twist and special effects.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's alright but makes me start over after installing update. That is frustrating and a waste of time. The frequent encouragement to make purchases is also irritating.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Over done special effects.  Poorly done plot & characters. A poorly done cartoon and mimic of Ghost Busters without the fun.
B006R6ZP6U|4.0|Great Halloween movie. Somewhat good family film except for very small kids. Our maybe you family dog. Ha ha ha
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It was a great read , wasn't really what I expected , but really enjoyed it . Would read this author again .
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat and craving more. I didn't want to put the book down in anticipation for the sequence of action we all know so well from Roth. I feel it came rather late in the novel, and it left a bitter taste in my mouth, for it did not feed the fire inside me that was dying for the happily ever after. I was not pleased with certain decisions Roth made in ending this novel, but it did wrap up the theme to this series quite nicely. A part of me wishes I could go back and rewrite the resolution, but half of me knows the meaning of Allegiant wouldn't have been satisfied leaving it with a Cinderella happily ever after. Kudos to Roth for ripping my hearts to shreds, but making the inevitable not so hard to handle.
B001NLYXOE|3.0|The movie does an incredible job of capturing the violent and self-centered natures of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. However, Macbeth does not seem to be very manly or able to unseam a man from nave to chops. I wish that just once heroes were cast as they would appear in reality. Are there any manly Shakespearean actors?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cool and the most expensive and the most popular has been a utility that the most popular. Wait I LOVED IT so much I think that your money should be spent on it.<br />-THEONCELER
0316247545|4.0|I like the cover design and the print quality, the fact it looks like the story book from the show is a nice touch. The chapters talking about the settings and characters are nice as well and even have come nice examples of Lauren Faust's concept art included, some of them even complete with productions notes scribbled in the page, which is always fun to see. The little bits of commentary were nice as well, as well as the forwards from Megan, Larson, and Lauren.<br /><br />However, I do agree with the sentiment some people have voiced about the way 2/3 of the book are just episode descriptions and song lyrics with very little commentary or extra information, a little behind the scenes stuff in the episode guide would have made it perfect.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|From beginning to end I was in love with this book. It sent me through a rollercoaster of emotions but I felt as though it was the right ending for this series. I think death isn't something we all find easy and Tris' story...for it to end the way it did brought things to a close. It came full circle and brought a reality to life that we all face, even if we aren't happy with the result. The end even though people are upset, it was real and honest and beautiful especially in the epilogue. Nothing ever ends in the best possible outcome and she did something no one expected.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|made an ok day a fun day!! I laughed a majority of the movie and had others wondering what I was laughing at the entire time!
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|This movie is perfect!!! Huge Beyonce fan so of course I loved it, I think it will show others more about Beyonce when she is not in the public eye.  I'd recommend this to anyone!
B005IQZB14|5.0|As a guy I didn't think I would enjoy this book but I was absolutely wrong!!!!!  I LOVED this book and Cheryl!  She was so honest and open, it feels like I actually know her!  Best book in a long time!  Congrats Cheryl Stayed!!!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I use this app on my phone and Kindle Fire and I love it!! As a fluent French speaker with no one to keep my language fresh with, I have tried many language apps to stay sharp. This one is by far my favorite.  The UI is great and I love the daily reminders to practice.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Just started watching but so far promises to be good. One of my favorite series and I'm not even into zombies.Great story line but not for people who can't overlook some gore.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Show keeps you on your toes. Each season brings new and interesting problems for the characters to deal with. Love it.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|A movie the whole family can enjoy! The kids just want to keep watching it over and over again. Thanks!
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Some lyrics are stupid but honestly it is very catchy and I cant stop listening to it. Some good songs too
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! I can't stop playing. Warning once you start you wont want to stop!! I am so happy this finally came out for my kindle.
B00CIR97UW|5.0|This book will please those who enjoy both math and good sitcoms. The book is well written with numerous references to several shows from the last 20 years. It is really remarkable the amount of math talent in the Simpsons' creative team. The book is not really a deep treatise on mathematics but has excellent pointers and references that can guide the reader to study some of them in further reading. Take it as a good and light scientific reading for a weekend and you'll have a good time.<br />If you get the book's jokes you are entitled to some kind of Ph.D. on math humor so don't skip the tests ... I didn't get the PhD but at least a got good scores up to the MsC on math humor.
B00DW3GJK2|5.0|One of the great historical films.  They put in the extra effort on this one and planes they made for the film still fly today.  The most imaginative use of modified aircraft to recreate the Japanese air force.  Not quite as imaginative regarding the US Air Corps and Naval Aircraft, it nonetheless if the best films on Pearl Harbor to date.. Makes that Ben Affleck Pearl Harbor film look like the trash it was.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast works the way it is intended to. However, after a using the Chromecast for over two month it still does not have a lot of apps that one can use. I have only seen Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora. If you download the Apple app for Chromecast the only two channels that can be used are Netflix and YouTube. With all this said, the Chromecast is a great product for the money. The cliche quote definitely applies here, &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. I have faith that Google will provide more content in the future. If anything changes, I will add to my review.<br />The dongle itself must be connected to a power supply either on your t.v. set or to the wall. This extends the size of the dongle. In addition, if the dongle does not fit into your T.V.'s HDMI port you will have to connect the extender, provided in the box.
B000V39KDO|4.0|One of the best &#34;graphic novel&#34; type films.  It's been panned, but this film recreates the &#34;legend&#34;, not the fact,and that is it's intent so being over the top is irrelevant.. And a little real history slips in from time to time. Thoroughly enjoyable and Gerard Butler gets the line that will be one of the top great remembered lines in cinematic history.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy this is on kindle now. I now know why all my friends are addicted. I just wish it gave you more lives cause some of the levels are a booger
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved this book I could barely put it down I recommend it to all that liked the first book
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked since I started, it feels like a combination of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, if you like the genre this book should be in your list
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Pretty good took a while for the action but all in all is was interesting. Id buy the dvd or bluray.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I think this is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen in a long time. There are a lot of different influences in this film, but I think they did a good job incorporating those influences for a compelling story with fabulous shoots of scenes and locations.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You'll have a blast playing this game i know do At first it can be slow but like all games it gets better
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|It does in fact get better every time I see the movie or read the book. It always reminds me that I don't want to be a sheep
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I brought this item for a friend. We both love watching this show and it was decently priced however I find it ridiculous that there is only 2 episodes per disc. If we were to devote a whole day to watching the whole season it would be filled with constantly changing the disc. Other then that I was pleased with the item and shipping.
B009NH6JRE|4.0|Quality increase from previus seasons but this is not the best one. Hope next season show up better. Youll enjoy it
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Its got cool settings, easy to use, and you can customize. I like it and the photos. Its really a great app
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book rates up there with A Time to Kill, as it kept me rapt from start to finish.  I read this in one sitting (in-between checking emails and eating)!  You do not need to have read A Time to Kill in order to understand what is happening in this story.  The personalities of the characters and storyline are what keeps me coming back to John Grisham, and this novel delivers.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Perfect for doing daily report calculations with my business.  I can see it well and not have to flip my screen on my computer to to do the calculations....handy!
B0054LJGWS|1.0|If I could give this book negative stars I would. What a waiste of my time trying so hard to get through it that by page 40 I had enough. People were right, the book is a hot mess and does not keep your attention.I was so bored I finally gave up at page 40. Don't bother to waiste your money or time. Or do! Lol and see for yourself. I'm honestly not even surr how the book got any good ratings at all? Unless those folks were high as a kite. Or got paid to give good ratings.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Read first two in three days. Can't wait o read last one. Could not put down. Worth the money.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing novel! !!!!! The book had so many twist and turns. We read this at book club and it was a great book to discuss. Have fun reading it, i would be interested to know who's side your on :-)
0804164223|5.0|it is dark and unexpected and the narrators are terrific. I loved Gone Girl and was expecting to be disappointed but I am overwhelming going to recommend this book to friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I can play on the big screen! I've been waiting a long time for this game to come to the kindle.
B008220D5K|4.0|Some of the harsh reviews that are posted regarding this movie make me wonder if there's another movie out there with the same title. We couldn't possibly be posting about the same movie. The plot, the characters and especially the dialogue all rang true with me. Free from all cliches for this type of movie and wonderful supporting work from Albert Brooks, John Lithgow, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O' Dowd, Jason Siegal and Megan Fox. As an Apatow fan since Freaks & Geeks and Undeclared, there was no disappointment on my part regarding this very funny, character driven film. This is certainly not a 1 or 2 star film and I'm wavering between rating it a 4 or 5 star movie.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|An excellent finale to the Covenant series.  JLA had me guessing about the way things would end right up to the final five pages.  This whole series has been a good blend of quirky, funny, gut-wrenching and oooh myyyyyy.  While I loved every book in this series, Sentinal was one that really resonated in me - I could relate to Alex much better, not to mention certain maniacal characters that featured.  The whole series was brilliantly and realistically (for me, anyway) paced.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Kudos to JLA for the great work on top of everything else she's been working on at the same time.  It can't be easy to be writing multiple series concurrently, so hats off to you!
B00FN811SY|5.0|As a Bible student, this is an excellent research tool. Not only does it contain the NWT, but 4 additional translations for comparison. It also contains additional reference material, such as a comprehensive appendix section of valuable Bible information. It's easy to navigate, and the format is logically arranged. In over 40 years of Bible research, I have never found a better tool for understanding God's word.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|bought full game but will not let me play past 2nd part. Keeps going back to apps instead of loading and going forward. Will not bother to purchase from fireproof games again.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this game because it was vampires, I am not disappointed, it is a fun and addicting game that is challenging at times.  Well done!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Expected so much, especially since now in screenplay. How could you right a third book that was so monotonous and then ends like that.  Guess there won't be three movies
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson creates an amazingly rich, amazingly foreign world. It took me a while to get into the world and the story, but once hooked, I couldn't set it down. Fantastic read and I can  wait to get into the next  one.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am enjoying the ease with which I am learning the languages and I like the fact that I can strengthen words. All in all this is a great app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicting I could not put it down. you get to the point where you have one life left and you go into survival mode
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it!!!! So much fun, running, jumping and going into the mines. I can't get far yet but love trying.<br />My eight year old of course rocks at it in no time beats my score. I love when the character comes back unexpectedly I end getting spooked and my character dies.
1742204147|4.0|At close to 900 pages, this book, covering all of Japan, provides a complete overview for Westerners who are approaching the country for the first time. If you don't know the difference between Hamachi and Uni, and are uncertain where to put the dot for Tokyo in an illustration of Japan, this book is for you. The first 100 or so pages present a nice full color review of Japan and Tokyo in particular. After that, we go to a series of pages illustrated largely by monochrome maps, listing all the various city/region destinations within Japan. These pages have some descriptive elements directing the visitor to the major sites in each area, with some additional notes provided for restaurants, clubs, and hotels. Too heavy to really carry along, I'd probably use this initially to plan my trip, then find some more detailed resource for the specifics that I'd bring along with a few photocopies of specific pages from this text.
0307155102|4.0|I have a 15 month old.  We leave this book out in our living room.  Though it isn't his favorite book right now, we do enjoy flipping to a random page to point at and learn the different words.  Some of the pages don't \\"work\\" for him yet, but there are quite a few that will hold his attention for long periods of time.  (Like the farm, zoo, fire truck page - because he likes to make the animal noises or sing the \\"fire truck\\" song)  In the end, I strongly think this book will get a lot of mileage at our house.
B00ER23V1W|4.0|For a movie relatively bereft of sound effects and light on dialogue due to its setting, Gravity sure was heavily scored. The soundtrack runs 72 minutes (out of a movie slightly over 90 minutes long). As befits the movie, the soundtrack is presented simply with no gimmicks: sixteen long tracks that chronologically depict the emotional content of the movie.<br /><br />The pulsating, layered electronic sounds and dissonant strings that characterize most of this album are not entertaining in the conventional sense-even for a film music buff-but they are effective in building tension. Ferocious action cues intermingle with extended  background music. However, the climax is appropriately thrilling and becomes more melodic, and a nonverbal vocal element is introduced to highlight the increasing humanity of the situation.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important criteria for evaluating any soundtrack is that it fits the movie, and this one definitely does. Minimalist, gut-wrenching, and uplifting.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|The acting is superb and the storyline keeps getting better each season. It's nice when the cast stays together, great ensemble.
B009AMANH4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. It was my choice for Best Movie over Argo (which was not bad).
B004SIP9VA|5.0|Joyful movie. In this era of DWTS, a brief appearance of Tony Devaloni (sp). Richard Gere out does himself, totally charming and romantic, along with Susan Suranden,Jennifer Lopez and let me not leave out Stanley Tucci (who knew)!. This film with bring a smile to your face and a tug of your heart strings.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Very inspirational, real life teaching, teaches you about failures of life but it lets you know how to get back on track
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|PERFECTION - THESE SONGS ARE SO ADDICTIVE.  I HAVE THEM ON REPEAT EVERYDAY SINCE I BOUGHT IT.  HER VOICE IS PERFECT.  I LOVE HER STORY AND LOVELY SMILE TOO.
B002UZCJP2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bruce Willis, and while this movie is somewhat limited in scope, it has a most satisfying ending for a movie [spolier alert]: people deprived of their robotic surrogates and forced to face the world in their own flesh and blood. The lesson here is that life cannot be lived in the virtual world; that's not living at all.This movie is reminiscent of those who live attached to their smart phones: put them down and talk to the people around you!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Not a bad game. Takes forever to have crops finish since its in real time. It's fun when you can actually do something. Maybe once I get further in the fan me it will be better. Add me if you like FAUDVYH.
B004RL9T50|4.0|This is one of the funnier movies I've seen, whether as a cartoon or not. Will Ferrell is excellent as the voice of Megaman, Plus, if it's of interest to you, it's clean! You'll probably watch this movie several times a year, and find it just as funny each time you watch it.
0142410349|5.0|Another classic from Rohl dahl. A great read for encourage a love of books in my 7 year old. Easy to get into and invested in the characters and no one writes the bad guys quite like Mr Dahl. I highly recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A very interesting sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; with a new twist that keeps one riveted! Stephen King does it again!
1476727651|5.0|Even though Danny and his mother escaped the Overlook Hotel, the shining has not left Danny. His unique gift became even more of a curse as he entered into adulthood. He spent a good portion of his twenties and early thirties drunk and hungover. After he wakes up in a strange bed with a girl he hardly knows draped across him, Danny flees. He leaves behind the girl and her eighteen month old son, even though the shining tells him the boy is being beaten by his uncle. He makes his way to New Hampshire where a kindly stranger with his own spark of shining offers him a job. Slowly, Danny finds some friends and gets sober. Meanwhile miles away, a young girl is born with the shining. Over the years, she communicates with Danny via his blackboard. Then one day, she sends a desperate message, she is in trouble. A band of psychic vampires the True Knots led by the despicable Rose the Hat are after her. They will stop at nothing to capture Abra. Can Danny save Abra from the True Knots?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*I am proud to consider myself one of Stephen King's constant readers. I have been reading his books for over twenty years now. Many I loved, a few were not so hot. Every once in awhile, he delivers a book so powerful that I am in awe. I am pleased to report that Doctor Sleep is just one of those reads. It is King at his finest. I had a serious case of book hangover after finishing this one! It has everything you love in a solid King book: flawed but likable characters, horrible villains, intense suspense and plenty of paranormal. If you are a fan of King, I think you will love this book. I can't wait to read it again.<br />*One thing that I always appreciate in a good Stephen King book is his characters. Mr. King's characters are meticulously created, he takes his time introducing them to the reader with all their flaws and secrets. His characters are always a bit troubled and some even tortured by their pasts, but I am always drawn to them, and I find myself liking them despite their flaws. Danny Torrance all grown up is a miserable alcoholic a bit like his father. He is an absolute mess, and it was hard to see the boy that I loved and cheered for in The Shining faltering. Whenever I read a Stephen King story, I always feel like he pours a piece of his soul into each and every one of his characters because so many of their experiences are described with such detail that I feel like only someone who lived it could write it. The alcoholism that plagues Danny, his fall to rock bottom and subsequent recovery are painstakingly detailed. I just knew that Danny's story was in part Mr. King's story. It was apparent Danny's alcoholism recovery was based on personal experiences, and for those of you who don't know, Stephen King early in his career did indeed suffer from severe alcohol and drug abuse until his wife and children helped him get sober. I very much enjoyed catching up with Danny and watching him overcome the ghosts of his past and present as he strives to become a better man.<br />*The pace of this book is slow and steady. If you haven't experienced a King masterpiece, you may be unfamiliar with his careful and painstaking pace as he takes his time to introduce you to the characters and build the conflicts. Everything is laid out clearly and concisely and there is no doubt as to where the story is headed, but even though you know what is coming, Mr. King manages to throw in some jaw dropping surprises that left me completely stunned. I loved it! Reading a King book is like going on a long journey, you have to take your time and be patient and just let the magic of the story soak in. The pay out in the end is almost always worth the trip.<br />*I love the range of emotions that I feel when reading a King book. He makes me laugh at his unique sayings, and in fact, over the years many of his one liners have worked into my vocabulary. I always appreciate his candor and humor. One minute I am smiling and enjoying the story, and the next, I am on edge waiting tensely as the horror mounts. King knows how to frighten without resorting to a lot of blood, guts and gore. He knows how to slink into your mind and stir into the dark corners where you have hidden away the childhood bogey man. He gets you when you are least expecting it. I cannot tell you how much admire his ability to make me feel as I read. I laughed, I cried and I shuddered in fear. Loved it!<br />*The villains, the True Knot, are absolutely vile. I quaked with dread every time the story switched to the view point of Rose the Hat. She is the ultimate bad guy, and she truly frightened me. Absolutely without a doubt, one of King's best and creepiest villains to date. I felt my stomach knot with fear each time the story was through her eyes. She is nasty, and I hated her.<br />*I had the pleasure of listening to the audiobook version of Dr. Sleep, and I cannot recommend it enough. Will Patton does an absolutely amazing job narrating this one. His character voices, especially Rose the Hat and her main man, The Crow, are phenomenal. I couldn't get enough of his narration. His female voices are well done and I had no problems with them. This was perfect to listen to during those last sunny days of autumn as I spent the afternoon in the sunshine with my kids. I didn't dare listen to this before bed as I didn't want any nightmares. Once I hit the midway point, I was glued to it. I couldn't put it down. One day, I started listening to it on my way to the store, and what was supposed to be only and hour or two listen, ended up stretching into six hours as I had to finish it. It was one heck of a journey. If you can get a hold of the audiobook, I suggest you do so. I loved it! Will Patton rocks, and I will certainly be listening to other books that he narrates.<br />And The Not So Much:<br />*I in no way feel qualified to criticize anything of Stephen King's because he is without a doubt a master story teller, and the author I have read and loved the most. I do have a couple of tiny things that I thought could have made the story a bit better. The ending was a bit strange. The storyline with the True Knot and Danny and Abra settles out satisfactorily, but then there is a bit of a lengthy epilogue which was fine, but I was left wanting to know more about Abra and how she was adjusting. The final scene was strange as I don't think it really tied into the story. It is hard to explain, but I think it ended in a weird place.<br />*Early on, you are introduced to Rattlesnake Andie. She becomes the newest inductee into the True Knot bandits. There are several scenes from her view point, and I was led to believe that she would play an important part in the story, but alas her involvement in the story is minimal, and she ends up having very little to do with the story. Not a big deal, but I was expecting more from her.<br />*I found Abra's great grandmother, Conchetta, fascinating and in fact, aside from Dan and Abra, she was my favorite character. Her story line drifts out and ends suddenly, and I was left wanting more.<br />My heart leapt with joy at the beginning of the book when Dick Hollaran returns. I loved his character in The Shining, and I was so happy to have him in this story, but sadly his part is very small and I was sad that there was not more of him. I also wished that Dan's mother was a bit more involved, I would like to have known a bit more about what happened to her after the hotel and such before her illness.<br />*I was left a bit confused over the True Knots. How did they come to be? Were they created by the Grandpa, and if so where did he come from? What were they chanting? What were their beginnings?<br />*Finally, I was a bit surprised, and relieved to be honest, that the big climatic showdown settled out as easily as it did. Not that I wan't thrilled the way it worked out, but in all honesty, I was expecting it to be more of a kick in the gut and horrific, but thankfully it was not.I really shouldn't complain, but being a seasoned King reader I was prepared for the worst, and it doesn't happen.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Doctor Sleep is the best book I have read in 2013. It was King at his finest, and I rate it right up there with my two favorite King books: Wizards and Glass and It. This was an epic read that gave me a serious case of book hangover after I finished it. It was hard to pick up another book when my mind was still entrenched in this story. I cannot recommend this book enough! It was amazing. I cannot wait to go back and reread it and experience the tremendous story all over again. If you are an old King fan, or a relatively new one, or even someone who hasn't experienced the awesomeness of a King book, you should read this book! I loved it!<br /><br />I purchased an audiobook copy. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review.<br />Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings.d loved the most.

0380729407|5.0|Another wonderful Bradbury.! This is the second Bradbury that I read in just a few months. The first was a collection of short stories, this is a novel.<br />It is part a boy growing up tale, part chilling tale, part good vs. evil take, part philosophical notes of life.<br />It is wicked by not in a \\"Carrie\\" or \\"Scissorhands\\" way. It is more haunting and witchy than true horror.<br />If you read this just for the prose - the metaphors and descriptions - you won't be disappointed. Nearly every paragraph is rich in description. The boys run and when they run together nearly every word creates the sensation of movement. When they finally stop, the tale switches to thoughtful comment. This is truly another tale from the master of prose.<br />The boys go to a carnival and that is when all the fun and challenges start. There is an carousel that runs forwards and backwards and changes people. There is a truly evil Dark Man and an evil Witch who would love to suck the good from you. I won't spoil the rest. Just to say that nothing is as it appears as the boys will discover. They are challenged and well as the father of one of the boys.<br />I thought about 3/4ths of the way that the prose got a little too hidden, a little too much and was sometimes difficult to read.<br />Otherwise I was hanging on to every word.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Love having the Cloud version available on my Roku. The music is good. Reminds us of The Beatles when they were in their first time of recording on their own. Paul Mc. still has talent as a writer and a performer.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Not near as scary as I thought it'd be..a little disappointed. But I'll give it  points for no nudity or bad language.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am okay with the decisions the author made in the end book of this series...but I felt this book left me asking why?.. what happened after?.. was it worth the sacrifice?  I left out two stars because I felt this book was incomplete and I waited almost a year for the ending of this series, but I  wish I could half a star.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|This game does not do anything.  I am not sure what I expected but this so called game, after a neat opening display, doesn't really do anything.
B00BVYJG18|4.0|I saw KSE in one of their first shows with LOG and was not impressed so I didn't buy the album.  Recently it was available for $3.99 so I said what the heck.  I was really pleased and surprised that the album was so much better than that first performance and it has found it's way into my rotation.  A very solid album!
B000002KDO|5.0|Another example of great Rock  & Roll or great heavy metal. Whatever you want to call. Not just a bunch of loud noise. Great compositions!
0763644765|5.0|I gave this book to my granddaughter for her 2 year old. The little girl loved the book and wanted it read over and over. She then decided it was time to try out what she was learning. She has been quite successful in her potty learning. I really recommend this book for all moms. This takes any difficulty out of training.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I love everything by Black Sabbath so naturally I love this album. What an incredible list of albums they produced. Excellent R&R!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The first book took you into the south and gave you a chance to meet the players in the story.  This new chapter in the lives of the characters takes you to a future time and place. Somewhat disappointed in the obvious explanation for the will.  I thought it could have been a little more complex but all in all a good read.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|I know I'm in a rut about Black Sabbath albums but I love them all. I do like their earlier works the most but this album represents them in a fine way.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Mazzy Star has been missing in action for a long time. With this album they return and Hope Sandoval's vocals never sounded better. The songs are all excellent with that dreamy, sensual sound and great instrumentation.They were a very influential band, you can hear their influence in the Civil Wars and the Head and the Heart and other contemporary bands.  I put the CD in my car player and listened to it for a week every time I drove anywhere, so glad they're back! Hope they follow up with a tour.
B000002KET|5.0|This, as with all Black Sabbath albums is just great, classic, powerful rock and roll. And it's not vulgar or demonic though a song or two might skirt the edge.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting is one of the most creative, and innovative  artists around today. Never content to rest on his considerable laurels he continues to explore and expand.In recent years he has explored music of the Middle  Ages and collaborated with a symphony orchestra. With The Last Ship tells a musical story of the city in which he was raised and how it's shipbuilding industry disappeared and how that affected the lives of the people who lived there at the time. It's an homage to his father and that generation. The songs are engaging and the music is definitely up to his high standard. I'm looking forward to when he takes this project on the road it really will come to life on stage!
B008YZ4RR0|2.0|Really lame dialogue. I don't actually know how this got four and five star ratings. The water was pretty though.
0884271153|4.0|This book builds upon the first book in the series (The Goal). It assumes that you are already doing the things recommended by the first book. It then shows you how you can use your improved capabilities in the market place.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|Great movie. I can watch over and over again. British humor. Never seems to get boring or old. I love it!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|What's the use of having an ad free version which really isn't so? Between the levels there are advertisements of other angry birds episodes and other products from rovio... why so??<br /><br />Other than that are the issues of delayed updates etc..
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not a bad game, but definitely need more &quot;help&quot; when you reach a level with a new type of obstacle explaining what it does.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|From time to time, a book touches my heart; this was such a book.  Evocative in its images of Mumbai,<br />and deeply meaningful in its portrayal of women,  family relationships,  and different cultures made this a really worthwhile and memorable book.<br />I HIGHLY recommend it,
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is definitely a challenge. I used to love chocolate before I started playing this game. However, maybe l will lose weight now because I hate chocolate!  Now if the could just invent one with Pepsi I could really get skinny.
B00C9QQBA6|5.0|In Aurora Conspiracy the Series: Crash Landing - Episode 1, by Ginger Gelsheimer and Christina Keats, an alien named Aurelius accidentally plummets to Earth in 1897. When Judge Proctor and his beautiful daughter Emily take Aurelius into their home and hearts, the alien finds himself working toward an objective outside his mission.<br /><br />The plot is well-developed and moves along at a brisk clip, galloping at least as quickly as Emily riding Sir Henry bareback. Under the looming shadow of the fate of the human race, Aurelius, Reli for short, discovers human feelings and Emily learns more about life outside her family and community. The nosy sheriff weaves in misgivings through the story.<br /><br />After you read this great story, be sure to check out Episode 2 of the series.
0399226907|5.0|I don't know any young child who doesn't love this book!  Our copy has been read over and over again.
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book in this trilogy was great.  I felt like the other two cheapened the whole experience.  You dont really expect or even want a happily ever after ending to such a hot steamy story... I should have stopped after the first book.  I was suckered into the other two.  I kept reading hoping that they would capture the same feel and excitement of the first.  Didnt happen :(
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very addictive, I enjoyed the games within the game, and many  helps<br /><br />available at  &quot;store&quot; to assist through the searches.
B000J10ER4|4.0|Really liked the movie when it first came out and purchased the dvd back when  first released and it some how got lost.  Very happy to find it on Amazon.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Entertaining for us but very predictable. Special effects were pretty good. Worth one watch for us but we wouldn't buy it.
B002ZG994U|4.0|I really liked this movie, was a big fan of the original T.V. show and thought the movie did it justice.  Love Liam Neeson  in action movies.
B00CCX9DUG|2.0|I am an absolutely avid reader of Philippa Gregory, but this book just did not do it for me. It seemed to drag a lot and while I was so interested in finding out more about Henry VIII's mother this did not inspire me. There was just too much on the sadness and constant misery within the whole machinations of the life these people led. I know that the history is important but I guess I want to hear those little human moments which make all the other heavy reading worthwhile.
006202406X|2.0|Why is it that Authors can write beautiful, meaningful, stories and then make them crash and burn at the end? Loved the first two , grossly disappointed with this one.
B00422LESO|2.0|It's impossible to rate this without bringing up the movie version, so I'm not going to pretend to ignore the movie.  I have never said that a movie version of a book is better than the book until now.  But the movie far surpassed the book in entertainment and fun.  I also feel that some of the things in the book (such as the clothes or Miss Charming's atrocious attempt at a British accent) just translate better in movie form.<br /><br />Movie aside, I found the writing to be lacking.  This book was clearly meant to be a vehicle for the story and not an exercise in eloquent prose.  Ms. Hale's dialogue writing is awful.  If you want a (very) quick, semi-entertaining beach read, the cheap kindle version might be worth it.  But otherwise, I'd say skip it and see the movie!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|sometines moving can be a little difficult in the game aside from that the game is worth it the bosses are difficult but not to difficult that's what I love about the game aside from almost everything requireing nemesis its a rely good game
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Very good story and active throughout. No downtime it starts out with action then gets even more wild as it goes. The visuals are great and the acting is well done. Love it! Way better than the book as far as a linear storyline. It takes the best parts of the book and makes a more easy to follow narrative. It's a movie you can watch over and over again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns of the many lives whose paths crossed to make us remember that what we do today is the foundation of our future
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Very scary and just the right atmosphere to get the creeps. Watch it in a dark room and I dare you not to be creeped.
B00122EX4Y|5.0|Every song is a winner. Mark and Emmylou's voices blend beautifully. I loved this album! I am delighted to be introduced to their music.
B009LDD54K|4.0|Well done and visuals are as usual beautiful. It's like a long movie and always enjoyable. Steve Busemi and all the cast and artists who bring back the proabition era have done a spectactular job in this series. It is as good as any movie made of that time period.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Listened to this album from start to finish. Then went back to track 1 and listened to the whole lot again. 'Nuff said.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game play.  The game is fun and challenging.  The different levels are unique.  The only flaws are it takes to long to regenerate a life.  I think 30 minutes is a long time to wait for a new life.  They could also up the number of lives from 5,it would be nice to not have to wait 2 1/2 hours to get life filled.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|Loved it. I try it everywhere I go...its so cool to see all the stars and their positions. Love it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book did not do justice to the storyline. I was constantly dissappointed while reading it. My recommendation: Stop after Insurgent, this book is not worth the time and effort.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game, great graphics and challenging levels. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is there are too many opportunities to spend way too much money on in app purchases.
B001LF347E|5.0|I have watched this show many.of times<br />For some reason I like it<br />I still have a couple of seasons to buy still<br />Great video, good picture and sound
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I am totally disappointed in this app.It did not work at all as an alarm clock or timer at all or ever. .It did work as an everyday clock and that is the reason it has one star.
B001O03NCW|4.0|Excellent way to relive the humorous glory of O Brother, Where Art Thou?.  Very complete collection from the motion picture.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series. One of the Better law series to come along since Boston Legal. A good ensemble cast, strong characters and excellent writing.
B002UJIY7A|3.0|The movie was great but it froze many times. I was really interested and it'd freeze up on me. I'd have to wait a few minutes before it'd start again.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|second time to watch it, enjoyed it very much.....waiting for the follow up;  and I don't usually ever get into alien stuff....
B00BRUPICM|4.0|This is the first Verhoeven book I've read. I found myself very interested in the characters. The main character has an engaging wit that's interesting! The story is not predictable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|You will love it. You unlock new things often. Survival and creative. Survival you have to survive zombies and skull archer me and bomb men and spiders. Creative you can make anything.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Another amazing masterpiece! Black Radio 2 is bigger and better than the first, never ceases to amaze me. A must have!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy the colors, the style, the hints. I really like how I can have the remaining  tiles shuffled so I can finish.
0316219266|5.0|Bloomberg Business reporter Brad Stone conducted over 300 interviews with current and former execs, employees, Bezos' friends and family, and even his long-lost biological father for this book. There is no more comprehensive account of Amazon anywhere.<br /><br />Founded in 1994, Amazon has been around longer than today's most relevant companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter), and much to my pleasant surprise, reading through each stage of its history is to simultaneously come to understand the growth and adoption of the consumer internet in general.<br /><br />The Everything Store chronicles these histories and the events that transpired, but the most important thing is that it does so exceedingly well by illuminating the contexts in which these events happened and the prevailing mindsets of the day. Everyone knows that Amazon changed the computing landscape with AWS, for instance, but understanding that its core idea was borne of videogame developer Steve Grand's book on &#34;primitives,&#34; and that it's now fashionable for venture capitalists to give their investees gift certificates to AWS, really drives home how quietly but insanely influential Bezos and Amazon truly are. This is not only great reporting, but great storytelling.<br /><br />Among the many founders and CEOs of game-changing companies of the last 100 years, Bezos is surely one of the few true polymaths, evidenced by his wide range of accomplishments—long tail ecommerce, side-by-side new/used shopping (Merchant Services), logistics (Mechanical Sensei), automation (Mechanical Turk), cloud computing (AWS), and e-reading (Kindle) to name only a few. Even with this all laid out, Stone leaves the reader with a stunning realization—we haven't yet seen all we will from him.<br /><br />That said, to miss this book is to miss the story of one of our time's greatest personalities as it continues to unfold.<br /><br />Random fascinating tidbits that are top-of-mind as I reflect on the book:<br />- Bezos was one of the original investors and advisors of Google, and with this &#34;he minted and entirely separate fortune that today might be worth well over a billion dollars.&#34;<br />- Amazon Prime was inspired in large part by Bezos friendship with Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco.<br />- Before he left Wall Street to start Amazon, two of Bezos' greatest inspirations were Dominos Pizza magnate Frank Meeks and computer scientist Alan Kays one of the original investors and advisors of Google, and with this &#34;he minted and entirely separate fortune that today might be worth well over a billion dollars.&#34;<br />- Amazon Prime was inspired in large part by Bezos friendship with Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco.<br />- Before he left Wall Street to start Amazon, two of Bezos' greatest inspirations were Dominos Pizza magnate Frank Meeks and computer scientist Alan Kay

B007A4SDCG|5.0|Perfect timing for me. I must be on target  Direct and to the point. Just the ammo i needed. For this i am greatful.
0307476073|1.0|I found the author to be self-centered, narcissistic, egotistical and frankly, not terribly bright. I was not inspired by this book at all. I finished it, but it was a downright chore to do so.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A tragically beautiful ending to the series! Action packed from page one, I wasn't able to put the book down.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've bought many, many headphones through the years including outrageously priced Bose (that broke after the one year warranty), and other noise canceling headphones.  NOTHING....I'll say it again....NOTHING is better than this pair of Sony.  My 21 year old son had researched these and they are outstanding!  Time will tell if they hold up to his part-time DJ job.  The sound quality is second to none and the price won't kill you like a pair of Dr. Beats, by the way I refused to pay $200 last year at Christmas for those cheap quality &#34;the in thing&#34; headphones.  I could tell that marketing scam a mile away last Christmas. This pair cost under $85 with tax included.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish I could give this book less than one star, but I won't because first of all, I physically can't, and second of all, I truly enjoyed the first two books, especially the first. I have to give her some credit for thinking up a creative story line with interesting characters, after all. However, my praise for her ends there because she butchered the story with the last book. This book had so much more potential.<br />Ok, so I'm just going to say right now that this post contains SPOILERS for the ending so don't read any further if you don't want to know how much the ending of this book sucked...<br /><br />So to keep this simple, I will list reasons for why this book just completely didn't work for me:<br /><br />1.) The trilogy started in Tris's voice. It was her story to tell, and she told it with her voice. Why, then, was she not given the right  to finish the story? Yes, she finished HER story, which is a completely different bullet point for this review, but this world that was created was told from her perspective, and she should have been the one to end it. Not Tobias. As much as I adored Tobias, it wasn't his story to finish. And I felt like the moral of the story that he learned at the end was so cliche and silly, and unrelated to the messed up point VR was trying to make by killing off the story-teller. &#34;Life sucks, so I just wait for the moments that don't.&#34; I mean seriously? Come on!<br /><br />2.) The author made a post on her blog about why she ended the book the way she did, kind of defending her reasons and trying to clear up misconceptions. Here's a hint: If you as the author have to publicly clear up misunderstandings so many of your readers have of what the point of your ending was in the novel, then you failed. You shouldn't have to explain to a huge amount of your readers that they are incorrect in the way that they think you meant the ending to be portrayed. You shouldn't have to defend it because SO many readers are stunned and angry. AS one of those readers, I can say I feel led on. I know it's a silly way to put it, and my husband can't stand to hear me rant about it any more which is why I'm trying to just get it out in this review. But Divergent had so much hope and relate-able elements to it that just drew me in, and I feel like I was built up only to be completely and utterly let down. I felt like this was a book of hope, and I didn't feel that way in the end. It felt like she was trying to tell a completely different story than the one I started with in Divergent, and that makes me feel a little lied to. Is that an extreme way to feel? Maybe. But that's how I feel and why I am writing this review.<br /><br />3.) Veronica said on her blog that she knew from the beginning that tris would die. She said that tris had continuously been struggling with the concept of selflessness, and that in Insurgent, she still wasn't ready to give up her life proclaiming &#34;Im not done yet!&#34; But that in allegiant, she was finally completely selfless because she asked her mom, &#34;Am I done yet?&#34; And of course, as cliche-ly as possible her mom replies something like, &#34;Yes my child, you've done so well.&#34; UGH. So is the point I'm getting from Veronica that Tris never truly learned to be completely selfless until she had been willing to give away her life? I don't like that message, if that's the case. It makes me sick, actually. Completely and totally sick. What bugged me about insurgent was how silly tris's choices were, as if she cared so little about her life, and cared even less about how it might affect others around her to carelessly offer it up. But when she realized that she didn't want to die, I had hope that she would see that SELFLESSNESS does not necessarily equate putting yourself in an inevitable situation of death! That is not something I can relate to. In divergent, I could relate to so much of what Tris was trying to learn: finding out who you are, deciding who you want tobe, being brave about it, facing your fears, being selfless. But I couldn't relate to this almost obsession she had with offering herself up as a sacrifice. I just couldn't. And what bugged me to no end was that she told her brother to tell Tobias &#34;I didn't want to leave you.&#34; The heck you didn't. She didn't even bring her gun with her to the end because SHE ADMITTED that she didn't think she would make it far enough to need it. Then what was the point of going in if she knew she probably wouldn't make it far enough to SUCCEED at the ultimate goal?! IT IS MADDENING! The circles that she writes around are just maddening.<br /><br />4.) The writing in this book just didn't live up to the writing in the first two (especially divergent.) The story telling was dull at most times, and just insanely frustrating at others. It felt rushed. And as so many have said, Tris's voice and Tobias's voice sounded too much alike for it to even be worth having his point of view added in. I personally feel that the only reason she switched the points of view was because she was gonna kill off the main voice..<br /><br />5.) I think that a book about a girl coming up in age and deciding the path she wants to take and the person she wants to be should end just as hopefully as it started.. FOR HER, not for her boyfriend because she freaking DIED!<br /><br />6.) I enjoy books with happy endings because I read those books to escape into a fantasy world that can teach, enthrall and lift me. I don't enjoy books whose endings are far more tragic and ridiculous than my own life. Maybe that's naiive of me. But that's my preference. And I'm pretty sure that is the preference of many and most young adult readers, which are the ones that she kind of marketed this book towards.. so yet another reason I feel lied to.<br /><br />Any ways, I could go on but I won't. My main reasons for disliking this book are out on the table, so hopefully I can move on from it. If you have read the first book,just stop there. I think it could have even ended there quite satisfyingly.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The third (and final) Veronica Mars series ends as though it didn't realize it was canceled.  Luckily they Kickstarted a movie that will be coming out soon, so now's your time to catch up on the fantastic TV series.  I enjoyed Season 3 and felt it was up to snuff with the rest of the series, though I know some people didn't like the shift to college and additional characters, though many of them will return in the movie...aka Pez ;-)

B00A0MJ9VY|4.0|Classic Disney movie on Blu-Ray, though not without a few reservations. There are screenshot threads comparing the blu-ray with the VHS and I feel that this bluray is a worthy upgrade without too many awful mistakes like on the Cindarella blu-ray or others like Little Mermaid (has been recalled), Robin Hood, and Sword in the Stone.  Luckily it wasn't edited or changed to make it any less-racist, so it's still the Peter Pan you remember :-)  But the transfer is a huge step up from the awful DVD that was released a few years back.
B000063UR1|5.0|great flick great price ive been lookn for this one for a while found a great copy easily on this site
B00AO686MY|5.0|Fantastic marrying of cartoon characters and the real world.  I have not seen this movie since it came out on DVD, but the Blu-Ray is even more impressive.  The film looks as fantastic as the day it was released and the melding of cartoons with actors is still seamless and perfectly executed.  There are hilarious extras showing scenes filmed using stand-in puppets instead, which are a must-watch.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|It's the Arcade Fire discovers the early 80s and disco record. I love that I can hear influence from people like Georgio Moroder - but it's funny to hear people call it groundbreaking. Nice record, though the slower tracks meander a bit.
B008AT71WI|5.0|FINALLY!  The original DVD of Little Shop of Horrors featured a black and white deleted ending, but was quickly pulled from shelves and re-released later without the scenes.  This blu-ray features the uncut, original Director's Cut of the movie with the alternate ending edited back into the movie as Frank Oz originally shot it.  This version is better, in my opinion, and it is wonderful to see it in HD, looking as fantastic as the rest of this HD transfer.  The puppetry and special effects in this film look as real and wonderful as when the movie came out, and are WAY better looking than anything even modern-day CGI could manage.  This set has a blu-ray book with photos and stuff and fits nicely with other blu-ray book editions.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does what I wanted it to do and does it well.  Like everything, it could use improvement, but they have the basics down pat and thats what matters.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|If you have not seen this movie, watch this blu-ray of it on the largest screen possible. We watched it projected on 108&#34; screen and it was stunning.  You could see tiny details on the horizon way before you'd see them on the DVD or on a standard TV.  The movie is epic and has never looked crisper and more beautiful.  Details in clothing and sets are sharp and lifelike; you feel as though you can touch the world of Arabia.

B005GY0Y8S|5.0|After reading the most recent reviews ... I questioned my verdict on this book but what the hell .. 5 STARS .. I'm looking forward to reading her next book.  Being a bit of a francophile may have influence my rating but.. as I got into the book I found it unusual and I couldn't figure out how it was going to end until it ended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is probably one of the most terrifyingly compelling and twisted books I have ever read. The book is overall easy to read and the plot line seems uncomplicated. Nick Dunne is accused of killing his wife, Amy Dunne, and throughout the span of the book, Nick is trying, with the help of his loving twin Margot, to prove himself innocent. It is split into three parts. The first is simple enough. We get glimpses of Amy's diary entrees, which span over 7 years, and then we get Nick's point of view in the present as he struggles to convince the public (who all believe he is the oh-so-familiar guilty husband) that he is innocent. Without giving away any spoilers, the second part is just...wow. I did not see that coming. As for the third part, lets just say that although things wind down, you never shake off that creepy crawly feeling. This book is dark, and its humor is very dark...in a good way, of course.<br /><br />Books like this one are very rare. Flynn really wants to make people's skin crawl with the intensity of her characters. He astounding ability to construct real-life, believable characters is what makes every event in this book seem so bone-chillingly possible. You'll find yourself questioning how well you know those closest to you. Flynn gives you enough information to make connections throughout the book and you think you've figured out her game and then BAM! She hurls twist surprise your way.<br /><br />Amy and Nick are full of flaws, just like any regular couple. Just like any regular couple. Wait a second... Amy and Nick are not regular, not by a long shot. It is mind-boggling to me to think that I found myself hating one of these characters so much, yet Flynn was able to make my change my mind and become sympathetic with them in just one chapter. Her character-development is unbelievable and seriously messed with my brain. Again, I don't want to give away any spoilers but the second part of this book really sheds a new light of perspective on the events in the book.<br /><br />I would recommend Gone Girl for anyone who craves unexpected plot twists and seriously deranged characters. (Or \\"A\\" seriously deranged character.) This is totally worth the money and the read. It will leave your insides numb and have you second-guessing everything that you've ever known. Because of the language and topics covered in here, proceed with caution and know that you will get the most out of the book if you are at least 15 or older. As stated in an earlier review, regardless of your literary diet, Gone Girl traverses genres and does so deliciously!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great to pass the time. Each level is a new mystery to solve. I was hooked and could not put it down until I went through it all. The new levels can not come quick enough!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is back on game with another formula novel.  It reminded me of his earlier writing, predicable.  I enjoyed the read.

B0001GL3K4|5.0|An excellent series of love stories of all sorts, all intertwined and well performed.  A really fun movie to watch.
B004HD61KE|4.0|The release of nanobots created through arcane ancient technology, as Lovecraft would say, literally threatens the world as the micro-robots voraciously eat through to the magma below while triggering sympathetic eruptions elsewhere in the world and the Sigma Force struggles to get ahead of the crisis.  A long book which will keep you entertained with a story that rolls along rapidly while Sigma Force tries to deal with the nanobots by deciphering Thomas Jefferson's coded messages to Meriwether Lewis.  Meanwhile, they are dealing th a voracious, power-hungry conspiracy with roots in the distant past.  I thought the the author could've strengthened his case for the connection between nanotechnology and an ancient origin but the story did pack a punch, was eminently readable, and had a satisfying ending.
B00BLSAM3A|5.0|With blu ray the picture quality is fantastic. Better than when I saw it in the movies back in 1981.
1451666179|5.0|I simply couldn't wait to purchase this book! Rumors of its pending existence (one day) finally came to fruition when I witnessed the posting on Allie's \\"Hyperbole and a Half\\" FaceBook page. So...I quickly ordered it. Within two days, it arrived; nestled in its cardboard carriage. I couldn't wait to open it, and tore into the first few chapters at once. Since then, it has been a tug-of-war with my wife (who noticed it on my desk that evening). Now, I fear that I will have to purchase yet another copy. Well...so be it.<br /><br />Funny, witty, charming, and down-right hysterical, each chapter is an open door to Allie Brosh's life experience; from up, to down, and back again. With captivating and whimsical (almost grade-school quality) drawings, the result is simply a delivery of perfection in an age where over-digitized and well manicured artistic renderings are the norm. Without question, these artistic portrayals give the reader a genuine connection at all levels, from age to education, and reveal some of the most honest and genuine processes of the mind that were penned to paper. I cannot think of another book that so perfectly characterizes this process, and renders it in such an unmistakably well-balanced form. Its execution is flawless.<br /><br />Brosh simply makes things, well...simple. She has the ability to craft her writing from the most simple thoughts that go through our minds, and execute them effortlessly on paper. It's not as though we don't all do this, but the vast majority of use typically throw such thoughts into the proverbial \\"bin of unnecessaries.\\" Brosh takes those random and ill-adjusted thoughts and puts them on paper. Herein lies the genius of her technique. The subtle, yet poignant reference to the actual manufacturing and contemplation of thought that occurs in us all, and the ability to regurgitate it with incredible precision and style. The result keeps the reader captivated, laughing, sometimes tearful, but always satisfied and engaged.<br /><br />The pressing and manufacturing is very well done. Each page is printed on heavy stock, and the color is stunning. The book's jacket is heavy, as to brush-off general handling with ease. Perhaps the only complaint, is that the book's outer cover is a simple white with yellow lettering on the spine. Kind of difficult to read from a distance.<br /><br />So, if my family is reading this review...then you know that you're all getting a copy of this book for Christmas!.<br /><br />The pressing and manufacturing is very well done.

B000H7J9QM|5.0|Fantastic picture quality. With blu ray it almost feels like your in the movie. Add in surround sound and the movie comes alive.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Carlile is a great musician and she has a voice that is astounding. I think she should have more of her songs from this cd played on the radio instead of just My Story. I liked the whole cd.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I decided to get this on Amazon when I noticed that this is the ver.1.0.0. I love this crazy game but not the last update on Google play. It works ok but, I can't use a hack on new update. (Set phone clock 1day ahead to get property money each time you do it and get filthy rich). I dont like IAP after spending $7.00 allready. Update ver. is full of new stuff and graphic tweaks are good also however. Big bang for the few bucks.
B003HE2B9E|5.0|Great songs. She is so bad to the bone with that guitar. I try to play guitar and I couldnt even come close to competing with Orianthi. Her songs pull your heart strings and the guitar sounds like it is talking to you. She will be a guitar legend.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I took a chance with this book based on the price and genre. The author needs to have the book edited as there are numerous spelling and grammar errors. Also, the book is not written with somewhat of a closure like most books in a series. It was as though the author wrote one huge book and broke it into parts forcing you to purchase the next book to hopefully gain some type of closure. After a purchasing a few of the books I grew tired of the errors and lack of endings in the book, so I stopped purchasing them.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|It works good and it plays my movies and music without fussing. The player has lots of settings too so you can customize it.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Incredible show, a work of artistic genius. The cast, writers, and crew have created a new perspective which makes the story more unnerving than ever. An absolute must-watch.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Great Hardrock band. I like the way the music goes from hard rock to a regular rock style. The songs are perfectly mixed with great songs.
006202406X|5.0|Perfect condition, delivered THE DAY the book came out. I had it before all of my friends, even the ones that bought it day of! Yay veronica roth and amazon!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this app because I like to be able to look through the bible and this kindle is always with me. This gives me access to the bible without having to carry my kindle and bible around. I can just carry the kindle.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It never showed up on my nexus 4 - Asking me to describe in detail for this is pointless the app did not arrive.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I cant read a novel on my phone because the screen is just too small to stare at for hours at a time. This is a great application however, when I am reading a book I just read it on my kindle because the screen is larger.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|Inspirational and engrossing true story about the great side of human nature during a dark period of human history in WW2.<br />Highly recommended.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Great book and the price is free. I like books that make you think and show us what life was like before my time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|it works if you don't have one these types of software get this one! it takes little space and does its job.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so fun. it's like Hay Day. i love it!<br />my 6-year-old son loves this game. he plays it all the time.
B009O2XY12|4.0|So fun! Very cute and simple format yet no easy road. You have to think and it keeps you interested.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Tried for hours to install it.  Went through all the router settings.  Google help was no help.  Returning it tomorrow.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game. Play it for hours it is so addictive. Keeps you interested with each new level. Been stuck for some time now and still keep coming back.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I downloaded the Weather Channel App because I'm very weather conscious and consult it regularly. It has proved very accurate. I know what to expect and am rarely disappointed by its prediction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever. I can't imagine anyone who would not love this game. So addictive you will dream about it the first week you play it lol.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|As a Christian who believes we all have a purpose for living, this book help put that fact in a non-religious context. A wonderfully motivating book.
B004USRLRS|1.0|By the time I listened to the first three songs I felt I knew enough about the writer as I wanted to know.  I figured the rest was the same.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool .It seems a little like temple run though. but it has so much more adventure.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It turns out it's not really free.... after you get to a certain point, you have to pay to continue, or wait an allotted number of minutes to get ONE more level.  I don't have time or patience.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I really like the way the author makes me understand and learn about the Royal ways and there life's. I have red all he books nd there all so good.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|This film is very good in showing similarities of babies development with different cultures. It still lacked a little something to rate it an excellent film.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|Of coarse the first movies are generally better that the later ones, but this movie is good. Would have said great, but it was not as expected as the previews shown before it was released. It's still a good movie.
B0009VSB06|1.0|This was at a super low price a few days ago and I jumped on it.Amamzon said they would send it when it became available again for the price stated.Recieved an email today saying they would not honor their original statement,and that they were cancelling the order.this is total B/S,they advertised something,realized the price was too low and have backtracked with excuses of not available from the seller.Amazon has no honor and if I do not get what I ordered for the price I ordered I will be cancelling my prime and looking elsewhere for my stuff.I am sure I am not alone in this and we all need to make noise about their unfair practices. UPDATE. Just rceived an email from so called customer service offering $10 for their lack of honor,Told them they could stick it where the sun don't shine and have cancelled all my orders and subscribe and save. Oh yeah, and if you try to cancel prime membership they will not let you until the period ends,which is august of next year. Just another example of how classless Amazon has become!! Unlike Costco who will refund your membership in FULL if you decide to end membership with them at ANY TIME! Guess I am going to have to brave the hordes at Costco in future.Better than being insulted by amazon. It's only my small protest but I could not continue giving them my hard earned money after the way I have been treated. Good luck to you all.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Adventurous fun movie for all ages; It reminded me of the cartoon Flintstones, which takes place in the stone ages.  The Croods are not that developed as cave people, but what they discover about life outside of the cave and their reactions are funny.  I though this movie was going to be stupid.  I was very surprised.
1476733953|4.0|Nice easy to digest chunks of a story - great characters and an interesting setting. He really sets the scene of life in the silos.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|SK is one of my fav story tellers. I always enjoy getting list in one of his books. Dr Sleep was reminiscent of his earlier book, The Shining, which I liked the book as well as the movie.
B00CEF014E|5.0|A suspense filled thrill ride. An unpredictable and expertly woven story about a girl lured by a cult. You are left unsure of what is real and what could be the construct of her own madness until you reach the surprising and well conceived ending. Highly recommended read that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|Everyone has that one movie they can watch over and over again with it never getting old.  That one movie that's your go-to on bad days to make everything better or good days for an old favorite.  This movie is that movie for me.  I can't even begin to say how happy I was to see it on Prime (I'm six hours away from home at school, and my copy got left at home).  The story is a great modern-day fairytale, the cast is amazing (you'll be amazed at who pops up - even Russell Brand and Burn Gorman have brief roles!), and the design is wonderfully whimsical.  It's a story about growing up and discovering who you are on your own terms.  It's about believing in yourself and accepting yourself just the way you are.  It's about not being afraid to change and take life into your own hands.  Penelope may be simple and sweet, but I think that's what makes it work.  It's a modern-day fairytale full of charm, and it's definitely worth at least one watch (most definitely more).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So fun. Time goes by fast..wish there are free life's instead of buying or playing on facebook.  Being timed out is stinks..don't have time to wait so I play again at a different time.  All in all love the game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book came to my attention as I was presenting at a conference.  I loaded it onto my kindle and started reading it without much attention to the background/author.  I work with adolescent oncology patients and thought the dialogue & worries seemed about right.  To be honest other than some oddly phrased sentences here and there it could have almost been a memoir rather than a work of fiction.  Great book, easy read, poignantly express struggles of these adolescents.
0321146530|5.0|Kent Beck gives an awesome introduction to test driven development, with examples that are easy to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning test driven development. I would also recommend this book to those who are not.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm so bummed season 4 isn't legally available in the us yet! I will be anxiously awaiting to see what happens
B004LPLU4K|1.0|This was not the movie as advertised. The picture on the cover of this movie is different from thr actual title that played.
B00ELOOYZI|2.0|Simple Rockets is an incredibly fun game , but it messed up my Kindle Fire. Be careful when downloading this app.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Slow but well worth it! Its a really good movie! If you are a fan of either Sandra or Tom it good to see them together.
0793518326|3.0|Very Thorough and seemingly accurate, but the print is far too small to use practically at a keyboard or music stand unless you have one of those elderly magnifying sheets.. With that being said,  I shipped it back because I bought it so I could learn some Beatles songs on my piano.. Would probably make a wonderful coffee table book, and I applaud the publisher for wrangling all those songs though, wonderful thought.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I am enjoying this series and its main characters.  I like the foxy postmistress, who seems to know everyone in the town.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Wonderful, his voice, lyrics, music.<br />Most of his in US heard about him through the film.<br />Knowing his story makes the music pretty triumphant and joyful<br />even the sad society songs. You listen and just wish him, and his family<br />all the best in the world, happy they seem to have so much joy  in each other already<br />Living his words, he is such an example to all of us
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|motivating story of encouragement. dreams and desires can be accomplished ... regardless of the hurdles of life. should be required reading at all levels of education.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Superb animation - nearly lifelike. Story has a couple of slow spots, but overall, exciting action for a PG flick. Very precocious teen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great way to unwind. Fun and aggravating at the Same time.  I love the game. Awesome.  Great way to challenge your friends<br /> Awesome and challenging
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Good family movie, keeps everyone's interest and is lots of fun. Reminds all of us why we should stick out the hard times in a marriage
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! Great for all ages. Does not promote violence or sexual. Great for young children and adults.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was beyond thrilled when I saw that candy crush was finally available on my kindle. I love this game. It's addictive and lots of fun. My sweet son even plays it. Yay!
B003WUYP56|5.0|If you wish to get an understanding of String Theory, this is the only book  I have been able to locate which is readable and very well written.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|jude law, nicole kidmann, rene zellweger.... what more could you ask for.  just zellwenger's interpretation of rose is worth watching the movie, but everything was great.  the questioning of fighting a war  - and the questions in the minds of those involved - was right on.  great music.....
0061714372|5.0|This is a really easy to read book. Mustaine doesn't over complicate anything. He gives you the dirt and more and if you're a fan of Megadeth you'll definitely dig it. There's something awesome in reading a book about one of your biggest influences and favorite bands and how everything began and almost ended. Highly recommend it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Interesting blend of history and drama. The author weaves a tale around very differing levels of society leading up to and including the first world war.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This album is very versatile. Steven Wilson proves to be the master of his craft here using both heavy elements and the right amount of atmosphere thus creating a soundscape that weaves a story with a soundtrack. Perfect for anyone new to the band and anyone who just loves them.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|I love this game  Have both Fruit Drops but get frustrated when they freeze up.  When will this be fixed?
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Bridget Jones fans will be upset by how Fielding has destroyed Darcy's and Daniel's character.  The most exciting thing about the previous books was how a normal girl could attract 2 attractive and successful men. Killing Mark Darcy and  Daniel being a drunk....come on. It seems Fielding is using the name \\"Bridget Jones\\" to get fans to buy the book.  This book is nothing like the other books.  I will not buy another Fielding book.... Get disappointment! Shame on you Fielding for using Bridget Jones fans to sale books and make money.  This book is not worth reading!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Loved this movie! It was dark and twisted and each character played their roles to perfection. The small details were amazing, a must see!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great dystopian novel. Relevant for today too in many ways especially in regard to government control of public life.  Can't  wait for the movie!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Some of the mannerisms and speech cadence was odd. The plot itself was new and interesting. The directing was the issue for me. I think a different portrayal of the same story would have made this 4.5 stars easy
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game!!!!<br />keeps me interested. not like other game. love how u get things fast nd easy. fun fun fun
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised. Don't waste money on more expensive smart TV devices. The Chromecast has everything you need. Just plug into the HDMI port in your TV and you can stream netflix, hulu, youtube, and anything that will play in the chrome browser on your PC.<br /><br />It really is the best option for turning your TV into a smart TV.<br /><br />The only thing that could make it better is more support for tablet apps, and a screen casting mode that shows anything on the screen of your device. However; nothing really has this capability so it's not really a complaint.<br /><br />The only thing that beats this would be a dedicated laptop that is connected to your TV, but of course that is a bit more expensive.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Keeps freezing up and is very hard to operate overall bad choice for a camera or recorder...wouldn't put it on again
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|I still have not received this product. I don't no why it is taking so long. I ordered it a very long time ago.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun!  It keeps you coming back every day to take care of your horse and to compete in different events.. you also have the opportunity to get more horses which teaches you about more responsibility.. lots of fun ...!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The movie is almost here, so I had to refresh my memory about the details of the book. Only took me two days to re-read it but I'm glad I did. I remembered some important details about the games and what happened to our supporting characters. I really hope the movie does the book justice. Suzanne Collins wrote three amazing books that tell such a rich, vibrant story you fall in love with it every time you read it! Catching fire supplies details, Mockingjay ties it ALL together in very wild ride! READ them ALL!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Lots and lots of action with a little bit of romance it was definitely one of the best books i have ever read
B005E89X7E|5.0|Really enjoyed this whole series and can't wait for the next book in The Warrior Chronicles to come out.  They've all been a really good read. Sometimes graphic and brutal but realistic and well written.  Would definitely recommend reading the Series.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|One of the most detailed books I have ever read! The plot was excellent and the characters well developed! This will be the first of many novels I expect to read by these talented authors!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun way to kill time. Exciting and not boring. I was glad when kindle finally added the app. I wish it had been sooner.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very good graphics and realistic. New levels easy to attain. Like the weapon choices. Only thing I don't like is having to use real money to get the best weapons.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I absolutely love this show!! its has it all action, drama, a bit of romance, horror and suspense. There is never a dull moment and it keeps you glued to the show the entire time..
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Wonderful story with a thrilling climax!  He is a master at keeping the reader spellbound and utterly unable to predict anything.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Problem with charging is on my kindle not the charger. Kindle lasted twenty months. How sad is that? Amazon's solution- buy a new kindle or someone's reconditioned one. Don't think so... Charger prob ok but didn't solve my problem.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great series! The underlying plot with the main characters makes the individual episodes more interesting - you get much more depth than a typical cops & lawyers type of show.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|On the Kindle, this becomes a real addiction!  Love this game! Great color and graphics.  Personally, I turn off the music and sound effects. A bit too hypnotic for me.
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Funky Not Great but watchable. Broke version of a men in black for the dead. Wait for Prime to watch it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The movie glossed over all the years of training & agony that Ender experienced. Also, the rivalries between his armies & all the others was very well done in the book. I enjoyed this book & would recommend it to older teens & adults alike.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion is an entertaining and visually excellent movie.  The idea behind the movie is reasonably clever, the technology is visually interesting, the actors are top-notch, and the action is generally good.  There's not much to the story but it is well presented and easy to enjoy.  Approach this movie looking to have a good time, not to see an epic sci-fi masterpiece, and you'll be fine.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I am very pleased with the fit, utility, quality, finish, and protection this case provides. I am easily able to access all the buttons and plug without trouble.
B000FC0O7M|4.0|Growing up as a kid watching the Gemini and Apollo missions is what first sparked my interest in science and engineering.  The other kids wanted to be astronauts; I wanted to be one one the engineers in Mission Control, ideally the flight director. Astronauts went into space once, twice if they were lucky.  The engineers in Mission Control got to go on each one (or so it seemed).  I wanted to know what it was like to ride into space with a headset, an oscilloscope and a chart recorder.  Having to make life and death decisions in seconds or fractions thereof.<br /><br />Gene Kranz's book has finally given me that ride.  Kranz tells of space exploration from the controllers viewpoint. And what a view it is, from the 4\\" flight of Mercury-Redstone 1, to the first Moon landing with Apollo 11 and the death defying flight of Apollo 13 Kranz allows us to live the adventure that he and his fellow controllers lived.  The computers of the day were too big to place in the spacecraft.  The computers controlling the craft were in Houston and a successful mission meant relaying results and limited code from Houston to the craft and vice versa.  Poor decisions could mean a failed mission or worse, dead astronauts.  The pressure these men lived under was tremendous but they took it on willingly as they believed in the cause set for them by President Kennedy - To place a man on the moon before the end of the decade.  They worked 12 & 16 hour shifts, lived at the Johnson Space Center during missions, skipped vacations for years leading up to that first moon landing.  Kranz tells of how the pressure could take a toll on the controllers and their families but the mission always came first.  Mission training for both controllers and astronauts began months before the actual mission.  Simulations were run to anticipate common and not so common emergencies.  And they were run again and again until the right solutions came almost automatically.  Much of the pressure would be blown off at informal beer laden mission debriefs at a local biergarten in Webster or by various physical activities.  In Kranz's case he took up judo with a couple of other controllers to help blow off steam.<br /><br />Kranz is quite humble about his own role as flight director for Gemini and Apollo.  While a believer in strong leadership, his concept of that is someone who provides his team with clear goals and objectives, the tools needed and then gets out of their way.  Kranz truly believes in teamwork freely acknowledging that any and all success he had with NASA was due to excellent collaboration of a complex team of astronauts, controllers, contractors and administrators and the support provided by his wife Marta and his Catholic Faith.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars?  Let's face it, Kranz writes like he talks - in the short clipped speech of an engineer or better yet a flight director.  To be honest, its more like hearing him telling stories while sharing a beer.  Still let's face it, he lacks the eloquence of Tom Wolfe in The Right Stuff.  There are times I was aching for him to broaden the tale and give us more of the back story.  However, except in rare occasions, if Kranz didn't experience it, he doesn't write about it.  I was almost shocked that he doesn't tell the story of Alan Shepard needing to urinate after being locked up in Mercury-Freedom 7 for over 4 hours prior to launch.  I would have loved to known how the controllers reacted to that request.  There had to be a lot of scrambling, and contradicting opinions floating about on that one (they finally told Shepard to go ahead and go in his suit).  Still there are times when Kranz rises to the occasion.  His description of Armstrong and Aldrin's descent to the lunar surface was riveting.  I was right there in Mission Control, holding my breath with the other controllers only letting go when Neil had placed the LEM down with only 17s of fuel remaining.<br /><br />In the end, it's a great read by a great and humble man.e man.
B00D91GT48|3.0|Let's face it, the Superman franchise has been historically weak compared to every other superhero franchise- Spiderman, Batman, and Iron Man. So the bar wasn't exactly set high for me. One reason I believe this has been the case is that Clark Kent is not your bad boy Tony Stark, nor your reckless billionaire Bruce Wayne, or the underdog Peter Parker. He's just Clark Kent, the well-manered alien with a  passive personality who is always restrained in his actions. Great person to be around in real life, not so great for the big-screen. But the movie was just ok in my eyes. Will satisfy the special-effects buff, not so much the hardcore Superman fans. Script was weak, Cavill's acting was ok not great. His emotions during the acting scenes seemed as unrealisitc and distant as I've seen in recent memory. I really wish they had worked on the story more, I just didn't find it engaging nor worth watching over and over like I have for other superhero franchises.
B00E981K1W|5.0|Have never done a good drawing in my life but I'm going to now due to the lessons in this book. Got through it inside a day too. Now it's time to practice!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|sentinel did not dissapoint.  sometimes you are both so excited and scared to read the end of a series for fear that it wouldnt end right and there would never be another chance outside of fanfiction to fix it.  This was so not the case with Sentinel.  My questions were all answered, my curiosity satisfied.  i laughed, i bawled my eyes out, i was angy, i was scared, i was taken on a rollercoaster of feels until the very end and the feels i am left with are satisfaction and contentment.<br /><br />This is one of JLAs best books to date and I am grateful to have discovered this incredible series.
B00ESNE696|5.0|The characters are acting very consistently in the context of their characters and bad things are happening as short of an inevitable Greek tragedy,  Very much worth watching, even if it has gotten quite intense.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really fun great app recommend to all who enjoy apps like this the graphics are great as well so realistic
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|At this point we are mostly watching it to see how it all ends.  Definitely has lost the verve and sheer fn of the earlier seasons, which is unfortunate because, when it was good, it was very good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game but some of them won't let you go on. Of course it wants you to buy things to help yourself to proceed. So you get stuck for weeks on one game! That's not a good thing. But overall a good challenge!
B003FSTN52|5.0|I love this show!<br /><br />It is also on amazon prime.  I got hooked after the first few episodes and am watching current episodes now.  The show clearly has great writing and it is interesting how the main character, Alicia, gets back into the working world after her husband is caught having affairs while in office.  The show has comedy elements, drama, and a lot of current topics embodied into the show story lines.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch her character evolve and face challenges while she is raising her kids, sorting out her love life, and interpreting the law to best suit her current clients.  Also Josh Charles is on this show and you can't go wrong with him!<br /><br />This show is definitely worth checking out!
B006LRUVUA|4.0|It works pretty well on my Kindle, but you have to have Version 6 or higher on all your units for it to work.
B008BIZBIY|5.0|Plextor, the best you can buy. This is a very quiet drive.<br /> The seller sent the PX-891S.A.W. drive because they did not have the S.A. version. I am still not sure of the difference and it really doesn't matter. It still has the same quality and functionality as my older 890SA.<br />Simply stated, I only buy &#34;other&#34; dvd drives in an emergency, otherwise &#34;Plextor&#34;<br /> I bought this drive from &#34;ALB&#34; (in Germany) I expected a long delivery, but did not get it. It arrived very quickly.<br />Do not hesitate to buy from ALB. Very good service.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|My son is a big fan of Luke's.  All the songs make you think of spring break and all the things you do during break.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Like other bad habits, I watch this weekly and while it is not good for you, it is fun to watch.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great Story...... Great actors.......Keeps you wanting more!! Right up there with Grey's Anatomy and Breaking Bad in my opinion. Not violent but very entertaining. Well dressed cast, professional speaking/acting.......just love this show.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This was really a crummy movie.  Not as good as Walking Dead, and that is saying something.  Don't try to apply reason to the Zombie apocalypse.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|A complete review of the politics and American life pior  to World War II . A good review of Anne M Lindberg.  Would have liked more about Eleanor<br />Roosevelt. Will recommend it to my Brother who fought in WW II and also lived thru this period of time.
B00G32TD98|5.0|I loved the story, but you can tell where Hollywood added some stuff in for dramatic effect. However the true effect of this movie is the terror of reality. While it does have the traditional bangs etc the true terror comes from the fact it happened. Thus it can happen to you. The actual people said that Hollywood refused to put in the most terrifying events, and I really don't like that. One of the reasons is it would be too scary. I feel that in order to defeat evil you must know what you're fighting. Also the adding into the story for drama, especially at the end was a little disappointing to me. But it's all very well done.The film makes it clear that not only does God exist but so does the devil. Without forcing religion down the audiences throat. The acting is great, my only complaint is I wish it was longer. If ever I wanted a movie to be three hours this is it. The moral of this story is beware what you wish for. Since, like many people today, the stars of the film make a living looking for the paranormal. Problem is no one ever asks what if we find something, and what happens if it isn't Casper? I also loved the fact this movie presents a much needed breath of fresh air into the horror genera by making an intelligent, amazing story. It challenges man to rethink his beliefs. I believe in God, but you can't have one without the other. I'm not arrogant enough to think that in this vast universe we're all alone in this life or the next.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is good to play or just watch someone play it you will I LOVE THIS GAME SO WILL YOU<br />.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am hooked on escape games, and this one is very good. Very challenging but not too easy. I would love more levels.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Once again Sai King has written  great novel by taking characters from an earlier novel and placed then in the present.  Dan Torrence, the little boy terrorized by ghost and almost killed by his insane father in the Shining returns as the hero and title character in this novel.  As a constant reader I am always amazed how King can weave a tale using this technique.<br />Long days and pleasant nights to you Steve.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Movie is an all time favorite! Love it! Filled with energy and laughter. May consider buying it in 30 days. Thanks!

B00FPH51LQ|5.0|I love Jeff Bridges and he never lets you down. his acting was outstanding, by far. This was the best non-antimated movie of year in comedy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book offered fascinating detail of the life and tribulations of the 1st century Jew living under the oppression of Roman rule with a sincere, devout hope of being saved from the corrupt priesthood and their Roman oppressors. I really enjoyed the depth of discussion about the many other self proclaimed Messiahs of that period. The discussion of Paul and his influence on early Christian thought is profound.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The storyline was ambitious (if not a bit convoluted at the end), but I felt like the acting and sluggish pacing left it lost in translation.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Could not put it down  Mesmerizing book Wonderful read.  The characters are well written and fleshed out.  Truly subject matter to make me think.
1937053571|5.0|I can't even remember the last time a novel affected me as deeply as &#34;Sentinel&#34; did. My stomach was in knots the whole time I was reading it while I waited for that horrible moment when everything falls apart and my favorite character dies horribly or doesn't get their happily ever after (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter/Allegiant). I'm happy to say that wasn't the case with this novel. I laughed and I cried, and there were some really really painful moments peppered throughout, but Jennifer created the perfect blend of hopefulness, forgiveness, and tragedy. If there's any book that exemplifies the power of true love, it's Sentinel.<br /><br />The ending was completely different than what I expected, but it was absolutely perfect. I loved Alex and fell even harder for Aiden, and even came to like Seth too. I actually want to curse Jennifer for creating such a swoon worthy guy who could never exist in real life... DARN YOU. I'm really sad it's over (honestly, I'd LOVE to see those final scenes in Aiden's POV), but there's a great sense of closure and rightness with the journey. These characters have wormed their way into my heart and I don't think they're going to leave for a very, very long time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|A negative twist, dirty cop with a heart.  Life on the streets in its rawest form.  Captures interest on how the team will get out of the next crisis.

B00A85EMVK|5.0|What is there not to like?  One of the best movies of the 1980's reproduced on Blu-Ray. I highly recommend it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Thank you for giving us a wonderful ending. I was so thankful to cry tears of joy instead of tears of anger. I am so happy to have discovered these books as well as all your other books. You are an incredible writer! This book did not disappoint and was worth every penny.
B001NN4162|5.0|This is one of my grandchildren's favorite movies.reproduced in high definition blu-ray DVD.  Brilliant color and high definition.  I highly recommend it.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Don't bother with this one<br /><br />While the writing is fine, the multiple plots are confusing and a lot of the action preposterous.  Some is so over the top that it be a sketch on SNL
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Good movie, just a weaker version of Men In Black but very funny to watch. I would recommend this movie.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Based on a different time on people who have more money and time than sense. The characters are people all of us know in life. Makes you want to take time off and go fish.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and challenging. I know it is free but there are to many things to buy if you are not careful. I just play until I pass every level. It may take time but it is such fun.
B0001Z53F6|5.0|I'm one of those listeners that simply cant understand why more surround sound mixes aren't being done.  Yes, I know all the reasons that get bandied about, but I just don't want to believe it!  Great songs, performances and recordings (new and old) should be presented in surround.  I truly believe it's like stereo compared to mono, color to black and white.<br /><br />This record (the surround mix) is one of the most amazing rock music collections I have heard.  It is stunning in a lot of ways, but if you think Keith Moon is a great drummer, the surround mix makes you realize he's even better than that.  For those of you who think he's sloppy and thrashy, you must listen to this.  The spaciousness of the surround mix allows the details of the playing and singing to &#34;breathe&#34;, you are there with the band as the music literally fills the room, as it would if you were there.<br /><br />Some complain that the surround mix goes too far in this way, and changes the character of the music of the &#34;Tommy&#34; we grew up with.  I agree that the &#34;character&#34; is changed, but I feel it's different in a great way, as if you are hearing Tommy for the first time.  No doubt that the excellence of the songwriting and playing allowed Townshend to create two different interpretations of the same material.<br /><br />BY the way, Pete Townshend did the surround mix, and there is a 30 minute feature in this set where he tells you how he did it.  You also get the original mix remastered at 96khz/24 hi res audio.  Thunderous through a nice playback system
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Love it. Challenge  is fun there is also easy help if you need it. Keeps the mind active/ Get it and enjoy.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I have not read this book yet, however I anticipate it will be enjoyable and entertaining. Since amazon requires reviews I felt I should write something appropriate and nice.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I purchased this book after multiple recommendations by friends and many great podcasters and I am so glad that I took the time.  I read it in about a day and a half and I feel like it gave me some actionable advice I can immediately start applying. As a military service member, I know that systems are always more effective than people and I love the emphasis on building the systems in your franchise prototype. If you are looking to start or improve your business, invest $10 to read this book and build a plan that will work!  Good luck on your entrepreneurial adventure

B00BD99JMW|1.0|So disappointing. I know a lot of people are saying this, but if you have read the first two books in this series and invested in the storylines of the main characters you should not read this book. I understand as an author wanting to have an ending that is unconventional, but the ending to this book was insulting to the reader. I doubt I will I read another book by this author.
0307463745|5.0|This is a great book on business, filled with straight-forward advice.  Relevant to any business owner, developer, dreamer... a great read all around.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Excellent app so far. No problems, easy to use, unobtrusive and worth having on my new Fire HD. You won't be disappointed.
B00G32OER4|5.0|The conjuring was a fantastically written storyline and a fun ride that carried you all the way through the plot. One of the better scary/thriller movies I've seen in long time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly.  I bought this so that I can stream youtube since my Roku doesn't have that capability.  Just plug it in and start using it.  I also have a PS3 that you can use to watch youtube, but using the PS3 remote to type in a youtube search is tedious.  Using the chromecast with a tablet is very easy!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|A life changing book that took me through a transformation as I read. Clear, concise, easy to keep reading and really hear (read) what Steven Pressfield was trying to convey about &#34;Resistance&#34; coming against your dreams and ambitions. No matter what it is that you are endeavoring to do in life, Pressfield, in essence says, choose to keep going, you will encounter resistance to your dreams, but keep going. Resistance is a mandatory part of the process for dreams to come true.

B00BAXFAOW|2.0|Disappointing read from Gladwell.  Did he really research or just make assumptions (e.g., Goliath having acromegaly). Tone is one of being talked down to.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Easy clear reading, very entertaining, a must read for all ages junior high to seniors, stuff you need to know to thrive today
B004JMY312|4.0|Great classic movie for the Halloween season. Just campy fun for the whole family.  Nothing too scary for the little ones to be worried about.

B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Compelling narrative and horrific forecast of the future in store for our smart phone, Facebook, Twitter society. NSA spying society.
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|Good for a watch or three, probably spread out across a few weeks and then you can forget about it.<br /><br />The deadpool guy needs to learn some other type of acting other than &#34;Smart alecky guy who thinks he's too good looking to actually be serious in ANY role&#34; but he does an ok job in this film.  Hard to tell if its his fault, 2 guys an a pizza parlour plus various plot changes fault or the fact he's acting opposite Jeff Bridges and just doesn't compare.  If only they had stitched his mouth closed in this one....<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, the Dude, Starman, The Fisher King, Tron and countless other films man this guy delivers in.  Here he's pretty good in a film that's more Men in Black meets Ghostbusters (both in plot and depth, or lack thereof) and the best parts have to be the banter between him and that actress from Weeds.<br /><br />As for her, barely know her work but love the gogo outfit she's working in the film, and as I said about the back and forth relationship she has with Bridges.<br /><br />I
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Cornwell's histories shine. I liked the book and ordered the prequel. I may go for the complete Saxon Tales series.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Wow!  I never saw this show during its run but I will say that I loved every episode!  When I have time I can't wait to watch it all the way through it again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  I play on my computer, my phone and now I can play on my Kindle.<br />I was so thrilled to see that after numerous times looking for it in the apps that it was<br />finally there. :)<br />Thanks for making my day.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It would be a great game if the levels didn't get so hard. I am all for a challenge, but when it takes me more than a week to get past one level then it is no longer fun.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great family series. Characters become real to you and are liked because of their quirks! Customs and the towns are wonderful!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Inspiring reading. A deep insight to his so passionate point of views. Excelence vs cheap proffitable products. Amazing human. God bless him.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Ever since one of my wife's coworkers mentioned this series and we started watching (from Season 1, #1), we've both been HOOKED! Not since Battlestar Galactica and Firefly have I enjoyed a series as much. We can hardly wait for the next Season to begin!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This is an easy to read book that clearly explains the reasoning behind the diet.  My husband and I are in our 4th week of the fast diet and have each lost 3kgs!  It's easy to incorporate in your life as your calorie intake is only limited to 2 days a week and the rest of the week we eat and drink (inlcuding wine etc) as we normally do.  And still the weight comes off.  Life changing!  Highly recommend the recipe book that goes with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Funny, witty and heartbreaking look at death and life and love. I kept thinking throughout the book. &#34;Real teenagers don't actually talk like this,&#34; (existentially intelligent and thoughtful - i don't talk like that myself) but I adored it. And I'll read it again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|while I do like the good item selection, the graphics are a bit iffy for me, anyway,  and the controls are really hard!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A fascinating and literate adventure into a fictitious mind boggling adventure by these two authors. The protagonist  prendergast  makes one want to know him better
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love this album - the whole thing is great.  Its few and far between I find a CD that I can listen to the entire thing without having to skip certain songs, but I really like this album.  Also, its great for dance  if you are into that.  I use it for hoop dancing and its perfect.  I'll be looking to purchase more of her music.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I'm still in the beginning stages of the book, it progresses slowly, but I'm hoping it will get better as I get deeper into it.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Despite being the biggest King fan you'd find, I don't think I ever used the word 'unique' to describe any of his books; but Doctor Sleep was - wholly unique in its concepts, themes, even characters, and so so unique in the way it scared the hell out of me. Stephen King's books have always been more than just &#34;boo! i scared you!&#34; for me, and I've hardly ever had to go searching for meaning. Even The Shining was not just about those scary special effects and Doctor Sleep is quite the same in that respect. It would be disappointing to people who read horror for the gore, the adrenaline rush and nothing more; who distinguish good horror from bad simply as scarier from not-so-scary. Well, you can't impress everybody; except that, after reading 11.22.63, Misery, Under the Dome, Joyland, it should be plenty clear that King can be amazingly genre-defying.<br />Doctor Sleep is a much more grown-up book. Whereas The Shining could be interpreted as a straightforward haunting, Doctor Sleep is anything but. For one, in The Shining, Jack Torrance is manipulated by the presences in The Overlook, Danny is scared by them. In Doctor Sleep, our characters have already been through so much; they're a lot more resilient, not quite as vulnerable. Basically, they don't lose control, they fight back. So while the focus in most Stephen King books is the psychological breakdown of the characters, the demons in them and the 'getting inside their heads and screwing things up', which affects the reader too; Doctor Sleep is more about concepts - scary, freaky concepts of life and death, the after and the in between, souls, 'ghosties' and most importantly, the shining. The idea of the True Knot, our undead villains, their strange tongue, is incredibly imaginative. And if you ever wondered just what the shining was, other than a convenient goosebump-inducing plot device, this book will make things much clearer. And, the book is the true ending to what started all those years ago in The Shining. Having read Doctor Sleep, I can't imagine how I found The Shining complete.ining. Having read Doctor Sleep, I can't imagine how I found The Shining complete.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game, must have took ages to make! Hope someone's thinking of making a sequel or some thing like it, graphics are pretty good aswell
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think this is a good demo. Yeah it is not too long, but it is long enough to try out all the features and get a feel for the game. That is the point of a demo. The full game is only about half the price of minecraft and is a good game.<br />One thing that might be good to add is an optional tutorial.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse has thought out every problem there could be in a stable, just awesome.The looks really cool, It must of taken an age just to get the horses right!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Brilliantly reconstructed from equally good but wholly different source material. King's own criticism seems fair but irrelevant since Kubrck's version manages to be scary-- a tough bullet to bite for most King screen adaptations. I'm a fan of this one, and I'm a fan of  the novel. Ain't much of a fan of King's miniseries version although I like parts of it (yes I'm aware that it's very faithful to his novel, no that doesn't necessarily make it more entertaining). Also, now that King's sequel novel, &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; is out, one can't help but wonder what sort of film or films will come of that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need to use your brain for something other than matching colors and shapes! Love it. Great for family team challenges.
B00AA7V2Z0|3.0|A little bit too juicy for my taste. Not much restraint. But very watchable. Cool opening sequence reminiscent  of the one in remake of &#34;the hills have eyes&#34;, another movie suffering from excess juice. Not important, but the star of American Horror Story looks like &#34;the ass baby of david schwimmer and pierce brosnan.&#34; --my brother. Ain't finished the first season. May like the show better or worse at that point.

B009MJUB7W|5.0|Fair Warning: I'm just going to post this in all my animal items needing reviews unless one of them stands out for good or ill.  My son has a built up a heck of a collection made up of Papo, Collecta, and Schleich, and Safari Ltd. My son and I, or he and his friend, have enjoyed playing with them, some for several years. As there is often a predator-prey battle, there can be some violent collisions, &#34;clawing&#34;, &#34;pouncing upon&#34;, etc.  The Papo, Schleich, and Collecta are high quality replicas--all good build quality, durable, wonderfully detailed, a good weight and heft but not overly so, and they have held up without any issues (as mentioned, I'll note any exceptions in the individual review).  The Safari Ltd. have suffered the most from the treatment, though the vast majority of those creatures have come through relatively unscathed. I'd say they're lesser quality i both durability and craftsmanship, but they are more than adequate for playing even somewhat roughly with.  If it has thin legs, or other parts, it might be better to go the Schleich or Collecta, as they really are excellent build quality. But for creatures without a lot of appendages or thin parts (say, a beaver), the Safari are fine, if not quite as nicely made.

1401938906|3.0|Hmmm, a little too cheery and elementary for me.  The author comes across as nearly manic at times.  Still, three stars because the premise is interesting.

B00915G6MG|5.0|The discs played well and were free from defects. My husband is a real fan and he is quite happy with this purchase.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Funeral grabbed me right away, with the first wobbly sounding lead guitar melody on Neighborhood #1. Neon Bible wasn't quite so immediate; it was Intervention that won me over, though I still consider this the most uneven of their four releases. The Suburbs, which has been essential listening for my wife and I since its release, took quite a few listens to sink in, and then become addictive. The two initially released songs - The Suburbs, and Month of May - really didn't impress until they were set into the context of the full album. It remains a masterpiece.<br /><br />And now we have the massive, dense, fascinating Reflektor. Similarities with The Suburbs - not so much in the music, but in the need to listen in full, quite a few times, for it all to sink in, register, make sense and embed itself into your mind - are striking. The initial release - the &#34;hit&#34; - Reflektor - really disappointed me a bit on first listen. But then the full album came out, it could be absorbed in full.....first listen of the full release gave me the impression of volume, density, and dance music. Where was the Arcade Fire of the first three releases?<br /><br />Then familiarity and acceptance set in, the melodies emerged, the brilliantly played and spaced instruments, perfectly fitted and harmonized vocals. Where the first few listens indicated a lack of a &#34;Wake Up&#34;, &#34;Intervention&#34;, &#34;Ready to Start&#34; or &#34;Sprawl II&#34;, subsequent listens made the songs pop, become distinct, and for the most part, exciting and memorable. I found myself going to sleep with snippets of the songs in my head.<br /><br />I like the generally different &#34;feel&#34; of the two discs - the high energy dance of disc 1, the more familiar, textured, complex atmosphere of disc 2 - but of course there are exceptions in both cases. To me, the masterpieces are found on disc 2, but I am sure with time it will flip, change again, and like with The Suburbs, I will find strength in allof the songs, depending upon my mood.  But, my, isn't &#34;It's Never Over&#34; a miracle of songwriting!

Kudos dev for the prompt response!<br /><br />[Original review 11.3.2013 below]<br /><br />Title: Uniquely fun puzzle game - but has Flurry Analytics add-on. Also newer version available for free in Google Play Store<br /><br />Pandoodle is a fun puzzle game that takes an unique twist on the gameplay found in Cut the Rope. You're given a limited amount of paint with each stage. The objective is to direct the paint to the appropriate colored target. Along the way, you have to figure out the most efficient paths so you don't run out of paint, and also how to mix the basic colors you're given to produce other colors.<br /><br />PRO:<br />After playing through the first book, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and addictive this game turned out to be. The cute graphics and soothing background music ease you into the game with the help of the nicely done tutorial. But the difficulty level picks up nicely, and the game quickly becomes deceptively challenging. The replay value is further enhanced with the 3-star system found in other games like Angry Bird. You will definitely want to go back and figure out the best way to beat each stage to get all three stars.<br /><br />CON:<br />The game includes Flurry Analytics, which is an add-on that allows developers to track how you use the game. It's not evil per se if it's used responsibly, since it can help the developers improve their product. The problem is, you have to place your trust in the developer. Personally I'd prefer to not have any kind of tracking in my apps or games if given a choice.<br /><br />Also, this version of Pandoodle on Amazon is 1.0.2 with 75 levels. It also normally costs $0.99 (it's free today as the FAOTD). Out of curiosity, I checked it out on Google's Play Store. Pandoodle appears to be free EVERYDAY there, and it's actually up to version 3.0.2 with 100 levels and more gameplay modes. I checked the developer's website - they have links to Free and Full versions of the game. The free link is broken, while the full version takes you to the Play Store page. I am not sure what exactly's going on with the Amazon appstore's version. From experience, Amazon apps tend to be a little bit behind in getting updates, but this is getting a little ridiculous.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Pandoodle is entertaining and has great replay value. It's definitely worth checking out. If you like it, it might not be a bad idea to head over to the Google Play store if your device supports it and download the newer version - you'll get 25 more levels and new gameplay modes, and it looks to be free everyday over there too!oodle appears to be free EVERYDAY there, and it's actually up to version 3.0.2 with 100 levels and more gameplay modes.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|Amazing sound.  The biggest problem I have with this is now I need new music because it's so clear it makes poorly-mixed music so obvious it's painful!  Use it with optical and you'll be blown away.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|An enthralling episode that will not disappoint. Plot and zombies are at their best. A definite must before the next episode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting, suspenseful and a real page turner.  I'm reading the entire series and have a hard time putting it down.  A must read for science fiction lovers.
B00C1BTWV4|1.0|The movie cut out the second time we watched it. And since it was only a 24 hour rental, we never got to see the end.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I use this for everything, it's one of the best Photo Editing apps I've used.<br />There are two things I can't do with this - add a color to a b&w pic (for example: turn a flower yellow & keep rest of pic b&w) and make a photo out of words.<br />If YOU know how to add a color to a b&w pic, or make a photo using words - will you comment or get in touch with me?<br />Additional comment, added 6/3/14<br />I'm having trouble with the free, in-app package add-ons (they're not downloading or installing). When I click the preview button, the preview gallery is empty. Out of all the new add-ons, (Mother's Day, wings, ALL quotes packs, ALL font packs, etc),  less than 10% work.<br />It really makes me sad. Soo many - and I can't play with them!<br />But, here's good news...<br />I learned how to install any fonts I find online into the PicsArt program!<br />Fonts like CHARMED, BUFFY, DISNEY, DISNEY, BLOODY... almost anything!<br />Playing with the colors has taught me some neat tricks, too!<br />My blog has never looked better.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|A philosophy to dance to as well as listen to.  Really fun<br />&#34;border&#34; tales sung to great tunes.  Deeply personal songs;<br />but always discreet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this game it's really fun but I think it should have more grooming things like washing ok.
0385537131|5.0|Sycamore Row takes us back to Jake Brigance,the main character of the John Grisham's first novel,A Time To Kill.In this novel,he is now defending the late Seth Hubbard's will,who gave most of his wealth to an African-American woman,Lettie Lang.Although the book can be somewhat be dragging and slow in the middle and too predictable at the end,it was definitely a fun novel to read.This will definitely be enjoyed by an Grisham fan.
080701429X|4.0|Another introspection generator.<br />Baseline amazing in terms of dealing with what life deals you.<br />Don't take anything for granted and appreciate what you have.
B00E1LQ7Q0|4.0|Justin Timberlake sound is gorgeous and sexy. This CD met and exceeded my expectations. Love his soulful sound and the mix of this music!
B009EEDJOM|5.0|Love it! One of our favorites. Ewan McGregor is a great singer.  It's both humorous and dramatic.  Gotta love musicals.
B0030MM68O|5.0|It is just a really good movie on all levels. I don't know what else to say, so just trust me and watch it.
B00563K3DA|5.0|I loved this book. It is so inspirational and it has helped me in so many different ways. I can't wait to start my new life, two seconds from now.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Her story is riveting and she tells it in a way that is captivating. Her courage and determination at the young age of sixteen is inspiring.
B001MM28JG|5.0|A good, mindless, predictable fun movie.  If you want to watch something that will make you smile for an hour and a half without having to think too much, this is perfect.  It pokes fun and just about everything associated with Star Trek.  Definitely worth your time.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is very useful to all of my organization needs.<br />I like it for all of the stories I write, notes for church, and shopping!<br />There is an app for this upgraded but, it's the same thing so don't pay for something that can be free!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Love Moriarty maybe even more than Watson and Sherlock! Gasp ! Such good villains please say it isn't so.Mycroft so much the ice man,and moriarty so crazy1
0446571415|4.0|This is the last of the Camel Club series, and I liked it as well as the earlier books.  The story itself seemed to, at times, be reaching a bit afar, but none the less the story is still a good read.  I liked it just perhaps not as well as the first books.  This is a good series, and I hope more will come in the future.  I'm enjoying Oliver's talents and friends.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|excellent series loved the mystery and unconventional ending .Really  a be careful what you wish for scenario.Good acting all around, Great suspense
B00ANDT3P2|5.0|I love this show! I'm very sad at they way the series ends though. But, I'll be happy to finally get closure when the movie comes out.
B004132HZS|5.0|So glad not the Jeremy brett sherlock! At last you can hate holmes because he is a s*** in every day life and just doesnot get it.Thank God everyone is normal and tells him off.Love Mycroft and Moriarty
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a must-watch and wonderfully entertaining and, may I say, addicting show that is  appropriate for nearly all audiences. I cannot wait for Season 4 to come along! Hurry!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the game that I have been waiting for! I love it...so much so I wish it was longer. I was pleased to see there will be a release of The Room 2 soon - by the end of this year. Thank you. Thank you!!
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|How is it statistically possible that one side (CPU) rolls AT LEAST 2-3 doubles in the ending phase of the game 90% (or more) of the time? I play against CPU level 5 and I think developers wrote the software such that it's harder to beat high level CPU because the dice is more favorable especially towards the end of the game. Dice isn't random.  That's a serious flaw.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The Fox network infamously mishandled this series, screwing with its episode order and time slot while not having a clue about how to promote it. Like many people, I caught up with the show about a year after its cancellation. Joining its fandom was a bittersweet experience, since I knew that I had probably seen about all the Firefly I would ever see.<br /><br />This Blu Ray set gives the show the attention it deserves. The scene commentaries are fantastic, making us feel that the cast and crew were and continue to be friends of the show, too. In addition, the video quality is surprisingly good, the show and especially its special effects looking better than they did in the original broadcast. This is a highly recommended series and version.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the size.  The history is a great feature.  Highly recommend this app.  I use it weekly.  A must have
B001KOFH2G|3.0|Oh, Serenity. You could have been one of the greats. You could have ushered in a new media model for sci-fi entertainment, showing how a mishandled network show could excel on the grander stage of the silver screen.<br /><br />Instead of standing on its own feet, Serenity comes across as a Cliffs Notes version of what would have been the next couple of seasons of Firefly. There are great moments, but overall, the results are diluted, choppy, and do not live up to the Firefly legacy.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Terrific read - Fact that reads like a well constructed novel, and deals with an issue that could annihilate the world. Highly recommended. Important book
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sanderson is an excellent author, so I joyfully tore through this book. it discusses the nature of power and how humanity responds to seemingly insurmountable odds, as described by excellent action sequences and dialogues.  I recommend this to anyone interested in the Sci-fi genre.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Didn't think this game would be as fun as it initially looked. As soon as I started playing it became a blast. Not terribly easy but not super hard either. Very enjoyable!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Thirlling and suspenseful. Pretty awesome how writers incorporate new ideas with honorable mention of the history of history of this most interesting story Thank you for the wonderful adventure of Star Trek.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Its a fun game! But there ARE a few problems;<br />1. Blood and gore, not for kids 10 and under<br />2. 1 hour or more to get full energy back. (Have a backup game ready!)<br />3. Stuff is not cheap, not crazy priced though, so don't get me wrong.<br />Other then those reasons, awsome game :)
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Good recreation of Jack and the Bean stalk.  The gigantic stalks and those giants above we're fantastic. Of course, a love story and courage of the man to save his woman, classic goodness.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|\\"If you make believe hard enough that something is true,  then it is true for you\\",  says Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster), by way of advice to little Kevin Gilmartin in Frank and Eleanor Perry's 1968 masterpiece adaptation of John Cheever's short story \\"The Swimmer\\".  The multi-layer film is all about Ned's capacity for denial and delusion.  He has convinced himself that by successfully swimming home through the succession of estate pools in his wealthy neighborhood, that he will restore his life to what it was before a series of self-inflicted misfortunes ruined him and broke up his family.    That Ned's regeneration is centered on swimming pools is appropriate, since bathing is an activity our culture associates with purgation and revitalization. But the cultural convention is turned on its head here and the successive soakings instead wash off layers of denial, culminating in a cleansing rain shower which reveals to both Ned and to viewers the full scope of the ugly reality under the veneer of his illusion.  Those familiar with the Michael Douglas film \\"Falling Down\\" (1993) will discover a shared story telling structure and similar themes.    In the film,  Ned's challenge has more layers than in Cheever's original short story.  Cheever used the swimming pools primarily as a metaphor, with Ned's life sequentially compressed into his afternoon odyssey.  The downhill slide of Ned's life is reflected as he moves through the neighborhood, his reception at the first pools is positive,  but at later pools is either neutral or bittersweet, and finally is openly hostile.  As he moves along his energy level drops and he gets physically colder,  by the end the once virile alpha male can barely stumble to the front door of his house.  In the meantime we are reminded several times that Ned is disoriented as to the season of the year,  just as he is disoriented as to the season of his life.    The Perry's insert an additional level to the film, one more centered on Ned's promiseto himself that successfully completing his quest will make his wishes come true.  By the time Ned articulates to Kevin that believing hard enough in something can make it true, we already know that in his mind fantasy has taken over from reality.  And we flash back to how his playful interactions with Julie Ann Hooper (Janet Landgard) were their most passionate when she was recounting her youthful daydreams.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|I have read Ender's Game and none of the others in the series. That said, this movie was amazing.<br />It did an excellent job of getting across the idea and feel of the book without following it verbatim. I<br />think this is a near-perfect movie. The acting was superb, the music was compelling, the sets were<br />detailed to a ridiculous degree (take a close look at the keyboard Ender uses when writing home),<br />the costumes were fun and believable, the cinematography was never boring, the pacing was great,<br />and the special effects were top notch. In short, for cramming a book into 2 hours, they did an<br />excellent job. The technology from the book that is in the movie is awesome, especially considering<br />Card wrote the book in 1985. The only problem with the movie could be the actual premise itself.<br />Note on content: it said the Lord's name in vain once, maybe twice. There was an \\"A\\" word and<br />maybe a few other PG-ish words. The movie does have a lot of violence, mostly involving kids. It is<br />no Hunger Games, but there is some bullying and kids fighting kids (other than in their combat<br />training); it is part of the plot, however, as it shows the the main character, Ender, developing as he<br />deals with the violence toward him. Other than this movie being delightfully entertaining, it does<br />have some interesting social commentary. I believe it has a good message as well, one that does<br />not glorify the violence. A must see for the whole family, keeping in mind it is PG-13.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|this movie had possibilities but never really made it.  Some things were funny but I guess it just was not to my taste. I was surprised that the actors accepted such a pathetic script.  Tried to be a remake of 9-5 I would guess but failed in my opinion.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Many intriguing story lines. Gives thought into how intertwined our lives really are and makes you wonder, &#34;what might have been.&#34; I will definitely recommend this book!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Took too long to get to the secret. Found that I lost interest then as the anticipation wasn't warranted. Did enjoy the characters &glad I finished the book as for awhile I didn't think I would. It is good not Great.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written.<br />Interesting narrator perspective. The story is moving and the characters believable. I would recommend this book to readers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to pass the time and challenge yourself. I would recommend it for people of all ages. I enjoy it a lot.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|It's Cher, of course I loved it. Fun album, I've listened to it a lot. Didn't really need the CG, but, that'll be a gift.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Nice change. To have it told by the mans side of things. Also it had laugh out loud parts, which had my family looking at me like I had lost my mind. It's worth the time to read.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Epic ballads.  Sing this on the way to work and arrive hoarse.  Scream it at the too of yoir lungs.  I like it.
074356619X|5.0|My shipment arrived in  just a few days and was everything I expected.  I would highly recommend shopping this way to everyone.<br />No surprises and no hidden costs/
B009GED3HS|5.0|Absolutely love this show!!! The 9th season isn't the best but still funny.  Season 8 might have been my favorite.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey was well done with excellent charter development.  I thought that the story lines were well defined and moved form one to the next with ease.  I enjoyed the look from the many points of view on the same circumstances. The change of the character point of view was interesting and  well thought outl
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Loved it!  Recommend for any Castle fan. Adds to the show and it's fun to try to recall the episodes it draws from,  too!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Awesome 4th season so far I missed this one had to buy this on amazon. Cant wait for the rest of the season
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I'm not really a fan of zombie movies, but I was surprised at this one! I hope they make a sequel!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I snapped this app up when it was free and so glad I did. Unlike the one that came with my Samsung tablet it does everything that I need.  Don't have to go through lot of steps to get $percent of something or off a $ amount. Worth every bit of the .99 quoted price. You won't be disappointed.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|Been looking for a way to listen to my favorite sermon podcasts from iTunes. Grateful for the opportunity to download and listen on my long work trips. Thanks for a great app!
B00632HWOG|1.0|This product is so poorly done I have had to change my email iver to Outlook. Com so I can get and use my email.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 5-year old daughter loves this game! It is a ton of fun for her and she absolutely loves the animations with the cute little voices from the characters when she gets an answer correct. This game is excellent for learning the alphabet, and learning to identify and recall different shapes and sizes. I highly recommend this app.<br />-Matt M.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game, some levels take too long though.  I will keep playing but cannot spend real money!  thanks for the fun!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Hated it....for a FREE game they started trying to get you to buy more right away.<br />I do not recommend it!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I cant believe it I got to play my best songs even lavender town is in here!!!!!<br />I bet Ill get much better at the piano now
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Good for passing time at the Dentist or Doctors office.  Kind of a mindless<br />match game, but makes time go by faster when you are waiting.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|When I purchased this cover they were out of stock so I had to wait. I saw the same case at my local walmart but for $12 more. I was gonna buy It but I didn't mind waiting a week instead to save the money. it came a day earlier than it was suppose to. I love my kindle and its case. ive had it now for almost 10 months. the elastic straps still are strong and the case takes a good beating from my purse but it still looks great. its soft and beautiful.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|THIS game is realistic it is the one of the best pinball games even the tree,wizard,and ghost looks real it's crazy plus it in HD the best I can't believe this game I never play a pinball this realistic in my life even the kids is going crazy for this game I am loving this game I don't think this game can get any better than it is right now
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting to be able to play this stupid ADDICTIVE game on my Kindle Fire HD for A LONG TIME. I only have one word to say about this.... ABOUTFRIGGINTIME! I love this game!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|My kids love this game they play it on a kindle fire makes car trips quiet...Will recommend this game to every one
B0094WK9EC|4.0|This cd has many good songs. Just make sure you pay attention to the road if you are driving. Don't be surprised if you are so lost in the music that somehow you miss a RED LIGHT and then you get a ticket or a visit to jail for the accident caused. You have been warned.<br /><br />PS: This \\"5 minute\\" a day internet session really sucks. And it is true what they say about the food.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is a continuation of the other. Books. Love it. This was a little slow but worth the pace. Good!!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was worried that I would be among the angry women who read this book.  Instead, I'm energized by this thought provoking and honest portrayal.  Having worked in financial services for 30+ years, I can honestly say that I've experienced it all.  We must fight on, men and women together.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|i love mini clip games and i love pool. the direction play is so easy and fun that is why i will play this game for a very very long time.
B004WR125O|1.0|I honestly don't know whether the problem was with the UWF-1 or the Onkyo TX-NR616 that I bought it for, but I could only get the receiver to connect to open wireless networks.  I tried a number of configurations, putting the access point right next to this dongle, using different wireless standards (802.11a/b/g/n) but the only thing that worked was to disable the WPA security mode.  The receiver worked fine with a wired connection, so the problem could have been with the USB port, the receiver's firmware, or some shortcoming with this dongle.  I'll never know because I'm sending the UWF-1 back for a refund.  There was no way to test it outside of the receiver.  It wasn't recognized by my MacBook, so must require a special driver.  Since it didn't work with the receiver it was intended for, it's worthies to me.  Too bad, because it's tiny, and seemed like a good solution.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is great, I have noticed after a few days playing I noticed During survival mode monsters such as the, Creeper, Skeleton, Zombie and Spider have no longer been appearing. If you have this problem reply if you find a reason why.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Both dragon vale and dragon story are free which means the games will want you to buy things but dragon story forces people to buy food or wait weeks to grow one dragon to its adult size and you must spend a lot more gold to clear land than in dragon vale. Also my opinion is that dragons in dragon vale are more cute than dragons in dragon story and I would dragon vale more than five stars if that was an option.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|great needs more maps and has only 2 5v5 maps and 1 3v3 but luv it! Try it and if you like it try Pocket Legends
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is a good game but could be better some how.It just doesn't have that THING to it .
B006HAPY26|5.0|I love the CHERUB series so much<br /><br />Perfect, better than I expected! I loved every bit of this book. Fabulous!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Terrible. If you enjoyed the first two books, save some time and a few dollars and imagine your own ending. The plot is muddy, the switching POVs are confusing, the characters are poorly developed and the ending renders the entire series pointless. I was so looking forward to reading the final story about the society the author deftly created over the first two books, but there was no good sense of place and it was difficult to understand the switching revolutions/counterrevolutions. The characters of David and Nita were ciphers—I have no idea who they are or why they did what they did. Worst of all, it was very boring, and it was very tempting to skim literally dozens and dozens of pages. And yes, I'm furious about the ending. Pointless and cheap!
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Mad Max is one of the coolest series out there, and this collection is pretty good.  The movies themselves come in one Blu-ray case wrapped in a tin case.  The tin case itself is a bit strange since it has an indent on the back side that looks like it could fit another blu-ray case in it but I have no idea what its purpose is (maybe stacking?).  Aside from he odd design, the art on the tin case is attractive and lends to the theme of the films.  The movie case is standard fare for blu-ray discs, with all three in one case.  The films play without issue and look pretty good.  My only gripe is the $35 price tag.  If this went for $20 it would be perfect.  Alas, these films cant be found for cheap anywhere and most retailers do not carry it in stock so this is the best option.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is challenging and fun with new levels being added all of the time.  I play whenever I can.
0785153942|3.0|I loved the Pacific Rim movie and I bought this as a supplement to get more on the back story of the universe.  On that front, it was really cool, giving a few stories about some of the characters and explaining the birth of the Jagger program.  I was not the biggest fan of the art style.  Although it looked good, I think a grittier style would have suited the material better.  That may be biased (the only other comics I read are Dead Space ones) but overall I enjoyed the story and the whole package was a good deal.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I am an optimist and I always hope things in which I choose to invest my limited time exceed my expectations.  Infrequently, I am rewarded for diving into something with the remotest promise, but this movie wasn't one of them.  I expected the movie to be predictable...and wasn't disappointed in that respect, but the actors and performances were so tired the movie lost my attention occasionally.  The dialogue had some humorous quips of the type you expect from the plot and the characters and that was &#34;comforting&#34;, but the long-promised and awaited confrontation between good and evil at the end of the movie could not penetrate the low-energy bored complexion the movie had assumed by the time it arrived.  When it was done, the feeling I was left with was, &#34;What else did you expect?&#34;.  Even after stating all that, I would probably spend another 2 hours or so on Expendables 3 if one was released.
1781164266|5.0|An excellent look into the art of Dead Space, spanning the three core games and Extraction.  Everything included looked great and the layout was spot on.  Even the cover art is a spectacular hero shot done over in black and red with the eerie blue glow from Isaac's suit.  The art is gritty and wonderful, a true must have for any Dead Space fan. My only disappointment was in the content for the first game.  When i pre-ordered the first Dead Space game back in 2008, I was given a free art book that offered really cool content and got me even more excited for the game.  Sadly, the art work in this book for the first game is almost exclusively from that pre-order book, with little other new content.  That was just a personal gripe because it is still some of my favorite artwork in the book.  Otherwise, this is great buy for any Dead Space fan.
B00FMJJ064|4.0|My brother told me to listen to her and i really like this album. Both instrumental and dub step people will love this.
030789701X|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this guide.  One of the best, most fully detailed guides I have ever used.  The hardcover looks and feels great (and HEAVY) but it almost seems like something you would find on the bookshelves in the College of Winterhold.  The integrated bookmarks are a great feature.  Such a simple inclusion goes a long way in this case.  The content is well detailed and the pull out map is detailed as well and BIG.  Everything is organized well and not much was hard to find.  I got this after pouring in well over 150 hours into the game and this allowed me to find so many secrets that had eluded me thus far.  Even at $35 this was a steal (it was $50 at the store) and I recommend it to anyone wanting the most out of their Skyrim experience.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. wish it could have been a little longer but it was still good. I ended up recommending it to my friend.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is an awesome app!!! Just there is one tiny flaw after the video is over it will go back to the previous video. But anything but that it is awesome!!!!
B005J2V74C|1.0|Pretty bad.  It's okay for playing in the background while working to drown out noise. lol.  That's why I watch so many movies.  I see what they were trying to get at with this movie premise, but it just failed miserably.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This might be his best book. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Great story and character development. Only read it as his new book is touted as a sequel to this one. Sadness, humor, history and commitment to right all combined to make a great story .
0061733199|5.0|This publication has a lot more information than i anticipated. Very thorough, and helpfull . Ole Lofty comes threw again .
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|GRISHAM HAS DONE IT AGAIN.  What an author ! As a southern boy wHO<br /><br /> went north ,this book brought back memories of the good and the bad old habits once prevalent in Mississippi.
B008JFUNJQ|4.0|Anytime I hear that a movie based on novel hit theaters, I'm skeptic. Aside from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter or Hunger Games, bringing \\"best-selling fantasy or sci-fi novels\\" to the movies never goes well. Yet, that doesn't stop Hollywood making these films. So hitting theaters this weekend is Ender's Game: based on the novel by Orson Scott Card. This big time sci-fi movie featured a big time cast and effects; but could these elements make this novel-based film a must see?    If you're like me, then you haven't read the Card's book.So in a case like this, you have to look at film's plot and how it works as a movie. With that said, this how the plot goes:  Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield) is a part of a military group that trains young minds to fight against the opposing alien force. Because of Ender's brilliance, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) takes a fast interest in the young cadets and see that Ender gets through the ranks so he can become the new hero of Earth.    While I'm not sure how this film fairs in translating the novel, I have to say the story does work on the big screen. The only issue I had with the movie is the pacing. As soon as the film starts, Ender's is already an accomplished student. Before you know it he is assigned to fleet training, then he moves to Salamander Squad; and as you turn your head, Ender has is own team. It was hard to get a feel in Ender's progression because the plot was moving so quickly. That out of the way, the story itself was impressive. I liked the themes used in the film, such as the conflict of war and the harshness of training. It was a solid war game plot, despite that the film's story may not have followed the book word through word.    Ender's Game feature an impressive looking cast; from young actors to veterans. As casts go, I enjoyed everyone. Asa Buterfield's performance as Ender was reasonable. He could have easily been a generic protagonist, but thanks to Buterfield, Ender was a brilliant cadet full of flaws and conflict.  Opposite to Buterfield was Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff. Ford has proven his worth over the years, but every time he steps into a sci-fi film, it's a treat. The same applies for this film as Ford plays a fully dimensional characer that you can understand and, at times, get behind. While actors like Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley even out the supporting characters, the real surprise came from the cadets. Sure these rookies didn't have loads of screen time, but their performances still worked and I found them just as intriguing as the A-list celebrities.    Continuing my impressed feelings about this film, I found Ender's Game to be a technically sound film. Going in, I expected the film to have big effects, but I didn't think they would look as good as they did. Not everything was gorgeous though. There were a few CG shots that could have looked better. Yet, for the most part, the effects blended well with the overall design; making a nice looking film. Steve Jablonsky brought his style to the movie's score, but while I could here Jablonsky's familiar sounds, I thought his overall composing fit the sci-fi film.    From the effects to the overall acting, Ender's Game had several great moments. If there were an scenes that stood out to me, it was the zero g training sequences. On several occasions, the cadets would compete against each other in this massive sphere with no gravity. The scenes were impressive by blending good effects with cool war game scenarios. It was like watching the Quidditch matches from the Harry Potter films; only on a bigger scale.    When I walked into the theater, I wasn't expecting much from Ender's Game. In fact, I was certain that the movie was going to be a miss. How wrong I was. Ender's Game is a great looking movie that is well acted and has strong themes in its story. I don't know how well the movie translated the book, but for what it is , Ender's Games makes for a solid sci-fi film.

B004ZN9OTG|5.0|I always imagine this particular Pink Floyd piece of music as if  Enio Morricone had taken LSD and came on board the Starship Enterprise. While there, he was heavily influenced by Klingon music. Epic. Best ever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ahhh. It is so good to have the best game ever right at our finger tips? It's soooooooooooooo annoying when other people try to make minecraft games, jack them up, then make minecraft look bad! So if u r looking for a game To download, with ten dollars to spend, GET THIS RIGHT NOW!!!<br /><br />Ps... 7.00!? Really!?
B00EE9A8OQ|4.0|I thought the new songs were Okay, but didn't enjoy them as much as their previous two albums (Metal, and Annihilator), the bonus cd which re-records some of their classic material, is fantastic.  The recording quality is SO much better than the originals. The bonus material alone makes the album worth it.  I also recommend Annihilator Live at Masters of Rock.  Excellent sound quality and setlist.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Monsters are always good.  Nice sequel to original Monsters Inc. Good for all ages. Teaches teamwork and truthfulness in all things.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Now THAT'S how you remix an album.  Vapor Trails is an amazing album, but recorded too loud.  It was distorted and not mixed well.  The new version fixes all that. The improvement is stunning from the first notes on the first track.  I usually do not notice a big difference between original and remixed recordings.  Not so here.  Huge improvement.
B009EEG8J0|5.0|Another Timeless and Funny movies for all ages. Another favorite of grand child. Robin Williams does Robot voice and brings great fun to his character. A must see.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device is so simple to setup and use.  It works with all of my devices (cell phone, tablet, laptop) with no problem.  I would have given it 5 stars if more apps supported it.  At the time I am writing this Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, and YouTube are supported. From what I hear though many more are coming out shortly.  Thank you Google.
B00APOSIEQ|4.0|Very good learning tool.  A little wordy but for the most part one of the best books I've read for CSS.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham at his best ! The book it's characters and plot are up and down right and left riveting writing and great
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|His best book yet. Each one gets better. His characters ring so true you would never doubt this retelling of a horrible time in the history of our South. It is a pleasure to follow this author and become more immersed with each new telling.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints! I am a loyal fan and have just a few more pages to go until finishing this e-book. Great story well intertwined with actual events. I have the Kindle app on my iPhone and the download was seamless. I love e-books because they are with me on all of my devices.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you are old enough to remember the Kennedy assassination as am I.
B0000A5BU3|4.0|Bowie seemed to lose his way in the late 80s/early 90s.  In particular, TONIGHT and NEVER LET ME DOWN were just awful.  But this album signaled a new approach to music and a re-energized, revitalized Bowie.  This was recorded at or around the time he married Iman, and it really sounds like the work of an artist rediscovering his own vitality.  BT/WN eschews concept baggage (which Bowie unfortunately picked up again in OUTSIDE) and focuses on song writing.  Some of it works, some of it doesn't.  The album is strongest when it tilts towards the jazz influences that permeate Bowie's entire oeuvre.  It's weaker when it tries to emulate 90s dance music.
B0018AM1ZS|5.0|This Soundtrack is amazing. There's no wonder why it won an Academy Award (Best Score, 2003). It combines the spirits of both 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers', then comes out with it's own. Howard Shore was definitely the perfect choice for these soundtracks. The world would be a different place if he hadn't orchestrated these.<br /><br />'A Storm is Coming' starts off the album softly, yet weary, then reprises (I bet you've figured out I like that word) the Theme for the Ring, end continues quite Hobbit-like, then reprises the theme for the Ring, and ends darkly as Sméagol kills Deagol. Then, 'Hope and Memory' is a quick, light track that is slightly rejuvenative, and reprises Theme for the Hobbits, then Theme for the Fellowship. 'Minas Tirith' is an epic track that starts dark and mysterious, then bursts forth with Theme for Gondor (at 1:40), then continues with an Elven solo, with a cautious, dark background, and ends reprising the Theme for Gondor. 'The White Tree' is another version of 'Minas Tirith', starting off quietly, growing louder, mysterious, then quick, and displays Theme for Minas Tirith. 'The Steward of Gondor' is a beautiful piece (unlike Denethor himself), which starts off quiet with a flute solo, and reprises Theme for Gondor, progressively getting louder, then dropping off as Billy Boyd (Pippin) sings 'Home is Behind' and ending both darkly and beautifully. 'Minas Morgul' starts off loud, and fast and dark, then slows and quiets, gets epic, then loud and fast and dark again, then later slows down again. 'The Ride of the Rohirrim' is slow, but awesome, reprising Theme for Rohan, then quiets down, and has a Hobbit-like flute solo, as Théoden refuses Merry to go with him and his men, but becomes loud and triumphant as Merry is picked up by Eowynn on her horse. 'Twilight and Shadow' is a soft piece which starts off with a pretty solo,  then becomes an orchestration of the same tune, and remains that way throughout the whole track.'Cirith Ungol' is a dark, quiet, deceptive piece, which then reprises Theme for the Hobbits, and continues dark as Gollum deceives Frodo into sending Sam away. Then, 'Anduril' is a track which starts slow then becomes loud with a reprise of Theme for Rivendell, as Elrond gives Aragorn the reforged shards of Narsil, as Anduril, Flame of the West. 'Shelob's Lair' starts dark and becomes quiet and creepy as Frodo becomes lost, then creepy/fast/vengeful, and reminds one slightly of 'A Knife in the Dark', then builds up creepily, and ends slowly. 'Ash and Smoke' is a cool piece that is loud with some soft solos, but with a dark undertone. 'The Fields of Pelenor' begins with a similar sound to Theme for the Fellowship, then gets loud and violent as the battle begins, with a reprise of Theme for Isengard.  'Hope Fails' is as one would expect: dark and sad and regretful. 'The Black Gate Opens' begins with might and valiance, reprising Theme for the Fellowship, as all but two of the remaining living members were at the Black Gate, then has a pretty flute solo, as Frodo and Sam climb Mt. Doom, and eventually slightly reprises Theme for the hobbits, but with a more end-ful drift. 'The End of All Things' begins  loud, and dark, and as if (excuse the irony) the end is upon us, as Men begin t lose the Battle at the Black Gate, then begins a reprise of Gollum's Theme, as he battles Frodo for the Ring, and goes back and forth, until it becomes hopeful and valorous, as the Eagles arrive at the battle and help turn the tide, as Frodo throws Gollum and the Ring into Fire, then becomes quiet and relief-filled, yet slightly sad. Then, 'The Return of the King' is Valiant and triumphant, yet humble, as all good things come about, reprising Theme for the Fellowship, then Theme for the Hobbits, and even Theme for Gondor. 'The Grey Havens' begins quiet, and soft, with a Japanese-ish flute, and continues triumphant, then reprises Theme for the Fellowship, then continues on and becomes slightly sad, yet genuine, reprising Theme for the Hobbits (In Dreams [not the song, but the tune]), as Frodo reveals that he will be leaving as well, then ends as all great Sagas should, softly, yet triumphantly, and humble, yet victorious. Finally, 'Into the West' is a good-sounding end to the soundtrack, which answers 'May It Be' and 'Gollum's Song', yet to the Theme of Victory from the movie.<br /><br />This album is just as good as both predecessors, unlike many Action sagas, and is arguably the most successful movie trilogy of all time (awards-wise). My personal favorite tracks are 'Minas Tirith', 'The White Tree', 'Minas Morgul', 'The Ride of the Rohirrim', 'Twilight and Shadow', 'The Fields of Pelenor', 'The Black Gate Opens', 'The End of All Things', 'The Return of the King', and 'The Grey Havens'. This is a definite for any LOTR fan, but as I have said for the first two albums: the price is a little steep for MP3 music, especially at $11.49. But it did win Best Score-2003.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Limited options. No general streaming. Google need to try harder and open up the streaming to other applications and more countries.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Freezes when loading level or going from one room to another. Love the game, but not the glitches. Rovio please fix.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|\\"Gone, Baby, Gone\\" is one of the best movies EVER!!!!  If you like sitting on the edge of your seat during a movie, and saying OMG over and over again, this is the one to see.  This is the fourth time I have watched this movie(one of my favorite) but it is the first time that I really understood and appreciated what a great movie it is with all the plot twists and turns.  Why?  Because, none of the other pay per view sites I have watched this movie on allowed me to view it totally without any editing.  There were so many scenes that I had never seen in the other versions I have watched- it was like watching it for the first time. Since I was seeing it with my daughter, who had never seen it before, it made it all the better.  Thank you, Amazon, for a totally enjoyable movie night.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Best show EVER! So addicting and worth it. Its a Must see. I can't wait for season 3 to see what happens next.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using the Chromecast for a little over a month now and I really enjoy it. I primarily use a Roku 3 for my Netflix viewing, but have been a bit impatient waiting for the individual profiles to roll out to Roku. Because I can use profiles on my tablets and computer, I have been primarily using the Chromecast for my Netflix viewing since receiving it. I enjoyed how easy it was to set up. It is a little annoying when I take it over to my fiancees house that I have to run through the set up process again, but it is a minor frustration and is really meant to be stationary. Both of us enjoy the ability to use all of our devices to control it and that we can swap controls so easily. We also enjoy being able to view our YouTube videos on the TV. The price point for the device made it affordable and low risk. I am excited to see what development is made for this device and which apps will support the feature. Between Netflix, YouTube, Hulu+, Google Play Movies and Music, and Pandora, it was enough for me to justify the purchase. I plan to eventually purchase a second TV and put the Chromecast on one and the Roku on the other. The tough decision will be do I put the Chromecast on my primary TV or my bedroom TV? I should also note that after a month of use, my fiancee has decided to get one as well. For the price and the current functionality, this is a great buy. With future support from other apps and services, the Chromecast is poised to be an integral part of the home entertainment system.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Always LOVE Kate Morton books and this is no exception.  You are always intrigued as to what will be revealed next
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works well, although I wish that there were more content streams available. I expect that time will cure that problem.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super fun. It makes you feel like you are actually raising you own horse. I love the training sessions and competitions
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finally closure to the shining story.  Nicely done, Stephen King still has what it takes to make a rounded out story.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What's not to like about Adobe reader.  It's almost impossible to exist without it.  This is an excellent add in to your Kindle.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|What can I say, it works as it should. I have no issues with this product at all. Great produce
0374531269|5.0|In the story &#34;A Long Way Gone&#34; by Ishmael Beah, the author lives out his normal day to day life. But soon all that would change when he gets news that the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) had attacked his town while he was away with friends. This news sends Ishmael into a state of urgency. He flees the village and encounters the government army, who trains him as a child soldier to fight the RUF. This memoir is gripping at times, a fantastic read. It perfectly conveys the feeling of terror that the author must have felt. The issues addressed in this book show that the world must pay attention to events like these, and try to help prevent them . The use of flashbacks and personal anecdotes help the story flow and make the author's thoughts crystal clear. It is unbelievable how quickly Ishmael adapted to killing; he had no regrets or reservations about murdering those who had taken his life away. Everybody mature enough to handle intense gore and trauma should read this book. It is an eye opening tale that will make you think about the relevancy of today's events in a global context, and will hopefully help the world realize just what these children go through.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Great show,lots of action and great sex action. A lot of drama. I like the polical parts as well. Love the old time drama.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Coins regenerate too slowly. You can only play for a couple minutes before you run out of coins. Then you have to wait 6 hours to regenerate coins! I look for good go to games that I can pick up and play anytime I want. I don't want a game dictating to me when I can play it and when I can't. Ridiculous. And I'm not stupid enough to purchase fake coins with real money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We loved the entire show. The cast, story line, settings and characters were just terrific. We normally do not go for this time period show but after the first few episodes we were total fans. We cannot wait for season 4 to be available.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Felt inspired reading this. There's not a whole lot of text to it; it's more like a series of blog articles (tips&tricks) which makes it an easy read.
0525478817|5.0|This book is by far the best I've read. The plot and characters are simply amazing, and the words really make you feel the emotions Hazel and Augustus are feeling. It's emotional at times, and there's a lot of complications in the book, but the characters get through it and that's what makes it the best book. It's about cancer patients, and all the difficulties that come with it. There is also a love story in it. You won't regret buying this.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This is one of the best movie for children and adults since WALL-E. Looking forward to watching in 3D later this year.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Works fantastic!!!  I had to put the camera (a GoPro HERO 3+) in a GoPro HERO 3 case so the BacPac would fit  but sure glad I bought it since I use it for underwater videos and still shots.  Great to be able to see what you are shooting.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Even though i read this book last year, i still luv it:)!!!<br />It is like the most awesomest book evah!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It has given me a glimpse of the Afghan society and what they ve endured during the last 50 years. I like the possibility to see it from a non-political point of view.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Also i read this book like two years ago but awesome! So complete thought five stars. I really love all of Rick Riordan's books.
B00005JCA9|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!!!  THIS IS A WONDERFUL ROMANTIC COMEDY - A PERFECT MOVIE FOR A COLD RAINY DAY ON THE COUCH.  :-)
B00G32OER4|5.0|A lot of great suspense and truly scary moments. I really enjoyed this movie as a horror fan. Nothing over the top or cheesy beyond the main monster. They could have stuck with vague outlines or the very creepy leg shots without relying on sort of iffy makeup to make the audience aware of it.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I got this app because of the &quot;if you can imagine it, you can create it&quot; aspect. Except, when a level requires, for example, 3 animals you'd find on a farm, the game tells you which animals to create. How is that making anyone use their imagination?<br /><br />I also really, really hate when I pay for a game, just to find that hey, I've got to pay to get past level 6, or I have to pay to unlock more characters. Would be different if the game were free up to level 6, but if I pay for a game, I want the whole game unlocked.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not really too thrilled with this purchase.
B000WN60NG|5.0|One of my very favorites. Glad to have it in my cloud. The music in the film is what makes it so great.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Got this app as the FAOTD, but after playing, this is definitely worth the dollar. I opened the game, just to try it out quick...and had to force myself to close it an hour later. Great for kids and adults alike, I highly recommend this app!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Not done reading yet, but they want a review. So I'm just writing this so I can continue reading. Thanks
B00881VLCE|5.0|great pictures and a great way to do a puzzle and not worry about missing pieces or where to do it and not have it be in the way
B00C7607BC|5.0|Love watching this wonderful love story. The music, the storyline. I love sharing it with my grandchildren, and having bluray and DVD digital works for all of my electronics.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is my grandsons &#34;most famous game in the whole entire world&#34;  His words exactly.  I got it for him and he never leaves it alone.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I have been a fan of Allie's for a while now, my favorite blog post of hers is &#34;A Better Pain Scale&#34; which I have seen in a doctor's office or two and they really owe Allie credit, and money!  Allie's book is amazing and it was worth waiting since July when I first put it on pre-order.  It's awesome on paper.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so excited candy crush is now available on kindle fire it makes playing this funfilled game even more fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it, but I don't like all the time outs, I lose interest having to wait for the clock to tick down.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|I like this app because when the battery is fully loaded it gives a little ring. Of course, not always am I right away around, but it is a nice feature. It also points out what to do to save usage of your battery/, but I have to admit that I use another battery app a lot more since the battery shows up big and with big percentage letters.
0062082841|5.0|Okay, this was one of my first Amazon purchases after receiving a gift card for my Birthday. I decided to spend it on Cabinets of Curiosities when I noticed it was up for pre-order. This book....is amazing. I ordered it because I love Guillermo del Toro and was expecting it to be interesting, but what I got exceeded all that I had hoped for. It is packed with information, sketches, and artwork. It's the size and weight of a text book. The quality is excellent and I can tell a lot of thought and effort went into it. I am very impressed and happy with my Birthday gift! You will not regret this purchase!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read every one of this author's books and have the collection in hardcover.  I have not really enjoyed some of his later books. I fell in love with his original stories.  This book was awesome just like the original books that I couldn't put down.Thank you Mr.Grisham I am eagerly waiting for your next one.  P. Matyas
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Keeps my 4 year olds attention, adult humor, loved the music and dancing.  The entire family enjoyed it, highly recommend!
B000QDA7OU|5.0|This was a wonderful movie and I found it very informative.  Audrey Hepburn was so beautiful.  She was perfect for the part.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|I must say this series is SO different then anything I have ever watched. It was so unique and entertaining..I did enjoy watching the episodes..cant wait to watch season 2. GREAT series!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A fascinating book!  And so well written!  I feel like I'm getting to know Abraham Lincoln and his colleagues in a way I never had before.  It's long, but SO interesting.  I'm actually reading it slowly -- feel like I'm &#34;devouring&#34; it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good Game.  It was challenging yet still solvable.  Also found that I could start at the first level after completing them all and still enjoy them a second time.  Ready for more levels!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This dongle has the unrealized potential to rival Roku; but it doesn't because Google is seemingly doing nothing with it. As I write this I can watch YouTube, Hulu and Netflix. Roku has dozens and dozens of free channels and is adding more channels all the time. If you are OK with just one or two of those then this will be a five star for you. However; if you are looking for variety I strongly suggest you buy a Roku instead.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app made a huge difference on my Kindle Fire. Cleaned out crap that was cached I didn't even know about.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun, wish there were more levels.  Held my interest and my son's.  Does anyone know when more levels will be released?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is one of those games that you can not stop playing, it's so much fun for the whole family, you will be addicted.
B003M70O5O|5.0|God Charlie hunam is hot. This series i fraking awsomw. This is the first time ive tried prime instant video and its awse.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Loved this book. Loved how the book let you visualize everything as if you were there. I do think the book is so much better than the movie.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Weather Channel does a good job for the most part... as accurate as any other weather predictions.  I also like the severe weather alerts.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|First off, as most Blu-rays, this movie looks beautiful in HD. As bad as a desk job and a one bedroom apartment seem, both look incredibly comfy while watching this comedy. If you're a fan of King of the Hill and/or Beavis and Butthead, this is a must.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book has me totally involved with the characters.  It was one of those books that you loose track if time and stay up way to late to finish it!!!
B00969PR18|4.0|This App works great with my Kindle Fire 4g unit. Google maps is a bit better but for the Kindle Fire it does everything well. I use it all the time with my job traveling looking up address and points of interest. Good directions from getting to point A to point B.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It was a fun watch. Like Superbad characters in a different plot with more cursing, sexuality, and violence. Also greater use of irony.
0385349947|5.0|Great book, read this for a leadership development program I am in and it has great insight.  Highly recommend this to young and old leaders alike.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|It was okay.....not bad, not awesome.....just okay.  Mildly entertaining.  Decent effects.  Goofy in places.  I'd recommend at the Amazon Prime price.....anything more than that and I'd pass.
030746363X|4.0|Bought this book mainly for the diet portion, great results and the cheat day makes sticking to it much easier.  I'd recommend this book to those who want to see great results and need some basic guidance without having to spend a ton of money on vitamins, supplements, etc.
0316017930|5.0|Eye opening relative revelations about age, demographics, religion, timing and luck as contributors toward success  But, the common denominator is hard work.  This is a great read, especially if you have young children because a parent can influence their child's success.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Enjoyable and somewhat intelligent zombie movie! At least treated zombie-ness as a legitimate issue with somewhat of an explanation. Brad Pitt was great, as always! Had that Legends of the Fall thing going on with his hair... Beautiful!
B001L1S1SK|2.0|One of the disks was damaged upon opening it. Could only watch half of each episode. Very disappointing. Especially since I bought all the seasons at once (not all from same supplier) and didn't find out about the damaged disk until I made it to season 3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is really a fun game and I also enjoy playing it!  Win or lose the  round it is fun, but I would rather win
B000002BFL|5.0|Dark and contemplative, slow and engaging, this is an unusual album from Springsteen.  Beginning with the  sad elegance of the Woody Guthrie inspired title track, the album depicts an America in decline and the damaged and hopeful characters who live there.  This is a perfect companion to the mid '80's album &#34;Nebraska&#34; - with its spare acoustic treatments and stark grey portraits.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|The video stopped  playing about half-way through.  After  trying several times, I  was  still unable to complete viewing the film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is easy to read. I do not have the best eyes. The bigger the better. It also has big keys to press, so you have fewer mess ups.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|It's one of my favorite versions of Over the Rainbow. I chose it for my ringtone so decided to listen to more of Iz's songs. Some beautiful Hawaiian music and I love the way he does Wonderful World as well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like it easy to use and I am very hard to wake up in the morning. So I am very lucky to have found this app.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Nathan Fillion! Ugh I want more so much more! This is just such a great show I cannot believe it only got 1 season! One of the best by Joss Whedon!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|… thoroughly  enjoyable, a wonderful evocative telling of a dramatic year in American history, particularly as 1927 ushered in the serious beginning of the aviation age that so much changed us and the world.<br />Love it.. and it has even captivated two very typical adolescents.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I loved this action adventure story in the vein of James Bond. Ian Fleming had a fascinating life and the author did a nice job of exploiting this for a fun romp across Europe and Africa set in World War 2. A great book to get lost in. I am now going to read the first book in the series, ‘Operation Armada.’
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Knowing it's not the same as the book helped me enjoy it more than a lot of people.  The movie itself was just OK, not terrible but nothing great.  Disliked the fast Zombies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm on level 12 and so far its a lot of fun.  I like that it changes games.  Cant wait to c what's next
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great and easy to use.  Replaced a dying GoogleTV box with it, so far it's much faster, easier to use and was basically plug & play to set up.  Can not beat the price.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Great movie!  John Wayne is wonderful, and Robert Mitchum is so believable as the alcoholic sheriff. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves old westerns.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|Not that interesting doesn't hold interest. Could be a better in explaining<br />What's to be done instructions not very clear. Not something I would recommend
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game almost every single day I've had it for about two years on my kindle fire I can't get off of this game
B000FA5STS|4.0|Great ending. The last 20% of the book I couldn't put it down. If you like Baldacci you should like this one.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The new robots bring a new essence to the game I loved the game after playing it for 5 minutes
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Loved the drama, actors costumes and music. Sadly graphic sex means it cannot be enjoyed with my family which is disappointing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|. The only thing that I don't care for is that when you get to a certain levels you have to pay or ask friends to help. Otherwise I love the Game and it is so much fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy to finally be able to play on kindle.  graphics are good.  fun game to play with friends. thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Greatest game ever . I'm always looking for a challenge and I would say this is it and looking forward to more games like this.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great storyline! Fantastic actors, fight scenes and drama can't wait for season 2!!!! Even learned some Norse history along the way
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I'm just a supper Crazed Bones fan.  I hope the series goes on for another 8 seasons.<br />I especially like that you, Amazon, had this great price offer.  This is the best price that I have ever paid for a season of any of the series I've purchased, and I have many series.<br />Thank you, Pamela J. Taylor
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved this book, well written and kept you wanting more. Shows that age is not always a barrier to a great friendship.Would definitely recommend it to others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great way to enjoy candy and pass the time. It's fun to see if you go back and beat your own high score after you have advanced the level.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is more addictive than peanut m&amp;M's. I can't stop playing and my daughter keeps begging for a turn. recommend for everyone
B00C68JXAW|4.0|No suspense, but hilarious.  This would be the Star Trek IV of the James Bond series.  New, different M, Q is whining about lack of resources and tells 007 outright that he'd join the CIA in a heartbeat, if invited.  And who doesn't like looking at Kim Bassinger?  Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera), the totally inept assassin, played the Clouseau part.  She reminded me of Madeline Kahn.  Rowan Atkinson played Nigel Small-Fawcett.  Need I say more?
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love this game.  Fire maples best game.  Easy to to get to the hints no having to go to a journal and find your place.  Love the music and drawings. Great story. More games please.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I often read a whole chapter and it is easy to do that by scrolling up. That is different than books on the Kindle.<br /><br />I wish it had the New Revised Standard Version..<br /><br />I like that it has The Message.
