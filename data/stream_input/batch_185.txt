B0041E9NMC|5|These are fantastic. I mean no one really likes holding gel in their mouths for an hour, but it doesn't taste bad, and they work so, so well. I used my first pack of 7 in about a month, and my teeth were sparkling. Now, about 5 years later, I split a pack with my boyfriend and I used the other 3 to kind of touch up. Highly recommended.
B000C1ZEY4|5|great product, wife has been wearing it for years and I still love it.
B001VMJSCW|1|I got acne after using it
B007PQYHJW|5|I have used this for a while with my red hair color due to not being able to wash daily! It works well and smells awesome!
B00B046VV2|5|I've tried dozens of razors over the years and keep coming back to these. They're gentle on the skin, but work on dense hair without missing any.
B008C4CQQW|3|Feels wonderful. Does not last though.
B0015TI57A|5|This is the best cream for my feet. It smooths out rough heels, soaks in quickly, and a little goes a long way. Love it!
B000WU38QQ|5|Love it!  Arrived quickly.
B000GD03TO|5|I am glad that this product exist.  I combine it with Dermastatin and I literally feel nothing!  I think a 8 0z can last me a good 2 months.
B005LQ2RWW|4|For what this is suppose to do, it works OK.  You have to bend and roll until you can figure out how the hair is pulled out.  Takes a couple of times (each time)to figure it out.  It's better than using the sticky facial hair removers that leave you face red and sticky.  The hair does seem to grow back a little quicker though.  It's small enough to take traveling too.
B00009LI8T|5|This is exactly what I needed!  I feel like my old self again! No more hot flashes…no more mood swings.
B00G3T0ICM|5|Smoothes out lines.I use evey night and they are reusable,stick very well and comfortable and they don't scare my husband when I wear them...
B00BP0WABG|5|Works pretty good. This doesn't completely numb a spot just takes it down a notch or two. Really helped when getting into the armpit area.
B001EJOPZC|5|I had one of these many years ago and I have looked everywhere for it. I was so excited to find it again. This is a great exfoliating back and body scrubber.  It is just as I remembered! Plan to order more for Christmas stocking stuffers.
B004US2POC|5|This is an excellent bubble bath, the smell is wonderful and the kids love it, it bubbles plenty and it is organic and cruelty free... can't go wrong.
B00756HQNQ|5|Nothing I have tried comes close to this product for smoothing heels.  Just be careful using it until you learn how good it works.  You can overdo it.
B000ONI3F2|5|I'm using this product in conjunction with Retin-A Micro cream and it's doing well with blending away my acne scars.  I am also using Clear in the AM and this in the PM.  It seems to be working well for only using it a month.  Shipment was quick and easy as well. I would recommend this product to anyone with discoloration.
B00AFITMVK|5|Where do I even start. This stuff is MAGICAL. I use this to seal my ends and when I tell you that my hair stays moisturized ALL WEEK? I mean ALL WEEK. I cannot tell you how big of a thing that is for me. I have 4c hair, so I have really been looking for something that could keep my hair nice and moisturized. Let me just be frank, YOU NEED THIS. If your hair is dry, YOU NEED THIS. If you think your hair feels like the Sahara Desert on its worst day, YOU NEED THIS. If you hair is shedding, YOU NEED THIS. If you want your hair on unicorn status, YOU NEED THIS. Don't even try to talk yourself out of this. Seriously. I know it's expensive but I am telling you right now, your hair will thank you. Use WAY less than you think you need and build. I usually use this as night, put on a SILK sleeping scarf and then go to bed. PLUS did I mention you can literally just massage this into your skin when you're done with your hair? You will literally smell like chocolate and sunshine. Who doesn't love that?
B0064GN2RW|5|It looks like others have had a tough time with these pumps which is too bad because mine were perfect. The tubes were not attached to the pump but WERE included and easy to put on. They were a gold color (not black, not clear). It was a little hard to get the pump to fit on the bottle but it's because the shampoo and conditioner were thick and it was hard to get them in the right spot. But once I got it on both Redkin bottles (1L) they fit snug and absolutely perfect. They're a good quality pump and I hope they'll last through several bottles of shampoo and conditioner!
B0086LC47M|5|These are the perfect addition to any serious nail art enthusiast. The small glitter containers are just right for dipping fingers without making a mess. There are a lot of colors that are very close in shade, but when looked at closely are different. This is good for someone trying to find a perfect shade match and maybe one of the colors is a little off, but the other is just perfect.<br />They came packaged nicely and didn't have a spill anywhere. The containers are in good condition and all screw on properly so no messes. I love that they are small so they can be packed away when i take my nail art boxes to friends parties. These have been a huge hit wherever I take them and people are always asking me where i get them!
B000F0JTTI|3|I don't really notice a change in the color of my eye skin but the puffiness went away. There are little globules in the product that require some incorporating. It dries very quickly and it flakes. I have very deep wells near my tear ducts so sometimes it was a struggle to remove the flaking.
B0026IJ1IG|3|It's white powder. It's got talc in it so you could maybe just use babypowder for way less but that would be easy to breathe in and that's bad.<br />Would give it a higher review but it's so overpriced. It is mostly talc, comes with a cheap foam pad instead of one of those smoother applicators. Have to use a *really* light hand or it cakes and looks patchy. Takes a bit of practice to apply smoothly and evenly.
B00O7UM4OY|1|The price was good compared to other brands. This one does not come with the case but was a good value.  The product works somewhat but not as good as some of the more expensive ones and is slightly better than regular mascara.
B000VP59FK|5|This is a great product for dry hands, legs & feet.  I use it for leg & foot massages - feels wonderful and has a nice clean scent.
B00DQ2IMIQ|4|These are very cute and there are a ton of them. Great deal for the price. Only problem for me is I was hoping to use them for crafting and they're very small which would make that difficult. Otherwise very happy with this product.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Works perfect and looks great doing it. 100% happy with this stand
B00942W51C|1|I really wanted to like this product but to my surprise it was junk. I a<br />Have a caramel color condition and this product has done nothing for me. The application is horrible.
B009LSMSK2|5|... I have a head of full, yet fine, and very straight hair - this product is my go-to for adding texture and volume, and to apply before curling to keep the curl. It smells like vanilla marshmallows and works like a dream. I like to use a flat iron to wave my hair and using this spray beforehand is the only thing I've found that actually maintains the waves - without it, the waves disappear within an hour or two. The salt in the spray adds a certain amount of dryness to my hair so it never looks oily, even if I haven't washed it, and the said dryness adds volume without making my hair seem too dried out.
B004GR79YS|4|Not sure about this oil. For some reason it helps with pains, maybe because it was time for the pains to go away or it is because of this oil. Whatever it is, it's working.
B00Y9CB55E|5|I am a senior citizen who is very particular about my facial products. The &#34;Glow&#34; products are amazing. This is my skin care program!
B006CREM3Q|5|I work outside,exposure to changing elements part of my life. I also have roscea with dry scaley skin, this cream is the first treatment that I see improvement with. Thank you!!!
B005OSQGN8|5|Whether you have a fogless shower mirror, or are looking to get your first one, you can't go wrong with ToiletTree's Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror. This is essentially the upgraded version of their basic Fogless Shower Mirror; this product is basically the same, except that it's bigger, and it has the distinct and most definite advantage of having a bright white LED led that goes around all four sides of the mirror.<br /><br />Installation of this mirror is a breeze - use the included adhesive, or do a bit of an upgrade, as my husband often does, with a bit of super glue (just make sure you're happy with where you're placing it in your shower!). When you fill the back reservoir with water, the temperature/humidity on both sides of the mirror is essentially \\"equalized\\", thus eliminating all but perhaps miniscule traces of fog. Water droplets may gather on the surface of the mirror, but if you periodically \\"pre-treat\\" the mirror with actual windshield washer fluid, you'll find that the water beads up and runs off a lot better.<br /><br />The LED light is white and bright - the lower setting is just fine, though of course depending on your bathroom lighting you may want to use the brighter setting (particularly at night). The lighting is a very nice inclusion, as it makes shaving (for him) and facial tweezing (for her) SO much easier.<br /><br />Last but not least, the included squeegee does an excellent job of cleaning the mirror surface.
B00BKSOKNE|5|Be very careful ... Super strong ... Use a toothpick
B000XE67IC|5|Love, Love, Love. Hard to find a good spray Patchouli.<br />Always had Jovan but was discontinued so this is a<br />perfect replacement.
B002K8W58K|5|This face wash has been helpful for clearing up my rosacea. It leaves your face very clean feeling.
B00APO3API|5|This is great! I am very pale. I use this especially in the winter. It gives you a little color with no rub off worries. It has a slight gold glittery sparkle to it. Smells great
B000OYJ9AO|5|Smells really good. Improved my skin texture. Helps moisturize my skin but not as long as the other lotion. But I will still recommend this :)
B001VEK1HQ|5|This was the correct replacement part and it works fine.
B00066N8ZM|5|Wonderful, love it , delivered on time
B003XDVER4|1|after using this, my tongue swelled, and tissue sloughed off from the inside of my cheeks and gums. This paste is frightening.  I am going back to Colgate total.
B008MCH5J2|5|Amazing color! Amazing quality. You can see swatches of this shade and other Trugels on my blog here - http://www.reneebeautygroupe.com/search/label/nails
B00G5WYD6Y|5|Exceeded expectations. Very well recommended!
B00I5H5Z1O|3|This product comes with the quality you expect from the Venus brand but it is a little cumbersome to use. Because Venus has sharp razors (which is a good thing), I felt like I would lose control of the razor with a shorter handle. Perhaps this is just a personal preference? The convenience factor is nice though. I brought it to a bachelorette party and it came in handy to have in my bag.
9749377397|4|Small tube of eye cream, but I do like it.  I will most likely order again in the near future
B004EDYQX6|4|The foot cream is a little sticky if you don't wash it off your hands after putting it on your feet (feels fine on the feet though). The almond hand cream smells WONDERFUL, as does the lemon butter cream. This is a good way to try several different products to what which things you like enough to want in full-size.
B00ICO345O|5|I have tried a few other waxes that just didn't hold well throughout the day. This wax does a good job of holding without needing to reapply throughout the day. It's a smaller tin, but I noticed I didn't need as much of the wax to get the hold I needed so it still lasted awhile before needing a new tin.
B006L2137U|5|I have sensitive skin and this product has not been an issue. Most sunscreens and moisturizers sting when I apply them to my face, not this one.
B001ET76AI|5|What a fantastic mouthwash.  It has no alcohol so it does not dry out your mouth like the other commercial mouthwashes do.  In the past I have suffered from tonsil stones, I use this oral rinse to gargle because it helps neutralize any odors.  The feeling of freshness lasts and I am not self-conscious to speak to people closely.  I would recommend getting it through Amazon because in my experience it is more expensive to purchase it at a place like cvs, etc.  It's a bit pricier but so worth it.
B00F5VQEJU|5|Nice glitter mix, great China Glaze formula.
B003I6MLN2|4|I was looking for new mascara, and decided to try this one, wanting to see if it really did create a \\"false eyelash\\" look. It was only around 5 bucks at the store, so I figured it was worth a shot. I used clear mascara first on my lashes to separate them, and then put on this mascara. It works!! It is better than any of the other mascaras I've used. It is a little clumpy, I had to go back with the clear mascara and work through the clumps. But it definitely made my eyelashes longer and thicker, after one coat. They look pretty long right now, I can only imagine with more coats! While it does not completely live up to it's title, my eyelashes are really, really long. Even the small lashes near the corners of my eyes. It is DEFINITELY worth it to try it out!!
B00126ZXPI|5|This item works as expected. Somehow it manages to sharpen the existing heads well enough to improve their cuts, and on very old heads, too.
B003ZWEW1S|4|No on/off switch so it has to plugged in or unplugged. Thats ok, more of a safety feature I suppose. Heats up slowly, but only takes a couple of hours on medium. Has done wonders on my Nurse hands and I am thankful to have it since my hands and cuticles were splitting. I use it about 3 times a week. I turn it on when I get up so by the time I get ready to primp, color shower etc it has usually melted quite a bit on high. The boyfriend has even used it a few times since he works outside. Cant beat the luxury of having it for the price.
B001711FMI|5|This will definitely wake you up, but in a good way.  Great clean smell and soothing sensation.<br /><br />Stronger and better than many other pricier brands.<br /><br />Will let you know where you have over-worked your shave.
B002GT361I|5|Used to use this years ago and thought I was out of luck when Cvs stopped carrying it!! Im happy to say I found it again!! Works great! Perfect for shine and sets all the fly aways. Isn't oily and smells just fantastic! All women should give this a try! Happy to have my beauty secret back ;) smells like my fav Michael Kors scent!
B00B1JK9EG|4|I got two blocks, instead of one black and one brown.
B00BUQ8KTG|5|This does the job in less time and that makes me happy. I would recommend this to anyone. Quick and very easy to use
B007S69QAY|4|The only thing I don't like is the clips for these curlers.  They're the comb-looking kind.  I prefer the wire clips because they don't leave creases in your hair like these do.  Other than that, the curlers are great.
B001ENIW7A|4|My 3 year old son loves to play Dr with this set which Santa brought for Christmas.  The lab coat really seems to enhance the experience of pretend play.  We all know how much kids like to play dress up!  The only item I was a bit disappointed in was the stethoscope.  The ear pieces are very large and don't stay over his ears.  Also it requires batteries to make an artificial heart beat sound.  I would have rathered the kind with the foam where they can actually hear something (like the Fisher Price one).  But other than that (which isn't a huge detraction) this is a great toy that I would purchase again.
B00JQF3L8S|5|This Brazilian hair feel good and look Good this what i been looking for i love this hair
B00MJ0DY20|5|Great quality makeup.  Highly recommend it.
B000FJ56SW|2|I thought, from reading the other reviews, that this color would be OK for me but it is still way too dark. I will probably need to dilute it with something else. I have medium fair skin.
B00GM0RD1Q|5|great price and smells great!
B00KVYBY8M|5|Great sheers for a great price.
B00IP42FBA|1|I just rec'd this yesterday. I was anxious to use it. I opened the bottle and it smells rancid. I wonder if that's why they're having a limited time sale on this bc it is old? I will be returning it and trying a different brand. Very disappointing.
B005FYKCKE|3|I have severe eczema and was looking for a \\"natural\\" remedy to help my skin heal. This lotion had many great reviews and looked promising. I tried it out and found that it really only helps with the itching. It's not moisturizing enough to be used as a primary moisturizer on my dry, scaly skin, but it does calm the itching most days. As uncomfortable as it is, I have found Aquaphor is the best moisturizer (though I go through the day feeling as if I'm covered in sticky honey). I've also begun narrowband UVB light therapy in hopes that this will be \\"the cure.\\" Good luck!
B008BHO53M|5|Great product!!
B0006UTYTC|4|The handle seems a bit heavier duty than others I have had, but the blade seems to cut less well.<br />I have only had it a couple of months, so I can't speak to its longevity.
B000P0IDYU|1|This does not create a lather unless you use a VERY LARGE amount which is very upsetting considering the price of the product. I ended up washing my hair with a different shampoo and conditioner again after using this as the angel wash and rinse just does not make my hair feel clean.  I felt like i applied product to the top of my head and washed it out with water didnt make my hair feel as if i cleaned it. Ugh will never purchase again.
B009JKIXRE|5|worth the cost
B005IYYF5E|3|Unless I misread the product details, I was supposed to be getting a blue polka dot shower cap. Instead I got a pack of 30 clear, disposable ones. I guess that can be considered a win, but I was kind of looking for something a little thicker, because my hair is extremely long and thick and is too heavy for these flimsy disposable ones.
B006WM860Q|5|If you want the top product to repair your hair, nothing beats this. As with all their products, a tiny amount goes a long way, so don't waste it slathering it on. I only use it one a week or so and oh the softness and shine!
B004D268RA|4|I'd been looking for a new face cleanswer and wanted to give this a try.  At 44, I have older skin more in need of renewal than strong cleansing.<br /><br />My first impression wasn't great for a side reason: the top wouldn't open no matter how long I twisted.  I really despise those twist open pump dispensers and this one irritates me to no end.  I had to throw away the top and because it isn't viscous, I end up putting too much on my hands.  It's far too expensive to waste that way.  I wish it came with a very narrow cap and spout instead.<br /><br />As for the product inside, it does feel gentle and I don't have dry harsh skin after use.  It has a very light and refreshing smell - more of a botanical green than anything flowerly, which is nice.  But as others have noted, it does seem to stay on the skin in a thin film and sometimes I can taste it later in the day. The taste doesn't bother me really - but I would like the feeling that I am actually washing the product off my face.<br /><br />Would I get it again?  Yes, definitely, I will.  It really does work softly yet cleanly and I can share it with my husband and daughter as well.  It's a great product for an entire family to use - rather than solely targeting women of a certain age or teens with skin problems.  To have only one bottle of face cleanser instead of 3 is a plus for us.
B0059F7C2U|5|Keeps my lips moist and conditioned and easy to apply. It also doesn't melt in the car on a hot summer day in Austin, Texas-which is a HUGE plus!
B00EKTOJEA|5|These are THE threaders to use if you have permanent retainers! The same feel as the ones I get from my dentist, they are easier on my gums than the pre-threaded floss kind.
B007MEOLHU|1|I order this product back on March of this year,I reordered again last week.the first time in march I  was 100%  satisfied with the product!I was amazed at the quality and the product it self. This time around I feel complete disappointment.the bottle was a cheap plastic container,the oil extremely runny ,(the consistency of olive oil) and barely any of the common castor oil smell. Never again I will order from these ppl again! No wonder is on sale!
B004DBUAOS|4|I dislike having to apply shampoo and conditioner separately.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and it doesn't break this bank! It also makes my hair smell clean without an overpowering smell.
B00CFT28G8|5|Goes on very silky, leaves skin feeling Dewey.
B000ZBPPF4|5|Good
B001BR3W92|2|If I had it to do again, I would pass on this purchase.  I stopped using it because the light really is not effective and actually impedes your vision if that makes any sense. I went back to my non lighted plain old mirror and am happier with that.
B00R31J4H4|5|I started using this about a week ago, I was really skeptical at first because I had been using another sulphur soap and ointment that was working great for my acne and u thought &#34;what your using is working, don't mess up now&#34;! However to my surprise this works better than what I was using, and it's cheaper! A definite win win! This ointment smells horrible, like really really awful, but it works &#34;magic&#34; on my skin! It clears up acne in little as 1 hour, seriously, this stuff is powerful. Try it, you'll be glad you did!!
B0015KHMRS|5|great price, quick ship, works fine ,use often, it is a very great item, use it it all the time
B001MA0QY2|1|This flat iron is mediocre at best. I have very curly mixed race hair and have used flat irons extensively, this one is no good. It didn't feel smooth during use and the results were frizzy and unacceptable. Best of all, the plug broke (we're talking complete failure with metal pieces falling out) after two, yes, TWO uses! It didn't pull my hair like other irons I've used but that might be the only upshot here. My advice is to save up for a quality flat iron and stay far away away from this junk.
B005Q4T2NQ|5|as expected
B00U9HW5UC|5|excellent
B00QL1ZJK8|4|I can see an improvement in the dark spots under eyes and on nose within only a week's use.  Does not irritate skin, as I have sensitive skin and will break out easily.  Hope to continue to observe improvement.  So far I am pleased with this product.  Did not give a 5 because I haven't used long enough to see an outstanding improvement.
B001ECQ3AE|3|I don't know what it was but I try to like Neutrogena as much as possible, since is such a good company for those of us that have acne prone skin. This oil free moisturizer was a bit greasy for not been oily.
B003ATS2QC|5|Have only had it a month, so longevity is not something I can speak to. I like it. The weight matches my weigh ins at Weight Watchers exactly so I believe it to be accurate. What more could you want in a scale?
B00JGRX97O|5|This is the best I have used, with buy again.
B00CJ26NEY|2|I have bought many hairpieces and this is one of the bad ones. I do not like the color, the way it pins into the hair or the shape. Try this one again!!!
B007KAXEXS|5|Wife and I first encountered this product while staying at a mid class motel while on vacation. We liked it so much that we looked for the exact item here on Amazon.com. I also purchased the same product that was glycerin based, same scent, same maker (San Francisco Soap Company) but no where near the same product. They also make a facial bar, same format, hotel/motel venue. We will purchase this again even if it seems like a sample bar. Nice scent,not too girly, works for my sensitive skin. Great product!!!!
B009ORTUDI|4|This review is for the Nude Beach Palette.<br /><br />This is a palette of eight  bareMinerals Eyeshadows of my favorite  eyecolors. This essential palette of pretty pink, taupe, copper, and peach is versatile. I can mix and match the hues to create different looks from soft natural to sexy and everything in between. It's pure color that's long wearing and blendable. This is a palette of soft, natural tones.<br /><br />This looks like a powder but feels like a cream. I use it with the brush and mix and blend to create whatever look I am going for. The colors are soft and subtle which is what I am looking for.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 06-20-14
B003BMI628|1|Weird quality. Wanted to return it back, but this seller didn't provide returns. Supposed no odor, but there is a weird distinctive smell of something old...Very sticky on the face, almost unable to wash out. Probably - not Neutrogena inside.
B00MWK6JTM|1|Product arrived quickly.  Product was a sample and was not intended for resale.  Strong smell to what looked to be discolored lotion, almost like rubbing alcohol... My skin had a reaction which reddened my face worse.
B00B9JTITK|5|Last year I had eczema on my leg. It was bad and the inflammation was getting worse every day. Ulgy, itchy, painful blotches. It hurt to put clothes on. Nothing prescribed by the doctors worked. I tried prescription steroids, topical and oral. Over a few months period, doctors tried combinations of medications including antibiotics and steroids, several different kinds of antibiotics. I tried other over the counter remedies. Still it kept spreading. Then I found Metaderm. I started using it twice a day. Within weeks I noticed a difference. First it cooled the inflammation and stopped the itching, then I started noticing it was shrinking! Now it is as if the eczema was never there! I never write reviews on products, but I decided this was something I wanted to share. It works!!!! I have since used it on my grandkids for a bee sting, and for hives, and again it relieved the problem.
B00016XJ4M|5|I love this. The smell is pleasant and doesn't last forever. Makes my skin feel good and clean. Will buy again. I use with Dr. Woods Castile soap.
B001FWXM3O|3|Stripper recommended this cologne to me.  It's price is not justified for the scent, at least not for a knuckle dragger like me
B006VMJDTA|4|I was excited to use this as it had good reviews. It definitely smoothens my skin and covers flaws very well. I have combination skin, and by the middle of the day, my face starts to shine, but it's easy to fix with powder. I am Filipino, so I am somewhat tanner than some asians, so this BB cream does come out lighter than what I want. I mix it with my liquid foundation to even out the color, and it works really well! Wish they had a broader color selection. Not everyone has porcelain skin tone!
B0045FYRDW|5|the color is so amazing 😍😍😍
B0049LUI9O|1|It was broken after less 10 uses.
B00A752CV8|5|I love it!! and since its metal I can widen it so that I can pick up lashes, I LOVE IT!!
B005E4A6KQ|5|These work great, and this travel case is a great value too.  These are much easier to use than floss, they are easy to use, do a great job, and were recommended by our dentist.  Teeth cleaning appointments have been a breeze since using them.
B00L1CALVO|5|I have many different nail plates from u.k etc. And these are the ones I always go back to. There are so many designs to choose from.
B001HC21VQ|1|I thought I ordered medium but got a larger I've used a medium for 10 years now but I'm sure it's because I pushed the wrong button on the phone
B00266WXO2|5|I've had mine a long time and I frequently get rave comments on it.  I ended up purchasing another one as a gift for a friend of mine.  We all love the fir balsam incense logs that come with the cabin....they smell like wood burning in the country on a crisp autumn day.  Heavenly!
B00ORXOOTO|5|I was hoping to find some good essential oils to use with the other La Lune products I've purchased- so I was very excited that I can now get Peppermint Oil from La Lune Naturals!  What fantastic value-- 4 oz of essential oils goes a LONG ways when you only need to use a little at a time.<br />I have so many different things I'm excited to try- scrubs, masks, cleaners.... but the first thing I did when I got the Peppermint Oil was put a few drops on a cotton ball in my laundry room, where I keep our cat food and our litter box.  It's amazing-- a nice, clean scent without being too overpowering and I can't smell litter or cat food at all!  I've tried so many different air fresheners and odor neutralizers and this is the only thing that's lasted more than 10 minutes.  Another awesome La Lune Naturals products!<br />Please come out with more essential oils-- I've been waiting to buy teatree, orange and lemongrass-- hopefully you'll get those soon!
B005TC9AOG|5|I like this product because it doesn't have an oily consistency, it is almost like it is water based. One of the tests I was advised to do on products that go on/in your hair is to put some of it on your forearm and observe how it absorbs. This allows you to detect when a substance is loaded with oil, which - in the case of hair - makes it water proof, which means that water can penetrate, but also oxygen, which your hair also needs to be healthy. After all, we human beings are 53.7% water based, so it figures that we need something with a high concentration of water to rehydrate, be it skin, internally, or hair, and that is what I look for with hair products in particular. You still need oils, just not the amounts that cause your hair to swim in it.
B004HGBS86|1|I wouldn't recommend this as mine broke within the first two uses! I was very disappointed as I liked the way it was curling my eyelashes, however, if you use too much force on this product it'll probably brake, it's so badly designed. That's too bad because I'd thought I had found a good product; I was wrong.

B00KOYK70K|4|ah this is pretty but its not enough to go the whole way around the hair so I should order another! It is pretty but you need to know that the long curly thing gets tangled easy if you move a lot. I noticed it started to do that after I wore it a day but hey they are do that I think. I really like the color and its full but I have a big head and a lot of thick wavy hair sooooooooo I cant blend this real well in my hair caus itts so pretty you can tell this isn't my hair! Im going to  pull my hair uptop and just use this without the blending of my hair and maybe if your hair is really thick get 2 as this says 3 fourths of a set! Its shiny and I would re order but I wish it were longer around for us who have a lot of hair and not a REAL small head!
B007O7AYYE|5|These real techniques brushes are soft , easy to clean, easy to use ,<br />The setting brush is nice for highlighting, blush and to set the concealer with a powder.<br />Honestly i dont want to use other brushes ( mac sigma, bobby brown) since i have them<br />I love them .<br />Perfect
B00L3R370E|3|This is a nice product but for me I need cooler base not a yellow base.  This is definitely yellow base to me.  So if that's what your looking for this is your product but I was disappointed with it. Also very light coverage.  I'm using it as concealer in specific areas.  Won't be repurchasing.
B004HR93DW|4|Goes on soft and smells yummy - not fruity just nice to my nose.  I don't see it &#34;staining&#34; my lips - the stuff in the tube is a nice darkish color however appears to go on clear for me.  Minus one star for no &#34;stain&#34; and also because it is more expensive that Burt's Bees Lip  Balm with Pomegranate Oil which appears to have the same effect for me as this tinted lip balm.
B00JGAHFIU|5|Great about smoothing lines..wonderful customer service.Received wrong product and was resent replacement without returning first product,Yay !
B00XD6M87Q|3|I have been told that their first run of this product wasn't correct. However, they have fixed the issue. I look forward to trying their new product.
B008FGVERY|5|Like most people, I tend to think my skin has weird and unique problems. After a few run-ins with rosacea and a visit to the dermatologist, the doctor confirmed my suspicion. I have weird skin. Oily on the nose, around the eyes, and on forehead while being bone dry on the cheeks. It also tends to react badly to even the most gentle of products.<br /><br />I started using the Max LS Daily Renewing Cleanser about a year ago washing in the morning after my shave and in the evening right before bed. Since that time, I've had no rosacea recurrences. I also haven't had any unpleasant reactions or skin irritations; using the cleanser seems to calm my skin down enough to allow the use of face moisturizer, too. Of course, your mileage may vary, but for me, this has been an good product. Maybe start with the smaller size or a tester from your local shop to make sure it won't disagree with your skin.
B00PAGS9ZW|5|Just what I needed Thanks for quick service.
B00LXKZV0U|5|Good
B001VEK1HQ|5|I just ordered this for a back up when it comes time to replace my old one so hopefully it will do what it is supposed to do when that time comes.
B00D1IUAQM|5|Gave this to my cousins for Christmas and they LOVED IT.  Perfect size and the colors are great.
B00A8DHI2C|5|Took a while to arrive, but these are great and the price can't be beat.
B00IKD3MX6|4|a little bit oily, but it gets absorbed over night, still kinda sticky after you put it on for couple hours, thats the only thing I dont like about it. I cant see the result yet, havent used it long. Hopefully it will help with my scars.
B002R2E16S|4|My son loved this now that he is bent on destroying his body!
B0086LC49K|5|These took some time to ship but overall happy with the product and ready to play with some nail art.
B00005B9FV|5|This product was recommended to me by a pharmacist. I tried it and love it! It isn't oily while giving my face moisture and helping with those pesky wrinkles that show up at times. I use it daily and really enjoy it. It's noncomedogenic too.
B001U3Y9VC|4|I love how much stretch it has. I'm a massage therapist and need to be able to move and this is perfect for it. It doesnt wash great though. Gets wrinkled pretty easy and the collar part gets bent to the side. But overall I'm happy with the product.
B00B1DRA94|3|go on very nicely but smudges if you rub your eyes a lot (which I do often throughout the day).
B000NG46Q0|5|This is an awesome shade of white! With the hint of grey, it is more wearable by itself compared to most stark white shades..
B00LKSVFI2|5|Very nice. Just what I needed to put in my contacts every morning. Sturdy too.
B0079V6ZAC|4|It says curly but the pic and the wig have straight hair.  I love this wig!  It's the right length and texture and color.  Looks soo real!
B003XIXH38|4|I have sjogrens syndrome so my mouth is always dry. I am always drinking water and carry it everywhere I go. Sometimes this is not always convenient, especially when sleeping and this works pretty well for me. I sometimes have a hard time getting it so the subscription with Amazon works very good for me.
B001TSJ7ZQ|1|These are probably the worst bobby pins that I have ever bought. The price was so low that I was willing to give a try, thinking how bad can they be. Well, they are in every sense \\"bad\\". They are cheaply made, flimsy, after 10 minutes of being in your hair, they start to fall out on their own. Even sitting still for 10 minutes will not keep them in place. A product that will take up space in your drawer and will not get used.
B001V9LUR6|4|I LOVE this product! I recently reluctantly switched from stealing my mom's (this is actually Katy C. Ameglio's daughter) Facial Toner to this, because my skin is oily. I was reluctant to switch because the Facial Toner worked so well for me. But since I've been using it for the past two months, I have most definitely noticed a difference in my normal-to-oily skin after using this day and night. My skin is not only almost blemish-free, but it's so so soft too! And I have to give all the credit to this wonderful product, because it's the only thing in my routine that I've changed. It's not too drying when I use it at night without a moisturizer (like Dr. Hauschka recommends). The one complaint I have is the smell of the product. It's not as pleasant as the Facial Toner. This may be a matter of personal preference. I got used to it after a couple of days, but again I really liked the smell of the Facial Toner better. But hey, what's a little smell when it comes with such glorious results? :) I'm here today to buy my second bottle. I would recommend this to anyone with normal-to-oily, oily or very oily skin.    -Daughter of Katy C. Ameglio
B00STT4BH2|5|stays on. Does not settle into lines, perfect color
B003JVWQY0|5|This perfume is a fresh clean scent that stays on for 24 hrs. I could still smell it after I woke up in the morning
B008CC3NHK|5|This deodorant works. It's cheap and does the job. It smells decent too. I don't like spending a lot on popular brands like Axe, so this is great if you can get it for around $2.00 per stick.
B00LMOT2OI|5|I used this Argan Oil on my hair after warming it and left on overnight covered with a plastic cap.  After washing and conditioning, my hair felt like pure silk.  Very good oil treatment for your hair!
B0040VIRGO|5|I had already used this blush before buying it at Amazon.  It's different in that it looks gray when it comes out of the tube and then turns a beautiful rose after you apply to the cheeks.  You only need the slightest little bit.  My first tube has lasted almost a year & I've used most every day.
B007GBNRY2|5|Wonderful. I bought this many months ago and it still works fabulously :)
B004SXTF38|5|At first I thought the color was going to be too neon bright, but when I put it on the color was just right. A beautiful pink that really looks fantastic on the hand.
B006ZR8VTO|5|I order this for my husband via Amazon Subscription. He seems to use it every time he has 2 or more in the cabinet (probably to make space, but whatever works, right?). It subtly covers most of the grey (not all) and looks natural. He can do it himself, but I find that he misses places and dyes the tips of his ears. I prefer to do it for him if I see the box out on the counter. It takes me about 4 minutes to apply.
B001VYRONU|5|You can't get a better pair of scissors for the money.  Extremely sharp and good looking.
B004NX17J8|5|great  for  my  hair  love  it
B001ET76AI|5|This product has saved my professional life. My meetings, one-on-one's were uncomortable for years, starting chewing gum but that didnt look professional.
B009ZQTDTY|1|I got this in an acrylic kit. SO bad! no matter how hard and often I tried to clean the acrylic off of the brush it wouldn't come off. Also the bristles come out of the metal piece AND the metal piece cant off of the plastic utensil. I had to put some acrylic in the metal piece and jam the plastic bit in to try and re adhere the two together.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY.
B00JTY6WQ4|5|Convenient needle size and easy to roll on both body and face.
B00B405D0W|5|excellent!!!
B000NLHXEC|5|I wanted to make sure that this work before posting a review. It does make you sweat if you do a wrap with it I also have the Ann Chery waist trimmer. it is a great combination but you must workout in order to get a good work out. but do keep in might this is more of a water weight and can be gained back easily. but is is by far a great product.
B00LLPPSGO|5|I'm a guy and don't use these for removing makeup. I originally bought a small 10 pack to bring with me camping. However, I liked them a lot they made my face feel clean and looked good. I was suprised. However, they were pretty expensive (10 for like $5), but if you buy this pack I found it to be both convenient and decently priced.<br /><br />The reason I like this one is because I can use the large packs at home and I can take a few of the individual packs if I go camping over a weekend, or bring the larger one if it'll be a longer trip or vacation.<br /><br />I don't use them much when I'm just at home, but sometimes do on occasion.<br />The price comes out to about $0.37 each which isnt bad if you aren't using like 2 a day or something.
B0081RZ2X4|5|Hair type: Dry, Wavy bob<br />Hair color: Dyed blonde, naturally medium brunette<br /><br />Uses:<br />-The day before I wash: I can go four days without washing if I use Batiste on day 3<br />-Saves me a wash: Many people consider it better for your hair to wash it less frequently. I honestly don't know if that's true, and I am just too lazy to dry my hair, which is necessary in the winter where I live. When I save myself the wash, I save my hair the heat of another blow dry, and I save myself the time of washing it.<br />-At work: I have one of these in my desk drawer and I sneak away to the bathroom to spray it if I am getting a little greasy. Don't spray this at your desk, it's &#34;pretty aromatic,&#34; as my boyfriend described.<br />-After a work out: I work out pretty frequently and try to maintain an infrequent hair washing schedule. When the sweat in my hair dries (ew,) I use this to restore life to my hairstyle.<br /><br />I do NOT use this product to cover my roots. It lightens them up a little bit, but if you use too much, it's very yellow, not natural at all.<br /><br />I just bought two more cans of this: one for home and one for my desk drawer at work. I can't recommend it highly enough!
B00LNOV8JO|5|I have been looking for an Organic Rosehip Oil to help keep my skin from becoming dry and am so glad I found this. Well worth the price, a little goes a long way!  The 4oz bottle will last a long time.  Definitely will repurchase!
B0096UGXKG|5|I bought this product for my girl friend a few weeks back... she loves it! Liked it so much she asked if I could get more for her. She says it helps her retain her color much, much longer than her old shampoo did. I guess she knows what she is talking about... from my side, all I can say is her hair looks simply amazing!
B001U9M2EW|5|Wow JUST Wow!,, Smell is very very good
B00065IBKK|2|I am not happy with this purchase. The price was right here, but I am disappointed with the performance. We had a Conair kit very similar to this before and it lasted for years, was quiet and only pulled at hair toward the end. This one is SO LOUD right out of the box, which I don't like, and worse is that it is already starting to pull at hair when we use it even though I have used the oil/lube included. The loudness might get better... but I'm not sure if the pulling will. I am already thinking about whether this was cheap enough to just throw out and buy another one.
B0006ZM4LM|2|I have used four Norelcos over many decades. Rather than buying new cutters for two year old shaver, time to try Braun. I have used new Series 3/340 for three weeks now. Smooth but NOT close; particularly on neck. Leaves too much stubble. I do not particularly like these little buzzing/vibrating razors but I suppose I would get used to that. Contrarily, Norelco feels like it has small balanced electric motor in comparison. To get a close shave I find I have to go back and RESHAVE with Norelco. Not good! Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun's. I have sixty days in which to return. I will put up with it for another week or so and then return it if shaves don't get anywhere as close as they did with all my previous Norelcos. Not a bad product. Just mediocre results, but that does not make a nice, clean shave. I am disappointed. Expected more. I do love the ability to rinse with water after shaving though.
B004ZHTM2G|5|All product was here. Sterilized.
B000YHWR0K|5|Great
B001FWXHAM|5|This was my first perfume, and one of my favourites. It is a great fragrance and very long lasting. Also great price compared to other fragrances.
B00R42M8OS|5|Let me start by saying I have color treated, naturally curly hair that tends to get get dry and frizzy very easily. I absolutely LOVE the Deep Conditioner by Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair, so I was super excited to see if my hair results after using the Advanced Hair Repair Shampoo and Conditioner could be even better. After using this terrific combo, WOW, even my husband noticed my hair felt silky to the touch and smelled so good! I will be an Arvazallia customer for life!
B000UWAWQU|5|Before purchasing this product I had read alot of negative reviews.  Not sure what their problem was. Since I bought the first one and tried it, I have since bought two more. It does exactly what it says it does. I have not had one instance of the attachment being loose or flying around as others complained about. It is easy to fill, easy to use and it holds a charge for a good week. My husband,my daughter, my father all find this product very useful in getting into places the floss couldn't get. Personally for my teeth, I still like floss and don't find it to be a replacement but an additional way to be sure my teeth are sqeaky clean. Would highly recommend.
B001E0R2YW|4|Loved it.
B002ZVBF1U|5|First use hair seem like it grow haha
B00DSOL6QW|2|As soon as I received the brush in the post, I washed it and it shed a bit, not a big deal, most brushes will shed a few hairs then stop so I wasn't bothered by it. The next day when I went to use it, I noticed the ferrule was loose, that disappointed me, The brush was not expensive, and I needed/wanted a big fluff brush. I will have to end up trying to glue the ferrule back to stop the jiggle.....On to my quest for a BIG fluffy brush that I will be happy with. 2 stars b/c it still has some potential, fairly decent brush hairs.
B0018V2URG|1|I'm hispanic but very fair-skinned. Bought both the Day and Night creams and endured applying them for about a week. Thick and greasy and very unpleasant on the underarms (where I have my skin discoloration). As I didn't use it for very long, I can't say whether using it longer would have yielded results, but as I recently found out about Hydroquinone (the active ingredient) and it's link to many health problems-including cancer-I'm not willing to take the risk, especially when the packaging says that it may take up to 3 months to notice a difference. That's 3 months too long of applying a toxic cream to my skin. Apparently the ingredient is banned in many countries around the world, but I don't know why the US is still using it..anyways, use at your own risk.
B001KNNCJW|1|Too watery for my thick short hair
B00S7DP2PU|5|Good sponge, and yes it does kinda fall apart but it's a sponge and I do realize it doesn't last forever. However, my son is still using his and it gets the job done.
B005HIH7YM|3|Very strong sweet smell. Product is very thick, and pump is kinda useless. If you have a big mop of thick curly hair like me, you'll just unscrew it and squeeze the bottle. The bottle is VERY small and it takes a lot of product, as your hair may soak it up if its coarse and dry-ish like mine. Its not bad to have for a trip, as the bottle is small and you don't need shampoo and conditioner. It seemed to clean my hair nicely and gave it plenty of slip to get the tangles out after I let it soak for a bit. Its not a bad product, but I feel like I can get a better deal with something else, as it takes so much for my hair. I wasn't a fan of the smell, as it lingered for a long time and was very sweet. Its kinda orange candy-ish. Its not bad, but I prefer more clean smells and don't like hair stuff that competes with my perfume. It was so strong that my husband even noticed and asked me if I had put something different in my hair. (I use different stuff all the time, as I am always on a quest to find the perfect regimen for my curly hair, and he never notices.)
B001CT053U|5|Smells good on my husband.. Nice and light! The scent lingers
B00AQKKOAU|2|I was a bit disappointed when i received these items, as they are very, very tiny.  I would approximate maybe about 3 full hand polishes for each bottle.  Other than that the quality is very good as always with OPI products, the texture of these in particular takes a little getting used to.  These mini polishes are very good to test out the colours that you wish to purchase later.
B00O7XJUGG|5|Great product. Came in great packaging and promptly. Will be perfect for my dance recital!
B00113FWRG|4|My clients have really enjoyed the Plantlife Aromatherapy Oils.  Especially the Sore Muscle as it does not smell like your typical analgesic.  I'm not a big fan of the Relax blend myself as the fragrance is a bit \\"sweet\\" for me, however, my clients love it.  I'm giving this 4 stars due to the lack of labeling.  For clients with allergies I must refrain from this brand as there is not a complete list of ingredients and I don't want to risk an allergic reaction.
B001DKIFSA|1|The vanish extreme under eye cream may work for others, but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me, I've suffered many years with dark circles and been trying to find a product that REALLY WORKS. Does anyone have any suggestions?
B0012JG00M|5|The blade is the perfect length and goes through my dogs thick coat easily. It makes grooming simple and fast.
B002CMLRY2|5|I have sensitive skin, and Aveda products are some of the only ones I've found that don't break me out. When I began coloring my hair, I asked my hairdresser to recommend a product that (a) would smooth and control the inevitable damage that coloring does and (b) not cause an allergic reaction.<br /><br />This was her recommendation. She was spot-on. It works very well to control damaged hair and does not cause any irritation. I also use [[ASIN:B002CMLRX8 Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]] and [[ASIN:B0016JFH3O AVEDA by Aveda: Damage Remedy Intensive Restructuring Treatment--/4.2OZ]], and my hair feels soft and looks shiny.<br /><br />It's expensive, yes. But to me it's worth it. Highly recommend!
B00K1JX44Y|3|The smell is OK...not offensive smell but not pleasant smell either.  Texture is good and it did moisturize my skin.  But the staying power or the effectiveness of it is not so good because I'd put it on my arms on the morning and I'd go only go out for 2 hours and my arms still got tan.
B000689NGI|5|Great hard wax. People commenting that it doesn't stick to strips I don't think know how to use hard wax correctly. It's not meant to be used with strips. Great wax for the price. Nice clean hair removal. Product smells good. Will definitely buy again. Wonderful customer service as well makes me a very happy customer across the board.
B007W18NXQ|5|big hit at work
B00IOW38HS|5|The walking stick is real fine an I have NASCAR drivers sign them when I go to the races.
B005G9LPA4|5|lasting color love it!
B00E68O4JU|5|Excelent!<br /><br />But PLEASE Read the instructions because if you using upside down you can lost your hair. I learned the lesson .
B0009MFUPO|4|They fit.  They worked.  That's always great.
B000F3XY00|5|It is a great product, doesn't react with my skin as many other conditioners do. I will reorder again. Makes my hair<br />soft and manageable without adding weight to it. Love the way it smells.
B005237OI6|3|Good thing I'm a hairstylist so. I could fix this crooked haircut. The cap is very small. Will not fit an average size head. Don't buy it unless you have a small head. I used it on a mannequin.
B00KHYH50W|5|Theyre exactly what i expected
B000WS3CN2|5|just what I was looking for
B00CD9XVPM|5|I'm allergic to most everything in Florida and use these masks to cut down on exposure.  They really work very well for me.
B006O8DKJK|5|I like it
B0006PT6TU|5|I love my Lip Fusion Advanced XL but this is the Runner UP. Its thick, IT WORKS and and it lasts.... My lips are all the more luscious when using the Advanced XL before bed and City Lips during the day with a splash of color....
B0026HQCO8|5|I have used this eye cream for many, many years & adore it.  The cushion is just right...not too silicone-y or greasy.  Great for under & over makeup, as well as at night.  My under eye area looks much younger than my age, and I attribute it to this product.  Others I have tried aren't even close in terms of moisture retention, smoothing age related issues, and makeup application!  I apply it about 3 times a day & couldn't do without.  (I live in a super dry climate.)
B007X5LTN2|4|Great value. Fantastic for exfoliating.
B008LDFU26|1|How can Nerium give a &#34;30 day money back guarantee&#34; when they actually mean 30 days from the date of purchase and NOT the date the customer receives the product to try? This is blatant dishonesty and a poor business practice. If Nerium truly stood behind their product, they wouldn't have to hide behind false claims. My attempt at contacting the company to resolve this issue has only provided further dissension when I explain my situation. This is unacceptable customer service and I would not/do not recommend this product or company to anyone.<br /><br />The product was ordered on February 4 and delivered March 1. Nerium claims that I had until March 5 (30 days) in order to try it AND submit my claim for a refund. That's (4) days to try the product compared to their &#34;30 day money back guarantee&#34;. Further, I have emails between myself and customer service showing that I had yet to receive the product by February 28th so the company didn't have to take my word for when I actually received the product. When I called customer service, they verified that they have those emails on file, so no problem there. I spoke to a nice gentleman (Dennis) who tried his best to get me my refund but then I asked to speak to a customer service manager (Victoria). She said the guarantee actually means &#34;30 days from when you order&#34;. How exactly is that a &#34;30 day money back guarantee&#34; when the customer doesn't have the product in-hand to try for 30 days? Anyone else see the problem here? When I explained to her that THAT needs to be on the website, she said &#34;it's in our policies and procedures which is in your back office&#34;. Anyone know how to get there? You have to SIGN UP and ORDER the product to get access into the back office!<br /><br />There are numerous issues with this type of business practice, none of which have been resolved with respect or understanding. If I had actually had the product for more than 4 days, even up to 30 days and had goneover the time limit for the money back guarantee, sure, by all means, hold up the policy. But, if your company actually says one thing that is understood by the general public to mean one thing and you actually mean something entirely different, that is FALSE ADVERTISING. Having exhausted my options to work this out with Nerium International and being met with a simple &#34;sorry, we will not issue a refund&#34;, I have filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau. I truly hope that this was an isolated incident and you don't treat all customers who wanted to take the company up on it's &#34;money back guarantee&#34; with the blatant disrespect I was shown.
B00QMP79QK|5|I love this product! You only need a small<br />Amount so the bottle lasts a long time! You get a tingly sensation when applied, which is nice. The smell is pleasant but not overpowering. The clay leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.
B005XIM2M8|5|I tried other brands and it's don't clean my face as well as this Dove for Men, love it, i'm lazy so body and face in one bar, got to love it.
B00MW81F98|1|The product isn't any good. It didn't remove the hair.
B00GJ7QDTA|5|Nice smell and works great. I use it for insect bites and pimples.
B004INUWX0|5|The Infinitipro styler has made my hair shiny and silky smooth!  It's extremely easy to use (I have normal hair). After washing my hair, I dry it to about 80% - don't use a brush, just my hand. Then I quickly run a brush through my hair to get remove any tangles. I then section off my hair and use the Infinitpro to dry and style. It took only a couple of tries to get the motion down....don't grab too much hair, and pull away from your head when you start to feel resistance.  Not sure how it works, but by the time I'm done (takes about 10 minutes and I have shoulder length hair) my hair is incredibly shiny and smooth....no frizz whatsoever, even after I walk outside.....and I live in Florida! I'd definitely recommend this product.
B000VOHCPQ|5|A friend of mine recommended this product he smelled in a shop in paris. I started laughing when i heard it was for women, i said; are you crazy!! so i went on youtube and started reading and watching some reviews about it of guys using this product. I decided to buy it and give it a try if i didn't like it i would give it to my girlfriend but i totally love it and so does she. it is a product that in my opinion totally fits either gender. it is light, smells good. sticks to your clothes, i got a lot of complements about it. its not girly at all and smells clean and fresh.
B0018MPSHY|5|I bought older version of this same model number. I had since 2004 and i finally laid it to rest a couple weeks ago, June 2012. Yeah, i barely maintined it and it lasted this long, whichs means if i did take care of it, it would last longer. The best thing about this trimmer is that it is a trimmer, in fact a detail trimmer. It has trimmer blade on one side less than two inches wide and flip the head around and now you have a detail trimmer, less than half an inch wide. This version, comes with what i got before except in addition 3 extra detail guides with the adapter that goes over the head of the blades and adjust cut lenght acording to how much you want off. With that said, this version is better than one i got. Battery life is longer, unfortunately the plug use is to only charge the trimmer. In other words, if the battery is dying or dead, you cannot plut it into the wall and use it; it has to charge up to be used. This product feels sturdy in your hand when using, not that is feels poorly made or fragile or thin in the casing.<br /><br />***FYI***<br />This is a review, PEOPLE please learn and evolve from this. Stating that the product works, is not a review. Stating about the product that the ad lacks in details, such as the actual use, you people lack that in evert aspect. I have boughten things in the past that sucked due to the lack of information on the reviews.
B0009MJE74|5|Words can't describe how good this stuff is!  I use the all natural raw black soap regularly but I will always keep a bottle of this handy because it makes my skin softer than anything else has in the last ten years!
B0000AFUTL|5|This mirror is great, and I have it on the wall next to my vanity.  The lights over the vanity give it the perfect amount of light.  It's so nice to be able to pluck my eyebrows without getting out my glasses!!  The mirror looks great, and now I do too!
B000WYJTZG|2|not as good as model # 1570
B00FRDPNA2|5|My hair is colored/bleached and thin and lifeless.  The conditioner I had been using did not do anything for me.  My hair was just dry and lank as always.  However, using the Fekkai Color Care Conditioner I have noticed an improvement in the softness and volume of my hair.  My hair seems thicker and more lifelike.  And softer too.  The product smells nice and it washes out easily and cleanly.  I like it and will try to continue using this product.  I recommend for all with colored hair.
B000MMYI8G|5|Arrived quickly. Excellent product
B002HRENPW|5|This is THE BEST mirror I have ever found.  The one side is so magnifying.... sometimes I see TOO MUCH!!!  It looks nice on the vanity and stands well.  folds for storage or travel.
B003CU39VM|5|This oil lasted nine months. Kept my hair very moisturized and stimulated my hair growth, when used on its own.  I have mixed the oil with other oils that I have used and it provided my hair great definition when I created twists out on my hair.
B009MY12A2|5|Doesn't flake off, dries smooth and looks great! Comes in a wide range of colors.  Oh and it lasts for weeks!
B00GRUM71M|5|Beautiful!!! Love them! They're so vibrant and colorful!
B0052GJ0I0|4|Familiar with product ...not sure I particularly like the strawberry and mocha flavors ... but product arrived in a timely manner ... great presentation ... next time I may just order the original
B00A2XVSDS|3|I like the color but the nailpolish only lasts a day and then starts chipping. Opi is a much better brand.
B001VEK1HQ|2|My Series7 Braun shaver is barely 14 months old and I just ordered my third 70S replacement cartridge. All told, my original head lasted about 7 months and each of my two replacements has lasted about three. Fortunately, both replacements were courtesy of Braun after I complained about the limited life. But now I'm on my own and although I love my shaver, I'm definitely not happy about the short life span I'm getting from this replacement unit in terms of acceptably close shaves. I have had no issues with the foil.<br />Why is it that the replacement blades last half as long as the original? Because I don't believe they are the same unit even though they are physically indistinguishable from each other and Braun states they're the same. The proof is in the performance.<br />The fact is Braun, like its sister Gillette (both owned by P&G), is in the business of selling razor blades including for electrics. And razor blades are made to last only a certain time. Unfortunately, I have no choice but to use this unit if I want to keep using my Series7 shaver so I'll just have to suck it up.<br />I suspect that a lot of the favorable reviews you see here were written prematurely by people who only used their new 70S replacements a few times before writing in. Of course, I may be wrong and my experience may differ from most others. I'd like to hear some comments about longevity from other users. And oh, did I mention I only shave every other day?<br /><br />Update April 20,2013:<br />My shaver is now just shy of two years old and I am on my 5th 70S replacement cartridge. The fourth wasn't too bad out of the box but this current one was just bad from the get-go. If this is a quality control issue, it sure hasn't been resolved in my experience. I've changed my rating on this product to two stars from three because I truly don't like it. I probably should also have changed the title from \\"Good at First...\\" because this new one is not the first one that was lousy from the start.<br />All of this has caused me to move to another brand of shaver, which I alternate with the Braun to extend the lifetime of the blades, all the while hoping my next shave with it will be better than the last because I really do love everything else about the Braun.<br />All of this has caused me to move to another brand of shaver, which I alternate with the Braun to extend the lifetime of the blades, all the while hoping my next shave with it will be better than the last because I really do love everything else about the Braun.
B00I4ZS8FC|5|So I've had this item for a couple of weeks now and I really love it!  It helps make my vanity table look organized!  The item is pretty heavy duty.  I have my hairdryer and my flat iron in it and there are no problems.  I really can't say anything about the curling iron spots since I don't have any curling irons to put in there.  I have a larger flat iron, so my flat iron uses both slots for the flat iron.  I have not had any issues with any melting.  My flat iron has sit in the holder while on at a temperature of 400 degrees and there hasn't been any melting.  I'm very glad that I spent a few extra dollars to get the one with the plugs on the front, that allows me to have extra reach with my hair dryer and flat iron when using them.
B0047TO1G4|1|I should have known better, after readign the other reviews! Packaging very good, however items were still broken. I think it may just be really inexpensive product? Very dissapointing, as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift!
B00IA8JA1O|5|Amazing product.
B000NG80KS|3|I, seriously, thought that it was more than one bottle of  polish for $19.00. I could not believe it when it was delivered.  Actuallly, the product, itself, was exactly what I wanted -- the price was exhorbitant!
B00HK1GIF8|1|Did not fit phone, the plastic Window does not allow you to press keys
B00CFAY9U0|5|It's great!
B00B2G03K8|5|I've had some flare ups on the T-zone of my face for quite some time. I applied this product to the area at night and I noticed a significant difference in the size of the pimples the next morning. By day three, the pimples were completely gone. This acne treatment is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I don't feel any weird tingling or burning sensation. I would recommend this to anyone. For those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser along with this product. They work wonderfully together. And If you have dry skin as well, I would recommend Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid.
B000Z948I6|5|It has a wonderful mellow flavor all the way through to last (after) taste. Because it's organic, it has a fullness of flavor I can count on and I seem to never get tired of it. Its one of my favorites.
B003EUP3O6|5|This is an amazing product! The scent is yummy, my hair is soft and shiny!!! I will only use this from now on
B008OOYXMK|5|Gets my hair silky straight with minimal passes. The short teeth on the back of comb works well on edges amd roots.
B001VTRGGK|5|I purchased a sample pack of razors and found these to be my favorite. They are super sharp but they also have what I can only describe as a more 'positive feedback' quality to them. I can feel the blade when I am shaving, which not everyone likes but I am a fan of.<br /><br />The pack size is a spectacular deal. This is clearly a wholesale package meant for the individual boxes of razors to be sold at a storefront. I shave about three times a week, Monday's shave being the first and thickest with a full weekend buildup behind it. I switch razors every other shave or so but a single blade could easily last the week. It is going on eight months since I purchased these and I've still got a ton to spare.<br /><br />This is where the value lives in the safety razor vs. cartridges argument. The only potential drawback is that I might want to try out some different razors now that I have my technique down and it will probably be another eight months before I am out of these.
B00LYXD0TA|5|I have been using this product for a while now. The polish really stays on for two weeks only nail growth shows but I fix that with filing. I have one tip that I use that I feel helps the polish last for 2 weeks that is I soak my bare nails in white vinegar for. 15 minutes before I put polish on and it removes any oils on nails. I put 2 to 3 coats of color on ( depending how I want coverage  ). I wait a few minutes between coats and add.  1 coat top polish and let it dry for 15 minutes then it's really dry to the touch.  So far I have seen no damage to my nails .  And they are as hard as gel polish.
B005V9FY6U|5|I love this scent.  So glad I could buy it through you. Will re order when I run out again.
B00QMWXPUC|5|Great products, surprised I enjoyed the smell of all of them (not usually a lavender fan).  Definitely a different feel from my typical soap, in a good way.
B000JWQ3LE|1|I have ordered this product several times before, and like it. However, this time, it came in different packaging; and as soon as I opened it, I got a plastic/metallic smell - not good. I thought maybe it was just off-gassing from the seal, but it actually permeated the entire contents, so that they tasted of plastic and/or metal. It was inedible, and I am concerned about this product's safety.
B00317FUP4|5|This one of those products that just works! It is easy to use and cut very well.Buy it with confidence.
B005F1ISR6|5|I've used Nioxin for years as my hair often falls out when I get stressed.  My dad even used it when he had chemo and didn't lose his hair.  I have recommended it to a friend recently as she's going through chemo now.  Her hair has got thinner but she hasn't lost it and had really harsh treatment.  I tend to only use it once a week but those on chemo should really use it every time.
B00G8QZMH6|1|I used to LOVE the old formula of Queen Helene Masque; it was very nice on my sensitive skin and made me feel very fresh after using.<br /><br />This product is completely different, although they put pictures of the old formula on their listings (conveniently I might add). This new formula is more acidic and harsher on my skin. I'll be switching to a more high quality product.
B000Q6T6F8|5|Exactly as described, fits perfectly.  Like buying a new razor for one-third of the cost.
B000C1W49M|4|My son love this and I must admit it does smell terrific!  Nicely priced too.
B007K6K0IY|4|Ok so when it comes to deodorant, I prefer the tried and true.  No one wants to be out with a sub par deodorant because they decided to try something new, but hey when you get to test a product for free, why not.  Especially if I can do so for the first time from the comfort of my home.<br /><br />This product had a lot to prove to me and that it did.  I have never been a fan of gels, mostly because putting them on made my underarms feel like a puddle.  With Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, this was not the case.  It was fast drying and lived up to its no white marks and wetness protection.  I love it.  The claim that it is 2 day protection is one that seems to live up as well.  I never went a full two days without reapplying because of my own hesitations, but definitely lasted me longer than 24 hours.<br /><br />The only thing I was not a fan of was that I seem to go through the gel quicker than my own regular solid deodorant.  Of course, if I were to only use it every 2 days, that might not be the case.  Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this product a try!<br /><br />I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.
B002LV317A|5|I love how my natural hair changes into soft ringlets of curls when I use this.  My hair melts and is so manageable.  This is so natural, i used it as a hair dress, and a leave-in.  It's better than all the expensive brands and is only 2.99 in the actual trader joe's store!  My hair texture (4a curls) has changed dramatically since I started using this.  It's even grown a lot as well.  I try everything and the trader joe's nourish spa line is what i have settled on for shampoo and conditioner.  I don't let anything else touch my hair ever. It's hard to find a person that would disagree.  I did research and read reviews before buying it and people lost their marbles talking about how it hasn't failed them.  Best thing that happened to my afro ever!<br /><br />Update, It's now 4/16/2012--and I still ONLY use this product.  There isn't a thing I would change about my review.  What I would change about my natural-hair experience is having turned to this product earlier.  It really is amazing and I've been faithful to this product for years.
B0002JKPB8|5|I have no words. These are truly a must have. I like to do a lot of the vintage pin up hair and these give you that look in literally minutes. They are super easy to use, they heat up in just 5 seconds, and they come with a large variety of sizes. The best I've ever used. No complaints what-so-ever.
B010GKUBE8|4|Great product. Feels good in your hands/comfortable
B00163UR5I|5|I like this color because it matches most of the clothes that I wear.  I'm mature (old) and don't want to make my hands a focal point.  This color does the trick for me - the well groomed look without the &#34;pop&#34; of a youthful jolt...
B003WXW61S|1|did not smell as expected
B007VX0O4Q|5|I don't know much about this product.  All I know is that my wife loves it and I like the smell of it.  She could probably tell you more about it, then I can.  But, I know that it is the only perfume that she wears.
B004BVDXW6|5|This Lotion For Tanning in the UV Beds is So Moisturizing and Smooth,  actually Hydrates Your Skin! I Totally Love It! Swedish Beauty Has Great Products..
B007RO813U|1|thought it would be a whole lot better... however the back piece keeps on breaking.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product.
B002YGR164|5|love this new PINK line!!
B00QL1ZJK8|5|Another great he cream for so many uses and leaves your skin feeling soft and moist all day but never greasy !!!
B002S8Z660|5|Great product! Just wish it had a a larger spindle-type brush.
B000P20R8I|5|Excellent..!
B004XDEAK6|5|I love this product. It is very easy to use. Having carpal tunnel syndrome, it does not hurt my hands. I absolutely love this product and the money spent was well worth it. Also, if you are having issues using it got to youtube and search for the Helix channel.  It is very helpful.
B00LVPDBA4|5|I purchased this item just after Christmas. It came with a $10 coupon from Philips Sonicare. I checked around different sites like Target but the price was always higher due to mailing costs at the other sites and they didn't include the extra head and the travel case. I couldn't chose the color and the brush will have to tossed when the battery dies, but it was a great purchase for the price.<br /><br />For years I had been told at my dental checkups to get away from the cheap manual brushes and buy one of these. I used my brother's old Braun for a while before I ran out of brush heads. But I had read this product was superior and I decided I didn't want to go to the dentist for cleanings every three months. I had been unemployed and dental insurance was not a priority. But after not going to the dentist for two years, my gums were in trouble and I was told I needed cleanings every three months as well as using prescription mouthwash every night.<br /><br />I just had my first cleaning since November of last year and I was told I don't have to come back for six months!! I have been using this brush once a day, just before bed, ever since it arrived in early January. In less than 2 months time, it has helped get rid of plaque and improve my gums and almost completely eliminate any gum bleeding. Even better, it has a much better reach than my manual toothbrush. I have a small mouth and it is very hard to reach the back teeth on both sides.<br /><br />Some of the more expensive models look great but most people don't need all the extras. This has a 2 minute timer and the charger flashes when it is charging. I like the plastic cover you can put back on the toothbrush when you return it to the charger. I would have liked the UV cleaning systems but at least the brush head is covered. When the battery goes, I will certainly buy this model again if it is still available.
B000FS05VG|5|Awesome blow dryer.  I use it on my beard and the adjustable heat is great.  No more baking your hair, just use the lower heat setting, and the directional tip is great.
B000YKHGJ4|5|the item came well packaged and is in fact a cousin to the pino slyvestre scent. It isnt strong but does last long and is pleasent. I am quite pleased.
B00LPBQPKW|1|it was terrible. threw it in the garbage. the return postage was 14.00 dollars because it was going to china!! I was under the impression it came from a popular wig site in the united states. oh well...live and learn. it was sooo cheaply made.
B0041TEY0S|5|This works great!  I use 40 developer and it turned my hair a beautiful copper color (I only use for a few highlights, not all over color) on my dark brown hair.  You might have to highlight again until you reached the desired color, depending on how your hair reacts/virgin hair/colored hair.  As for the color lasting, well like with other &#34;red&#34; tones, red tends to not last that long.  It didn't damage my hair, even after redoing it the next day until I reached the color I wanted.
B000KPKBOA|4|Just what I needed, but couldn't find locally.  Amazon came though again with the right product at the right price.
B001ECQSRC|3|the item itself is made really well. but it is a tight fix for my husbands dentures.
B0000YUXI0|5|My son has sucked his thumb from the time he was eight weeks old.  He is now three.  We tried just encouraging him to stop and using the Fireman Fred booklet and puppet.  Both didn't work.  I put a band-aid on his thumb every day and that helped but he still couldn't break the habit.  Then over Christmas break, I put the Mavala stop on and he IMMEDIATELY stopped thumb-sucking and hasn't done it since.  I did one follow-up brushing on the nail and the cuticle line -just to be absolutely sure- and that was it.<br /><br />He found the taste HORRIBLE.  Keep in mind that when eating the thumb may come into contact with the mouth and be a yucky experience during mealtimes.  Just have a drink ready and the bad taste will eventually dissipate.<br /><br />This is a wonderful product!  It worked for us.  I will be using it on my younger son when he is old enough per the package directions.<br /><br />Some tips:  Use the mavala stop when you have nothing going on and can deal with your child's irritability during the day, and some restless sleep -or even crying at night.  A few days to a week and things should be much better at night.  Also keep in mind that the thumb is a soother, so it may take awhile for your child to emotionally adjust.<br />UPDATE:<br />As I stated above,  I would be trying it on my second son.  He was an ambidextrous thumb sucker.  I decided not to wait until three and used it a few months before then - trying to avoid those preschool germs.  I only had to apply it once!  He never put his thumbs in his mouth again.  No reapplication was necessary.  Awesome product period!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
B005SJSQIG|5|The mask is good to use and won't cause you to be allergic or uncomfortable. Also it can brighten my skin.
B00371PJ1E|5|This is a great product if you are dealing with things like an itchy rash as well as acne. There are other products that say they contain sulfur in them and I have tried them. They must not have the same amount in them because they don't work as well as this does. Doesn't smell all that nice but it's not terrible either. It does what it says it will. Good product.
B0009OAHIW|5|I get compliments on this scent everywhere I go both from males and females. It's really a perfect everyday perfume that's not heavy nor lingers.
B00I84FLSG|1|It didn't live up to it's description
9790790961|5|This was an awesome deal. One of my wife's favorite perfumes and I paid about half of what it would cost in a department store.
B001KYRQ7A|5|Everyone was perfect.
B0096AI5HA|1|Does not work and neither of the covers over the batteries will stay shut....absolutely useless. Don't waste your money on this!
B000P22TIY|5|My favorite cologne. This smell is pure bliss mixed with sexual delights!
B0015NZ6FK|5|Before I purchased this mask I browsed and browsed various sites to find the mask that suit my needs and looks good. At first glance this mask didn't really stand out until I read the reviews. For the most part I've read a ton of positive reviews and a few unhappy reviews as well. I decided to buy the mask and I must say I really enjoy it.<br /><br />I have a round face so not all masks fit me well but this mask is so soft that it kind of hugs my face. It blocks out the light almost completely. It also looks really good and blue is my favorite color so that's awesome :)<br /><br />I do have a few gripes about it and that is in the summer the thickness can be a bit much if you happen to sleep during the day like I do. If the temperature gets above 60 degrees then there might be a little sweating involved once you put this mask on. It's not much, but it is enough to make me rub my eyes in my sleep a few times.<br /><br />Aside from that one negative I have nothing but positive things to say about this mask. It's great for the price, looks great, feels great and most importantly, covers your eyes completely and blocks almost ALL light.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this to anyone.
B0092SVTGA|4|Service was excellent. Arrived on time and in good packaging. The material is slightly stiffer  than the real sponge but it works just as well. Colors are very pretty. Can't beat the price either. Would recommend and buy again.
B006T4L0GO|5|Working good for anything of painful coughs, headaches, out of joint...!
B00G3JUJLM|5|These are so easy to use!  Stick to teeth, taste great!  And it works!
B00DPE9EQO|5|I'm 55 years old and have never looked my age until recently. I don't have a lot of fine lines or wrinkles but my neck and jowls have begun to sag and it is to the point that I actually told my husband last week that I was going to look into a lifestyle lift. I saw this product and read the reviews and thought I would give it a chance first. I started using this product in combination with retin a 5 days ago. Today I looked in the mirror and saw immediately that my sagging neck was a lot less noticeable. I thought it was probably the lighting but nope. There is already a smoothness to my skin that was not there last week. I'm extremely hopeful and can't wait to see the 30 day results!!
B002B8VE4U|5|The best part about this hair dryer is you don't need a converter for International use. It's built in. All you need are the adaptor plugs.
B00IGPP3US|5|Cheap, works and very small. A little light weight for home use but perfect for taking on the road.
B00016KM8S|5|Arrived promptly. A very nice gentle brush for long fine  hair. Does not break hair or damage scaip. It's well made and cleans easily. I recommend this product.
B00NFVI45E|5|The best hair creme ever.
B002WQ8XNG|5|great price and gets hot quick.
B003WR3QSG|4|Great for the price sheds every now and again. Started out kinda of stiff but, over time has become nice and soft. Happy with purchase. Great buy for beginners.
B00GT2S8MK|5|very handy
B00JITDVD2|5|Hubby was very pleased with the way it cleaned his beard.
B000V0YL4U|5|I was a bit sceptical at first, as there are so many new fancy brands on the market with 8 peptides per cream, all new branded ingredients and myths around them, bla bla bla. I decided to give it a go after reading all great reviews here. I was looking for a new skincare line as high-end brands are just rediculuosly overpriced for what they offer.    Result- Swisa really improved my skin when I had a serious clogged pores situation (fulliculitis).    No idea whether it is dead sea salts or selection of ingredients in general, but my skin looks better than ever, firm, reduced wrinkles, younger by a decade (I am 35), zero spots.    I use it in combination with the Prototype - 37c and UNT AHA/ABA serum.    It is sold at discount on Amazon, and A-VIVA seller fills in details in the product description form in a client-oriented manner so you do not have to pay import tax. Fantastic deal all in all.    I would recommend this brand to anyone.
B004SIIHXM|5|I love it but the pump would not work!
B00J5M7FC0|5|This is one of the best Sugar Scrub I have used. Its more expensive than whats available, but I can assure you it works wonder on my skin!
B008A376KG|1|The hook was extremely poorly made both broke on the first time I used it. I wouldn't recommend.  I am sorry I brought them.
B0009EXOO6|3|I think this product smells horrible. My boyfriend says he likes the smell, but I disagree. Maybe I'm just used to very citrusy and nice smelling products when this is more of a natural scent.<br /><br />I decided to get this product because I've been using oils on my hair and wanted to switch it up. I'm having the hardest time finding a leave in that I like. All of them seem to leave my hair tangled and stuck together. This isn't the worst, but I will not be repurchasing. (I have pretty fine hair with dry ends)
B000VRRE2O|5|They work wonders on your hair.i love the look after curling my hair with these. Definitely recommend to buy these.
B001185HC6|5|[[ASIN:B001185HC6 NEW - MY MANICURIST PRO Powerful Nail Drill w/ Bits Acrylics Gels]]<br />The ordering process & the product received were exactly as I had hoped.  Thank you very much for making such an item avaiable to an at home, do-it-yourself only on myself manicurist!
B00I0X15WQ|5|Best price and quality
B0032DJWZG|5|favorite
B0039BGHYK|3|I've been looking for a top coat that will last at least 7 days -- and this is not it.  This isn't even a top coat that lasts 5 days, sadly. After 2 full days, there is some light 'only-I-notice-it' chipping, and by the 4th day, forget about it, just repaint your nails.  It's nice and shiny for 1st day.<br />Gave it 3 stars, because I've had worse, but I've also had much better  (Revlon Colorstay, i'm talking to you!).
B00OQUP9GU|5|I use this product on my body and hair and I love the way it absorbs in my skin and scalp. It makes my skin so silky and smooth. I especially love it cause it's all natural. It gets a thumbs up from me!
B001HLCFQI|5|This really works!!! Bye bye bad breath. I brought this for my mom, and I can testify that it works.
B001RYNN2K|5|Just how I remember it when I was a kid
B005EPR7NY|5|Fresh scent. Love it
B00T5VO8DK|5|I really like this; ordered 3 to give as door prices for games in a bridal shower. They come singles. I would like to order another pair for me, but I think these are for feet with 5-6 size shoes. I wear a 7 or a 7 1/2; seems small for me. It barely fits if I stretch it. Then when you stretch it, there are some bald spots on the string. I was afraid to walk with them on. Anyway they are nicely made, sturdy and above all the strings arrived intact. I still give it 5 stars because I will be proud to give these as gifts and they arrived so quickly. Too bad can't have one for me.
B00O14R17Q|3|I have used about half the jar and I haven't noticed a significant reduction in my stretch marks. However, it is very moisturizing and it may do well at preventing stretch marks.
B0019CGUFC|5|My wife like it a lot.
B005CHHO46|4|It is working well so far. I am on my 2nd time using it and I can see my hair growing slow and missing on some parts.<br />But I am waiting for more resuts.<br />I am trying to control how many flashes I am using, after that I saw some people saying that it doesn't have 1.500 as it says. Everything is working well so far.
B00B5FNYQG|4|I was very Happy With this lotion and plan on buying more of it once I begin to run low.
B00E26C8DA|5|Tames the frizz to give you nice defined curls.
B00LTEBEYC|4|I'll admit when I first purchased one of these I really didn't see what all the fuss was about, but at the time I was only using it once in awhile, once I started using this after the gym everyday I really started to see a difference and my complexion looked better and better. I was previously using these alone but recently started adding a pump of Cerave cleanser and both of those together really leave you with soft clear skin.
B00L5BXG36|2|This mask became uncomfortable really fast. Hurt my ears having it on and it would just fold up at times while i was wearing it. Wouldn't recommend it.
B004DB9KPS|5|This was purchase as a gift for my husband.  I hoped he at least like it. surprise to me he does. He likes it and wishes he had another set.
B00127S53E|5|Great body wash for men. I just bought this body wash on the Prime's Day to replace my Dove's Men body wash. It was in a pack of 3 so it was a gamble considering the fact that I never tried Nivea before, but I won big this time. I actually like this more than any other brands that I have tried: The smell is very good, not as overbearing as Old Spice, still very masculine and refreshing. Comparing this product to Dove, even though I like them both, this product works up a better lather than the Dove does so I can use less. I would switch to Nivea indefinitely, highly recommend.
B000PY7JH8|5|I bought this blind, and I'm happy with this purchase, I feel like I dodged a bullet with this item... And will never buy blind again. I know that sounds strange- but this edt epitomizes the complexity of fragrance. It reminded me how much of our enjoyment of scents is dependent on chemistry. When I first sprayed it on, I became terrified. It smelled a bit like fresh kitty litter. I thought I messed up. Big time. But after about 5 minutes I caught a whif of something subtly musky and a little spicy... It smelled divine, and that smell was me. I asked my partner to sniff me... He is not fond of my perfume obsession (to put it gently), but he liked the scent. He kept saying it reminded him of something pleasant but he didn't know what. To me it smells like my mother's kitchen when I was living with her during college after she left for work- her perfume still in the room but faded and blending with the old wood and spice smell of the house. But it's a very complex scent and I reccomend getting a decant to try out for a few days before committing to a bottle. But if you know and love jicky- this seller did a fine job.
B005F1ITI4|3|I've only had the system for a few weeks and so far I can't tell a difference. But at it we shall keep, hopefully with lea jumpers along the way.
B000EPA4FW|5|so far, no pimples.  Yeah!
B004KA36BG|4|Bought this stuff at the Dollar Tree, on a whim. So far so good.
B007CY0EHG|4|its a nice pen<br />i like it for eye liner also
B00306CISI|4|This hand cream is really nice and does moisturize well and does make my cuticles look nice and also helps with the stretching that usually comes in a dry office environment.  I use it at work and have to be careful because it is quite greasy and is no good for getting on your keyboard
B001U0ONQG|1|this is not the one i thought it was with the foam that was the one i wanted. after reading the description i thought that was what i was going to get for a great price. i am using it but it is nasty
B000FEGUIM|5|This is my second or third one of these over the past 10-12 years or so.  I use one every day and it performs well, holds a charge for a couple of weeks, so overall I am very satisfied.  It doesn't shave QUITE as close as a blade, but who cares?  As a trade off for never cutting myself, it's worth it.    The only reason I bought a new one was that the old one needed a new blade set which was about $30.  I was able to get a whole new razor for $38, so I bought it.  Gave the old one away... it was still running pretty well.
B00F9X34XS|1|Didnt Meet my expoectation, The packing , delivery were all excellent , unfortunately this Electronic brush was not the best i would recommend to anyone.
B008S3AXSK|3|I've heard about Tom Ford through friends some good some bad.  I'm glad I decided to buy a sample size first
B002VATZDU|4|I love this lotion and I love how it makes my baby's skin feel. But I don't love the price so I had to stop buying it.
B00O2CPVII|1|The size is not worth the price. You can find it cheaper in the stores!!
B001B0ZBCA|5|best for ingrown neck hair for men
B007RI1BUQ|5|Love it!
B00A6H2DD4|5|Did it's job. Soaked face first in hot water than did my face. Got out all gunk in my pores without pain ! Well worth the purchase !
B0046D754G|5|Smells amazing and my hair is super soft and so shiny.  I have fine hair and didn't have any issues with any sort of heaviness or greasy feel.
B00445MH4E|5|You can never have enough chapstick, and it's hard to find the cherry flavor Vaseline lip therapy (usually can only find the original), so this is a fantastic purchase if you are addicted to chapstick like me.
B0056PDLUU|5|You will not find a better or stronger Beetroot Extract than this, so give it a try for yourself, it is the best I've found anywhere on Amazon and the Internet.
B0089PZZKS|5|I don't usually write reviews for stuff, but I felt like I had to for this product because it actually works! I've been using Kojie San for almost a month now--I'll admit I don't do the two times a day that lots of people recommend on here, but even so, my skin has really benefited from it. I'm already naturally pale, with yellow undertones. I bought this soap because first of all, I love its short and sweet ingredient list and my face was looking pretty dull and I had developed these little, stubborn bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried. At first I thought it was my mineral makeup oxidating, so no joke, throughout the day, I would constantly touch up my powder to &#34;re-brighten&#34; my face. After washing my makeup off, I noticed my skin would still look dark... Now my face is the same color as my body. It's bright and smooth--the bumps on my forehead are gone and I don't really use much makeup on my face anymore, except for my undereye circles. As for my bacne, again, I haven't used this soap as often as I probably should and maybe exfoliating would help too, so I still have scars, BUT no new breakouts at least.<br /><br />So this soap does not turn you ghost white, if that's what you're going for, it just reveals your natural skin tone and brightens it. I have very sensitive skin, so I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes before it starts burning. I do 20 on my body, but I'm considering trying 30. I moisturize with jojoba oil afterward and I haven't had a problem with the soap being too drying or causing wrinkles. I'm very happy with this product and I wholeheartedly recommend it :)
B000CPIMNA|4|I have been using this as my conditioner for a few months now. What I have found is that it works best if you use it to towel dry hair and keep it in for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it. Additional heat treatment, like a straighter really helps bring out the shine in the hair. So far I love this, but i wish there was something that worked quicker (and not be $$$) as I don't have the time or patience to sit in shower for 10 minutes every time!! But i guess you have to try it to see how it works for your hair.
B000C1Z9ZS|5|I have tried many Oscar de la Renta products, but not the dusting powder.  It has a lovely fragrance and is easy to apply.
B00QL89MRW|3|thank you
B00BPPPNJM|1|Product was definitely watered down.
B007OWPWG4|5|I love this! Would totally recommend this!!!!  My youngest daughter & I have long hair, live in a hard water state. This gets the knots out pain free! Amazing! I straightened my hair for the first times in months!
B00CHHJJHY|5|Works well and smells amazing.
B003N4ST94|5|Awesome mascara. Took me forever to find a good organic mascara but this is it. It's NOT waterproof by any means. I'm a cryer so I've had my fair share of having to wipe this runny mascara away because of my tears but the plus side is it makes it easy to wash wash it off at the end of the day. It makes me feel good to be able to wear it without worrying what scary chemicals are hurting my eyeballs. All in all a great find!
B003N4MIAA|4|The only issue is that it's hard to apply. My fingers get tired of having to push the nob multiple times. But that's just the beginning because the more you use it the more it gets stuck and you have to pull it out after each spray. I'm gonna try a different bottle as the product itself isn't bad at all. Smells like coconut and my toddle has never gotten burned (live in AZ).<br /><br />Oh, and it's actually sprayable (when the spray works). I mean I bought some sunscreens in spray bottles that are useless as you still have rub the sprayed out drops over your body with you hands as they were more of a thick lotion consistency.
B008DK990Q|4|My daughter loved this tiara - we got it for a cruise for a princess dress-up while we were there.  I borrowed it a couple times too, every woman can be a princess!
B004M8BTQU|5|Great service, Great service Amozon is the best by far. I will definitely will continue to shop on this website. They do what they say.
B00ARWNVG6|5|The hair piece looks very unique and elegant in the hair. Very different from other combs. Only thing is, it's a little heavy.
B00427WJVK|3|it wasn't that pink as it should. I will check if the smell is still the same...not that satisfied at all
B000P9DS4Q|4|I like it that is easy to make my hair very soft and shiny.
B00K4EQHGI|5|Good product, kids liked it
B004RK7I2W|3|This stuff is... very weirdly oily? It does increase the volume in my lashes but I didn't expect such an oily formula; I don't reach for it as often anymore.
B004FL07LC|5|I love this product. It' not harsh. I noticed that I'm not getting as much acne as before i started using it.
B00G99SQES|5|Great trimmer.  It's nice that you can disinfect it by boiling it in the water or soaking in a disinfectant solution.
B000C1W550|5|I like it . My wife likes it. What else matters?
B0094DH1RE|2|I received the wrong lashes. They were very short and way shorter than my real lashes. No way was I gonna ship it back to China so I ended up giving them to my daughter to play with on her dolls.
B0046MLZWU|5|Great product
B006WHXI6S|4|Good tool.
B00FQQYJKK|5|bought for parents who suffer from arthritic hands and they both gave 5 star rating for its use and effect
B003KL0ZO2|5|Love this eau de toilette.  I hope Gap doesn't stop producing it.  I won't know what to do.  This fragrance smells better than most of the expensive brands.  I wear it everyday and always get compliments.
B005ZY7NCY|5|This is amazing stuff! Won't use any other lotion on my body, and smells awesome. Leaves my body feeling well moisterized all day.
B009ZW4J0G|5|someone placed some in our bathroom at work and it smelled so good I had to get me some for home.
B005TT8UJK|4|Nice but needs to be applied liberally and up to two times after 3or 4 hours. This is fruity like green apples. Isn't my favorite of the few I purchased only because I don't care much for green apples. It is nice for Summer or Spring and if you enjoy fruity apple scents. It starts with a medicine eucalyptus smell but quickly fades to green apples.
B001ET7IM4|3|There's supposed to be a count of 8. I only got one count of 1. In a small Amazon box.  Giving it a posting of 3 so it's not disregarded.  Be Careful...
B00374HKVS|4|Long lasting and very refreshing scent!
B001773ZIO|5|I stongly recommend this item, easy to use and perfect especially for my oily skin.  My skin therapist was really pleased with the change on my face as the dark spots were all diminished, she did not have to work as hard on my face as before.  Go for it, great product.
B002WJOOIQ|5|I got this after trying a sample at my tanning salon.  I have used many others in the past, got to say that for me, this is just as good if not better than the more expensive products.  Goes on smooth, light fragrance, soaks right in to the skin, no funny smell after tanning.  I do leave on until next day to shower to get full effect of bronzer.  Leaves my skin very smooth, looking healthy and no greasy feel to it.  I will be getting more of this.  Great product.
B001TSJ7ZQ|5|These are nice quality bobby pins. I've had cheap ones before, but these are of great quality. Don't fall out of your hair.
B002P8M6OS|5|Love this product -- second one I've purchased and it makes my hair look fantastic. Been using it for a few years now and everyone asks how I get my hair to look so nice and curly. Great product since I could never curl my hair w/ a regular iron with the clamp.. ends of my hair would look ridiculous. Heats up quickly -- glove is included. Two [non-burned] thumbs UP! :)
B002S8TPHQ|5|I use this concealer mainly for my undereye area to cover the dark blue circles. I consider this a true porcelain shade that's on the cooler side of neutral in tone. You only need to use a very small amount in the corners of the eyes and pat outwards to get coverage; apply too much and it'll look pasty and unnatural.<br /><br />This can cover pimples and discoloration, too. It dries down quickly and almost powdery but the formula itself isn't drying and blends easily. As long as it's used sparingly it won't get cakey.. I've been impressed with just about all the NYX makeup I tried so far, especially this concealer and the eyeshadow singles.
B00IARB1S0|4|Very pretty and the leather is of a durable quality.  The longer I have had it the Better it looks. I keep my pricey eye liners and make brushes in there. I have gotten many compliments.
B000CN2OIQ|1|I expected lot more. Other than the bragging right, this perfume was highly over priced for the quality. I will not buy it again.
B0025FL8TK|5|While this is definitely expensive for a man's hairbrush, it is worth it to me. It is handmade and a fine piece of old world craftmanship that I have long wanted but just couldn't bring myself to spend the money. After one miscue with another merchant, I ordered and received this brush as promised and am throughly enjoying this and other Kent brushes which I ordered through Amazon.
B007NN35KE|5|A great product to help fill in thinning places at my temples.
B005FJQQMC|5|absolutely love the fact that it is ten different size dotting tips. most dotting tools have five different ones on one side and all the same size on the other side of the dotting toll!!
B002HSIJKQ|5|I have combination skin that has some dry patches with an oily T zone.  Before I bought this cleanser, my face had reached an all-time \\"low\\", as zits and blackheads had erupted all over my forehead and cheeks, and it was a lot more oily than usual.  I was using a scrub, cleanser, and toner--all by Lancome, all costing around $25 apiece.  I thought that switching to Lancome from Clearasil would be a great upgrade, but clearly, my money could have been better invested.  Fortunately, on a whim, I decided to try this cleanser after seeing it in the Vitamin Shoppe (I was particularly interested in trying something without fragrance).  Well, it has turned out to be one of my best purchases.  Within weeks I could see visible changes on my face: many zits had cleared up, it was less oily throughout, and just looked healthier in general.  I am absolutely certain that this cleanser has made all the difference.  Today my face is in its best shape ever; zits will only pop up after a missed wash.  I wear a lot of makeup, but this cleanser is all I need to wipe the layers of blush, bronzer, concealer, and foundation (I only use makeup remover for my eyes/mascara).  The ingredients are excellent, and it lasts forever--in at least 9 months, I have not even used half the bottle!  Definitely a product worth trying; if nothing else, it's cheap!
B0058EFDUA|5|I really like the product. holds longer than normal eye drops. Very easy to apply. Usually apply at night and in the morning
B00FGAHZ02|5|I was lucky enough to be able to review this product. I must say it is an amazing supplement, easy to take and seems to be working well. My skin is already feeling smoother with much less texture. I am also noticing a brighter appearance as well as a more plump look around my fine lines. I will definitely continue this product.
B006MNILCS|5|LOVE!!!!!
B00GBC0JVG|1|I ordered two of these.  One was broken upon receipt.  That sucked, but things like this happen in logistics.  No fault of amazon.<br /><br />That being said, these things are flimsy, thin pieces of crap.  The fact that they're $40 is purely for the fact that they're acrylic to save weight.  If you want a quality nail polish rack, build one, it's easy, google the instructions, make your own modifications.  My wife loves nail polish.  I'm building her a rack.  I'm going tomorrow to buy the supplies because we can't find one worth a damn on the entire friggin internet.
B00ZKLLZAI|3|Did a shopper Army review. I like the 2 step process but better texture and flavor would have got me to give more stars.
B000G647Y8|1|It scratches!
B001841FKQ|5|worked out great
B003N3J41M|5|This is my 3rd bottle, the first one my husband bought it for me. I love the scent, is light and soft. And it seems to last all day and night. I recommend it to the ladies...
B005DI88US|5|I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Theses brush heads fit my older model sonicare perfectly. The quality of the product is excellent.
B005G48WI2|5|This is a great lipstick it glides right on ur lips u can use it with or without gloss and it is true to color if your looking for a baby pink. Will be buying more kaior products in the future love them!
B000TG850M|1|I was considering buying this conditioner because it came up when I searched for organic products; however, this line is NOT organic. In their ingredient list, Methylchloroisothiazolinone appears. This is a widely-used preservative in products and is a known human immune system toxicant. It is restricted in other countries production lines. Check it out at cosmeticsdatabase.com. Always make sure the ingredients are safe before you buy.
B001RKDGR6|4|The quality of Essie polish is always the best, but I was disappointed in how the color turned out vs. what it looks like in the picture online- it is a few shades darker in real life. It is a very true blue- the exact shade of blue you would want to paint your nails for 4th of July for a red, white, and blue theme. Be warned that if you're looking for a lighter, more cerulean blue, this is not it.
B00LO2D89S|3|I love it, but I have to store it with my necklaces, so it doesn't get tangled.
B0012RXAGG|1|I received this item - Nina By Nina Ricci For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.7-Ounces - on the last week of January'11, and was very disappointed.<br />The scent does not last long compared with the one I had in the past and there were black tint all over the bottle. It seems to be a display item or even a fake one.<br />I am really surprised given the reviews above!
B00T3XJNH6|5|Although initially I found this item ridiculous, I now find this product very useful.  The PurePedi is gentle and effective.  I recommend this product.
B000XQQ8GQ|5|I just received this 2 days ago and have been applying to the eye area morning and night.  I can't believe my puffy eyes have been eliminated!  And the dark circles have already decreased.  I will not be without this.  P.S. i'm 52
B008B9L6WS|5|This cream is by far the best I've tried! Since I usually avoid using products with fragrance, I was a bit hesitant to try this. Now that I have, I'm glad I did! The fragrance is very light and pleasant, and it almost disappears after application. It leaves your skin super soft and smooth, without that greasy feeling I hate. Plus, it stays on even after washing your hands. Thanks, gold bond, for such a great product!
B002HMYF8W|5|Exactly what I was looking for, Love the fragrant smell and very happy with how it cleans. Thanks!
B0012RX16K|5|fine
B002BS43HU|2|Not sure but maybe for someone else is great
B00008W7H4|3|I bought this razor to replace an inexpensive Remington I've had for years.  I thought the idea of shaving in the shower sounded good and would cut down on the dust created from shaving with the Remington.  I've had it for over a year and I've never gotten a really complete shave with it.  I use the Remington to finish or just a regular razor.   <br /> <br />I think the Panasonic quality is first rate....however the performance does not justify the price.
B0013NB7DW|5|I have always use an electric razor and since I found out about this product and been<br />using it I do not scratch my face anymore.... It's AWESOME!!!!!
B00CLK2EA6|5|I use this oil as part of my moisturizing products for my face.  It is gentle, smells great and keeps my skin soft.  I also use almond oil in my ear before going to the doctor to get wax cleaned out of my ears.
B001EUE7UY|4|i love this item very much but<br /><br />1- Its very thick so don't put too much in your hand, if you put too much the razor will remove nothing from its thickness<br /><br />2- while messaging my face before shaving i saw small amount of foam so i won't consider it 100% non foaming gel<br /><br />3- its not burning at all On the contrary i feel that the mint is not too much in that shaving gel
B001JBC386|1|Beauitful Perfumes sent another bag instead of The Donnna Karan Hobo bag they advertised through Amazon.com when I called Beauitful Perfumes to let them know the tremendous error I spoke with \\"Sarah\\" (Customer Service)who told me at the end of our conversation that it was the same bag, after first aknowledging and telling that they (Beautiful Perfumes) made an error by not following protocol<br />and contacting me to let me know they were out of the bags I ordered, giving me the liberty to make a decision as to how I would spend my money; but instead someone on Beautiful Perumes staff decided for me how they would spend my hard earned money and I received a bag I didn't order. It's doen't even have the same likness as the Hobo bag, it cheap, cheesy and poor in quality. Sarah said they were out of the bags I ordered so that's what I got.  Then changed from tha story to the end of the conversation story, it's the same bag.  So buyer beware you may oreder one iteam and receive another. Can this be a sign of the time? When a companies have over stocked merchandise, that's not moving. I don't like how Beautiful Perfumes handled my order. Extremely unprofessional.[[ASIN:B001JBC386 Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan for Women 4 Piece Holiday Set Includes: 1.7 oz Eau de Toilette Spray + 2.5 oz Body Lotion + 2.5 oz Body Cleansing Lotion + DK Fashion Hobo]]
B001KZ6710|4|this healed my cracked/ chapped lips, taste and smell great! love it! I would definately recommend to others only thing is the high price
B001440150|4|This product works great for me. I have sensitive skin and psoriasis so I always have to be really careful about what kinds of soaps and lotions I use. Alba Botanica doesn't make my skin break out or get irritated. It is one of the few products with a scent that I can use. I recommend the mint or honey mango!
B000C21AC8|5|I use this cologne every day Its my favorite. it got here in time, the packaging was perfect .<br />great job to the seller. I've used this cologne for 15 years and I've had lots of people ask what it was called and where I got it.<br />well I'm disappointed that I can't get it in the stores anymore, but I'm glad I can depend on people like you to find it for me<br />  Thank you from the bottom of my heart
B0037QG7CY|1|Do not buy from this person. This is the worse fake bottle of cologne I've ever seen. The top silver part of the bottle (the cap) is plastic. It's supposed to be like a metal material. The glass bottle was so poorly made and it was leaking out of the cap, right out of the box. LOL. The box it came in was another story but i won't get into that, but it looked fakely made as well. The silver paint from the plastic is flaking off extremely bad. The label that says Gucci on the bottle is flaking off too. The worse part of this is the scent, it smells really good, but, it lasts for like 5 minutes just like the knock-offs that you can buy from cheap stores and stuff. Read the other reviews from the people that bought it (and didn't realize it was a fake), even they said the smell doesn't last very long too. I am soooo pissed off. This was supposed to be a Christmas present. I know for a FACT that Gucci would never make something like this. You bastard!
B00A8M0ARI|5|show a color different in just 2 uses.
B000CSLIII|5|works on the best day espectacular nextr day not that great but make my curls look great so is a good investment for a party or so!!
B0001M1IAI|5|good but to large . Thank you any way these were worth. I strongly recommend for adult and those who have SPA.
B001429U3Q|4|I got the DivaWash after using Dr. Bronner's Mild Castile Soap for awhile, and realizing that castile soap IS NOT the best thing to use on a silicone cup. Castile soap is oil-based, and oil causes the silicone molecules in the cup to become unstable which may leach from the cup into your system. Silicone is similar to a lot of other rubbers (like latex) which can be broken down when it comes in contact with oil. I knew something was odd after I began noticing my cup starting to look &#34;cloudy,&#34; as if it were being damaged in some way. Diva International doesn't outright say this, but after doing a bit of investigating, this is the most plausible explanation to me. The castile soap was also not getting my cup as clean as I thought it should, it left a foggy film (from the oil).<br /><br />I've been using the DivaWash for several months now and I think it is just fine. It gets my cup clean and smelling nice and fresh (unlike castile soap) and doesn't really leave any residue. The thing about this soap is that you must make sure you rinse it THOROUGHLY, because the soap is very sudsy and you don't want to leave any excess soap on the cup. The soap is gentle enough to be used to clean the cup, but is not recommended for internal use so it may cause some (very slight) irritation if any soap is left on the cup prior to insertion.
B006R2NDYU|5|Price was excellent. I've been using this product for years. I would recommend this product to any one.  Thank you
B004QRVF3Y|1|Didn't really make my skin tan
B0082CKCJ2|5|Fragrance wonderful and light.<br /> Absorbs easily. Great product.
B00H4F6MPQ|5|As described. Love it! Great for synthetic hair looks real.. Color is perfect ! Mixed blonde blends great. Thanks for the great buy.
B0051UKI4W|1|Damaged labels on products. Did not appear to be new items.
B0085TFDHI|5|classroom
B001ET6ZFU|4|I really did like this product a great deal until I discovered it could be linked to cancer and organ system toxicity, according to Skin Deep Safety Cosmetic Database. With my research, I discovered just how toxic most of what I was putting on my skin really was!  I am now using face naturals and they are completely natural and organic and receive the best score on Skin Deep Safety Cosmetic Database.  [...]
B003ICXCG6|4|It is good. the Wind is strong. The price is reasonable.  But I think it is a little too big.
B001GN87FA|5|Love this fragrance waiting on the Roxy Love Eau de Toilette to get in stock .
B008HBMRRS|5|Great for dry, sensitive skin. Unlike other cleansers, has not been clogging my pores. It's pretty thick, so a little goes a long way. Smells strongly of sage; doesn't bother me but could be an issue if you don't like the smell. Does wonders for my winter skin without causing breakouts. Would buy again.
B001E96MW6|1|This hand cream REEKS of cheap, synthetic fragrance.  And neither does it moisturize well.  Yet another example of how Neutrogena keeps pumping out expensive products that don't work.
B002D1MZ34|3|this product did not last long blades got slow did not stay sharp
B00RL9Y1MQ|5|Great gift.  I especially loved the price.
B00527N2I8|5|Love this product!
B006GQYSGE|5|Arrived promptly, and was as described. Charged it up overnight. Works much better than the original version of this from 20+ years ago! This was bought as a replacement for an earlier model that &#34;died&#34;.
B001PKSY9I|1|i nonly got 1 thrid of a bottle of this product. i couldn't believe it. i expected a whole bottle of it. i was really disapointed
B002Z6LHWW|5|I love this product it's great it smells good I like the bottle  especially all my friends that are guys were asking me what is it where did it and can they put some of mine on all my friends that are girls were saying they loved it that I smelled so good and I love it it smells really good and will buy more of this product
B000068PBT|5|Great service, good price.
B002NC5JP4|4|brush for application bigger than expected, need a smaller brush for better precision. Overall I am happy with the product
B001MA0QY2|5|Product was as described. Fast delivery.
B008PTPSF0|2|I thought there would be more that comes in a pack they did look just like the picture but I wish more then six came in the pack
B000052YM4|5|I got this for my wife, and she really loved it.  I have used it a few times myself and can say it is a nice product.  It spreads evenly all over your face without having to really \\"work it\\" around - either with a dry face or wet to apply.  Gives a terrific clean feeling immediately after rinsing it away.  At the price of $6-9 (depending on shipping) for 6 fl oz it is a great value.<br /><br />I also got her the Alpha face moisturizer which she was not crazy about.
B00A30TH38|5|I've used this venom mask before as an overnight cream and my skin was flawless.  I intend on using it 2x a day now.
B000R8ZCQ2|4|I do like PCA products and this one in particular--it almost feels as if it soaks up all the oil on my face--the only draw back is that you can become excessively dry so follow up with a  good moisturizer--other than that it's great.
B001LNOEKW|5|I stored in my sock drawer, and smells wonderful!  Soaps are great, smell great, and last a long time.  Will purchase again, but may take a while to get through each of the soaps.
B00GDY680I|1|Just recieved my pallet of broken make up!
B00VMECGF0|2|This product did not work that great for me there was nit any change in appearance
B00CD1QU80|5|My razor was delivered on August 19, I charged it overnight, and began using it daily on Aug 20. Today is Sept. 29. Forty days of shaving on a single charge, and it's not dead yet. And I shave my whole face - no beard or moustache. Aside from an amazing battery, the shave itself is close and comfortable. No complaints. Worth every penny.
B000Q6D08W|5|Love me some Loreal.
B001E5EDFS|5|Great product and delivery service!
B00QA5SASS|5|Came very fast and is very soft. I have bought it twice and am very happy with the product.
B00185P5VA|5|Totally Tiffany's blue . I held my nails up to a box and it looks exactly the same . I wore this polish out tonight and people adored it . Worth every penny . Will order again .
B002URU6UA|5|product was just as I hoped it would be. It came in a very timely manner also.<br />I would recommend this vendor.
B007RZ16DQ|5|Awesome product. Love it and will def. purchase more in the near future ... Will recommend product to friends. Thank you!
B00008BRR6|5|I really just needed the Anti Fog mirror. Great quality for the price. I haven't had a real issue with the mirror fogging up bad for short use.
B00P3D8E84|5|I have tried so many products to try and get my hair healthy again. I am not sure what has happened to my hair in the last year but it is so frizzy and dry. I was reading reviews on another product when I saw someone mention how much they liked Cashmere Falls so I started reading these reviews and felt I should try this in hopes it would be my answer. I have been using the product for a week now and I have to say my hair is getting softer and softer the more I use it. I have not had these results this quick with any other product. I really like that it is good for my skin also. Its just an overall really good product at a really good price.
B0045OR410|5|My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this shampoo and the conditioner.  My old hair is a little less curly and a lot drier.  I tried this for a week and was amazed at the difference.  Finally, I found treatments that work!
B000OR5JQ4|5|Opi rates five stars.  Their service was prompt and accurate.  Their product was first class. High quality and as I headlined, both beautiful and elegant.  I would recommend their nail lacquer to all ladies who want to look first class.  It is very artistic and looks great for either evening formal wear or fun, kicked-back relaxation for shopping, parties or beach wear.  You won't go wrong with Opi.
B008N1SJX8|5|I have been using the [[ASIN:B000MVYJ0O One With Nature Dead Sea Mud Dead Sea Minerals Soap]] for over a year. It was cheap, long lasting, great value. I decided to try this at is similarly priced and also has free add-on shipping.<br /><br />One of the main differences from the Dead Sea Mud, which I love, is the smoother/non-grainy texture of the soap. I personally prefer the Dead Sea Mud for it grainy exfoliating properties, but this bar of soap is still great.<br /><br />The Dead Sea Mud offered no scent at all, whereas this bar does have a Eucalyptus scent. The scent is definitely mild, but it is there. Some people may prefer a more poignant smelling bar. I actually like that the scent is mild and not overpowering.<br /><br />In terms of cleaning properties I think it does a perfectly adequate job. I think I will be keeping both this bar and a Dead Sea Mud bar in my shower at all times depending on the mood I am in. Sometimes I want an exfoliating bar, sometimes I want a bar with a little more fragrance. Both are of the same quality and same value. I strongly recommend either of those two soaps.
B001DXLD40|4|I love this paste.  When I seen this travel size i thought it would be perfect for traveling.  But I don't recognize the size and what it means.  This .75 oz is really small.  I couldn't use it for a trip longer than a few days.  If I were commenting on just the paste I would have given 5 starts, but i marked down bc of the size.But the paste is great.  I have to have my hair back in a bun everyday for work and this for the most part keeps my flyaways in check.  And it doesn't make the hair hard like some products.
B000HWKEFC|3|I thought that this was going to be bigger than it actually is. The balm is creamy and smells like mint, just wish they made it in a larger size!
B00871FF2M|1|looks nothing like the picture!!! not to happy
B0002XY3QC|1|I was expecting an amazing top coat because I love Rejuvacote so much. WRONG. It was thin and didn't dry as quickly as Seche Vite. It also smeared my nail art and bled.
B0046VX1IM|4|It's easy to make this cleaning solution for spray and swiffer type mops and it smells like natural clean not chemically clean.
B004P2NJT8|5|I have been using Philosophy products for 7 years and I truly have make-up optional skin.  I am 36 years old and my skin looks better than anyone that I know.  These am pads are a must have part of my skincare regimen.  I also use the pm pads in addition to purity, microdelivery cleanser & weekly treatments and hope in a jar.  I mix in a few other products here and there but I cannot be without these pads.  Amazon, as always, is a great value as well.
B001QY8QXM|5|I was using Wilkinson Sword Classic razors for the past 6 months and just switched to these. OMG what a big difference! The Astra blades don't pull on my hair like the Wilkinson razors did and now get a much more comfortable shave using fewer passes. Totally recommend.
B000P1S0N8|2|Does not seem to do anything. Maybe some very slight relief ... but could be my imagination.
B00LKSVFI2|4|This is a nice, useful mirror.  It doesn't stand very tall, and it certainly doesn't take up much room on the bathroom counter.  You can leave it out without making the bathroom look cluttered.  I wish that it had a light, but you can't beat the price!  I definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a nice makeup mirror (or a mirror that you use to pluck the hair out of your face).
B005UKRRKG|3|This is an awesome palate. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because you have to put a lot of it on in order for the color to appear on your skin (fair toned).
B00028M3N2|5|love it, but have since stopped using it in my burners because I've heard it's bad for cats.  BUMMER!  Makes the whole house smell amazing.
B002BQ3DJG|5|Excellent product! Doo Grow Products delivers results!
B0046MGLC4|5|Received timely. Have been using about a month and my nails look better than they ever have.  Not sure if they actually grow faster but they are stronger and don't peel and tear off like before.  First time I have had real nails that look good.
B004KS0OE0|1|I buy these a lot but for some reason the box I got only about 5 of them would actually stick to my nails. I've never gad this problem until I bought these.
B000C1VYHU|4|I like the reaction cologne this is my first time purchasing this cologne, I'm okay with it , I must agree with every one els it does not last long , it does smell okay not a bad smell , I can see wearing this cologne day or night , any given day any occasion !
B000KVH1QU|5|This is EXACTLY what I've been looking for! I tried the cornstarch/baby powder method of old, but I didn't like the smell or care for the texture and it was difficult to distribute evenly through my hair. The aerosol spray solves that problem. As for the smell, I consider myself to be very picky about scents, but once the smell dissipated after being sprayed, I never noticed it again.    This has been my life-saver not just for a post-gym freshen up (which it is AMAZING for), but also as a busy on-the-go mom with long locks, it saves me a day or two in between shampoos--even in the hot, humid Midwest summers. I'm a huge fan! And you can't beat the price.
B00KHYGNDW|3|I must admit that, though I like it (writing on my son's account) and it certainly moisturizes the eye area, it also burns briefly. I do confirm that it has helped my eye area, but it's not as refreshing as I'd hoped.
B000OUBC8A|5|I don't know how I've been living without this brush. I have super curly fine hair and it tangles so easily it's annoying. This brush gets out EVERY tangle with ease! IM SO EXCITED!! haha..my only piece of advice with this brush, especially becausebit has so many bristles, is to always start at the bottom of your hair and work your way up. Never start at your roots. This brush is amazing, I love it and the shipping was awesome. It came with NO damage. Thanks a lot, it's my new staple.
B002VECJ7K|5|This powder has been my favorite for decades!!
B005D08XRE|3|Ok didn't really seem to make a difference but did not my me breakout.
B001LF4DYW|5|Beautiful holder and great fresh smell.
B002RW7NBI|5|Cool and soothing to eyes and eyelids.  This product is great for de-puffing eyes and eyelids.  I will use again.
B0012BNVE8|5|Exactly what is says.
B00DEJW7IW|2|You need alotttt of nail polish for it to look like Its actual color. But other than that it's pretty
B002JPJ2ZS|5|I've posted reviews on this before - with continued use this really works. My hair never grew in right after having chemo. It was very thin, patchy and had no texture. I bought this on the advice of a hairdresser. It took about 3-6 months to actually physically see results and after 1 year, everyone noticed. I purchase this on auto-ship now. It really does work, but you need to give it time - it isn't an overnight fix.
B007ROD09K|5|Great small size hot towel cabi for whatever your spa profession is. Small jobs like facials or massage are perfect companion to any size room. Gets very hot and fast.
B000FEGUIM|5|Love this razor.  Gets the job done, battery lasts for at least a week's worth of shaves.  Definitely no flaws and no reason to spend hundreds of dollars when this razor gets the job done.
B0018A32XS|4|Was given as a Christmas gift and she is happy with it.
B0002Z8FWS|4|this  is not smear proof but it does look good. However, at the end of the day, I have smudges  on my lower lid.
B00H8Z7DIM|2|felt good on your feet--but mine smelled very hot when using and the cord was too hot to touch to unplug at times--seller did respond to my return of this item with no problem of getting a refund.
B00F008GFQ|5|Dense and soft.  Full coverage.  Better than many professional brushes!
B007V3LUSA|3|suction cup works really well if you have a perfectly smooth surface to apply it to.  If you don't there is no way to mount it to your ceramic tile.  I bought a 1/8&#34; thick 5&#34; plexiglass circle and this did the trick.
B002EP9OUG|4|It's a little bigger than I expected
B0019LV2QU|4|You get what you pay for.  This is thick, pleasant textured and low odor.  I used it for DIY lotion bars and really appreciated the obvious quality.
B004A7VFWG|5|The Olay Body Lotion Silk Whimsy Pump, 11.80-Ounce (Pack of 2) is a bargain. I use it daily. Light fragrance not over powering. Easy to pump. Never leaks.  I bought the matching body wash for my showers.
B001AY7R5Q|4|I got these for stocking stuffers for my daughters, and kept one for myself since they came in a three pack.  It is pretty straightforward, and does what a warming scrub should.
B0043SHCKG|5|This product was definitely a good deal for me. No surprises about the delivery estimated time and especially (and much more important) because the product that arrived here was exactly what I was expecting.<br /><br />The seller did everything just like promised and I will have no hesitation in buying something with him again if I get interested by any of his products.<br /><br />By the way, this bottle has an excelent size for saving money by buying in big quantities, so a definitely recomend it!
B001A15H4C|5|Used it for years, and now that it's discontinued, can't find anyting comparable.<br />It was the best for fine, colored hair.
B003C168Q4|5|This is one of the product's children's Hospital used on my new born son for a diaper rash.  It worked so well that I now only use the items the hospital used.
B0054Y2744|5|Being using this for years.
B007VTNQIG|5|I gave these as a gift. They were great stocking stuffers.
B000UPOBRI|4|Good quality. Has helped a lot
B00PJ5W8XS|5|Perfect, just what I was looking for. Good quality, shipped quickly.
B002HRENPW|5|Very well made mirror with a nice protective pouch.
B000X1LOJM|5|I have been using this for the past 4 years. It works great and removes all my makeup. I use it before I use my face wash. It is the only makeup remover I use. The only downfall is the price which I think is outrageous.Still this is a quality product that I think I will continue to use until I find something that works better.
B003APH3FM|5|Infusion Keratin Replenisher - Keratin Complex is a great hair product, very pleased with this hair product, bought 5 bottles, it makes dried hair soft, healthy and shiny, my hair was looking damaged due to coloring, tried it and now it looks soft and healthy.
B00021C1LI|5|Love this product it lasts for AGES because you only have to use a tiny bit. It's not like other cleansers, it slides around easier so you need the tiniest drop! So one bottle with last you probably a year of just the tiniest bottle! Makes the price worth it. Also this leaves me with healthy feeling, porcelain looking skin and even skin tone I just can't find other moisturizers EVER do the same! Even leaves me feeling moisturized.
B00KSEEZRM|5|While on our honeymoon the wife fell in love with this stuff and unfortunately ran out of the bottles we got from the cleaning staff. Bought it to give to the wife as part of her anniversary present and she was very excited.
B00EFAHB7G|5|I BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTERS WEDDING -- SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL -- THIS JUST ADDED TO HER BEAUTY!!!
B00JMG5QHU|5|luv
B00198ZOU8|5|Great great great Great bun. I easily do a bun now. Good service too. Cheap and affordable. Li ke it
B00K5SR8TI|1|I didn't even open the package cos' you can tell it's broken from the smell!!
B0059B5NM0|5|A great, sweet, fresh scent.  I bought the him version too, and I mic them, but that is just me.  I love the hints of Patchouli and you can almost smell Nag Champa!
B00O117X2M|5|Comfortable and blocks the morning sun well.
B001BR97A0|5|If you have large facia pores, you have to use this and will notice a difference in less than 7 days!!
B009YOGWAK|1|IAM SO SAD .... and dispointed  when they deliver it to me .......I couldn't use it because it looked so frickin CHEAP. I strongly advise NOT TO PURCHASE THIS BAG. ... ITS WASTE OF MONEY
B00JX979CQ|5|I started using oils on my face a few  years ago and it has changed my skin for the better in so many ways. I didn’t realize what Emu Oil was at first until I researched it a bit. It is actually from the emu animal! Apparently it has some incredible healing properties and is fantastic for skin, hair and nails. It has healed the cracks on my poor, dry winter hands. I have also mixed a few drops into my night moisturizer for my face. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft without being too oily. This 4-oz  bottle is a great value & will last for a very long time since you only need a drop or two.
B008YQLEIO|5|Love this cologne on my husband! Not over powering. I think it would be a good signature scent for any man of any age. Really happy I can order it online.
B006CQWGXU|3|Color was nice and came when expected.
B001ET7D9C|5|I've been using this roll-on for years and nothing else comes close in doing the job. It keeps me dry and fresh all day. I know I sound like a commercial, but it's the truth. My biggest fear is that they'll stop making it.
B002Q4UC1U|4|loved them
B002HZ029A|4|I really like this product, it is quite lovely and elegant. It arrived fresh and well packaged. In contrast to the more common types of shea butters (west african) this shea butter is a very light, soft and creamy, white colored butter. I am an african american female and I apply this to my face (during the evening) as a moisturizer after I wash my face with african black soap. I would say it is a little too light to use on my hair (type 4AB), I continue to use west african shea butter (100% Unrefined Certified Grade A Shea Butter by AAA Shea Butter Company) which I will never give up. I gave a rating of 4 stars because it can be quite greasy once it is applied to the face and hands so it is suggested to use very little portions. A very little goes a long way.
B004OHQR1Q|5|I purchased my dotting tools from Case2 and it shipped from Hong Kong and I got it earlier than the expected arrival!! All the dotting pens are different sizes as well. I'm so excited to use them!!!
B0054LHI5A|5|I've used this product for years and haven't had any problems with it so far. Definitely keeps my lips hydrated, and the peppermint has a soothing cooling effect.
B0099EHM86|2|Unfortunately this didn't cure my dandruff. Still searching for a good product to get it done .. Their conditioneconditioners are great though !
B000E7YK7S|5|floral yet leathery, great from morning to night
B0010EPQ36|3|Smells great at first application, after awhile tends to smell like furniture polish. Goes on smooth and leaves hands feeling soft.
B004X5CJ3E|5|I think I might just throw out any other blush I have. This gives you a fresh rosy glow, and my cheeks have a nice flush all day. If you are using as a lip tint, you will need to reapply every few hours. I'll order the large bottle when I run out of this sample size and then just refill the sample size for travelling purposes.
B001MP7HYY|5|Great brushes for applying hair color. I really didn't need 3 but this is great deal. They're a good size too, not tiny or anything.
B001FSK736|5|its the best i tried everything and purchased so many tools this is by far the only best! im a hairstylist and love it
B00CZ7A4D4|3|This was a good bargain. It has several attachments that are useful; however, it does not have much power, so you do not feel the full effect of a quality facial brush .
B005F3VLXM|5|Good stuff but I wish it wasn't an add on item I know amazon does that to sell more stuff but I still don't like it
B00AZRGH64|5|love this
B000ZN3D4C|4|For the price it is great. Just clean it with toothpaste every morning and it will lasts for about a year or more.
B003H87S0C|5|I wish I had this peel years ago.  I use it every day for that clean feeling of starting fresh each day.  My sister-in-law referred it to me and she was told about it by her sister.  It's a family tradition now.
B009LSA6RY|5|Great quality for the price, way nicer than I expected. I have a Minerva classic black plastic shampoo bowl and it made it look so much nicer than those crappy black plastic hoses that will spray you and your client in the face if you don't grab it first before you turn it on.<br />I own a salon studio and don't have a sink, so now I can rinse out my color bowls so much easier and with less time without getting color all over my hands and the shampoo bowl nozzle.<br />Water pressure is a little less than anticipated but it works great. I can rinse color just fine and the sprayer option doesn't spray people in the face!<br />Completely worth the $40.
B00CIAB6DK|5|These headbands are great! I've ordered many colors and always get compliments on them at work. Always fast shipping and the prices are great! Will probably order more in the future!
B000JLIRT6|5|i ordered the 36 pack case of degree deodorant. i loved the product, they are travel sized and my teen daughters are using them to stuff (along with other things) slumber party, party bags. their friends think its cool.
B000JL3U1Q|5|My mother loves this fragrance [and the cute bottle], I got it to her for Mother's Day last year here on Amazon.  Great scent.  I would also suggest Marc Jacobs' Daisy which smells even better.
B000OLAMGC|3|I got this because I read it helps with dark circles. It doesn't do much of anything. It's not bad, but not great.
B00BNHM36I|5|I have searched YEARS to find dye that actually produces bold vibrant colors.  Not only that - but dye that lasts and fades well.  The worst thing ever is when you dye your hair and you LOVE it - but....as it fades...it starts to look really gross and doesn't &#34;age&#34; well as it lightens.  This brand also isn't so harsh that it dyes your scalp.  Granted - be careful around your face etc as (well obviously it is vivid) it will dye your skin a bit.  Anyone who wants beautiful orange hair - this is for you.  I actually do an ombre fading from Pravana red to Pravana Orange.  All of their colors are amazing.
B006FY88SG|4|My wife goes through pocket tissues all the time. These are hard to find in bulk. If I had to buy these at the drug store I would pay more. At the dollar store, you don't always get the quality. These are the best quality, and the price is good.
B000CNO4ES|5|I bought this fragrance years ago and haven't been able to find it again till now it's still the best ever
B00GTBZHUW|4|I really like the Suave kids product line and this is no exception.  They produce some good products that really work.  This is a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  It is easy to use and has a peach type scent.  MY kids like the smell and the ease of use.  The product is also tear free which is great.  The bottle also has a fun fact on the back which my kids like to read and they are usually pretty interesting.  Overall another great product and I will continue to use the Suave kids products for my children.
B004I9OXWK|5|i love this product! i i use obagi products , but i love to use this once a week !!!
B00H6TPT90|5|Very nice product. I have bought this repeatedly and will again.
B008K992HU|4|Very nice works better in shower or wet<br />but best shaver for the money
B00I6Z3666|4|Love this product! it gives your skin a nice natural glow and feels very moisturizing.
B0049LUI9O|5|I've been given things like this in the past - most worked so so<br />This unit is very user friendly - cuts cleanly - no tugging on nose or ear hairs.
B00LU1V3JK|5|Cream is very nice consistency. I have had trouble in the past with eye creams being either too oily and/or too heavy with little effect. Best eye cream yet!
B0046VJV36|2|i think before you buy this ones, better tried them in the stores and keep restocking, this was like white concealer
B00M7JHFX2|1|Sorry to say, this broke within the first week!!! Will NOT purchase again. Thank you....
B004BHB25A|5|I''ve been wanting to buy this eye liner for  long time, so I finilly found this one in amazon for $4,17 and just loved it! The professinal brush in it makes a perfect line even if you are not good with eyeliners, Its better than the liquid ones because you dont have to wait until it Dries off and it lasts for a long time, It doesnt came off easily, You can easily make different looks that you always wanted but you would always mess up! Love it!! 100% recomend! Worth for the price!  Tai
B0008D7UKM|5|It's a great cover. I especially like the rubbered edges, most covers have smooth edges. The rubbered edges helps to keep your phone in your pocket. This cover makes me happy just looking at the daisies. I would recommend this cover to anyone.
B0035VBP50|5|I used to spend a lot more money for my skincare, till I started using this.  Cheaper over the counter stuff made me break out and I'm 51, so I thought I was doomed to continue using expensive Lancôme which I love and have used for years.  But this is a fraction of the cost of Lancôme and I get the same results.  This has more natural ingredients and I don't break out.
B00A51P1VC|4|They all came in tact and the bristles were soft. They smell like spray paint so they need airing out. But hey totally worth the price you get them at :)
B002L9Z7SI|5|I love this product. I originally tried it at Kohl's and it's rich and creamy. It makes your skin feel rich and soft,I bought it  online at Amazon and saved a bundle iver the Kohl's price
B008LDFU26|3|It didn't make a difference to my skin... Everyone has different skin, this product isn't for my skin though I know it works for other people's skin.
B00DOXNRP0|5|Bought this for the Bride to wear to a Bachelorette &#34;Wiggin Out&#34; Party. The color is super fun and for her it fit very well. Definitely recommend this for fun events.
B00TQ22TFM|2|Many of the reviews state they get close shaves, not for me, close is not the word I would use. I have to believe there are better shavers out there. Easy to clean.
B0009MHJE4|5|I'm trying to use more natural products for my beauty routine and this is a great gateway. I love it!
B00J98TQ2M|4|Awesome very happy
B000UVX7KE|5|Great product I recommend .
B00861RXNW|5|There awsome! Came quick
B009PG4URE|5|Great feel on your skin, really good moisturizer not al all dry love this product alot should be a regular product
B001R5L2TU|5|good
B00Q56PATY|5|I work at a tanning salon and I use this lotion myself. I have to say this lotion is amazing, smells wonderful, will not burn you, and gice tou that great bronze color you want with 1-2 uses. Plus it has collagen in it to tighten your skin and decrease fine lines.
B000PY17PI|5|This is my favorite styling brush and I can't find it in any of the stores anymore.  The barrel is the<br />perfect size and it grips the hair without tearing it.
B000E3YO4G|5|I just turned 30 and naturally I decided to look for something to help with maintaining my skin.  Genetically I have very visible pores, and is highly susceptible to getting pimples which sometimes makes it difficult to find a good moisturizer that will not clog my pores.  I got way more with this.  My skin feels soft and moisturized after each use.  I am able to go on without makeup, also is a good base for my powder since I don't use foundation. This is definitely a keeper.  I am Haitian-American.
B003QSFBHA|5|These are great because they stay in place!  They don't slip out in the middle of your pedicure.
B008U1Q4DI|3|They are OK. I think they are a lil bit to small for 3D nail art. Maybe I should of went something bigger than 2mm.
B002WYZ4TY|5|The case is great protection for the sulcabrush. keeps it tucked away and clean. great protection
B006DR2DO0|5|I was shocked when I saw the price for this 3 pack of razor refills. I had never seen this tropical scent in the store so I figured I would give them a try. The smell was not overwhelming ad was actually quite pleasant. They also seemed to shave the exact same for me as the ones I buy at my local CVS or Target. I have been waiting to see if they will be available again because I am planning in stocking up on them for the future. I would recommend this product to all of my friends that are looking for this specific type of razor refill.
B00OHXPMCM|5|Been using this Night dream for a month or so. I like how it softens my face. It keeps my face nice and hydrated and I look refreshed in the morning. So far it seems good, I need to give it more time to see how well it does as far reducing fine lines. I don't have them very pronounced don't have hardly any. A few light very fine ones underneath the eyes. I  was blessed with pretty good skin. I so far very pleased with the serums I use (all instanatural beauty products) I use 3 different serums. I apply each one giving each one time to absorb really good, doesn't take long. Within seconds my skin absorbs it in pretty quick. Then I apply this night cream. Oh and after washing my face I use my own toner first and then apply serums making sure my face is nice and clean. Seems like it helps ur face to absorb everthing (serums,creams fairly quick I'd say), so far I'm very pleased with products. Will keep using. Will update in another month.
B00012NDBU|5|Exactly what I had hoped for. I was under stress...came home from work and took 2. It calmed me completely and before bed took 2 more and slept the best I have slept in weeks....so glad I bought this!
B00187EX6G|5|I love this hard to find product, it works great and doesn't break the bank! Perfect for low grade glycol in peel too!
B0042SLLU4|5|Love the scent.
B003EW6E42|5|This product is just as it is discribed - The Seller is gracious and I will suggest my friends to this Sellers items. Lovely Smell and very silky smooth. You will not be disappointed. God bless you all
B00DQSJ7LG|5|I love this product. Well made and very attractive. Will certainly buy it again.
B00GW4OVF8|5|Love these, super soft and blends foundation and concealer beautifully. I hope they last a long time and hope they come out with more types of brushes.
B005MQ2N1G|5|I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH
B0069SQMWW|5|Very powerful and is definitely helping the circulation in my husbands legs. I rub a couple of drops on his feet every night. Will keep it in stock.
B007CMCSNQ|5|Love this product and the price is great.
B00A917LNY|2|As a pregnant woman, I'm very sensitive to smells.  And, bottom line, the smell of this oil makes me gag/vomit.  Which in turn makes me not want to use it, which makes it incredibly ineffective.  The smell also lingers - I apply it at night and can still smell it in the morning.<br /><br />When I suck it up and use it (maybe once a week), I make my husband apply it for me (so my hands don't smell).  It absorbs quickly and isn't greasy (hence 2 stars - it would only be 1 star based on the smell alone).  And I hope that it does work  but it's too soon to tell.
B00QJDXBSU|4|This is a Great product. Easy to work with. Really notice beautiful results
B007ROD09K|4|Warms up quickly. Light weight. Only annoyance is the metal trey on the inside was bent or something and it wont sit straight. Otherwise, it does the job.
B000NW6QH6|5|This takes me back in time forty some years. So glad they still make it.  The aroma lasts a while on the skin and even if it did not, it is a pleasure in the shower.  And this is the first soap that I've found in a long time  that I want to put the wrapper of into my drawers to scent the clothes.
B009GYVMAS|1|Hate it, go with the original one
B00FVXS3DC|5|It took forever to get to my house. I mean like a month forever. I could not track it down for the life of me. I email the company they person i spoke with was really nice. So it just got to my house like this Monday 17,2014. I check the hair out of couese and it is a prefect match to my hair. My hair is thick so 1 package is not going to help you. I got 3 just to be safe. So if your hair is thin 1 pack is ok,but if your hair is thick buy 2 or 3 just to be safe because the hair is a little thin. I love my thick full body hair. Oh and the reason it take so long is because it is coming from china.So be a little patient with your package and it coming though the regular mail as well. But other then the long wait. I love my hair and plan to order more hair from this company.
B00H8Z2LNY|5|Love the products.  I can see a noticeable difference in skin tone, and wrinkles are not as pronounced.  Will continue to use this product!
B00008V407|1|I spent over an hour trying to remove the hair from one calf and still didn't get it all. I changed the pad, thinking I had a bad pad. It still didn't work. This is definitely not the ultimate hair remover. In fact, it hardly removes hair at all. Don't waste your money on this expensive item.
B00433L6IA|4|Smells really good, i get constant compliments when i use this, my wife love it,good fragrance for man, is good for me
B00I13F3SM|5|I was actualy surprised at how well it wotked.  It is almost completely painless as well.  Much less painful than an epilator and takes about the same amount of time.
B00U3NQAOY|5|The hair is soft silky and smooth I recommend this hair for my friends.
B00BTYOBLK|5|Love them
B005FA7GLG|4|Left my hair really oily after a day.
B00GYN9A08|5|Love, love, love. Used for a mask which made my face super soft. I am currently doing a cleanse and am looking<br />forward to using in my bath for further detoxing.
B00WC3KRN8|4|I received a discount for a review of this item. Perfect for wearing under moisturizer and make up. Normally my skin gets a bit greasy and breaks out if I don't put make up on, but this stuff kept my face feeling fresh and clean all day long without make up on. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's sort of a watery consistency which can make it easy to put too much in my hand. I definitely can see a slight improvement  after using this product for almost a week. Excited to see how it helps in the long term.
B000FG8TBG|5|This definitely does have a unique taste... The best I could describe it when I first tried it was &#34;grapefruit cough syrup!&#34;<br />Keep using it and you get used to the taste quickly!  I think it is well worth it, my mouth feels very clean and fresh for a long time after using this mouthwash.  I love that the ingredients are all natural, and no sugars like some of the leading brands.  Definitely give it a try, and if you don't like the taste, you can try diluting it with some water.
B0084NYSTY|5|Beautiful quality and easy to use!
B0006B661K|5|These do work better than any others you buy anywhere in CVS, Walmart, Kmart, or any stores anywhere local. Don't keep buying the cheap ones you will be putting up with cheap crap again if you do.
B002SIKCQO|5|This is my favorite glitter polish!  It looks amazing over a lavender or other pastel-y toned color.  It was my favorite for the winter because it looks like glistening snowflakes.
B001HY2LM8|4|the shippment was lost and halaleveryday reshipped promptly with no problem    my wife enjoys this product very much
B000R41QDY|1|Way too greasy and hard to wash out. Wouldn't recommend it.
B00GYB1E5O|3|My hair is incredibly fine, splits easily, full of disorganized wavy curls, and naturally ULTRA FRIZZY all the time whether it's been brushed, combed, or left alone entirely.  Frizzy is the name of my game, it's always been this way. This product is good for controlling frizz on my hair short term and I like it, especially the smell, but it definitely doesn't stand up to a wash. Maybe if you're the kind of person who has &#34;bad hair days&#34; this would work, but my entire LIFE is a bad hair day.<br /><br />I'm always searching for the holy grail anti-frizz product that will finally calm my hair. This one is fine for a high-maintenance date night hairstyle if you seal it after you're done with hairspray, but if you're someone who needs products just to look normal on an average day it's not the secret weapon you're looking for. Using this product without hairspray, the tightly compacted curls I set my hair into with a curler will come apart into individual frizzy strands within a couple hours... and just using it on my hair naturally without re-curling it's not effective at all.
B002D48R3I|3|didn't make a lot of difference and at that price, yeesh!
B0013FPN1W|1|A waste of money smell like old women perfume
B005Y79DSE|5|WORKS GREAT FOR NAIL DECORATING, IT COMES FROM CHINA SO IT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER, BUT FOR THE PRICE I WAS ABLE TO WAIT
B00C5TPF72|5|Love the colors and its the perfect size for my daughter to keep in her sports duffel bag.  Good price too.
B0097CJ1G6|5|I love my bows and I received the package in a blink of a eye.  I couldn't believe that I received my purchase so fast!
B005V6AJW2|1|The body wash and spray leaked when shipped; the scent is nice but does not last very long either. Very disappointed. I will stick to what I knkow works - Bath and Body Works (in the store purchase).
B00ARF42D4|4|Everything about this trimmer works well. The battery holds a good charge. The adjustable head has plenty of settings. The blades are sharp and move quickly enough so it isn't pulling your hair. The only complaint I have is that the charger has the light on it instead of the unit itself. So you can tell when it's plugged in, but there's no indication of the level of charge or when charging has completed.
B00DRFGKCM|5|I started graying at 21 and have colored my hair since. I have to color my hair every 4 weeks and it is costly to do so. This powder is awesome. About 10 days before I color I have this gray star on the top of my head. This powder has been a god send. I dab the powder with the brush and pat on my &#34;star&#34; and voila it is gone. Also I am a brunette and thankful that I looked at reviews before buying. The blonde is perfect. You will no go wrong adding this to your hair collection.
B007USQ8K6|5|Been using this exact brush style and brand for 15+ years and am a white kid with an enormous afro. Literally if i forget my brush i am turning around.
B004N7FE8Y|5|I was disappointed in the price increase, too.  I do like that it is a pure product, 100% magnesium.  I use it to soak in the tub, but recently found out it is also good for some plants I recently put in the garden.  Who knew??
B00GRTQEAI|4|Not shiny or fake looking, in fact people thought it was my real hair! A bit on the thin side, I noticed the net peaking out a bit on the top sometimes, but perfect for the price. The only downside was that it was a little tight... After a couple hours it kind of gave me a headache. But I love it! Planning on getting the same one in pink and blue :)
B004T3K54U|5|THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. I am a daily mascara wearer. I don't have extremely short lashes, and I don't really have lashes that get compliments, so I think I am in the 'normal' range. This is what I have learned from experience with many lash growth products.. Lashes are literally hair. If you don't actively condition your lashes, they will dry out and break for numerous reasons on top of the natural shed. Mascara is easily the worst thing for your lashes when it comes to drying them out. Hands down, NEVER sleep in your mascara if you want to prevent lash loss. This product is GREAT. I can tell a difference the next day if I miss even a single night! They are straighter, which appears longer, and they are conditioned, so my mascara goes on more smooth, which looks longer. I can see on different areas of my eye that there is definite growth which is clearly obvious.<br />I didn't see any dramatic results as far as length all over, but that could just be me. I have had ZERO shedding that I have noticed. One little secret I have is that I apply this to my eyebrows and WOW. MASSIVE DIFFERENCE. I apply a VERY generous amount (so they look sopping wet when I go to bed). I wanted to reshape my brows and I could regrow hairs in about a week and it was like shaping them from scratch. WORTH BUYING. Period. Dont waste your money though if you're not going to do it every single night and apply a generous amount.
B000GCOL5M|3|These were a little small.
B009H17ODE|1|This floss is garbage. It is too fragile that it's stuck between my teeth, and I tried very hard to take it out. Never buy this product.
B00UKCR4RU|5|This has made my hair shiny and frizz free  I even gave a friend of mine some and it made her hair soft, manageable and shiny. I would recommend this to everyone
B001F51TBI|3|It's okay
B00BKUHJ0S|5|The perfect neon for the beach! I love how bright this color is!
B003UJM9ZC|4|Great curler heats up super super fast. Really like the long cord ( tho it does get tangled ) it is also dual voltage so you can use it while you travel too!.<br />Gives super shiny soft curls that hold very long even in my super thick long hair.<br />Gave it 4 stars because there is no way you can tell the wand is switched on, there is a button with a zero sign and a one sign,but there is no light.So if you want to grab your wand and you forgot it is still on you could really burn yourself!!!
B001F51QG6|5|I love the taste of this mouthwash as it is very refreshing and the clean feeling lasts for many hours.
B00781WYGW|5|BEST bronzer I have ever purchased! It is very sheer but blends very nicely with the skin.
B0084A5RKG|4|The product is exactly what I expected.  The way it was shipped it ended up a bit of a mess inside the container.  I don't know if this could have been avoided.
B005JDPS7I|5|Love this product. Thanks for the fast shipping.
B0047W3QBW|5|I bought Almay mascara due to my very sensitive eyes, but was absolutely delighted the product exceeded my expectations in every way.  I hope they never discontinue this product!
B00DWL660M|5|Perfect
B00J2APFMW|5|My husband loves it. He perfers this over the fancy electric razor.
B00HTEF8N4|1|Missing 20 pieces
B00ARZ5SFA|5|i like the smell very very much. and this is a good size i can afford. i will buy a larger one next time.
B002O1DHGM|5|GREAT WITH POWERS
B00067YSL4|5|I have ordered this product several times and always had top notch service receiving it in a few days.  The order has arrived in the best of condition.
B00HG1JFXY|5|Great product it helped me with my hair loss and the growth where it was loss.  I love this product!
B007ROD2P2|5|Delivered on time. Good price and we have good uses with this.
B000GBID0M|5|I bought this toothbrush to replace my Crest SpinBrush that was eating up too many batteries.  I only have to charge this one every few days and it's WONDERFUL!!!!!
B001C42QO6|2|it's hard to get it to go on evenly...hold it too close to scalp and you get blotches... hold it out and it gets everywhere...made my hair dry and sticky...like straw...certainly wouldn't want anyone to touch it....<br />it does make the hair appear thicker from a distance and therefore could come in handy for a photo shoot...but hair became hard to style afterwards and it just works better to apply some kind of powder directly to the scalp that doesn't get everywhere and make the hair all brittle and horrible...
B004X8JNZS|1|My skin was tortured.
B00MGMPXXE|5|I would purchase this organizer again. I am very pleased with it.
B003WR3QSG|5|Very few hairs have fallen out.  Holds water extremely well.  Dries well too.  They are making me type more words.
B003A777LA|1|I love this brush it help flaten my hair with my flat iron
B000X2FPXC|5|I love this product.
B005WNDWVO|1|Didn't stay on with nail glue at all! !!! Had to throw in garbage<br />Woild not recommend at all! !!
B00KP5TS4Y|4|Overall this is a great tool set.  High quality and does what it should.  The one star deduction is only for the fact I had to go online and figure out the proper use for each tool.  I plan on buying a few more for stocking stuffers this Christmas.
B00UXW9ZHY|5|Once you get past the messy stuff and get your routine it is much easier to deal with. I noticed almost immediately the difference. Dont skip any minutes. 2 is perfect. Your teeth will feel like porclain all day even after eating. I will definately buy this again.
B00HZPOANG|5|This primer does everything a primer should on my lids: it locks my eyeshadow into place and keeps it from creasing. Plus, it's just $1 on the ELF website, you just can't go wrong with this. This works for me just as well as the Urban Decay Primer Potion, but I'd say that I have normal lids. If you have oily lids, it may not work the same for you, but for the price I still think it's worth a try. Highly recommended!
B00GTRY086|5|I've been dealing with scabies for quite awhile. I have spent thousands of dollars on doctors and exterminators all to no avail. Permethrin doesn't help in any way shape or form, in fact it seems to attract them. For the first time ever I feel like I've found the cure. The combo that works best for me personally. I shower with sulfur soap, making sure to leave it on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. After I dry off, I use an entire jar of the sulfur ointment covering every part of my body from my hair to my toes. Making sure to get into all of the crack and crevices where these things like to hide. I also spray my apt. daily with Talstar Pro. The most important step of all is to clean, clean, clean. I have been doing this for about 3 weeks now and I haven't had more than a few bites every 3 or 4 days. I plan to continue this regiment until I am absolutely sure that they're all gone.
B00286SLZA|5|On my second bottle & I love it
B000A1FFRM|5|There are two things why most people choose blades over electric shavers: 1. quality of the shave and 2. skin irritation. <br />What I found using this Panasonic shaver the results are identical to regular blades. It shaves as close as regular blade. Not 80%, not 95%, it is exactly 100% as regular blades. And there is no skin irritation what's so ever! (at least for me). <br />What else can you ask from electric shaver? <br />
B000O5ED18|5|Really enjoy this product and so do all the gals to whom I gave it as a gift. I have tried several fragrances and like them all. It has really helped my dry skin. Got it as a white elephant at Bunco originally and I love it!
B000C21406|5|This is one of my all time favorite scents - but very hard to find. I just love the sandalwood scent base. Horizon is a very masculine earthy and woody scent that will not disappoint. Highly recommended.
B0066PFBES|5|I absulutly loved the hair It was great couldn't ask for better set matched my color just right thank you!
B0015KHMLE|4|good stuff, reliable, dependable. all anyone could expect from these batteries. Highly recommended. Fast, easy, profgessional, all very good stuff
B003CAO8EO|5|This face cream is wonderful. It is not oily and clearly nourishes the skin without making it greasy. I use it after I wash my face at night. It smells so good
B001FEKKIM|1|\\"cosmetic4less\\" is selling fake product, using the original product packaging.  This fake product doesn't work at all, smells bad, and is worth $0.  The \\"real\\" product works well and has a pleasant  smell.
B000BIVY24|5|The best thing ever
B004W2OQPC|5|It does what it suppose to!
B00416DEXE|5|This machine has a good working flow of low and high volts.one of the best I had and greatly works all around with my guns.my tattoo artist had this same one so I know it was good from the start.im glad I only paid $50. I hated it took 2 weeks to arrive whan it said it would be shipped earlier.
B009TZRQE0|5|Great item.  Great seller
B00D1XM1CI|5|Easy to use and keeps hair soft and manageable all day.
B000K67SW2|2|didn't work
B00YOHWTZY|5|Finally, a bath pillow I don't have to blow up.  They always disappoint.  This pillow is softly solid with support for both my head and my neck.  The suction cups are generously large.  Plus..bonus...a gel mask for while I'm soaking.  Doesn't get better than that.
B004CQ7S2G|2|It says pack of 2 and I only received 1.....
B00JOKVFRY|5|I took Roscara with me recently on holiday. I was so glad to have it! It soothed and cooled sunburn as well as a cooker burn, immediately relieved itch on athlete's foot, reduced swelling & itch on bites & provided an excellent in the sun facial moisturiser & after sun lotion. It was truly an all in one travel and first aid kit. Knowing that it is 100% natural & cruelty free really matters to me. Having had cancer I am very careful what I use on my body.  I work at Consultant level In NHS healthcare & have worked for 3 years in Dermatology research. I highly recommend this lotion!
B002BQ524A|5|i love the product... my hair is looking amazing and soft... 5 stars
B003BQ6QXK|5|It works! Just fill it with hot water like the instructions say and you have a fogless mirror.
B003EMXLIE|5|get it at costco, that is the best way to save money
B00JDNAUG4|4|Arrived a day late and the top to one of the jars was closed crooked so some spilled out. It's filled to the top so it wasn't a big deal. Only a little spilled out. You get a lot for the price though!
B000VQZHIS|5|This Kane not only looks elegant, but it is very sterdy. It's a good choice for folks who need a Kane.
B00ANTO72K|5|This brush was used on my at my hair salon, and I bought one immediately. The girls in my family have very fine hair that tangles just from sitting there. Especially the hair at the nape of the neck if you're wearing any kind of hood or collar. This brush gets through wet or dry hair amazingly. I gave one as a gift and she said &#34;This is a miracle! I don't know how I lived without this!&#34;
B00E4UDTXM|5|I am so happy bc this is my favorite color polish and it's been discontinued!!
B002UL10HO|4|This was not as dense as I would have liked for my purpose but may be a good brush overall for someone else for some other purpose.  I use mosly liquid foundation and this didn't work as well as I expected.  I ordered Sigma F82 to replace this one.
B001KYVMM0|4|Love it!
B000A3V1QO|1|I also agree that it's like scotch tape.  I tried several strips, peeling from multiple angles, and none of them worked.  Instead, I got a swelling eyelid the next day.  This product doesn't work at all.
B007NK17CK|5|I have been looking for a white-ish nail color and the stores always came up short with me. I love this shade. It's not bright white, but it doesn't look dirty or yellowish either. Of course, it being an OPI brand it dries and goes on well. Would definitely buy it again.
B00C7OLDLW|3|Very liquidy, but I didn't mind (should be easier to work through the hair, right?) Unfortunately, it didn't last long for I need a decent amount to work through my long hair.  As always, conditioner went way before the shampoo did.
B004IR6TY2|5|I am using this to hold my essential oils. I love it. Can see every item clearly. Thank you so much.
B00B1UAC10|5|Used this sponge for 2 weeks already to bath a newborn. Sponge is soft, non abrasive and holds water well.
B00028Q3UQ|5|Great eye makeup remover that you can fully trust that it won't make your eyes greasy and do anything harmful.  I've been using only this one for a long time.
B00LESGFGU|5|As advertised and well packaged.
B001A42R1A|5|I put a tablet in my mouth at bedtime and it keeps my mouth lubricated all night so I don't wake up.
B00A724L6K|4|The product is about what I expected. It clumps a lot but then the instructions are not in English and maybe I am doing it wrong.<br />Be patient when applying
B00CHMWAY8|5|very good product and delivery is OK
B002N5MHLK|2|I switched from Norelco expecting at least a better shave.  However, after almost two years, I have given up even pretending to like this shaver.  At first, it was continuous irritation and bleeding.  When I would take special care of one area, another area would be irritated or bleeding.  It took almost five months to become comfortable using this shaver and I had to use it wet in the shower with some form of lubricant (Fusion, Creamo) or the irritation returned.<br /><br />Also, after one year, the cleaning and charging station suddenly stopped working.  At that time, there were no replacements available.  I had also purchased one of these shavers for my adult son.  He uses it dry but waves the shaver over his face very fast and repeatedly.  He always has a red and irritated face afterwards but it does not seem to bother him.  His cleaning and charging station developed a bad case of mildew or mold that made the bathroom stink when the dryer fan ran.  We could never get it clean enough to stop growing the mold or mildew so he only uses it to charge the shaver.<br /><br />I replaced the inner blades once at six months and the full set after a little more than a year with no improvement either time.  In fact, the shave on my neck became horrible after the second replacement with long hairs being completely ignored.<br /><br />Then, to cap it all off, the display has now begun to show incorrect readings such as 4:88 for the time of the shave and battery life left at 28% after only one shave from a full recharge.  The only part of the display that I believe is the remaining battery bar chart.<br /><br />I will be moving on to another vender.
B0054MS97A|1|After using my ski. Itched a lot. Too drying. Also it did not lighten any of the skin, even from sun exposure after using dermabrasive gloves
B008H1IDKI|5|No joke, this makes your face really radiant! I use it fter sunscreen and before my Ready Bare Escentuals powder foundation and my face looks amazing. I will be using this forever :)<br />One little caveat. It doesn't last too long :(
B008U1Q4DI|5|I bought this for my daughter, she loves it, had tons of colors and shapes, she loves to decorate her nails.
B001T7JYAA|5|This is a beautiful eye shadow trio for a soft, subtle look. I really like how the color looks on me, but I was expecting it to show up more. Wetting it a little does help it to have a little darker tint. However, I am not a very dramatic person when it comes to eye shadow, so it really works out great for my taste. I am so impressed by the packaging...it arrived it perfect condition. I will definitely be buying more of this brand.
B003VMXOXO|5|This is a really nice summer color, orange but not neon orange kind of has a slight pink but definitely orange.
B000T5O87M|5|Purchased this product from my local Whole Foods. Was skeptical about the spray because it was a little pricey but decided to purchase anyway because I love the smell of it as well as it fits into my orgenic lifestyle change. I read some reviews and some complaints are having to reapply throughout the day. I walk 4 miles a day as well as have a very active lifestyle. I apply this deodorant once day at bedtime and it has worked for me. With other deodorant brand i have been using for a number of years by mid day I would have to reapply. I give it 5 stars because it works for me.
B0081CWUE8|3|Works well but a little to heavy for my hair
B00KSZ231G|4|love it im into big jewerly and this is awesome
B004UBC6VG|5|Love this! I love the smell and the fact that it doesn't flake!!
B001BPRXK8|4|I read review, after review, after review on sunless tanners for months before deciding on this one.  The Ocean Sunless Airbrush Tanning 8.5% Solution is the one I decided on after all of the research.  Basically, what I wanted was a spray tan in the convenience of my own home.  After reading the reviews, some people noted they purchased the GlowFusion Air Glow Air Gun to spray this product on their bodies, so I ordered that too.  It was a mess.  That gun sputtered out the Ocean solution all over, and I had to still rub it in.  So, I decided to just get a small 2 oz spray bottle to spray this solution on my body, then rub it in (always wearing gloves).  If I've got to rub it in anyway, I may as well use a spray bottle that is easier to control than the Air Glow Air Gun.  I am happy with the color the product gives me.  And it does not have a bad odor at all.  But it does peel off after a week or 2, it does not fade nicely.  What I need for this solution is something to mist it on my body, so I do not have to rub it in.  If anyone has any suggestions feel free to comment!
B00A7W13Q6|5|This is one of the best bronzes I have gotten in a long time! I will be buying it here again when needed
B003WR3QSG|5|First brush I have ever used.  Works great!
B001EWF346|5|Excellent product ....fast delivery:)
B004R7J2RO|5|I was able to give a few to a co- worker and she too enjoys the no slip grip Scunci. Scunci’s fit perfectly, with little to no discomfort. I would recommend this product in fact I did.
B001DKMY9Q|5|This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  After over forty years of various models of Braun shavers I switched to this shaver.  This Panasonic shaver is technologically superior to other shavers and is also less costly to operate and maintain.
B001JKTTVQ|4|I purchased two sets, this set had so much more.  Brushes with angles, great sizes, you will be pleased how these brushes can create a beauty.  IMHO.
B002KFCICG|5|At first I thought \\"6 dollars for shipping on these tiny items? What a ripoff!!!\\" When the package came I realized where my hard earned money when, the put these combs in a tiny box with a silk bag and fairy dust, its a wonderful surprise. Worth every penny.
B0002DNABG|5|When I couldn't find this fragrance in the store anymore, I thought I would die! Before my husband started wearing it, I liked him...a lot. After the first application, I was in love (Ha Ha). This is a smooth, fresh, clean yet sexy fragrance. Not too spicy or floral. It doesn't smell like pine trees either. It's \\"JUST RIGHT\\".  It's for that good-looking, well dressed, suit or jeans, want-to-get-close-to kind of guy. Never too strong. You won't be disappointed, I promise!
B00DLN5RQA|2|Did not live up to the hipe.  Wore off during yard work.  Washed off with Eucerin Redness Relief Cleanser, so I did not have to use the special cleanser - so that was wasted money.<br /><br />The effort and patience required to learn and to apply this product are not worth it.  It did not last three days and did not stand up to sweat and toweling during yard work.
B0002Z8P8W|5|I love this conditioner so much, I want to marry it. My hair is pretty heavily highlighted, and as a result, it's becoming straw-like and fried-looking and generally unattractive. I ordered this stuff based on reviews on Makeup Alley, and holy cow, it doesn't disappoint. It's pretty heavy, so maybe not best use for every day. That said, I have very thin, fine hair, and I use it every day with no problems. Just use a clarifying shampoo every once in awhile to avoid build-up. This stuff is the bomb-diggity.
B0073W9IOC|5|This coconut oil goes on smooth; however, you have to make sure it is in temperature over 76 degrees or it will definitely melt as it says on the bottle. However it moisturized my body and my face very well. My skin felt and look better.  I will order this product again and from this company. Good customer service delivery!
B00HNSSPDG|4|Excellent.
B000JW2IO0|5|A must get. It leaves your hands soft and the scent is light, not over powering<br />I will get it again.
B00KYU4POS|5|Bought a couple for gifts.  The colors were perfect.
B009E0RO7O|5|I got this to help organize the clutter in my handbag/diaper bag. You won't find anything better for the price! I'll keep buying these to keep me organized around the house too.
B000ZK18OW|5|Absolutely love this product.  It cleans, disinfects, and keeps my piercings well managed.  Never have to worry about infections when I use this product.
B005FA7FQC|2|Cleansing water is a French concept, to be used when you don't have access to water to clean your face. Sounds more like a good traveling product, but the bottle itself is not good for traveling. I bought this after the facialist at a Lierac place recommended this product. I have been using it for a few months. It is a decent product in that it makes my skin clean, but I don't understand what it does for my face that water doesn't. I use this in the evenings sometimes after washing my face with water, then let it dry and use Lierac hydrating balm. It stings a little when I use the balm after this water. The results are the same when I use regular water. In addition, this is touted as a product good for removing makeup. It did a very bad job of removing my eyeliner. I had to use my usual Kiehl's lotion to remove the remaining eye makeup. I don't recommend this product, it does pretty much the same work as water.<br /><br />Also this product says to apply with a cotton pad. A long time back when I was suffering from acne in my teenage years, the product I used recommended applying with a cotton pad. I did that religiously, unfortunately the company stopped manufacturing that product and I ran out of it soon due to using it with cotton pads. My skin specialist was surprised and said that given that I have a marketing background, how could I not see that this was just a gimmick to get customers to use more product and buy more? So I apply this product with my hands and it works fine, not sure what a cotton pad can do that my hands cannot.
B00J9SNKXI|5|Love this product!! It is so nice to have everything you need in one product. I used to use multiple products to get the same results, so much easier. The bottle last a long time, you do not have to use that much of it so it goes along way
B003AYEFU4|4|Scrunch spray is miraculous! It has helped make my crazy-thick, frizzy, wavy/curly long hair. I use it after showering, as a I feel I get a more even distribution that way. Not to mention my hair is unmanageable once it's dry. My super frizzy, unmanageable hair becomes fabulously curly with just Sprunch apray. You do have to be careful to not use too much, otherwise your hair will look unnatural and will be clumped together in thick chunks. Too little does almost no good. Find your happy medium and you will be pleasantly surprised!
B000OP3R74|4|Great chemical free deodorant. It smells great. The only reason it gets 4 stars is that it doesn't last throughout the day, but frankly speaking I haven't found another one that does too. .... Until then I will stay with this one!
B0017LAG8M|4|work great nice for cleaning the dogs teeth also works great on my teeth only problem toothpaste seems to stick inside the brush so you have to make double sure to rinse them off good that's why the 4 stars
B00L9ILA42|5|smells amazing, good lather, and a beautiful bottle! (even better in real life ;)<br />love love love.
B00292BRTU|4|Very nice package of items. Very complete. The plastic housings on the trimmers isn't very sturdy, it will get broken with use, I remember my dad had a Wahl trimmer (mom still has the trimmer in a cabinet and it still works) 40 years ago and the plastic it is made from is quality stuff. This is like a childs cheap toy in quality of plastic. That said... it works great, as well as my dads old one ever did, just wished the plastic was quality. I did my own hair cut with it in 30 minutes from 10 inches of hair down to a nice military style with little difficulty. THe guides work like a charm. Started with a 7 to see what happened, went to a 4 sort of in between and ended with a 2, which is what I wanted. The tapered ear trimmer guides are great and work well. Had to do a little scissor trim around the ears to finish up. Used the eye brow trimmer and it was nice and easy. I will never pay for another haircut as long as I live, providing this doesn't burn out or crack apart.<br /><br />Pros: Guides are heavy and do not flex when used, yet are not painfull to use<br />  tapered ear trimmers fantastic<br />  eye brow attachment excellent<br />  flexible mini trimmer with rotating head<br />  middle sized trimmer great for neck and side burns<br />cons: The plastic housing on the trimmers is very cheap<br />  the battery holder on the micro trimmer is difficult to align batteries into<br />  the velcro that is on the cape has a glue that never dries, it is all sticky and oily and is best to just throw out.
B002B9FWLK|5|Very powerful dryer in a small package. Noisy but works great
B005X8H7ZK|4|Love this product! No longer do I worry about beard dandruff.  Keeps my beard soft as well.  Only need to use a little bit so 8oz actually lasts longer than I thought it would.<br /><br />Note: I am not a bearded woman but I assume it would work just as well on a woman with a beard.  Nowhere on the bottle did I see anything saying for men only so that's pretty cool.
B00BOJRGGM|5|A
B008ACZHM6|5|Makes your hands feel great all day
B000FQ5NNI|5|We are all addicted to the BrushPicks and to have them in this convenient case is great. I just snapped it directly on my keychain and now I always have a BrushPick available when I'm in the car or out and about. This product is great for a quick floss on the go.
B00F36SS4G|1|Terrible quality! Didnt eve come out from the paper!!
B0009DT39C|5|Good product.  I like it.
B000NPWQU4|3|This is ok for the price but after it soaks in it stinks. I like how it slowly creates color but not happy about the smell.
B00IDWP4IA|5|I have used other Vitamin C Serums, but this one works wonderfully! Visible difference within one week!
B001VE0QA8|5|Great.
B0017OLP5W|5|We have eight people in our household and these are great to keep the toothbrushes clean and organized. Plus they are very easy to take apart and clean. I get compliments on them all the time.
B008DG776S|5|I have super fine hair which has never been able to hold a curl longer than an hour with any traditional curling iron. I can now do my hair in under 10 mins and it lasts all day. I've never been able to do my hair in the past but now I feel like a pro. Definitely cheaper and easier if you consider the cost and time spent at a salon.
B003V265QW|5|Love it! Just need to be careful not to burn yourself!
B0009OAFU2|5|Nice product. I have owned a previous model before this and really liked it. This one is similar in function and performance and hence gets full marks. The only thing they could have improved was ergonomics.
B006TM2NEO|5|This lets you keep your UV sensitive gel brush protected completely from light while not in use. Brilliant! I've had it for a month now and love it.
B000NL0T1G|5|This is my favorite razor in fifty years! I should have been using this and single blades all along. Been late then never.
B00RDN9I3M|5|Perfection!  Will buy again!  I got the sensitive and also the deep pore cleansing.  At this price I thought why not?  Both are great!  YOu will not regret this purchase.
B0041PMZCG|5|I love this stuff, esp. after the product that I used from another company was discontinued.  Even better, this is a cruelty free product.  The hold is great and you don't need to use much at all, less than a dime sized amount.  Great!
B002XITZJ4|5|Everything was perfect. The packaging was perfect. And the smell's great.<br />My girlfriend was hoping to get it for some time and I bought this for her as a birthday gift.<br /><br />She absolutely loved it.
B001HBHLGC|5|AWESOME VALUE

B001CX4JSS|2|Prior to purchasing this toothbrush, I had the cheap Crest spinbrush that I bought for about $10 from walgreens, which had the 'dual' action in one head. But of course for $10 it eventually died on me and I figured if I'm going to buy another electric toothbrush, I'll go for one that's worth it and from a top brand. Unfortunately, this pulsonic wasn't it...even after the $20 rebate I was able to get. I had high expectations for this thing and it turned out to be a complete disappointment.<br />  To sum, all this toothbrush is is a standard toothbrush with extra vibrating power. I found myself brushing my teeth as I would with a manual $1 toothbrush, except it wasn't $1! The head does not move, the complete body of the toothbrush simply has this vibration that when you put it against your teeth, it does nothing but hum slightly. It doesn't even give me that clean glossy feel like the Crest spinbrush did.<br /> I was pretty excited ordering an electric toothbrush that'll finally make my dentist proud :P, and get the job done! I had been looking over some reviews for a while before purchasing this ..and i was debating with myself between this one and another oral b toothbrush that just had the spinhead, which I wish I should have ordered instead. I chose this because it came with the precision tip head (which does not do much either). But now I honestly feel like I wasted $30, and I'm forcing myself to continue using it to get my money's worth!<br />In all, if you're going to buy an oral b brush, get the one that has the spin head only. This brush is the equivalent of a standard manual brush that you have to put work into, instead of it doing the work for you.
B00EOB0042|5|Haven't used it for long yet, but so far so good.  Seems to completely prevent odor.  Not a good choice for people who have to have an absolutely clear deodorant or insist on using an antiperspirant, but great for those of us who prefer a natural choice without aluminum or the other stuff that might have a harmful effect on the body.  I also bought this for my very active pre-teen, for whom I definitely want something natural, and it's working well for her.
B000M4CNI6|5|My first one fell apart after more than 10 years, This one is a little smaller than my first. Oh well
B000C1UEGC|3|LOL, I was hoping for a different kind to attraction, but it is not a bad fragrance.
B00FJPJ084|3|Not sure because I have not used it long enough to see results.
B000WUL60Q|5|This is the best product I have come across for fine, thin hair. It helps gain control, maintain color, and creates extreme shine.  I use it with the Brocotto Hold On product to provide extra staying power.  This product makes my hair fuller. It returns to its place even in windy conditions and allows it to have motion. This is my very favorite product. It only takes a tiny amount.  I use just enough to cover the end of my finger nail (the French Manicured part.) So, a little goes a long way. It's a solution for fine limp or dry hair.
B0074G7U6A|5|And it is discontinued.  Too bad.
B003XJZJCE|5|LOVE this leave in! works great and is light, adds no weight
B00FM9FCLQ|2|Didn't pay attention to the size of this bottle, which looks MUCH LARGER in the photo. In actuality, it's about the size of a thumb. That small. At $50, I expected it to be a tad bit bigger, maybe the size of a middle finger?! As for the product itself, it's milky and smells faintly of rose. Faintly. Does my hair feel silky smooth. Not really. Sadly disappointed.
B00NYIP6P4|5|I love that all items are in pockets and sponge and bar soap are in center. It is easy to grab and use items.
B00CJ3MDJW|5|Love it beautiful the best
B00B72L9JQ|5|I have been using the Marine Cream for several years and love it but wanted to try the Night Cream.  The Marine Cream It is very light, not greasy at all and a little goes a long way.  The Night Cream is much heavier and doesn't spread quite so easily or as far.  I used up all of the Night Cream but still have half of the Marine Cream left.  Overall I consider this a good deal and might buy again.
B000HP7IJY|5|I received this product within 4 days and it is better than I thought. I love how it makes you feel so clean without any soapy filmy feel to your skin. Try it. You'll love it.
B003Z4QHP0|4|I do love this product but it did have a tendency on drying out certain areas of my face. It did calm my acne as well give my skin a healthy glow.
B0015DIF58|5|I cannot believe this product is off the market. It is almost worth every penny. The sender came through and I and my 7 year old daughter are grateful.
B00NZB3MAQ|4|I love it
B00GF1NZLY|5|Tea Tree Oil is an essential at my house. I first tried it several years ago, and loved the many benefits it provided my home and family.  I haven't found a brand I prefer over any other-until now!  I had the opportunity to review Apothecary Extracts 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil for the past few weeks, and it is now my favorite brand.<br />There are SO MANY uses for Tea Tree Oil, both personal and household use.  Some personal use examples are: fighting acne, dandruff and warts.  Household use includes making your own detergents and cleaners, or shampoo and body wash.  I use Tea Tree Oil for many things, but probably my biggest use of it is in household cleaners and detergents.  It worked great on my kids' acne when they were teens too!<br /><br /> Tea Tree Oil is a powerful essential oil known to be an immune stimulant.  It can fight all three categories of infectious organisms.  When someone in my home is coming down with a flu/cold, Tea Tree Oil vaporized can knock it out quickly.<br /><br /> Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is a pure oil taken from the Melaluca tree native to Australia.  Many essential oils are diluted, but this is pure, high quality Tea Tree Oil.
B000U0F9GA|5|Better than expected!
B00BQMIGTI|5|Great colors and size!
B0066SKPBY|5|This is a very good white color. I've only used it once for polka dots, but it was definitely a bright white that came through very well. I imagine I'd still have to use two coats as a normal polish.
B00T52QSOQ|5|LOVE. I have really sensitive skin, wanted something that was all natural. This product came fast, and with 2 extra travel size towelettes :) Very nice! Removes makeup like a charm, eyeliner and everything comes off easily. Will be purchasing again.
B001CB5OE8|5|[[ASIN:B001CB5OE8 Renew Lash Brand New Factory Fresh]] Buy it, you won't be sorry!  My daughter, who is a cosmetologist, turned me on to this product.  This manufacturer has pulled out the ingredient in glaucoma medication which causes the eyelashes to grow, (ask anyone who has glaucoma about how incredible their eyelashes have gotten since they started using their medication!) and formulated Renew Lash. There are other products with a similar name, this product is by Metics.  Make sure you get the right one!  I have been using it for about 6 months and it is unbelievable.  My eyelashes are naturally short and straight.  They now hit almost to my eyebrows!  You will notice some irritation for the first 4-5 days of use, but it will go away after that.  I found that using eye drops during this period helped a lot.  You apply it like eyeliner just to your upper lash line at night.  It doesn't take much.  You will start to see a difference in about 3 weeks.  As the weeks go by you will not believe it.  It's amazing. I have people ask me if I have lash extensions all the time, and I have never had anybody say anything about my eyelashes in my entire life ,and I am 45!  I tell anybody who will listen about this product, it's that good.  I was really skeptical at first but after my daughter started using it I was sold.  Your lashes will keep growing until they actually get too heavy for the follicle and then they will drop, being replaced by a new one.  I will definitely be using this forever!  And, the Amazon price of $62.00 can't be beat, even with the shipping!  My daughter got mine using her cosmetologists discount and it was still $85.00!  This retails between $140-160! Because you don't use much, it lasts a long time.  I would definitely buy it at this price, it is the best I have seen.  Try it, you won't be sorry.  I know several people who are using this and they all are having the same results as I have!
B003B3OKQ8|5|Love this product.  I always come back to these. these are the best. Gives a fresh feeling mouth, and no gum irritation after prolonged use of this product. highly recommend.
B001G7PPNI|3|So i bought this thinking i could have a nice dark little tan without going in the sun. I followed all the reviewers instructions.<br />I'm half Mexican and half white, so i have a natural tan.<br />I've applied this 4 full times and an extra time on my legs.<br />I see a semi-noticeable tan. that's it. so much for deep dark.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't smell too bad, only when its developing. It didn't streak, looks even. it's not orange-y.<br />BUT the guide color was non-existent, maybe cause I'm dark.<br />and the color wasn't as deep as i was looking for.<br />For all the effort, i could have stood in the sun for the the amount of time i took to apply and dry, and came out way darker.
B0086LC0WG|5|When I received my items I try them out an so far I love them yall r alsome ty, I would ref. My family an friends too yall
B00CNUUKIC|4|Great after peels,smells like cinnamon rolls, softness skin, no silicone,thick, and fast absorbing, gets rid of dry spots, but the one downside is I think it breaks me out.
B00B2IFY2S|5|I love these stencils they work like u just went to the nail salon great buy cheaper to do ur own nails at home plus u get pretty good doing it on ur own
B00GOYTX90|5|We have had this for months and use it daily. It works perfect everytime.
B00I32AN4K|5|Smells wonderful and more importantly, it freaking works! Hooray for awesome hair dasy, every day.
B004ZGAOCE|5|I love the AcneFree line! I wish this scrub was a little more &#34;gritty&#34; but it says gentle so I suppose that's why it's not. Still, my face is clear so I guess it's doing it's job.
B001886K48|3|If you are thinking of purchasing this item, perhaps you should reconsider.  I bought this going against other reviews, but I must admit it was a mistake.  this product is cute and the pouch makes it a good purchase, but the contents does not.  I purchased this shaver last night and immediately opened it because I was excited to find a cute shaver with all of the different attachments.  I tried them all and the only attachment that worked satisfactorily was the trimmer.  The different comb guards are really bulky and you cannot get a precise cut, though they have different numbers.  It just doesn't work out.  The mini shaver is just what it says a mini shaver that doesn't mini{mal}.  I had no success with the shaver, big dissappointment and therefore, I am returning the product today.  As for the eyebrow, I did not try this, because I purchased this product because of the shaver, not to mention that it was $27 in the store.  If I were you, I would really reconsider.
B00GWBR5N6|1|Too difficult to use, gives me a headache trying to suck my lips in so much. The seller was extremely kind in giving me all of them to try, unfortunately I just don't care for how to do it. Maybe I just have lazy lips.
B004E6URV8|5|This is going to be a Christmas gift - but I like the smell when I've seen it in a store!
B001CC1VV2|3|Meh.
B0045WBFAI|5|This is the best. I worked in a salon for years and have tried every product out there. I was using moroccan oil which is great but expensive when a saleswoman for alterna gave me a sample and i was hooked. I use this oil and my mom uses the spray because she has finer hair. Is really works great and smells good too.
B002XITZ1W|4|This normally sells for $75 in the department stores.  I was a bit concerned at first but the scent is true as I have a bit left over that I bought from a department store.  The scent also stays with you for a while.  I was a bit concerned it might just be colored water due to the price.  WIll purchase again for sure.
B000FW2NIU|5|This stuff is great! Definitely works to keep hair away longer!
B00SNS13QQ|5|great value ! wonderful set for begining makeup artist!
B0075P0WW4|5|just brought one and the foil ripped and rather replace the whole thing just replaced foil and works just fine now
B000E7STGQ|5|I was introduced to Tommy Bahama a while back and had never smelled anything quite like it.  It's unique and has an earthy feel.  So even though I really don't care for the name, I think I've found my cologne.
B00ISADRHM|5|Liked it
B0006LNKYG|5|Love this shade of red! Definitely a favorite!
B000GCZZZC|5|Great product!
B005LFR0XO|5|Love this toothbrush for traveling!  I bought one for myself, a one for each of my friends!  Great gift!
B0009OMU0A|1|I liked the features of the shaver, and would have given it 5 stars if I'd reviewed it in the first few months I owned it. After about a year, I got fewer and fewer shaves with each charge of the battery. About 18 months after I bought it, it would hold a charge for only one shave. After two years, it wouldn't hold a charge at all. And it won't run on AC power, so it now awaits recycling. If the manufacturer had made some provision for replacing the battery, I wouldn't have minded this so much. But they didn't, so I'm giving this a 1-star rating.
B003BOLJY8|2|It says it fits all T3 hairdryers, but it does not!  I am trying to exchange it for one that fits.  The product itself is better than the original one, but won't work if doesnt' fit my dryer.
B00PV15BPW|4|Great stuff.  Unfortunately, the dropper was made of glass and was not packed will, so it broke.  However, the oil still works.
B009LLDAK6|5|Perfect and perfect price!
B0026IFLH6|5|This product is great.  The best price for a good size bottle. I like the smell and my husband uses it also.  I do recommend suave as I have used this product for years.
B007I2GQA6|5|I will be ordering more of this soap, it lathers up really good but best of all my skin just feels cleaner when using it.
B003JJYT92|5|It went beyond my expectations.
B002VECKKG|1|REALLY? You really want to send someone a product with an opened seal and a fingerprint inside as well?!F*** YOU.
B000F4USF8|1|If you want to spend all day going over the same spot you'll love this piece of crap.
B003K2IF4I|4|I really like the moisturizing power of this product.  I especially like that it's quick-absorbing and not oily or greasy.  Over the years, I've used many products such as this, and this is the best non-oily/non-greasy one I've found yet.
B001P8OOSK|5|This product helped strengthen my nails after I had done a LOT of gardening.  I will continue to use it!
B00H59C1C4|5|Very gentle - and you'll see results the first time you use it - because this refining tonic does such a good job clarifying your skin! After a few weeks, the change is even more remarkable.
B00F2RAXA8|4|It was great for the money!  It was used as a crown for the prom queen and it did the trick.  I would recommend buying it as long as your expectations are set for this price range.
B007P7XUQ2|3|I grew up in the 80's with big bangs and with Lee Press on nails that would flick off without so much as a sneeze. The press on nail has evolved into something actually wearable!  These stayed on for about 4 days and I'm pretty hard on my hands and undergo constant hand washings. I think four days of nice nails is pretty decent. People with desk jobs might find them last even longer. I'm guessing that you can baby them for a week. They look nice, not dramatically long (i.e. cheap), they're demurely short, a classy length. People commented on my nice manicure without suspecting is just glued them on. Fun.
B004K1AS8O|5|I am very happy with this product and will continue to use until I have cataract surgery next year.
B001DNE3KQ|5|A superb shaver and trimmer. Well worth the cost. The charge lasts a long time and I like the display in the handle that shows the percentage of charge remaining and the percentage of charge attained when it is attached to the charger.
B0094GHL62|5|Great mascara
B003IXFGGE|4|Wonderful product
B006WOBIZE|5|too bad it doesn't come in a packet of spray, lotion, and oil. if it did you know I will buy that asap
B0075X0Z46|4|Works pretty well, and being able to rinse it in water is great.
B00LALMG3W|5|Great Stuff!  So moisturizing and leaves skin so soft. !  I don't know how I lived without it !
B00LEA538E|4|Good for short hair....tangles in long hair.  Makes very shinny
B000VT54QA|5|Quality item that appears it will hold up well and not break like others I have used.
B0010H687Q|2|I didn't see much of a difference. I will be sticking with my crest white strips.
B0012V856W|5|Nothing like the European made Nivea. This is the best of their products next to their moisturising cream. Many thanks!
B004YD73T0|5|ve ry fa st sh ip pi ng. lo ve the pro duct sorry. gotta fit it all. stupid comments.
B00V4J3UGW|5|This was easy to apply and was light weight. It gave me the natural look I was hoping for and stayed on for hours. Lip gloss was a bit bright for my taste, but fun to try out anyway.
B004C432FK|5|I have used Philosophy products for years and this go-to cream works wonders. I have combo skin, but have started to be concerned about aging. The weight is light enough not to clog pores, yet keeps my drier areas feeling soft. I can use daya and night. This size is an excellent deal!
B005XIDZHO|1|Waste of time and money. Does nothing. I tried it multiple times. It was literally like throwing money away. Dont order.
B00BOMP1AM|5|LUV THIS POLISH LOOKS AWESOME LASTS A LONG TIME & IM ALWAYS GETTING COMPLIMENTS ON HOW KOOLMY NAILS LOOK BY ALL KINDS OF PPL =)'
B001F51Q8Y|2|This Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint is very much like the Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection except for a few of the chemical ingredients are re-ordered, and the flavor.  While the Gum Protection is fiercely minty, the Clean Mint is mild enough that my son doesn't mind the flavor.<br /><br />Back to Chemicals -- one difference is that the order of Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Sulfate in the list of ingredients is reversed.  There are other switches, but given that they are way low on the list I doubt it makes a significant difference in effectiveness.<br /><br />We won't be buying more of this because the many 1-Star reviews seem to indicate that there is a quality control problem with this particular product.
B00DSYFYSS|4|It made my acene disappear BUT I hate that it dries up my face. The bottle says use it 3 times a day and I am not going to do that I'm going to use it once one week or two. It makes my face itchy :c but it's worth it
B0037TM252|4|Good stuff, you really see results after a couple months, highly recommended.
B000F0GNT2|5|I absolutely love this product. It came with two sponge pads (one for face, one for body), a bristle brush, a bottle of microdermabrasion, two batteries, and cleaner for the sponges. It was completely ready for use the minute I took it out of the package. There are 2 settings, one that lets it run for 2 minutes, the other runs until you turn it off. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin tone (more evenness in color) and it has definitely minimized my pores. My face is smooth and feels refreshed after using this product. I highly recommend it.
B0047AB5R6|5|I love this brush!  The handle is weighty and nicely balanced as well as comfortable.  I've read other reviews that mentioned initial bristle loss, but that has not been my experience.  I highly recommend this brush!
B00GOYIE90|5|As expected
B003EMHV1C|3|While I love the clinical strength line, I need to change up my antiperspirant I previously was buying the all day fresh scent (the waterproof one) of this product. I found it worked very well at first, but as with all antiperspirants, eventually they start to lose their effectiveness, which I read an article about today that it's not just in my head. So I decided to change it up slightly and try a different variation of the kind of like, big mistake. I realize now that they call this a woodsy scent, which is in fact musty and reminds me of old spice or other types of men's deodorant. I would recommend this product but not this scent.
B006UET4XE|5|I use several different brands of cosmetics, but Maybelline's eye liners are my favorite.  Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner draws a smooth, bold line that dries quickly, doesn't smear or flake and gives your eyes that WOW factor seen on runway models.  Highly recommend.
B000KHVH8W|5|This company makes the best scented diffusers out there.  The scents are not overwhelmingly perfumed like most other diffusers.  This scent, Noel, is so subtle and pure, I can walk in my home 9 months after I purchased it and still smell it! It smells like a fraiser fir fresh fresh cut tree!
B0053L2E1O|1|I tend to like toiletries that are natural and not really fragranced to smell like cologne or perfume, so the nutty burnt ash/nutty scent of this was perfect.  And initially, I felt squeaky clean (which should've been my first indication that this product was completely stripping all moisture from my skin).<br /><br />This product was way too harsh.  I'm a black guy who doesn't have a bathroom full of product.  I eat right, drink loads of water and already have dark, smooth, radiant, blemish-free skin.  However after using this soap for a few weeks, my skin dried out excessively to the point that it had scale-like patches and started over-producing sebum which then caused major breakouts.  Not even moisturizing afterward helped.<br /><br />I discontinued use a month ago, and went back to my bars of Dr. Bonner's along with moisturizing after a shower with coconut oil and now my skin is back to its former glory.<br /><br />I wanted to like this product, but it was a hot mess.  At least for me.  If I could return the remaining, unopened packs for a refund, I most certainly would!
B008U5RUW8|5|I really like this product.  It takes very little.  Gives real shine and control.
B00HAAQ0Y8|1|This product has been completely ineffective for me over the 60 days I have used it.........and I purchased a 90 day supply.  My experience is this product was a waste of money.
B00CPR82HO|4|was please with my purhase . Now my nails are growing  without breaking or chiping.
B0086VIA0M|5|I use these all the time and replace the heads every 3 months as recommended. Highly recommend.
B001H9NCGC|1|My experience with this product was that it was very irritating to my gums and mouth.  It took me a couple of days to connect the discomfort in my mouth with this toothpaste, but as soon as I stopped using it, my mouth went back to normal.  I shared this experience with a friend and she said she had the same experience with the same toothpaste.  I can't explain why, but perhaps some people are sensitive to either the baking soda or the peroxide or both.  Just something I thought needed to be shared.
B0082H27EK|4|I have oily skin and have been trying out different natural moisturizers for a few years.  I do a lot of research to avoid chemicals, I am going to stick with this product.
B002B4EF9U|3|When it comes to the seller, the product was shipped on time and was received in a timely fashion. The product is not so great itself (which has nothing to do with the seller, but with ELF). For being the color 'dark', it is actually fairly light. The application brush isn't the greatest and it usually has too much product on it. For the other side of this product, 'treat', I think it works great. I've been applying it to my brows at night and I have noticed hair re-growth.
B00005NAOD|5|Excellent product for the price. I initially thought it was a little greasy but now realize it just takes about thirty minutes for my skin to really absorb it. My face feels soft and looks quite radiant after about one week of use.
B00MM8C0BA|5|LOVE!!!
B007ROD09K|4|I have a part-time esthetics practice (I do anywhere from 2-8 facials in a typical  week) and I rent one room in a salon. My previous towel cabby could only hold 6 hand towels and that was if I really crammed them in. This one easily holds 12 so I can set up for several facials at a time, which I love! It heats up very quickly, so it's helpful if I have a walk-in wanting an express facial.<br /><br />My only complaint is the strong smell - I've been using it for about a month and it's just starting to go away. I hated having that smell in my hot towels so strongly the first week - I cleaned it multiple times but it really just had to burn off I guess.
B00MJ71204|1|I really wanted to believe, since I know that presented product may vary in quality, same product can be ordered few times and you can get few different quality products, since its not always the same seller, no matter this is honeywin's page.<br /><br />My product arrived today and it looks NOTHING like the picture.<br />It is thin, very dark, half the size like it is on the picture, and it is not as thick in hair like presented here.<br />It is EXTREMELY poor quality.<br />I touched it to feel it after unpacking and literally dosens of hair fell off.<br />It is very fragile, I cannot see myself wearing this more then once. Its like one time use.
B004KKIB5M|5|it really helps with oil control! I would have my makeup on for 7-8 hours a day and it really keeps it on!
B004O9FBCK|5|Great product!
B001M5DC5C|5|Love this fresh scent for every day use. I even use it for my kids (1 and 3 years old). It lasts a lot.
B00WZX5A8M|3|After looking long and hard for a bag to fit my needs, I'm still left disappointed with this bag.<br />I give it 3 stars for its looks. Don't be deceived by how big and roomy it looks online. I went into a local Ulta to check it out in person, and still decided to take it home to give it a try.<br />I thought the two sides would be perfect for hair products on one side and makeup/skincare on the other. This bag will work out just fine if you plan on only packing travel size products. I like to pack what I use at home, so if you do too, this is not for you.<br />I wish Caboodle would make the same model, but bigger and possibly out of a lighter/more durable fabric (no pleather).
B00JZZMAAY|2|I got an allergic reaction. My eyes got red, my lips got super red, fever, and headache. Take the pill after a consideration. I couldnt even have sex after taking this pill...
B0002FCBRS|5|I love the smell of the Suave Emerald Fresh soap. My local Walmart stocked it for a while  then stopped. When it returned I bought a case( ALOT of soap) I continued to buy while I could find it now I have used my last bar & can't find it in my area.  Smell is so fresh & clean. WONDERFUL.  AMAZON I was counting on you to have it!
B0073P01RC|5|I love this product.  I have sensitive skin but had no problems using this product.  The skin-tone color is a perfect match and makes your complexion look soft and velvety.  I will use this product as long as it is available.  Love it!
B004QM0OJ0|5|I suffer from dry mouth so I bought a 3 pack of these lozenges.  I keep one in the car, one at work and one at home.  They taste really good and definitely get the mouth watering.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.
B000V8MTIC|3|UPDATING MY PRIOR REVIEW:  I used this product for a couple of months and it didn't do anything.  Doesn't mean it doesn't work.  It just didn't work for me :(      As with another reviewer, I am not sure if this product will work because I just bought it today and today was the first time I used it.  However, through no fault but my own, I damaged my hair with an outdated and possibly too strong of a relaxer.  As a result, my hair fell out around the edges and at the crown.  I have been using various products for nearly a year now and it has grown back some except for the crown area.  Therefore, if this product gets my hair growing in this area, I will consider it a success.  My hair doesn't grow very fast, so I am willing to wait a month to see if there's any new growth.  I will update my review to let you know.    Also, as with other reviewers, the smell is a bit daunting, but it's not horrific.  It does take getting used to; however, as stated previously, if it grows my hair, then I can deal :).  In the meantime, I bought one of those waterless shampoos as well as a hair/body mist (Jonathan has one) that I sprayed on my hair to neutralize the smell.  It works!  Some of you might want to give it a try ;).    Also, as with another reviewer, it is best to buy it at Sally's.  It's cheaper there, though there aren't many on the shelves.  It appears to be selling very quickly.
B002VECIJ4|2|seems old it is too thick
B000W405SG|1|Never worked right. If I leave the battery in it drains it completely. Quit working a few months after purchase. Do not buy. Would give zero stars for a rating.
B0009WMENU|5|I love Murad products.  This is my go to moisturizer...I love the way it smells, feels and it goes on like silk.  There is a tiny shimmer to it too, if you like that kind of thing.  I use many Murad products and I have many faves, this is one of them!
B007IVYL18|5|this cream is the bomb.com! Works well. u dont have to use alot, twists look greaqt and it smeels good too!
B001CSZTFK|5|I wish that Oral-B still made this toothbrush. It's the best that I've ever used. Cleans my teeth very well.
B001H926PA|5|This was one of the only products i found that didn't cake or make you look fake and plastic. It matches with your natural complexion and covers all zits, pimples, or anything red and noticeable. The shipping was also on time and packaged very nicely.
B00B0F3NO4|2|Looks too &#34;yellow.&#34;
B005OSQGN8|5|I am very pleased with the LED shower mirror. I use it daily in my large open shower and I don't even have to fill it with water to prevent fogging. The razor shelf is a nice feature. It would be nice if the LEDs had an auto off function. Highly recommend.
B000L82C52|5|I love that this product helped my tattoo heal really well and kepts it looking new. It helps alot with the itching as the skin heals.
B000REO5JQ|5|Love it. My skin is clearly smoother and softened. I got it on sale in a supermarket for $5. It is better than the EL cleanser I got for about $20.
B00BXJVV6E|5|I luvvv the ladygroomer!  This little trimmer is great for the bikini area and doesn’t cause any ingrown hairs like my previous razor.  I sometimes use it to touch up my eyebrows between waxes.<br /><br />Highly recommend to my girly friends!!
B009QUCL9I|5|good
B00GOJMIWO|4|Soft and gentle. Worked as promised.
B000BUUVTE|4|One of the best razors I have used, and a lot cheaper than retail stores.
B000Z5Y2XQ|5|This is a lightweight, silky moisturizer that does not leave you greasy. I have noticed improvement in the skin... less wrinkles, less breakouts and not as dry.
B00FEMO2I0|4|I love the eye and forehead patches but the smaller odd pieces weren't very helpful to me.
B00CFWXAZI|5|I bought this product and it even come with a little bottle of powder extra and the bigger bottle that i ordered and it smells very nice and it shipped on time i would definitely recommend this product
B001CSZTFK|5|I could not find the replacement brushes for my Oral-B sonic brush anywhere. Found this listing on Amazon and ordered. They were a perfect fit and now I can continue to enjoy my Oral-B with new brushes.
B0051S8X8W|5|This product met and exceeded my expectations. It's actually pretty long for an 18\\" (it goes down past my breasts). The color is spot on and after a few washes it's still soft and tangle free. I definitely recommend this product, paying for higher quality will make up for itself in the long run.
B00KHYHKIO|1|gets caught in hair
B003709CUE|5|My head was itching itensely and I had bald spots forming on the front and back of my head prior to using this product. My doctor assumed it was stress induced, but was unsure exactly what the cause was. I have been using this product for 1.5 months, and the itch is GONE. Not only is the itch gone, but my hair is growing back, and does not get as greasy as it once did. I can't remember the last time my scalp felt this great. I am so glad I tried this product, because it has helped me tremendously.
B00QR6SS6O|5|i am super impressed with with my lemon oil! i added it to a reed diffuser in my bedroom and every time i walk in i am given the pleasure of a nice bright and clean lemon scent! i love waking to the invigorating scent as well! this is a large 4 ounce bottle so i am really happy i can refill my diffuser many times, what a great bargain! i highly recommend majestic pure lemon oil essential oils!
B00NTCOSTA|5|This is the perfect gift for my mom who loves to pamper herself.  She has fantastic skin for 82 years old.  I know she will get plenty of use out of them.
B003F17EFA|5|It really held my style as I wanted it to.
B000VON4NK|5|I've been a fan of this perfume for years.  Once Sephora stopped stocking it, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
B005PY43JA|5|We can't find these in Costco anymore so we were thrilled to find them here.  Just what my husband expected.  Great fit, great quality.
B000MAOWP2|5|You can read my review of the Mychelle Clear Skin Serum. Mychelle Vitamin C Serum works great, I don't think the rest of the Mychelle oily/acne products work as well in clearing up skin as it does when it's coupled with Vitamin C Serum. After a month of using this serum from a sample pack I bought (Oily/Acne), my skin cleared up for the first time in YEARS!!!!!! When I ran out of the expensive serum, I started to get zits again but not as bad as before. After a few months I finally had money to buy it and my skin immediately started to clear again. I love Mychelle products, if you have oily/acne skin,Vitamin C serum is a MUST!!!!!!!! Mychelle products are great because they are not full of chemicals. I just wish that it was less expensive. Amazon seems to have a good price compared to retail.
B000C234ZY|3|Pretty good. Only problem was we thought we were getting perfume, and this is more of a cologne.
B00F9ACH8O|5|I have baby fine hair.  My temples and hairline have thinned as I age. Nioxin Cleanser and Scalp Therapy work well for me.  I love the way the product makes my scalp feel. For a year or so I stopped using Nioxin and my hair became noticeably thinner. Now after a year even my hairdresser notices improvement.
B0083V8SE8|5|I do not know about the ageing part but I have really dry skin, especially winter months, and this product really hydrates my face.  I love it and will buty some more. oh, very prompt delivery service too
B002E2Y0X0|2|Does what it's supposed to do meaning it gets you clean.  as far as the scent it could just as well be axle grease.<br />I wouldn't personnally purchase this again.  I was expecting maybe a stinging sensation after reading the advertisment.  It's been in my shower for 8 months now and been used maybe 3 times.  The commercials for ALL of AXE products take license with over embellishing the products capacities and any qualities there may have.  After a shower with Axe shower gel, the scent is so faint within 5 minutes its negligible.
B000CNKC62|4|This is a great cologne. Very citrusy, but in a good way. I love this scent! Only reason it gets 4 stars is that it doesn't project well so others can not smell it except for immediately after you spray it. Also, does not last too long. It could just be me, but it does not last as long as I would like. Other than that, love this scent. Just the way it smells is great.
B005V22SEI|5|I really like this brand of lavender essential oil.  I was having issues with ingrown hairs and my esthetician said this would help and she was right.  I put a little on my trouble areas a few times a week and haven't had anymore problems.
B002TJJX30|5|The nicest body wash I've ever used.  You need very little so the price, which looks rather expensive, is reasonable.  It's very sudsy, creamy on your skin and has a wonderful aroma.
B00JBX9O5O|5|I was not expecting such quality for the price. It works incredibly.
B004CF7RMS|3|They run to small. I but them for a friend who is a teacher and she needs to write a lot and with the arthritis is having a lot of trouble but she gave them back to me because it can not fit her. I will try them myself
B005L9VUHM|5|I am a PRO MUA and love these brushes. I like the stiffness of the brushes and they fact they do not lose it after cleaning them fifty million times a day. As a pro MUA I sonic clean my brushes and pretty hard since I clean them many times during an event or job. These DO NOT LOSE bristles. That is a huge plus. The eye kit is pretty define on use. The blender blends well but I will stick to my good old 217 for a soft effect. The only thing that took me awhile to get use to was the girth of the brush. It is a little more heavy than my other brushes, but the learning curve was short. I plan on ordering more the next time I am in need of brushes.<br />The shipping was VERY QUICK. Oh I want to note I have been using these brushes for over 2 months now.
B003YJAZZE|5|I was skeptical at first, since I have sensitive skin, curly and coarse hair. I've used the shaver about 10 times and I have to say I am impressed with the performance. The one thing I did notice and it's not much of the products fault is that I have to make several passes to ensure it cuts all my facial hairs. I didn't make a big deal about it, because even with a disposable razor, I have to make several passes as well. (my facial hairs grow in all directions) I also enjoy the anti-bactrial cleaning.<br /><br />If I shaved with a disposable razor, I am unable to shave for another 4 days minimal without doing damage to my face. However, with the Braun 760 shaver system. I can shave everyday.<br /><br />For men with sensitive skin and suffer from razor bumps, irritated skin and ingrown hairs. This is a product you should look into. Glad I purchased the razor!
B003BWNR9A|5|At first I was concerned that the brush I received did not look like the picture. It didn't have the Omega logo printed on the handle nor the &#34;48&#34; on the bottom. The box was a Proraso box. After some research, I learned that the Omega 48 and the Proraso are the same brush. Quality is great. This thing lathers like a champ. Good investment.
B000P257CO|1|this is the worst smell I have ever smelled , I currently trying to get a refund
B00JITDVCI|4|bought this for my daughter & she loves it. not good for underarms but that doesn't bother her as she wanted it for her legs & facial hair
B004U7ICW2|5|Never was a make up person, but this concealed my blemishes after I used a strong dose of an ointment with Retinol. My cheeks looked so pimply, I was happy for this concealer. I have used it for a year, the time it took for my skin to heal itself. I purchased a second tube for the days when I feel like making up my face. This is not cakey and lasts the entire day without a touch up. With just a little drop, applied with a concealer brush this product should last one year
B008KEJ1LM|4|Requires a decent bit of maintenance and attention, and makes some odd noises when it's not happy with the way you're using it. Just take care of it by following the directions specified by the manufacturer, and it should be a good device. It shaves decently, but I didn't expect much to begin with.
B0014AI4VM|4|Manual toothbrushes hurt my gum line and I dont have the cash to spend on high end electric toothbrushes. The Spinbrush pro is the best bargain! I'm very happy with my purchase and glad Amazon.com came thru with the quick shipment!
B009SRWF4U|5|This face wash is wonderful! I am a 36 year old who still deals with occasional acne. I also have very oily skin. Here's how I use this...First, I exfoliate my face to get off any dead skin cells. This helps to fully cleanse my face. Then, I apply this wash all over my face & get up a good foam. Then I use water & rub my face with my hands for a couple minutes or I gently use my konjac sponge. Finally, I rinse thoroughly. It foams up nicely like I said, & doesn't dry out my face. After I wash, I follow up with an oil free moisturizer. I use this product daily & it has really helped control my acne. I hardly get any blemishes anymore! I highly recommend this face wash. I was given a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
B0043RL0SC|1|I was told that this was the right part, but it is not.  The sight said that if the part number does not match it may be new so do not worry.  Now I have 2 heads that do not work.
B000F63TW0|5|I've only been using this product for about a month, twice a week. On the other 5 days I use Olay Total Effects 7 (usually in the morning) and between the two products I've gotten great results at an extremely affordable price! I highly recommend both products- I don't think you'll be disappointed at all!
B000VA7UX4|3|This isn't as soft as the youtubers make it seem. I would not have bought it if I had known that. However, it does give good 'curl definition' on wet hair.<br /><br />For the 'naturals' out there, I have '4a' type hair, low density (fine/thin hair) and low porosity.<br /><br />PROS: Gives good curl definition on my WET hair WITH some kind of product in it eg. Cantu shea butter cream<br /><br />CONS: Do NOT use this on DRY hair. It will break your hair.<br />Even when used on WET detangled hair with product,I still found that there were too many strands left in the Denman brush (I think the teezer is 'softer' than the Denman though).<br /><br />Overall, I would NOT buy this again and would NOT recommend it to a 'natural' sista. To me, it's not worth it.
B0049LUI9O|5|Solid feel. While using it to clean my nose hairs, it initially felt as if to not be strong enough but when I got done and looked into my nostrils, they were both quite clean. Frankly, I don't know the first thing about how strong nor how effective something like this is supposed to be, but this unit appears to do exactly what it is designed to do - clear the hairs from your nostrils.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Excellent product. This is my second order.
B001J835RM|5|Love this color and it looks really pretty on, very natural.
B00M4ZRZJI|4|I love this fragrance, it doesn't last long on my skin, but on my clothes a few hours!
B00GXFPWZY|5|Love this oil. It's soft without leaving an over abundant amount of residue. I love it.<br />I will definitely reorder this.
B00E4PMQAO|1|This trimmer costs about twice as much as basic trimmers and is described as heavy duty, lifetime guarantee, etc.  It is actually a total piece of crap.  It is impossible to get the cap back on once you put the battery in.  The plastic part on the outside comes off when it should be integrated into the body of the trimmer.  Little parts around the head easily fall out of place.  Don't waste your money.
B007RTR8T8|4|I've been using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty line for awhile now, specifically the Shea Ultra Nourishing shampoo & conditioner.  I love it. I recieved this conditioner last week and I'm equally impressed.<br /><br />I have really long, naturally pin straight, relatively thick hair.  It has never been dyed or treated in any way.  I shampoo & condition daily despite being told \\"its not good\\" well, I've done it all my life and I still get complimented on how healthy my hair is, so...<br /><br />This conditioner smells wonderful.  Floral and fresh were my initial thoughts. It felt thick, easily coated my hair with just a dime sized amount and rinsed out cleanly.<br /><br />Afterwards my hair felt soft, nourished and smelled fantastic.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just easy to please, but this new line of shampoo & conditioners has me hooked!
B004061V30|5|I do all the haircuts for my boys at home and they hate the hair clippings cause it makes them itch.......not any more. Their cuts have become more pleasant for them and less frustrating for me. I Needed this a long time ago lol
B0020MMDK6|5|it is deodorant, really good smelling deodorant.
B002WLKN9S|5|I started with Origins products in February of this year and am extremely pleased.  They're expensive but a little bit goes a very long way.  This has a very light, foaming consistency which seems to clean quickly.  Fragrance is quite nice as well.
B000XDCGOM|5|Recommended by my dermatologist.
B001SB9CL8|5|Great
B000ODY90A|5|All went fine
B000JJHCD0|5|I have really sensitive skin and this is pretty much the only foundation that won't make me break out. The SPF is a great add and the coverage and color is AMAZING and just perfect. It's not like a slab of pain on your face but covers really well.
B003W5YCVI|4|Cannot use it every day as it makes my fine hair heavy and flat.  Great for my son's cradle cap, no more flaki skin on his head.  Nice smelling.
B000J3RG00|5|No complaints. I've been using Larenim for a few years now and love the absence of bismuth oxychloride.
B00AX3YNPC|5|I wish I bought this years ago!  I hate shaving but I hate stubble more.  I was shaving every. single. day.  Decided to give this a try and I'm so glad I did!  The pain is minor, though I do recommend doing sensitive areas underwater.  I use maybe once a week and do nothing in between!  Afterwards, some Bliss body butter and I'm smooth and silky.  The only negative I have is that the brush doesn't seem effective at exfoliation.  If you want to save a few $, buy the one without.  Otherwise, I love it!
B005T7VA4Y|5|Excellent item
B00HSNWZFU|5|What a wonderful shampoo and fragrance. Both my wife and I have fully enjoyed this product and how it leaves our hair so soft and silky. It has a rich lather with such a small amount of the shampoo.<br />We will definitely be buying more of this in the future.
B003K44E6Y|5|This is the REAL deal. Smells great and the girls love it. Thanks for sending what you advertise. Good Job
B000P5OVHI|5|This is a great little cart. It rolls and has enough room for machine on each will purchase more in future
B0009OAI2C|5|Excellent product
B005V1J9PK|5|Perfect brushes never shed!
B0047TMD7S|5|Work awesome!! Very bold colors. I love them :)
B003156NFW|5|The product matches the description.
B002WJHJYM|5|I Love Love this cologne.  I have been looking for a Ginger cologne to go with my Thymes Ginger Body Wash. The scent is nice and mild not overpowering and it lasts for hours. If you like ginger you will love this one by Thymes. I had not been able to find this cologne in the stores were I buy my body wash. I have other Thymes fragrances, they live up to their name.
B008MP6PX6|2|I used this and was extremely disappointed especially for the amount of money it cost. Just because I hadn't made a choice on what product to try next as a face moisturizer and didn't have anything on hand I put some body moisturizer I bought on my face (Hempz Pomegranate) it works FANTASTIC my face is so soft and feels amazing. Don't waste your money on this product
B003YDZON8|5|This product has a pretty strong \\"nutty\\" odor to it, but I do like the product.  It does make you skin very soft; however, it caused my face to break out, so I had to discontinue using it.  I do still use it for dry patchy areas on my legs as I suffer from ezcema and it does help heal those areas.  Would still recommend this product even though I am unable to use it on my face.  :)
B000I5HJ2Y|5|I have read some of the reviews that said these are fakes.  I don't know about that but, they work very well.  They are very soft on the face, blend makeup excellently and the price for two is outstanding.
B007DKSZFW|5|always wondered why eb5 did not take off or why I can't find it except online. the best product ever and the face cream is to die for....
B001HBHLF8|5|I had one before and last forever, it  does flat iron your hair really nice and shiny.
B000WNLFBI|5|For those of you that like Aquaphor or Vaseline for lips, cuticles, feet, dry skin...Egyptian Magic is so much better! It's natural and doesn't have any scent or taste. It is not a cream, more of a balm but absorbs well and leaves your skin so smooth! I use for very dry areas like my lips, hands/feet. My son had a few dry patches on his back (eczema type) and this helped him a lot.  It has a Vaseline type texture but doesn't have petroleum or other nasty things.  I use it everyday and love it! If you have an aversion to products that are a bit &#34;greasy&#34; and have an oily feel then this may not be for you but I have very dry skin so I need the moisture.<br />Hope this helps your decision.
B007OT1QMQ|5|I really like these headbands. I use them mainly when washing my face, but I have found myself wearing them when working out and sometimes just for fun, too. These are really good headbands for the price, and I'm very happy I made this purchase.
B00B6L0MJ6|5|It works
B00JITDVCI|1|there is no package for this item. it looks really bad. I plan to return it.
B0085MRIHS|5|Works great for me. Smells nice and holds well.  You can put it on wet or dry hair for different looks. Washes out easy.
B00ANCZVMW|3|Should come with a extra set of magnets
B0002Z8QG8|3|This brush is ok, I think it would br better without the rubber cushion, it pulls on my hair a little too much.
B002H8TVVM|5|Very good.
B0009DT39W|2|I've used others easier to get a good curl.  I'd pass on this one as it is difficult to use.
B003BWNR9A|3|I've had issues with the seller FGP. They ended up sending me this brush with mock badger coloring. The bristles are too long and they are not firm enough. I can't say its completely awful, but its not good either. As for the seller, STAY AWAY!
B007BJ3KQ4|5|Much better quality than I expected for the price.  I wanted the nipper, but the other tool are surprisingly more useful than I thought they would be.
B00HNKRYP4|4|my husband received this lotion from the latest influenster vox box and has been using it for the last month or so.  he found the lotion to have a nice texture and to be very moisturizing.  however, he really didn't care for the intensity of the scent.  the other negative was that the lotion felt very cold coming out of the bottle because of the spray.  not his favorite product, but a decent lotion to have on hand!
B008GR4L18|5|My wife bought this for our anniversary getaway this coming weekend.  It looks awesome!!!  The color is just like the picture!
B004U3LQMY|5|Even after brushing my 7 year old's teeth regularly, I wasn't able to figure out the cause of bad breath. These tongue scrapers<br />solved my issue . We all started using these and we love the ease of use and its clean effect.
B00VHKDV94|4|It's good
B00SETTZGE|5|Great face wash! Clears up my skin and I feel fresh after each wash.
B000VHH6TK|5|Love this stud!
B000JL7Z9Y|5|I was very happy to still be able to get this and not have it not cost me an arm and a leg because it was discontinued a long time ago and. I received it quickly..the only frustrating thing is the spray mechanism sticks and is difficult to spray but I will survive it and I am still very happy thank you so much
B001CQ22UM|5|The smell of this Talcum Powder is so very soft and wonderful.  A little goes a long way, you get value for your money and you will smell great while you at it. Buy it , you'll see.
B008MOYEYO|5|Love it!!!!
B000CSH3YG|5|This wash cloth/towel makes your skin feel so smooth and silky.  I highly recommend this to anyone who may have doubts as I did.  It's long enough to cleanse the entire back area and suds up wonderfully.  It also dries extremely fast.  But the best part is how soft and silky your entire body is after use.  Give it a try - you will be very pleased you did!
B004PQIQFQ|5|Effective, non-irritating, thorough, not too oily, not smelly. Best yet. Rated pretty good on Skin Deep, the Environmental Working Group website, which is, by the way, the Bible on cosmetics and chemicals.
B0016L0PFM|5|I have very fine, wimpy hair and without this product my hair would look awful.  I just hope I can still find it when I run out as it has been discontinued in all beauty supply stores, etc.  Keeping my fingers crossed.
B00FDK0V4M|5|I have been using this product for about a week.<br />Have noticed improvement in my skin. It is balance not oily or dry. My complexion is way better since I have been using this product. Hopefully they don't change the formula. I will keep ordering.
B00DDMIVSA|3|I would say for the price I paid this is a pretty good value.I usually use it after I have already used my Dove deep clean soap,,to add a lil scent.I probably would not buy w/o coupon or markdown,paid less than $3 for this,,seems reasonable,,
B003USIHZY|5|OH MY GOODNESS! Where was this 4 years ago when I decided to say screw it with my curly hair and straighten it for 4 years which then resulted in split ends like you wouldn't believe and pissed off hair?! This stuff is seriously HG status! I only have to put in a leave in conditioner (and that's more by choice) and then put this stuff in and my curls look like I took a curling iron to them! Ugh, I'm so in love! I can finally wash and go! Thank God! I will definitely be purchasing the liter size and highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or even wavy hair! Just do it!
B003H1HCIM|5|This really works! Thank you
B00DVMYZX2|4|It did not have organic on the package and it did smell a bit, but the smell went away. I made Chapstick with it and it didn't effect it at all. I would buy again
B000MASTJM|5|I have used this for years but it is so hard to find anymore and I hate to have to give it up
B00SEJ0ZQ8|5|great scent, a lot of product for the money.
B004MKNV1E|1|No change to my daughter's medium-brown hair, or my other daughter's medium-blonde hair. Did not glow in the dark. A total waste of time and money for Halloween.
B000PGMO5I|5|A+++ Honest company to deal with, exactly what I wanted.  Will order from again ! ! !
B001N9FZJI|1|I use badedas and love the smell....also I have a potpourri with the badedas aroma and this is very pleasant and similar to the bath gel smell, but this badedas oil no matter how I regulate the drops ...it doesn't smell anything like the badedas smell and isn't very nice to smell at all
B003BHLOUE|4|A female fragrance is difficult to describe with English.  It is deliberately hedonic without further necessity for communication.  This perfume provides a private intimate space, and a personal scent to share.  It has subtle dominant sharpness within, and a powdery, deep, and sweet maturity overall.  There is a strong middle bitterness of desire.  It sounds like sex by its name, but can easily be worn out into public.  The price is really great, too!  The strength and captivation make a really great scent for a sex drive girl.
B0069SQQ2I|5|I have fallen in love with Plant Therapy essential oils. I am not an expert when it comes to oils but I have been using them for a long time, and have tried a lot of different brands. The Plant Therapy essential oils are by far the best I've found, especially for the price. my favorites are lavender, orange, peppermint and tea tree.
B000V3O0ZC|2|This product goes on sticky, just as well use a &#34;dry&#34; stick and save having to inhale the fumes!
B00TKS5Y3Q|5|Very high quality nail clippers. They come in their own package so I can carry them with me without worrying if they're going to get lost or damaged. The manufacturer says they worked hard on ensuring quality and it's very apparent, every detail seems to be thought of here
B0042L04I6|2|Looked great besides the slice in it. Other than that I would of gave it 5 stars
B004YBW5T0|2|My Shea Butter came in a two plastic bags inside of a box.  When I opened the shea butter to use in my lotion, I noticed spots of what looked like mold.  When I began digging around, I found that it was small pieces of blue plastic.  There were at least five pieces in different areas of the butter.  I guess it's not really a big deal, I'm glad it wasn't mold, but what the heck could it be?  When it says unrefined, I don't expect to find small pieces of plastic in it.  While this product came quickly, I probably won't buy from this seller again.
B0007CHJL4|1|I have developed a painful, red rash and burning from only using this product for 2 days. I immediately stopped using this product but I am still experiencing burning and pain and it's been over a week. I have researched this on the internet and have found many similar claims. I  contacted the company and they are requesting I send the product (and providing a postage paid envelope) to them for testing. They are also providing a refund or replacement product in exchange. If you have even mildly sensitive skin I would definitely not recommend using this product.
B000VOPI4S|5|My husband doesn't use anything but Lomanu
B00HLYWNIA|3|Mine was much much darker than pictured. Almost black
B002VANNWY|4|Smells lovely, lots of bubbles, and I trust what's in it.
B0017ZJWD8|5|Best facial wash I have found... use very little and it leaves really clean feeling...not tight or filmy.
B00565D6XW|1|BUYERS BEWARE.<br />I have been looking for a product like this and was really excited to test it out.<br />It came and it was smaller than I anticipated, but either way, I really liked the concept.<br /><br />So the actual usage of this product is alright, the problem arises is how you clean off the dirt that is on the exfoliator. It made sense to me that you just use your finger and gently rub the dirt away, but instead it CUT MY FINGER. It wasn't just a shallow cut either, it was a deep enough cut that I needed to get out of the shower and put some Neosporin and a bandaid on it right away.<br /><br />That is the BIGGEST FLAW of this product. It's sharp enough to break skin and cut your finger, and probably other parts of your body if you aren't careful.
B003JN8PNO|5|As I thought!!!
B000MSHN00|5|Love this multi-vitamin. It's the only way my body will allow iron supplements. And with only one pill per day and they aren't giant horse pills, I'd say it's great!
B001E77UM4|5|I love this bubble bath because it has none of the harsh ingredients or chemicals (SLSs) and it bubbles nicely - especially if you sort of stir up the water as the bath runs. My skin always feels soft when I get out of the tub and not itchy or dry at all. It is scented, but not overpowering in any way. We use this scent along with the vanilla coconut for our boys and the rose geranium as well. All are very nice.
B0040919CU|5|Both the flat iron and blow dryer are produce sufficient heat to straighten my hair, which is very curly. And both products are too cute!!
B000C2380U|5|I use no other parfumerie any more! It's not an over powering scent and I love it! I use it everyday.
B00KUENG52|5|This is an excellent leave in conditioner that makes my hair shine and feel soft.
B003CJ9FOI|5|I recently became obsessed with the show Mad Men and was dying for a lipstick that made me look like Joan Holloway (which is impossible; she's flawless) and I found this on Pinterest. I don't think MAC stores have it anymore, so when I found it here I was so happy. This is the most Mad Men color in the world and it's so creamy. Great buy, even with the added $5 as compared to retail.
B00FSBK6UA|5|Real talk right now.. I saw a big differences the first time I use this cream..
B00COD5H9U|1|Dont really know how the product is for it came damaged and broken in an envelope.
B00EPEZURA|5|Awesome comb! I was blown away by how nice the wood smelled and how beautiful it is. Also good for your hair!
B0077TLO4I|5|So far Kiehl's dark spot solution seems to be fading some of my spots.  I will keep using it for a while before I decide.
B005EEI33I|5|I've had a hard time finding this product in this scent and I just love this! Thank you!!
B000SPD1SK|1|This was smaller than anticipated.  It lasted for 1 use then lost both air and suction.  This is a very poorly made product.  Don't waste your money.
B003JN4N6W|5|Product was what I expected and it is ust like I use to buy in the stores over 10 years ago.
B001B0X05U|1|I had never smelled this fragrance before, but when I saw it on sale for $3, and after reading the reviews, which indicated that this was the better smelling of all the Yacht Man varieties, I decided to give it a try. After shipping and handling this bottle of water cost me $7.31!!  When sprayed initially it has absolutely no smell, but afterward a faint smell devolped, smelled more like perspiration!!!  What a waste! I do not believe the bottle I got is an authentic fragrance.
B004W5RCNM|5|There is a color for every occasion! I love anything that sparkles so these were perfect for me. And if u get the glitter eyeliners it definitely makes an impression on people when they see u!  I've gotten a lot of wonderful comments on how great my makeup looks! I luv them.
B001AY48GW|4|creamy and totally rinsible. doesn't leave any sticky residue. have rosacea and st ives seems to reallly work for me. this leaves my skin so soft. my make up seems to feel and look much better and natural after using this cleanser for 2 weekis.
B00417PVIO|3|This two step system is new to me, although I use the Go Smile system regularly. I thought I'd give this one a try. The prep gel is almost non-existent. Not sure if my product was just old or if that is how it is supposed to be. The gel in the tube was all at the bottom and very thick and globby. In one tube the gel had hardened. I've tried 3 days worth (of 4) and can see some whitening, but not as much as the new(ish) double-ended tubes. Sorry for the lack of technical terms!
B001C99RUM|5|These Wahl Tattoo trimmers get the job done
B000WUCHVS|5|My dermatologist recommended this product, but I was been unable to find it in the stores.  I was a bit daunted by its size, as it is  bulky in the shower caddy.  However, the quality of the product more than makes up for that fact.  It foams perfectly with my Clarisonic and leaves no residue on my face.  I am quite picky when it comes to face wash products, and this is one of my favorites.
B0030HKJ8I|3|I mean, I'm okay with it, but I would recommend getting a different color.  The eggplant can barely be seen.  It just looks like a thin line of eye shadow...  So if that's the look you're going for, I guess it's perfect.  I also have this product in charcoal and glam black, and love both of those.  This color leaves a lot to be desired.
B00JVTUA4M|5|Best foundation brush ever
B00A0IWRU8|5|I've tried three of the Moroccan lines of Suave - the Keratin-infused, Color Care, and now the Infusion Shine.  I have to say, all are great products and work as promised, leaving hair clean, smooth, with less frizzies and more life.  At the price, I don't think you can go wrong with any of them - they have a nice clean smell and work as promised.  The shine conditioner went on smoothly and left hair feeling smooth and yes, with a bit of added shine.  I used this with the moroccan oil style by Suave and was really impressed with the end result.
B00GP9ZE10|5|Very easy to use. The light is a great extra touch. Works great.<br />Will be buying one for a family member too.
B00153Z3I0|5|Great product, only bleached my ends because i was afraid it would damage my hair, which it did in the spots i did bleach, but it was a beautiful dark purple on the spots that werent bleached and faded into a bright pink/purple color. love this product
B009WS6MVW|3|I didn't realize this was shipping from China when I ordered it.  It took 3 weeks to arrive and I could have very easily driven to Claire's or another teeny bopper store and picked up the same thing.  These were a bit too tight and had to be stretched to work on my hair but I have waist-length hair.
B000JIOQV2|5|I love this product! Does exactly as advertised. Very impressed. Only thing I don't like is the applicator for the whitener, would have much preferred the old Hollywood Smiles Nail Polish Type application.
B00HREN5EA|5|Excellent products. Recommend.
B006UETAO2|5|I loved
B00AX3YNPC|3|Did not grab all the hair. Even though it's supposed to leave smoother skin, my skin feels rough like sand paper. Hair come back within a week
B0047ZVSSM|5|It seems to be working slowly, but it makes my hair feel very soft and helps seem to define the curls also.
B0055TA53I|3|It has strong smell and dries hair, will not purchase again
B001459IEE|5|arrived on time and as described. I compared this lotion at the local stores and this was the best deal out there.
B00NG1NIPY|1|Terrible.i followed all the instructions. Extremely messy process and useless
B00GMAWI66|5|This is my first time using Virgin Argan Oil and I'm loving it. I recently transitioned back to my natural state of hair - no more harsh chemicals - and heard of Argan oil being a good product to use. It is light, and non-greasy and makes my hair even softer than it already is and adds a nice shine as well. I'm looking forward to trying its other uses as well, such as on my skin, etc. . .  The product was delivered quickly and nicely packaged. I give this product and merchant five stars!!
B000XR8NPY|5|I would recommend this to everyone. Price. Product is just superb. HUGE bundles, well-wrapped (excluding delivery method, as they pretty well smushed my whole order)... well-wrapped individually. Was not their fault total packaging was amiss as far as protective materials, must've been new on tha job. Taking poor initial packing job into account, these fared one: perfect, second one: minor but annoying crumbling...  and  like I said, due to poor initial packaging from warehouse portion of the process.<br />White Sage Smudge Stick Two Pack, 9&#34; Tom's Incense??? total satisfaction. Will buy again.
B007BLHNWO|1|I have never used this product but it does not hold like hair spray and it does not add shine I am not sure what it does except cost to much money.....
B004LQGQ48|5|My daughter was shocked when she received this package. It was a set for beginner nail techs. It came with UV glove and a starter kit. In which, my daughter has learned the techniques so far on her own. I just wanted her to have the materials to have to maybe help her become an expert. I received this ahead of schedule and without any damage. Thanks.
B005E0OG2O|4|awesome razor<br />just make sure you have someone there to spot you if its your first time shaving with a straight razor.
B00L3KEIZO|5|I used to have chronic swelling around my eyes, leading to generally unattractive blotchy redness. I thought it would improve if I just got more sleep, but alas the puffiness would not go away! I heard about the wonders of cucumber cream, and decided to try this as I trust NuNutrients products. After about two weeks, all signs of blotchiness went away and now my face feels smooth and taut once again! I used to get people asking me if I was getting enough sleep, annoyingly I never knew what it was. I have since used substantially less applications, and it is still working great. I now swear by cucumber extracts for all of my skin products.
B005E1DNAY|5|This product seems to work well diminising lines around the eye area and seems to have an nice tingling on skin.
B000GVQU52|5|this is an excellent lip balm, it is similar to nars sabrina....except that it is not pink, its more of a nude and its a bit sheer. It feels great, it makes my lips feel bigger, it smells and tastes like strawberries! love it!
B00020M6YQ|5|My beautician has been using this product on my hair for a long time and I tried to order it from a beauty supply shop that is available to the public, only to have them tell me they no longer carry it...after waiting for three weeks.  I checked amazon.com, found out they had it and within a week, it was delivered.  I love the fragrance and how it holds my hair without making it stiff and hard to comb, and being that it is concentrated, it is well worth the cost because one bottle makes a gallon.
B0046VGPHQ|5|Very easy to appy. Doesn't look orange anywhere except for a hint on my knuckles which was a little brassy/dirty looking. I'm not going to let it sit on my hands for very long because they darkened the fastest even spraying the liquid on the glove first. I'm pale and tan very very little naturally so tanning beds and laying out like most girls aren't an option so I'm very happy to have found something that looks natural even though its fake :)
B008TYM5P2|5|I love this product! It works really well on my hair and I would recommend it. It smells nice too.
B003NH03JK|5|Arrived as stated.  Happy with the product.
B005URUARQ|5|Finally a skincarevas product line that delivers great results and is affordable. Great for acne or breakout prone skin too.
B000P22TIY|5|Smells great but not overpowering. Very clean and refreshing fragrance. Awesome price...highly recommended. Just buy it...you won't regret it. :)
B00BHGW4BE|4|DDDDDDDDD
B00AWJW566|5|wife loves these on me and off. when I saw her eyes wide open I new they were keepers. just don't pop a boner in em!
B008DKYM8K|2|So an interesting thing has happened: the next package of this soap had a much lighter scent.  We purchased a 3-pack from Amazon (as the seller as well, not third party), and as I wrote in the original review, it was incredibly strong and unpleasant.  We finally finished the first bag, so I opened up the next package and poured it into the dispenser- it was completely different in how strong it was.  I would say 20 times less strong seriously.  The scent was very light, but it is definitely the same scent, so their claim that it is unscented is clearly a falsehood.  (By the way the scent lingers on your hands for probably 5 minutes after you use it).<br /><br />It seems obvious that there was a production error which dumped a large quantity of the fragrance into the batch, and I now wonder if the same occurred in the lavender scent we tied as well (we had just one bag of that one as it came with the pump) as it was equally as insanely strong smelling.  Perhaps the fragrance is added to each bag as it goes down the production line, and therefore there is more opportunity for things to go wrong?<br /><br />Anyway, the rating is staying unchanged due to the fact that they state that it is unscented, and yet this is clearly not true.  Also, there seems to be a problem in the production process which result in VERY overly scented bags, and there is no quality control to catch these mistakes.<br /><br />Original review Jan 5 2013:<br /><br />Wow, talk about a misnomer!  This stuff is just plain horrid; it smells like 'White Shoulders' perfume, a favorite of the elderly lady crowd.  It's not as strongly scented as the lavender version (more on that later), but just very unpleasant in that 'sickly sweet and floral' way.<br /><br />Two stars because it dispenses perfectly from the simplehuman pump for which it was made, and the soap works well to clean your hands.<br /><br />Backstory: We actually purchased this because the trial soap which came with the pump (lavender scent) has a very strong smell not only to me, but also my hubby, and neither of us are sensitive to strong aromas.  Probably to-die-for for those who really love lavender, but for us it's almost eye-watering in its pungency.  Your hands smell of it for a long time after washing up, and that just wasn't what he was looking for.  ;)<br /><br />The antibacterial version is really nice; it's quite neutral smelling and it does not contain triclosan, which is used in many antibacterial soaps and is currently under investigation by the FDA and Health Canada, so that's a bonus.<br /><br />Hope this helps those wondering about the scents, but especially those with fragrance sensitivity issues.
B007VEPVZC|5|A wonderful and natural replacement for any creams or serums for anti- wrinkle. After two days of use, skin appears more supple. Looking forward to three months of use to diminish wrinkles. Also, this product is well priced for quality.
B007MPDZ44|5|This hair was on time I have combed it no shedding it curls like a dream it straights like a dream love love love I say get this hair awesome and got it in two days
B00SWS5C6E|5|I love it.  Very easy to use and curls perfect.
B0021AG0Z6|4|This is the best electric shaver I've used.  Blades still do a better job around the neck, but this Panasonic does a very good job.  You do have to make several passes to get a close shave, but owing to the wet/dry feature my skin is smoother and un-irritated as it would be with a blade or dry only electric.
B000FRWNL2|5|super HOT. People are just amazed at how well this product performs. Bought for 10yr old, should have adult supervision.
B0042PT8Z2|5|I've been wearing this brand/color for several years now, I love it.  It goes well with my skin tone and stays on super long.
B00538TSMU|5|I bought these because I need to practice putting lashes on and it's a good value 20 pair for the price you pay for one pair at the beauty mart. Surprisingly they are good quality. I like the thick ones for a fuller dramatic night look, and the thin ones if I want to be extra fab during the day the don't look like you've stuck your finger in socket and electrocuted your self LOL.
B00L673A5S|4|Container wasn't sealed so the crystals were all over the place hard to reorganize. Otherwise happy with purchase.
B004H0WKYS|3|I'd read some good reviews about this product, so I thought I'd give it a try. In fairness, I haven't given it much milage on my face for a couple reasons. First of all, SC-1 is much too pigmented for my fair skin. I assume you're meant to blend the colors to match your shade, or you use them as correcting tints. Either way the result is far too much color. The left side is pink but too dark on an ivory complexion, making the skin look irritated. The right side is lighter, but very yellow and still a bit too dark. Using it around the eyes made me look like I had jaundice or fading bruises. Blending the two colors created a peachy-orange with the same effect.<br /><br />Secondly, while Secret Camoflage gave decent coverage, it did not apply smoothly with brush or sponge. With aging skin, any product that's so dry, sticky, or waxy that it tugs at the skin is unpleasant to apply.<br /><br />It does have great coverage, but sits on the surface of your skin. In other words, it's very opaque. I found that it did not blend well into surrounding bare skin or a less opaque foundation - even when set with neutral powder. The product reminds me of theater make-up. If you like or need that level of coverage and color, Secret Camouflage is a good product that works as claimed. I believe it would even cover a man's beard shadow, though the amount of product is very limited for that.<br /><br />But if you're very, very fair skinned with translucent, neutral, or blue undertones, you'll probably find SC-1 has too much pigment for a natural or blendable look.
B000GG1944|5|I have been suffering from breakage around my hair line area, from over processing my bangs and layers in the front with blowdrying and flat irons. There is one area of my hair that is unbelievably brittle, just seems to grow in that way and nothign has been able to fix it. This product seemst o be working to tame it adn stop the brittle feeling and the dryness.<br /><br />The first tiem i used it i had washed my hair with the nexxus moisturizing shampoo then put this on for 5 minutes. it went on like a hot oil treatment, felt kinda greasy and oily. but i left it on and then rinsed it out. you have to either use the shampoo again or put on a thick moisturizer after it is rinsed otu though. otherwise it feels like oil slick or grease. i didnt notice until i was blow drying my hair how much better it felt!<br /><br />i am going to use this twice aweek, its worth the money!
B00006498N|5|I've been using hair dryers for over 20 years and this one is by far the best one I've used.  It gives you the control which is often lacking on other models.  It's especially effective if you want to straighten your hair (for those of us with curly hair and wish we didn't have it).  I highly recommend this product.
B008GRDTPW|1|Not good quality . Polka dots missing on half of them. Very hard to work with.
B00ANGW7XE|5|works wonderfully when my hair is wet, beautiful colors. hair chalk definitely does dry out your hair however, so use it sparingly.
B006T9BBM2|5|Love the colors and how easy they are to use. I will be buying more here very soon. Cant wait.
B002IFNS36|5|these are the best blades by far....i will buy these again and have recommended personna to all my friends.....
B003JTF3VK|4|lightweight.. doesn't break out my sensitive skin.. overall satisfied.. not oily, and moisturizes well.. the smell is ok.  price seems reasonable for what you get
