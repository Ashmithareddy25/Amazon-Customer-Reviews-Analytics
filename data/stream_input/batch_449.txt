B00063MBU8|5.0|For anyone who likes Simple Plan you will love this CD. Pierre's voice has changed and he sounds so good especially with &quot;Perfect World&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;! It is just a great all around CD with a good mix of soft songs and dare I say &quot;punkish&quot; songs. I am so sick of hearing they are so not a punk band! Who cares...they are what they are and last time I checked they never said they were a punk band! If you are looking for a great listen all they way through CD this is it!
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|This movie epitomizes every reason why I am beginning to hate Hollywood.  They all live in a fantasy world where the plot of this movie makes sense and is acceptable.  This movie is one of the crappiest pieces of dog mess that I have ever had the displeasure of watching.      Let's forget the overacting for a minute.  No, let's not.  That scene in the beginning Sean Penn crying and being restrained by the cops did not, and I repeat DID NOT qualify as Oscar material.  I laughed at it.  This movie was completely over the top.    O, did I mention that I fell asleep the first time?      Anyways, I'm not going to say that this had potential b/c to give it potential would be to scrap this entire script.  Nothing in it makes sense.  I am truly fighting the urge to spoil it (well, some reviewers already did). I just want to say this: I thought it was very traitorous how Celeste sold out Dave to Jimmy. ESPECIALLY since she didn't even know for sure if he killed Katie.  And then at the end, she's concerned when he goes missing.  Well duh!  You sold your husband and your son's father out to a known convict.  Also, it sickened me how they set Dave up.  I'm really mad how Jimmy lied to him and made him think that if he said he did it, he'd live.  Dave didn't even die with dignity. Geez. And somehow we're supposed to cheer Jimmy on for \\"serving justice.\\"  He should be locked up and the key to his cell should be thrown in the Mystic!    And then at the end when Kevin Bacon finds out that Jimmy offed Dave. Does nothing about it.  We are treated to a phone call by his wife that served no relevance to the movie.  Give me a break.  A man just died and we are served to smiles and happy times by all characters involved in an ending coverup.  Celeste at the end deserved what she got, but not Dave's son (who was on the float upset b/c his dad wasn't there).      Unfreakin' believable that Sean Penn kills Dave, goes home and tells his wife, and then she appeases this murderer by saying hedid what he had to do and it's ok if he wants to do it again.  And then we are treated to a tasteless shot of her getting ready to satisfy him.  Utter trash.    I hate movies like this and I hate Hollywood for thinking we are so stupid to enjoy this drivel and believe that this is how the world should be.  Gee, that thinking cost yall the '04 election, didn't it?  Nuff said.
B00005JLXE|4.0|many spiderman fans will continue to trash what they see as the competiton. they will put down daredevil for being \\"cliche\\" while supporting a film with a green goblin and lines like \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\" and ask you to believe that one isn't cliche. truth is that both films are cliche comic book movies and both are very entertaining. the major shortcoming of d.d. is that the directors cut was cut down and it's obvious that we missed quite a bit in the theatrical version. the directors cut will be better and i can't wait.
B000002H70|5.0|This is, without a doubt in my mind, The Cure's best album.  The haunting music is accentuated perfectly by Robert Smith's chilling vocals... and this makes for an extremely well-done piece of art.  I got this album simply because of Pictures of You, and well, all the other songs were just as perfect. <br /> <br />Personal Favorites.... Pictures of You, Lullaby, Prayers For Rain, Plainsong... Well, I pretty much like them all.  This album just washes over you... taking you to this little dark world created by The Cure.  I'd suggest listening to the full thing... but put aside a bit of time for it.  Don't be rushed or anything, just mellow out to the incredible musicial genius of The Cure.
B00003CXCT|5.0|To the poster below who urges viewers to see films by Sayles or Leigh INSTEAD of Starwars:   <br />Let me guess, you're a freshman in college who just read Nietzsche for the first time.  What a silly, pretentious review.  Sayles, Fellini, Goddard are great, but to compare the tone and subject matter of Starwars to Cries and Whispers, for example, is completely missing the point. <br /> <br />Starwars is GL's ode to Saturday matinees, flash gordon, and swashbuckling rogues w/ touches of myth, samurai warrior code and spaghetti westerns.  <br />NEWSFLASH:  movies are ALSO about having fun.  No films better represent the sheer exhilaration, wonderment and escapism of what movies are all about than the original starwars trilogy. <br /> <br />RE: Edits to the trilogy <br />If the reviews on Amazon are any indication, many die-hard SW fans are outraged by the alterations GL has made post-release.  While I sympathize w/ this viewpoint to some degree, I don't think the changes are significant enough to warrant the outrage.  Most of the changes are cosmetic (having little to do w/ the characters and grand scope of the story) and according to GL, would have been included in the original if not for the technical and logistical limitations. <br /> <br />The optimal solution would have been a release of the original movies along w/ the changes as extras on the DVD.  But either way, the trilogy remains a classic.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|At first, I couldn't stand \\"Somebody Told Me\\", a single I caught on the radio.  It was a bit too electricly pop for me... but I got this album when one of my friends practically forced me to buy it.  I am SO HAPPY that she did.  I listened to it reclucently, thinking it would all sound the same, like much of the mainstream... was I wrong or what?  Each song has its own unique favour, and each just captivated me.  I even caught myself singing along happily to \\"Somebody Told Me\\". <br /> <br />If you are looking to buy this album, I'd suggest you try to get the UK version.  The US release has the track \\"Change Your Mind\\" instead of \\"Indie Rock and Roll\\"... and \\"Indie RnR\\" is one of my absolute favourites.  Other favourites include \\"Midnight Show\\" and \\"Andy, You're a Star\\".
0930289234|4.0|One of the first modern day \\"graphic novels\\". Alan Moore humanizes the modern definition of super hero. His characters are not just caped crusaders but rather real people with problems both moral and commonplace. Dave Gibbons' art created a standard for the genre which continues today.
B00063MBU8|5.0|OMG When i first hear simple plan they were sooo amazing they was on scuzz.. and i fell in love straight away no pads was an excilent album it was the best ever... tehy when i heard they was bringing out a new album i was all up for it....

B000003TAR|3.0|<br />The ONLY good songs off In Utero are the radio singles and their b-sides, and this is coming from a guy whose favorite Nirvana albums are Bleach and Incesticide. In Utero is sickeningly sloppy. Sure, Bleach and Incesticide were raw and loud, both of which I love those albums for, but they were also crisp and clear despite the budget constraints. The In Utero is horribly muddy, and Albini couldn't do much to make the recordings clearer after Kurt chickened out and asked him to fix the sound. Yes, the recording was too muddy even for Kurt Cobain. It's hard to believe crap like \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" and \\"Tourettes\\" made the final cut, but they did.  <br />
B0002I831S|3.0|star trek, as a kid i never like it or watched it as my parents did. now im grown up and like it. so im watching it for the first time. i got the first season off e-bay (sealed) brand new. disc two skipped. i looked at the back of the disc. 2 scratches. effected play. but i guess not deep enough. it plays on my computer. but not the one hooked up to tv. so i checked all disc. no scratches on them. who ever packed them was'nt carefull in putting them in the case. for that kind of money they should. so i would advise people to check disc.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is a funny movie that is entertaining to watch. But Bush lovers bash this movie so much that it's getting annoying. It seems that you either love the movie or you hate it. Which is starting all these arguements. If you are a Bush lover, simply do not buy this DVD. You will only ***** and moan.
B000066C1N|5.0|BRYAM ADAMS SUCKS AT SINGING NO OFFENCE OR ANYTHING BUT HE DOES!!!!!!(THEY SHOULD FIND A NEW SINGER)
B00005JMUL|5.0|This is one of the best ground-breaking CGI animation film. It was so breath-taking. It had a very creative stroy to it. It was not a very predictible movie at all. Amazing how they made it. They really captured a unique style to the film. So it has a completely different style to it then Pixar films. When you take the director of Forest Gump and Castaway add Tom Hanks CGI animation a classic christmas picture book and you have a amazing film.A Must see this holiday season.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this cd is awesome, all there songs are awsome, if you dont have their cd, you need to get it. It is AWesoME.
B00063MBU8|5.0|When I purchased this album on October 29, 2004, I knew it would be great, but I didn't know just how great. Simple Plan knows how to write the perfect songs that pertain to real teenage life. I was going through some hard times with my best friend, and no.4 on the CD, \\"Thank You\\" was perfect and helped me to relax and calm down. Every one of their songs I can relate to, and I think they did an excellent job on this cd. Keep up the GREAT work!!!!
B0000542D2|5.0|In the wake of Beatlemania, the Beatles could just have very well made a quickie rock film of little substance to cash in on their success before the bubble burst.  The Beatles, smarter than that, did not want to make an \\"Elvis\\" movie.  They were in it for the long run and were looking at their legacy.  They contracted a top British playwright, Allen Owun, and hired a gifted director of comedies, Richard Lester, to craft what is probably the greatest rock 'n' roll movie and arguably one of the great screen comedies.  In addition, contributions are made by a great cast of British comics (Wilfred Brambell, Norm Rossington, Victor Spinetti).  With all these parts in place the question was whether could the Beatles themselves translate their lovable persona to the big screen.  The answer is a resounding yes!!!  Ostensibly, the story concerns the Beatles preparing for a television appearance in London while trying to simultaneously reign in Paul's mischievious grandfather.  Really, the film is about the Beatles mocking their own persona and Beatlemania in particular.  And what would the film be without great music.  The Beatles crafted a great new set of classic songs specifically for this film.  This film is still great forty years on so the Beatles obtained their objective.  And I suspect that one-hundred years on people will still be viewing this film and not just as a time-capsule curiousity.
B00005JMJG|5.0|There are so many things that stand out in this film, that it is hard to decide where to begin.  Charlie Kaufmann has again come up with a very original and intellectual script based on the inner workings of the mind.  The loops and circles of the story are wonderfully constructed and laid out in such a way to allow a very mysterious plot, and yet is not completly confusing.  Michael Gondry did an amazing job of directing this film, taking a very challenging script that could easily have been botched into a muddy mismash of confusion.  Instead, he weaves it together brilliantly, using fascinating effects, subtle visuals that allow new things to be discovered through every viewing, and symbolism that will keep your mind chewing for days. <br />Jim Carrey has succesfully proven that he is more than just a comical genius.  His portrayal of Joel Barish is very human and consistently believable and heartfelt.  He has finally been able to play a dramatic character and completely leave out any hints of his outrageous comic characters.  For him, I believe this is a spectacular performance. <br />This is a very well constructed, thought-provoking science fiction movie that harkens back to the original concepts of Sci-Fi.  It approaches the questions of humanity and fate with a new and original spin.  Kaufmann is truly one of the great writers of our time.  I also highly recommend Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.  I can not wait to see what his mind comes up with next.
B00000JGHM|5.0|\\"Heat\\" is one of the great films of the 1990's.  Michael Mann has crafted a film that is intricate and deliberately paced but never boring.  One of the best ensemble casts of all time has been assembled for this film and, for the most part, these are fully developed characters.  Central to this film are the main stars, Robert DeNiro as the thief, and Al Pacino as the detective out to catch him.  Though appearing together in only a couple of scenes, there is an intricate cat and mouse game played by these two adversaries and also a mutual respect.  Essentially these two individuals live by a code of their respective trades and their adherence to these codes lead to a lonely existence.  As previously stated, the large ensemble cast(Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, etc.) is excellent.  The highlight of the film is an elaborately staged bank heist and the subsequent getaway.  This film also has great editing, particularly in the above mentioned scene, great dusky cinematography of Los Angeles, and good music.
B00000IPAX|4.0|blink was at their best when they came out with the fun, energetic songs off of Dude Ranch,Enema of the State, and even TOYPAJ. the new album is a change to the band's music, and it isn't really effective for me. Now to a song by song review of this album:  <br />1)Dumpweed 8/10. Solid, energetic, fun opener <br />2) Don't Leave Me 8/10. Another great track. <br />3) Aliens Exist 9/10 Awesome guitar and great drums <br />4) Going Away To College 10/10. Best song on here. This song is good both lyrically and musically <br />5)What's My Age Again 7/10. It's hard not to like this song, no matter how many times you hear it <br />6)Dysentery Gary 5/10. One of the weaker tracks on this album. The lyrics are beyond juvenile <br />7)Adam's Song 9/10 A very sad song about suicide. Points added for some of the better lyrics on the disc <br />8)All The Small Things 7/10. Another catchy-but not great-song <br />9)The Party Song 6/10 The lyrics have a good message with some nice guitars on the verses. <br />10)Mutt 6/10 Another catchy song, but not great <br />11)Wendy Clear 7/10. I love the guitar on this song. A very upbeat, catchy song <br />12)Anthem 9/10. An awesome closer. One of the better songs on the album. <br />overall: 91/120, which comes out to about 3.79 stars. Pretty decent album from Blink
B00004RJ74|2.0|This film is exploitative trash and not in the good sense of the word.  There are three things that redeem this film from the trash heap of total worthlessness.  Harvey Keitel, even in a trashy enterprise like this, delivers a decent performance as a preacher who is grappling with his faith.  Even in junk like this Keitel didn't succumb to the urge to just phone it in.  Cheech Marin has an amusing bit as the strip club's barker.  Lastly, Salma Hayek's snake-dance.  Thank God for chapter search, otherwise, you would have to sit through the rest of this dreck to get to the good parts.  On a final note, Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the worst acting performances known to man.  This is no reflection on the sicko character that he plays, it's just unadulterated bad acting.  Tarantino is a great director but he is no actor.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I've been a fan of Simple Plan since their debut CD hit stores here in the US.  No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls (NPNHJB) was my all time favorite records....I listened to it so much that I had to go and buy a new one.  Now that Still Not Getting Any is out, I believe I have found a new favorite.  The sound of SNGA gives off a more \\"live\\" feeling...which is what the guys were looking for.  The songs are more diverse, and in my personal opinion, Simple Plan sounds better than ever!  From the upbeat songs like \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Jump\\" to the power ballads like \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Promise\\", the guys of Simple Plan have done it again!  They have captured what the average person feels in everyday life and has put it into song.  To ask me to choose a favorite song off of this album is impossible...but I highly reccomend you listen to \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Untitled\\".  Congratulations to Simple Plan on giving their fans another great record.  They definatly have the right to be proud of their hard work!  If you have the chance to see these guys in concert...I highly suggest you go!  You will have the time of your life!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Director Baz Luhrmann has crafted an enterprise that is dizzyingly energetic, at times incoherent, that either you will love it or hate it.  I for one enjoyed this ballet of borrowed musical source material, quick-cut editing, sumptuous art design and beautiful costumes.  This film is a true original and, yet, at it's core it is a story about a boy and a girl.  If Luhrmann didn't have a game cast this film would not have worked so kudos in particular to Ewan McGregor, one of our more underrated actors, and Nicole Kidman for being up to the challenge.  Jim Broadbent, as the master of ceremonies, gives an outstanding job here as well.  Many credit \\"Chicago\\" as the film that revitalized the movie musical, yet I will take \\"Moulin Rouge\\" over that pedestrian vehicle any day.
B0002I831S|4.0|I love the 1st season dvd box set. The only real problem I had with it is that they dont include the original pilot called \\"The Cage\\"
B00063MBU8|5.0|Are you a Simple Plan fan? There are a lot of people who are and a lot of people who aren't judging off of the band's debut \\"No Pads, No Helmets,...Just Balls.\\" A lot of people would probably judge them off of their trademark pop-punk sound and good looks but with their sophomore album \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" anyone can see there is much more. The 1st cd is among one of my favorites with songs that I can relate to being 14. It deals with your parents being there ruling over your life, crappy realationships, being a kid, and life just SUCKING! In \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" there are some of those characteristics brought back but there is also maturity where as a teenager and a young adult could both relate to. \\"Shut Up\\" deals with everyone trying to tell you how you should be and what you should do and you just feel like telling them to simply shut up because you don't care what they say...you wanna be YOU! Welcome To My Life explains how hard it is when your world just sucks and no one understands you even though they say they do. Perfect World deals with the loss of a love where Thank You deals with a loss of a friendship. Me Against The World however is their heaviest song I think yet. The guitars and drums are unbelievable where the lyrics are just as awesome. It is personally my favorite song on the album. Crazy talks about how our society is today. Everyone wants to be perfect and they'll do anything to acheive that goal...even if they never do and how no one cares about other people...only themselves. This song is probably the most meaningful and applies to our whole world. Jump is an awesome song that completely describes their concerts. The way I interpurret it it is saying that if you are having such a crappy time in life and every day just sucks and it's so frustrating that you just wanna go to a concert and jump like crazy, have fun, and forget about everything else. I know that it is one really good way to lose a lot of stress!! Everytime is probablyone of my other favorite songs of the whole cd. Being a teenage girl I like the cute little love songs but this is REALLY good! Pierre Bouvier sings about how much he loved a girl and everything they did together and she just walked away and he'd do anything just to have her back. It's like a really pretty, slower I'd Do Anything with Bouvier, Sebastien Lefebvre, and David Desrosiers all harmonizing beautifully. Promise talks about how crappy realationships might be but if you just stick together and work through the hard times then everything will be just fine and One discusses how people can just push you aside and treat you like crap when you really you mean something. Untitled is a really really pretty, slow, sad song about screwing up and everythings just wrong and you just think...What the heck happened? Overall this is one of the best cds that I own and even if you are not a Simple Plan fan then I suggest that you check it out still and listen to all of the songs because there is a variety and most definitely a musical progression from the last album. I would recommend this cd to anyone.
B00005JN4F|3.0|\\"Taxi\\" is the kind of movie that you feel was made in a day. It is definetly one hundred percent entertaining, but it isn't good. It has some funny moments, but that's about it. I liked Jimmy Fallon, though. If he doesn't pick such idiotic things to be in, he could be a pretty good actor. He could follow in the footsteps of Will Farrell, the man who has eleven movies on the slate to be made in the next two years. Queen Latifah had two hits, and now she's killing her career in such bad roles. \\"Bringing Down the House\\" and \\"Chicago\\" were both great movies, but now she's bringing HERSELF down to \\"Taxi,\\" and \\"The Cookout\\" which I also give three stars. The number one problem with this is that it never knew which direction it was going. It tried to cram every single cliche into it's nintety seven minute running time, including bloopers at the end to make it seem that the cast had such a great time shooting this movie. It had alot of pointless scenes, including the last scene at a NASCAR race, which Jimmy Fallon and anthor cast member Jennifer Esposito are dressed as Lord knows what because they are undercover. She is another actress that has high potential, but chooses movies that could bring her down, like \\"The Master of Diguise.\\" The special effects really aren't that great either, and it's obvious that the car crashes have been faked. Finally, I cannot stand the opening scene. There is somebody on a motorcycle, driving around town, jumping on trains, over a bridge, and finally she rips off her helment and its. . . Queen Latifah. It obviously wasn't her on the motorcycle, but we've seen that a million times, so it's nothing new. Just another cliche. <br /> <br />Jimmy Fallon stars as Officer Andy Washburn. He gets into a little trouble, since he is not so good at driving. He crashes into someone's fruit stand while undercover, and wrecks a few cars at the same time. His boss Marta, who also used to be his girlfriend, demotes him to a regular cop, but when he hears of abank robbery on the radio, he decides he must take action, considering he is only a few blocks away. He tries to get a car, but gets into more trouble, so he gets into a taxicab, run by Belle. She could get anywhere fast, and now she has this custom made cab, built for speed. They see the robbers, three Brazilian bank robbers who dress as men to rob banks. Of course, Belle can speak their language, because it was part of one of her jobs a long time ago. The police take Belle's cab as evidence, and now Washburn offers a deal with her. He will get her cab back, if she helps him foil the bank robbers, and get back into the clear at the office. She agrees. <br /> <br />\\"Taxi\\" is based on, I think, three French movies of the same name. Now, all you have heard from this is that I hated the movie, and yet I gave it three stars. That is, because it's entertaining. I had fun watching this, even though I've seen the same things over and over again. I laughed a few times, but it only merits a fair rating. Tim Story directed it, and he directed the fair \\"Barbershop,\\" but he missed out on the great \\"Barbershop 2 Back in Business.\\" I'm starting to think that maybe I don't like this guy as a director, and he should move onto better material. My advice: wait for the video and hope they don't make \\"Taxi 2.\\" <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated PG-13 for language, sensuality and brief violence.
B000667FN8|5.0|Well, if your a fan of Simple Plan, then your gonna want to get this (if you haven't already). And for the folks who even like 1 of their songs, your gonna want to get this too. This cd is ridiculously awesome. If you thought No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls, was good, this is a step up. I completely agree with the band when they said \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is a evolution towards their live sound. I saw them for the first time last nite in concert and it was crazy. Believe me, they aren't lying. The CD isn't one of those \\"all love song\\" CD's which really gets tiresome after while. This CD covers everything from what's going on in the world today with \\"Crazy\\" and the complex feelings when losing someone in \\"Perfect World\\", to fighting and standing up against those who try to keep you down in \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Me Against The World\\". The CD has a good amount of diverse songs on it. So the CD by itself is hands down... awesome. <br /> <br />On the other side of the CD is the DVD. This is not like a simple 15 minute footage of Simple Plan stuff. This is packed with all sorts of stuff. It has their album in 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, Lyrics to the album, Discography, A HUGE picture gallery of the band, wallpaper for the computer, weblink, and 20 minute making the record footage (and if you get it from Target, theres footage of when they were on tour earlier this year). So obviously, a CD and a DVD, oh yeah... this is a must have for anyone who has caught themselves nodding to \\"Addicted\\" or singing to \\"Perfect\\". Big up to Simple Plan... 5 stars all the way.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The thing is, this isn't really a sequal, but it is merely a continuation to what was unfinished in the first half. \\"Kill Bill\\" is all one movie, but based on the difference in content, it could be easily misunderstood that these are two different movies. I gave \\"Kill Bill Volume One\\" five stars, and called it one of the best of the year. I loved this movie, even better than the first part, and it is because of the content. At this point, I've seen this movie at least fifteen times, and everytime it doesn't seize to amaze me. It has some of the most insightful dialogue, the most amazing music, and the terrific acting of not one, not two, but four different people. Out of both of the movies, I found one scene in each that I could have lived without, and that is in four hours of material. Director Quentin Tarrantino has a way with words, and this movie completely proves that. <br /> <br />This part picks up right where the first one left off. Uma Thurman plays The Bride, or the Black Mamba. As the Black Mamba, she was one of the top assassins in the world, and she worked for Bill. She decides to leave the organization, The Deadly Viper Assassation Squad, and Bill is fine with it, until at her wedding, Bill and four other killers come in to crash the wedding. They kill all the quests, and shoot her in the head. She was also pregnant with Bill's child. She is left in a coma, wakes up, and starts her revenge. In the first part she gets to two of the killers, and now there are two left, and then to the big guy. . . Bill. She is faced to defeat Michael Madson, who plays Budd, and Daryll Hannah, who playes Elle Driver. She does face many problems along the way, including being buried alive by Budd, kicked, spit on, attacked, and emotionally hurt, especially by the shocker that takes place in the end. <br /> <br />I could understand why people wouldn't like \\"Kill Bill Volume Two.\\" Alot of people I know hated it compared to the first one. The first does have a bloody action climax, and this one only had about one major fight scene. This movie is very verbal, and it paves the way for much character development. In this movie, we are able to see the remaining killers as people, and a more in dept look at the wedding sequence. It takes about twenty-five minutes to get to The Bride's return, as we are treated to the social and working life of Budd. There is also a classic twenty minute scene showing the training of The Bride, shown in classic homage to the old Japanese movies.  <br /> <br />In recap, \\"Kill Bill\\" as one big movie is an great movie experience, but this \\"Vol. 2\\" works as a great substitute. It may not have the action that the first movie included, but this one is so much more memorable. Quentin Tarrantino also picks the best music to play in his movies, and this one is no exception. It was much more instramental, and it was darkly haunting. David Carradine steals the show in his scenes, and the final act, during his monolouges, he says his words in perfect pronouceation. I personally nominate him for Best Actor next year. \\"Kill Bill Volume Two\\" is one of the best movies of the year, close to the top. <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated R for violence, language, and brief drug content.
B00006CYAD|5.0|I've got the new CD &quot;Still not geting any&quot; and &quot;No pads no helmets just balls&quot; they are SOOOOO good. But I have to say that....the new CD is better. From the second album I put the songs I like are &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot;. The first one I like is &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; and &quot;Perfect World&quot; It really touches me. Oh yeah Pierre is hott!
B00063MBU8|5.0|All I have to say is that this CD is so good if you don't have it by now than you need to get up from your chair and go to your local record store and get it or get your mom's or dad's creidit card and order it from here! YES IT IS THAT GOOD! Simple plan never lets there fans down! They are the coolest band out there and coolest guys ever! SO take it from the BIGGEST SP fan get the CD you'll be happy you did!
0792840461|5.0|A sophisticated bank robber and an unscrupulous insurance investigator will be the central focus of this brilliant picture . Add some emotional tricks , smart verbal sparring , the presence of Steve Mc Queen and Faye Dunaway two potent icons of the sixties , the talented camera of Norman Jewison , a n extraordinarily well built script and the most erotic chess game ever made in the cinema story  and after that you will obtain one of the most gratifying movies in that decade .<br /><br />Norman Jewison confirms why he was one of the most innovative filmmakers in those ages when he decides to make a film with basic structures close to the Film Noir but with a handful of surprising twists along this clever film . He put elegance , refinement , eroticism , humor and cynicism and the mix was very successful . The last influences received from the European style specially Henri Verneuil in his film Any number can win are clear , but the seduction process in which investigator and thief are involved is carried with aristocratic style .<br /><br />A cult movie all the way
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's new CD Still Not Getting Any is the best CD out at the moment. Thye matured their music but not to the point that we don't know who they are anymore. They knew what they wanted and I think they got just that in this CD.
0312263120|2.0|This book is the Da Vinci code with the names and grail changed. <br />It has a beautiful but super intelligent heroine and some smart men around her with various infirmities of personality or physique and they all battle it out to get to the secret code before it all blows up and lets out some secrets of the US govt that have not already been leaked. Its rubbish writing, improbable plot and in the end you're sort of hoping they won't find the code and the billions spent on these corporate state secrets do get out into the much saner world outside the Digital Fortress. If you have ever wondered why Americans get it so wrong in foreign policy, the fact that this is considered a believable and well written book gives a clue.
B00063MBU8|4.0|Simple plans second cd is way better than the first cd (which was also a great cd) this cd is more mature though. its more about relationships and real problems...not 20 year olds singing about being picked on in school. here is my breakdown of all the songs. <br /> <br />Shut Up: 3/5.. The instruments and vocals are great . but the chourus gets a little repetitive. <br /> <br />Welcome To My Life:  4/5..  Great song deserved to be a single but a little overplayed now. <br /> <br />Perfect World:  5/5.. I love this song. the lyrics are so meaningful, David and Seb did a great job on the background vocals <br /> <br />Thank You:  4/5.. Good song... great chorus <br /> <br />Me Against The World:  5/5.. Great song, pretty hard, cool lyrics great intro. <br /> <br />Crazy:  5/5.. Great song about real issues going on in this world.. makes you really stop and think. <br /> <br />Jump: 0/5.. The worst simple plan song ever.. Maybe the worst song by any band ever. no meaning.. just skip it. thats the only reason this cd got 4 stars and not 5 <br /> <br />Everytime:  10/5.. My fav. song on the album.. One of the best Simple plan songs by far. very mature.. very sweet <br /> <br />Promise:  5/5.. Great relationship repair song..great vocals by Pierre. <br /> <br />One:  5/5.. Good song.. a really live sound to it. it's great. <br /> <br />Untitled:  9/5.. My second fav. song on the album. Pierre sounds great and its the perfect ending to a great cd.
6305291446|4.0|I think this was one of  the best Halloween movies. Jamie Lee Curtis runs rampid....not in the hospital, but all around! it wasnt really scary, but it was funny and good.If you love Jamie Lee, then dont see Halloween Reserection... its really bad since JLC dies in the first 5 minutes....
B000002VDW|5.0|To a certain extent, it's not that surprising that certain fans will somewhat write this album off, being as it was, along with \\"Year Of The Cat\\", Al's commercial peak--in the US, the album reached the Top Ten on the album charts & went platinum within a year of its original release in September/ October of 1978.  Granted, Al has lots of excellent work from before as well as after this album, yet \\"Time Passages\\" demonstrates a genius at an absolute peak.  Al's songwriting on track after track is so melodically rich & full of outstanding, incisive lyrics, it's hard not to be envious of his ability.  Also, his understated, precisely-phrased, clearly enunciated vocals complement the material perfectly.  As much credit as Al deserves, you can't deny the contributions of producer Alan Parsons for the album's lush, warm sound, & all the great musicianship, including guitarist Peter White who co-wrote the beautiful, timeless title track (& the final track--everything in between was written by Al himself).  Some fans seem to find the sound of the album too bland/ soft-rockish/ radio-friendly, which is being very harsh.  His folkier side is very much represented on \\"Timeless Skies\\" and \\"Almost Lucy\\", the latter of which is one of his patented 'mysterious woman' songs.  Maybe it WAS radio-friendly for its time, but listening today it sounds arguably even more impressive than when first released in the sense that there's none of the overdone, overly slick, lifeless production that's heard all too frequently on much 1990s/ 2000s music.  The album is so rich & complete--you could go on at length discussing the individual tracks...  The thing that really drives it all home making the album so extra-special is the emotional resonance of the material--the majestic title track, \\"Timeless Skies\\" (with a great \\"rainy\\" acoustic guitar part), and the relaxed \\"Song On The Radio\\" are all wistful, breezy, and wonderful; the haunting story-song \\"Almost Lucy\\" is also a terrific, deeply affecting track.  \\"The Palace of Versailles\\" with its great synthesizer melody, & the punchy uptempo rocker \\"Valentina Way\\" are a couple more gems from the album.  Al said in an interview over 20 years ago he doesn't expect listeners to fully understand his often historically-based lyrics, and that some of it elludes even himself.  Having attended a Stewart concert this past June, playing solo with acoustic guitar, his humbleness is readily apparent, and as much as he clearly enjoys piling in the little details into his lyrics for the fans who love trying to decipher it all and to point out any historical inaccuracies, he is overwhelmingly effective in his attempts to communicate feeling.  This album was reissued on CD by Rhino Records in April of 2004, and it's preferrable to this older Arista CD release; however, if you already have this version or if you see it cheap, it will get you by just fine since the sound quality here is solid in its own right and the Rhino reissue doesn't feature any bonus tracks.  If you're new to Al, this is a great album to start with--this is one of those truly special albums that belongs in any serious listener's collection.
B00009V7P8|5.0|What can I say? This is one of my favourite albums. It did take a bit of listening to get into it, as it's very mellow and you've got to be in the right mood. But it grew on me very quickly and now I can't stop listening to it! All of the songs on this album are absolute gems but my favourites are Cannonball, Amie, Volcano, Cold Water... ALL of them, in fact! ^___^ This is going to be a classic.
B000002HRE|1.0|<br /> <br /> This album is ::Expletive deleted::. Don't buy it.
0553213105|5.0|This book is truly good literature with two other advantages:<br /><br /> 1.  You can enjoy reading it at the beach<br /><br />2.  If you are studying for the GRE's or SAT's, the vocab will get you halfway there.<br /><br />I adore this book.  I think it the best of Austen's work.  It is a book you will go to again and again.
B000002A46|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out and it's still my favorite after all these years.  She is at her best on this CD.  A winner that is sure to please!
B00005NRO3|5.0|This movie was great, i belive it was the best of the series. They brought in my obsession, Sarah Michelle Gellar to play the roll Cici Cooper. She was great, but i cried wen she died... :( hehehe. Courtny Cox and Neve Camble were funny too! if you love seeing the best scream queens (like SMG) run rampid, then go out and buy Scream 2!
0811806405|5.0|I have been repairing guitars for nearly 15 years, and successfully completed several electric guitars, yet had not attempted an acoustic instrument.  I have found this book to be an outstanding resource to me as a luthier, with a level of detail and thoroughness seldom seen in books of this kind.  Often the author is too familiar with the subject to realize that they have left out critical details which are obvious to them by merit of experience, but without which a beginner is lost.  Mr. Cumpiano's attention to detail helps a seasoned craftsman to achieve professional results, but he always manages to offer a simpler approach to each procedure for the beginner to more easily grasp.  I hope he is inspired to write a sequel!
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is so disturbing. Its classic, but very disturbing. I love that this was based on a dozen (or more) true stories too, that makes it even scarier than it already is. Everyone knows about the possessed girls head turning 360 degrees and basically every other disturbing thing, so I wont say anything about the scrae factor. This movie is just plain creepy, it will haunt your dreams for days on end, it'll make you go to church every Sunday so the devil won't get you. This definately is NOT, I repeat: NOT for the casual movie fan/critic. This is for people with nerves of steel and iron stomachs. I recommend this for the experienced horror fan/critic ONLY.
B000002IM7|5.0|This first of the four 'must have' King's X albums is their debut release.<br /><br />I bought this album virtually when it came out, and it is one of the best purchases I ever made. In an entire evening of watching 'Headbanger's Ball', I only saw one band that seemed different to all the Bon Jovi's/Slayer's/Warrant's/Poison's/Judas priest's etc. of the time, that were played in constant rotation. I saw King's X's ''King'', and though it was the second release ''Shot of Love'' that actually made me run down to the store to buy this album in 1987, I liked what I was seeing for a number of reasons.<br /><br />1) King's X have an amazing vocalist named Doug Pinnick.<br /><br />2) They were an interracial band in a world full of hairsprayed, mid-80's glamrockers.<br /><br />3) Their guitarist played with 'soul', but was as good as the Yngwie Malmsteen's of the day.<br /><br />4) They took elements from The Beatles / Jimi Hendrix / Sly and the Family Stone / Black Sabbath / Stevie Wonder, and made something very brand new out of all this.<br /><br />I had found the band I was waiting for.<br /><br />When I first played this King's X album to my friends, they had no clue what I was playing them, but I insisted this was the best band out there, forget about Guns & Roses, who were just making waves at this point. Pinnick could outsing most of the heavy metal hairpsray boys in a heartbeat. But it wasn't that. It was the sheer quality of their songs, and this unexplained energy that was happening in them. Whether this was the production of Sam Taylor, or a combination of Tabor/Gaskill/Pinnick and where they were at the time, Out of the Silent Planet is one of the most influential hard rock albums of its time. When Pearl Jam made waves in 1990 with 'Jeremy' from 10, I sat pretty amazed that this band was having huge success with what was, in sound and design, King's X with Eddie Vedder singing instead. Pearl Jam emerged 3 years after King's X's debut, and even though their formation started with Mother Love Bone, by 1990, Pearl Jam sounded like King's X. and had more success with it. That I never understood at all.<br /><br />An actual influx of bands came out around this time that took King's X's sound and had a great deal of success with it, but King' X lurked somewhere on the borders of commercial success.It was infuriating. Here was a band that influenced quite a number of musicians, that couldn't get the time of day, until 1990's ''It's Love'', and by that time many were sounding like King's X enough to make it sound as if King's X were joining their own bandwagon. The first album alone defines the King's X sound between 1987 - 1992. Definitive years for a definitive band.<br /><br />Another tag that gets associated with King's X is the Christian one. And I can honestly tell you I never ran to church after listening to their albums. The thought never crossed my mind. They had something far greater than just the excuse to quote the commandments or moralise. There was something mystical in their songs, and their live concerts were almost Revivalistic in energy. They had that much power. This changes after 1994's Dogman, but the first 4 albums are full of this certain type of energy that made me think King's X were one of the greatest bands I ever heard.<br /><br />This album needs remastering, as it is mixed a bit low compared to today's standards, and I hope the band's efforts to convince Atlantic to remaster their catalogue are fruitful.<br /><br />All 10 tracks are standouts. It's just the whole vibe the band puts on to these tracks that doesn't make just one person stand out over the other two. This is a band in all manner of the word. A must have album. It made me a fan of theirs for the past 17 years.started with Mother Love Bone, by 1990, Pearl Jam sounded like King's X. and had more success with it.

B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan has always been one of my favorite bands and their new cd keeps them right at the top of my list. Their songs are really catchy and make you want to listen to them all day. The whole album is really great. There is not one song that I don't like. I love the whole thing. also, the dual-disc 'making of the record' part is really great. It allows you to see all the hard work and effort they put into making 'Still not getting any...' great for all of their fans. I would seriously recommend buying Simple Plan's new cd to any one no matter how old you are, or how much you like Simple Plan.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Neal's first solo effort since he became a Christian is awesome. Muscically and lyricly, it's simply awesome. But. beware, it is a CHRISTIAN album. It's concept can't be tampered with because it is about Neal's life-not ours. If you are not a Christian, it's likely that you won't understand the concept fully. If you are Jewish, and a Christian message bothers you (as a Christian, I believe in religious freedom, and a Jewish message doesn't bother me) then don't buy the record, and don't take a swing at Neal or tell him what to do because he believes in something you don't. I know many non-Christians who say that songs like 'I Am Willing' and 'Sleeping Jesus' are beautiful. <br /> <br />But if a Christian message doesn't bother you, by all means, this is a great album. Absoluteley incredible on all levels. The most amazing thing is that Neal wrote all the music himself, and played the guitar (with guest Kerry Livgren), bass, and sang lead all by himself. At times the music reminds me of Kansas, but mostly it's like Spock's Beard. This record is definately my favorite listen at the moment (along with King's X 'Faith Hope Love'). Hope this helps.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Wow!!! , after albums like fly on the wall and blow up your video (although heatseeker rocks) ACDC fans were in doubt. Some people said that this album showed life yet in ACDC, It shows more than life. First of all, it contains arguably ACDC's best song ever, thunderstruck. It is also the best song ever created by man. It also has several more of ACDC's concert staples, fire your guns, moneytalks, are you ready, and the great razor's edge. 3 best songs: thunderstruck, fire your guns/mistress for christmas (these two are eqaully amazing) and moneytalks. worst song: good bye and good riddance to bad luck. This one isnt bad, but is probably filler. Great effort ACDC, can't wait for the new album Strap it on  in 2005. peace
0783225849|5.0|I'll first say that if it wasn't for this movie then we wouldn't have many other great horror films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (the original people, not that horrible remake), HALLOWEEN, or THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. This was also one of the first movie's to actually use a person in a monsters situation instead of just a monster. Alfred Hitchcock does a wonderful job of explaining of how the psycho lived. Its also even better that the psycho... wait, I shouldn't say that becuase I would reveal like half the movie to you. This, as a scary movie, is okay, but as an interesting work of art, is marvelous. There is also very little blood/gore in here, so its all about terror, and that takes a lot for a movie to do. This is definately an amzing horror movie and is well worth your money. Trust me, it's worth it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I was already a huge Simple Plan fan with their first CD and I couldn't wait for another to come out. Now that Still Not Getting Any is out I am an even huger fan :) The guys are great and they prove it with their talent on this album. I recommend the songs Welcome To My Life and Perfect World. Those are my two favorite songs so far but the whole CD is awesome :) It's a must!
B0002ZMITY|2.0|this film is generic&pretty much shows Ali G as One demensinal overall.the show on Hbo is hit&Miss with me on a whole. this film just basically is just kinda there.not much happening with it. in other words what works for Tv doesn't work for the Big screen&this is the case here.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I've had a copy of \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" for a week now, and I think it is just wonderful! All of the songs are really cool, and their sound, while still original, has improved greatly. The quality of this album is phenomenal. I absolutely Love this band and I can't wait to listen to this cd over and over again! If you haven't already, get out there and buy it! It's well worth it. ^_^ ~Amy
B000002JS6|5.0|ACDC has shown the world its heart stopping talent in previous albums like High Voltage, let there be rock, highway to hell. But honestly, why do so many people dislike Brians singing? It suits the style of music they play more than Bon's ever did(although I loved Bon's voice) This album showed all those punks and metal heads what real music is. Not a bad track here. Not even close. The best 3 songs: Hells bells, Back in black , you shook me all night long. the worst song: givin the dog a bone. Givin the dog a bone is by no means a filler, it is displays some monstrous riffs and a chorus that you can't rid your mind of. All the songs in between are fantastic. overall: arguable ACDC's best album, some say highway to hell is better, but look at this master piece.
B0002234LS|3.0|The main attribute of this film is the performance of Johnny Depp as the beleaguered writer.  He is recovering from a divorce (he found his wife in bed with another man) when John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up on his doorstep and accuses him of plagiarism.  Shooter turns out to be psychotic.  It should be easy enough to prove Shooter wrong, but he has a way of destroying everything - and everyone - that gets in his way.  Soon, it seems Shooter is too powerful to be a normal human being. <br /> <br />I am familiar with the novella this is based on - it is one of Stephen King's more modest efforts.  The movie takes great liberties with the plot, so even if you are familiar with it, you will be surprised.  I have to say I prefer the ending of the movie to the ending of the book.  I was expecting a typical Hollywood ending, but the film turned it into something much different.  It is the Depp performance that makes everything work. <br /> <br />I am not a huge fan of writer/director David Koepp, but he does seem to have good taste in horror fiction (he also filmed Richard Matheson's Stir of Echoes).  Let's hope he continues the trend of making good horror movies. <br />
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Dire Straits this isn't.  When I heard and read the reviews both by TV commercial as well as written reviews, I waited in eager anticipation for this 4th Knophler solo album.  They said Shangri-La was like Dire Straits, and MAN where they full of it! <br /> <br />  A few songs do sound as if they were rejects from the Dire Straits album \\"On Every Street\\".  I mean if you took the songs: \\"Boom Like That\\" and \\"Song For Sonny Liston\\" and tacked them onto a remaster of that Dire Straits album, few people would notice. <br /> <br />  I know I shouldnt compare Mark Knopflers solo stuff with the great classic rock band Dire Straits. But hey! It is Knopflers promo people that started all this. If they think they are gonna sucker a hard core Dire Straits fan of 25 yrs into buying Shangri-La like it were D.S. (they should do themselves a favor and think about finding a new line of work).  Cause I ani't buying this! <br /> <br />  Tell you what folks.  Do yourself a favor,  Wait till your local library gets a copy of M. K.'s 4th solo album (by donation), then take it out and copy it.  If you can't wait that long to hear it, you can buy a USED COPY here at Amazon for far less than $16.00-$20.00.  Amazon has already got about 100 used copies of Shangri-Blah (and to think this is a recent release!!). <br /> <br />Go Figure! <br /> <br /> <br />This album gets 3 stars for: <br />\\"Boom Like That\\" and  <br />\\"Song For Sonny Liston\\" <br />(enough said) <br /> <br />
0060512806|2.0|He writes well about - nothing.  If a sitcom could become a mega-hit, perhaps this plot-less novel could do.  Only problem is, its over a thousand pages looooonnnnnnggggg, and I'm only on page 250.  Help!  Make me stop!
B000002JS8|5.0|This was my first ACDC album and is probably my second favorite to back in black. It, like back in black, is fillerless and is never boring. Bon's last album, and he saved his best singing for his last, he is insane here. best 3 songs: highway to hell ( what a memorable riff), if you want blood (angus at his best), touch too much/girls got rythm ( these two are eqaully ridiculous and amazing). worst song: love hungry man. this is one of their more melodic songs and is a great song. I love the chorus. Over all , great ( in my opinion) the second greatest album ever.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this CD so much, I listen to it everyday.  The 2 last songs are great for being a punk-rock band to go and do those 2.  This is one of those CDs that you can put it in and listen to every song on it and never have to skip even one.  It's great how it has the more faster sogns at the beginning of the CD and the slower ones at the end, organized in a good manner.  This CD even comes with a DVD on the other side, some might have come a 2-disc feature instead of one.  Simple Plan is the greatest.
6305014140|4.0|Similar to its Samurai predecesors Ninja Scroll is all about style and pays very little attention to the plot. That's not necessarily a bad thing though; next to animes like Cowboy Bebop and Akira Ninja Scroll is among the most stylish of series. While Cowboy Bebop is infinitely stronger in plot and is equally a stylish, making it perhaps a stronger series, I have a genuine soft spot for Ninja Scroll's Samurai/Ninja elements. (Also similar to Cowboy Bebop) You have a hybrid of time periods; combining elements of the traditional Samurai flick with futuristic cyber-enemies and magic powers that render the dueling/battling both incredible and amazing.<br /><br />Scroll, the protagonist, is Japan's greatest swordsmen, wielding unfathomable power that can slice virtually anything in two with a little more than the twitch of his wrist. He embodies all that we love about the typical Ronin (wandering masterless Samurai) - he's a loner, he's funny and, dag dabbit, he's a bad-ass. I often find that the enemies steal the spotlight. Every enemy that is throw at Scroll is bigger, badder and uglier than the previous. While the baddies often adhere to an anime mold (the quiet guy that chuckles all the time, the insane hairy guy, the shrieking femme fatale, etc) they are nonetheless very original and I always find myself looking forward to see what enemy will come lurking out the shadows next. From half-naked ladies with small gremlins crawling out their bodies, to snakemen, to beastmen, to vampires, to see-through blue [...] with blue flames for intestines; there is never a dull moment on the battlefield.<br /><br />While the plot's weak (a young-common-girl-who's-super-powerful-but-she-doesn't-know-it-yet named Shiyu finds out she's being hunted down by ungodly evil doers she finds protection from Scroll and together they seek out her destiny before she is captured), the animation itself is to die for. The characters are cool, sexy and hilarious and, on rainy saturday nights, it's that much better than re-runs of SNL.er than re-runs of SNL.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Very few times while watching a movie I can sense that this movie is more than it appears to be.  When this film first came out I predicted it would be a cult film, and lord and behold it is.  The movie is moody, weird, funny, scary, touching--sometimes at the same time.  The plot is complex, yet simple.  The acting is top notch, yet effortless.  The direction is slick, fast and fresh, yet subtle.  A lot is left to the imagination, yet a lot is spelled out clear.  There are a lot of twists along the way, and the rollercoaster ride is fun indeed. <br />Its artsy fartsy meets David Lynch.  One hellova film.
0142000663|1.0|I like steinbeck.  i really do.  east of eden was wonderful.  every other book i have read by him was good.  however, this book is a waste of time.  the people in the places he wrote about were insulted, and i don't blame them.  my family were farmers(not in that area).  i guarentee that they read, write, and do not get put in jail.  they actually use proper english(gasp of astonishment).  and they have shoes(does that blow your mind?).  that said, this book makes a powerful statement about the time it was written, but i can't get past the characters.  i cannot force myself to like tom joad, or the nasty preacher. any comparison to christ is just disturbing.  maybe the mark of a good writer is to push the envelope, but i don't care to read a book written just for that purpose.  good books are honest, and i simply don't believe this one is.  also, look how long it is.  as an added discouragement, my religion teacher likes this book.  so to me that is another reason to avoid it.  one last word about farmers.  farmers are some of the best people in the world.  and they are not stupid.  and there are people who believe in God and actually act the right way.  granted, a lot of people don't.  but i am sick of all this one big united spirit garbage.  and people think Christians are stupid for believing in God.  you want something stupid, look at this transcendalism garbage.  when are people going to stop saying something is beyond them when it is really below them?
0131177052|5.0|As a software coach, Michael has had to figure out how to work with a great many, um, suboptimal code bases -- and here's his experience all nicely packaged up for the rest of us. There are some neat techniques, such as the diagrams he sketches to help him understand disorganised classes, and a good catalog of patterns for somehow coping with that Big Ball of Mud you've just inherited. As with the best patterns, they all look familiar, but now they have names and you have a very respectable book to help you justify actually doing something about your situation. He also covers C++, which very few of the Agile community are prepared to deal with. One minor quibble is that there are no references -- but maybe that's what Amazon is for nowadays.
B0000399WC|3.0|Back in the first half of the 1970s, many of the movie blockbusters were based on airport novels that were even more popular than the movie. Henri Charriere, Mario Puzo and Arthur Hailey come to mind. Sometimes the adaptation worked brilliantly -- particularly for the GODFATHER series -- but I don't feel that PAPILLON succeeds on the big screen.<br /><br />The pace is unusual. Most of the excitement comes from McQueen recreating his role as Hiltz in THE GREAT ESCAPE, or almost. But two-thirds of the way in, the action is nearly all over, when McQueen finds a coastal paradise with topless women. Resolution of the entire story is strangely feeble, as it is left to a narrator to tell us that McQueen eventually made it to freedom on his coconut raft.<br /><br />Two things perplexed me:<br /><br />1. How did the prisoners' economy function? We see the prisoners handing over large bribes to the prison staff, but we never see how the prisoners acquire more money. New arrivals and the recently guillotined would seem to be the only feasible source of capital inflow.<br /><br />2. While on the sea, we see Hoffman having part of his gangrenous leg amputated, as a result of an untreated fracture. But by the end of the film, Hoffman seems to have a full complement of feet and he is barely hobbling.<br /><br />The wide-screen DVD is well remastered, despite the mono soundtrack. But overall, the story adaptation isn't sufficiently well done for most people to want to watch it more than once very five years, say.
B00063MBU8|5.0|every single song on this cd is just awesome. for any simple plan fan out there or anybody else that likes a good cd, you should definitely buy this cd. it is so worth it.
0393316041|4.0|people who are considering this book, please realize anyone can read it.  it is the best nonfiction book i have ever read which may not be impressive because i generally read fiction.  however, this book is not a lecture on the universe or anything.  instead it is more about feynman and what he thinks.  if you are an engineer i think you will like this book.  feynman is a real person.  sagan drives me crazy.  it is so philosophic.  this is more a collection of stories.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan has come out with an AMAZING new album.  The songs are incredible, and \\"Untitled\\" is so good I cried the first time I listened to it! (emotional, I know, but it's THAT good). Everyone should have this album, it's one you just can't stop listening to!
B000002USN|3.0|It is not the best of Sinatra, but quite remarkable that he could still sing close to his eighties. Some of the partners are legends by themselves, so it`s a chance to keep something that will become history as years go by
B00005A46T|4.0|Slipknot Ae a gud band no materr what people say this album lacks the clomplexity of the other two albums but all the same the lyrics are great so is the guitaring and everything else but the majour problem is that the words cant be heard very well meaning you need to listen hard so people will just shunt it off. I pitty you.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I found this SNGA (w/Dvd) well very good. I can relate to the music as well as the lyrics, I love how they have the dvd about the making of the record. But the only thing I dislike is the dualdisc thing they have going on.
0767830555|1.0|Scorsese grew up amidst violence and bloodshed.  That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star.  The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning.  A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as \\"enlightened\\" cinephiles make it out to be.
0765301598|3.0|This book is only for the hard core addicts. It's a series book so it only works if you have read the previous books. As with the others this book is a prequel to the original books. The thrust of the series is to provide back story on the various factions in the original book; Fremen, Bene Gesserit, Guild, Mentats, Corrino, Atriedes, Harkonnen, etc. This book does not fail there. I found the Guild the most interesting, but that's just my own opinion. <br /> <br />The stories are woven into a fairly uneven story about the destruction of the machine worlds. It's divided into to parts, each with an independent climax that, in both cases, neglects some of the characters almost completely. <br /> <br />It's easy to see how this book is drawing parallels to our present situation. In particular the Bush administrations war in Iraq. That's an interesting, if simplistic, side of the book. <br /> <br />The entire series of Brian Herbert Dune books is written very different from the original Dune masterpiece. The language is less sharp, the characters less cleanly drawn and more two-dimensional.  <br /> <br />These are fun light reads though, particularly for those Dune addicts out there who can't get enough of seeing the names of their favorite houses n print.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is one of those rare albums that many can relate to and is not to be taken for granted. This is slipknot first album as a nine as the first album only had five of the existing members. The album has real complexity in it without having any crapy songs and all being good. Although this album is only worth having if you can really appreciate the words and the layers of music. As some find this album and band strange. Not me ive seen them live and they need to be seen to be believed, belive the storys a new breed has arrived.
0312263120|2.0|After reading some of the reviews for the book I feel I must sdd one small bit of information. This book was written in 1997 when the internet was still the \\"Information Super-Highway\\" that everyone was \\"surfing.\\" The book talks of the greatness of Netscape! Just remember that it is dated and is not even close to comparing with the D Code. Take it for what it is, a semi entertaining book that will not kill many brain cells by reading it.
B00005JL78|5.0|I was stunned when I first saw this film in the theater, and enjoy it immensely every time I pop in the DVD.  Visually captivating with its grainy footage, washed out colors, and delightful visual motifs, \\"Minority Report\\" makes up for any plot holes with sheer visual brilliance. Next to \\"Schlindler's List,\\" perhaps Spielberg's greatest achievement.
B000002B7O|5.0|I got this on cassette and then quickly sold it to my friend. After hearing it several times at his house I realized I should have kept it so I got another copy. I think the sound on this album is much better than Blizzard even though the band apparently wanted more time in the studio. Randy's guitar is simply scorching! Especially on Over The Mountain (great drums and solo), Flying High Again (great riff and solo), S.A.T.O.(great solo), and the title track (haunting). You Can't Kill R&R and Tonight are beautiful songs with emotional vocals from Ozzy. Believer is the only song I don't care for but it has some interesting guitar at the end. Don't bother with the latest version of Diary where the original bass and drum tracks were re-recorded. You can't top bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake's performance (who were quickly replaced by Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo after the original album was finished, by the way). Those two have gotten screwed over twice!! Abominog by Uriah Heep is another great album featuring Daisley and Kerslake.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I must addmit i was blown away when i first heard this but eventuall i realised that this wasn't what slipknot was about. the lyrics were the same sort of thing but corey i fell left out whats going out you sound very different and i cant tell weather i like it or not but for now this is a well put together album so good luk on the new approach to music. these songs are way better live when preformed with slayer as back up         slipknot an slayer was ace live i went.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I laughed so hard at this lame attempt of a movie, my sides hurt at the end. The writting, was as if a cliche' marylin manson fan wrote it, and the visual effects [cgi] made it more cheesy. Was this suppose to be a serious movie?!? Or to just entertain the easily entertained. The acting from Hugh Jackman wasn't much of a streach from X-Men. Kate Beckinsale was casted into this movie, and she was a fish out water through-out the movie it was a waste of her actuall talent. Atleast Underworld was more serious than this piece of cr*p. This movie was made in hopes to try to flock the people who like eye candy. Blech, to you stephen somers, and to your mindless movie!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I finally found the time to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 and I must say BRAVO Michael Moore. I read a number of reviews before I made my way down to the local video shop to pick up a copy. To all those that claim that this movie was a waste of time; you must all live in a bubble.  <br />Mr. Moore was not afraid of telling and proving to the world what really happened after George W. Bush was elected in 2000, could 9/11 have been stopped? Who knows, Mr. Bush is the only one who really knows what the documents he \\"overlooked\\" had in them.  <br />To all the Americans that have lived and loved G.W. Bush and proudly stand behind the \\"so called president\\" ...and hope the next 4 years gives you the strength to realize that he has been playing to country like a puppet. My heart goes out to all the families that have lost a life to a war that was NEVER needed.  <br />For those who still believe G.W. Bush is the ideal president for the next 4 years, I suggest you watch the movie with a parent/spouse/a child who has lost a loved one to this stupid war!  <br />
B000059R8Y|5.0|I would take issue with those who feel Reptile is a dud. Different, yes, but who really wants an artist who turns out the same music with every cd? The guitar work is excellent and his vocals show a maturing artist. Great blues and soul. Billy Preston is a welcome addition.  What more could you ask for on a Sunday morning?  If you want to hear his guitar scream on every song there are plenty of other Clapton albums to listen to.  Reptile offers an alternative that to this listener is very welcome.  To denegrate this cd because you can't put it in a particular category is a little silly. The Man can do everything, slow or fast, it's all great. Elevator music - ridiculous. For one, I consider this an essential addition to Clapton's already substantial body of work.  It is what separates Clapton from other great guitarists, such as Jeff Beck, whose guitar work is super, but whose music is one dimensional and a little tiring after awhile.  Clapton, does in fact, rule.
B00068IOWM|5.0|This band never ceases to amaze me.  They have taken their years of expeirence and talent and wrapped it up nicely inside this  bomb about to explode into everyones minds. <br />Love and Peace or Else is one of the single heaviest songs I've ever heard from U2 and City of Blinding Lights is a materpiece. <br />Original of the Species and All Because of you incorporate clear sounds and influences from their past.  This is one of those rare albums where every track is well worth the money. Adam Clayton on bass has never sounded better, Bono sings with passion and renewed spirit The Edge has cloned himself along with some additional guitars and Larry Mullen Jr.on drums is simply awesome. Don't miss this one... The entire album is U2 putting this story of their life to music. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's new CD is absolutely amazing! It doesn't matter in what mood you are in, you will find a song on this album that will either make you feel better or that will make you jump. Everyone can relate to the songs on this album and I think it's the best thing an artist can accomplish. I truly admire these guys. They are such great role models and I think a lot of people could learn from them.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|slipknot man they  suck I have to say im sorry there just not very creative same retarded lyrics blah blah im mad go see a shrink.........
B00006S041|5.0|If you are looking to buy the best of him, this is the disc you need to have.<br /><br />You more needed to start.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I hate the way some people always judge bands so much.  I know so many people are against \\"pop-punk\\" bands and that there is so much controversy about what is \\"real punk\\" and what's not but I only have one thing to say about it all...I'M BLOODY SICK OF ALL THIS TALK!  I like a band because I enjoy listenning to their music and I like their sound, not because it's \\"cool\\" or because it belongs to a certain genre.  Althought I am a fan of pop-punk and I'm not afraid to say it.   <br /> <br />I believe in my own mind that it is punk, but just the new punk.  No-one is trying to compare it to those people's \\"precious sex pistols!\\"  GET OVER IT YOU GUYS, this is the new music so just get used to it ok, and you most certainly don't have to like it for all we care.  This is what a lot of us teens like nowadays and we are proud of it, it's funky, not too deep, has a cool sound and most of all, we can relate to it!!!   <br /> <br />That's the most important aspect, when I listen to any of my Simple Plan, Yellowcard, Good Charlotte, Sum41 (you get the idea of my tastes now! LOL) I like the way I get what they are getting at with their tracks and that's one of the reasons I enjoy it.  SO IN THE END, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE HELL YOU WANNA CALL THE MUSIC OR THE BANDS, the main thing is I LIKE IT!  end of story old sex pistol fans...........
B00063MBU8|5.0|Rather than continue on with the happy, spunky songs that are found on the first CD \\"No Pads, No Helmet...Just Balls,\\" Simple Plan has taken the opportunity to show that they can write lyrics that are meaningful (not that the first ones weren't) and mix them with great instrumentation. The new CD \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" contains many great songs, most of which say things that matter and might possibly make a difference to a lot of people. This CD is a perfect example of- in this case- musicians that prove they can grow and change their direction somewhat but never actually change themselves or their overall style. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be known for having good taste in music.
0783225849|5.0|Last night I learnt that a late-night movie by Alfred Hitchcock was on.  The only other Alfred Hitchcock movie I ever saw was Birds which I greatly enjoyed so I decided to stay up and watch it.  I'm glad I did.  <br /> <br />Firstly the movie introduces us to the love affair between Marion Crane(Janet Leigh)and Sam Loomis(John Gavin). They talk about marriage but the amount of green between them stops those thoughts from taking action.  When she returns to work a sprendrift man comes in and literally pulls out 40 thousand in cash and puts it under Miss Crane's nose. When asked to deposit the hefty sum in the bank she sees an opputunity to live as Mrs. Loomis without much worry for money, so she runs.  <br /> <br />After being stalked by a suspicious cop and buying a new car the embezzeler on the run takes the advice of the before-mentioned cop and stops at a motel instead on the side of the road or something. <br /> <br />Miss Crane chooses to spend the night at Bates Motel off the old highway under the name of Marie Samuels.  The manager of the motel Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), pays every attention to his only, and very attractive customer.  We learn of his overbearing mother and his interest in taxidermy.  <br /> <br />Then the fun begins.  Janet Leigh or as we know her Marion Crane goes down in film history as the best slasher victim ever to grace the silver screen.  And the shower scene has come no where close to being duplicated by another. When Norman Bates learns of what his \\"crazy\\", jealous mother did to Miss Crane he acts the part of a dutiful son and cleans up Cabin 1 where Miss Crane was murdered. Our hearts are angered and saddened at the death of a lead character and easily feel sorrow for the life that Mr. Bates is forced to live due to his \\"invalid mother\\". I was amused to find that the 40 thousand dollars which was troubling Miss. Cranes co-workers, employer, custumor, family, friends and lover was thrown away with the body.   <br /> <br />Anywaya private detective comes up to Farvale or Fairvale (I can't rightly remember the name of the town)by following Marion's sister so he could visit with Sam Loomis and investigate the whereabouts of Miss. Marion Crane. After much questioning is did among the three he leaves Miss. Crane's sister Lila with Sam while he investigates the motel and \\"interviews\\" Mrs. Bates.  When he fails to return Sam and Lila go up to the motel and unravel the mystery of what happened at Bates Motel. <br /> <br />Just a little personal experience of mine due to the film.  When this movie was over it was 2 in the morning I had to go upstairs to my bedroom.  I couldn't turn on the hall lights or anything because my parents and my brother were both sound asleep.  By the way the house I live in has been in the family for over 100 years and looks kind of like the Bates house on the outside except theirs was more victorian. So here I am going up the stairs, by myself in this old, creaking house and fearfully remembering the \\"interview\\" between Mrs. Bates and the private detective. Luckily I didn't meet Mrs. Bates. ;)!  <br /> <br />This film is a landmark acheivement in horror films and will be for all time. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd was awesome! I loved all the songs, especially \\"Crazy\\". It really says what is going on around the world. If you don't have this cd pick it up and you truly won't regret it. It totally rocks and the guys are great!!!!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is back! With their new album, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" which debuted on #3 in the top records sold in the U.S. and Japan! Also not to mention #2 in Canada! These 5 young muscians have proved that their album goes way beyond what people would have expected. With catchy songs like \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Welcome To My Life\\", there are also songs that talk about everyday serious issues like in \\"Crazy\\" and \\"One\\". With all breath taking lyrics and catchy tunes, this CD is by far one of the BEST.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still not getting any is my favorite cd. I can relate to every song on the cd. I think the one I relate to the most is \\"Everytime\\". This was the best cd I every bought. I am going to buy it again.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's 2nd album, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is just as SPECTACULAR as the 1st!! With great new jams such as \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Promise\\", and the radio-debued \\"Welcome to My Life\\", Simple Plan will hit it BIG in stores! Every song has a message that teens can relate to. Most of the songs are fun to listen to, like \\"Jump\\" and \\"Thank You\\", yet there are some that you can cry to, like \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Untitled\\" (the last track). You can tell that Simple Plan has taken a lot of time to create this album by just listening to it once!! Get it! It's a great CD by artist who actually write their own music!
B00003CXA6|4.0|Caveat - I have given this movie a split star ranking of four/three stars. The target audience for Gettysburg is the Civil War enthusiast, and I believe that they will find my ranking of four stars appropriate. The general audience, with no particular interest in the American Civil War should consider this a three-star effort.<br />Gettysburg is based (fairly faithfully) on Michael Sharara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Killer Angels, and tells the story of the bloodiest single battle in American history. Like the novel, the movie does an excellent job of sympathetically presenting the perspectives of both the North and the South. It tells the stories of several officers who fought on both sides, and through highlighting their stories, shows the war not as a simple tale of good against evil, but as a tragedy of epic proportions, where cruel fate set friend against friend in bitter and deadly conflict.<br />This movie is filmed gorgeously. The filming was done on location around Gettysburg, and the landscapes are captures beautifully. It does an excellent job of showing the grand scale of armies in motion and the historical details of the uniforms, equipment, and other period touches are nearly flawless. Though the battle scenes don't attempt to accurately portray the actual carnage of war, they are fine spectacles, skillfully and dramatically done. The only flaw in the look and feel of this movie is with the ridiculously fake facial hair that several of the actors wear. It is a minor point, but was quite distracting, especially in close-up shots.<br />The acting in this movie was uneven, ranging from outstanding to woodenly bad. Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain delivered far and away the best performance of this movie, and possibly the best of his career. His Chamberlain is always believable, and does the heavy lifting in presenting the Union perspective. In the battle on Little Round Top, he was given the single best scene of the movie, and he rose to the occasion splendidly. Tom Berenger, as General Pete Longstreet had the most screen time on the Confederate side, and performed adequately, not brilliantly. His Longstreet had but two notes - dour and taciturn. He was also burdened with one of the worst fake beards in the movie, which proved constantly distracting. Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Robert E. Lee, while possibly historically accurate, (Lee was literally both sick and tired during his campaign in Pennsylvania) is unlikely to satisfy most fans of this general of \\"sainted\\" memory, and at any rate, is not one of his better performances. Steven Lang was wonderful in his role as the dim, vain, but likeable General Pickett. Sam Elliott, brought his usual imposing presence to the small role of Colonel Buford, but was given speeches to deliver rather than believable dialogue. An actor who seemed to have no sense of the historical General J.E.B. Stuart, and who sported the single worst fake beard of the movie butchered the role. The role of General Hood, who was a young man of 31, was miscast, played by an actor who appeared to be at least 50.<br />If you are a Civil War enthusiast, this is a must see movie despite its flaws. If not, you may still find it interesting if only for Jeff Daniels truly outstanding performance, but should probably rent, rather than buy it. I give it a qualified recommendation.<br /><br />Theo Logosthe occasion splendidly.

B000068IEU|1.0|Wow! I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was with this supposed \\"classic\\". The Last House on the Left is the worst movie I have ever seen. I consider myself a pretty big fan of the horror genre, but this film just has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The direction is second-rate, the acting is an abomination and the soundtrack is deranged. This film should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is (in my opinion) the best horror film ever made. Last House is not scary, disturbing or even interesting. The violence is presented so non-chalantly that the viewer is not in anyway shocked. The rape scenes (with a few quick edits) could play on network TV. What this film really reminded me of was a cross between the Brady Bunch, MacGyver(setting up the booby traps) and a jail break film. I mean, the parents just simply become savage killers with little to no evidence that these people killed their daughter? I never thought I would find the bottom of the barrel in the horror genre, but The Last House on the Left somehow manages to take that crown easily. Avoid at all costs! Not even recommended to hardcore horror fans.
0064407667|5.0|`The Bad Beginning' is the first of the series in Lemony Snicket's `A Series of Unfortunate Events'. When I first read a description of this book, I was intrigued as to an author writing unfortunate happenings in a children's book. Reading the entire book in a quick read, I found the story to be very captivating and entirely different from any other book that I have previously read. <br /> <br />It all starts on a dull day at Briny Beach where Violet, Klaus and Sunny, the three Baudelaire children receive news that they parents had passed away in their home when it burnt down and all their belongings perished. Things worsen when they are sent to live with Count Olaf, a mean old man who is a distant relative of their parents, and who has other plans for the children rather than taking care of them. <br /> <br />Lemony Snicket has a wonderful way of keeping the reader absorbed in the story. Just when you expect something good to happen for the children, the author puts them in another drastic situation. Yet in the end of this book, you feel relieved as well as sorry for the Baudelaire children as you do not know what unfortunate events they are likely to encounter in the future.  <br /> <br />There are many people who seem to enjoy this series of Lemony Snicket's work and I wouldn't disagree. I am 20 years old studying in college and I know several people studying with me who enjoy reading the series. However, I wouldn't recommend telling these stories to young toddlers, such as kids under the ages of 5-6 as they might find it a little too scary to cope up with. No child wants to know about parents burning in a house, or about a bad man like Count Olaf who makes the children do tedious chores, or about a man with hooks for hands who even made me feel a little scared! <br /> <br />All in all, I found this book as a wonderful read and cannot wait to get started on the next one. <br />
B00000DLUV|5.0|There will never again be a band like the Bee Gees. My wife Debbie's favorite band will live on forever in our hearts even though they will never play again with their original members. Thank you Bee Gees for all the wonderful energy and melodies of my childhood and early adulthood.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Politics is the only professional sport I follow; however, I really love a good documentary.  I am Canadian and I didn't have much respect for Michael Moore after hearing I had been living in a national paradise all my life - as he promoted in \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\"  My dim view of his film making ability is entirely reversed by \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\"<br /><br />Moore has made a film that really transends the documentary genre.  Everybody agrees that films like \\"Thin Blue Line\\", \\"Radio Bikini\\", and \\"Fog of War\\" are all incredible - I have seen them a number of times.  Fahrenheit 9/11 leaves them in a dustbin as far superior.<br /><br />This film provokes a lot of emotion, that is was distinguishes it from most documentaries that stir up only outrage, horror or intellectual sadness; although the movie brings in all those feelings in too.  The film doesn't have the professional polish of a production like the \\"Fog of War\\" but I think that is intentional - it is clear Moore's object is the superficial productions and the polished presentation of the government Moore dislikes so strongly.<br /><br />Granted, I am more sympathetic to Moore's political stance than perhaps a conservative American would be.  I do have the perspective of my American and typically Republican voting wife to add objectivity to my review.<br /><br />I really did laugh at some parts: John Ashcroft singing is really funny.  The movie provoked the fear of September 11th without images, leaving the experience as personal and as unique as each viewer.  I cried like a grandmother at the horrors of war and the parallels between the Iraqi woman and the Michigan mother.<br /><br />Few dramatic movies have done what \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" has done.  I can more than sympathize with the political obstacle faced by a conservative viewer would have to appreciate this movie.  I have no doubt that it is the greatest documentary I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is a must see movie.
B00063MBU8|5.0|the new album from simple plan is sensational.  its not just one style of music anymore, the band has expanded and really just started playing and writing whatever sounds good and i tell you what it has definatley worked! if you liked the first album i believe you will enjoy this album even more!
B0000C8AVI|4.0|This album bugged out a lot of people, particularly when it first came out, almost solely because of its unremitting message.  But really if you ignore the lyrics, there's a good record in here.  Not great but good.  And as the fear that Bob has totally lost his mind and will be doing nothing but singing Jesus songs for the rest of his life, this album's stature has grown.  Clearly, whether you agree or even care about what he's singing about, he really means it.  Personally I don't care if the lyrics are about sins, salvation and Satan or if they're about hoboes, immigrants and landlords.  I'm only interested in the music.  And musically, it's a lot more consistent than Street Legal.  Although there aren't any songs as good as the three good ones on that record, overall it's much better.  Clearly \\"New Pony\\" has re-inspired Bob to write more songs around a single riff.  \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\", \\"Slow Train\\", \\"Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking\\" and \\"When You Gonna Wake Up?\\" all follow this formula.  They're best songs on this album.  The slower numbers, \\"Precious Angel\\", \\"I Believe In You\\" and \\"When He Returns\\" are powerful, but not nearly as impressive.  Also included is a whole new category for Dylan, Kid's songs.  Since the first songs most of us ever learn are Bible songs, it does make since.  \\"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\\" is silly and fun (which is nice on such an otherwise heavy record).  And \\"Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)\\", with it's extra beat added every fourth measure (going from 4/4 to 5/4) is one of the most musically complicated things Bob's written since the jazz chords of \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" or the constantly shifting keys of \\"In Search Of Little Sadie\\".  Overall Slow Train Coming is a pretty good album, and despite being a fairly staunch atheist, I enjoy listening to it.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|Conceived and produced by Martin Scorsese this Seven DVD set should be taken as a modern oral history told by seven different voices - each a director in his own right and each coming to a specific form, expression or development of the blues. The story often seems too catholic in its choice of 'Blusemen' but that is subjective for my personal taste but neither Scorsese or the other directors, which include Clint Eastwood and Wim Wenders, attempt to present a complete history but different entrances into a world which traces American history - reminding us that it is a history of contrasts - The American Dream Vs The Escalation of American Imperialism and its accompanying enslavement of Afro/ Americans. But more than that this series is a primer for anyone who wants to trace the history of popular music, its subversiveness, immediacy and power. This is not a series for anyone with an attention span of three minutes nor for anyone who wants to avoid paying attention to personal reflections, telling detail or anecdotal evidence. It is a good place to start for anyone who can take time out and bring sufficient commitment to a a culture and an art form which has shaped more of our present day consciousness than many of us are aware of. Now what we be really interesting would be for a black historian and film director to make an even more personal and in-depth study of The Blues. Its hard to think who might meet that criteria - which shows that there are still many reasons to get The Blues, Save the blues and learn from The Blues.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I know it seems like I'm just disagreeing with the commonly held Dylan perceptions on just about everything.  But I'm not doing it just to be contrary.  Case in point: I, like most everybody else, actually like Blood On The Tracks.  I've never heard the original New York pressing, but for my money the Minneapolis tracks fit in and work perfectly.  In fact, I can't even tell which ones were re-recorded.  I know most people like to look at this album as an emotionally raw and painful, if cathartic, album of heartbreak (much like John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band.)  But if you don't pay to much attention to the lyrics, it's a fairly upbeat, up-tempo collection of songs.  Particularly bouncy are the two songs with some of the most maudlin words: \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" and \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\".  \\"Meet Me In The Morning\\" is yet another one of Bob's re-interpretations of the 12-bar Blues format.  In fact, even the lyrics to \\"Lily Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts\\" are light-hearted.  Really, only \\"Idiot Wind\\" and \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" are particularly slow, sad, or are in a minor key musically.  While \\"You're Big Girl Now\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album, I never quite understood what the big deal about \\"Idiot Wind\\" was.  It's a good song, but really the weakest one on this collection.  And it does just go on and on.  \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", \\"Shelter From The Storm\\", and \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\" are all bona-fide classics.  \\"Buckets Of Rain\\" not so much.  And while overall this is an unarguably great collection of songs, I don't find myself listening to it that often.  Clearly it's not because the subject matter strikes a nerve.  I don't know - maybe it's just too perfect and there are not enough weird fun little flaws to get caught up in.  Still I always do enjoy it on those rare occasions when I do play it.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Director Michael Mann takes a new turn (probably for the worse) in this new action thriller starring Tom Cruise. <br />Where previous installments (The Insider, Heat) were slow burners, guaranteed to satisfy eventually, Collateral starts with fire in the belly, at relatively fast pace, but loses momentum midway through. <br />Essential Mann characteristics are present though, from masterful filming sequences, to an excellent soundtrack, but the flick remains one step behind the director's standards. <br />Tom Cruise, cast against (very well known) type, plays Vincent, a serial killer on a mission to kill five witnesses on one long night, and needs a cabbie to \\"fulfill his needs\\". <br />He accidentally stumbles upon Max (excellently played by Jamie Foxx, in his best role to date), and takes him for a long ride full of unpleasant and frightening surprises. <br />At first, the action and weird, funny dialogues suck you in, but once the third murder is accomplished, and Vincent pays a visit to Max's mom in the hospital, we get the feeling that the movie is heading nowhere and it loses credibility. <br />The fact that the fifth victim happens to be the woman Max met earlier in the evening, and developed a sudden crush on her, fails enormously to convince. <br />The useless side story with the LA police and the FBI doesn't help much either. <br />Well cast, entertaining, funny at times, this is a movie to enjoy if not expecting to be dazzled by movie making.
B0000C8AVE|4.0|Bob rarely does the same thing twice (well - he rarely does the same thing three times in a row), and here on his second album he's already changing things around.  Gone are most of the covers (only \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" remains).  Instead we get a lot of Bob Dylan in his own words.  In fact two of the songs include his name in the title (\\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\").  And furthermore The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is a good album.  He manages to create a fairly wide diversity of styles with his limited instrumental palette of voice, guitar, and harmonica.  Although there is one song one here, \\"Corrina, Corrina\\", which features outside musicians - upright bass and brushed drums - for the first time (unless you count the deleted single \\"Mixed-Up Confusion\\") already showing Bob's frustration with that limitation.  While the album is best known for its finger-pointing protest songs (\\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"Masters Of War\\", \\"Oxford Blues\\", and \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\\"), there's a lot more to it than that.  There are a couple of great touching sad songs (the classic \\"Girl From North Country\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice\\").  And there's also a lot of fun goofy songs that are as well remembered - \\"Talkin' World War II Blues\\", \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\", and \\"I Shall Be Free\\".  There's also a couple examples of a common Bob Dylan M.O.: a standard 12-bar blues progression that he plays like he invented it, as a vehicle for some of his wild and wooly words: \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" and \\"Down The Highway\\".

B0000C8AVR|4.0|Highway 61 Revisited is not nearly as good as Bringing It All Back Home but still an amazing album.  More fun up-tempo blues numbers: \\"Tombstone Blues\\", the title track, \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\\", and \\"From A Buick 6\\" (two more great titles!).  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" deserves its reputation as an all-time rock'n'roll classic.  Bob is stretching with \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\" and it works.  Creepy and funny, it's my favorite song on the album.  Side two is a problem though.  Other than the title track, it's filled with somewhat tedious, mid-tempo, too long excuses for clever lyrics: \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" and \\"Desolation Row\\".  \\"Desolation Row\\" even features the return of that incessantly jamming slightly off-key guitar from \\"It's All Over Now\\".  Sure, nothing could be as good as it, but highway 61 Revisited is still a worthy follow-up to Bringing It All Back Home.
B000008LOV|5.0|What's left to say? This album is as good as music gets.<br /><br />But when are we going to see the CD?
B0000024RZ|5.0|While most Dylan fans seem to prefer The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan to its consistently dour follow-up, I actually like The Times They Are A-Changin' better.  Sure, The Freewheelin'­ Bob Dylan does feature a lot more diversity of styles, the almost constant barrage of \\"protest\\" songs makes Bob's activism seem like less of a pose.  Besides, putting the lyrics aside (as I tend to do), the subject matter must've spurred Bob into writing a much stronger set of pieces from a musical standpoint.  \\"Ballad Of Hollis Brown\\" and \\"Boots Of Spanish Leather\\" are better than anything on its predecessor.  Besides, not all of the songs are about causes.  \\"One Too Many Mornings\\", \\"Boots Of Spanish Leather\\", and \\"Restless Farewell\\" could all probably count as love songs.  Although I will agree that there isn't much on here that's upbeat (either lyrically or musically), I think that it's a much more heart-rending and powerful album for it.  Besides there is some optimism in the title track and \\"When The Ship Comes On\\" and some humor in \\"With God On Our Side\\".  It's not completely bleak.  Really, my biggest complaint comes from \\"With God On My Side\\".  First of all - it tends to drag on a little long for a song with only one guitar and no new parts.  It also features something that crops up a lot on these early Dylan albums.  He seems completely unsure what kind of accompaniment he wants on the guitar.  Sometimes he's got this wild strumming on the triplets, but when he gets tired and can't keep up he switches to just hitting the downbeats.  It's very distracting whenever it happens.  Luckily, we don't hear much more of it after \\"with God On Our Side\\".
B00000K3CM|4.0|All kidding aside, this 1992 follow-up to the mega 1990 smash hit, is a delightful and fun little romp through the most magical of cities at Christmas time, New York City. While the nostalgia and set-up in the first film doesn't quite carry over into this one fully intact, it's a credible sequel to the first film. With the world getting into the holiday mood and sprit, I have been in the mood for reviewing some Christmas stuff. This time, young Kevin McAlister(Macaulay Culkin)and his family, and extended family, are planning a yuletide trip to Florida. In the usual mad cap dash to the destination, as in the first film, little Kevin is lost behind in the shuffle, and instead of joining his family on the plane to Florida, he boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City. If this isn't too much of an stretched out plot ploy, then the fact that little Kevin, in the gigantic abyss that is New York, runs into the two bumblibg crooks from the first film, again played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. What a coinkidink. The two survived their torture in the boobytrapped house, and have now escaped prison, and are looking for revenge. Quite convenient that Kevin is right there. Even though the film seems to be mostly a re-tread of the original, it makes glorious use of it's beautiful surroundings and new location, and manages to make it somewhat fresh, even if the material mostly isn't. The movie squeezes out some genuine laughs, but not high on the meter as the original. The cartoon violence is upped to another level, and some of it, like in the first, is quite clever and inventive. Almost too clever for a small boy. The cast, returning and new, all shine here, and really carry the film along. Culkin is sweet and charming, and he hasn't lost what he had in the original here. But in recent times, what happened?. Pesci and Stern are definitley game, and they are a hoot and a half to watch. Seeing little Pesci get beat down is always fun, and Stern's reaction to the pain and torture is still as funny as the original. John Heard and Catherine 'O' Hara get minimal time, again, but it is the great 'O' Hara that is the only one of the two who ends up getting something. New additions including the wonderful Tim Curry, a concierge at the famed hotel Kevin stays at. Funnyman Rob Schneider is the bell boy. Brenda Fricker is a friendly bird lady Kevin meets in Central Park, and vetern actor Eddie Bracken is the owner of a toy store. But seriously, wouldn't anyone be a little upset and worried that Kevin's mother has left him behind twice, and that he has always, in both times, ended up in mortal danger?. Jeez louise!. The first time, while still horrible to happen to anybody, can be seen as happening. But a second time?!. Didn't the first time teach not just her, but the rest of the family, to be more aware?. I guess not. Director Chris Columbus, returning from the first film, shoots the film elegantly, and makes the most out of the city. He really sets the tone for the holidays and the right Christmas spirit. HA 2 may have fallen a little short from part 1's standing, but it is a worthy follow up.
B0000C8AV3|3.0|While no work of art should be judged on the basis of what it isn't, no album is more defined by what isn't on it as much as Infidels.  At first this was a good thing, because what isn't on it are any songs with an overtly Christian message.  Except for \\"Man Of Peace\\" which everybody chose to ignore (maybe the blatantly pro-Israel \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" canceled it out).  But as reports surfaced of even greater songs being recorded and not released on this record, its reputation sank.  While there are rumors of superior versions of almost every album Bob recorded languishing in the vaults, from the most beloved (the original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, the New York version of Blood On The Tracks) to the most despised (the Argentinean misprint of Down In The Groove with \\"Important Words\\" on it) none have suffered so much in comparison to what it could have been as Infidels.  And it's not hard to see why.  Not only is \\"Foot Of Pride\\" easily the equal of anything on that album, but \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" is as superior to the rest of Infidels as \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\" is to the remainder of ­Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid.  Although, I suppose it could always be worse, the few good songs on Infidels could've been replaced with \\"Julius And Ethel\\" or \\"Death Is Not The End\\" or \\"Lord, Save My Child\\".  In fact \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" and \\"Foot Of Pride\\" manage to be some of the best things on The Bootleg Series 1-3 on which they finally do appear.  \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" is now played live far more often than anything that did end up on the album (which didn't even get the same sort of historical revisionism that added \\"The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\\" do Shot Of Love).  But, what of the actual album that was released?  \\"Sweetheart Like You\\", \\"Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight\\", \\"Neighborhood Bully\\", and \\"Man Of Peace\\" are all about as unremarkable and pedestrian as anything on Planet Waves.  \\"License To Kill\\" actually is a good song, but I had no idea until I heard Tom Petty singing it at the 30th Anniversary Celebration.  This version does it no justice.  Regardless if you agree with the politics behind the rather trite and simplistic lyrics of \\"Union Sundown\\" it is actually fairly good rocking tune from a musical point of view. The only track on here that can go toe-to-toe with \\"Foot Of Pride\\" (if not \\"Blind Willie McTell\\") is \\"I And I\\".  I have no idea what it's about, but I like it.  I don't know why \\"Jokerman\\" was picked to be the single, and is still used in all the subsequent compilations (Greatest Hits Vol. III, The Essential Bob Dylan).  The whoa-oh-oh-ohs that Bob sings before the title are not only completely off, which isn't a horrible or surprising sin for Bob, but it doesn't even sound like he's missing the same notes each time.

B00063MBU8|5.0|At first sound, you may not like this album because it doesn't fit with the \\"typical\\" Simple Plan style... but keep listening!  The more I listen to the album the more I hear the genius in it.  The lyrics are incredibly powerful and insightful, and the music is so creative.  I enjoy the fact that this album isn't like all those other albums that can be placed into a specific category. This is unique in that it has several different styles, and none of them feel like a record company manufacturing product to increase album sales... they are all real and innovative!!!  I love this album and I hope that everyone will listen to it and give it a serious chance!!!  Not to mention the Dual Disc... it's awesome!  The footage shot during the making of the album was hilarious as well as informative.  Nothing but good times!!
B0000C8AW2|4.0|While most of Bob's big band sound is in tact from Desire, trading the violin for the saxophone and Emmy Lou's lone back-up vocals for a trio of female gospel singers suddenly turns the ragged gypsy caravan into a slick Vegas production.  I've always been really conflicted about Street Legal.  On one hand you've got this brave new experimental band giving the songs a wide variety of possible sounds.  On the other, the LP was recorded almost as muddily and murkily as The Basement Tapes leaving most of the subtle nuances buried in the mix (subsequent attempts to re-mix the album have produced no effect audible to my ears).  On the plus side you've got three of my all-time favorite Dylan tunes: \\"Senor (Tales Of Yankee Power)\\", \\"New Pony\\", and \\"Changing Of The Guards\\".  \\"New Pony\\" even shows a return of Bob writing an entire song around one simple magnetic riff, something we haven't heard since \\"The Wicked Messenger\\" on John Wesley Harding.  However, the other two-thirds of the songs on there are as unremarkable and forgettable as Planet Waves.  The band on this album is great.  I don't know why it gets knocked as too show-biz-y.  I even liked their live At Budokan album.  I generally don't pay much attention to live albums (If the songs are too close to the original arrangements, then why not just listen to the original.  If the songs are too far off of the arrangements, then they just seem sacrilegious).  But the constant way that Bob and his quote-unquote Vegas band deconstruct and rearrange the most notable songs from Bob's catalog is both fascinated and brave, if not always successful (\\"Going, Going, Gone\\").  I find myself listening to Street Legal a lot - if just out of curiosity, though not usually enjoying it as much as I think I should.
0812550706|4.0|They told me over and over to read this book.  I kept finding reasons to put it off.  What a mistake.  This is a fantastic novel.  The quality of the story and the writing is well above that of the average published author.  However, the characters seem...well, like characters.  Not quite so real.  Nonetheless, this is a very enjoyable read, and it is almost guaranteed to hook you into the series.
B0000C8AW5|3.0|I've got to admit, I really don't like Planet Waves.  For one thing I'm not a big fan of The Band.  I've not particularly liked any of the stuff they've done as a group.  Robbie Robertson always seemed like a smug, condescending, pretentious rock-star (like Sting or Phil Collins).  Back when they were just a band and not The Band, they were good for what Dylan was doing on tour in 1966 (namely loud), but there's a reason why he always ended up using the Nashville session players on his album.  (The fact that drummer Levon helm was too chicken to endure the boos of Tour '66 is another stroke against them).  Their playing has always been as subtle as a sledgehammer.  But it's not entirely The Band's fault that I don't like this album.  On Planet Waves, Bob finally achieves what he was aiming for on Nashville Skyline and New Morning; he becomes a completely detached, uninvolved songwriter.  But where those two discs were charming in the sincere ineptitude, this one actually pulls it off slickly - much to its detriment.  And as a result songs like \\"Tough Mama\\", \\"Hazel\\", \\"Something There Is About You\\", \\"You Angel You\\", and \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" are almost impossible to tell apart.  It'll become a bad habit that'll pop up again and again in Bob's career.  The opening number holds some promise.  The Cajun Zydeco of \\"On A Night Like This\\" promises more of the weird genre experimentation of New Morning's \\"Winterlude\\" and \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", but never follows up on it.  \\"Going Going Gone\\" is in fact a really good song, but you can hardly tell over The Band's showboating.  (Although I like most of At Budokan, the version of \\"Going, Going Gone\\" on there proves it could be much much worse).  \\"Forever Young\\" ends Bob's tradition of adding more than one version of the same song to the same album (\\"Alberta\\" and \\"Billy\\").  While the slower second version is pretty darn good (and proof that Rod Stewart is a thief), the fast version makes the song seem almost as forgettable as the rest of the album.  Compare \\"Dirge\\" with the similarly arranged (just piano and acoustic guitar) \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" from The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3, and see how distracting Robbie Robertson is in comparison to Mark Knopfler.  His little scratching the string thing is all over here and really annoying.  Even without The Band, \\"The Wedding Song\\" sounds about as tacked on as it really was.  Not that the album is painfully unlistenable or anything.  With a musician as talented as Bob Dylan, even when he's coasting there's bound to be a certain amount of quality to endeavor.  It's just that there's a real lack of anything interesting or risky going on here.of the album.

B00063MBU8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Simple Plan all throughout their first album, \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls.\\" No Pads Was full of great 'Pop Punk' songs. \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" has matured from No Pads alot. I like every song on this CD, especially Crazy and Untitled. The only things i could live without are the back vocals in Everytime and Jump. They are used creatively, but in my opinion they almost sound over-produced. All in all, the CD sounded great, i love all the songs, and i highly reccomend it.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|It's kind of disappointing that Bob hedged his bets and didn't make this album all-electric.  Although the fact that he chose to put the acoustic songs on side 2 rather than first side or mixing them together sort of undercuts whatever kind of compromise he was trying to make with the die-hard folkies he was leaving.  Who knows?  This is one of my all-time favorite Dylan albums.  Bob's idea of rock'n'roll is certainly just loud, slightly sped up 12-bar blues with some strange words on top.  There's \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\", \\"On The Road Again\\".  \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" takes the 12-bars and stretches it into 24 or so to fit in all of his fun (if not terribly meaningful) words.  Clearly the rest of band - who play enthusiastically and with great talent, don't have any idea when the next chord is coming.  Listening to all of the attempt to keep up (or at least catch up) with Bob makes this some great rough-hewed risky rock that demands as many repeated listenings as something as exquisite and intricately constructed as say ­Pet Sounds.  And not that side 2 is just a bone thrown to his old audience.  \\"Gates Of Eden\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" are two of Bob's best songs ever.  And both featuring single solitary one-note blasts from the harmonica at the end of each verse to remind of you of what Bob used to do - and to let you know how much different this is.  Not that Bringing It All Back Home is perfect.  (No Dylan album is perfect.  Each has a couple of stinkers and at least one or two moments of genius.  The only question is how much of each - and how good are the rest.)  Neither \\"She Belongs To Me\\" nor \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" (which is a great title) do much for me.  Maybe I've just heard it too many times from the Byrds - and William Shatner - to really appreciate it, but I always thought that \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\".  And is it just me, or is the second guitar that is noodling around in the background of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" completely unrelated to what's going on in the rest of the song and slightly out of tune?  Whatever it is, it ruined \\"It's All Over Now\\" for me forever.

The latest in Moore's series of \\"mockumentaries\\", it pokes fun at everything from politics to the War on Terror.  While it has some hilarious moments (the highlight is Moore, obviously in a fat suit, pursuing passersby), it tends to drag and some of the humor will be lost on those of us who aren't politicians. <br />However, it has been reported that Congress loves it, and it is at times a howlingly hilarious spoof of political films.

B00006RCNW|5.0|I am one of those people that kept seeing commercials for this show and thinking \\"Hmm, that looks ok, maybe I should watch it.\\" but never getting around to it. Well, one day they had a marathon of The Shield going on, and I finally had nothing to do, so I sat down and started watching it. I got through the second episode on the marathon and I knew I was hooked. I rushed right out and bought the first season on DVD so I could see the entire set in the correct order and without missing anything. The show is great. I would put this show right up there with The Sopranos, but unlike Tony and gang, the cops in The Shield are trying to do good things....as long as it doesn't interfere with profits. The moral ambiguity in the show really helps make it believable and work for many people. You might find that you like a cop like Mackey being able to get the answers and information that no regular cop can, but you might find that you dislike him for using the methods he does to get them. The show presents the question \\"Is a win for the good guys a win no matter what the cost?\\" and then leaves you to answer it for yourself.

038551123X|3.0|The idea of DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER was so clever that I decided to get the book: serial killer story turned on its head. The protagonist is a serial killer who is the good guy. Dexter, a forensic blood spatter expert, only kills those who need killing such as other serial killers. Sort of like a Zorro or Robin Hood of psychopaths. However clever the premise, I couldn't slog through the execution of it. I found the writing uninspired and a little juvenile even comic book-like. Perhaps the latter impression is because I sense that this is supposed to be a witty novel or a novel with comedic elements -- but I never got the Joke. And maybe that is the fatal blow for me: the writing never takes itself seriously even though the subjects are monsters with no feelings. I will acknowledge that sustaining a witty book about such dark creatures without it becoming a parody of itself is a big order and here the writing teeters and falls to the side of not being serious enough and so for me the book doesn't work. We could mention that the characters in DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER tend to be cardboardish and the dialogue wooden but the body is already cold on this first attempt of Jeff Lindsay. The crime scene reveals to this maybe too serious detective rather light fare; buy it for the novelty but don't expect much.
B000002KXV|4.0|\\"Nightfly\\" was Donald Fagen's first solo album after the break-up of Steely Dan in 1981. The music is a natural continuation the peerless perfection of Steely Dan, and Fagen's vocals are as great as ever.<br /><br />To some listeners his style may sound a little more jazzy/funky than most Steely Dan albums. So if you prefer the \\"rockier\\" side of Steely Dan, this album may disappoint a little; at least in the beginning.<br /><br />But as with most Steely Dan songs, these will grow on you, the better you get to know them; so the album ends up sounding a lot like another Steely Dan album.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album is not as good as \\"Battle of Los Angles\\" but it is my second favorite album by \\"Rage Against the Machine\\". Even thought many said it was repetitive i foung this to be quite untrue. Some songs lack POWER unlike the others, like Settle For Nothing and Township Rebellion. This band has got great lyrics, and if you listen to WAKE UP and KNOW YOUR ENEMY you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />Bombtrack  5/5 <br />-A great opener with kick @ss bass. <br /> <br />Killing in the Name  5/5 <br />-Dont know why they dont list the lyrics but oh well its good. <br /> <br />Take The Power Back 5/5 <br />-Love the bass. What they say about the school system is true. <br /> <br />Settle for Nothing 1/5 <br />-This is the MAJOR downer of the album. I wish this album came with a noose so i could hang myself when i reached this song. <br /> <br />Bullet in the Head 3/5 <br />-Good! But not a Gramy Winner. At least its better than the poo before it. <br /> <br />Know Your Enemy 5/5 <br />-This is the Gramy Winner right here folks! The best on the album!  <br /> <br />Wake Up 5/5 <br />-The second best song! Zack De La Rocha must have died from not breathing after this song. Crazy Vocals, Wierd as hell guitar. <br /> <br />Fist Full of Steel 3/5 <br />Eh, it's ok. <br /> <br />Township Rebellion 3/5 <br />So-so. <br /> <br />Freedom 5/5 <br />This is the perfect last song for this album. It leaves you breathless, shocked and wanting to know where your FREEDOM is!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This was my first Michael Moore film.  I was amazed at how well the film was put together.  My husband and I went to see this and we both thought that Michael Moore did a great job of making this film.  It is a hard film to watch, but one that I think every American should see.

B00003CXCT|1.0|\\"Yes, these changes mean that the Star Wars films are no longer the ones you saw 20 years ago, but these brief changes hardly affect the films, and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies. It's not like a digitized Ewan McGregor has replaced Alec Guiness's scenes\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> No, but he might as well have done. <br /> <br /> I mean that too. <br /> <br /> To alter what i consider to be the greatest film ever made (the trilogy) just so it \\"meshes\\" with the appaling excuses for films that the new star wars films are, is something so wrong it beggars belief. <br /> <br /> Boba fett now has a South African accent (no disrespect to SA), haan solo blatantly speaks the same lines twice in the space of a few minutes just so we can see an obviously cgi jabba make a disgrace out of himself, and worst of the worst of the worst - they changed the ending. Unforgivable. <br /> <br /> New boy haydn christensen (what were they thinking getting this softie in to play one of the most infamous movie villains of all time????) has replaced anakin's ghost, the music has been changed and new scenes have been added showing absolutely rubbish (for want of a ruder word) cgi cities celebrating (how would they know so quickly anyway?). It's an abomination that almost made me throw the boxed set in the bin - no joke. You don't change the ending of a film, not like this, it's appalling. <br /> <br /> Stay well away, I hate saying that cos these are my favourite films, but they've been ruined by a past-it george lucas' \\"vision\\" of what star wars should look like. They shouldn't have let him near his own material to ruin it, they really shouldn't. The george lucas of yesteryear would be turning in his proverbial grave. <br /> <br /> Please feel free to edit this paragraph out if it's unacceptable, but the one word that sums this boxed set up perfectly is this: bastardisation. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|I saw this movie right when it was released, and bought the DVD last week. I have to say that this is a superb movie filled with tons of special effects. It shows two things: 1. that our resources are on the verge of extinction and if we do not continue to watch ourselves, the similar scenario will happen. There will be a second world flood, (although not Biblical and we would not travel in the ark, like Noah did).  Millions of people will die, and the whole world would be devastated.  <br />2. This film also shows the struggle of the main heroes. From that time when Sam decided to stay in the library (that was the only way to survive) to when he saved his girlfriend from dying of pneumonia to waiting patiently for his dad to arrive and rescue them all, this film makes us think about peoples' courage. In short, this film is a must for special effects buffs to our government.
B000021Y77|5.0|Lola receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend Manni who lost a small fortune.  Now it's up to Lola to retrieve the money somehow. <br />  <br />A fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat adventure; \\"Run Lola Run\\" is like Viagra for the eyeballs.  There are two alternative endings built right into the movie to show different outlooks, and if there were no extra endings the movie would be like 30 minutes long. <br />
0440236738|1.0|This novel is pretty much a regurgitated version of \\"Tell No One\\", and all of Coben's subsequent novels have been the same way. I think that Coben, whose Myron Bolitar novels didn't do nearly as well as his new books have been doing, has finally discovered the niche that will get his books sold the fastest, and so he has been rehashing the same plot and characters, putting them into slightly different situations, and cranking out more generic Coben thrillers. If you disagree with me and think that each new Coben book is more original than the last, let me give you a breakdown of the formula he uses and tell me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br />Our hero -- a wimpy, yet intelligent and good-hearted guy -- has lost someone close to him and has never quite gotten over it. Suddenly, he receives a message which leads him to believe that the person he thought he lost is in fact still alive. Coincidently enough, he becomes the target of evil, James Bond-esque bad guys (complete with the typical invincible assassin who is all-knowing and all-powerful) who have some unfinished business involving the hero's lost loved one and believe he can lead them to him/her. The hero enlists the aid of his hard-hitting, invincible partner that acts as the hero's deus ex machina throughout the story (a deus ex machina being a literary plot device that enables the hero to escape from seemingly impossible situations whenever the author can't think of a more original way to get him out of said situations). With the bone-headed FBI agents who believe the hero to be guilty of wrongdoing hot on his trail, the hero eventually manages to save the day and get the bad guys, and in the end is reunited with his loved one. Then, after all is said and done, Coben throws in some bizarre, obtuse and unnecessarily complicated twist that makes the readers go \\"Ooooh, why didn't I think of that?\\" <br /> <br />Well, the reason you didn't think of it is because only the author, who knows all the angles of the story he's writing, could have thought of it because he's the one writing it. It just doesn't seem right to have a Harlan Coben novel that doesn't end with a stupid twist. Back when he was writing Myron books, Coben was actually good at the craft of using twist endings, but he eventually lost it after he decided to start writing commercialized, housewife-appealing thrillers with no substance and the same recycled plot over and over again. <br /> <br />If you are a true Harlan Coben fan, stick to his Myron Bolitar books, which didn't try to be cliche so that they would appeal to the mass market of people who don't mind if the books they read are all alike. I find it somewhat ironic, because Coben frequently makes evident the fact that he despises all things cliche, as he always pokes fun at them in his writing. Well, for all his claims, Coben has become the definition of cliche by selling out and cranking out generic Hollywood thrillers again and again and again.
B000007SPU|5.0|The second in the series of \\"This Mortal Coil\\"is much longer and Dominic Appleton of \\"Breathless\\"another unique band worth checking out, has offered up his vocal skills along with Alison Limeric, a vibrant wonderful singer,as well as the sisters Diedre and Loise Rutowski who`s  harmonies rival the wilson sisters of the band \\"Heart\\".The first song \\"The Jewler\\" sung by Appleton is a sweet melancholy story and there are also some other storyteller type songs.\\"My father\\" a Judy Collins song, Covered by Alison Limeric is extremly well done and as beautiful as songs get. Limerics voice sores to great hights and plumets to low visa versa,versa visa.I often have to repeat it because one listen is`nt enough.\\"The strength of Strings\\" is a rather unique song but is a treat to hear and I must say at first I didn`t know it was Appleton on the vocal because I had never heard him sing in the range he`s using, meanwhile instrumental soundscapes run through it connecting it all together,same as the first but more experimental, dramitic and complicated venturing toward the tribal beat.If you liked the first then you will like this. If you are not familiar with any of them, but enjoy ecletic music then this is for you too.It`s one of those cd`s that you can put on whilst enjoying  a quite evening to your selfe.Enjoy
B000001Y2U|5.0|In 1996, the only song heard from Marilyn Manson by most people was the remake of the Eurythmics's 1983 classic \\"Sweet Dreams\\".  Immediately after that release, many who watched the music video thought of the lead singer of the same name as highly unusual.  The unique wardrobe, make-up, and physical presence had never been seen before.  However, the album \\"Smells Like Children\\", which features the song, went platinum in the US. <br /> <br />That year, they released their follow-up album \\"Antichrist Superstar\\".  This follows suit of fellow shock artists Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, and Iggy Pop.  The media and their spotlight presence broke lose.  A media frenzy began by spreading vicious rumors about Marilyn Manson, stating that he's a satanist, a self-mutilator, a psycho, and many other hurtful labels.  None of which are true.  The band became the most controversial act of that time.  Many loved them; yet, many hated them.  Either way, everybody knew the name.  Groups of protestors appeared in every show throughout their tour.  This level of controversy wouldn't settle until 2000 when Eminem released his album \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". <br /> <br />Much of this controversy roots to the material in \\"Antichrist Superstar\\".  Behind this is wonderful, deep, and expressive poetry that captivates listeners in listening closely to his every word.  Every song expresses intense anger about what occurs in everyday society.  This album is more than just a set of songs and their most successful hit \\"Beautiful People\\".  It tells a story in three phases:  \\"The Heirophant\\", \\"Inauguration of the Worm\\", and \\"Disintegrator of the Worm\\".  This means the telling of how one morphs from a worm (\\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\") to an antichrist superstar (\\"Man That You Fear\\"), hence the album title.  This amazing story places Marilyn Manson in a catagory of their own.  No other rock act could have told it better. <br /> <br />These words and the music are performed intensely, blending perfectly with the theme and exploring new music grounds.  Marilyn Manson's keeps the angry expressions intact through every song.  The variety of vocal tones used offer a more various musical surrounding besides of what listeners often expect from a hardcore rock act: always screaming.  Granted, he screams sometimes.  With the help of producer and Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor, the band creates a rock sound their own.  Through thrash guitars, synthesizers, occassional pan flutes, and others, they remain unique in the entire album.  This background captivates listeners deeper into its frightening theme.  Through the loud fast songs to the intense ballads, the album never loses its emotion. <br /> <br />Such tremendous quality makes \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" essential for hardcore rock fans.  This is sure to continue pleasing listeners for a long time.  Fans of this album should also watch the DVD \\"Dead of the World\\", which chronicles the tour that promoted \\"Antichrist Superstar\\".  Such combination makes a fine source of entertainment.

B0002858YS|5.0|This one of the most exciting albums I've heard! It's so refreshing to here the songs on this album. These guys have a way with writing '80s inspired stuff. They beat Rooney, and compete with Interpol! Great stuff from the Killers! Great Debut!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I have been a fan of Will Ferrel since he was in A Night at the Roxbury and he has never been better than in this movie.  His comic timing is subtle and he portrays a potentially idiotic character as an endearing outsider in a world that doesn't understand him.  This movie is not only good for families but it is incredibly funny.  Jon Favreau uses a lot of the sarcastic humor that he is famous for and I cannot make myself stop quoting the movie all the time! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a family, or a love for the holidays, or just wants to laugh.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is a great CD. I totally recommend it to any sp fan. Their new cd is edgier but still very simple plan. My fave song is \\"me against the world\\" very good song and \\"untitled\\" is awesome! go buy this cd!

Pure Gold!!!! <br /> <br />Shazza
0385336942|3.0|I read this book because it was recommended on NPR. The story itself is compelling and unpredictable. The beginning and the end move along quite well, but near the middle of the book the tale begins to ramble. <br /> <br />The things I disliked about the book were the corny dialogue and the stereotypical, mysterious \\"Asian Female\\".  Overall I'd recommend the book but the author should probably get a new editor.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Comparing her to other singers is sort of stupid... the basic point everyone is trying to make is this... If you love great female vocals, singing great songs... in the clasic jazzy, night club style.. this lady and this album will stand up to anything you have ever heard, by anyone.  Just get it.
B000005RR0|2.0|A long-time, diehard Stoner, I bought this because (probably like a lot of others) I never fully replaced all my great old Stones albums with their CD successors, and missed a few of the old songs, especially cornball novelties like \\"Fool to Cry\\" and \\"Hot Stuff,\\" from the great \\"Black and Blue\\" album. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed to find many of the songs edited and cut down. Why? I could understand in the vinyl days when you had x-amount of capacity on one side of a disc, but in the digital age there's no excuse for hacking off parts of these great songs. A less monumental annoyance: I can't explain why but the thing won't play in the iMac I have at work. I've played hundreds of discs on it with no problem but it keeps spitting out \\"Jump Back\\" and refusing to play. (Maybe the iMac doesn't like edited versions either.) I haven't had this problem with \\"Jump Back\\" on my PC at home, the car CD player, or my regular stereo, just on the iMac.
0679745203|2.0|I got this book for 25 cents in my library's basement and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay the retail price for it.<br /><br />There isn't much I can say other than that the language gets in the way of the \\"story\\". Heck, I couldn't even find the story at times. I hate pretentious books and all the hype surround thing one just makes it worse. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the wording could be quite beautiful. Just not my kind of book.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Normally I have to listen to a CD a couple of times before I really get into it. (Except for the songs I already know) But with this CD, I didn't have to do that. I was already hooked within the first time of hearing it! These guys have come a long way and they deserve every bit of it! I would really recommend this CD because anyone can relate to the songs. My favorite song on the CD would have to be \\"Perfect World\\".
B0002EXH5O|4.0|did dave mustaine loose the original master recordings or something? some songs in the remaster clearly have the original vocals, others have been re-recorded. i see nothing in the CD booklet about this. i can't locate anything from dave on the web. why change what isn't broke?     don't get me wrong: i listened to both back to back, and i count three total songs with re-recorded vocals by Dave: Take No Prisoners, Five Magics and Lucretia. i prefer dave's RIP vocals of 14 years ago than the updated vocals of today. i'd love to see this one reissued in its original glory. although the remastered cd is completley listenable.     those of you who have not heard this new edition of this metal masterpiece, get this one now. those of you who have been long time fans of the band and RIP, expect differences. i like both, but prefer the original vocals over the new.
0316666343|5.0|<br />\\"Lovely Bones\\" is very poignant story, fitting somewhere between Alice Sebold's \\"Lucky\\" and Katlyn Stewart's \\"Nightmares Echo.\\" Though it is fiction, the book creates a vivid alternative reality. The characters stay true to reality and blends well with Alice Sebold's nonfiction style. Superb writing. <br />

B00068IOWM|5.0|This album is a killer, no filler!  It is U2's new millenium masterpiece.  It sounds as if U2 have been listening to all of their back catalogue and have decided to throw a little of everything in the stew.  Yet this album does not come out sounding disjointed, or flawed.  It as if the previous U2 albums have just been practice for this album.   <br /> <br />Vertigo could be on any of the first 3 albums, while City of Blinding Lights sounds like they pulled it out of the Unforgettable Fire sessions.  Crumbs From Your Table could've been on the Joshua Tree, while Original Of The Species sounds so much like the Beatles if it wasn't for Bono's vocals you'd actually believe it was. <br /> <br />Buy this album as soon as it hits the stores.  I am!!
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I loved the first Matrix and greatly enjoyed Reloaded, for its action, but the third installment is pretty bad.<br /><br />Neo and Trinitys love for each was so over drawn and boring. From the get go they had no chemistry and it was like watching two walls get into it. Boring...<br /><br />The annoying little Indian girl. What the hell was that about?<br /><br />And the whole train man, homeless man, scene was retarded. 45 minutes and all it leads to is Trinity putting a gun to his head. Ho hum...<br /><br />And i laugh that the machines made a pact with the humans so that Neo can defeat Smith. That whole 'parley' scene in the machine city was nonsensical.<br /><br />Also, this movie was severely lacking great martial arts scenes, which really made the first two movies enjoyable. The final fight scene was cool but it couldnt save the rest of the terrible excuse of a sequel.
B00005JMUA|3.0|While watching this movie, I had many moments of dispair and joy at the same time. If you have seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, don't expect the same kind of movie. While Vol. 1 was a nod to martial arts flicks, this is more of a Quentin movie. When I say that, I mean there is much more dialogue and character building. But after seeing both of these movies, I don't think either one does what it's set out to do as well as it could have.    I must say, I am a HUGE Quentin Tarantino fan. I love all of his movies and he is one of my idols in the movie industry. But with the fact that everyone kisses(...)like it's gold, you run the risk of the man getting cocky. The Kill Bill' saga shows me that. There should have never been two seperate movies here. It should have just been one 3-hour flick that would have been excellent. Instead we are left with one movie that had tons of action, but no character development. The other movie has tons of character development (and dialogue) and not enough action. That is not to say that I don't like these movies, but I just think cutting into two volumes was a bit pretentious on Quentin's part.    Vol. 2 is still an enjoyable movie and it's more in-line with Quentin's previous work. The writing is sharp and it's got some really great scenes. Uma Thurman deserves SOOO much credit for playing the role of \\"The Bride\\". If this would have been condensed into one movie, she could have an oscar on her mantle for this. The revenge story that started in Vol. 1 continues here, as Uma hunts down the last three assassins responsible for the massacre.    Like I said earlier, Uma is amazing here again. Her fight scene with Daryl Hannah is great. She shows all the range here as she does emotional & revenge in the same scene. I was very impressed by her. David Carradine surprised me here, as well. Quentin has a knack of rejuvenating actors' careers and apparently it was Carradine's turn. He plays the villain in a very swarmy, calm, and cool way. Daryl Hannah looks unbelievable & kicks absolute ass here. The battle between her and Uma was the highlight of the action in the film. When she is talking to a dying Budd (Michael Madsen), and reading him a description of the Black Mamba snake is genius. It's my favorite scene in the movie.  Michael Madsen will shock you here. He plays a chubby loser for most of the movie, but gets the upper hand on Uma. The acting throughout the movie is excellent. Quentin seems to bring the best out of his actors on a consistant basis and it continues here.    I know I have complained for half the review, but this still is a good movie. I was just disappointed because I can tell what movie Quentin COULD'VE (and should've in my opinion) made and it frustrates me. There is also no pay-off with the ending. I won't give it away, but I was less than thrilled. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit up to the very end, but it's just missing something. I know a lot of you are going to disagree with me, but go watch Quentin's other movies (even True Romance, which he wrote) and tell me where this ranks. You may agree with me.    Special Features: Well, we all know there will be some special edition of these two movies someday, so I wasn't expecting a lot of supplements here. There is the same type of featurette that was on Vol. 1's DVD. It's pretty good and not your typical crappy, studio-style documentary. There is one deleted scene, which I thought should've been in the movie. I mean Quentin can't cut out A TON of stuff that didn't have to be there, but then he cuts a scene where Carradine gets to kick some ass? Makes no sense. There is also a CHINGON music performance. CHINGON is headed by Robert Rodriguez (Quentin's best friend). While I like Rodriguez's movies, I didn't need live concert footage on my DVD of him.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Yes...it is a \\"chick\\" flick...but hey this one is really good!! This story had depth, and it had substance...what a great story that this film had to tell. Just goes to show that if you stick with something long enough...you might just learn something...and that something, you could carry with u the rest of your life...never give up on your dreams!!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|You know, it is truly irritating to read the reviews from negative people who cannot back up their close-minded opinions with solid reasoning. I respect others opinions because we live in America where opinions can be said, but opinions are useless without reason.  Anyway, onto my review. A friend of mine suggested we watch this when invited over for a movie night. I said something in the context of... \\"sure, whatever\\", thinking this movie was going to be really stupid, because of the title (which I now think is good).  I had no idea what I was getting into - one of the BEST movies I have EVER seen.  If that's so you're probably wondering why I gave this only 4 stars. First reason is because I am very very stingy on writing movie reviews because like I said I am more of a music guy. Second reason is because as perfect in many aspects as this movie is, it still has its flaws, like ANYTHING ELSE.  Let's start off with the good. Plotline - yes, negative reviewers, usually the reason why you think this is a terrible film IS because you don't get it. Just because you can't comprehend something right off the bat and it is not handed to you on a silver platter doesn't mean its bad. It also doesn't mean it is bad when they leave a plot to open self-interpretation. It just means that you *GASP* may actually have to think for yourself for once.  I'm not sure I want to sum up the plotline - because I can't do that without putting my own opinion into the picture. What this movie does is subtly link every event that happens and every little detail that takes place and leaves you to interpret the meaning of it all. If you want opinion, here's what I got from it - SPOILERS - Set in 1988. Donnie Darko comes down with a severe schizophrenic disorder in which the character Frank the Rabbit represents the type of repressed human fear that dwells in us all - it just so happens that it surfaces and shows in Donnie. Excellent use of characterization. Then what happens is that Donnie starts to question the universe in which all human existence takes place... and starts to form a satirical opinion of the mechanized existence which he sees. He is then informed by Frank, who saved his life by preventing a jetliner engine that crashed through his roof from crushing him, that an apocalyptic event is coming soon because of a rip in the time-space continuum. What Donnie must now do is make a choice, a very important choice, determining the fate of humankind. I'll leave it there to not spoil the end.  This movie is right up my alley, anyway. The type of obscure, science-esque film that does not have a plot and/or meaning handed to you. The type of movie that you can't just sit back and switch your brain to the off position while watching. Then you throw the ideas of time travel, alternate existences, and tangent universes into the mix, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be gold to me!  Of course, this nowhere near even STARTS to tap into the intricate detail that this film presents to you, but to do that would require pages of writing. As for the graphical presentation of this movie, for a relatively low-budget film, it was top-notch. The special effects resembled those seen in high-budget hollywood sci-fi productions such as The Matrix. The camera angles and motion techniques used by the director were breathtaking, using wide, sweeping camera angles, a camera \\"one-eighty\\", a blue-masking effect overlaying the film, and subject transitions that some big-name directors would envy.  Talent - decent, but this is where some of the blank star is taken from. The only unconvincing role was Drew Barrymore, who I was never a huge fan of to start with, but her role is not very quintessential to the film besides the phrase \\"cellar door\\" (if you haven't seen the movie yet this won't make sense). Everyone else played the roles very convincingly except for one point, where Jake Gyllenhaal was with the character playing the psychiatrist and he was going into a panic mode -it was an abrupt transition and overly dramatic, making that a flaw in his acting. But I can live with that.  Soundtrack - one of the best ever. The music is used to great effect throughout the film to enhance the mood, a technique that is dying out in film productions nowadays. The Gary Jules cover of Tears for Fears' \\"Mad World\\" is better than the original, and at the moment it was used in the film, made me feel as though I've never felt before, if you know what I mean, and that feeling doesn't come easy for me when speaking of media or entertainment (I feel emotional usually with actual real people, I don't usually get way too emotional over media productions). Not only does this song chill you to the bone, but it actually describes the point of the film well, through the use of imagery.  All in all, it was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch - I beg the negative people to give this film another chance - watch it with an open mind and try to think for yourself for once. Try to break out of the concrete thinking mindset, that I once used to be in. I'm 16 going on 17 and have already shattered it. Believe me when you realize that this movie is meant for open-ended interpretation and how it makes you feel when it forces you to think, you will realize what a great movie it is and the positive connotation of it.
6305878323|4.0|I can never remember.  Julie Andrews sang a little song about \\"pouring out\\" when this first came out, but Disney cut most of the running tea gags on re-release -- so the whole teapot etiquette scene on Uncle Albert's ceiling is missing.  Maybe Juan Valdez slipped Mickey a little something under the table?   <br /> <br />Dick Van Dyke's ersatz cockney accent seems to have aged severely over the decades, although Uncle Albert is now clearly bipolar.  Four stars.  If Eisnerville ever re-releases the original, with the tea jokes intact, it might be a five again.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is great!!  It blows \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\" right out of the water!  From the first note on \\"Shut Up\\", to the last one on \\"Untitled\\" you go through such a range of emotions from saddness, to hurt, to wanting, to just plain wanting to jump!  I suggest everyone pick up a copy!
0060589272|4.0|I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Paolho Coelho. I've read 'The Alchimist' and 'Veronica decides to die' and formed quite a negative opinion about the author although there were some good moments in these books. What I didn't like most was his preachy and simple style of writing. Furthermore most of his books are very similar, only the context of the story and the characters vary. 'Chasing the dream' could be a slogan for all Coelho's writings. <br /> <br />I decided to read his latest book '11 Minutes' because I was told it was different and that the main characted was prostitute, so I made associations that finally Coelho has focused on the dark aspects of 'chasing the dream'. I would say that I was mostly right - maybe that's one of the things that made me like this book. <br /> <br />Maria is an ordinary beautiful Brasilian girl that goes to Switzerland to become a dancer, model or what could help in fulfilling her dream. But in the end she starts earning money as a prostitute. From that moment on the reader has a chance to enter her inner world - her thoughts about morality, about men and woman relations, and mostly about sex. Some very interesting areas are explored like why a man is ashamed when he pays for love? Isn't it the woman who should feel shame because sells her body? And so on... Maria is very prone to fall deep into mastering her behaviour towards men so that she could become professional prostitute. She really has a great potential in that. But she stumbles upon an artist that she falls in love with. That is one of the things that a professional prostitute shoud not let happen. This is the main crossroad for her - which one to choose - the profession which could help her earn enough money to go back home and buy a farm for her parents or to accept the true love? This is not an easy choice for her and it takes her quite a lot of time to take it.  <br /> <br />What astonished me pleasantly was the depth to which Coelho explores a woman's character and soul - much successfully, I think. Words about his knowledge of woman's heart prove to be not only empty talks. <br /> <br />It was definately interesting to me to read this book despite some moments that I find little boring.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I must say, this is one of the best cds I have picked up this year. I believe this is their best CD and I believe they will continue to grow as a band and just keep getting better with time. Label this band as whatever you wish, but if you are just looking for some good music then check this CD out. The best songs to me are \\"Shut up\\", \\"Perfect World\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Me Against the World\\", \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Untitled\\". Good stuff. :)
B000059QY3|4.0|Este dvd tiene su razon de ser en la interpretacion de Violetta Valery que brinda ANGELA GHEORGHIU. En estas funciones de 1994 la soprano rumana, entonces desconocida, asumio este papel en el Covent Garden bajo la direccion de SIR GEROG SOLTI (que es referencial por cierto) y el exito fue brutal: No es de extraar, ya que a sus geniales medios vocales (voz bella, coloratura facil, piani, fiato....) se une una presencia como actriz con una extraordinaria capacidad para transmitir y emocionar: Su Acto III es realmente de antologia.  <br />Lastima que todo lo demas no este a la altura. El Alfredo de FRANK LOPARDO posee una voz baritonal poco interesante, y esta algo forzado como actor, y el Germont de LEO NUCCI (que en principio deberia de ser de gran calidad) no tiene vocalmente su mejor dia. Competentes (nada mas) los secundarios. <br />La puesta en escena es bastante tradicional, correcta en conjunto, pero a mi personalmente solo me convence plenamente en el ultimo acto. <br />Pero pese a todo esto, Angela Gheorghiu y Georg Solti elevan el nivel del espectaculo hasta crear un bello documento que merece sin duda ser visto: Un gran director presentando a una gran estrella. No se lo pierdan. <br />

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray Charles is still on beat for the last CD of his work put out during his lifetime with Genius Loves Company. Ray was slowing down and getting older, yes, but wow, here Ray performs with all his heart and soul! Some may say that Ray's voice was not at its best for these recordings; and yes, maybe they're right. Nevertheless, Ray is still able to use that voice of his to express the wide range of emotions that come with love such as lust, longing, sadness, happiness and ecstasy. On this CD some of Ray's countless fans-who are also performers themselves-join with Ray to produce a good selection of beautiful duets!<br /><br />On this CD Ray starts out with the beautiful and romantic \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Norah Jones as his duet partner, \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" with James Taylor and then \\"You Don't Know Me\\" with Diana Krall. A strong start! Honestly, it's very tough for me to name a favorite duet of mine here; the song set is that good! The strong sales of this CD indicate that people are agreeing with me. Other great songs include \\"Fever\\" with Natalie Cole and \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" featuring Johnny Mathis. There's even a duet with Van Morrison; together they sing \\"Crazy Love.\\" The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />But there's more! This is an \\"enhanced\\" CD, which means there are multimedia files for your computer if you have one. If you don't have a computer, get this CD to a friend's computer and enjoy the extras-I'll keep them a pleasant surprise for you! GRIN<br /><br />Therefore, I highly recommend this CD for fans of this type of music, duets, and of course for Ray's fans, too! For the Ray Charles fan this CD is still very much a must have since the true fan never deserts their star even when the star begins to fade. Ray's contribution to the arts is truly phenomenal. His talent and legacy live on through his music and our memories of him.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd is full of great SP tracks I know everyone will enjoy. Even if you are not a SP fan already, or do not know who they are you should check them out! My favorite songs on the album are #2 \\"Welcome to my Life\\" (their single), #5 \\"Me against the World\\", #6 \\"Crazy\\", and #10 \\"One.\\" You should listen to all of those tracks and you'll find they will become your favorites too. Simple Plan is my favorite band hoepefully it will become yours through this cd!!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is an exciting review to write since this is the 30th anniversary edition of a classic, timeless rock album with very few rivals ever. There is no doubt: Dark Side of the Moon is the rare album the value of which time could never make obsolete. Pink Floyd labored, sweated, struggled, and thought very creatively to produce an album (and CD) that will always live on. The album and new 30th anniversary artwork are powerful, relevant to the struggles people have in life throughout time, and incredibly entertaining, to say the least. Look at the proof: even though the band wrote the music and lyrics in 1972 and early 1973, it still sells very well decades later! They even keep re-releasing the CD even as they continue to sell the previous edition of the CD! GRIN<br /><br />The music is stunning; there are guitar solos, background singers, biting social commentaries about the rat race and money, and lyrics that are so simply written yet capable of saying something about us all and the band's sadness over Syd Barrett's drug problems. (Syd Barrett was a Pink Floyd band member who had left by this point.) The music quality is excellent and greatly enhanced by the technology used to produce this CD; but I'll say more about that later.<br /><br />The album begins with a man's voice talking about being mad (as in crazy) and ends with a man's voice saying how the moon is completely dark, which reflects the band's pessimistic commentary on life. This man's negativity also reflects Syd Barrett's troublesome drug addiction.<br /><br />Between that beginning and end there's a song set that blows your mind--and you don't have to be a kid experimenting with drugs in the 1970s to agree with this! In fact there's so much excellent and unique material I don't know where to begin! \\"Money\\" is perhaps my favorite song; there's an excellent saxophone solo there and the greed we can all succumb to is lamented but with music that makes you want to listen to the song to enjoy it over and over again. \\"Us And Them\\" is a song that decries the evils of war; at the time it could well have referred to the then current Vietnam War but this sad ballad can describe any conflict. The song \\"Breathe\\" laments the stress of life.<br /><br />There are also excellent sound effects on this album (now, of course, here on SACD technology CD). There are sounds of footsteps, for example, and airplanes for added effect in the song \\"On The Run.\\" The song \\"Time\\" begins with \\"the chimes,\\" as one friend of mine once said; you hear the sounds of bells ringing to emphasize the passage of time.<br /><br />Not only is this music so damn good you'll NEVER want to put this CD away, there's much more as well: you get terrific pictures of the band members in both color and black and white. The full lyrics and credits are provided which is always a nice plus. The artwork on the insert is excellent as well. Then of course there's the infamous cover art of the triangle doubling as a prism turning white light into a rainbow.<br /><br />AND, here's a great upgrade of the CD released previously: because it uses \\"super audio CD\\" technology, the sound quality is simply unsurpassed! You can play this CD in your home theater system on or a DVD player that is SACD compatible. Even in just your regular CD player the improved surround sound quality is obvious from the moment you play it --you'll swear the whole band was turned back in time to 1972 and that they're playing personally just for you in your living room! The sounds such as the heartbeat become more intense and dramatic because of the clarity. There's cool new artwork, too!<br /><br />I don't think there's any reason why a rock and roll fan should hesitate to buy this CD! Indeed, the original Dark Side of the Moon was on the charts (\\"Billboard's\\") for an astounding fourteen years which I highly doubt too many, if any, other albums can claim. Buy this newly improved CD, treasure it as you can only truly treasure a very few CDs, and playit and enjoy it for many years to come! Introduce it to newcomers, too, so they can experience an incredible CD!ew CDs, and play it and enjoy it for many years to come!

B0002KVULG|5.0|This version of Dracula is one of the best. The color has been \\"drained\\" no pun intended from the film, but NOT ALL OF THE COLOR. It's just not sickly-bright with colors. It's more like a very dusty, gray, and cold day in New England, and that my readers can and is very creepy. Initially, I did miss the blood red and blood shot eyes of Mina and Lucy (now more like a deep reddish-brown color, but the film is so stunningly dark and the music by John Williams so rich and beautiful, it cancelled out all my concern for this version of the film. This is better version in my opinion. This is a very sexy Dracula, and it's more intellectual than most \\"other\\" Dracula movies. The acting by the entire cast is really refreshing, very professional and believable. It's good to see a Dracula movie that is not too humorous. Although there is humor in it, it is very subtle. If you want a creepy and sexy Dracula, this one is for you. Give it a try, it's really a modern-classic, and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD with its re-mastered version in every sense of the word. SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE DARK with someone special (romantic). It's going to be a good night with this version of Dracula. Oh, and bring some wine to this dark and romantically gothic movie.

B00002E23E|5.0|Potential viewers shouldn't be deterred by pointless and ridiculous commentaries of seemingly short-attention-spanned reviewers who like other bands anyway and shouldn't bother writing about Led Zeppelin.This movie was meant to present the four individuals of the band in a collective context,therefore each group memeber is showcased in the live footage and in a fantasy sequence.The original three-hour concert is not fully used,instead relevant parts where interwoven with off-stage scenes,hence creating a closer outlook on each individual.Jimmy Page is featured on 'Dazed And Confused'(where he plays a sort of warlock),Robert Plant on the \\"double header\\" 'Song Remains/Rain Song'(with an Arthurian character),John Bonham on 'Moby Dick'(he preferred an honest,family-and-friends environment) and John Paul Jones on 'No Quarter'(presenting himself as a man with two faces,one as a musician and one as a\\"pater familias\\").The live footage is superb and so is the playing.Critics of the era always stated the difference between the heavily orchestrated studio versions and the four-piece live arragements,often calling them \\"thin\\";their gullable readers trusted this assumptions and not their ears,and the accusation is present to this day.I'm not old enough to have seen Led Zeppelin Live but I have read such articles and I do trust my ears and you can trust yours by listening to this DVD,its soundtrack,the Led Zeppelin DVD and 'How The West Was Won' on CD,you'll be able to tell if live Led Zeppelin is worthy of the legend they created.The marvellous renditions of 'Since I've Been Loving You','Stairway','No Quarter',the title track,'Dazed','Heartbreaker/Whole Lotta Love' and the sheer power of the band on stage in '73 are enough reasons to purchase this DVD.There's a criticism by someone who claims to have seen Zeppelin in '77,if you want to experience the awesome power of the band in '77 go to the Led Zeppelin DVD,on disc two select promos and the menu is a bootleg recording of the June 21st concert at the L.A. Forum with accompanying bootleg footage(from Birmingham and NY),listen an marvel at it(the picture is not very good but the audio is excellent,that is why it was relegated to a menu feature).The only drawbacks in the movie are the re-enacment of some bits-mostly close-ups(Page had to struggle with gaps in the footage to match with the audio) that are only apparent by very close inspection.Also the audio editting suffers somewhat when matching,almost by force,some scenes.This does not occur on the soundtrack where such limitations where not imposed by the lack of visuals.Also the output of the DVD is not as loud as the Led Zeppelin DVD,but the '76 mixing work is outstanding.Another inhibiting factor is that the fantasy sequences are shown during some instrumentals,and songs like 'Over The Hills',although played at this concerts of July '73 when the shooting of the film took place,were discarded.This DVD is a great remnant of the Led Zeppelin experience.Miss it at your own risk.
B000060P79|3.0|1. I'd Do Anything: For awhile this was my favorite song period, and it's one of the best on the album. It has Mark Hoppus from Blink-182. 9/10 <br />2. The Worst Day Ever: Not the most original song ever, but has a good beat. 8/10 <br />3. You Don't Mean Anything: Chorus can get a little bit annoying. And I don't see what the point of having Joel Madden on it when you can barely hear him. But a good song in general. 8/10 <br />4. I'm Just a Kid: This and number two have alomst indentical plots, but the video for this is pretty funny. 8/10 <br />5. When I'm With You: About some girl but has some cool guitar parts in it. And catchy. 7/10 <br />6. Meet You There: KInd of a sad song, I guess. But it's okay even though I don't usually listen to it. 7/10 <br />7. Addicted: I love how they tricked the FCC into letting them say \\"I'm addic...\\" on the radio. Ha ha! 9/10 <br />8. My Alien: By far, the stupidest song on the CD. Matbe it was supposed to be a joke but, its not that funny. 5/10 <br />9. God Must Hate Me: A song that most teenagers can relate to. One of the best songs on the CD. 10/10 <br />10. I Won't Be There: The first time I heard this I thought the line \\"cause when you wake up I won't be there.\\" was really strange. 7/10 <br />11. One Day: Just a song about how he knows one day he won't have to listen to his parents anymore. What ever poed teenager wants to sing to their parents. 9/10 <br />12. Perfect: How he sometimes feels that parents want him to be perfect. Just what the title says. Good song though. 9/10 <br />13. Track 13: The first song is my favorite song because it pretty much decribes me. And the second is pretty good too. 10/10 <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|I'd say that this album is soo awesome. First of all, TWO THUMBS UP to the dual disc. That is so cool! Let's talk about the CD side first. These songs are all real and all related to life as a teenager. We all go through this at some point or the other.  <br />The DVD: Making of the record was hilarious. I had a good laugh. I love the fact that they write all their own songs. We can see from this video that it isn't always an easy task to find lyrics but they always manage to write a good song in the end. The photos are awesome. <br /> <br />I love everything about this CD. It's one of those CDs that you wanna listen to and you wanna pass on to your kids. Get it!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is old fashioned. At the cinema every other movie goer was a woman a so I was glad to be with my wife. (the term chick-flick (lol) has already been used in this review section! - but it is interesting that guys are watching too) <br />Call it a tearjerker but movies like this are so rare these days it is very refreshing! <br />This movie captures the heart and truly amazes. I had no expectations when I went to see it. The movie opening credits were a bore, but, I got hooked pretty easily after that. <br />The story is a best-seller so it stands to reason that the movie can tell a good story too. Must see, don't listen to anyone that says not to watch it, they are pulling the wool over your eyes. <br />What I liked about this movie (the story really, but the movie production was fine and well shot and casted) is that the story was unpredictable. Most films these days are very poor in this department. I enjoyed it and it touches the heart! Great for couples, chicks (lol) and guys who want to enjoy a good movie. (Don't expect to get into it straight away, it takes a little time.)
B000002H2H|5.0|All those arguments between pro and anti Metallica fans below are disappointing. They do no justice to this album. <br /> <br />I'll admit to not being a serious metal or Metallica fan. But that didn't stop me from being blown away when I heard this album. In my honest and humble opinion, it is this album, Master of Puppets and ... And Justice For All that can be considered Metallicas best works. The rest of it can be canned ;-) <br /> <br />No seriously. This is one fantastic album. Fade to Black has got to be one of the best ballads out there ever. I don't agree a lot with Metallica and once I listen to albums like this, I am more than disappointed with their current works and releases. <br /> <br />Long time Metallica fans have my sympathy. The band has apparently lost it's direction (and some say talent). Thankfully, we can all put on records like this one, and regain our faith and hope.
0345350499|5.0|I loved this book so much that I had to buy it for most of my friends and family members. Mists has been criticized for being too long and unweildy, too feminist and historically inaccurate. Except for the last I disagree. The novel is long, but its worth it. Bradley could have tied the story up more quickly, but she would have been cheating the reader of some great plot and character developement. Because the book follows the lives of several women close to the legendary Arthur, Igraine his mother, Morgaine his sister, Gwenafar his wife, and Morgause his aunt, the length was necessary; the book followed most of these women throughout their entire lives. The book certainly does have feminist characteristics, but it doesn't bog it down. The book is about women after all and a Goddess-worshipping religion; what did you expect? I can't attest to whether or not it's historically accurate, but since it's fiction, I was willing to play along. <br /> <br />I loved that this book was a new twist on a old legend and that Bradley wasn't afraid to have her characters be flawed. Every major character could be loved and hated for some reason; true to life she didn't play into the idea of strict good and evil, but rather she left most things a shade of gray. She also brought out the drama of the dying of one religion and the coming of a new. <br /> <br />I would recommend this for readers who aren't afraid of long books and are paitent enough to see the book through. It's well worth the wait.
B0000057C5|4.0|When \\"Du Hast\\" hit the airwaves here in Chicago IL it was insane! Chicago could not get enough if its intense driving sound! Who cared it it was in German?! We loved it - It rocked! I'll never forget it. Then a couple months later the radio station annouced it has Du Hast released in English. 3 words OH MY GOD! I think the entire city fo Chicago agreed its sucked! It did not translate well. And we never heard another thing - at least not on Chicago airwaves. <br />To this day I will never forget the impact Rammstein had on Chicago that year. I personally didn't care what they were saying - it sounded awesome. Then somebody had to go & translate it - and it was the downfall of the album & Rammsteins success here in Chicago. Why take a good thing & turn it inside out & ruin it? If you have nothing better to do than go around tranlating every word of Rammsteins lyrics then you need to get a life! You need to appreciate the band for who & what they are - a GERMAN METAL BAND  - THATS SINGS IN GERMAN! What are you going to go translate TNT's orignal CD that is in Norweign next?  <br />
0553573403|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down! Martin is a skillful writer and his world is a refreshing mix of history and fantasy without any cliches.<br /><br />Martin tells the story of a kingdom on the brink of war where the politics are as deadly as the impending long winter. He uses the perspectives of several different characters switching back and forth each chapter. At first I thought this would hinder the narrative, but I was wrong. Martin gives each character a distinct voice and each chapter leaves you in suspense as you jump around his kingdom.<br /><br />This is low magic fantasy set in a medieval-esque world, complete with knights, maesters (sort of like mages) and a few dragons to spice things up. I highly recommend this book and the others in the series.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I must say, even though I was already blown away by Simple Plan's first album, that this CD definitely exceeded my expectations! The themes in the songs are much deeper, this album is more mature, & has a more rocking, alternative sound (not as poppy). The album is still catchy & there is no way that you won't find yourself singing along with Pierre. I haven't took it out of my CD player since I got it! So....what are you waiting for? BUY IY NOW! You WON'T be dissapointed!
1400032717|4.0|Actually I would give this one 4.5 stars if I could. Haddon's book is original and endearing; it's narrated by an austitic boy whose quest to find out who killed the neighbor's dog leads him to make shocking discoveries about his own family. Parts of this book made me laugh out loud and parts made me want to cry. Christopher helps open the readers eyes to the fact that having a disability doesn't mean leading a less fulfilling life.  <br /> <br />It's definately worth the read, and it's a quickie too; I finished in one night. I would also recommend this title for high school aged readers and book clubs.

From phony car chase scenes where the action is sped up and quick turns are made over the top of 50 pre-existing sets of black rubber on the highway to the ridiculous improv mugging of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise who seem to think that because they make each other laugh that they are actually funny this movie seems to say \\"You are stupid enough to have paid to see this crapball that we are going to refuse to put any effort into entertaining you.\\" If your idea of humor is DeLuise morphing into a fat superhero cleverly referred to as Captain Chaos, or Him and characters who not only drive drunk but actually flaunt their cocktails/beer when pulled over by police then you will pee your pants with glee when watching this movie. It's difficult to determine who phones in the worst acting performance in Cannonball Run: Farrah Fawcett who seems to be under the influence of bus fumes throughout; Burt Reynolds whose lack of self-awareness is almost frightening; Dom DeLuise who apparently didn't realize the camera was rolling in his scenes; Dean Martin/Sammy Davis Jr. who pass off their drunken rat pack stage antics as acting or Adrienne Barbeau who flashes her prodigious bosoms to every cracker state trooper in the country. It's difficult to decide what element of crapness is the most frustrating: The fact that no matter where in the country the action is supposed to be taking place it looks like Barstow; the car chase that conveniently supplies a ramp to jump the train (which conveniently has a long row of flatbed cars just as the truck approaches the ramp) or the seemingly endless number of scenes where one of the \\"racers\\" has been pulled over by the (usually dimwitted and incompetent) local authorities. Like \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", Cannonball Run has that slapped together in 4 days of shooting feel. As though Hal Needham was oblivious to what was happening and just shouting \\"Print it.\\" My favorite example is the scene where Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise land a plane in a small town's downtown area. Barricades and crowds just happen to already exist as the plane lands. When the plane takes off check out the left side of the shot as a cameraman is obviously apparent standing on a stairway. To sum up, this movie really irks me with its complete lack of regard to everything moviemaking stands for. And writer Brock Yates has tried to divorce himself from this movie claiming that it was taken in a different direction than he has intended. C'mon Brock, the scenes where you appear at the beginning of the race would seem to indicate you were \\"acting\\" of your own accord (no pun intended.) So spare yourself the time of buying this stinkbomb and just flush a $10 bill down the toilet instead.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and it is ranked one of my top 10 all time favorites.  Tom Hanks does an excellent job expressing himself.  I laugh out loud every time I watch this movie.  His laugh is so contagious especially in the bathtub scene, one can't help but to laugh along with him.  This movie is an excellent film for the whole family, one that stands the test of time.  Buy it, watch it, memorize it!
0142004235|5.0|I've crossed another classic off of my \\"to read\\" list, and boy am I happy I read this one. This was pure satisfaction from start to finish. John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an amazing book that embodies the intersection of literary weightiness and readability. There are plenty of epics out there that span generations: Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds or Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits, for example. Those books are a joy to read and you can luxuriate in the authors' virtuosity as characters are added to weaving storylines, but East of Eden seemed to have more weight to it. Unlike many epics, which to thrive on love, unrequited or forbidden, Steinbeck's book focuses on the struggles of brothers seeking their father's admirmation. From the title alone, it is obvious that this notion is Biblical, and the book's Biblical quality becomes its center. For the first time in a very long time, I did not rush through the book's last chapters, eager to get to my next conquest. I felt that pang that you sometimes get when you finish a truly magnificent book, the pang that is part sadness at the experience of reading the book being over and part a feeling of that book permanently lodging itself in your memory to be drawn from and remembered with reverence. There are, I think, very few books that can produce this sublime reading experience, but East of Eden is on that short list.
B00005AAFS|4.0|Third album from German band Rammstein. Before I heard the first single from Mutter \\"Sonne\\" I already knew the band slightly. I really liked the song and therefore I bought the single. After that I bought the album Mutter and later on also Live Aus Berlin, Herzeleid and Sehnsucht.     On the first two albums Herzeleid and Sehnsucht, the band combines simple but effective marching guitars riffs, expressive vocals and techno/industrial-influenced keyboards. On Mutter, the first two elements are still present. The techno and industrial influenced keyboards are largely replaced by Gothic/Classic sounds. The keyboard-sound gives the album a warmer atmosphere. The songs on Mutter sound more mature, have better arrangements, are more vocal orientated and are less fast and heavy than on the first two albums. The sound-production is also better than on earlier releases. The sound of the first song \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" immediately blows you away. It is a superb mid-tempo song. I really like the classical music sounds in this song. \\"     Although the songs are generally slower than on Herzeleid and Sehnsucht, `Links 2 3 4\\", \\"Feuer Frei\\" and \\"Adios\\" prove that the band can still play fast and aggressive music. \\"Links 2 3 4\\" is a reaction to people who think that the band-members are racists. \\"Adios\\" is one of the few Rammstein songs that contains fast riffs without the typical Rammstein groove. It also contains on of the few solos that the band have ever played. \\"Nebel\\" and \\"Mutter\\" can be considered as ballads. Especially \\"Nebel\\" can musically be compared with \\"Seemann\\" from Herzeleid and \\"Klavier\\" from Sehnsucht. Its is an almost over-the-the top epic ballad.         If you like the two previous albums, you will enjoy Mutter. I personally prefer Herzeleid and especially Sehnsucht over Mutter. I miss the keyboard style of the previous albums. I also think that the previous albums had more interesting/weird musical twist and turns. \\"Spieluhr\\" is one of the few songs on Mutter that contains interesting twists and turns. Especially the twisted child vocals and the disturbing piano parts make the song interesting. It is therefore my favourite song on the album. Mutter is an excellent album and therefore a must have for people who like heavy, groovy Metal, plenty of keyboard sounds, confronting lyrics about disturbing society issues and expressive vocals.
0156027321|5.0|Ok, ok, no movie is in the works that I know of...but I'd be first in line to see it if they made one!!     I loved this book.  After dredging through the first 100 pages (religion, zoo stuff, blah blah blah), I couldn't put it down for the remainder of the story (lost at sea with a tiger (!) for 200+ days, wow!).  Pi was thirsty, I was thirsty.  Pi was bored, I was bored.  Pi was hungry, I was hungry.  Etc, etc, etc.  I knew all along it was fiction, but Martel's writing kept me wishing it were real!     The best part of this book...it was FICTION.  But, Martel made me question whether or not the FICTION was true!  Amazing!  Just amazing!  Reading this didn't make me belive in God, but it sure made me belive in the power of fiction!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by this reader.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!
B00005K9LN|4.0|In the seventies Judas Priest still played blues based Heavy Metal. British Steel was Judas Priest's first album in the eighties. The album sounds totally different, than their first albums. Gone are the bluesy elements and gone are the complex songs. British Steel is heavy influenced by The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. I personally, miss the warm sound of the seventies albums. The reason why I dislike a lot of '80 albums is because of the thin and cold sound most '80 records have. Besides the cold and thin sound I also miss songs with more complex twists and turns like older songs such as \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" and \\"Victim Of Changes\\". Most songs on British Steel have one main idea and a guitar solo. There is not a lot of room for interesting lengthy instrumental parts.  <br /> <br />British Steel was an important album for the band because the album made them very popular. Although I think that it is far from Priest's best album, it is considered as one of Priest's best albums. There are plenty of songs that can be considered as (live) classics. \\"Breaking The Law\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\" are the two most well known songs on the album. The songs are short but catchy. Every real Metal fan knows these songs. Check out the cool video for \\"Breaking The Law\\" on the DVD Electric Eye.  <br /> <br />\\"Rapid Fire\\" and \\"The Rage\\" are musically the most interesting songs. \\"Rapid Fire\\" is a fast and brutal song that can be categorized as an early attempt to play Speed Metal. Check out the cool solos in the song. \\"The Rage\\" is a pretty unusual song for Priest. It is a slow song with a haunting atmosphere. It is one of the few Judas Priest songs that start with a bass intro. \\"Grinder\\" and \\"Metal Gods\\" both are heavy mid-tempo tracks. \\"Metal Gods\\" contains a cool marching sound, that blends perfectly with the pace of the music . \\"United\\" is the worst song on the album. It is probably one of the worst Priest songs off all time. It is a drumbeat-orientated song. Especially the crowd vocals at the end of the song are horrible. <br /> <br />\\"British Steel\\" is an album that contains the highest percentage of Priest classics. Therefore it is a must have Priest album. Especially the albums British Steel, Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith can be seen as three typical eighties Judas priest albums. If you don't have British Steel but like the other two albums, then you should buy British Steel.         <br />I highly recommend this album for people who like classic eighties like Iron Maiden and Saxon. If you are new to Priest then check out their best of album Metal Works. It is a two cd that features the Priest period '77-'93. It logically contains plenty of British Steel songs. <br />
B0002EXFNI|1.0|comedy-entertainment consisting of jokes and sketches intended to make an audience laugh. <br /> <br />\\"The Girl Next Door\\" had jokes and it had sketches, but did I laugh? The answer to that question is no! It was shame too, because it had such a great idea, but it was not exacuted properly at all. The entire movie just tried to be as dirty as possible, and that's how these kind of movies should work. This is the movie that \\"American Pie\\" was smart enough to stay away from. At least that movie had a little heart, and whenever this movie tried to have some heart. . . it did it in a dirty way. I'm sure alot of people would like it better than I did, but this was just painful to watch. Typical teen movie acting to-bad. The best preformance came from Timolthy Olyphant, because he had some charm, and I believed him throughout the movie.  <br /> <br />The movie stars Emile Hirsch as Matthew, a senior in high school, who hangs out with friends Klitz and Eli. All three of them are pretty much obsessed with sex and everything about it, but of course they don't have any experience in the act. So, they make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. . . no I'm kidding. Matthew finds out that his next door neighbor is having their house watched by Danielle. She and Matthew begin to hang with each other, and they begin to develop some kind of relationship. That is, until his friends make a shocking discovery. They find out that Danielle was a former porn star, and when she finds out that he knows, he is only disappointed for her. They relationship faulters, and when she is taken away by her producer Kelly to the convention with all of the other porn stars. Matthew goes to rescue her, but Kelly doesn't like that because she is a big money-maker in the business, so he decides to destroy Matthrew through his school work, including taking the money that was going to bring a foreign exchange student into the country, and through his affection for Danielle. <br /> <br />Don't be asucker for an idea, it's how the movie works, and \\"The Girl Next Door\\" doesn't work at all. First Matthew and Danielle like each other, then she doesn't like him, then she likes him again. It keeps changing, and it becomes hard to root for them to be together, but in the end, you just don't care. The laughs are not to be had in this movie, and from the very beginning I saw a rocky future ahead. Elisha Cuthburt is overrated, in both looks and acting, and I don't see much coming for her. This is by far, at this point, the worst movie of the year, and I could feel so many young adults reading this right now and yelling at me. If this was rewritten a few more times, and maybe a few better people could have made it work a little bit more, but with the finished material, I could only give it one star, which is rare for me. I hated, hated, hated, this movie. I didn't like it, but you might. <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated R for strong sexual content, language and some drug/alcohol use.
B00004Z400|5.0|Every DEFTONES album ever made is worth the money. No filler here, people. There were 2 before this and one after with another on the way, and if you don't own them yet - GET THEM! You hear me? Don't steal them, don't 'borrow' them -- BUY THEM! This band is worth the money. Others may come and go, but Chino's voice will always be sexy.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|\\"Team America: World Police\\" is the new movie from Matt Stone and Trey Parker. If you never heard of them before, they are the creators of \\"South Park.\\" That is an animated show, that started off with small pieces of construction paper. This one could also be considered an animated movie, except it is done with puppets. Everyone and everything is part of this puppet world, and although the movie is about the war on terrorism, it never touches the government. There is no puppet version of President George W Bush or Saddam Hussain. This movie hits the war from the point of the actors that really think they could make a difference. Actors like Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and even Micheal Moore, who actually causes all of the trouble. The villan is even the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, who is using this actors in order to lead the terrorists to victory. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest people around right now, and everything about this movie is funny, and raunchy. The commericals don't really have anything funny, but that is because everything that is funny can't be shown on television. Everything that we think is funny, is funnier because of the puppets. They fight by bumping into each other, they could be in a serious scene, and then they walk away, but the way they walk into straight, or proper at all. You could do whatever you want with puppets. You could fill them up with as much fake blood as you want, or even liquid that looks like vomit. But, it's alot of work, and I don't think that they would ever try to do it again. <br /> <br />The movie begins in Paris, and the terrorists have plotted a bomb. Luckily, Team America is ready, and they go to Paris to destory the terrorists, while also destorying Paris. They stopat nothing to defeat evil. They meet in Mount Rushmore, led by Spottswoode, and there is Carson, Lisa, Chris, Joe, and Sarah, and just as Carson proposes to Lisa, he is shot and killed by a terrorist. With the loss of Carson, they must replace him with somebody who could pretend to be a terrorist, so they hire Gary, a Broadway actor, who is known for the hit song \\"Everyone Has AIDS.\\" He doesn't want the job, but when he realizes that \\"Freedom Isn't Free\\" he takes it. He dresses up as a terrorists, filled with facial hair, and heads over to the Middle East. But Kim Jong Il is really the villan, and he is using the Hollywood actors to get the terrorist activity around  the world. As Lisa doesn't want to get attached to another person for fear of losing him, strife comes to the Team America headquarters. What makes things worse is the headquarters gets hit with a bomb, and the Team America gang gets captured, and it's up to Gary to save the day. <br /> <br />As I said, everything is funnier when it is done with puppets, and sex is not an exception. There is a hilarious graphic puppet sex scene that takes about forty five seconds long. It was edited a few times, so hopefully on the DVD we could see everything. This movie is not a movie where Matt or Trey voice their beliefs about the war, but it is a movie that is about them thinking that actors think they are better then everybody else, and that they know more. I love what they do to them, and I love all the movie references. I'm sure somethings went over my head, and that means other people too, but you have to always pay attention during this movie. Even the song lyrics have comedy in them, and I love the lament of Kim Jong Il. It fits it perfectly. \\"Team America: World Police\\" is a great movie, and it is the funniest of the year. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses. <br /> <br />And remember. . . America! F**k yeah! <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated R for graphic, crude & sexual humor, violent images & strong language, all involving puppets.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I was already an Avril Lavigne fan when I bought the album, but when I bought it and listened to it once the whole way through, I was truly exhilarated!!! Avril's newest single, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; has been my favorite song since May! When she let it out into a single, I said it was the best thing it could do to make her career even stronger than it already was. I just recently saw her LIVE in concert, and she sang 10 tracks off of Under MY Skin. This is the BEST cd by Avril Lavigne, and I think even possibly by a Canadian artist. This CD really deserves much more than 5 stars. Really, it deserves 10 stars. If you don't already have this CD, where have you been? Go out and buy it right now!!!
0312995423|2.0|This book was full of plot twists and turns and was also a fast read. But upon finishing it, it seemed more to me like a silly, little computer story. I knew I was reading a fictional story, but it was a little far-fetched. I also agree with another reviewer that it read more like a screenplay than a book. But the story was entertaining and made my travels go by quicker. So if you are looking for some light, entertaining reading that goes by quick, this would be a great book. It is also a good book to start with before reading any of Dan Brown's other books as he definitely has his own writing style!
B0002YLC24|5.0|I never heard of \\"Before Sunrise\\" until this sequel came out.  My wife and I watched both on DVD back to back. Boy, we were moved!  The most intelligent movie dialogue I have ever seen/heard. Thought provoking, smart, humorous, and romantic!  Julie Delpy's acting is unforgettable. After watching these two movies, most of Hollywood romantic movies seem so shallow.     Can the director made another sequal please?
B0002MB7QW|3.0|My 12 year old rented this movie and I watched it with him.  I had heard somethings about it when it came out.  As I recall, there was some controversy over how the movie portrayed the Global Warming theory and the official reaction to it by the Executive Branch of the US Government.  As I watched it, I was reminded of another movie my son had brought home; \\"The Core\\".  Both movies start out with a compelling series of unexplainable phenomenon.  Both then delve into an unbelievable (literally) scientific explanation proposed by an up and coming expert who becomes our hero.  Both then change our focus from the total destruction of the earth and all of its' contents and turn it to the lives of a handful of people.   <br /> <br />I found \\"The Core\\" to actually be more believable than \\"The Day After Tommorrow\\" even though \\"TDAT\\" is based on a widely accepted scientific doomsday theory (which, unless I skipped the wrong Evening News broadcast, is not the case with \\"The Core\\").  I guess the problem with the application of the Global Warming theory in this movie is that it totally discredits the theory.  It does so by suggesting a cataclysmic surge of changes rather than the gradual changes that would occur with a slow but steady rise in the average annual temperature.  It takes the possible and gives us the impossible.  That's OK for the sake of making an exciting disaster movie but it destroys any relevance to possible legitimate issues of our day.  Thus I didn't understand the controversy since the movie makes a joke of Global Warming. <br /> <br />All politics aside, the movie asks us to focus our attention on a father's search for his adult son while the rest of America is essentially being destroyed.  It's a nice relationship that they have but is this how the world ends; not with a bang but with a reunion?   <br /> <br />OK, so if you just want to relax your brain and enjoy the special affects that Hollywood can come up with these days, \\"The Day After Tommorrow\\" isworthwhile to watch.  The kids will love it but I expect a bit more out of a movie than this. <br /> <br />
0792833279|5.0|After winning one or more Oscars for his role in 1994's PULP FICTION,John Travolta's film career was refilled with \\"high Travoltage\\". Following PF,Travolta relentlessly made at least one film year after year. This film was his first post-PF one. ADDAMS FAMILY director Barry Sonnenfeld had a great cast in this film which includes Gene Hackman,Danny DeVito,Rene Russo and Dennis Farina. In one scene,Ernest \\"Chili\\" Palmer(Travolta) returns some stolen money to an airport where it was stored. The money was stolen by Leo DeVoe(David Paymer) and was added to his casino winnings($10,000). Chili borrows the money Leo won and promised him he'd later repay it. In one of the first scenes,Ray Barboni(Farina) enters a restaurant where Chili is dining. Ray tells his buddies with him,\\"It's Chili outside and it's Chili inside. It's a regular f---ing Chilifest!\\". Hackman is Harry Zimm,a film producer for his own company,Zimm Productions. In another scene,Harry tells Ray on the phone,\\"Harry Zimm tells you the way it is!\\". Russo is Karen Flores,an actress. Chili befriends Karen in the film. DeVito is Martin \\"Shorty\\" Weir,also an actor. Chili was looking for Martin so Martin could appear in one of Harry's future films. Also in the phone conversation between Harry and Ray,Harry tells Ray,\\"You've never been out of f---ing Miami,dips--t!\\" after Ray tells Harry that Ray never heard of Harry Zimm(Ray didn't know at the time he was actually talking to Harry). Ray was sitting on the toilet when Harry phoned! Also in the film is Delroy Lindo,whose character is a hitman who assassinates a young Hispanic man named Yayo(Jacob Vargas). Yayo was about to repay money to his uncle Escobar(Miguel Sandoval). Ray leaves Miami for Los Angeles to meet Harry. Harry,napping at his desk,asked who was knocking on his door. \\"The dips--t who's never been out of Miami!\\",Ray tells Harry. Harry suggests to Ray he partake in joint ownership of one of Harry's future films,investing some money in it(what Chili owes Ray). Ray was looking for Chili and Leo. Leo died in a plane crash while returning to Miami from Las Vegas. Ray beats up Harry so badly that Harry ends up in a hospital bed. Other memorable scenes include Ray being shot in the nose by Chili. Also physically abusive Ray punches Leo's widow in the face. Paymer had a short role in one of Travolta's earlier films,1985's PERFECT. Hackman won an Oscar for 1971's THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Russo's other films include MR. DESTINY,TIN CUP,OUTBREAK,LETHAL WEAPON 3 and 4 and SHOWTIME. Farina's other films include MIDNIGHT RUN,ANOTHER STAKEOUT,STEALING HARVARD,SNATCH,STRIKING DISTANCE and THAT OLD FEELING. DeVito's other films include THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN,TWINS,JUNIOR,RENAISSANCE MAN and THE WAR OF THE ROSES. After this film,Travolta starred in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN,BROKEN ARROW,ISN'T SHE LOVELY,FACE OFF,A CIVIL ACTION,PRIMARY COLORS,THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,SWORDFISH,WINNING NUMBERS,PHENOMENON and MICHAEL. Great film!
B00005JKED|5.0|As I write this, I have just finished watching this movie for the 6th time, and it won't be the last. Think Denzel is just typecast to portray \\"good\\" guys? HA! Think again. In this film, Denzel's character, \\"Alonzo\\" is grittier and more sinister than the supposed criminals he and his partner are pursuing. I put this movie in my own \\"gangster\\" Hall of fame along with \\"Scarface\\", \\"Goodfellas\\", and \\"New Jack City\\", among many..
B00005JNEI|5.0|The film brings up a lot of things like the alleged connections between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family etc etc that I don't personally believe and are impossible to prove anyways. There's some of that, great, leaders and leader's supporters should be able to take criticism anyways. <br /> <br />But, the one thing it does superbly is show viewers how war really, really, REALLY is unpleasant. For the soldiers, families, and for civilians who get in the way. This movie made me cry, and it made a lot of people cry (those who weren't already starting the liberal bashing, that is). It also makes, or should make, you think; think if war is necessary or worth it, worth the cost, the chaos, and, most of all, the human suffering. <br /> <br />Also, being moderatley distrustful or cynical of your government is a healthy thing. It forces you, if you wish to have a good argument, to look the facts up yourself, to learn and make your own opinions, which I hope this film drives people to do. <br /> <br />So, 4 stars for content and 1 for guts- because now half the country is calling him a fat, stupid, communist...*gasp* LIBERAL!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.  After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film.  One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction.  This is something to think about when you watch this edition.  The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change.  Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer.  That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities.  He does this by adding chapters from the book \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences.  Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality.  This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.<br /><br />There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie.  We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist.  There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition.  I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original.  There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.  This powerfully sealed the film for me.  It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him.  It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place.<br /><br />Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.  The way the director wanted it to be.  We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake.  The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film.  Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song \\"Mad, Mad World\\"?  It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film.  Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel?  The truth is out there?  Not unless you have seen this film.  There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film.  This was not the case here.  Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story.  The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch.  It will be up to you to see if this is true or not.<br /><br />Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list.  I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut.  It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come.  You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today.  It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.<br /><br />You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****nally put into place.   <br /> <br />Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.

B000060OFT|5.0|The first time that I saw this movie was in the 7th grade. I own the DVD now and everytime I see it I find something new to pay attention to. This isn't a movie for everyone. You either love it or hate it. I have many reasons for liking this movie: <br />1. It is a love story, and not just a run of the mill love story, but a great one. I am mush when it comes to this type of stuff.  <br />2. I see beauty in ruoghness, destruction, pain, misery, and tragedy. By placing it in a modern time the effect of the roughness is much greater for me than it would have been in period costume. I think that the director did an amazing job in adapting the story to the modern scene. <br />3. Along with the roughness comes the contrasting beauty of love and of Romeao and Juliet. Esthetically, both DiCaprio and Danes make a beautiful pair. The acting could have been better, but this is not to say that it was bad. Just subpar. <br />4. Mercucio was amazing.  <br />5. The old English hit me hard the first time I saw it. It didn't quite fit at first but after half the movie I got so used to it that after the movie I was speaking old English myself. Actually, I shouldn't call it old English since Shakespear is considered to have written in modern English. A technicality. I liked the contrast. <br /> <br />Overall, I loved the contrasts in this movie. They lingled my senses. Like I said, this movie is not for everyone. Some people are traditionalists and they might not like the modernization of the movie. On the other hand, this movie opens up the world of Shakespear to a crowd that would not have paid attention otherwise. I personally think that the movie was done beautifully. I think that maybe I would look at it more as I would at a painting than a movie. But it depends what you like. This movie is graphic and violent. Maybe a bit overly violent. I like that. Others might not. Make sure that you know what you are getting before watching this movie.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think it's one of the best cd's I bought and heard this year.All the songs have great lyrics and the beats rock.If you don't have it,you're missing out.
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow, what can I say? Evanescence and Fallen are just unbelievable.  I never liked rock music, never like the goth look, and never liked to buy CD's, until I heard Bring Me to Life.   <br /> <br />Amy's voice simply blows me away.  Other female singers usually rely on their angel's face, devil's body sort of thing, while Amy has the angelic voice and devil's face ^^ <br /> <br />As for each of the songs, I rate them as follows: <br /> <br />1. Going Under - 10/10 <br /> <br />The more I hear it, the more I like it. <br /> <br />2. Bring Me to Life - 10/10 <br /> <br />Yeah, sure it is played a lot.  But you can't deny it's a great song!!! <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool - 7/10 <br /> <br />Lots of sarcasm in this song.  Not bad. <br /> <br />4. My immortal - 11/10 <br /> <br />One of the best songs in the album.  She sings this song sooooo beautifully. <br /> <br />5. Haunted - 7/10 <br /> <br />Great to play at a Halloween party...lol Just kidding.  It's a pretty good song. <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet - 8/10 <br /> <br />A song about suicide...hmmm <br /> <br />7. Imaginery - 9/10 <br /> <br />I like the lyrics. <br /> <br />8. Taking over me - 11/10 <br /> <br />I like this song so very much.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's an awsome song!!! <br /> <br />9. Hello - 8/10 <br /> <br />Few but powerful words. <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath - 7/10 <br /> <br />Not bad.  But I wouldn't hear it over and over again like some of the other songs. <br /> <br />11. Whisper - 8/10 <br /> <br />I only like a portion of the song.   <br /> <br />I looks forward to their next album!!! <br />
0060005688|4.0|This was a good book, although definitely not for the advanced psychology student or professional. The ideas that Schwartz presents would be a great supplement to an introductory course in personality or social psychology, as it presents many of the key terms from those areas. Schwartz's main theory is that we, as a society, are presented with too many choices in our daily lives, and that more choice does not lead to a better quality of life. In fact, he argues that we should be satisfied with `good enough' and not seek to maximize our experiences all the time. The book was very general in nature and was easy to read and understand; the examples he used to illustrate his points were clear and easy to identify with as well. I didn't really learn anything new from the material presented here, but it was a great refresher on the subject and some of the main ideas of psychology in general.

1565114205|1.0|This Audio CD was alluring because it claimed experimental research in sales technique. I don't know about the book but DO NOT purchase the CD. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the narrator speaks in monotone. It is extremely difficult to be excited about the material when it is conveyed with such boredom.  <br /> <br />Secondly, there is a lot of uneccessary redundancy with how the material is presented. The first disc is wasted on exclaiming why this book is so good. This is very annoying. We already purchased the audio CD so get to the point!  <br /> <br />Finally, the most vexing issue of all is that the CD is not partitioned into tracks. Basically, disc one encompasses all chapters into one 60-min disc. Same with the others. This is a real pain since you can't merely reverse to the previous track to relisten to subjects. This is an extreme annoyance when you're holding back the seek button, and you have to hold it back for a while since the subjects are long and drawn-out, your finger slips and the track goes back to the beginning. Then you have to hold the seek button forward for a long time to get to where you want to. Imagine this while you're commuting to work! This may sound stupid to some but believe me, it is an absolute nuisance. The publishers took no consideration into its listeners when adapting the book to CD. <br /> <br />Basically, I want to save your time and money on this product. The audio CD needs much improvement to present the material in a clear and straight-forward manner. The publishers carelessly dumped the contents from the book on to however many CDs it took them. Poorly done. I am absolutely dissapointed with what could've been a descent product. Stay away from this Audio CD.  <br /> <br />

B000002GB4|3.0|The rock band 'Styx' are often lumped in with the progressive rock crowd, even if they don't fit the simplistic 'prog-fan' criteria for 'progness', i.e. long 20-minute songs. It's a label that has seen more criticism aimed at them than other 70's rock bands, mainly because of the higher expectation thrust upon them from that label, only to be disappointed that they aren't much more than a rock 'n' roll band.     And the band brought it on themselves; stick two short songs together with some talking and dubbing it a 'movemnt' on their first album, Dennis DeYoung's keyboards sounding a lot like that of Tony Banks, of Genesis fame, one of progressive rocks most formidable bands, among other reasons.     And when listening to this record, it is hard to imagine Styx as a proper prog band. But even if they aren't 'progressive' on paper, at least they are progressive 'In Spirit'.    Amongst ALL the 'prog' bands, Styx is one of the finest for creating atmosphere and aura. And never was that so on display as on this 1976 album titled 'Crystal Ball'. The songs are generally simple and the lyrics are about mundane subjects such as family, love and 'rocking out'. However, the songs are laced in eerie synths and haunting melodies, lending the album an unease throughout that tickles the subconscious with supernatural apparitions. For instance, consider the song 'Mademoiselle', a simple 70's glam-rock song about a high-class chick, but what about that third verse? All of a sudden there's this minor key riff and shrieking guitars that imply something sinister, even if there is nothing in the lyric to suggest it. This is the main element of the bands' music that perhaps adds appeal. Well, that and they know how to rock when they want to (Shooz), and lay the emotion on more passionately and with more gusto than about almost anyone (This old man).    Although this album is weighed down by some average songwriting, and lets face it, all those 'La la la's' and 'Whoa whoa's' at the end of last song are simply stretching the album out to a respectable time, (any shorter and it'd be hard a sell, what, being under 35 minutes as it is), it's energetic, charismatic and catchy, with the added bonus of the 'STYX' mystique. Rating ***1/2 (3.50 / 5.00)
B0002MB7QW|2.0|Years ago, I had the pleasure of seeing \\"Rent\\" on Broadway.  I thought the play was hilarious.  But while watching it I noticed something peculiar: I was laughing when no one else was.  Many times during the course of watching DAT I had a similar experience.  What made it so funny for me were the clich&eacute;s piled so high they practically snowed New York under all by themselves, and the general plot holes, PC speechifying, and all-around sloppy writing.<br /><br />The clich&eacute;s, oh lord the clich&eacute;s.  U2 actually made a very good song out of a nonstop string of clich&eacute;s (\\"With or Without You\\"); I guess the writers of DAT were attempting to do something similar here.  They failed.<br /><br /> Here are but a few of DAT's kitschy, classic clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The lines:<br /><br />* \\"Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight; the only one who hasn't taken a break.\\"<br />* \\"If we don't act now, it's going to be too late.\\"<br />* \\"Let's get you out of those wet clothes.\\"<br />* \\"I have to do this.\\" \\"I know.\\"<br />* \\"Sam might not have one more day.\\"<br />* \\"I made my son a promise. I'm going to keep it.\\"<br /><br />The scenes:<br /><br />* The boy with leukemia. The writers should've had the guts to just go ahead and name him \\"Timmy.\\"<br />* If you're an ethnic floor polisher, or an ethnic New York City bum, your chances of surviving a disaster are very good indeed. If it's a choice between you and a bunch of white yuppies, you are practically guaranteed to survive.<br />* The speech-to-the-roomful-of-important-military-and-civilian-personnel scene. The only thing missing was Peter Sellers in a wheelchair with a German accent.<br /><br />Now, some of these clich&eacute;s might not rise to the level of \\"Dammit Jim, I'm just a simple country doctor, not a miracle worker!\\" but they all at least come close. I think the only way the movie could have been more clich&eacute;d would be if Michael Bay had directed.<br /><br />The plot holes, the PC-ness, the lack of common sense:<br /><br />* How exactly does cold weather cause wolves to get smart enough to bust out of the Manhattan Zoo? Also, since when does the Manhattan Zoo have wolves? Sea lions -- yes. Penguins -- yes. Polar bears -- yes. Wolves -- no.<br />* Is it just me, or is Sela Ward a dead ringer for Michael Jackson?<br />* Again, how exactly does global warming cause a new ice age?<br />* Why did Jack come to rescue his son in the first place (and have one of his teammates die along the way, in yet another great clich&eacute;d scene -- the only thing missing was Quaid yelling \\"N-o-o-o-o-o!\\" in slow motion as his traveling companion fell to his death)? So he could be there when the rescue helicopters came?<br />* When he comes to rescue his son, why didn't Jack see the smoke from the burning books rising from the New York Public Library?<br />* Birds migrating south before the storm. Yeah, yeah, they're smarter than humans, I get it.<br />* Dick Chen -- er, Vice President Becker, giving a mea culpa, sorry-for-America-destroying-the-world-and-looking-down-on-Latin-America speech at the end of the flick. It sort of reminded me of the end to \\"The Jungle.\\"<br /><br />I encourage you to buy this movie cheap, or to rent it.  I can't exactly call it camp; the movie cost too much to make to call it that.  F/X saves it from total ignominy.  Anyhow, watch DAT for the laughs, and maybe keep track of the rip-offs from every other disaster movie ever made and all the logic errors and propaganda along the way.since when does the Manhattan Zoo have wolves?

B0002DB52M|1.0|I am not 100% certain where all the fascination with the most base and rank parts of human nature came from, but this movie spends three hours making certain that you get your fill. After chapter three, I was able to predict the entire movie with Nostradamus-like clairvoyance. The movie follows quite a simple pattern. In any given situation, select the most base and evil part of human nature, amplify it by a factor of 100, and then make it reality...  Over and over again...  And hey, while your at it why don't you sexually abuse the Grace character again. <br /> <br />The only redeeming quality of this film was the way it was produced. I did appreciate the unusual stark soundstage and how it very much reflected a play setting. This setting was used to its best effect the first time that Grace was raped. <br /> <br />Overall, however, the movie was long, uninteresting and poorly written.
0790731002|4.0|In reading other reviews of this rather silly romp, I'm amused at how many people take this Batman movie stuff so deadly serious, whining about which parts of the film seem unrealistic or less believable than other Batman movies, the comics, etc. <br /> <br />C'mon people.  We're talking about a guy with an average physique who, in costume, has the strength of ten men, can fly (or at least glide) and fall hundreds of feet safely, and can outdo a crowd of thugs with martial arts while wearing a thick rubber suit with a long cape.  We're also talking about a world where the bad guys never get caught, construct elaborate hiding places and instruments of evil without anyone noticing, and take on outrageous personae like Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Two-Face, Catwoman, etc.  Yeah, that's realistic. <br /> <br />In other words, this is FANTASY.  It must be viewed as such, and must be judged on that basis.  And with that in mind, \\"Batman Forever,\\" although definitely a left turn from the first two \\"Batman\\" films with Tim Burton & Michael Keaton, is a fun film that doesn't take itself seriously.  I think that's perfectly appropriate.  It certainly doesn't go too far over the edge into camp, although there are a couple of nods to the '60s TV series that still brings a smile to most of our faces in spite of the groans of the purists. <br /> <br />Val Kilmer, admittedly, is not much of a Batman, and the fourth film, \\"Batman and Robin,\\" found the series degenerating beyond repair, much like the fourth Superman film ruined that series.  However, both villains here are perfect, including Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, who is clearly having a blast hamming it up in the role of the over-the-top attorney gone psycho.  Nicole Kidman has some brilliant scenes, although the character is badly handled in general.  And Chris O'Donnell just fits as Robin, and the story of his family tragedy just works, as does his character's response to same.  Jim Carrey is obviously ideal both for the role ofthe Riddler and of his alter ego, Edward Nygma. <br /> <br />If you can take a chill pill as regards this film's relation to the comics, the first two films, and the TV series, I think you'll find it a really enjoyable part of the Batman mythos.  Those who take these things too seriously, well, go back to your \\"graphic novels\\" and let the rest of us have a little fun.
0395389496|5.0|\\"Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.\\" --The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburg<br /><br />The Polar Express, written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsberg, is a children's book where a magical train ride on Christmas Eve takes a boy to the North Pole to receive a special gift from Santa Claus. A winner of the Caldecott Medal, this book was released in 1985 and is the basis for the movie featuring Tom Hanks.<br /><br />The story begins with a little boy laying on his bed, straining to hear the ringing bells of Santa's sleigh. He relates that his friends insisted that there was no Santa, but he knew they were wrong. Instead of hearing ringing bells, though, the boy hears the hissing steam and squeaking metal of the Polar Express--a magical train filled with children that is bound for the North Pole.<br /><br />When the train arrives at the North Pole, the conductor tells the children that Santa will select one of them to receive the first gift of Christmas. The little boy happens to be the one that is chosen, and although he realizes that he could have any gift that he could imagine, he chooses one silver bell from Santa's sleigh.<br /><br />Although the silver bell made the most magical sound, like nothing the little boy or his sister has heard before, it becomes apparent that not everyone can hear it's beautiful ringing. In fact, when the boy rings it on Christmas morning, his parents thought it was broken because they don't hear a sound.<br /><br />The final paragraph in The Polar Express says:<br /><br />\\"At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.\\"<br /><br />I've been a fan of this book ever since I laid eyes on its enchanting illustrations over a decade ago. However, this book isn't just beautifully illustrated: it contains a magical tale that delights young and old alike (just ask my 6 year old son!)his book isn't just beautifully illustrated: it contains a magical tale that delights young and old alike (just ask my 6 year old son!) <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002I2M|3.0|The Doors swansong recording is as vastly over-rated as the band itself. Chief cuts \\"Love Her Madly\\", and \\"Riders on the Storm\\" were often featured on Casey Kasam's weekly Top 40 radio broadcast (where they belonged), and were often answers to his Name-That-Tune geussing game inwhere children could win a free game of bowling if they were the \\"Seventh caller\\". Needless to say, Mr. Kasam ran out of coupons quickly as every child in the world knew those songs by heart. Children from every industrialized nation; children from every walk of life, stood by thier phones and waited to hear the sound of rain or bells, knowing these sounds meant free bowling. More than a few children wrote \\" I Love Her Madly \\" and/or, \\" I'm a Rider on the Storm \\" with chalk sticks on city pavements. Whole classes geussed which one would play first. Third graders on up laughed at thier little friends for playing such a silly game. Like Tic-Tac-Toe.L.A. Woman is the most grandiose bit of self-promotion the rock world has ever seen: beady-eyed singer Jim Morrison, whose dad was the youngest Admiral in the Navy at the time, mixed up the letters of his own name to spell \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\", and shouted said anagram over and over again as if to proclaim the Second Coming of Christ. Small children laughed. The Clergy snickered. Had the other band members reigned in Morrison, and stuck with thier clear Pop & Roll prowess, I believe they'd still be much endeared, as Top 40 was thier strong suit. The Doors were not the revolutionary rockers Morrison demanded they be remembered as.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|When you discover the French musical \\"Notre Dame de Paris,\\" you'll get the feeing that you've stumbled upon a rare and wonderful gem that nobody else has been lucky enough to know about, but you. Thankfully, the video of this fabulous musical is readily available for anyone to see, but this doesn't make it any less of a gem! <br /> <br />The story is that of Victor Hugo's \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" and as people here have mentioned before, this musical sticks incredibly close to the storyline of the novel. Unlike Disney or many Broadway shows, \\"Notre Dame\\" doesn't try to gloss up Hugo's tragedy or cover up its many controversial themes with happy endings or peppy little dance numbers. <br /> <br />The setting is the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, and the time, pre-Renaissance. A poet named Gringoire is the storyteller as he opens and closes the musical with a song about the ancient cathedral and of the many conflicting new changes, inventions, and traditional values that seem to be causing unrest in Paris at the time. A band of wandering gypsies, led by Clopin, enter the gates of Paris in order to start a life in the city. Esmeralda, a young Spanish gypsy girl, catches the eye of Phoebus, a Parisian soldier, and is in turn attracted to him. Phoebus is engaged to a young firl named Fleur De Lys, and his heart becomes torn between the captivating foreigner Esmeralda, and his duty to Fleur De Lys and to the city. Meanwhile, inside the cathedral, both the priest Frollo and the deformed bellringer Quasimodo see Esmeralda, and fall in love with her. Frollo, unable to ever have Esmeralda as his own, becomes consumed by jealousy. Events reach a climax as there is a murder... a framing... and an innocent thrown in jail. <br /> <br />The most wonderful aspect about this musical is that everything is told in song and dance, with hardly a speaking line. The music is very distinct, dominated by mostly acoustic guitar, traditional instruments, and easy Andalusian beats that give you a flavor of the time and place, without sounding outdated. There are few huge, overwhelming, sweeping musical numbers, which makes the music much more character-centered. And also, because music and song dominate the entire 2 + hours instead of only having only five or six standout tracks to listen to repeatedly, none of the music ever \\"gets old,\\" and you'll find that the tunes are just as fresh the thirtieth time around as the first. (Believe me on this one!) <br /> <br />The singing is amazing. My favorite singer is Bruno Pelletier (Gringoire) who has a clear, very powerful baritone. Another star is Garou (Quasimodo) whose surprising,emotional raspy growl is perfect for the role of the tortured Quasimodo. The two main women's voices are relatively softer than most Broadway musical actresses', but their softness fits perfectly in their roles as a kind gypsy, and a young innocent girl. <br /> <br />If you have even the slightest interest in musicals, please pick this one up. It might be on the expensive side, but believe me, the music, singing, and emotional storyline will stay inside your DVD player, and inside your memory for a long time to come.
B0002SROT0|4.0|From a basement on the hill is a dense and moody album for Smith making the lighter moments such as the career defining \\"A Fond Farewell\\" and the intimate \\"twilight\\" all the more affecting. The heavier songs such as the swirling \\"Coast to Coast\\" and \\"Shooting star\\" are pulled off just as beautifully. My favorite though is the haunting epic \\"King's crossing\\", which sounds like it should have been the last track on the album. I was hoping this album would suck as it might have made his departure easier to accept.

1592400876|4.0|This \\"zero tolerance approach to punctuation\\" is a fun ride through the messups and missteps of others. Author Lynne Truss's basic premise is that punctuation matters. Rather than compiling hard and fast rules, she provides examples of where wrong (or no) punctuation causes confusion. And she's up-to-date in taking on email conventions like the excessive use of emoticons, dashes, and ellipses.<br /><br />This is probably of most use to people who already care about commas and colons, who enjoying seeing their pet peeves peeve others as well. People really trying to master grammar and punctuation might feel a little underserved.<br /><br />My favorite anecdote is Truss's description of a woman at a book signing who complained that she always wished she new how to punctuate and that someone would write a book that would show her how. I think we've all met this woman in one sphere of our lives or another. The willfully lost person who refuses to look at the map before them. Surely, she fits some Jungian archetype. Truss's book may not provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject, but she certainly goes out of her way to make the subject interesting even to the woefully ignorant.<br /><br />PS, The title is explained on the back cover.
0452282152|4.0|I really enjoy these types of novels about an actual person or historical event and what may have occurred surrounding him or it.  This particular novel is about an actual painter (Vermeer) and an actual painting (Girl with a Pearl Earring).  The artist creates a beautiful fantasy about who the girl in the painting might have been and what her relationship to Vermeer might have been.<br /><br />It is beautifully written and I fully enjoyed it.  Highly recommended.
B00000IL1K|5.0|After several good but not outstanding pop albums, Sarah Brightman hit her stride in the expansive, sensuous \\"Eden,\\" a lush collection of ethereal songs that seem almost otherworldly. Brightman's beautiful voice and excellent choice of songs make this a near-perfect pop album, as deep and rich as fine velvet.<br /><br />It opens with synth waves and jungle sounds in \\"In Paradisum,\\" followed by a dramatic male choir in a warm, lush cover of Hooverphonic's \\"Eden.\\" A slightly more acoustic sound enters with the gentle \\"So Many Things\\" and guitar-led \\"Dust in the Wind.\\" Then she swerves into more operatic territory with the stirring \\"Il Mio Cuore Va\\" (an Italian cover of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\").<br /><br />The album peaks with the aching tenderness of \\"Only An Ocean Away,\\" a dramatic song about distance between lovers, and the stirring plea of \\"Deliver Me\\" with its chorus of rich voices repeating the title line. Then Brightman ends on a high note (no pun intended) with the musically spare, gauzy love ballad \\"The Last Words You Said.\\"<br /><br />Very few albums like \\"Eden\\" are made -- it draws its listeners in through intrigue and beauty rather than any obvious ploys for attention. It's hard to imagine just how it could be better than it is -- a few tweaks here and there, but no song feels out of place or superfluous. Whether she's reworking covers or dipping into Puccini, the music sounds flawless and uniform.<br /><br />Brightman's vocals are usually high and sweet here, lending a fragile edge to the majestic music. In songs like \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga,\\" she gets to show a bit more of her range, with her voice becoming richly operatic. And she gets to really soar when she sings deeply emotional songs, belting out \\"There's an ocean between us/you know where to find me... more than a lifetime/still goes on forever/but it helps to remember/you're only an ocean away...\\"<br /><br />The musical arrangements that accompany her are nothing short of epic -- orchestral strings that serve as a backdrop for her voice, solid drums, and even some pleasant acoustic guitar here and there. Even a few sound samples like thunder and jungles. Harkening back to her \\"Fly\\" and \\"Dive\\" days, Brightman also uses bits and pieces of electronica, adding texture to the sweeping string arrangements.<br /><br />Sarah Brightman found her niche in the magnificent \\"Eden,\\" a richly sensuous album full of romance, sorrow and unrestrained beauty. Definitely a must-have for fans of beautiful music.rings that serve as a backdrop for her voice, solid drums, and even some pleasant acoustic guitar here and there.

B000002V0Q|5.0|RUST IN PEACE is Megadeth's best album. There was no way that Dave Mustaine and Co. could outdo the metal perfection of that album by producing another one like it. So rather than try to copy what they did, Megadeth changed the tone, the style, and created something all new, and all great. <br /> <br />COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION is more catchy and a bit more mainstream than previous Deth albums, with a more streamlined structure to songs, and with a bit more emphasis on the lyrics now that Mustaine is actually able to sing properly. This change in style is unsettling at first, but by the end of SKIN O MY TEETH, you will be hooked and dragged in. <br /> <br />The writing is much improved also, with SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION and SWEATING BULLETS the standouts in that respect, while the injection of a few thoughtful ballads (FORECLOSURE OF A DREAM and the title track) showcase the musical talent on offer and set a precedent for all the band's following albums(culminating disappointedly in RISK, before the band went back to it's roots).  <br /> <br />But, as always with Megadeth it is the sound that dominates, and, while more acessible than RUST, is every bit as aggressive and enjoyable(PSYCHOTRON is the best song about a robot since the theme to \\"Gigantor\\" TV series). the guitars are chunkier, the base is punchier and the drums are earpounding. Some may say that Mustaine is trying for a Metallica kind of sound (SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION especially) but since he was a founding member of the band, I don't think he left his influences behind when he left them, and he proves here that Megadeth are every bit as good as (and in some places better than) Metallica and deserve to be rated seperately from them in every way. And, in that respect, i give you COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION, a monster metal album and a monster album Period...Playa!

B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes fellow Star Wars fans it is true they made some changes to the movies from the original releases, however its very worth owning. The changes that Lucas made did not change the most important thing about the movies, THE STORY ! The special effects are phenomenal , but the story is Golden. This epic tale of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil is simply poetic as placed against a back drop of Light sabers and Alien worlds. The color and sound on every film is flawless , and the changes were seamless and did not interrupt the enjoyment of the film in any way. The commentaries are fantastic and insightful. The fourth disc is packed with great extras even the art work in each DVD is great.  <br />I do ask this to all of you who are angry with the changes. If you had the power to go back and change something in your life and make it better , wouldn't you?
B0002TT0NM|5.0|I personaly found that both the film and the book were very good.  All of the Harry Potter books and films have been very enjoyable.
0767816641|5.0|A really exquisite movie that will make you laugh, cry, and keep putting it on again for more<br /><br />The movie is about a girls school in Paris and the adventures of 12 adorable little girls, with the cutest and most interesting of all being the plucky flame haired little tyke, with a heart of gold Madeline (Hatty Jones).<br /><br />With adventures taken from the timeless books, including little Madeleine's appendicitis, and her rescue from the water by the golden retriever Genevieve, the centerpiece of the story is the battle of the girls and their loving guardian Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) to keep their school and their dog, against the cruel plans of Lord Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and also foiling a thuggish tutor cum kidnapper Leopold (Ben Daniels)<br /><br />This is really beautiful, not only for kids, but for all young at heart aged  2 to 122 years of age.<br /><br />There are just so many wonderful memorable heart-stealing scenes, funny cute and poignant.
B0000C7PRY|4.0|Neal Morse is the former lead singer and main songwriter for Spock's Beard (regarded by many as one of the best progressive rock bands of the past decade), and also for the progressive rock supergroup Transatlantic.  In late 2002, Neal announced that he was leaving both bands because he felt that God was calling him to do something different with his life.  Like many fans of Spock's Beard and Transatlantic, I was both shocked and saddened to hear this news.  However, I respected Neal's conviction to follow his conscience, and I hoped that at some point he would do a progressive rock project again.  It turns out that I didn't have to wait long.  Less than a year after leaving Spock's Beard, Neal released Testimony, a progressive rock epic, complete with Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater, Transatlantic) on drums.    Musically, Testimony sounds (not surprisingly) quite a bit like Spock's Beard, but a bit less progressive and a bit more pop-influenced.  The second disc in particular is less progressive (with some notable exceptions, such as \\"The Storm Before the Calm\\"); in fact, some of the songs on disc two appear to be very much influenced by contemporary Christian music.  Another thing to note about the music is that Neal uses several musical themes which recur throughout the album.  These recurring themes are a neat idea in one way, but at times they seem to make the album drag on longer than necessary, by recycling things we have heard several times already.     The vocal and instrumental performances on Testimony are great, especially Mike Portnoy's excellent drumming.  However, the album probably would have sounded better if Neal had brought in some outside help with the guitar and bass parts.  Neal does a great job playing these instruments (in addition to keyboards) himself, but it's a case of too much of one musician, resulting in a somewhat \\"inbred\\" sound.  I would have preferred to hear Neal stick to playing the keyboards, and bring in a bass player and a guitarist of the same caliber as Mike Portnoy.  (OK, actually that's a pretty tall order, considering Portnoy's immense talent  -- so let's just say a very good bass player and guitarist.)    But the real story of Testimony is the lyrics.  Neal takes a very different lyrical direction on this album as compared to most of his past projects, by telling a story that is both deeply personal and deeply religious.  In Testimony, Neal tells the story of his life, starting with his days trying to make it as a singer/songwriter in L.A., through some very dark times when it seemed that everything was going wrong, to his eventual conversion to Christianity.  The album then ends with a few worship-oriented songs, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.  As a Christian myself (though one who is not a fan of most contemporary Christian music), I am not at all bothered by the lyrics -- in fact I find some of them quite inspiring.  But I can definitely see how some non-Christian fans of Neal's previous work could be turned off by the lyrics in some of the songs.    In summary, Testimony is not quite as good as Neal's work with Spock's Beard and Transatlantic (in my opinion), but it is a very good album nonetheless.  And I admire Neal's courage in making this album, considering the very personal nature of the lyrics, and considering that a significant number of his previous fans will likely be turned off by the religious direction that his music has taken.
B00005JLEX|5.0|OK, the guy who thinks Seinfeld sucks? Not a very credible source. Examine his other reviews. He (yes, HE) gave Angel and The Gilmore Girls outstanding ratings.  <br /> <br />Adios, credibility (and your Guy Card needs to be revoked)
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had no idea who Gavin DeGraw was until 2 months ago when a friend bought me the cd. Ever since then, I listen to it probably 2 times a day - his voice is like no other and his songs will not get out of your head. Last night I just saw him in concert in St. Petersburg..can we say amazing?  Not only did he sing songs from his album but he sang Lets Get It On and was so amazing at it. Hearing his voice and watching him sing makes me melt.  Want a new obsession? ..Buy Gavin DeGraw's cd. I promise, you will LOVE it (and thats an understatement)
B00005JNEI|1.0|Most people know Michael Moore, the documentary film maker with a great sense of humor who approaches his subjects on a very original manner.<br /><br />Everybody remembers how he was boo-ed when he called against the war in Iraq at some superstar gala.<br /><br />Everybody was anticipating Fahrenheit 9/11 with the highest expectations.<br /><br />And a lot of people were very disappointed.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11 isn't really about 9/11. It's about George Bush and how the Democratic party is going to save America from that Christian Texas cowboy.<br /><br />Not a word about government involvement in September 11. Moore simple continues the myth that Muslim terrorist thought this all out from their caves in Afghanistan because \\"they hate our freedom\\".<br /><br />Not a word about the fact that George Bush, just as Michael Moore's Savior John Kerry, is a member of the satanic and fascistic Skull and Bones cult.<br /><br />No, this is not the kind of movie that you put on to educate yourself or others. It is a school example of how the establishment tries to spin their version of events with an alternative image.<br /><br />But sure, you can watch it and see a great portrait of George W. Bush, including many of his famous quotes such as \\"Saddam tried to kill my dad\\" and all that.<br /><br />And then look at some real movies about 9/11 and the new world order: \\"911, the biggest lie ever sold\\", for example. Or \\"911: The Road To tyranny\\", which can even be downloaded for free from the Internet!
B00005JNEI|2.0|I suppose the reason SNL and Jay Leno are funnier in their spoofs on politics is because they are intentionally funny. The humor in this, and others such as \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" are funny only in the serious play on the ironic -- remember the bank giving away free guns with a new account? But in this the issue is not guns, but the use of serious irony in interpreting political action. The target audience, those that like it, I think need no persuasion. They cheer the movie because it presents their point of view. Perhaps little else in movies does. Those that do not share the point of view react with horror. Isn't this a Straw Man argument? Putting supposed thoughts in someone's head while they sit in a class room is not science or fact especially when the information given suggests guilt by association. Who else did business with the Bin Ladens? IBM? How much gas have you used in your car? So who are the merely foolish for watching this? Those that watch this for the entertainment value are not entertained since it pretends to be too serious. They may only get angry. Those that watch for narrative re-enforcement and think narrative interpretation is fact are the ones I think most foolish and most attracted to it. And after elections we see how divisive this narrative re-enforcement can be. If only the ridiculous attracts serious dialogue will be hard to find.

B00002E224|5.0|Hey, if you're one those kinds of viewers who's into the usual Hollywood romantic drama/comedy, steer clear of this one. Because this is a giant talk-fest and doesn't have syrupy and digusting melodrama that many Romance movies contain. If you're actually a smart viewer who knows a good Romance when they see one, check it out! Richard Linklater does't normally rely on plot with many of films. He focuses on the dialogue and emotions of the characters.     Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is an American journalist who's just spending on a vacation with plans on visiting Madrid for personal reasons.  Celine (Julie Delpy) is a young French girl with a heart of gold. She's on her way to Paris and Jesse has a flight home tomorrow morning. After an awkward encounter on a train, they conversate until the train makes a stop. Jesse persuades Celine to get off with him that way they can get to know eachother and stroll all around the many different areas of Vienna.  They fall deeply for eachother and it never sinks into the Hollywood Romance cliches where within the next few scenes after the encounter, they decide to find a hotel and sleep with  ( I would put down a slang word for \\"sex\\" but I can't) eachother until they die. But that never happens. In a way, it's a bit sad considering they only have about 12 hours since they both have to leave the next day and may never see eachother again. It would be absolutely painful. You would understand if you ever fell for somebody for a short while and realize that somebody is forced to leave and they're long gone outta your life. Linklater has a very creative ear for dialogue. It seem so believable and Hawke and Delpy really nail the lines down. Jesse and Celine only have hours left. Will they ever reunite sooner or later? Will they end up moving on and forgetting eachtother?    Does \\"Before Sunrise\\" have a plot? Well, not really, but there really is no need for one and it's pretty much Linklater's trademark. The dialogue and chemistry between Hawke and Delpy save it. Like I said before, if you're into the usual mainstream romantic films, just stay away! It's gonna bore you to tears. But for those who think differently and want an intelligent one, it's definitely worth checking out and maybe one of Linklater's best films.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Robert McNamara is soft-spoken, sensitive, intelligent -- not an evil man, at least in conventional terms. He doesn't speak harshly, scowl or drip fire from his eyes. It is his central place in pursuing ravaging wars that makes him a villian in this eyes of man, and a patriot in the eyes of some. Hearing \\"Mac\\" describe himself is what makes this film so interesting.<br /><br />The worst you could probably say about McNamara is that there is a serious disconnect between his calculated policies and the suffering, terror and death that resulted from them. McNamara is aware, at least intellectually, that his decisions caused suffering; that awareness is just another data point in his life, and doesn't seem to stop him or bother him all that much. At some level, every war counselor must dissociate himself from human suffering, otherwise military operations would be impossible to carry out. Ulysses S. Grant was not called \\"The Butcher\\" because he was unwilling to send wave after wave of Union troops into the maws of death at Vicksburg. At some point, however, you hope that those who take on this awesome burden will be humbled and transformed. McNamara, for all the death and destruction attributed to him -- from Hiroshima to Vietnam -- seems almost completely unaffected by the enormity of his historical role.<br /><br />McNamara's recall is extraordinary, as is his ability to carefully categorize and logically lay out his experiences. But he is altogether a hollow (if not soulless) man, seemingly deaf to pain. Though he sees how others could regard him as a war criminal (based on his work against Japan during WWII), the charge (and its possible truth) doesn't affect him emotionally. It just seems to be another quantitative fact of life, like the weather or the result of a vote. He often seems wistful, but never sad or horrified.<br /><br />\\"The Fog of War\\" is a lesson about the kind of person used by government to prosecute wars. He doesn't necessarily have to be a warmonger or have deep-seated psychological scars. He can simply be the kind of human calculator with no more visceral attachment to feeding humans into the machinery of death than of feeding cars down an assembly line. Significantly, McNamara did both jobs. One can only wish that he stuck with the machines and left war to those with a deeper capacity for emotion.armonger or have deep-seated psychological scars. He can simply be the kind of human calculator with no more visceral attachment to feeding humans into the machinery of death than of feeding cars down an assembly line.

B00005Y6YB|4.0|I've read a lot of confusing reviews about Lonesome Dove on DVD. It's my favourite book and I've got a pretty well used copy of the mini series I video-taped when it aired on TV. I want to purchase the DVD but before doing so would like feedback on whether the DVD (containing 2 discs) is a true transfer from the original VHS version. Could someone categorically verify this for me. Thanks.
0312995423|1.0|OK, so i know it's fiction... but it's not supposed to be fantasy.  Digital Fortress does not contain \\"inaccuracies\\"... it's a fairy tale about computers, email and encryption.  In the first 90 pages... i couldn't find anything to convince me that Dan Brown had the technical expertise to use a word processor. <br /> <br />I have thoroughly enjoyed The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons... and couldn't understand how so many people were offended by what i thought to be a differing opinion on the history of modern catholicism... but if the historical events described in them are as contrived as the crap in Digital Fortress, I can understand the frustration.  It makes me think that his ideas aren't pulled from obscure religious references... but rather from his imagination.  While I'm not saying there is anything wrong with this, it does make the story feel less relevant and less interesting. <br />  <br />I tried to have an open mind and just gloss over the absurdity... email is secure... magical supercomputer... secret agency... but when the technician had to \\"reboot the screen\\" to make sure what he was seeing was right... i had to \\"put down the book\\" because what i was reading was wrong.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a huge sci-fi fan (books, tv, movies), but I did not watch the series while it was on the air, which I regret.  I started renting the DVDs and now I am purchasing the series to watch them over again.  This is an amazing show and you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it.  If you are looking for intriguing and sympathetic characters (both the good and the bad guys), tightly written action/adventure stories that draw you in, and wonderfully witty dialogue, then this is it.  Watch at least 2 episodes and you'll get it. <br /> <br />PS I have to say I am bitter it has been cancelled and I hope that it will get another chance as a series, hopefully, with a network that will support it and help realize its potential.
B000001EG6|5.0|Back when Rocket re-issued Elton's catalog, I skipped this disc and \\"11-17-70\\" for the same reason, these were early albums and not up to par with say \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" or \\"Don't Shoot Me...\\" how wrong I was! \\"Elton John\\" is just as good, if not BETTER than \\"Brick Road\\". The songs are much more quiet than his later hits, and there seems to be this underlying sadness in them that is just so hard to describe, you have to hear them. Paul Buckmaster's orchestration nail that sadness home. The lyrics may not be up to par with \\"Candle In The Wind\\" or other later songs, but Elton was able to take Bernie's lyrics and turn them into early masterpieces. For me the best tracks are \\"First Episode At Hienton\\", \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"The Cage\\", \\"The King Must Die\\" and of course \\"Your Song\\" but the whole album is just so ethereal. If you've avoided this album for so long like me, give it a spin, it may have come out 34 years ago, but it's a lot better than most of the \\"music\\" you hear these days!!
B000068IEU|4.0|Wes Craven's first film \\"LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT\\" is one of the very first reality horror films! It is also one of the very best reality horror movies!

B00063MBU8|5.0|Ok Well This cd is awesome. All The lyrics are amazing And have good points to them. I think \\"shut up\\" is good, because oddly enough the first time I heard it, it reminded me of my mom. I first heard of simple plan up in Canada. I went to go see a small show of them a few years ago and it was amazing. I love Their sound. Their new cd is even better then the first, which isnt usually the case with bands. in \\"crazy\\" I think it explains how this world is. I believe it goes out to a lot of their \\"fans\\" Because some are fake and \\"Love\\" them but only know the songs on the radio. The cds amazing And I havent stopped listening to it since the day it came out!!!!
B000002OOY|5.0|Jurassic Park combined intense action with a sense of wonder and awe that changed filmaking.  John Williams perfectly captured this duality with a terrific score.  This main themes are totally different but flow perfectly into one another.  One theme is loud and bombastic as well as memorable while the other is quiet and understated but still great.  A highly enjoyable score by a master composer.
006052779X|5.0|E.B. White's tender classic remains a favorite for those of us who grew up in the fifties-for friendship and self-sacrifice are timeless virtues.  Eight-year-old Fern Arable begs her father to spare the life of the runt of a litter of pigs, whom she lovingly names Wilbur and treats as a baby.  Finally being sold to relatives on another farm, Wilbur has an easy time at first in the lower section of the Zuckerman's barn, but he gradually decides that his life is still empty, for he needs a special true friend.  He fears he will die of heartbreak over his loneliness-not realizing that his destiny as a pig is to be fattened for a Christmas butchering. <br /> <br />      This delightful tale chronicles the special friendship which is extended to him by a talented gray spider named Charlotte, who undertakes as her personal mission to save the life of the gentle young pig.  Obviously she has to deceive the Zuckermans into believing that their pig is too remarkable to kill.  Because she is such an excellent writer, she uses her web to advertise Wilbur's best features-which is considered a miracle.  Meanwhile Fern sits quietly in the barn and listens to all the animals' conversation, though she does not participate.  Naturally her mother is worried about this tendency to prefer animals to her peers.  Revealing many human characteristics, the animals work together (or not), boys will be boys, until the final farewell.  Wilbur is not the only one to shed tears at the spider's brief life cycle, but hope is renewed each spring.  This is a wonderful read-aloud story, for children of all ages. <br /> <br />
0385504209|3.0|But waaaaay too long!<br /><br />I'm not going to say that I didn't somewhat enjoy this book, or that I was not caught up in its mystery (I refrain from describing the plot here, as myriad reviewers have done it as well, or better than, I could do). It's just that I had some problems:<br /><br />The main characters were completely wooden. The clues to the mystery went from truly interesting and engaging to tiresome to boring to parody (I found myself laughing by the last half of the book). The entire premise, while fun to read, was ridiculous. And so on.<br /><br />As a friend of mine has said, this book would make a great movie, and I agree. We are having fun \\"casting\\" the main characters, but they are so one-dimensional, it's hard to do so. I'm glad I read the book, I give it a C-plus, but I think it could have ended, and ended well, a good 100 pages before it did. As for the religious premise: I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. At first I took it somewhat seriously, but by the end, I was literally laughing aloud.<br /><br />My take: fun, frivolous and mediocre.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks for years now, and The Notebook was the first book of his that I read. I fell in love with it and have been excited to see this movie ever since I heard that it was being filmed. I went to see it the other night with high expectations; I had seen A Walk To Remember (another of one of Sparks' books turned movie) and expected The Notebook to be just as wonderful. I was not wrong; the film was most excellent. HOWEVER, I was extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with how much they changed from the book. <br /> <br />In the movie, Alli's last name is Hamilton. In the book, it's Nelson. <br />In the movie, the story takes place in Seacrest, South Carolina. In the book, it takes place in New Bern, North Carolina. <br />In the movie, Alli is reluctant to date Noah at first. In the book, she is taken by him immediately. <br />In the movie, Alli and Noah do not lose their virginities to each other. In the book, they do. <br />In the movie, it is 1940ish when Alli and Noah first meet. In the book, it is 1932. <br />In the movie, Alli and Noah fight constantly and Alli is rather violent. In the book, none of that ever happens. <br />In the movie, Gus is never mentioned. In the book, he is one of Noah's best friends. <br />In the movie, Alli meets Lon when he come in injured at the hospital she volunteers at. In the book, they meet at a Christmas party. <br />In the movie, Noah writes to Alli every day for a year. In the book, he writes to her for over two years. <br />In the movie, Noah receives the money to buy the old plantation house with his war bonds and money his father receives from selling their house. In the book, Noah gets his money from his old boss named Morris Goldman. <br />In the movie, Martha Shaw is the woman Noah sleeps with. In the book, she is simply a neighbor--it was a different woman he slept with that went unnamed. <br />In the movie, Noah and Alli are 17 and both are graduated from high school. In the book, Noah is 17 and graduated but Alli is only 15.  <br />In the movie, Alli's mother went through a similar experience with a lumberyard boy. In the book, she didn't. <br />In the movie, Noah and Alli have 2 daughters and a son. In the book, they also have 2 daughters and a son..but their son dies at the age of 4. <br />In the movie, Noah tries to stop Alli from leaving. In the book, he practically lets her go. <br />In the movie, it is never mentioned if Alli continues to paint. In the book, she becomes a famous painter.  <br />In the movie, Noah and Alli die at the end. In the book, they do not die--but instead they make love. <br /> <br />There are many more things I could point out, but I've only seen the movie once..and I'm sure you all get my point by now. <br /> <br />The movie was wonderful, but there was no point for Hollywood to twist and change an already lovely story. I suggest that if you want a beautiful and timeless love story, that you read the book instead.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I think I have a new favorite Christmas CD!  This newly-recorded collection of seasonal songs by Jethro Tull is a real delight from beginning to end.  The production is crystal-clear, and Ian Anderson and the boys sound as sprightly as ever.  Some of these tunes will be familiar to Tull fans:  \\"A Christmas Song\\", \\"Bouree\\" and \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" get new interpretations which are well-done, though I think I prefer the jauntier original version of \\"Solstice Bells\\".  The flute, vocals and arrangements throughout this recording are excellent, and indicative of vintage Tull, that trademarked expert melding of folk-rock, classical and jazz.  Other highlights are the instrumental medley \\"Holly Herald\\", \\"Another Christmas Song\\", and the traditional-style \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow\\".  But it's really hard to pick out the best tracks here, as they are all excellent.  If you're a Jethro Tull fan, this is a must-have.  But even if you're not, give it a try - it's a tasty wassail for the holiday season.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This movie is execlent. With all of hack and slash beat the crap of your opponent that telvision gives you, this is the one of the biggest breaths of fresh air I've recieved in a long time.  <br /> <br />The first time I saw the movie, I asked myself, \\"WHAT THE HECK!!!!\\". But I gave it time, and I started thinking about it (for those of you who may know me, making me think is no easy task). I love this movie like I love the ability to pogo.  <br /> <br />Note: While watching this movie, save all of your questions till the end of the ride, at that point you can have a field day.
0385336810|4.0|Can you Keep a Secret was a quick, fun read.  With a similar formula of the Shopacholic series, Sophie Kinsella comes up with a new character who steals our hearts from page 1!<br /><br />Emma Corrigan is an average girl, 20-something who's trying to find her path in life.  I think she's someone most of us can relate to with job woes, boyfriend woes, family issues etc.  The best part of Emma is that she's honest, and funny.  The things she says, the things she does and the way she thinks has you almost laughing outloud!  The whole story you're hoping, waiting for something to go right for her, and for her to get her happy ending.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story of Emma.  Nearly as much as our beloved Shopaholic Queen.  I think Kinsella managed to create another winning character and I wouldn't mind a sequel to this at all!  For a quick read over the weekend, a pick-me-up or something to read in between those more heavy novels- Sophie Kinsella's books do the trick!
B00014TJ6Q|3.0|George Harrison's 1976 album \\"Thirty-Three & 1/3\\" was a huge change from its predecessor, 1975's \\"Extra Texture\\", despite less than a year &  gap between the two albums. On the contrary, this self-titled 1979 follow up to \\"Thirty-Three & 1/3\\", despite the 2+ year gap between albums, has a very similar feel to the one that preceeded it. This album is pleasant, & the sound is often appealingly lush (though at times overproduced), but, like the last album, it's frustratingly slight. To put it a certain way, this album is like white bread--it's good & certainly not worthless, but it dramatically lacks both excitement and emotional impact. It`s also high in the sap department--George admitted in his book \\"I Me Mine\\", which originally came out in 1980, that he had been suffering from writer`s block for a lengthy period of time in the late `70s, & with this album, it really sounds like it. The fact that he does a re-recording of the 1968 \\"White Album\\" outtake \\"Not Guilty\\" does nothing to suggest writer`s block hadn`t sunk in. \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" has a splendid melody that puts the lyrics over, making it a highly enjoyable feel-good tune--it gets the album off to a strong start, although the last 45 seconds or so of the song do drag--it's as if George was just stretching the tune out for the mere sake of making it longer (the version of the song on the \\"Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989\\" compilation avoids this problem by fading out much earlier). \\"Blow Away\\" has lovely, sighing slide guitar work, and it's nice, as is \\"Soft Touch\\", though they're both rather underdeveloped & brought down by their sappiness. \\"Not Guilty\\" has a nice, ringing acoustic guitar line, but overall this jazzy soft rock tune is fluff & sounds a bit tossed off. \\"Faster\\" has a seemingly never-ending intro consisting of a race car sound before the actual tune finally starts, & it ends up not really being worth the wait--it's a ho-hum attempt at an inspirational song with some really weak lyrics & orchestration that doesn't help any. \\"If You Believe\\" is another limp attempt at an uplifting, inspirational number. \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" is an attempt at writing something Spanish-sounding, & it sounds like something you're likely to hear on the Weather Channel, & it's musically & lyrically half-baked, and sappy. \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" has nice ringing guitars, but, once again, the sappy lyrics bring it down, plus the slide guitar solo sounds startlingly & displeasingly clumsy as if George was having an off day & was too lazy to do another take. \\"Here Comes the Moon\\", in similar fashion to \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", is in 4/4 time & switches to 3/4 for a nice ringing, arpeggiated guitar line that unfortunately gets beaten into the ground, plus the verse melody is slight beyond all belief, the bridge portion is painfully \\"cosmic\\", & the lame chorus gets repeated way too many times. There is a very annoying tune on here, & as with \\"This Song\\" from the previous album, it happens to be the 4th track on the album (I told you these albums have a lot in common!)--it's the jokey, Leon Redbone-style \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\", made additionally annoying by the intentional speed/ pitch fluctuations on the fade. In the end, \\"George Harrison\\" is a heck of a disappointing listen indeed. For all its faults, the album is overall quite pleasant--it's rarely ever bad enough that you'll be compelled to reach for the stop or fast-forward buttons, but the way good musical ideas get buried & the overall slightness make for an album that leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br />Collectors are also bound to be disappointed with the bonus tracks, or lack thereof, on these reissues of his Dark Horse-era albums.  The inclusion of the 1980 track \\"Tears of the World\\" which was originally intended for the \\"Somewhere In England\\" album, yet got included as a bonus track on \\"Thirty-Three & 1/3\\", suggests a tossed off carelessness.  Perhaps a CD of rarities/ stray tracks is in the works, because George does have a lot of these.  The lone bonus track here is a total cheap shot--it's a completely needless demo version of \\"Here Comes the Moon\\".  A logical bonus track for this CD would have been the song \\"Mo\\", which was recorded in 1978, & was originally intended for this album--it was written for Mo Ostin who was the president of Warner Bros. Records at the time, & it's a nice tune despite the laughably hokey lyrics.
0192804782|4.0|Austen's S&S follows the same line of experience that all of her other books seem to follow, down to the family of sisters and the problems of proper behavior and good connections.  But like a truly masterful artist, she can write, essentially, the same story over and over again and still have it be exciting and interesting for all readers.  This is a book that can be appreciated by anyone over the 6th grade, and possibly younger.  It is a classic that should be a part of any avid reader's repetoire.
B00063MBU8|5.0|If you haven't bought the new Simple Plan album, 'Still Not Getting Any...', yet... what are you waiting for?  The energy this record has is insane. It will give you that tingling feeling down your spine like you get at live shows. The first single, \\"Welcome to my Life\\", is so darn infectious you'll never get it out of your head... but you won't care because it's that good. As are the rest of the songs on the album. It's very rare that I like every song on an album, but I do with this one. I liked it so much that I bought my friend a copy. So... what are you waiting for... stop reading this and go buy it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This takes an episode or two to hook you (the clash between the western and sci fi), but it's good.  One wonders why they cancelled it.  <br /> <br />I usually don't watch the special features stuff but in this case I did.   There are some scenes which didn't make it to air and one can see why.   The production info was interesting though, Whedon is a bit reminiscent of Peter Jackson. <br /> <br />Overall: decent production values, sets, and scripts, good acting, plus occassionally snappy dialogue (think Buffy).  The characters are engaging and likeable and that makes a difference.   <br /> <br />There is a bit of soft core sex but it's no worse than what's already on TV. <br /> <br />The real telltale is the statistics on the Amazon review page - over a thousand reviews and the rating is 5 stars. I will bet there are not many videos that achieve this. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|this cd is kick @$$.  i love it.  its so good.  i recommend everyone out there to go out and buy this cd.  it is so freaking awesome.  i listen to it non-stop in my car.  simple plan are like gods to me.  everyone in this world should get this cd and their first one.  go buy it now!!!!
B000002LPH|3.0|George Harrison's 1976 album \\"Thirty-Three & 1/3\\" was a huge change from its predecessor, 1975's \\"Extra Texture\\", despite less than a year &  gap between the two albums. On the contrary, this self-titled 1979 follow up to \\"Thirty-Three & 1/3\\", despite the 2+ year gap between albums, has a very similar feel to the one that preceeded it. This album is pleasant, & the sound is often appealingly lush (though at times overproduced), but, like the last album, it's frustratingly slight.

B0002KVUKM|3.0|Kate Beckinsale is in this and she hardly fits her angel wings, but she is somewhat less scary than in PEARL HARBOR when she wore clever underwear, or in BROKEDOWN PALACE. She's not as good as in LAUREL CANYON. Oops, I don't mean LAUREL CANYON, I haven't seen that yet. Well, whatever, i can't remember the name of the movie i wa thinking of. Anyhow, VAN HELSING is a pretty good atmospheric piece and the Vampires look more real but i wanted to see more waterfalls in Transylvania. Anyhow the high number of flying things in this disoriented me compared to some Vampire filcks. Still less bloodsucking than you would expect from a movie trying to capture the true circumlutionary postputillious vampire spirit. Not too good for children. My niece went with me, I think she was disappointed because she had Kate Beckinsale mixed up with Kate Bosworth. But I told her not to give up on anybody like Kate Beckinsale, unlike my brother has done, becausse one can learn to breathe clean air at any age. This'll never be my favorite vampire movie. but I've passed two hours in much worse cimenatic torture. Recommended for a pensive day when your excitement receptivity is moderate to lagging.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|If I'm Good Charlotte, Sum 41, or Simple Plan right now, I'm retiring young. Why? Because Green Day's back and they've proved they're still the best at what they do. I reviewed the album (the 'without the book' edition) already, so read that if you want details. All I need to say about this one is, the 'limited edition' version is much, much better, because it comes with a combination lyric book/ St. Jimmy's diary. It's poignant, it's entertaining, it's just incredible. <br /> <br />I jumped off the Green Day bandwagon after years of fandom when Warning came out... well, two great live shows and an EPIC album later, I'm back on their side. I never should have doubted them, no matter how bad Warning was.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This is one of the most original films that I've seen since ....\\" Adaptation \\" , and  \\"Being John Malcovich \\". Oh wait...all of these films were screenwritten by Charlie Kaufman. I guess that explains it. Honestly , with all of the corny references aside...this movie offers a creative and innovative script , excellent direction , nice soundtrack , and great acting. And one of the most noticable and impressive things , about this film , is the performance , given by it's leading man , Jim Carrey ( playing against typecast ). It took me<br />atleast 10 minutes to stop waiting for Jim Carrey to break out into \\" Mask , Ace Ventura , Dumb and Dumber\\" mode. Therefore, after realizing that this guy, obviously, wasn't going to go there..I relaxed and allowed myself to stop watching for Jim Carrey. Then , this innovative story..started breathing a life and believability of it's own. There are also fine performances by the supporting cast , especially Kate Winslet , who contrasts Jim Carrey's charactor , perfectly.The dvd doesn't provide many extras...but most dvd's don't until the initial \\" fuss\\" is over. So , if you're into dvd's with loads of extras , you'll be waiting for about two years , on this one. Good sountrack , good acting , great direction , great script , and Jim Carrey , in a possible , Oscar-nominated performance, make this a film worth it's purchase price.<br /><br />( added footnote 6-10-05 )<br />Guess , I was wrong. This film didn't win any awards. However, Kate Winslet was nominated , for her performance. Still , this film is worth checking out. But since Jim Carrey ,and this film , premiered the same year as \\"Ray\\" ( which captured Jamie Fox in his, sizzling performance as Ray Charles ) , there was absolutely no chance of Carrey winning an academy for best actor.
6305736650|5.0|a sigh is just a sigh, as time goes by ...\\" is the song that summarizes this classic romantic film of the 1940s. The film has everything that makes a hit: a handsome leading man, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and a beautiful leading lady, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and exotic locations for filming, Paris and Casablanca. They meet and fall in love in Paris, just before the Nazi invasion. Ilsa is secretive about her past ... making her *even* more alluring and desirable ... She and Rick agree to meet at the railroad station and leave Paris due to the German occupation. Rick waits for her until the last minute but she does not show up ... He leaves without her.<br /><br />Ilsa and her husband, Viktor Laszlo end up in Casablanca at \\"Rick's Cafe Americain\\" where Ilsa sees Sam, the piano player from Paris. She asks him to play her favorite song, but he declines ... she asks again -- he succumbs. Rick enters and chides Sam, \\"I told you never to play that song again,\\" then he sees Ilsa ... He is introduced to her husband. That night after closing the cafe, Rick drinks himself into a stupor, remembering their days in Paris together. The Nazis visit the cafe and sing their national anthem, after which the French patriots stand up and sing their national song. The Chief of Police is forced to close the cafe as the plot thickens ... Rick is believed to possess secret documents that Ilsa and her husband need to leave Casablanca legally. Viktor is engaging in espionage against the Nazis and could be discovered at any time. Ilsa has an unexpected rendevous with Rick in the middle of the night, trying to extract the necessary documents from Rick ... In order to discover how it ends, to fully appreciate the intrigues, plot developments, wonderful acting, and mystique of the film ... one must view it.<br /><br />There are numerous phrases and statements that are well known which originated in this film, for example, \\"Here's looking at you kid\\", \\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world, you had to come to this one\\", and \\"Line up the usual suspects\\". This film is a classic due to the complex story line that unfolds within a love triangle.

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's classic novel To Kill a Mocking Bird is about a family in a racially divided town of Alabama in 1932 that is going through harsh times.  The youngest Finch, Scout, is the main character and narrator of the story.  You see and feel the whole story through the eyes of the daughter of Atticus Finch, who is representing the accused Tom Robinson.  Tom Robinson, a crippled Negro, has been accused of the rape and abuse of young Mayella Ewell. <br /> Scout tells the story of her adventures with her brother Jem and their neighbors nephew Dill.  The three children were very frightened, but also curious about their other neighbors, the Radleys.  It was said that Boo Radley was crazy, stabbed his own father, and was chained up in the house.  Their adventures include a visit beyond the gate of the Radleys, putting on skits of what they thought was going on in the Radley home, and trying to stick a note on Boo's window to find any means of communication possible.  All along, the children were assuming that Boo was dangerous and crazy.  Little did they know, in the end he would be the one to save their lives. <br /> While the children were fascinating about Boo, Atticus was being criticized and even his children were being threatened, all because he was defending a black man.  Atticus was a smart man with strong beliefs, determined to set a good example for his children and the people in his community.  Tom was falsely charged guilty because, unfortunately, the community he lived in was still filled with racism.  Even though Atticus had promised Tom that he would find justice and bring fairness to the town, Tom's inability to trust Atticus's sure word led to a frantic panic, and then death. <br /> Both stories tie in together.  Atticus once said in the book that you never knew a person until you put on their shoes and walked around in them a little bit.  The children were judging Boo Radley without having ever seen him before, and definitely never got to know him atall.  Tom Robinson was being judged by the jury and town because he was black.  Nobody knew who he was, and just stereotyped him to be a bad, scary man who raped and abused Mayella, even if he did have a cripple left hand. <br />
B00005NTN5|4.0|and alot more.  The Wachowski Brothers have a great film here that knows exactly what it is:  great suspense, smart enough to make sense and a thrill a second joy ride.  BOUND is an ultimate guilty pleasure, but for all the RIGHT reasons!  Solid performances from Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly and John Ryan, in his best role since KOJAK (\\"Cop In A Cage\\" 1974).  Tom Jones sings \\"She's A Lady\\"...RIGHT!!!
B000001IQH|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the top five albums of the 1990's. The immense number of radio songs notwithstanding, the space between them is filled with phenomenal basslines, passionate (if untalented) vocals, and just the noise made by four guys who really, truly, love music. That's the one thing I respect most about Rancid: From the first selftitled up through Indestructible, you know that they're in a band because they love what they do, not for money or fame. Nowhere is this more clear than on this record. <br /> <br />I was going to list the highlights, but then I realized that every one of the 19 tracks is great. Seriously. If we go with the five-star system, I think the only song that gets less than four stars in my book is \\"The Way I Feel\\", and it still gets 3.5. While I'm a Green Day fanatic for life, Rancid is only a half-step behind.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|This album is fun, great, and would probably spark less controversy if people would realize it's just music and it won't change your life.  I think they people who give FF a bad review were expecting them to be the next Belle and Sebastian or Smiths or something.  FF are a fun dance band, and THAT'S IT.  Buy and enjoy.  And especially enjoy the John-Taylor-esque bass lines!  Duran Duran would be proud.
B00005AFVR|1.0|Bruce Springsteen missed an opportunity to produce Live Box-Set Two. Unlike \\"Live 1975 to 1985\\", he could have balanced the effort from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at Madison Square Garden 2000. At this stage of his career, it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues. Instead, a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue, according to the set lists of these ten shows. If Bruce saw this and implemented it, he could have produced another masterpiece for his fans. Instead, the fans received an edited show with broken atmosphere. Any new and rare live songs were included as an afterthought. I find it hard to believe that a Bruce Springsteen live CD could be this bad. It only accomplished to capitalize on the margin of time it took to release the much better DVD product.
B00000DR5I|5.0|This is certainly one of the best electronic albums I have ever heard. It's chilling and creepy and horrifying and delightful, with tinges of melancholy and sadness. The two 17-minute long pieces take you for a journey to the outer (or inner?) space where you just let yourself be carried away by the current of the pulsating electronic beat. The sounds come and go like shapelss animals parading just before your eyes (ears?).  <br />The first part begins slowly with a relaxing flowing sounds to throw your mind into a soundtunnel, first gently, the beat emerges from the oblivion, but it soon picks up momentum and you are taken aback by the wall of sounds that dazzles you and leaves you in awe, as the music ceases to end the first movement. <br />The second part starts off like a horryfying nightmare, then again the pulsating bass enetrs to once more take you on a crazy ride on the oceans of imagination. Soundtunnel of mind, sounds and shapes that pass you by as you flow, freed from all earthly cares. Then the music gets more melancholic: with Peter Bauman's lonely flute leading us out of the dream, delicately restoring our senses.  <br />We are awake and realize we want to return, and we return, this is how my (tangerine) dream began... It still goes on... I'm inviting you to this magnificent world where music interplays with imagination. Come and enjoy, you'll like it. <br /> <br />Practical note: if you can, buy the 1995's Virgin  Definitive Edition or any that has been remastered. The sound should be much better, so your listening enjoyment will not be spoiled. Cheers:)
6305558167|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This is a movie about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  Thus, it is a movie about wizards, kings, queens, warriors, swords, sorcery, and desire.  It can also be thought of as an epic tale of rape, war, incest, regret, and ultimately redemption.<br /><br />This movie begins with some written text:<br /><br />\\"The land was divided and without a king.<br />Out of those lost centuries rose a legend...<br />Of the sorcerer Merlin,<br />And the coming of a King,<br />Of the sword of Power...<br />Excalibur.\\"<br /><br />All the elements of Sir John Malory's 1485 book or \\"compilation\\" entitled \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" (\\"The Death of Arthur\\") from which this movie is adapted are here:<br /><br />(1) The lust that leads to Arthur's father (Gabriel Byrne) giving up the infant Arthur to the cunning wizard Merlin (Nicol Williamson)<br />(2) Arthur (Nigil Terry) removing the sword \\"Excalibur\\" from the stone and so becoming King of Camelot<br />(3) King Arthur taking his queen, Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi)<br />(4) The love triangle that develops between King Arthur, Guenevere, and Sir Lancelot (Nick Clay)<br />(5) The Round Table's birth and eventual decline<br />(6) The attempts to recover the Holy Grail<br />(7) The power shift between Merlin and the evil sorceress Morgana (Helen Mirren)<br />(8) The battle between King Arthur's forces and his son Mordred's (Robert Addie) forces.<br /><br />All the above actors and the ones not mentioned do good jobs in their roles.  Nigil Terry as King Arthur and Nicol Williamson as the sly and humorous Merlin do especially good jobs.  Look for Liam Neeson (this was his second movie) and \\"Star Trek's\\" Patrick Stewart (his fourth movie) in small but notable roles.<br /><br />The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.  Battle scenes are well done.  The scenes involving \\"The Lady of the Lake\\" are also well done.  All costumes are authentic looking especially the battle armor.<br /><br />The music is exhilarating.  The main background music is that of composer Richard Wagner and that of composer Carl Orff.  Watching King Arthur and his warriors go off to battle with Orff's composition \\"O Fortuna\\" as the background music is unforgettable!<br /><br />Finally, the DVD extra where there is a commentary by director John Boorman is very detailed and interesting.  Be aware that this commentary is as long as the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, good acting, amazing cinematography, and exhilarating music make this an unforgettable movie!!<br /><br />(1981; 2 hr, 20 min; 44 scenes; rated R; widescreen; color)<br /><br />+++++g.

B000006NPY|1.0|From Billy Corgan, rock god, to Billy Corgan, uncle fester lookalike. <br /> <br />From Jimy Chamberlin, superstar drummer, to Jimy Chamberlin, out of the band. <br /> <br />There's nothing about this record to suggest it's the same band that made Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream. I don't know why people would like this one, but if you're into music without drums or guitars, and instead with a lot of angsty introspective whining... still, don't buy it. Can't recommend this under any circumstances.

B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm in love with this album. They do remind me of Joy Division. Paul Banks does sound a bit like Ian Curtis. But this album is genius. <br />The guitar parts are simple and repetetive, but that's exactly what makes it so striking. Repetition can be annoying, but this is put together in such a way that it will bring tears to your eyes. They seem to use the same techniques in every song, but the songs still stand apart from each other. Each is their own story, their own color. <br /> <br />Banks uses straight-up cliches in the lyrics, but cancels them out with such brilliant lines as I want your silent parts/ the parts the birds love/ I know there's such a place (Say Hello To The Angels). <br /> <br />This album is crawling with all kinds of genius. It's sweeping and beautifully mechanical. Like shadows of varying darkness slicing into a wall, like smoke rings, like a Mondrian painting, like noticing small details for the first time.
0783225857|3.0|I love classics, Black and White Films and even slow paced Hitchcock films. I agree they dont make films like they used to. I agree the golden era of cinema has long since passed. <br />This film, and i can see how it is considered a classic, is descent but boring. Especially now in 2004. <br />WIth all the great reviews (due mainly because its a classic) will have you thinking this must be an amazing black and white film! <br />Well if you expect that, especially with todays fast paced films where the camera cant stand still for seconds on a character, you will find this film unbelievably boring. <br />Give me Hitchcock, James Dean, Marlon Brando's black and white films, Bogart, James Stewart <br />BUt this film will bore u  <br />and the kids-- u will want to kill them <br />

B0001I561Y|5.0|Aladdin is my favorite Disney film of all time, and when it came out in theaters I was obsessed with it, which is why I was thrilled when I heard that it was finally going to be released on DVD in October 2004.<br /><br />Being such a huge fan of the film, I just had to get the deluxe edition set, and I was not disappointed.  The film is brilliantly rendered, with awesome sound and picture quality, the special features are incredibly entertaining and informative (I especially enjoyed the featurettes about the music of the film) and the artwork is wonderful to look at.  The music videos were neat, but honestly, I did not care for Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's version of \\"A Whole New World\\".  I'm sure Disney probably stuck it on there to appeal to the younger crowd, which is OK.  Besides, if you don't like it, thanks to DVD you can just elect not to watch it!  I really liked the deleted song \\"Proud of Your Boy\\", though:  both the original and the Clay Aiken version.<br /><br />The book that accompanies the set is beautiful and very well done and the film cel is suitable for framing, as are the sketches.  I'd be proud to display them in my home, and hope to do so one day.<br /><br />I was 15 when Aladdin came out in theaters in 1992, and I recently turned 27.  I can't believe so many years have passed since the film's release and it is still the most beloved Disney film to me.  Everyone will enjoy it, and I mean that.<br /><br />The story is the same:  In the city of Agrabah, an evil sorcerer schemes to obtain the key to the Cave of Wonders and finds it in Aladdin, a 'street rat' who has to steal food from the marketplace in order to survive, along with his faithful companion Abu, a sweet and mischevious little monkey.  Aladdin meets Princess Jasmine, who escaped the palace so her life wouldn't be lived for her, and falls madly in love with her.

B000001E8P|5.0|The other reviews pretty much said it all, so I'll just say: It's catchy, clever, and so sexy you'll want to collapse whimpering at Jarvis Cocker's feet. Where else can you hear a skinny, awkward-looking British man singing about doing other men's wives? You need this album. Buy it. Love it. Let it fill your wee Britpop-loving heart with...erm, Britpop love.
0316776963|4.0|This was my first David Sedaris book, and I'm definitely planning on reading one or more of the others. Very witty, somewhat caustic sense of humour. The chapters are unrelated, which makes this is a good book to have with you for those times when you need something to read while waiting (for whatever - doctor's appointment, your kid's little league game, etc.)
B0000028M7|5.0|You get Them Bones, and you get Would?. Yes, AiC has many more good songs, but those two are their best. Strongly recommend.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Much to my surprise it seems a lot of die hard Gn'R fans have been heavily criticizing this \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD collection. You want to know why? Because they claim (a) Guns N' Roses only released four albums, therefore they are not \\"allowed\\" to have Greatest Hits; (b) most of the Greatest Hits can be found on Appetite for Destruction; and (c) Axl Rose and co. protested its release, so why shouldn't the fans? <br /> <br />Last time I checked Axl and co. were suing the producers of a CD entitled \\"Hollywood Rose\\" -- NOT the Greatest Hits Collection. I could be wrong, but I doubt very much that Gn'R bandmembers have the time to sue two different CD producers at the same time -- merely because they feel they're getting jipped. Besides, they're getting money from Greatest Hits -- it's the Hollywood Rose album they understandably tried to keep out of print. <br /> <br />As for the jerks who claim Appetite for Destruction -- their SECOND album contrary to popular belief -- is the source of all their Greatest Hits, they're forgetting Civil War, Yesterdays, One in a Million, November Rain and Sympathy for the Devil -- some of my personal favorites. <br /> <br />I only started getting into Gn'R recently. I had always heard them referenced as gods of rock but also as a source of '80s ridicule -- now being very outdated as stupid punk rocker sell-outs. <br /> <br />But I think they're wonderful and some of my favorite songs of all-time are here. <br /> <br />Gn'R officially released five albums; most people believe Appetite for Destruction was their first, but it wasn't. After that they released Use Your Illusion I and II simultaneously. It had a lot of so-called \\"filler\\" (some underrated, some just OK and a bit egotistical like Get in the Ring). Then came The Spaghetti Incident?, full of cover tracks. It marked the beginning of their downfall as it didn't do very well with the critics and they slowly slid out of mainstream popularity... <br /> <br />Since then they've pretty much split up, Axl Rose buying the rights to Gn'R and releasing the song \\"Oh My God\\" on the \\"END OF DAYS\\" soundtrack (it's actually a pretty good song). <br /> <br />Which brings me to my next complaint. All these people keep saying, \\"Instead of a Greatest Hits, why don't they just release Chinese Democracy?\\" <br /> <br />Get real. First of all Geffen Records is not responsible for that. Axl is. He's delaying the release, along with his new bandmembers. It's HIS fault it's not released. Geffen's decision to release a Best-Of is completely understandable. For some people, buying four different CDs is not an option -- they just want some of Gn'R most popular, and best, songs, and then they can take it from there. <br /> <br />To all you Gn'R snobs, stop putting down this CD just because of this. You seem to take pride in the fact that you're lucky enough to know the \\"secret\\" that all their best tracks are on Appetite for Destruction. Good for you. Now stop complaining and start realizing some people like tracks off of Illusions and Spaghetti, too. <br /> <br />I find these people to be hypocrites -- they criticize The Best of Gn'R because they want Chinese Democracy instead. Then all they do is complain about Axl and his new bandmembers, and how they think he is a sell-out. Well which is it: Do you want Chinese Democracy, or not?! <br /> <br />Personally Sweet Child O'Mine is my favorite of theirs, followed by Sympathy for the Devil and then Knockin' On Heaven's Door -- the latter two of which are covers (for Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, respectively). <br /> <br />Which brings up another good point -- this is the first time Sympathy for the Devil has been made available on a Gn'R CD (it was originally recorded for the Interview with the Vampire Official Soundtrack, but never released through Gn'R as they were in the process of splitting up and never released another CD).  <br /> <br />Many of the diehard snobs think it shouldn't be included because it's not an \\"official\\" Gn'R recording. Whatever. It's one of their best songs, and it's the first time it's been made available -- unless you want to go buy the Vampire soundtrack... <br /> <br />All in all this contains some truly great tracks. Sweet Child, Civil War, Yesterdays, Sympathy, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Paradise City, Patience -- all classics. I could go on and on telling you why you should buy this, and putting down the diehard snob criticiziers, but I won't. Suffice to say if you're new to Gn'R you should really start here as it contains their best stuff -- then slowly move out into some of the more underrated and obscure material found on Spaghetti, Use Your Illusion, etc. <br /> <br />And if you've become a diehard fan like me (well, maybe not diehard, but supportive and enthusiastic) the Greatest Hits is still a great collection for obvious reasons. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for fans and non-fans alike.
B00006JDS4|5.0|Disturbing.  Shocking.  Repulsive.  Powerful.  Filmed nearly documentary style, with very little musical score, this film has a sense of urgency, of power, and of helplessness.  Loosely based on a true storey (AKA:  The Day of the Woman) this film was banned just about everywhere and is not for everyone.  There are extremely graphic rape scenes in this film.  They are so shocking that they seem real.  After being brutalized, beaten, raped, and tortured (the entire first 48 minutes of the movie) she cleans herself up, and seeks revenge.  What she went through, no jury would convict her.  Believe me, her revenge is sweet, savage, shocking, graphic, and just desserts to her assailants.  Wow!  Some argue that this film exploited women.  These people didn't wait until the end.
630521610X|5.0|The casting department did a great job of picking the right people for the right parts. A combination of Kevin Williamson's clever script and Wes Cravens masterful direction made this into a great movie.  The opening scence with Drew Barrymore is similar to the opening scene with Carol Kane in \\"When A Stranger Calls\\".
B000000WJZ|5.0|I just got this CD this summer. Yes, it's 2004. I had no idea what I was missing. This is one of the great ones. This, Dookie, Vs, Superunknown. Own those or you don't have any right to talk about rock.
0393316041|5.0|I had read the book in seventh grade, but after re-reading it this year, I have gotten so much more out of it.  During my first read, I enjoyed it because of the quirky nature of Mr. Feynman.  I remembered very little, except that it was a fun read.  After this last read, I can relate much more the Feynman because I can relate better to more of his book.  Although I am no longer the inquiring mind that I once was (because of the strict constraints of school), I am more mature and can see the depth behind Feynman.  He is an extremely unique man, and it shows throughout his book.  His book isn't bogged down with the extraneous physics concepts that he must have to have been included in the Manhattan project, but he explains the concepts in English.  The short 'chapters' of the book also make it an easy read.  There are short insights into Feynman's life, and once you get dipped in, you get pulled back out into a different part of his life.   <br /> <br />His common sense and aptness to see the easy way through a problem is the best part of the book.  He is the kind of person that, instead of working for 45 minutes, would rather think for 30 minutes and work for thirty minutes.  Instead of 45 minutes of labor, there are only 30 minutes of labor.  He finds the easy way through things.  Unfortunately, this also shows the rigidness of society, especially while he is a child.  His experience working shows how society is resistant to change.  Although his ideas are great and more efficient, his boss and co-workers laugh at his innovation because of slight mishaps.  He is the epitome of anyone who feels trapped within society's tight bounds.  He shows you a different perception of the world that helps you free yourself from those tight bounds.   <br /> <br />In the end, although the entire book is interesting, the take-home message is not to take anything 'proven' or ingrained, for granted.  Prove it to yourself, instead of believing what people say.  From Feynman's childhood experiences, to his life in college and beyond, he jumps at opportunity to learn, and show himself what most people assume are true.
B0002V7ODI|4.0|The 3 disc set, loaded with extras is well worth the extra money.  The extended scenes are blended in with the regular film, seemlessly added.  Some scenes I can see why they didn't make the cut.  Ususually for time constrants.  Still there are some extra scenes that are a treat.  They fill a small void that was in the theatrical version.  Fans can rejoice!  A sequel is coming.  The special effects are flawless, however I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the computer generated critters.  They were also kind of dull for monsters, but the action is aplenty.  Ron Pearlman is great as Hellboy.  He gives the character a human edge, and that helps greatly.  A good movie that could have been great, but still well worth the money.  Trade in the old PG13 version and buy this one.
B00004XQP4|2.0|I don't know what exactly Green Day was thinking on this one- hey, let's make a lot of acoustic garbage after not putting out an album for 3 years! Yeah, good idea! If this record was any good, rock might not have gone to its current decrepid state over the past 4 years. But who am I to say. Back to Warning, it's the exact opposite of everything Green Day does well. Minority is one of about 3 good songs.
0156027321|4.0|This is not a full review of the book. I just wanted to share an insight I had about the plot of the book. <br /> <br />I just finished reading this book (for the first time), a few hours ago. It is clear that there are two &#34;stories&#34;, the &#34;good story&#34; with the animals and a &#34;dry yeastless prosaic story&#34;. We're supposed to infer the following parallels from comparing the two accounts : <br /> <br />&#34;Good story&#34; -&#62; &#34;Prosaic story&#34;  <br /> <br />1) Pi Patel -&#62; The human side of Pi Patel  <br /> <br />2) Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger -&#62; The dark, killing, cannibalistic side of Pi Patel  <br /> <br />3) Orange Juice, the Orang Utang -&#62; Pi's mother  <br /> <br />4) The Zebra -&#62; The Taiwanese crewman with the broken leg  <br /> <br />5) The Hyena -&#62; The dark, murdering, cannibalistic, deceitful side of the French cook  <br /> <br />6) The French castaway -&#62; The more human, pitiable persona of the French cook <br /> <br />Certain parts of the &#34;good story&#34; don't have easy parallels, like the meerkats and the acidic algal island. I think these are meant to be interpreted as pure religious allegory (e.g. the Garden of Eden where Pi, a combined Christ/Adam figure finds succour and plenty until curiosity drives him to the tree bearing forbidden fruit [the leafy fruits with human teeth within them], following which he is forever denied the original innocence of the &#34;garden&#34; and retreats from it). At least, that's my take on it.  <br /> <br />It is interesting that in the &#34;good story&#34;, Richard Parker (RP) kills the hyena early on and then kills the French castaway much later on. To me this is an important symbolism : in the later &#34;prosaic story&#34;, Pi reveals that the French cook, after killing Pi's mother and partly cannibalising her, could have gone all the way and untied Pi's raft, leaving him to a slow death in solitude. But he did not, suggesting an attack of conscience (the book is heavy handed here, it even mentions the phrase &#34;bad conscience&#34;, not exactly subtle, IMHO). Moreover, when Pi climbs aboard and fights the cook, he gives in almost without a struggle, as if resigned to his punishment after the heinous crime of having butchered Pi's mother.  <br /> <br />Pi projects his own murderous, vengeful and cannibalistic qualities onto &#34;Richard Parker&#34;. Hence it's always the tiger who's doing the mauling, the killing and the man-eating. When RP kills the hyena after the hyena kills Orange Juice, it is an act of pure animal retribution. Pi sees himself (as RP) killing the dastardly animal part of the French cook, which is all he was able to see at that point in time.  <br /> <br />But upon later reflection, brought on my exposure, hunger, thirst, malaise and solitude, Pi unconsciously reflects on the morality of his actions. He now realises that the French cook was likely overcome by guilt at having killed a woman and basically offered himself up as a sacrifice to the knife wielded by Pi, who could have spared him, but in his rage, didn't. He visualises this as his RP projection pouncing upon a contrite and helpless French castaway and killing him without mercy.  <br /> <br />Two viewpoints of the same event, the lurid rationalisations of a shattering consciousness. <br /> <br />Then I had my really unsettling epiphany-of-sorts. There may be an &#34;even better&#34; story left untold. Not better in the moral sense, but certainly more savage and sad. <br /> <br />One curious thing you'll note about that delirious passage where Pi at first thinks Richard Parker (RP) is talking to him about non-veg dishes but then segues into the blind conversation with the other blind French castaway was that it seemed difficult to tell where one ended and the other began ! I now realise that this might have been intentional, and the author did this with exceedingly sinister intent. RP &#34;tells&#34; Pi he's killed twice before, a man first, then a woman second. This does not fit in with the rest of the parallels between the &#34;good story&#34; and the &#34;prosaic story&#34;. I believe we are correct in concluding that RP is indeed the projection of Pi's feral nature. Then we are led inexorable to only one thoroughly unpalatable (pun intended) conclusion :  <br /> <br />That Pi himself killed and ate both the French cook and his own mother. The Taiwanese crewman (the &#34;Zebra&#34;) may have certainly been dismembered by the French cook at the outset, but he wasn't callously butchered, he was simply left to die of &#34;natural&#34; causes.  <br /> <br />But Pi then killed the French cook and ate him. Maybe it happened in the heat of an altercation but it happened nonetheless. At this point, his mother was still alive. The French cook wasn't even guilty of harming Pi's mother, but Pi killed and ate him nonetheless.  <br /> <br />Now here's the really icky part, somewhere down the road, Pi, &#34;out of necessity&#34; (direct quote from the book), butchers and cannibalises his own mother.  <br /> <br />The memory of these horrific deeds is so traumatic to the 16-year old that he invents the &#34;good story&#34; fantasy with animals aplenty to mask what really happened. When forcefully probed by the Japanese investigators, he then comes up with a more plausible explanation (plausible here may mean plausible to his own psyche as well, surely no-one can believe they're capable of killing and eating their own mother ?!).  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, even that thoroughly gruesome and &#34;plausible&#34; account given at the end of the book may not be the &#34;true&#34; story. The true story may have been far more horrific, and even Pi himself is likely not consciously aware of what he did. He probably repressed everything that actually happened.  <br /> <br />Confabulation and selective amnesia, these are powerful defences of a psyche beset by such unnatural trauma.  <br /> <br />In the end, it is evident that even the Japanese investigators &#34;choose&#34; to buy into the &#34;good story&#34;. Both the &#34;prosaic story&#34; narrated at the end, and the untold true story are too painful to contemplate. We, as humans, simply cannot believe that such horrors lie hungering beneath our polished veneer, waiting to leap out and take us over at the merest hint of an opportunity.  <br /> <br />The book may therefore actually have been much, much darker than I first gave it credit for. Golding, eat your heart out !
B000000WA4|4.0|There's about one disc worth of good material on Mellon Collie. This is a two-disc set. Therefore, you have to pick and choose while you listen to it. Even so, it's just barely below the 'essential' level. There's a number of very good songs on here, and a few great ones.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I pretty much agree with everyone else's reviews except for the best tracks. In my opinion the best are: <br /> <br />1. New Workout Plan <br />2. We don't Care <br />3. Never let me down <br />4. All Falls Down <br />
B00009XITP|4.0|This movie is about being true to who you are and that all happiness comes from that place. <br /> <br />The movie is predictable and somewhat unrealistic...as a romantic, even I question two people being able to fall back into love immediately after 17 years apart. <br /> <br />Amanda Bynes is truly a talented young actress, and she does a great job.
B000089CJI|5.0|I first came across this CD back in the beginning of May.I was blown away by the diversity of each of the tracks, and how quickly I was drawn into the CD. I listened to it straight through the first few times, and each time I found myself yearning for more tracks. This CD simply belongs in a genre of it's own. It's such a great break from the cookie cutter cutout bands that are invading the airways and televisions right now. Anyone who appreciates true musical diversity should pick this album up. It is definitely a must have for any music lovers collection.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|What I like about this movie is what a great job it does in balancing the points of view about feminism and identity. Most movies take a single argument and defend it. This one presents independence, family, career, etc. as all equal choices...with the ultimate issue being what's right for each person is something you have to find on your own.  What works for one person maynot be right for everyone. That's a hard position to take in a movie, and this one does a great job.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray Lamontagne sings his songs with such soul and passion, and without pretention, that he makes many other current artists pale in comparison. When I first heard his music, I thought his music was refreshingly honest and the kind of music I've not heard in a long while. His lyrics are heartfelt and personal, and they make this whole album a wonderful experience. Favorite songs include: Jolene, Shelter, and Trouble.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is the movie to watch when you need a reaffirmation of the power of love. The interweaving characters and themes is well done...my favorite story is the couple who fall in love without speaking the same language. <br /> <br />If you don't believe in love...stay away from this movie!
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|I am a big Nightwish fan, and I must say I like this disc very much.  Why then did I rate this disc a little low?  Because, unlike several of their other discs, this one's songs were \\"hit or miss.\\"  I really liked, \\"Dark Chest of Wonders,\\" \\"Wish I had an Angel,\\" \\"Creek Mary's Blood,\\" \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" and \\"Live to Tell the Tale.\\"  Unfortunately, the other songs pale in comparison.  I have other (Nightwish) discs where there's maybe one song I don't care for.  All-in-all though, it's worth buying!
B000001IPP|1.0|All the songs sound the same. <br />The singer can't sing. <br />Some of the songs are only a minute long. <br />It sounds like a dog went through the slaughterhouse.
0800141660|5.0|This superbly acted film draws you into the world of the Dashwood sisters and compels you to care for them and their woes and joys.  Everything from the scenery, to the costumes to the excellent cast make this a film to view over and over again. It is so engagging that you do not have to be an Austen fan to appreciate it; but if you are an Austen fan, you will appreicate how well the film captures the \\"feel\\" of the novel. <br />I wish I could give it 6 stars.
B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana's first album, 1989's \\"Bleach\\" has a much different sound than their later releases. The band sounds a lot heavier, rawer, and somewhat amateur - understandable as they recorded the songs in a garage for $600. Kurt Cobain's songwriting hasn't quite blossomed yet either, and as a result some songs just don't click and sink into the well of sludge. But despite these setbacks, Nirvana's debut is, on the whole, satisfying, fascinating, and as time would tell, revolutionary.    Blew - A good opener. The main riff, chorus, and Kurt's solo make this song a great example of what 1980s Nirvana sounded like.  Floyd the Barber - Great song. The stop-start rhythm and haevy drum beats are great, and the lyrics - from the viewpoint of a child getting a haircut - are both funny and creative. Nice solo as well.  About A Girl - One of the best-known songs off the album, probably because it's the only track that really rises above the churning, sludgy grunge and finds Kurt hitting some high notes. A well-written, catchy, emotional song  School - Another highlight of the album. Features good guitar work and vocal delivery from Kurt, even with just three sentences of lyric. Nice drumming as well.  Love Buzz - Great song, a cover of a Robby Van Leeuwen track. Kurt shines on this one, vocals and guitar.  Paper Cuts - Very heavy and grungy. Not one of my favorites, but an above average listen. Strange and somehwat psychadelic.  Negative Creep - Aw, yeah! How can you not love this one. Big, loud, lunkheaded, and churning, with a great chorus (I'm sorry, Kurt says \\"Daddy\\" like \\"Johnny\\").  Scoff - The opening drums kick ass. This one's real emotional, and Kurt's delivery varies between frenzied and pained. Perhaps my favorite song off the album.  Swap Meet - That sound at the very beginning is pretty cool, but this one's just average. The chorus is alright, but other than that, nothing special. I do like the guitar-driven part from 1:54 to 2:07, though.  Mr. Moustache - I like this one, if only for its pure craziness and recklessness. A real fun song to listen to.  Sifting - Meh...not my cup of tea. Just too slow and nothing special worth noting. And at 5:22, it's way too long and monotonous to get into.  Big Cheese - An uptick from Sifting, but still not great. Kind of interesting, though...the chorus is pretty cool.  Downer - Weird. Flies by in 1:42, and basically consists of a loopy chorus and Kurt spewing words way too fast to understand. Pretty unspectacular as well, but compare it to anything on MTV or the Top 40 nowadays, and you have a masterpiece. Voila!    So there you go. An album with a harsh, bleak surface, but it hides some very good songwriting beneath its murky veneer. A promising debut from a band that would go on to have one hell of a career.     OVERALL GRADE: B+
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Yes, it's not the book...what did you expect?   <br />This movie portrays the book better than anything could.  It brings major entertainment with it, whether you've read the book or not.  PoA is my favorite HP movie yet.  I liked the first two, they told the story...the end.  The third movie tells the story and you feel emotion!  I was so missing emotion in the first two.  PoA makes you feel so much for Harry...This movie is really great!  The actors have matured so much too!  The best yet!
B00005JN4O|5.0|i just finished watching finding neverland. I thought the movie was very good. Johnny Depp gives a great performance as the late James Barrie. this is definitly one of the best movies i've seen this year. I'm waiting to see how Alexander turns out and a few other movies to finally decide which movie is at the top. Ray was also very good. Jamie foxx's preformance comes very close to Johnny Depp's in Finding neverland. it'll be a hard decision on oscar night i can tell you that.
B00005JMJG|3.0|If you liked Vanilla Sky or if you're really into artistic movies then you will most likely enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  As for the performances go, the lead actors/actresses (Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood) all do an excellent job in portraying realistic, believable characters in a far fetched plot.  The basic plot of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is neat idea but at times it lacks clarity (which is the point) and at other times it leaves rather large holes in the plot.  But it is a veru decent movie and I recommend giving it a try. <br /> <br />Here's an overview of the story (without giving away important details): <br /> <br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet find themselves involved in an unconventional relationship.  They both erase each other from their memories when things go badly.  They then desperately try to undo this decision they've made and run from its consequences.  To further the ensuing drama between these two characters, the doctors involved in this procedure have their own ideas and agendas. <br /> <br />In order to fully appreciate Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, suspend your disbelief, don't try to hard to figure everything out and sit back and enjoy the movie.
B000001FTD|5.0|If your looking for outstanding Thrash Metal, this is it. <br /> <br />Yeah, a few of the songs on this CD have lyrics are a little funny and goofy, but the music is awesome!! <br /> <br />Songs like One World and Indians are very serious songs that talk about Political stuff. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"I am the Law\\" is talking about Judge Dread/comic book character/Silverster Stallone movie. <br /> <br />\\"Caught in a Mosh\\" is talking about a dysfunctional family. <br /> <br />They also have some songs that are sarcasims and critizisms about how backwards and how ridculous society can be, for example:  \\"Imatiation of Life\\" and \\"N.F.L.\\" (I won't translate what that actually means, and no, it does not mean National Football League either). <br /> <br />\\"Among the Living\\" title-song is talking about an Antichrist type of person.  A killer, liar, and brainwasher who is out and about in society preying on innocent people like a wild animal stalking its prey. <br /> <br /> <br />The cover of this CD can be taking 2 ways: <br /> <br />1.  This guy in the top-hat is the only one alive among dead people, by the way that he is similing while everyone else has a life-less look on their face. <br /> <br />2.  This guy in the top-hat is the Antichrist type of guy who is out to prey on his victims. <br /> <br /> <br />If you want kick-butt Thrash Metal, and AnTHRaX's best CD, and probably the definition of Thrash Metal, GET THIS CD NOW!!!! <br />
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Obviously Mr. &quot;heidikakes&quot; down there doesn't have a clue.  He slaughtered this album in the most mindless ways insulting it as if it were his mission in life to do so.  This guy obviously is not a musician and he also obviously does not understand music in the slightest.  What kind of moron trashes an album so utterly and completely in the fashion that he did?  Really heidikakes you must have some serious anger issues.  Did you get beat up in the schoolyard by The Strokes?  Seriously, dude, you need therapy.<br />Besides getting my beef with that idiot off my chest I would like to say that if you are an intelligent person and a music lover you will enjoy this music a LOT.  The Strokes' sophomore effort is better than their first disc in my opinion, and it sounds so much more like rock than a lot of bands that are out there these days.  Give this one a listen, I guarantee it will not be anything like what heidikakes claims it is.
B00005JN4O|5.0|The role of unpredictable writer J.M. Barrie is one that Johnny Depp was born to play. Only an actor who blends eccentricity and sensitivity as seamlessly as Depp could ever think of inhabiting an artist who created a literary world of pirates, fairies and pixie dust to combat the social pressures and personal tragedies that torment humanity. As I watched Depp morph into the 19th century British aristocrat that crafted the unforgettable adventures of Peter Pan, I was stunned to find that many of the nuances and emotions that had characterized his most memorable performances were coalescing before my eyes: I saw the abiding sweetness of Edward Scissorhands mingling with the unbridled optimism and energy of Ed Wood and the sheer lust for life that inhabited Captain Jack Sparrow. The result is a performance that is as dynamic, affecting and disarmingly enjoyable as any I've seen this year, and one that defines the persona and uniqueness of Johnny Depp just as clearly as the part of Rhett Butler revealed all the priorities and charm of Clark Gable. Even without such a brilliant star turn, Finding Neverland would still be an extremely pleasant and moving parable about the use of creativity and imagination to confront personal demons, but Depp elevates the film into the realm of magic. <br /> <br />When the movie commences, Barrie's life is in dismal condition. His latest play is an unqualified disaster, his producer Charles Frohman (a very amusing Dustin Hoffman) has little faith in his future prospects as a writer, and he is trapped in a confining marriage to a humorless social climber (Radha Mitchell). Things take a turn for the better when he encounters the Davies family, a harried brood that consists of four boys and widowed mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet). Their lives have been dispirited since the death of the patriarch, and they will come to know more suffering when Sylvia begins showing the symptoms of consumption. Barrie revives the passion and purpose in his own life by teaching the Davies boys to mitigate their grief through whimsy and imagination, and the innocence and playfulness of the children ultimately inspires the timeless story of Peter Pan.  <br /> <br />In several marvelously inventive and well-constructed sequences, director Marc Forster cuts between the elaborate fantasy worlds imagined by Barrie and the children and the prosaic backyard circumstances they are escaping. Depp transforms himself into pirate captains, Indian chiefs and circus performers with incredible style and panache, and his sheer giddiness is always infectious among the audience. Such outlandishness is always thrilling to watch, but Depp is equally effective in quieter and more reflective moments. He conveys an appropriate mix of frustration and pity in his conversations with his chilly wife, and the scene in which he confides to Sylvia the tragic family history that led him to pursue a career as an imagineer is a masterpiece of restrained, heartfelt acting.       <br />  <br />Forster is to be congratulated for finding such brilliant child actors to play off of Depp's franticness and compassion. Freddie Highmore is unforgettable in the role of Peter, the pragmatic middle child who resists Barrie's games and adventures because they blind him to the important and tragic events occurring in his life. Highmore traces Peter's emotional journey with maturity and depth, best epitomized by his changing attitudes toward creative writing. Equally excellent is Nick Roud as eldest son George, who requires Barrie's help to balance the burgeoning responsibilities and maturity that come with adolescence and his own desire for fantasy and frivolity. And Luke Spill (playing the role of youngest child Michael Davies) is quite simply the most adorable moppet to grace the screen since Drew Barrymore in E.T. I defy any audience member not to lose their heart to him within thirty seconds of his arrival on screen. <br /> <br />Finding Neverland may focus most of its attention on the male bonding between Barrie and the Davies boys, but the women do not get lost in the shuffle. Although Mrs. Davies seems to exist initially as a romantic alternative to Mrs. Barrie, Sylvia movingly emerges as the greatest convert to Barrie's glorious world of make-believe. As her health deteriorates, she relies on magic and fantasy to bring her hope and hold her family together. Winslet plays the role with an astonishing mix of resoluteness and vulnerability, and she will probably be joining Depp as one of this year's most prominent Oscar contenders. Veteran actress Julie Christie also deserves a great deal of credit for humanizing the essentially villainous character of Mrs. Du Maurier, Sylvia's rigid mother. Her eyes and body language always capture the essence of a woman who wishes to protect her daughter at any cost, even when her dialogue characterizes her as a one-note harpy bent on driving Barrie's imaginative nonsense from the family household.                <br /> <br />Despite reports from the Barrie estate that Finding Neverland distorts many of the events in the writer's life, the film is always true to his spirited personality and literary priorities. Barrie was an illusionist who would have welcomed any creative touches that might have rendered his life story more exciting, uproarious or touching, if only to inspire and enchant the audience. He would have adored this thought-provoking gem of a movie and treasured Depp's bravura performance, just as audiences will today.    <br />
B000006TRV|3.0|While I used to hate this album, I now think it's alright... not Pink Floyd's best, and DEFINITELY not the best rock album ever recorded. There are too many brief, interlude-type 'songs.' As a number of other reviewers have pointed out, this album is seriously lacking in contributions from Richard Wright (who I consider the best singer in the band by far) and David Gilmour (save a co-writing credit on Comfortably Numb and a couple others and a wonderful lead vocal on Goodbye Blue Sky and I think a couple more). While those two songs plus Hey You are among PF's best, there are alot of mediocre, overrated songs, including Young Lust (generic late 70s hard rock, not befitting a band as talented as PF) and Run Like Hell.  <br /> <br />Since alot of people new to Pink Floyd are steered to this first, to them I say make this your sixth or seventh Pink Floyd purchase. Ahead of it, get: <br /> <br />1. Dark Side of the Moon (possibly the best rock album ever) <br />2. Piper at the Gates of Dawn (where it all began) <br />3. Wish You Were Here (classic songs, very accessible) <br />4. Meddle (contains the full version of Echoes, PF's masterpiece, plus some other good ones.) <br />5. Animals (similar to The Wall, but MUCH stronger musically) <br />6. A Saucerful of Secrets (unfairly oft-maligned, contains some overlooked gems) <br /> <br />Then The Wall, or MAYBE <br />7. Obscured by Clouds (not a good introduction to Pink Floyd, but contains some really beautiful acoustic songs.) <br /> <br />So all in all, a valiant effort, strong story. Just lacking a certain band chemistry and musicality.
B000002MP2|5.0|Really awsome for any Green Day fan, but if you're not, step away. I, being a HUGE Green Day fan, think that you'll LOVE most of these songs, I recomend \\"Pulling Teeth\\",\\"Basket Case\\", \\"Longveiw\\" and \\"Welcome to Paradise\\". The only song on this CD I don't LOVE is \\"Coming Clean\\", not really interesting. All really strict parents who hate cuss words as small as \\"crap\\", this is a bad CD for your kids.

B000268QB2|5.0|What do Keane, Coldplay, Travis, Doves and Starsailor have in common? Most reviewers would argue that they all sound like Radiohead in one way or another (which is not untrue). I'd say too that they all have found an avenue into their souls, and they bring back a steady flow of emotions in their productions.<br /><br />Keane is the latest band of this kind to take the plunge, and they constitute one of the most solid musical debuts of 2004. I hadn't felt this way about a new act since the debut of Stills in 2003. But this Scottish trio wakes up things that may have been dormant for a bit. After the loss of their guitarist in 2002, the remaining members stepped into the world with a sound made up of Piano/Keyboards/Bass and Drums, and the voice of Tom Chaplin giving the magical final accent to the band's stamp.<br /><br />If you wanted to compare Keane to any other band, you could think of how Fran Healy, Travis' singer/songwriter would sound like accompanied by a Coldplay-like sound (but without the guitars) and you got a pretty good picture. But the truth is that, as many comparisons as you want to draw, Keane's sound is true to their heart, and because of that it is tough not to be touched by it. One of the best productions of 2004, Keane's \\"Hopes & Fears\\" is highly recommendable.
B0000025QC|5.0|I bought 'Down to the moon' a few days ago, it's OK. 'Caverna Magica' is for me the best of Andreas, a listening pleasure, worth the money. Thank you very much Mr. Vollenweider.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I've been quite critical of Marillion's work since their concept album 'Brave' back in the early 90s. Though 'Anoraknophobia' improved things, it still wasn't at the same level of creativity as they accomplished with that classic album that was meant to be played \\"loud and with the lights off.\\"<br /><br />Finally, in 2004 Marillion takes back on their \\"brave\\" sound and brings it to the next level, with their 'Marbles' album. This is a production where there are some extraordinary songs that have a 100% Marillion sound, with accents reminding of Pink Floyd and Genesis carefully sprinkled all through most of the longer tracks, which makes it is extremely difficult to pick favorite tracks. Perhaps the promotional \\"You're Gone\\" I could live without, but even that one is far from bad.<br /><br />All in all, my favorite tracks are:<br />-The Invisible Man: strong \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" influences to be felt in the beginning, due to its obscure nature, for the most part.<br />-Angelina: a more contemporary sound to it, but also bringing to mind works such as \\"Wish you were here\\".<br />-Neverland: Strong, up front Marillion, starting with H and a piano and bringing band members in as it grows, displaying some of the craftiest production details in the album.<br />-The four \\"Marbles\\": much more like the Marillion we learned to love in 'Brave'.<br /><br />The album comes not just as a great musical production, but also an attempt to break traditional music marketing and distribution schemes, something that they attempted their previous album, but didn't quite succeed at due to the shortcomings of their distribution deal. What you will listen to in 'Marbles' is an album whose production AND distribution was taken off the gound by thousands of fans that pre-ordered it even before it was recorded (something I was proud to be a part of).<br /><br />Once you listen to it, I think you will agree that breaking the ties from a recording contract can yield things that are extremely worth paying a little more for. And if you feel you can't get enough Marillion with this CD, there's more for you to dig into: go to Marillion.com and get the double CD, which includes much more, but in particular one of the best Marillion songs I've ever heard, called \\"Ocean Cloud\\". They definitely delivered on their promise to save some great stuff for the double-album edition that they made available, but they were also able to bring together some great material for this version of 'Marbles'.feel you can't get enough Marillion with this CD, there's more for you to dig into: go to Marillion.com and get the double CD, which includes much more, but in particular one of the best Marillion songs I've ever heard, called \\"Ocean Cloud\\".

0800177177|4.0|I was a junior in high school when this film first came out.  I went with one of my friends on one of the coldest Louisiana evenings of that year.  That cold atmosphere, along with the dark, damp and aging cinema that I saw the film in made \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" one of my favorite films of all time.  It's been awhile since I read the book, but I think the film follows the pages of Stoker's novel reasonably close, with a couple of adjustments in characters and in sequences(as is the usual for books-to-the-big-screen).<br /><br />One thing that I loved about this film is that it makes a decent attempt at connecting the story of Vlad Tepestt with that of Stoker's beloved vampire.  The opening sequence with Gary Oldman going to war and then coming home only to find his love to be dead was a great addition to the tale.  The sequence where Oldman denounces God was, to me, one of the most uncomfortable moments in film history.  God just isn't someone to mess with, but Oldman does it in convincing, over-the-top fashion.<br /><br />Oldman's performance is one of the best in this movie.  Sir Anthony Hopkins does well with Van Helsing.  His eccentric, out-there portrayal of the good doctor reminded me of another far out physician--Doctor Who(most notably Tom Baker's version of Who).  Winonna Ryder is sufficient as Mina, though her portrayal didn't come across as anything worth giving up your soul and becoming a condemned immortal for.  The three suitors of Lucy, played by Cary Elwes, Richard E. Grant and Bill Campbell were decently played.  Grant is perhaps the best, though his character is given more depth than the other two.  Campbell's performance came across as a little too stereotypical as the cowboy from Texas, but he sufficed.  Elwes, much like Keanu Reeves' Jonathan Harker, played his role in a stiff manner.  Reeves was okay, but I just kept waiting for him to go into \\"Bill and Ted\\" mode.  The rest of the cast was pretty good, especially Sadie Frost, who played Lucy Westenra.  She was devilishly dirty.  She was the perfect foil to Mina's wholesome looks and thoughts.  Ms. Frost was every bad man's fantasy in this flick.<br /><br />The movie was a marvel to look at.  The beautiful, gothic air about the entire film made me look beyond some of the less than stellar acting performances.  Some of the scenes were downright chilling, and the numerous beasts that Oldman took the form of were vile to look at.  The opening sequence, though shot in a silhouette style, showed great carnage as Vlad the Impaler took on his enemies.  The huge castle on a cliff, the carriage driver who picks up Harker, even the streets of London, all added to the atmosphere of this movie.  You also get to see two worlds at once in this movie.  One world, the cold, uncivilized world of savages(Dracula's Transylvania), and another, London on the brink of a new century.  It gives you the sense that an age is coming to an end and with it, the legends and myths of the old world.<br /><br />While not a complete masterpiece, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is a wonder to view.  It does take some liberties with the original novel if I remember correctly, but they don't take away from the overall story.  I would suggest you read the book, though, because it is better than this movie, or any other vampire film for that matter.ucy Westenra.  She was devilishly dirty.

6304981635|4.0|This movie shows Bruce Lee in top fighting form and also reminds me that he was a fine actor as well. The man actually had total muscle control and that even shows up in his facial expressions and speech. The movie itself isn't fantastic but by comparison (to any other martial arts film of the time) it's pretty good. The fight scenes are credible and I don't recall any glowing hands, jumping over houses or anyone clear cutting forests with his head. Some of the cinematography is very interesting too and I'm glad others noticed the similarity to the old James Bond flicks. I think the musical score has something to do with that.    Seeing this movie again makes me wonder what Bruce Lee could have done if he had stayed with us. He was truly remarkable and seemed to be getting better all the time.

It's underlying mystery, beautiful utterances and sense of energy is amazing.

B000001GAO|5.0|Lenny brings massive weight to the Requiem unlike any other I've heard!  The expansiveness and power is incredible.<br /><br />(If you're a purist, you will probably dislike this recording, but then why listen to it anyway if you know you won't like it?  Just stick to the &#34;Hoggy&#34;, &#34;Gardi&#34; and &#34;Pinni&#34; gang!  But leave the heavyweights like Klemp, Karajan, Lenny and those guys out of it).<br /><br />This is my second favorite Requiem I've heard after the Karajan 1977 version.  Bernstein brings a structure to the piece which other conductors often miss, and the musicians play with great feeling and firey intensity.<br /><br />It's a Requiem tailored for the big boned and manly type.  And by the way, it's a live recording...so all the better.<br /><br />-&#62;Get the most recent reissue of it on DG's &#34;entree&#34; label for dead cheap!

This is not to say this is a bad thing. <br />Waking life is an extremely cerebral film. This movie gets into one's head and fishes around until the thoughts inside your head are pulled struggling to the surface. From the director of Slackers this movie is anything but a slacker. When the movie ends, you want more even though you are reeling from the mental aerobics one goes through. In the exciting realism of the animation, you wonder how in the world they did it. Waking life is a waking dream come true. <br />
0761119752|5.0|I bought this book for my 8 month old nephew for Christmas last year.  At first he wasn't really interested in the book.  But after his mom read it to him a few times, he really got into it.  He loves to point at the colorful \\"jammies\\" that the animals are wearing in the book.  He also loves the Pjammy to the left...Pjammy to the right....part. We read it like a cheer and he just laughs and giggles at us. I've found it's one of his favorite books. He brings it with him everywhere he goes because it keeps him entertained.  I'm going to be sure to buy more books for him because they are all as entertaining as this one is. <br />
0887307280|1.0|This is simply a very poor book on the subject of small business.  Basically, Gerber tells you that you need to franchise your business.  That may be well and good, but what if you have a business that doesn't lend itself to franchising, like consulting?  After reading his book I felt as though I wasted my time.  I also felt mislead.  Because of the title I thought I going to read a book chock full of tips on how to run your small business better and which pitfalls to avoid.  Instead, I was treated to Gerber's horn blowing interlaced with a story about a woman he consulted and her pies.  My advice is to look elsewhere for business advice.

0140042520|4.0|Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his youthful days as an ebullient Zen Buddhist and rucksack hitchhiker in the 60's. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in a shack in Berkley, CA with his good friend Alvah Goldbook. Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the wilderness of Central California where they recite poetry, drink wine, meditate, make haikus about every natural object, while trying to find themselves and seek the true meaning of life as beatniks. Ray Smith also criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to Berkeley. While at home he wanders through forest time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, meditating there through the cold months like a real Buddhist Monk. <br /> <br />  I was surely impressed by this book. I even jotted down many meaningful Buddhist passages and quotes that Kerouac mentioned in the novel This work of literature by Kerouac is less \\"experimental\\" in literary terms compared to something like \\"Satori in Paris\\" by Kerouac. For those of you who have not had any past experience with Kerouac's writing style this will not be of any difficulty. The language is simple, the prose is right to the point, and there is hardly a bit of surrealism. Many of the sections are quite humorous because of the quirkiness and new ideas on Buddhism that are slipped in between the sentences, along with predictable scenes of the beatnik life hood (drug use and slang). Ray Smith purely goes about making light comments about life without being the author's speaker. This is a positive and heart fulfilling youthful adventure that displays immense compassion.
0156027321|5.0|I don't know if this book made me believe more in god than I already do, but I did enjoy the first one hundred pages of this book that discusses Pi's search for religion. But that is not why this book has done so well. This book has become a bestseller becuase it's the story of a young, intelligent boy who is stranded on a small lifeboat with a tiger, among other animals. As other reviewers have warned, this book is not for the weak stomached. Some scenes in the book are so disgusting they are difficult to read. Yet, the story is so compelling, I couldn't take my eyes from the page. I shivered and bore it, and I'm glad I did. This is a great book that can be read in a short time. The end of the book also throws in a twist that leaves the reader deep in thought.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought this album, knowing that it has been greatly ballyhooed, but not knowing exactly why.<br /><br />It took about 8 bars to figure it out.  This woman is an absolutely uncanny knockoff of Billie Holiday.  Her languid phrasing, her vocal range, her way of simultaneously clipping and elongating vowels, and her carrying the melody slightly behind the beat, all are knockoffs of Lady Day.  It's like Billie Holiday came back to earth and incarnated herself into the voice of Madeleine Peyroux.<br /><br />By this, I don't mean that Ms. Peyroux is some sort of singing Rich Little, \\"little voice\\" knock-off of Billie Holiday.  If that were the case, you'd be hearing Ms. Peyroux sing songs that made Lady Day famous.  Instead, the vocal portfolio here consists of songs by such songwriters as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and Hank Williams.  If Billie Holiday came back to earth, she would not be some Vegas lounge, retro-curiosity act, singing \\"Lover Man\\" 20 times a night.  She would be doing contemporary songs like this.  With Madeleine Peyroux, the spectrum continues, rather than is repeated.<br /><br />\\"Okay,\\" you say.  \\"She has the voice of Billie Holiday.  But does she have the soul?\\"<br /><br />I think so.  I say that because the material on this album isn't as strong as \\"Strange Fruit\\", \\"God Bless the Child\\", or \\"Some Other Spring,\\" to name but 3.  But \\"Weary Blues\\" has Lady Day's heaviness, \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" has her sense of longing, \\"This is Heaven to Me\\" has her bliss, and the rest projects the basic sadness of Lady Day.  And like Billie Holiday's songs, this album as a whole grows on you with each listen.<br /><br />What a year 2004 has been!  Andy Bey's \\"American Song\\";  Kitty Margolis' \\"Heart and Soul:  Live in San Francisco\\"; Luciana Souza's \\"Neruda\\"; Jackie Allen's \\"Love Is Blue\\"; and now this one.  (To name but five) I can't remember another year with so many strong vocal jazz albums.  I can't speak for the rest of jazz, but vocal jazz is alive and very well.  RC

But other than that, Eric played with a little more energy than some of his concerts I seen, the sound & video was excellent and there was a good cross section of music.   Also, not mentioned, but great to see was Steve Cropper & Duck Dunn backing up a couple of the acts.    I hope Eric makes this an event possibly yearly if not occasional.   I read Gary Moore was suppose to play, but had to bow out due to his injured hand.

I never read anything about this book, it came recommended to me by a friend who did not set up the scene for me.  I am normally a fan of easy reading chick lit books...but I found myself drawn to James...there is something about this book that grabs you and keeps you involved the entire time.  I had many emotions while reading this book, mostly I felt sad for this man, but I also found myself rooting for him and hoping for the best.  The book is not for those with a weak stomach, but if you can see pass some difficult stories, this is by far a fantastic book!

B00063MBU8|5.0|From the band that brought you \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\" comes Simple Plan's sophomore album, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" This album has already brought Simple Plan great success, debuting on US and Japan charts at #3 and Canadian charts at #2! The first single off their sophomore album, \\"Welcome To My Life\\" has already proven to be a strong single. Rising quickly on the Much Music chart in Canada and reaching #1 on MTV's TRL.  <br /> <br />\\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\" brought you such smash singles as \\"Addicted\\" and \\"Perfect\\" and in my opinion \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" will bring many more chart topping singles. Starting with the first track off their second album, \\"Shut Up!\\" This song is catchy and upbeat not much unlike their hit from 2003 \\"Addicted\\". Along with \\"Shut Up!\\" I believe that, \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Me Against The World\\" will become great hits as well.  <br />\\"Thank You\\" is contradicting from a first read at the title. This song is about someone that had a friend that let them down and they're thanking them for showing them that not everyone, including best friends, can be trusted. With lyrics that almost everyone can relate to and a great beat I see \\"Thank You\\" being a great song for Simple Plan.  <br />\\"Me Against The World\\" has to be my personal favourite on the album for the simple fact that it has amazing bass, guitar rifts and drumbeats provided by Jeff Stinco (lead guitar), Sebastien Lefebvre (guitar), David Desrosiers (bass), and Chuck Comeau (drums). Combined with lyrics that are fun to sing along to and great vocals provided by lead singer Pierre Bouvier this song I can see being a chart topper.  <br />Though Simple Plan may not always have the most serious lyrics the song \\"Crazy\\" proves that they do have a serious side. This song deals with very serious issues concerning today's youth and all around society. Such as, dieting, surgery, the need to be perfect, starvation, and societies obsession with money. I feel that this song wasneeded on this album to bring these issues to teenager's attention, especially those who may be dealing with some of those issues themselves. <br />Finally, I believe that the song \\"Untitled\\" is a great piece of work lyrically, vocally and musically. With simple piano and just the voice of lead singer Pierre Bouvier it is easy to see that there is a lot more behind this band than their pop-punk persona. Pierre's raspy voice fits the song \\"Untitled\\" perfectly. This song is very simple and played out extremely well, one of the best Simple Plan songs ever. \\"Untitled\\" is the perfect ending to this roaring sophomore album. <br /> <br />\\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is a great follow up to Simple Plan's break out album, \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\". With 11 catchy tracks from \\"Shut Up!\\" to \\"Untitled\\" this album will for sure bring Simple Plan even greater success and lead them flying high into 2005. I give Simple Plan's \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" a 4/5 star rating. Great job guys! <br /> <br />Written By: Jennifer Forrest <br /> <br />To find out more about Simple Plan visit: [...] today! <br />
B00005221M|2.0|I am going to go with the previous review made by \\"Book Lover\\" on this one.  We watched this movie in my English class Thursday, Monday, and today, and I was very disappointed with it because I'd previously read the book.  However, since I was the only one to have done so, the discussion when the movie was finished today was biased towards the film.  Even my teacher admitted to not having read the book, and so I was alone in my stand.  But apart from myself...there were severe contrasts between the book and the movie, enough to drive the literature lover insane.  Granted, the historical aspects of the film -- costumes, scenery, buildings/locations, etc. -- were very accurate, and the performances by the actors were excellent, and the soundtrack was beautiful...but refer to Book Lover's review, and you'll see what I mean.  It's not a bad movie.  It just has some major, major flaws.  James Fennimore Cooper deserved better.
B00063MBU8|5.0|From the band that brought you &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; comes Simple Plan's sophomore album, &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; This album has already brought Simple Plan great success, debuting on US and Japan charts at #3 and Canadian charts at #2! The first single off their sophomore album, &quot;Welcome To My Life&quot; has already proven to be a strong single. Rising quickly on the Much Music chart in Canada and reaching #1 on MTV's TRL. <br />&quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; brought you such smash singles as &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; and in my opinion &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; will bring many more chart topping singles. Starting with the first track off their second album, &quot;Shut Up!&quot; This song is catchy and upbeat not much unlike their hit from 2003 &quot;Addicted&quot;. Along with &quot;Shut Up!&quot; I believe that, &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Me Against The World&quot; will become great hits as well. <BR>&quot;Thank You&quot; is contradicting from a first read at the title. This song is about someone that had a friend that let them down and they're thanking them for showing them that not everyone, including best friends, can be trusted.

B000021XS0|5.0|This album blows you away the whole time.  Musicianship like none other, interesting story,a nd some of the best tunes you will ever hear. <br />I just cant even get into how technical all the albums this band does.... probably the most technically advanced band in the world. <br />This album makes me and every person who i have evr showed it to HAPPY as can be, so do yourself a favor be HAPPY! <br /> <br />Standout tracks:  Overture, Fatal Tragedy, Home, wait... what am i doing, all of them stand out!
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was disappointed in this third Harry Potter movie.  What bothered me most is that the kids were always in \\"muggle\\" clothes.  I like them better in their school robes and cloaks.  If I wanted to see kids in muggle clothes I can go to any mall on Saturday afternoon and there are thousands running around in them.  Unfortunately I did see a review and knew that the director was planning on them wearing their muggle clothes more and it may have drawn my attention to it more than it would have had I not heard about it before hand.  So, if this review did the same to someone else, I apologize.  I do plan on buying the movie anyway.  Maybe the next time I will be able to get past the clothes and just enjoy the movie.  Anyway, the books will always be so much better than the movies.
B000001E18|4.0|The title track has some of the most interesting guitar work the edge has ever done. <br /> <br />a very good song to listen to with headphones. <br /> <br />enjoy!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The bonus stripped CD was released this past july 04, so a year had passed since the original Chariot CD was released. The Chariot CD showcases Gavin as a soulful, rock musician (he plays both piano, sort of plays like billy joel, and guitar) who is very well aware of catchy pop hooks. I think he sounds similar to adam levine of maroon 5, where the soul funk is always couched in accessible pop tunes. <br />Gavin writes of love, crushes, longing and timing in relationships and self identity. He's not just another in the vein of sensitive singer songwriter, his music is quite extroverted and playful. Get this CD combo for a great music deal. you get 2 CD's for the price of one, and you can see the organic growth of entire album worth of songs
B000667GFK|5.0|I have to admit that I had to hear the album a couple of times before I realized how great it is.  Most of the songs have been performed by various artist before, so its hard to get used to a different version right away.  After hearing it a few times you start to enjoy and appreciate the quaility of this production.  It is much more than just another Mariachi cover album.  This production is great!  Luis Miguel as always sounds great and the music arrangements are very creative.  This  is another collection album such as the \\"Romances\\" albums and the songs are remakes, but Luis Miguel gives them the touch of class and makes them his own with his personal style and perfection. A keeper.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I must admit that I was impressed with the changes made to the original Special Edition (which I hated). <br /> <br />In this revamped version,  <br /> <br />- Greedo still gets a shot off at Han in the Cantina, but they shoot simultaneously (rather than Greedo shooting first and missing at point-blank range). <br /> <br />- Jabba meets Han in the Mos Eisley hangar bay, but the CGI is superior to the original SE (here, they used the CGI for him from Phantom Menace). Instead of yelping when Han steps on his tail, he growls and bristles while flexing his arms. Although, he still should have wiped the hangar bay with Han's @$$ IMO, the changes make him appear to be less of a wimp than what we saw in '97. <br /> <br />- The holographic meeting between Vader and Palpatine in Empire has been completely redone. The dialogue is much better than the original (which I always thought sounded lame and made the Emperor appear weaker than the character we see in Jedi). The holo-Palpatine was also given a make-over. This time, we see Darth Sidious' cowled visage from Episodes I and II instead of the bulging-eyesocket-almost-looks-alien crappy makeup job from the original film. <br /> <br />- Boba Fett's spoken lines are now voiced by the actor who played Jango Fett in AotC. <br /> <br />- Luke no longer yodels \\"AIEEEeeee!\\" as he falls to his supposed death from the Bespin platform following his duel with Vader. <br /> <br />- The CGI has been touched up in Jedi with Luke's scene with the Rancor. The \\"outlines\\" (between the beast's legs and hands) have been removed so that the Rancor scene is more believable. Also, a splash of sand goes up in the air as the monster's left hand collapses limply to the ground. <br /> <br />- The CGI yellow overlay over the Emperor's eyes was touched up so that only his pupils are yellowed (rather than the entire eye/jowl area). <br /> <br />- Hayden Christensen was CGI'd in as the spectral Anakin that Luke sees standing beside Obi-Wan and Yoda, whichfits as this younger Anakin is how he appeared prior to his fall to the Dark Side (in the latter half of Episode III). After he redeemed himself, it makes sense that THAT is how his 'residual self-image' (to borrow a phrase from The Matrix) would appear. <br /> <br />- the art from the original movie posters appears on each DVD respectively. <br /> <br />In fact, the only change that was leftover from the original SE that I dislike is when Luke remarks, \\"You're lucky you got out of there\\" when R2 is spit out of whatever swamp beastie that swallows him. In the original version of Empire, Luke says, \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good.\\" I thought that was much funnier than the line they went with in SE, but that's small enough to be overlooked in the grand scheme of things.
B0006284JQ|5.0|It's almost amazing to think that it has been 6 years since \\"..Baybe One More Time\\" hit shelves in 1998.  Since then, Mrs. Spears has released 4 multi-platinum albums, made over $100,000,000 in sales and become an icon that everyone around the world knows.  \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" is the perfect collectors cd for all of Spears fans.  It combines all of Spears singles (excluding \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\") in one cd that showcases how much she has affected the music business over the years.  \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" also brings Britney new greatest hit, \\"My Prerogative\\" and two unreleased tracks.  (I've Just Begun) Having My Fun, which was released earlier this year and became an instant hit, and \\"Do Somthin'\\", an electrifying tack that will have its followers reciting the lyrics over and over again. <br /> <br />I guess calling Britney an icon would be appropriate, as seeing that she has done some of the unthinkable over the past 6 years, changing her style, her attitude, and her sound, all which is displayed in \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Along wih this cd, you also get a cd full of remixes from Britneys biggest hits such as \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Baby One More Time\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is a cd that every Britney fan will want to have.  Its a cd that is putting Britneys greatest in the spotlight, and marking the end of her past, and the begining of her future as a mega star.
B0000CDWQ9|1.0|I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this.  The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each.  It's not a deal at all.  If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it.  Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these.  Why would I want more than one copy of a movie?
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is the best in the music country nobody it has arrived as far with music country as her, his new single Party For Two is excellent, all the songs of the Cd are art, clear the best are those that come from its Album Come on Over and Up! that they are very amusing, the best of all is From This Moment it is magic, good alone I hope  has good sales because this collection is very good and complete, all we should have it, the same as that of Robbie Williams.
0060989157|5.0|Love 'em or hate 'em, Motley Crue have endured quite a lot. I got the chance to see them live twice but only because Whitesnake '87 and Y & T were opening acts for them. I have to admit they put on a good show but I would never go see them without the strength of another band. So kind of consider me a fan because I love their debut \\"Too fast For Love\\" but then they went down hill from there. My friends recommended this book to me a year ago and I finally found a copy in a used book store at a price I could live with. I found myself remembering most of the popular events like Sixx's overdose death, Neil killing Razzle from Hanoi Rocks, US festival, Lee going to jail.  A great read but not because you like the subject matter, these guys could give a toss about anyone but themselves except for maybe Mick Mars. He sounds like a nice guy who deserved all the fame he received but thanks to his taste in women, lost most if not all of his money. The other guys are just pathetic. The guys have sex with various girlfriends of the guy who signed them basically right in front of him.  And could care less. Gratitude. And he says he doesn't care. When you see a picture of the guy you know why. I think.  They have sex with each other's girlfriend behind their back. They treat women like s**t. They treat everyone like s**t, but somehow rose to be great big stars. Read this to find or figure out how. I never had respect for these guys and now I only have less. Grown men who never grew up. And still haven't.  And don't care.  Unfortunately, I know a few guys like this, but they are dirt poor. Freud would have a field day with these idiots.  Sad part is they are heroes to a bunch of people.  Great writing style by Neil Strauss. You have trouble putting this down. This is a good book for the pool, beach, or ski vacation. WARNING: Don't expect to function normally after reading this. You won't!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I saw them for the first time in their video All The Things She Said the truth terrifies me, but later already you me toward normal to see two small lesbians, the truth still waits a second album although you that that is to dream, left me very initiate  wanted to listen but music of them but you already finishes this DUET so good, all the songs of the Cd are good, them and their producers made this material with much care made it perfect, Small the stranger! return.
B0000AM6JI|3.0|The scene in the begining is great. \\"Ok Im reloaded!\\". But there are just WAY TO MANY corny love scenes with bad music. Basically its all narrated by Carlito, he tells the story. Its a good movie but its just too drawn out and VERY boring most of the time. The movie is 143 minutes long. I would of cut alot of the scenes out. If your a Sean Penn fan, the Crime Drama \\"State of Grace\\" blows this movie away, there is NO comparison. Im a HUGE Al Pacino fan and yes his acting is superior in this or any of his films but as I said before it's just alot of boring scenes. (Yawn).
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I watched Van Helsing last night. I want my time back. It reminded me of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but different. Kind of like, Wolverine hunts LOEG. The only good part was the end battle between VH and Dracula. The soundtrack is pretty good though, but the movie actually gave me a headache, just like Team America did. <br />The mistake was trying to fit 3hrs of info into what I think was just under 2, then instead of condensing the script to give you the most story, the script was condensed to allow for the most visually lush and lavish scenes, and it never let up. Add to that the time inconsistencies (was night in a frame, woman steps forward, shot now from behind and it's daylight) to downright annoying acting (give me break on the friar).
B0006284JQ|5.0|Imigine Pop Culture without Britney Spears? That would be one boring world. I just got my copy of the limited edition Hits album, and OH MY GOD! ITS A TOTAL MUST HAVE! Listening to it in the car on the way home, made me realize how much Britney has contributed to the best music of our lifetime. I give it 10 stars if I could. Purchasing it was to me, like saying thankyou to Britney for the hard work, the dedication, and the entertainment over the last 6 years. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE how all of her dreams have come true, and now we can reflect back on her success with the Immiculate Collection of our Generation, our very own IDOL-STATIS Figure like her idol Madonna! I would like to dedicate this to Britney Federline, and thank you for the years. Now take time to make a family, enjoy your life, and celebrate your wildest dreams unfolding! We will be ready for your return. Please don't make us wait too long. LOVE YA!
B0002234LS|2.0|Did you like the movie 'Identity' where there is like one and half hours of an absolutely fantastic setup only to have John Cusack turn into Uncle Fester in the end? Well it seems that Hollywood has yet again decided that another run at this copout would be a good idea - great premise, excellent setup and throw in the old totally unrealistic psycho split-personality twist that the story is all in some sick persons head... hell even rip the ending of The Shining \\"Redrum\\" for good measure. Is that what you want after investing 90 minutes of your time? Do you really believe in the 21st century that people have this split-personality disorder? It is about as realistic as just throwing a three-eyed alien into the movie and saying that it was the cause of it all.<br /><br />It is true that Secret Window has an excellent premise - an author, going through a divorce, living out in the country, in the middle off writer's block, meets a stranger who claims that he stole his story and then the stranger proceeds to make the writer's life a misery by killing and harming everyone around him... all because the writer stole his story, a story that our protagonist claims he wrote himself. Interesting yes, but the fact that the ending is just so lame makes it all totally worthless, however this movie does have some good points in that the final last scene is not that bad, the dialogue is quite witty throughout and both lead actors - Depp and Turturro are on flying form... but all is marred by a rehash of the stupid ending we got in Identity. How they could do this once in the 21st century is incredible given that some young talented directors can hardly get a greenlight for their next ORIGINAL project. Doing it twice just shows how terrible the whole system is. Boycott this type of garbage and watch it when it comes to television. Everyone should have known better.
0446677450|3.0|... but most people doesn't born so. Most people, when looking at land, sea, a mountain, a lake or a building sees only the shape, colour, size... <br />But there exists between us a few people which don't see the same things as the majority of us or  at less  I think so. But don't forget, they are few. One of these rarely clever persons is Mr. Kiyosaki. His book doesn't contains complicate ideas. By the contrary, these are very easy to understand (to put in practice is another thing), but I believe he, when looking at a house or a terrain doesn't see nothing of the anterior qualities: instead he see dollars, or euros if you want, this is cash, and that is a talent that can be perfected if you have a natural ability for business, but not practicable with success by everybody. Mr. Kiyosaki has demonstrated how he's worth in making money between other facts in selling thousands of copies of this book, but how many people has attained to get rich after reading? I think very few.  <br />
0316168815|5.0|I am an avid reader, have read a lot of books and this is by far one of the best. I felt like I was pulled into the story and came to know the characters as if they were real people. I couldn't put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who has lost a loved one.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch has done it again.  I saw this movie 5X before I was able to make some kind of sense of it and I still watch it in awe.  That's the beauty of it.  Dreams, reality, what is real and what isn't and the fine line in between is what makes this movie worth watching.   <br /> <br />I like comedy as much as the next guy but how many apple pie movies and lampoon specials can you watch before getting sick all over yourself?  For crying out loud, challenge your brain for a change and watch this movie...several times.
0887306667|1.0|In The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Al Ries and Jack Trout attempt to provide the reader with a set of rules that should always produce the expected result in marketing. The authors ask, rhetorically, why highly paid marketers violate these rules and state that \\"billions of dollars have been wasted on marketing programs that couldn't possibly work, no matter how clever or brilliant.\\"  The implication is that this would not happen if these marketers would simply read this book. Unfortunately a number of the \\"laws\\" presented are simplistic, overstated, redundant and, in some cases, contradictory.<br /><br />The laws start out rather simply: Law 1 \\"It's better to be first than it is to be better.\\"  This one makes sense, yet it is not that groundbreaking. Obviously, being first to market is important, but the authors imply that if you are not first to market you should not get into the market at all.<br /><br />Law 2 \\"If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category.\\" Saying it differently, \\"If you can not be first to market, try a slightly different market.\\" This is still, in effect, being first to market.  This seems to be an example of the first law, all it is really saying is that it is important to be first to market.<br /><br />The first major contradiction comes in Law 7 \\"The Law of the Ladder\\" which has to do with how you operate depending on which position in your market you occupy. How can the authors offer a strategy to being in the second position in a market if Law 1 states that you never want to be in any position other than the first? Moving on to Law 9 \\"The Law of the Opposite: If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.\\" This law violates the first law, and also seems obvious.  When entering a market with a clear leader why would any marketer ignore what that company has done to become the leader?  Also in this law the authors state that \\"you should leverage the leader's strength into a weakness,\\" yet they do not explain how one would do this.<br /><br />Law 12, \\"The Law of Line Extension,\\" dictates that extending a brand past what is currently successful is foolish and will fail.  The authors state that this is one of the most violated laws, and they illustrate this with an interesting example.  The authors take aim at a software company which - in 1993 when the book was written-was just developing.  The authors fault the company for trying to acquire assets and software companies to try to compete against already entrenched software giants like Lotus, WordPerfect, and SPC Software.  They continue to detail how this company is setting itself up for failure by continuing to push for market leadership in all manner of software applications even though they do not currently lead in any.  The name of the company which the authors state \\"has ominous signs of softness in their strategy\\" is Microsoft.  Microsoft is the current leader in all markets the authors discuss.<br /><br />While there is some good information offered by Ries and Trout, none of it is all that impressive or insightful.  There are a number of contradictions in the laws themselves which seem to make the laws more like easily bendable rules than anything concrete.  The suggestions offered are often so vague that it seems like the authors are simply saying \\"just market better,\\" which is rarely helpful.  The examples used are repetitive and often lead to predictions that must embarrass the authors now.  The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing does not offer a vastly different perspective on marketing from what most would consider common sense, and the examples fail to be useful.y do not explain how one would do this.<br /><br />Law 12, \\"The Law of Line Extension,\\" dictates that extending a brand past what is currently successful is foolish and will fail.

B00005JKGV|5.0|As with all of Lynch's movie's, the viewer is allowed to think instead of being spoon-fed the story.  With Lynch's LOST HIGHWAY we are finally able to try to decipher a movie without drooling all over ourselves.  Many different interpretations abound about the meaning of this movie and isn't THAT what it's all about?  Talking and discussing great cinema?  Rather than \\"yeah, it was good.\\"  People have become so lazy in this modern technological age that the mere idea of thought is devastating to the psyche.  Lynch continues his pursuit of art in motion and successfully achieves one of his greatest masterpieces.
0393035158|5.0|If our culture were a Monopoly game, religions are free to Pass Go and Collect their $200 of public subsidies (no property taxes and police and fire services \\"on the house\\").  They are also granted, it seems, a card that reads \\"complete exemption from critical evaluation.\\" <br /> <br />Enter Sam Harris.  His End of Faith drops onto the game board, causing the little plastic churches, temples, and mosques to topple over, if temporarily.  Though not flawless, the book boldly and intelligently ventures into a topic others have merely tip-toed around. <br /> <br />The first 50 pages of The End of Faith hit me like a double espresso.  The next 100 had my mind percolating with questions.  Not surprisingly, the book was unable maintain the high quality of discourse throughout.  The final third, in my opinion, ventures somewhat off track.  But those first few dozen pages alone make it well worth cracking open.  I strongly recommend it. <br /> <br />
B00003CX5P|1.0|This film totally ruined the original 3 movies for me.  At this point, I recommend reading the DUNE series by Frank Herbert, the original idea behind STAR WARS.  A lot more complex and cerebral but I'm sure all those STAR WARS fans can handle a little thought.  Right.

B00005JMXX|5.0|I gotta admit. I've seldom laughed as hard at a movie. Sure, it wasn't as unintentionally funny as \\"Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever\\" or \\"Swimfan\\", still I found it quite laugh out loud amusing. A worthy addition for anyone's MST3K collection. <br /> <br />From the junk science to the sophomoric political propaganda (Note: the Kyoto Accords will have no net effect on any global warming trend) this movie is a nonstop laugh riot. I can't think of a movie with such cheesy dialogue even surpassing \\"Independence Day\\".  <br /> <br />Here are a few of the greatest rib-splitting scenes: <br /> <br />Vice President Dick Cheney... er, I mean Becker... is depicted as evil because he won't order a complete disruption of US society based on the assertions of two climatologists. <br /> <br />Later Cheney... er, I mean Becker, orders the National Guard to evacuate the entire southern half of the United States. Yeah, that's a good one. <br /> <br />Randy Quaid risks his life to save three ice core samples, jumping a huge ice rift. <br /> <br />Randy Quaid decides to travel from WashDC to New York to look for his son.

Heeheeheehee. <br /> <br />I highly recommend TDAT as a prime example of how incredibly stupid and lost in Lala-land Roland Emmerich has become. Even Ed Wood's schlocky movies show more thought (and respect for the audience) than this gobbler. <br /> <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|This is the best of Green Day!  They have never been more fabulous.  I have followed GD since 1994 loving their style and talent.  I listened to the CD all the way through without skipping a song.  The style is original, yet GD!  Buy this CD!  You will love it.  Listen closely to the meaningful lyrics.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Nevermind whether this is or isn't a \\"rock opera,\\" American Idiot is full of the energy and conviction that would have made it a hit even back in the punk/new wave days of the early 80's (and that's a compliment).  Great guitars, great vocals from Billie Joe, and tight ensemble playing make this one a must-hear. Extraordinary Girl is a bit weak, as is the closing Whatsername (I would have liked to see a more powerful ending to this CD), but the rest is pure postpunk joy.  Here's hoping GD continues to get better!
B000059MEK|5.0|I dont know what was going through DAFT PUNK's head when they came out with this... this is just genious!!! this LP is one of my favourite 10 albums of all time (#4) this album has everything: r&b, techno, rave, electronica, house, pop, and classical.   <br /> <br />my favourite tracks on the album that i cannot choose which one is better is 'harder better faster stronger' and 'superheros' these songs are great dance songs.... they are my favourite dance songs ever.  i love 'superheros' because the further the song the more they add to the music (different beats that go together which makes me mindboggled each time i hear it).  'harder...' is just brilliant... period. <br /> <br />'face 2 face' 'something about u' 'cresendolls' 'digital love' 'aerodynamik', and 'one more time' just changed the game in dance musik... <br /> <br />and i just love the videos for the first 4 singles on the LP... the japanese animation videos were amazing... <br /> <br />i have never ever ever heard an album like this in my lifetime... this album is just way more than excellent....  <br /> <br />on a scale of 0-100... this album is in the millions.... <br />100,000,000 stars <br />
B000053VAF|4.0|Dogma is probably what one would get if they drank too much communion wine.  In other words, a really interesting view of religion.  Unique enough that some would say this makes religion look bad, but I think that the satirical nature of the film reveals more about ourselves then one might think at first glance, especially if they brushed it off for rubbish. <br />    <br />   The plot is about how Catholic dogma has caused a loophole in the system, thus allowing two fallen angels to possibly get back to heaven.  However, the side of good has their own hero found in an abortion clinic worker, who blames God for her own personal failings at a successful marriage.  In addition, with the sometimes obnoxious Jay and Silent Bob (whose mostly just silent,) and comedian Chris Rock this movie definitely has it's humor. <br />     <br />   This movie is crude on language, but the message is enjoyable and rather original.  Kevin Smith has an interesting way of making seriousness go funny and then back to seriousness, and he has done it once again.  This movie may not be for everyone, but give it a shot, for it is rather enjoyable. <br />
B00005JMXX|2.0|This film is to the United States as Godzilla is to Japan. That the same director who directed the Americanized version of Godzilla directed this film should be of little wonder. Just as Godzilla was a metaphor for Japan's destruction, so is global warming a metaphor for the excesses of the United States. We waste the world's resources like no other country or region on Earth, and the vast majority of us just don't care.  <br /> <br />So there's an intelligent metaphor at work. Sadly, there isn't anything unique about the plot. All of the characters are cardboard cutouts; standard stereotypes with no will or minds of their own. There are scenes stolen directly from Titanic. The only redeeming thing about the film is the special effects, which are extraordinary, but special effects do not a movie make. It would be like judging the quality of a children's picture book solely by the quality of the artwork. And that, I fear, is an apt simile for this movie. <br /> <br />If you don't care about the originality or unique content of a story, and special effects are really the only reason you see movies, you may like this. There's a caveat to that, though. Once the special effects of the massive storm end, the film comes to a halt like a sprinter running into a wall. Everything just STOPS. <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|With the exception of the few new songs on this album, every person every where on this planet has heard the other tracks.  Britney Spears has permeated this planet to a degree that few musical acts are ever able.  Is this good?  Is this bad?  Is this sick?  Probably all of the above, but with this greatest hits CD, we finally don't have to carry around 4 different Britney CDs in our cars just to hear her singles. <br /> <br />Brit's cover of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\" is nothing exceptional.  I'm certain she only covered it because of whatever whacked out mindset she's been in lately that makes her think other people are trying to hold her back.  The reason to buy this disc is not for the new songs, it's for the old favorites.  The majority of individuals who purchase this album probably already own the other CDs, but hey, there's new pictures!   <br /> <br />Anyway, this disc was inevitable, but it's worth the money if you want to blow some cash on stupid songs that are nonetheless fun to listen to.  The girl may be losing it in a big way, but at least we can still have fun to the music we've enjoyed since 1998.
B00030590I|5.0|The cinematography is amazing!  I loved Raise the Red Lantern.  How brilliant, sensual, fantastical and wonderful the movie is, yet, it all distills to one theme...which you'll have to find out in the end.  <br /> <br />The brilliance of the colors and the stunning canvas is far more captivating than the action in the story itself.  Definitely worth watching.
0380002930|5.0|I've recently started re-reading this book as a Sophomore in college and I find that the immeasurable shear enjoyment of it has not deteriorated the slightest bit since probably six years ago when I first experienced Watership Down.  This is a truly amazing book, gripping story, characters that are heroic to Herculean hights, cunning equal to Odysseus, and overall pervaded by a joyful warm spirit only to be found in equally great works such as Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death. <br /> <br />However, I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ. <br /> <br />I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used. <br /> <br />All in all, the film deserves some sort of oscar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002KD9|5.0|In terms of melody and mood, this is by far Neil's best album. The tunes are haunting, and the way the rhythm and guitar work together gives you the sense that all your cares are being ironed out. <br />If you fault Neil's singing on this album, you aren't a true Neil Young fan. Neil isn't a pretty singer like David Cassidy. He's not a finesse artist who wants to wrap up his music in a nice shiny package. What you can hear in Neil's voice is a real person trying to convey feeling through lyrics and melody. There are plenty of singers who have a better voice, but few with Neil's depth of feeling. Another hallmark of his music is his way of letting a guitar solo take the place of a voice to convey a melody that says more than words can say. <br />Neil really hits his stride with \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" and \\"I Believe in You.\\" His \\"Birds\\" calls to mind \\"Expecting to Fly\\"--as if they were parts of the same meditation on loss. <br />This album should be a staple in your Neil Young collection. <br />
B0000009SE|5.0|I am listening to this CD as I write this review. I bought this CD when it first came out. I have lost count how many times I have played it. I never get tired of hearing this brilliant album. I have almost all of Zappa's CD's and this one together with \\"Hot Rats\\" and \\"Grand Wazoo\\" are my absolute favourites because he has allowed himself to concentrate on producing serious progressive music rather than his more comic and bizzare CD's. Don't get me wrong - I like almost all of Zappa's music - it is just that the above mentioned CD's really show us the genious that was Zappa. Like most of the other reviewers I agree with them that \\"Big Swifty\\" and \\"Waka Jawaka\\" are the most incredible tracks on the CD. I wont bother describing these  tracks because words fail me. Let me say though, that I have lost count of the number of times on a Sunday afternoons I have cranked up the volume in my lounge room and have imitated all the instruments in the songs going from guitar to horn to trumpet and back again. I loose myself in his music. If you are a fan of creative, progressive, jazzy music then buy this CD - now!
B00062J00S|5.0|While I think that \\"Schindler's List\\" is the BEST movie I've ever seen, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is my FAVORITE one.  If you have any heart, you'll become attached to this movie and feel wonderful after watching it.  You can't go through Christmas season without watching this at least once!
B000003S0I|5.0|I have all of King Crimson's CD's (except for some bootlegs). In my opinion King Crimson were at their peak from 1971 to about 1974. \\"Larks Tongues \\" is on top of my list followed by the other great albums \\"Lizard\\", \\"Red\\", \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" and \\"Islands\\". I am incapable of describing  \\"larks tongues\\" - words fail me. All I can say is that I put my headphones on, lay on the sofa and float away in another world. The CD is a mixture of gentle progressions/agressive pounding and everything in between. What I particularly love is the variety of instruments used eg violins, violas, mellotron and what sounds like drunk trumpets. The music tends to build up from a combination of fragmented noises moving slowly to a recoginsable rythm and finally to a shattering climax. I can't pick my favourite track - they are all excellent. If I had to I guess I would pick \\"Talking Drum\\" for it's progressive rythm accompanied by haunting violin. Buy this CD!
0440237688|3.0|This book was ok. The ending was rather lackluster and left many questions unanswered. The overall book was interesting and makes you think about how life could be in a Utopian society. Many problems of the world are resolved in this book but the people are practically brainwashed. This book would be a good intro into other Utopian books. It's not my favorite book but it's good.
B000002KXO|5.0|This needs some treble in it and the volume is so low that it sounds muddy and never grabs your attention! <br /> <br />Come on Warner Brothers -- shine up this dusty classic!
B000001FKY|5.0|A consistently melodic, fun, and extremely listenable album - even now 15 years after I first heard it.  I can't say that about most of the music from that time period.  \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Pour Some...\\" are the tracks I (probably most) started listening to and then I gradually accepted the whole album into my regular 'playlist.'  \\"Rocket\\" is especially fun to blast on warm summer afternoons. <br />The whole album is excellent.  Enjoy.
B000001F9E|5.0|The most sucessful studio album by Thin Lizzy. <br /> <br />Some points on Thin Lizzy <br /> <br />As a band it takes some listening to the band to get into them mainly due to the Weird style of singing by Phil and the rhymes which at times seem out of tune. <br /> <br />In fact once you get into the band the thing that were tough to digest infact are the endearing parts of the bands unique music. <br /> <br />Nearly all early albums of the band have a heady mix of hard riff based rockers and beautiful barritone love ballads (with the sweetest of lyrics). <br /> <br />The Band consists of : <br /> <br />Phil Lynot on Vocals / Bass Leader  <br />Grahom Scott and Brian Robertson on Guitar <br />Brain Downey on Drums <br /> <br />The Peak of the band starts from 'Jailbreak' in '75/'76 and continues to 'Black Rose' in '80 their 4th release. after 'Jailbreak'   <br /> <br />On Jailbreak <br /> <br />This is my favorite album as it contains two great rockers in the title song and 'The boys are back in town' both hard rockers with great guitar work duels between Groham and Robertson. <br /> <br />The mellower ' Angel from the coast' and 'Worrior' are also  great. <br /> <br />My favorites on the album are the ballads 'Romeo and the lonely girl' and the amazing 'Fight or Fall' both these numbers showcase the ability of Phil to compose and write soft songs and give a kind feeling to the vocals that somehow make these songs immortal. <br /> <br />Another famous song by the band is 'Cowboy song' which has influenced the basis of the band 'Bon Jovi. Metallica is another band influenced by Lizzy though the music styles between the two is very different. <br /> <br />It is sad that great Bands like 'Lizzy', 'Uriah Heep' are fading from the memory of the current generation of rock listeners as they are as good in their own way to the bigger bands of their generation like 'Led Zepppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Pink floyd'.
B0002858YS|5.0|Finally, a new band to be proud of! For years I've been yearning for a band that gives me something new and fresh while still maintaining a heavy \\"throwback\\" sound...I found that band. From the moment \\"Jenny was a Friend\\" begins (and you can't tell me that the bass line in this song isn't right out of the Duran Duran playbook!)hits, you know you are in for a new experience. This band embodies all that is new, and all that is loved about the past at the same time. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is 100% 80's and 100% infectious What truly sets this band apart is the fact that the \\"non radio\\" songs hold up just as well as the pop hits. Overall,this is an unbelievable debut from a band I can only hope will keep it up!!!
B000062YB1|5.0|The question of which Slayer album is the best, this one or Reign in Blood, is the cause of much debate. Usually, Reign in Blood shades it and I must agree there but at the end of the day the debate is irrelevant. If you're a fan of metal you NEED to own both albums. <br />The sound on Seasons is best described as a mix of South of Heaven and Reign in Blood. There is a return to thrashier material but it never rivals the breakneck speed of RiB. There are some excellent mid paced riffs on this album though; the one in \\"Skeletons of Society\\" is awesome.  <br />Take this as a criticism if you like, but the album isn't as \\"evil sounding\\" as the two that preceeded it. Apart from the spooky \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" and the beginning of the title track, the album is more agressive than dark. Which is perhaps a result of Slayer almost completely abandoning Satanic imagery in favour of songs about war, opression and serial killers. <br />The album follows the tradition of the past two albums with the best songs at the beggining, middle and then the end; \\"War Ensemble\\", \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" and the title track all being exceptionally strong. <br />An essential purchase for metal fans and a very good introduction to Slayer. <br />
B0006284JQ|4.0|For pure classic pop music, you can't go wrong with Britney.  Since 1999, Britney has put out a number of memorable pop singles.  Last year's 'Toxic' was her pinnacle and I don't know if she will be able to top that one.  She certainly doesn't with her latest single, her cover of Bobby Brown's 'My Perogative', which lacks any real joy.  It's rather dull and Britney sounds so serious, that it's only a lost cause.  But there are plenty of hits here:  'I'm a Slave 4 U', '...Oops, I Did It Again', 'Boys', 'Lucky' and '...Baby One More Time'.  There is also a bonus CD featuring remixes and a megamix.  This is definitely a great party record.  Britney may not be a great singer, and she is no Madonna either, but give her credit, she and her producers have made some great ear candy.  This album makes a strong case for that.
B000268QB2|3.0|I've been browsing foreign sites for a while now, always scouting for new bands to listen to and a while back bought a compilation disk from one such site that featured the nominees for the 2004 Mercury Prize for album of the year.  Keane was one of the bands on that disk and I instantly liked their sound and bought the cd as an import because it was unavailable in the US.  Then I heard one of their songs was being used on a TV show and the disk was being promoted for sale in the US so I decided to check it out and, although the price is right, was not surprised to discover the American version is different than the UK version which I own.  I thought I'd let prospective buyers know that.  The cover colors are reversed and there's a track missing on this version and I can't figure out why it was dumped.  Overall, the cd is great.  This reinforces my opinion that there is still good music out there, you just have to find it.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Name 5 Icons of the Music industry....Elvis, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Aretha Franklin, and Madonna. It may be arguable, that Madonna is comparable to those Musical Giants in their musical talent, lets face she herself said she never went into this industry because she thought she could sing. She is however everlasting and consistent in the fact that shes always bringing fresh new material to her fans, something all those artists accomplished until their appeal dwindled or tragic death stole our icons. She is the Queen Of Pop. This Album proves that. Great Songs abundunt, i still feel that more could have been added...American Pie, You'll See, I'll Remmeber, etc.  <br /> <br /> <br />What we are all really waiting for is a BOX SET!!! And please include all songs mentioned above, and Dress You Up, Angel, and many others left behind....Please. Thank You. <br /> <br />Oh, and yes, this Album is a must for all Fans of Madonna, and anyone who is interested in finding out what this artist has to offer....one hell of a Class Act.
0688152023|5.0|If you are looking for an intense workout, this is not for you.  This book is great way to tone your body without being too harsh.  I may not have broken a sweat during my workout, but I still feel well exercised and toned.
0312995423|1.0|This book was published about 8 months after the Da Vinci Code. It feels as if Dan Brown just slapped it together in a couple of weeks to be able to release it as soon as possible when the Da Vinci Code became so successful.  The writing is awful - primitive, bland, full of terrible cliches - and the plot is ridiculous and full of holes.  One can really tell that no research went into this book at all (and not much thinking, either).  Also, what really annoyed me was that for the first half of the book, the heroine is smart, and then suddenly, she becomes a complete idiot so that the boring plot can progress.  It's really a terrible effort, if I can even call it effort, on Mr. Brown's part.  Any real writer would not just try to put something out there on the market, no matter how crappy it is, just to make money - he would want to be proud of his work.  Please do yourself a favor and read \\"Ender's Game\\" or some other such book instead.  I was on the airplane with nothing to do, but this book only frustrated instead of entertained me.
0800177363|4.0|Awakening is a true story directed by Penny Marshall. It is a movie about people without hope, suffering from encephalitis.  The movie starts and ends in Bronx, New York in 1969. Robin William plays the challenging role of a doctor who is expected to look after the affected patients, without an aim of making them get better. Against the will of his superiors, he tries a medicine originally meant for patients suffering with Parkinson's disease on one of his patients Leonard (Robert de Niro). After achieving an unexpected success on Leonard, he tries the same medicines on all the patients. There was a miracle as it worked out on everyone, and they start living a normal life, but after some time it starts showing its side effects on Leonard. This part in the movie was really very depressing, because it again took him back to that pitiable state, same as earlier, but the saddest part was that all other patients knew that they all will face the same situation after some time and the same thing happened to them. <br />This movie was great but at the same time very depressing. Robin Williams and Robert de Niro play very impressive roles. One should definitely see this amazing movie. <br />
B000003TA4|3.0|This album overated enormously, sure \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" <br />and \\"Come As You Are\\" and the others are great songs, but as an album it is pretty rubbish, and Nirvana is really overated. <br /> <br />However \\"Nirvana Unplugged\\" in my opinion is underated, if you have'nt heard the Nirvana Unplugged album. your missing out on alot. <br /> <br />Sixteen Stone by Bush is a much better album, get that.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary presents a chilling account of the horrors of war (WWII and Vietnam) and a superb insight into the lessons learned from these wars. It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes. With nukes scattered across the globe, our learning-from-mistakes curve has been reduced to a single dot; make a mistake and you won't live to learn from it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is evolving and maturing which isn't a bad thing of course. Their style has become a bit heavier and more serious than that of their first c.d., ''No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.'' One of the best songs on this c.d. is ''Untitled.'' It's sad and beautiful and the phenomenal piano arrangements matched the song's circumstances perfectly. Songs like ''Shut Up'' and ''Me Against the World'' are in-your-face and mouth-offs to all the Simple Plan haters out there. I love how S.P. reacts positively to haters through their music rather than cursing them out directly (good for them!!!). ''Everytime'' and ''Promise'' are sweet love songs and the string arrangements in ''One'' are  absolutley impressive (and quite unexpected). Overall, ''Still Not Getting Any...'' is a great album and I can't help but wonder if S.P. haters are judging the band on their music rather than image and if they actually listened to the whole c.d. before and after they submitted reviews. Anyway, Canadians are cool (GO QUEBEC!!!).
0061015725|2.0|This is my first MC book.  I read it because it was mentioned in an article regarding nanotechnology and the battle over its future.  I bought it from a bargain bin for 3.99 <br /> <br />First, MC pushes the concept of threatening nanotechnology to a pretty ridiculous, farfetched conclusion.  I won't give anything away  but suffice it to say that reasonable suspension of disbelief goes out the window in the last 20 pages. <br /> <br />Second, the dialog is awful, as are the characterizations. <br />The collection of stereotypes having stereotypical reactions/conversations physically hurt me.  I wonder if he wrote it with a straight to screenplay in mind. <br /> <br />Anyways, a easy 6 hour read out of the bargain bin-- but not worth much more.
0385512104|5.0|I thought this would be a nice little murder mystery solved by a little boy. What I got was a rare glimpse into the mind of an autistic boy named \\"Christopher\\".  Mr. Haddon gives a great narrative through the eyes of a person who does not process thoughts the way most people would. I must say that it's not what I bargained for yet I found myself pretty enamored with this story of this little boy. As the plot unfolds, there were points when I had to try and get through Christopher's warped psych without feeling the same frustration his parents felt through out the story. I just wanted to yell at him for not doing what all of us would do in certain situations. I also have a whole lot of admiration for anyone with the patients to deal with someone like this. I must say that I'm very impressed with this angle of putting the reader in the mind of someone who's quite gifted yet lacking in simple everyday common sense. I trust the author's impression because he actually taught autistic children and possesses first hand knowledge of this very human problem. The story is peppered with instances of genuine concern for the main character as he is prone to getting himself in predicaments. All in all this is a wonderfully told story and yet it's not what you're going to expect. Have fun with this one and don't take it too seriously.
B00028FDRA|3.0|Lacuna Coil's 3rd and best-selling album, 2002's Comalies, refines the bands sound from the previous release Unleashed Memories, adds heavier riffs with more accessible choruses, deletes the use of guitar solos, and has spawned two successful radio singles.  <br /> <br />This is what happens when bands get popular, I'm sorry to say.  The music changes for the worse. As I said, the absence of guitar solos is a big no-no, and causes some of the songs to sound bland. Cristina's vocals are still there, but do not capture the same effect as the previous album, which was significantly better in terms of instrumentalism and songwriting as well. The bass is easily obscured, and the drumming is slow and boring. Any of the progressive elements of the last two records have been thrown out, and the music has become rather predictable. There you have it, the negative. <br /> <br />Now on to the positive. The album does provide a change from the previous material. Not necessarily a good change, as I (and probably others who enjoyed Unleashed Memories and In A Reverie) may have grown accustomed to their old signature sound, but a change nonetheless. I must also mention the improvement of male vocalist Andrea Ferro, who, yes, is still annoying, but still sounds a hell of a lot better. Most importantly however, I find the album's accessability suitable to those who are unfamiliar with the gothic metal scene, but want to learn the basics before they progress into bigger and better things. <br /> <br />Now, am I saying Comalies is bad? No. Three stars is not bad in my book (actually my original review of this album was a full 5-star). Hell, this band rocked the stage at Ozzfest (they are much better live than on disc). All I am implying is that there are other lesser-known bands that have been around longer and have done better musically. I personally prefer the intricacy and beauty of After Forever and Within Temptation, the orchestral accompaniment and progression of Lacrimosa, andthe experimentation of the Gathering and Nightwish. This is an opinion from someone who has familiarized himself with a numerous amount of gothic metal bands (it's my favorite genre if you didn't know) and whose tastes have evolved dramatically over the years.  <br /> <br />So, as I said, this is a good start into the gothic metal genre. If you were to get one Lacuna Coil album though, I would highly recommend Unleashed Memories over this, as it reaches emotions not capable on Comalies (this is no exaggeration).  <br /> <br />However, no CD has moved me quite like Within Temptation's (dare I say) perfect Mother Earth, and probably never will.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This 2 disc infini-film edition is how all dvd's should be released, on one disc you have the film in it's widescreen format with all of the special features and on the other disc the film is presented in full screen format also with all of the special features. <br /> Elf is not one of those \\"fly by night\\" comedies that will be funny and popular for just a couple of months, it is actually a really good christmas movie that will be around for years to come. <br /> The movie doesn't try too hard and Will Farrell plays the impish elf/human to perfection, providing tons of laughs that the whole family can enjoy.
B0006284JQ|5.0|In late 1998, the world was captivated by the sixteen-year-old \\"...Baby One More Time\\" songstress - but few predicted anything would come past Britney's debut #1 album by the same title. With four #1 proper studio albums under her belt, Britney Spears has proven she has what it takes to be the new Madonna.  <br /> <br />\\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" features 17 songs, 14 of them being the songs that have gotten her to where she is now. The other three, \\"My Prerogative,\\" \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun),\\" and \\"Do Somethin',\\" all have the makings of successful singles to further this pop queen's career. <br /> <br />Overall, a stellar hits album.
B000667GFK|4.0|I'm amazed at how \\"el sol\\" can still sing his heart out in every single song in the album! Being his first mariachi album, it came out as everyone expected it...EXCELLENT. \\"Entrega Total\\", \\"Un mundo raro\\", \\"Cielo Rojo\\" being my personal favs! Way to go LM!
B000002U82|5.0|I know mostly my reviews have been on most hardcore bands, but I want to give credit to bands outside that area. Pink Floyd is an awsome band, set the bar higher for rock music from the late 60's to the early 90's. This album is awsome, along with Off The Wall, both albums show pink floyd's amazing potential to make and play music.This is a must have for rock fans everywhere
068987474X|4.0|I have heard about this book everywhere. Oprah has had it and Sex and the City has featured an episode about it. My friends and I have a new outlook on guys. We are not going to waste our time doing all the work any longer. I don't even want a boyfriend so why would I want to find a guy? But, that is where the hard part comes in because there is already another guy. Now I know that I can't ask him out. According to the book, no female is allowed to do the asking.  <br /> I don't understand how ALL guys are this way. There has to be some exception to the rules. I am in college now and the guys around me are still immature in some ways. There is no point in trying to find a guy who is boyfriend worthy right now. As I stated before, I don't even want one so I should have no problem. The book is great though. Maybe the rules just seem too simple. We want to analyze everything and have answers for everything. We need to just sit back and be pursued! Our lives are busy enough already. There are better things to worry about than finding a guy who is worthy of our attention. I am not going to wait for a guy to call me when I could be out with my girls and having a blast with them. This book is great and has shined some light in the dark room! I love it!  <br />
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was unable to travel to Texas earlier this year in order to see this concert live, so when I heard that there would be a DVD I jumped on my chance to preorder it. I recieved the DVD and popped it into the player. I was simply amazed. This DVD is a must for anyone who enjoys music. Every guitar legend in one place, at one time.  Must buy.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Buy this.  The Special Collector's Edition has two discs, one disc with the film and the commentary audio track and the second disc with the amazing documentaries, location gallery, production gallery, cast profiles and tons of other extras.<br /><br />The movie is perfect, with a great cast.  Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are just some of the major stars in this production. Henry playing Frank the murderous gunslinger, Jason Robards the half-breed gunslinger, Claudia as the sexy Jill (and she is still sexy now) and Charles are the man who also has no name.<br /><br />The commentary gives us lots of information on the casting, soundtracks, behind-the-scene stories and lots of insight that just helps bring it all together.
B00009W0U4|4.0|The extended rape scene, were it a film of an actual rape, would of course be sickening and depraved. However, as a staged depiction of such, I found it incredibly arousing. I marvelled at the power and violence of the [...] sex. The fact is, I became VERY aroused watching it. The realism of the performances, coupled with the location and the camera being let to sit on the ground and record the images, were executed to perfection. I enjoyed the domination, the power, the raw energy of the scene. It was amazing. I wish I could have been on the set to watch it, to hear Monica Belluci's cries and screams. I know this sounds sick, but there are many men who secretly feel the same way. There's no doubt in company, or in public, protests would be made to the contrary. But this scene speaks to a deep, dark, primitive drive in the male sexual psyche. It touches the soul of any man who views it. It did mine. What WAS sickening to me was what the rapist did to her immediately after he had finished the sex rape, which I will not describe here. THAT was sick. This is a film with so many disturbing images, they stay in your mind long after watching it. If any film can affect you in a deep, visceral way, then it is a success.

0446310786|1.0|In 1960 Harper Lee published To Kill A Mockingbird. About thrity years earlier William Faulkner had published the short story Dry September. ITS THE SAME STORY. To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad book, its just simply not original (I won't say plagairized because I'm not sure that it is). Read Faulkner, particularly the short stories Dry Semptember, Barn Burning, and That Evening Sun Go Down and the novels Santuary, Light In August, and The Sound and The Fury. You get a much better look at the same time, place, and issues that Lee looks at, but you get it from the original source who happens to have been a much better writer.
B0002EXFNI|5.0|When I first started wathcing The Girl Next Door next door I didn't really know what to expect. I asked myself Philip your a baller just sit back and enjoy. So, I did and once I literally saw the girl next door I immediately started to enjoy it. But the thing that really stole it for me was Sam Yung. I love that little guy, and I'm gonna bang him, hard. The story is about a smart high school senior who is caught up in the fast spinning life of his partying school. He is talking to one of his friends on the phone when he spots a very pretty girl next door undressing. She spots him and comes over to his house. He expects that she will tell his parents that he was spying on her, but instead she takes him on a drive and makes him strip. Matthew, out main character, starts to fall in love with this girl as they spend more and more time together. She brings out the craziness in him that he has never experienced. Later on though his porn loving friend finds out that she is a porn star and shows Matthew. Matthew and Danielle, his woman, start to go through some rough patches and well she tries to shed her pornstar image. I think we all know whats best about this movie, SAM YUNG!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|A couple of reviewers here have trashed this DVD set because Led Zeppelin and Rick Springfield aren't on it. The reason Led Zeppelin weren't included on this set was because they didn't want to be included.  From a BBC news report dated August 4:  A statement from the members said: \\"Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones are in absolute full support of the fundraising project for the people of Sudan. However, Jimmy, Robert and John Paul found that both the sound and general reproduction of their performance at Live Aid Philadelphia was substandard.\\"  As for Rick Springfield, one of his songs is included among the extras.  Virtually every act had some songs cut on the DVD, with the exception I think of Queen, who thankfully have their entire set included (if memory serves, there were six songs in their set).  I would have liked every song presented that day from every band, live or via video, to be on this set but I guess an extra disc or two might have made it more expensive, thus inaccessible to less affluent people.  But one can look at the tracklistings and extras at liveaiddvd.net and they'll see that there is still a wealth of good stuff in this compilation!  Really, most of the bands and songs are on the DVD!  And come on people, the proceeds from this set are going to a good cause.  Spread a little Christmas cheer this year for yourselves and for others and get into the spirit of this unforgettable, amazing  event!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I have been waiting for over a year for this to come out on DVD and my wait is over It will be out Nov 16 th. This is the Funniest and most enjoyable movie I have ever seen. It is the perfect holiday movie!!! Will Ferell performance as an elf who finds out he's adopted is funny words don't miss it.
B000001DYD|5.0|I admit it, I couldn't stand PJ Harvey at first. I thought her voice was horrible and her music was just deafening garbage.  <br /> <br />This was before I realized how much I needed the voice and words of PJ Harvey. I didn't start off my collection with \\"Rid of Me\\", but this was most definitely the album that averted my idea on this amazing woman. Although noisy and unsettling, \\"Rid of Me\\" is an album of reality where relationships self-destruct and life is just plain sad. Many times, Harvey is singing about another character. But she easily possesses these characters as if they were her own. <br /> <br />\\"Rid of Me\\" is a masterpiece, even though it sounds at first like a horrid batch of loud noise. All you need to do is dig a little deeper, take some Advil, and experience this album that was born way before its time.  <br /> <br />I, for one, am a major PJ Harvey fan now, and would recommend ALL of her albums to anyone. Funny how things can change if you just open your mind.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This is the film that laid the groundwork for director Sergio Leone's masterpiece, \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\".  Leone was a genius in the sense that he did not so much evoke the West but he reimagined it with a European's sensibility.  In doing so he placed himself on the same pedestal as his idols John Ford and Howard Hawks.  His storytelling here is great.  The acting, with the possible exception of star Clint Eastwood, who legend has it was growing tired of \\"spaghetti westerns\\" and wanted to return Stateside, is stellar.  Lee Van Cleef is memorably cold-hearted and evil as Angel-Eyes.  The real star is Eli Wallach as Tucco.  Though the film designates him as \\"the Ugly\\", Tucco is the character we can most relate to.  Yes, he's done many bad things.  There are two scenes here that elicit empathy for Tucco.  One, where Tucco attempts to embrace his brother, a priest, and is subsequently rebuffed.  The other, where he is frantically racing through the endless cemetery for the buried gold.  It does not so much elicit sympathy for him, but you can feel the pathos.  Recently, a commercial TV station was showing \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" in a two hour time slot.  They cut the cemetery scene out completely.  That's like showing \\"Citizen Kane\\" without revealing what Rosebud is.  Needless to say, Ennio Morricone delivers another classic score here.  I didn't find critic Richard Schickel's commentary on the DVD as being very informative;more like tedious.  The deleted scenes didn't add much to the film's narrative.  Nor were the documentaries much to write home about.  The theatre cards included in the package were pretty cool though.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is extremely good! I've had it for over two weeks and am still listening to the whole thing every day! Its pretty different from Simple Plans first album but in a good, improved way. I found that i can relate to almost all of their songs and im sure many other people can too. Not only are the lyrics brilliant but the music is great to listen to as well. I love the guitar on alot of the songs like Welcome to my life and Perfect World.  and who couldnt love the wonderful vioce of lead singer pierre bouvier?!?! :) overall, this CD is a definite must have and if you dont have it now, GO BUY IT! the DVD is also great. ive watched it like every day. its so funny and really entertaining. if you dont like simple plan, watch the dvd and then you will like them... its great. Favorite songs on the album are, \\"welcome to my life\\" (of course...) \\"Perfect World\\" \\"Me Against the world\\" \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Untitled\\". I think \\"Untitled\\" has to be the best song that Simple Plan has ever written. I would buy the entire CD just for that song. So yeah, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is a must have and if you dont have it, you should buy it cause its definetly worth it and i promise you will enjoy it for a long time! SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS!
B000068TPN|4.0|I was just a child during the Vietnam conflict and I've never served in the military.  Though I currently have a brother serving proudly in the U.S. Army, my own experiences are strictly cinematic.  I wholeheartedly embrace the message this film espouses and any criticisms of it are strictly artistic.  I completely embrace the accounts of Hal Moore and his experiences in Vietnam it's just unfortunate that he did not have a more skilled director like Coppola, Kubrick, or Stone instead of a relative novice film-maker like Randall Wallace.  Better yet, star Mel Gibson should have taken the directorial reigns of this film.  The movie's strength is in it's acting and story.  Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as Moore.  The underrated Sam Elliott gave an awardworthy turn as Moore's gruff aide, Plumley.  Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell are equally good as the women that are left at home.  Greg Kinnear as the cocky chopper pilot is a change of pace for him.  I like the way the film juxtaposes events, going from the battlefield, to the homefront where the wives await the news from the frontlines, to the Americans' Vietcong counterparts who are not faceless entities who have loved ones as well and are just as resolute in the cause that they are fighting for.  This is a story well worth telling, however, it could have been tightened up better.  At times, scenes seem to drag on or it's unclear what exactly is going on in the heat of the battle.  On the whole, the film is a success but it deserved to be better.
B0000C1733|5.0|Hey <br />Even though i think they left out some really awesome tracks (around the world for example) this album still kicks ass. I highly recommend this to people who are just becoming aquainted with the greatness that is RHCP, i think they will find this album very enjoyable. This album is a must have but there is lots of other great RHCP cds like Blood sugar sex magik and californication. If you want to get a taste for some of thier earlier stuff i recommend What hits?! its interesting to see the way the bands sound has changed and grown after the death of hillel (RIP) and the joining of john frusciante.  <br /> <br />Now since i am only 14, i think it is safe to say that i have missed out on some great music. Much of the popular music today doesn't really interest me, don't get me wrong i love bands like the foo fighters, powderfinger and alot of others but i really want to discover the stuff i've missed.  <br />Thanks to my parents i have really gotten into David Bowie and the Bealtes and many others. I want to get to know some stuff like the smashing pumpkins, nirvana, the talking heads, the ramones and anything else that you would recomend. i know this isn't a board or anything but if someone happens to read this and could recomend an album or a band or sumthing it would really be appreciated!     thanx <br />

B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney Spears has never claimed to be a Sarah Brightman or a Celine Dion. Her contribution to the world of music over the last five years, has been catchy, hook-laden and fun pop, and more recently, dance music, accompanied by colorful videos and great dance routines. During this time, this young woman has somehow managed to spawn a mega-successful musical career, and an obsessed fan-base, and an equally-obsessed base of critics. Whether its her big eyes, her manufactured vamp-image, or her personal life, Britney Spears is now an icon, and with that comes endless social judgment, love and hate (from the masses).  <br /> <br />But the fact that often gets lost in the mix, is the fact that this still-incredibly-young woman has actually put out some great records. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is a great reminder of why Britney Spears is a huge star. Some may not agree, but songs like \\"Slave,\\" \\"Crazy,\\" \\"Oops,\\" \\"..One More Time,\\" and \\"Toxic\\" are pop/dance classics for an entire generation, and more recent tracks like \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Do Somethin'\\" are actually pretty solid. Even the cover of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\" is almost better than the original, and the remixes on this CD (especially \\"Breathe on Me\\") are excellent. Tracks that should have been included on here are \\"Brave New Girl\\" and the Thunderpuss mix of \\"Slave.\\" Nonetheless, this collection of music, spans the incredible half-decade career of pop music's reigning Queen.
B000000OAC|5.0|By the time Queen released 'News of the World', they had gone from 'Queen I' to 'A Day at the Races' in a Bohemian burst of energy. Probably more than they ever imagined they would. They had done it, and to me this album seems a bit lost in theme.  <br /> <br />Compared to the other albums, it just doesnt flow as well from song to song - as if it is a compilation. Saying that , there are some really execellent pieces of work on this album, some real contrasts. Why they never released 'Spread your wings' is a mystery, as it is one of their best songs. Even Roger Taylors 'Fight from the inside' has a great rawness to it, and is one of his best (together with Tenement Funster - Sheer Heart Attack).  <br /> <br />There are no Bohemian Rhapsody's on here, but, you will not be dissapointed by it.  <br /> <br />When I listen to the last song 'My Meloncholy Blues' , I can imagine a pissed Freddie slumbering on his piano after one of his legendary parties. And you just think -  What a strange but brilliant guy! <br />One of a kind! :-)
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This collection is fantastic. It includes the radio versions of \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman,\\" \\"From This Moment On\\" and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" (and probably a few others as well). Only thing I'm bummed about is that \\"God Bless The Child\\" was left off, as the single version was much longer and more realized than the album version, and they left off \\"You've Got A Way,\\" which is a beautiful song, and it was a bigger hit than \\"Come On Over.\\" Other than that, this collection is fantastic, and the new songs are terrific.
B0006284JQ|5.0|THIS STUFF KICKS ASS.ALL 17 SONGS ON THIS ARE GREAT,ESPECIALLY OF COURSE THE HIT MY PREROGATIVE,THAT SONG REALLY KICKS BUTT.THE OTHER 16 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ALSO ARE GOOD CHOICES,OF A HOT LOOKING SINGER,WITH A GREAT BODY,AND A GRAT SINGING VOICE.I HOPE YOUR BREAK DON'T LAST LONG,SO I COULD HEAR SOME MORE HOT MUSIC FROM YOU.
B00005GL0V|4.0|Historically there is a real sense in which the \\"Let It Be\\" album made it easier to accept the idea that the Beatles had broken up. Not just because the album is essentially the soundtrack from the film that showed the Beatles disintegrating right before our eyes, but also because it is just not a great Beatles album, certainly not in comparison to \\"Abbey Road\\" (or even the collection of singles like \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\" that Apple put out after the end, most of which ended up on the CD \\"Past Masters - Volume Two\\").<br /><br />The culprit who is fingered for this disaster (a Beatles album that is not \\"great\\" qualifies as a disaster), is Phil Spector, who was brought in to do some post-production mixing and overdubs.  But the only song that really got the legendary \\"Wall of Sound\\" treatment was \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" with \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" only getting a touch of the same.  That is not much to hang Spector as the primary culprit.  The biggest sin here is that he did not work with the Beatles the same way that George Martin always did and the responsibility for so many of the songs being sub-standard has to fall on the Beatles who wrote them.  Personally, I never liked \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" half as much as \\"Hey Jude\\" (it was like comparing all of Led Zeppelin's ambitious songs to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in the next decade).<br /><br />It helps a little bit to recall that the idea here was that the Beatles were performing these songs live (who can forget the famous rooftop concert), in another attempt to get excited about their music. Sometimes I just think of \\"Let It Be\\" as the anti-Sgt. Pepper album, because whereas that classic Beatles album has a superb sense of construction from start to finish, the songs on this one seem to be arranged in a haphazard fashion (e.g., \\"Dig a Pony\\" followed by \\"Across the Universe\\"). I know this seems a strange thing to say after \\"The White Album\\" and side 2 of \\"Abbey Road,\\" but both of those albums still have cohesiveness even when they are splicing unfinished songs together that this one is totally missing. Maybe on a subliminal level the group was telling the world \\"You WANT us to break up, because this is what you get from here on out.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line is I still listen to this one from time to time, but still a lot less than any other Beatles album (yes, I listen to \\"side 1\\" of the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack more than \\"Let It Be\\"). Besides, everybody knows it is not a real Beatles album if George Martin is not the producer.  When \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" came out in 2003, having mixed out Spector's contributions, deleted the bits of conversation, cut a couple of songs (\\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\"), added \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and resequenced the tracks, it just struck me as too little too late.  At best it was a marginally better album.  No wonder \\"Abbey Road\\" is considered the \\"last\\" Beatles album.  It is not just because it was recorded after \\"Let It Be,\\" but because it lets the Beatles go out on a much higher note (plus \\"The End\\" gets to serve as a benediction of sorts).d,\\" but both of those albums still have cohesiveness even when they are splicing unfinished songs together that this one is totally missing.

I would recomend this album to anyone who likes good music.\\"Prisonsers in Paradise\\"is one of those albums you can just push play an not worry about,Every song on this album is killer.Go buy it.
B000062Y44|4.0|Badly Drawn boy tackled a different kind of project in this album -- the soundtrack for the amusing movie adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel, \\"About A Boy.\\" His blend of melodic folk-pop and all-too-brief instrumentals are just like the novel -- bright, breezy and subtle. What's even better? \\"About A Boy Soundtrack\\" is just as good when separated from the film.<br /><br />It opens with a sunny piano melody, just a cute little ditty that doesn't last half a minute. Then it shifts into the mellow, sharp keyboard pop of \\"A Peak You Reach,\\" before blossoming into a blend of poppy folk (the soothing \\"Something To Talk About\\" and fun \\"River Sea Ocean\\") and folky pop (the slightly eerie \\"Silent Sigh and bouncy \\"File Me Away\\").<br /><br />Sprinkled through these are instrumental interludes, some less than a minute long. But despite their brevity, these little instrumentals manage to feel well-rounded and full. One a particular highlight is \\"Delta (Little Boy Blues),\\" an enchanting pop tune augmented by horns and what sounds like an organ.<br /><br />No wonder Nick Hornby wanted Badly Drawn Boy (real name: Damon Gough) for the soundtrack to \\"About a Boy.\\" While there are occasional lapses -- \\"S.P.A.T\\" is a fragmented electronic mess -- the mellow, autumnal sound of this soundtrack is just entrancing. Yes, the Hugh Grant movie about a Peter-Pannish thirtysomething was good -- but the music alone is a prize.<br /><br />Gough is to be commended for having his songs \\"flow\\" into one another -- it feels a bit like a sprawling, many-toned song that has been carefully divided into bits and pieces, then stitched back together. It doesn't have the experimental feel of his non-soundtrack albums, but the delicate piano, guitar, strings, harmonica and blazing brass blend into a smooth, mellow sound.<br /><br />Gough's voice sounds sort of... well, timid, as if he doesn't want to make it too prominent in the music. But his voice is a pleasant voice, almost childlike in its exuberance and emotion. Which makes his sometimes melancholy songs sound even more so, when he sings almost pleadingly, \\"Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh/Keeps down all move me down/Could we love each other?\\"<br /><br />It's no \\"Hour of Bewilderbeast.\\" Instead, this breezy pop album is \\"About A Boy,\\" a \\"bewilderbeast\\" in its own category. Badly Drawn Boy's second release is a thoroughly pretty, sweet and often entrancing creation. Bravo, Damon.ncholy songs sound even more so, when he sings almost pleadingly, \\"Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh/Keeps down all move me down/Could we love each other?\\"    It's no \\"Hour of Bewilderbeast.\\" Instead, this breezy pop album is \\"About A Boy,\\" a \\"bewilderbeast\\" in its own category.

B000001ESN|5.0|Un pot pourri de ce qu'un fan de Rush recherche, voil une vue gnrale de Permanent Waves. Des paroles recherches, des rythmes complexes et accrocheurs (pour vous nombreux batteurs fans du groupe :), du rock crit avec grand art sans devenir strile. Tous les lments y sont pour en faire un classique du genre. Voici un aperu par titre : <br /> <br />The Spirit of Radio: N'importe qui ayant accs  une station classic rock a de trs bonne chances d'tre dj tomb sur cet incontournable de concert pour Rush depuis 25 ans. Le riff de dpart est impressionnant et le petit bout reggae  la fin est une heureuse trouvaille.  propos de l'intgrit musicale vs la radio commerciale. Un classique. ***** <br /> <br />Freewill: Un autre standard radiophonique. D'excellents vers de Neil Peart  propos des dogmes. Le bridge donne un bon aperu du talent d'Alex Lifeson dans un solo brillant en plus des capacits hors du commun de M. Peart. **** <br /> <br />Jacob's Ladder: Ils s'amusent  jouer en temps composs (11/4 au dbut et 6/8-7/8 pour la seconde partie). Le batteur que je suis peine toujours  garder le beat tout le long :) Du rock mathmatique en deux mouvements. Un de mes favoris dans les oublies du band. *****  <br /> <br />Entre Nous: Dernire contribution lyrique en solo de Geddy Lee. Celle-ci ne me fait pas lever autant que les autres. Une bonne transition dans le contexte de l'album malgr tout. ***1/2 <br /> <br />Different Strings: Plus slow un peu que le reste de l'album. L'instrumentation est vraiment excellente en gnral. Dommage qu'elle soit aussi courte (le solo de la fin aurait gagner  durer 30-40 sec. de plus). ****1/2 <br /> <br />Natural Science: Tout un accomplissement! Un hymne  la conscientisation face  l'environnement en 3 parties. Excellents vers de Neil Peart (Living in their pools they soon forget about the sea). Dans mon top 3 des meilleures compos de 9+ minutes de Rush avec La Villa Strangiato et Xanadu. En concert c'est de la bombe! Excellent. ***** <br /> <br />En bout de ligne, un album accessible runissant tous les aspects qui font de Rush une version amliore d'un trio rock conventionel. Paroles, technique, motion, nergie. Si vous ne bockez pas sur la voix disons \\"spciale\\" de Geddy Lee il y a de forte chance que vous deveniez acro de ces Torontois sympathiques :) Fortement recommand aux initis tout comme aux jeunes gens comme moi il y a 2 ans qui dsirent les connatre aprs avoir entendu quelques tounes. 5/5 capitaine!

B0002Z9HT8|3.0|In the world of marketing vs. history, marketing will win out everytime.  If you all buy the cut down version of this historic event within the next 20 years you will be able to buy the whole box set.  I was truly looking to see the whole event in the order that it ran, but guess I'll have to wait a little longer.  I have always wanted to show these young metal heads that Led Zeppelin did have a bad show, and that Sting used to be the best.  No Jam reunion because Paul Weller knew it would overshadow the Style Council.  If you could see the whole Style Council performance you would agree, or maybe not.  The price alone is worth seeing U2 in all their glory.  History will win out but I hope that I am not too old too care when it does.  I suspect in 20 years it will be a Time Life series.

B000007XUQ|5.0|When most pop musicians record Christmas albums, they are merely novelty additions to their musical catalogs.  In the case of the Carpenters, their \\"Christmas Collection\\" is arguably their finest recording.  Karen Carpenter is probably the greatest female pop vocalist of all time, and her voice is perfect for Christmas music.  There isn't a weak moment in this 2 CD set.  Karen's voice is beautiful throughout, and the musical accompaniment is absolutely magnificant.  Listening to this set will bring back childhood Christmas memories more than any other holiday disc out there.  It will make you feel happy and sad at the same time.  This holiday masterpiece is timeless and will appeal to all generations.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I completely agree with one of the reviewers about this CD. This CD may be more relevant now than ever considering what this country and the rest of thee world is going through. It's been arguably called the best CD recorded in the 20th century, and once you listen to it, you see why. My version has only nine songs, but it is a masterpiece nontheless. From top to bottom, he sings from his heart and tells stories of the world, of God and everything in between through his eyes. My favorite song on the CD is \\"God is Love.\\" Through everything we go through, Marvin reminds us that God is the center, the key, and that he is love.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This was my first Bowie cd and it rocked my world, excuse the term.  I can't get enough of him now.  If you are a Bowie virgin this is a good way to get hooked and if you are an old timer then you should already own it(shakes head).  In more detail soul love and ziggy stardust are my favorite songs on the cd. However, I could easily listen to it a hundred times all the way through and not need a break.  They are all great art as well as fun to listen to.
B000002ULO|5.0|I am surprised that of the 126 reviews I read, only a handful mentioned Linda McCartney's death in reference \\"Flaming Pie.\\" This album is a beautifully-crafted, soul-searching valentine to Linda McCartney before her passing. <br /> <br />Although not all of the songs deal with this subject specifically, when you listen closely, you cannot help but hear Paul add the echoes of what will soon pass on this album. Knowing that this would probably be his last recording with Linda, Paul seemed to dig deep into his Beatle influences and ideas... the very things he and Linda shared together in their beginnings. Songs like \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Beautiful Night\\" bring back the Beatles sound and remind us of Paul's very public love for his wife. Having old hands from the past, such as Ringo and George Martin, complete the idea of this recording as a back-to-basics, emotion driven record. <br /> <br />\\"Flaming Pie\\" manages the deft feat of professing complete love for your soul mate while revisiting a personal past of creativity and music that changed the world. I believe this record emboldened Paul McCartney to push his music and life further. \\"Driving Rain\\" is evidence of that.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This was the first Josh Groban CD I bought, but I'll definitely buy his debut album now. To think that someone so young can make an album of such magnitude! He is a truly gifted singer and thank God he can share this gift with the rest of the world through his CD's. I can't wait until he comes to Europe for a concert.There isn't a song on this album that doesn't take my breath away, although my favourites are Mi Mancherai (the \\"duet\\" with the violin works magically), When you say you love me and You raise me up. Buying this album is worth everyting you spend on it and makes a great (romantic) gift as well.    ALSO RECOMMENDED: Mehdi~Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 - Samples are at SoothingMusic.Com...A True Gem, Just Go Listen.
B0000029DD|5.0|I started off thinking that Jeff Bukley's version of Hallelujah was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard a person sing... a song capable of making me weep uncontrollably if I go there with it.  However, now I realize there are about four songs on this CD that are also the most beautiful things I've ever heard.  \\"Grace\\" is a song of such ecstasy, you simply wonder where it came from.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Nothing short of brillant in that Harrison mixes beautiful melodies with poignant life themes. Death, God, Life, Darkness, reincarnation. Recorded at the beginning of the 70's and during some turbelence regarding the Beatles breakup... it truely is his masterpiece. What Harrison lacks in vocal presence he more than makes up in his unparalled bold song writing. This record places Harrison right next to Lennon/Mccartney in achievement. This is a record that can be listened to over and over again. It simply does not, like LIFE; lose its wonderment!
B0006284JQ|4.0|I like but the promotion song My Prerogative is too boring anything compared with what she accustoms to make, also good lacks songs one that I like too much Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is very good, it should have put Overprotected in the original version the one that put it is bad, of rest I find excellent.
B00005ATQF|2.0|Others here have summarized \\"Full Metal Jacket's\\" plot.  Let me just add for the record that it's pretty clear Kubrick never intended to make a realistic film about what \\"actually\\" happened in Vietnam.  Instead, his movie explores the psychology behind the war.  In classic misanthropic fashion, Kubrick presents humanity as a hopelessly twisted species who've fetishized violence to the point that soldiers literally fall in love with their guns.  As he sees it, Vietnam was the biggest sexual dysfunction in history.      A pretty bleak vision... and in my opinion, a little simplistic.  But as the last film made from beginning to end under Kubrick's exacting specifications (\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" was completed after his death), \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is definitely worth watching.  Especially the taut first half, which ought to be on every filmmaking teacher's curriculum as an object lesson in telling a story with brutal simplicity.    A film this important deserves an archival-quality DVD release.  Sadly, this ain't it.      Yes, the picture clarity and sound quality are top-notch... but the film is presented in \\"full screen\\" pan-and-scan format only.  That's particularly awful when you consider Kubrick was reknowned for paintakingly composing shots; framing and symmetry were of utmost importance to him.      I'm told he gave the OK to have his own film amputated like this -- he wasn't a fan of \\"letterboxing,\\" which he found distracting.  Of course, he also died before the proliferation of wide-screen TVs and the like.  My hope is there'll one day be a DVD release that preserves the original formatting.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Interesting how quite a number of people who gave this documentary one star didn't manage to respond with a well-argued and intelligent rebuttal, but were reduced to spewing out vitriolic insults about how Michael Moore is fat. What's your point? Socrates was also a bit of a lard ass but we don't think of him today as some bloated, beardy Greek but as a man who managed to teach people to think for themselves for a change.     Personally I don't believe you need to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 to know something is fundamentally wrong with the Bush administration. All you need is a triple digit IQ and a brain capable of independent thought. Sadly not everyone is gifted with such intelligence and that's why we need people like Michael Moore to spell things out for us. This is especially true in a country where a not insignificant number of voters, right up to election day, still thought that Hussein was responsible for 9/11, that Iraq is armed to the teeth and George Bush is the only thing standing between us and the forces of Evil. The hard truth that most republicans will refuse to accept is that it was stupidity, ignorance and above all fear that got Bush re-elected.    And even if we disagree with Moore's main contention: that George Bush bombed a defenceless third world country, killing over 100,000 civilians, just to steal their oil, the incredible irony remains, that on November 2nd a huge number of republicans who voted for Bush did so \\"on moral grounds\\". For these people the deaths of over eleven hundred soldiers and countless thousands of innocent men, women and children was less important than preventing gays from marrying!!! But then perhaps it's easy for predominantly white fundamentalist Christians to condone the needless slaughter of so many innocents when the innocents concerned are just little brown Muslims in some far off part of the world they couldn't even find on a map if they tried.     To finish, I obviously accept that Saddam Hussein was an evil man who murdered, tortured and incarcerated without trial many of his own people. Well now, thanks to Bush, so have we. Michael Moore may have failed in his quest to kick Bush out or the White House, but if he caused even a handful of flag-waving jingoists to start thinking for themselves for a change then he has achieved at least some measure of success. Remember, to love your country does not mean never to question its actions; that's one of the fundamental differences between democracy and totalitarianism.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|The concert is tragically missing so very much. It is still worth having the US version but to spoil your fun, go to amazon uk (under Product Details, click on the \\"DVD formats\\" link to understand why you shouldn't buy the uk 4 disc set) and see what you are missing.  Other disgruntled reviewers also spelled out what is left off the US discs.  What a tragedy.  Thousands would happily pay more to get the real thing in its entirity.  It was a great event.  I was happy to have worked on it.
0380789019|5.0|After reading everything Douglas Adams ever wrote I, and I'm sure many of us, needed more of that British style fantasy-sci fi-humor-all in one writing. It had to be British, it had to be \\"Adams like but not quite\\". Fortunately I found just such an author. Neverwhere is my first Gaiman novel. It was the perfect fit for what I was looking for. Pure horror, pure science fiction, pure fantasy and even pure comedy are different, very different from this. It is the blend that makes this book excellent. As for Richard Mayhew (Neverwhere main character) looking too much like Arthur Dent (the beloved Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy sort of hero) GREAT!!! And the good news is, there's Gaiman and a bunch of other writers giving form to this refreshing style of writing. As an engineering professor I have to read lots of technical books, all the time. Once in a while I escape my \\"professional reading\\" and engage in \\"leisure reading\\" for a change, Neverwhere gave me that kind of change.
B000002UAX|4.0|Where to start with the White Album.  A definite classic and recommended.  Almost like all four members doing four solo albums and combining them all on one album.  Some of the songs sound like traditional Beatle songs, most of the others sound non traditional/experimental but overall a must have for any classic rock fan.  Maybe instead of the \\"White Album\\" it should have been named \\"Helter Skelter\\"....
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I'm sure like most people I was excited to see they were releasing Live-Aid on DVD, but then disappointed to see all the songs that are missing.  Since I was at the Philadlephia show from around 7:00am - 11:00pm, I was not able to record any video of the show.  For that reason I will probably end up buying the DVD.  The thing that I just can't seem to get passed is the fact that Led Zepplin pulled out of the project.  I have been to many many concerts over the last 30 years, but no moment in any of them quite measured up to the near perfection of the moment that occured during the performance of Stairway to Heaven all those nights ago at JFK Stadium.  Something happened in the crowd during that song.  It was as if every single soul in the stadium became one for a few brief minutes, and the charitable reasons for paying $35 a ticket, (a fortune back then), became clear.  It was like for once we finally got it, finally understood. <br />I'm sure some of it was my imagination, but I never experienced anything like that before of since.  It really is a shame that Plant, Page, and Jones can't see that side of things.  Oh Well, what are you gonna do.  Anyway I'd like to send out a special thanks to the woman sitting behind us, who had the bandanas soaking in the cooler of ice water, Don't think we would have survived the heat without them!!!  Rock On....And stay cool ! <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All of the Fab Four's #1 hit singles from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". A great place to start for beginning Beatlemaniacs, and for everyone else just a good, simple addition to your music collection.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This CD has all of the #1 hits from Shania Twain from over the years. I bought this CD because they are all my favorite songs plus they are all on one CD. I just put in the CD and listen for hours. This CD has 3 new songs and they are awesome! I was lucky enough to see Shania Twain on November 5th 2004 in Nashville, TN at the Good Morning America show. After camping out for 12.5 hours in the cold weather it was well worth it to see her perform the new song \\"Party for Two\\" with Billy Currington. I would suggest this CD to anybody no matter what their age is. It would make a really good gift for the holidays!!
B000002A46|5.0|I think this has to be the last good recording she ever did.  I love this cd and it is the most played during the holiday season.  After this CD I think her career just went down hill and she couldn't reach the success she once had.  All my friends and I agree about that.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Rubbish. I WAS THERE in 1964, when the British invasion hit the states. They were phenomenal. Stayed together for 10 years. That's a long time for a four man talented Band. Yeah, they fought at the end. Ringo explained it best,when he commented on why the group broke apart. They all wanted to do different things in Music,other than \\"being a Beatle\\". I cannot agree that this was all slanted toward Paul,and John was largely ignored.Let us all remember that John had been gone for over 10 years when this came about. There is no real credit given to Yoko Ono, but I am afraid she was used too much as a source.Face facts,people....Yoko was not liked when John brought her to all the sessions,by the rest,and it showed in their last recordings, with the exception of Abbey Road. They were a part of my younger days,and today,I look back fondly to when they were the \\"toppermost of the Poppermost\\".
B00063MBU8|5.0|Im a girl that has been really excited about the release of this cd since I heard they were recording new material back in  May.Let me just say,it was worth the wait.This CD is completely breathtaking.They still sound like the simple plan we all know and love but they also matured lyrically and musically.This is one cd that you dont have to skip any of the songs,they are all good.My personnal favorite is the untitled one.I think I love it so much because it was a totally unexpected song from this band,and something about Pierre's voice makes it really special(and different).I cried the first time I heard it because it touched me soo much. <br />anyways,I think this cd is really worth buying and no one would regret buying it.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I loved Before Sunrise and my expectations for Before Sunset were high.............and they were definitely met!<br /><br />Before Sunset actually gives the audience credit for having enough imagination to figure out what is or isn't happening in this movie. It is one of the most mature romances I have seen yet. Buy this movie and the prequel and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Hummm? Two people....what was......what could have been....what may be??? Could you ask for more? This movie has everything. But be warned.........if you want all of your dialogue handed to you on a silver platter, if you want is \\"spelled\\" out for you, if you like your movies \\"easy\\" then stay away. It's not for you. You should go see Star Wars III instead and you may be more satisfied.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|It makes sense to have a GREATEST HITS CD for Shania in some ways. If you're a casual fan, here you have it all her hits on one cd. Even if you're a fan that works too. Having only 3 new songs though isn't much pull to buy the cd. Considering all the songs that were hits are taken from her 3 major albums. Anyway it's a small complaint. Some of the highlights of the hits include \\"The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)\\" which is my favorite Shania ballad, \\"Love Gets Me Every Time\\", \\"Forever and For Always\\", \\"Any Man Of Mine\\", \\"You Win My Love\\", and more. There are two versions of \\"Party For Two\\", one country with Billy Currington, one pop with Mark McGrath. \\"Dont\\" will be featured in the new Jennifer Lopez movie AN UNFINISHED LIFE, and it's a nice introspective ballad. \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is the most country song she's done in a while.
B000001GQR|5.0|This historic CD features two symphonic masterpieces, Schubert's 9th in C major, the \\"Great\\" and Haydn's 88th in G major, performed by William Furtwangler conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. The sound of the orchestra is unusually round, warm and full. I found these performances overwhelming.<br /><br />Furtwangler was a leading romantic conductor of the mid-20th Century who distrusted the recording studio.  His performance of the Schubert Ninth shows great fluidity of tempo and rhythm -- witness how the music develops inexorably from the slow horn-call of the opening to the allegro tempo of the movement -- and great control of dynamics.  The performance captures the lyricism and drama of this, one of the greatest of all symphonies. Furtwangler's reading also preserves the unity and form of this work -- no mean accomplishment given its length, difficulty and repetitive passages which sometimes defeat this symphony in the hands of a lesser conductor and musicians.<br /><br />The Haydn 88th receives an incandescent reading. It is one of the best and most inspiring performances of Haydn I have heard.  It is a large scale rather than a chamber reading which  captures the spirit of the music in a way that is also idiosyncratic and romantic in character.<br /><br />Schubert's Ninth is one of the glories of music full of song, drama, and heroism.  It is a lengthy difficult symphony that was controversial in its day. (Schubert could not get it performed.)  It opens with a famous call for the horns in a theme that becomes the basis for the first movement. This theme alternates with a more dramatic, lively second theme.  The first movement is both lyrical and heroic and is conducted here with high seriousness.  The second movement begins with a long, lyrical theme for the oboe followed by sections of deep tranquility and high passion.  The winds come through well in this mono-era recording.  The third movement begins with a brusque theme in the lower strings followed by a trio which is the epitome of heroism. (I recently read a book on the Battle of Gettysburg in which the author, Kent Gramm, aptly referred to the third movement of this symphony as an appropriate symbol for the stand of the Union's \\"Iron Brigade\\" at McPherson's Ridge on the first day of the Battle. This is a rare comparison which helped me understand better both Schubert's music and the battle.)  The long, difficult finale, with its triplet theme, and dramatically descending scale passages, is a great movement of symphonic music.<br /><br />Schubert's Ninth sings of heroism and strength in the face of death. Furtwangler conveys the strength, lyricism and depth of this score by a composer of genius who died young.<br /><br />Haydn's symphony no. 88, unlike Schubert's 9th, is a work of a composer who lived to maturity.  The first movement opens with a slow introduction consisting of large, stately chords followed by a few bars of a flowing theme.  This is followed by an allegro which opens with a soft, brushing theme and then gets louder.  Furtwangler's reading shows great command of dynamics and use of the winds as the movement progresses.  The slow movement features a theme which is repeated and embellished several times with different accompaniments and textures.  It is the highlight of this symphony.  The minuet is both glittering and stately in a theme given forth by the strings with the tympani in the background.  Furtwangler slows down for the trio which flows in the strings with an accompaning drone figure.  After a huge and dramatic crescendo, the theme of the minuet returns.  The finale is a rondo, quick and humorous, with a lively skipping theme. There are two dramatic episodes followed by a sweeping uptempo close.  Furtwangler in this recording treats Haydn with utmost seriousness and depth. He allows the listener to hear that Haydn was a truly great composer and that the 88th is music of the highest order.<br /><br />This is an essential CD for three reasons:Furtwangler's conducting, Schubert's music, and Haydn's music. Bravo throughout.or three reasons: Furtwangler's conducting, Schubert's music, and Haydn's music. Bravo throughout.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is very different from the first album. It's much more sophisicated with the lyrics. The guys sound different but they still have songs that will always stay in your head. The songs seem to be more upbeat. So go and buy it. You'll really enjoy it and listen to it constantly.
B00007AJF9|5.0|This movie is great even if you aren't a history buff...the story spans and amazing life, and the transformation in Blanchett is unbelievable.  If you are at all familiar with Queen Elizabeth (or owned a Norton's anthology), you will probably experience some dejavu when seeing some of the beautiful scenes.  This is an intense movie, and one that will lead you into a real appreciation of Blanchett's abilities.
068987474X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but as a gay male, I was wondering if the same holds true for gay relationships...is it as black and white as \\"male pursues female?\\"  There is a guy that I know that I think he likes me, he flirts with me and kisses me on the cheek and hugs me all the time, but he has never asked me out...never asked for my phone number and such...so does that mean that he's just not that into me?  Greg and Liz, could you give your advice on gay relationships and what rules apply?  Great book nonetheless!!!
B00004UEE5|5.0|The Chicago Symphony Orchestra has the largest video archive of any orchestra in the country. From 1948-2001, only one man could be seen in every recording: CSO principal trumpet Adolph 'Bud' Herseth. This is the last visual recording Bud made with the orchestra, and what better choice of program could there be? Bud always played Mahler's 5th like it was written for him, and the well-deserved tribute he receives at the end of the performance is not just for another awe-inspiring performance, but for 53 years of showing the world how the trumpet can and should sound. This is a 1997 performance, and Bud was born in 1921... you do the math! This DVD should be seen by any brass player. The CSO's legendary tradition of excellence in brass-playing has never been more evident.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I have owned my copy of this for about 15 years and still watch it at least once a year. I read the book about once a year too and hardly ever have to imagine some part of it because this version is pretty faithful and I can see all the best parts onscreen. I read another review and realized that I'm not crazy, there WAS more to the A&E series. The extra 100 minutes couldn't have been all commercials, could it? When the powers that be decide to release it on DVD, I hope they will include all of it. We fans know how long it is and don't mind. You are doing us no favors cutting it down! <br /> <br />Anyway, toss all the other versions that make Jane a modern woman or cut out everything to make it 90 minutes long. You'll get the truest and best version with this one.
B00012QLQ4|4.0|by now ,every anime fan knows the story of akira .of what will happen when adolescence get mixed up with telekinetics.so i won't bore you with it.and also ,every anime fan knows the story isn't that good.but it has some of the most astounding and stunning scenes you'll ever see in  a japanese animated film. <br />i have a subtitled akira video.but with subtitles you either chase around subtitles and miss out on  some  of the visuals ,or concentrate on the visuals and miss out the plot.  until now. thank god for dvds. <br />digitally remastered with a new english dialogue.the dubbed and subtitled versions all in one.no making of in the extras nor trailers. but you'll get the capsule option.where a capsule, similar to the one on kaneda's jacket,shows up during the film whenever there is a graffiti in the scenes.nice. <br />it may not be the best,but it's a great introduction to   <br /> R rated anime films.
0671027344|5.0|This book is a must read for every teenager.  Stephen Chbosky did an amazing job with every little detail of Charlie's life.   <br />This is by far the best book that I have read and I tend to like teenage delunquient, drugs, sex, alcohol books.
068987474X|1.0|I gave this book one star because it's legible.  That's the only good thing I can say about it.  Thank God that it wasn't out in the 1980s, when my husband and I were dating.  In those days, we spent a lot of time \\"breaking up and making up\\".  The guy who wrote this book, had he known me then, would have told me that my guy \\"just wasn't into me\\".  And like a dummy, I would have believed him.  Then I would have cheated myself out of the best thing I've had in this life - the guy that I was always breaking up with!  Not to mention the twelve wonderful years of marriage we've had since then and our two beautiful children. <br /> <br />I urge all of you young single women to quit buying self-help books like this and have the guts to listen to your own heart. Yes, I know Oprah endorsed this. I like Oprah, but she does not rule my world and she should not control yours!  Listening to your heart and following it is never easy, but unlike this book, it will never steer you wrong.
B000002HMH|5.0|Let me start by saying one thing.  The mid 90's Metallica is NOT the early 80's Metallica, and THEY DON'T PRETEND TO BE!  This is a different album than Master of Puppets, and does not warrant comparison. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that Load is a brilliant hard rock album, that if recorded by any other band would have shot up the charts and gone down as an absolute classic in the genre.  In fact, Load could very well gain more and more recognition with time and eventually end up where it belongs... at the top of any hard rock fan's collection! <br /> <br />Almost every song is real solid and contains a swagger not previously evident in Metallica's music.  Song structures are simple, but the textures are immense, and the sound is HUGE.  I highly recommend Metallica's Load to any fan of good hard rock and roll.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|There are not words to describe the excellent of this collection of hit's, because all are perfectly good, the promotion song (Party For Two), it is really good I find moved something innovative and with the same one it formulates of shania that makes their sticky music.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is Lamb of God's third album, and they've nailed it. It has a better sound overall than As The Palaces Burn, but they didn't sacrifice anything to get it. An excellent album, all around. (And if you've never heard these guys before, their sound is like a heavier, more brutal Pantera.) <br /> <br />Some highlights: This album is just as brutal as anything they've done in the past, and Randy Blythe's vocals have improved. His growling is more intense, and he's added a higher pitched scream (listen to \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\"), and it's a great addition to their sound. The vocals stand out on this album more than ATPB. Musically, the band is tight. They don't miss a beat for anything, and the drumming is some of the best I've ever heard. Guitarwork is excellent as well, it's dead on, and very technical. Through great riffwork, time changes, and a few excellent solos, this album goes beyond ATPB musically as well.  I also need to mention the instrumental \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", which is an excellent guitarpiece. <br />  <br />The songs themselves are well-written, and great. There isn't a bad song on here. \\"Laid To Rest\\" is a very powerful song, and a hell of an opener here. Blythe's lyrics are very intelligent, and some of them are politically charged (I get the feeling he doesn't like George Bush very much). This is an improvement over the mindless crap on most new CD's these days. The lines that stand out the most for me come from \\"Hourglass\\", and they are: 'Anguish is realizing what could have been, but never was/ It's emptiness that fills the cup'. There's much more good stuff on this CD too. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is an excellent album. Everything on here is great, and it sounds nearly perfect. Definitely recommended for anybody who likes metal. 10/10 for the best metal album I've bought this year.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Blood, crows, ambition, arrows, fear, horror, fog, madness, death.<br /><br />The endless scenes of the frightened, whinnying horses, dashing through the impenetrable fog, reined and turned again and again by the lost, frightened and confused Mifune and Chiaki. The scene is unbearable, frustrating, and makes us understand what it is to \\"lose one's way\\" in the metaphorical sense as shown by the physical reality. This is what great film does: works on many levels, and offers us an intimate visual experience of the conceptual.<br /><br />Noh provided inspiration for Mifune's visual presence: Kuroswa showed Mifune a Noh mask and asked him to become that.<br /><br />(Between us-you always thought that Toshiro Mifune looked like a Japanese woodcut, anyway, didn't you? Something so deeply icon-like in that face! Of course Mifune was born to become THE samurai of film...he was already a part of the Japanese Collective Unconscious!)<br /><br />Lady Macbeth's performance and makeup was also inspired by Noh. The blend of physical reality (the legendary Kurosawan attention to the smallest details of set and ambience) with the presentational aspects of traditional Japanese dramaturgy creates a rich and startling tapestry from Shakespeare's familiar story.<br /><br />That this Macbeth is not language, but rather, image-driven shows us Kurosawa's great faith in the value of cinema as a form of deep human communication. He's convinced me, and I humbly submit my thanks.
B00005U8EM|4.0|This is comedy BILL MURRAY STYLE!!  The dry wit and effortless acting will make you want to watch this movie again and again.  Bill Murray plays a self-absorbed TV weatherman who gets to live one day over and over again until he gets it right. The funny part is watching Bill Murray find a way to make the same day different everytime. Rich in humor and sentiment this is one holiday movie you should not miss, even if the holiday is Groundhog day!
B0000024JN|5.0|\\"License to Ill\\" might be closing in on being a 20 year old album, but it still kicks [...]. All 13 tracks on this CD are awesome. Many people will know \\"Fight for your right\\", \\"Brass Monkey\\", and \\"Slow and Low\\" from radio play on popular alternative, retro, hip hop and college stations, but there are many other great songs on the CD as well. \\"Paul Revere\\" tells a story in a smooth rap, \\"She's Crafty\\" is a rocking rap number, and \\"Girls\\" is just plain silly. The guys were fresh and innovative in the 80's, and now in 2004, the album still sounds as good. Pick it up today to add to your retro collection!

B00003CXC6|5.0|Weather forms a central character in Kurasawa's Rashomon.<br /><br />In the story line, it's so hot...that the breeze that stirs the sleeping satyr-like panther Mifune, causes him to kill. The scene where he pulls slowly at the leather thong to which his sword is tied as he looks up into the dazzling light filtering down through the leaves...that slow movement to evil, caused by the heat and one breath of air.<br /><br />The rain that relentlessly batters the Rashomon gate forms another plot point, and sets the mood..one feels completely paralyzed....the poor humans grappling to understand the complex distortions of the horrible human drama..are frozen by their inability to understand why the story is different, depending of who tells it..and unable to leave the story alone...paralyzed from shaking it off by the rain which forces them into contemplation as they sit under the rotting gate.<br /><br />Some trickery going on, here. Why do the stories differ? A simple answer, and the one Kurosawa gave to his uncomprehending assistant directors was that we all invent our own little worlds, and our version of a story flatters our own self-concept.<br /><br />The bandit wishes to be seen as bold and powerful, beyond the confines of law. The husband, confronted with the rape, wishes to see himself as wrongfully betrayed by his wife. The wife wishes to see herself as victim. The woodcutter, when finally confronted, wishes to \\"tell the truth\\".<br /><br />The film puts \\"the truth\\" into a relativistic purgatory, and is unfathomable, and yet, completely truthful. The mental pretzels one can make trying to figure out the \\"truth\\" are less satisfying than the experience and acceptance of the story as it plays out. Hey, there are some things in life you are just not going to know.<br /><br />Kurosawa missed the beauty of the silent cinema, and aimed, in this film, to bring back a way of storytelling that depended on visual cues, camera movement, shot compostion and acting rather than dialogue to produce the film's power and emotion. This is surely one of the most exquisitely filmed works of all cinema, so sensitively photographed that the shades of grey suggest colors...!<br /><br />I see Mifune's eyes, lit by a reflection of the sun from a mirror laced with foilage (a trick the cinematographer used to increase the available light in the forest while retaining the proper \\"leaf-filtered\\" quality of the light) in color. His eyes appear chestnut.<br /><br />There is no way to understand the communication of color in a black and white film, other than to say that the communication of seeing is so fulsome, that nothing seems missing, and hey! That's kinda like the film, huh? We invent our reality.<br /><br />Rashomon is the film that catapulted Japanese film into the international cinematic consciousness, made a reputation for Kurosawa, launched Mifune to international stardom, and revolutionized cinematography.<br /><br />The sun and rain on Rashomon gate are there for you.

B000006NPY|4.0|When I first listened to this album I was not impressed. I was in love with Siamese Dream and MCIS. Adore didn't have the heavy melodic distortion that I loved so consequently I never really gave it the attention that it deserved. Just recently I thought I would give it another chance and I was blown away. This album is the Pumpkin's most complete album ever.  Every song is musically crafted and lyricly written to perfection. The songs within the album are very similar to that of their previous work except without the heavily distorted guitars.  The only thing I do not like about this album is Billy's voice. It does not blend with the music it had in previous albums.  That is the only reason I'm not giving Adore 5 stars.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks <br /> -To Sheila <br /> -Adore <br /> -Daphne Descends <br /> -Once Upon A Time <br /> -Tear <br /> -Crestfallen <br /> -Shame <br /> -Perfect <br /> <br />   If you are a Smashing Pumpkin fan, which I am, you probably wont like this album as much as their previous ones. If you disliked the Smashing Pumpkins you will love this album.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Recorded on the European leg of their tour in support of their \\"Heavy Horses\\" album, Jethro Tull's live album \\"Bursting Out\\" is a terrific concert recording of Ian Anderson & the boys, covering material from their 2nd album \\"Stand Up\\" straight through to \\"Heavy Horses.\\" The band---Anderson, Martin Barre, John Glascock, John Evan, David Palmer and Barriemore Barlow---sound tremendous on such favorites as \\"Sweet Dream,\\" \\"Songs From The Wood,\\" \\"Minstrel In The Gallery,\\" \\"Aqualung,\\" and a powerful 12-minute excerpt from the group's epic, \\"Thick As A Brick.\\" Anderson also makes for a fabulous, funny master of ceremonies, and the album's sound quality has been improved as well. The previous CD version of \\"Bursting Out\\" ommitted three tracks---\\"Sweet Dream,\\" \\"Conundrum,\\" and \\"Quatrain\\"---in order to squeeze the album onto a single CD, but this new remaster restores this double album to it's two-disc entirety, which is great. If you're a big Jethro Tull buff, then \\"Bursting Out\\" is a total must-have.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie is a MUST for your DVD collection. The film stars a great cast including one of my personal favorites Kevin Spacey. The script (although a little strange to hear about) is well written and academy award winning.  The overall look of the film is extremely nice. The vivid colors in the movie are stunning and gives the film a very artistic look. On the DVD the picture quality is great and DTS sound blows you away with outstanding uncompressed 5.1 surround sound. You can't go wrong ordering this movie, its one you're going to watch a lot!
0694003611|5.0|\\"In the great green room, there was a telephone and a red balloon, and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...\\" As I read this soothing classic to my littlest one, I hear echoes of my own mother's voice reading the same bedtime story to me (the copyright says 1947). I have passed on the tradition of letting my toddler stall for bedtime by bidding goodnight to everything around her and, of course, I make my voice fade into a whisper when I read the last lines: \\"Goodnight stars. Goodnight air. Goodnight noises everywhere.\\" <br />
B000007R1M|5.0|This album I just received (and listened at 5 times already) is a real masterpiece of the electronic rock music. It all depends on what audio equipment you actually use to ingest it. They are musical effects and details on this album that I've never seen anywhere else.<BR>Regarding the gentleman from UK, who says that it is an influential album for the &quot;wonderful music we have today&quot; I can say from start that there is no music at all these days. Not of value at least (I can't count a bunch of noises gathered together as music). <BR>Kraftwerk by themselves are unique, I dont know what influence they had, but there is nobody out there to even come close considering electronic Rock. <BR>Some consider it dance music. Well, I also danced on Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin, but they are not into dance music at all. You can dance on anything if the mood is right. You can dance on Kraftwerk, oh yeah ! you bet you can ! But that doesn't make this album a dance album. Man Machine is a real musical album and I recommend to read the reviews for each piece writen here by Kraftwerk lovers.<BR>The Man-Machine is a masterpiece.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The Matrix is one of those few films whose image quickly became tarnished solely because of its sequels. Revolutions joins Reloaded as a failed attempt to further explain a once fresh concept introduced in the first movie. Never before has an original idea start out so interesting only to end so horribly. Not even the special effects and action scenes (which were still overdone and grating to the eyes) could save Revolutions. Fortunately, everyone can finally breathe a sigh of relief to know that this will indeed be the last in the Matrix series. At least that is something everyone can agree on.<br /><br />There are so many unnecessary and disjointed elements in Revolutions, it's difficult to figure out where to begin. Aside from the fact that Keanu Reeves still has no idea how to be a good actor, it's safe to say that the pointless Train Man and little Indian girl sequences were obviously included to add more flavor to the already dull cast of characters. Trinity's death scene was just plain laughable and forgettable, Morpheus's presence serves absolutely no purpose in this movie at all, and the battle in Zion just goes on and on and on. Even the silly final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was far from impressive and not the spectacular finale it was supposed to be. And what is up with Neo anyway? In Reloaded, he flies around as if he were Superman. In Revolutions, he becomes blind with sensing abilities like Daredevil. What in the world?<br /><br />What's even worse is how Revolutions tries to conclude the series, and with undesirable results. We waited until the last film only to have a truce between man and machine? In the end, the machines still have control over the humans. It's all back to square one just like how it was in the first Matrix. What a waste. Nothing is truly over and you couldn't feel any sense of resolution whatsoever. If Reloaded was considered to be the worst sequel to a movie, then Revolutions takes the throne of being the worst ending to a trilogy. The Matrix trilogy will certainly go down as one of the most disappointing trilogies in cinema history and a complete embarrassment to the sci-fi genre. That may be the case, but at least we can all watch the very first Matrix movie in all its sci-fi cult classic glory without bearing its lackluster sequels in mind.Matrix trilogy will certainly go down as one of the most disappointing trilogies in cinema history and a complete embarrassment to the sci-fi genre.

B000002KKS|5.0|Ok, I'm a huge Ozzy fan. It took me years to even buy this cd let alone give it a fair chance. Once I did I was shocked. I always liked Tony Martin and Glenn Hughes but I did not want to accept this, \\"Elf\\" known as Dio. After a week of listening to this and telling myself what a terrible album it is, I realized that I'm glad Ozzy went solo. To me Ozzy will always be Sabbath. Iommi, Butler and Ward also but out of all the replacements there were many, Dio, had to be the best. I like his voice so much that I have picked up some Rainbow, some solo by him and ughhhh some Elf. Sabbath rarely does wrong by me, nope not even Headless Cross but I would rank this album right up there with Paronoid and Master of Reality. Dio's voice is that good. He reminds me of an aggressive Bruce Dickinson (Maiden). Great music for any metal fan. Pick it up, especially if you are like me and think Ozzy was the best vocalist of Sabbath and see if you don't do like me and question that after listening to this masterpiece.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah Mclachlan sings to me as I ride into work every morning. The CD kicks in and it's familiar and calming. I love her voice and the mood of the album. The first time I listened to it I wasn't sure I was going to take to it as much as past albums but the more I listen, the more I love it. I just wish I had her voice and lyrics so I could sing along. Good for road rage, stressed out drivers.
B000002A3T|5.0|an epic adventure through your own heart. when lonely, depressed, angry or whatever, this album acknowledges every mood and then melts it all away. the instrumentles are like everyone of your thoughts melting away into a sad yet sweet instant in eternity. \\"keep talking\\" the kind of song that can make the hardest of hearts weep. \\"comming back to life\\" a magnificent journey into the shinning sun. \\"marooned\\" a gentle mind melting walk into one's own soul. \\"lost for words\\" if only every hateful person in the world could here this... maybe they'd change... \\"high hopes\\" looking back at what made you happy, what made you cry, acknowledging every negative and positive moment in your life. \\"cluster one\\" if you hold a child as you here this song, you will beg for the moment to last forever, like a lullaby for both of you. \\"take it back\\" a man becomes one with the dying world around him. those are the best songs on this album but the other songs are pretty darn good too. just get this cd and turn off all your lights, lay down with a loved one and leave this hateful planet for an hour and fly. makes a good bed time cd for kids and adults too
B000000W5N|5.0|To my taste the best Stones album hands down. By the time this album was recorded musicianship in rock music was actually over taking style--of course it didn't last...but this album lives on as a fine testament to how good a melding of blues, rock and country could (and can) be. Mick Taylor--man--what tone and touch--his playing is a big part of the vibe of Stickty Fingers. I suppose what still strikes me about this work is just how authentic it sounds--its powerful gritty and yet polished at the same time. I first heard this at age 14 and I'm still listening to today with the same awe and delight--I can't say that about many other albums/CD's.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is one of my absolute favorite. Josh is so very talented...his italian is magnificent. After buying this Cd for myself,hubby, and several family members as stocking stuffers last yr, I went out and bought his other cd as well. And..saw him in concert at Jones Beach.Outrageous!! You'll love it...soothing,tranquil, and plain beautiful music.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album finally release!! I have been waiting for this for ages! This album  contains the songs of Britney. Smash Hits from Baby One More Time to Everytime. And also include 2 unreleased song. \\"Do Somethin'\\" and \\"I've Just Begun Havin My Fun\\", these 2 songs are really cool. Anyway, buy this album if you really love Britney. A MUST HAVE FOR BRITNEY'S FANS
B000002C1W|5.0|a tale of waking up from a dying dream only too a dying world... not as powerful as the division bell, but still one hell of a good journey into the oily sea, this album might just be the grim intamation of what is too be. for those who like the division bell or pulse, this is a good cd
B00005JMXX|4.0|The key to success in any summer-blockbuster type film is whether or not the script allows for enough suspension of disbelief to allow the special effects to do their job.  \\"Godzilla\\" is the perfect example of when this fails to happen; in spite of spectacular special effects, the atrocious script made the movie ridiculous and largely unwatchable.  Thankfully, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" has avoided this pitfall.  By working in enough real science, the director/writers allow the viewer to accept an otherwise unbelievable premise, and enjoy a special effects extravaganza with a surprising amount of heart. <br /> <br />That premise is that fresh water pouring of the melting polar ice caps have disrupted  the Gulf Stream, which is responsible for North America's and Northern Europe's mild climates, causing the rapid onset of an Ice Age.  As I alluded to above, this is actually a fairly accepted scientific theory, and while the timeframe is far too compressed to have any foundation in reality (ice ages take hundred or thousands of years to develop) this plausibility is sufficient to make the movie enjoyable. <br /> <br />Which is a good thing as the special effects are spectacular, and include tornados tearing apart Los Angeles, British helicopters falling out of the sky frozen solid, and the coup de grace, New York City being inundated and flash frozen.  That said, all of these bells and whistles would be for naught if it weren't for a good story, and the actors deliver a solid, if not spectacular  tale. <br /> <br />In the best tradition of the post-apocalyptic genre, the story wisely starts out globally, narrows to a national focus, and then continues to spiral down to a few key characters who can place the unimaginable in some sort of digestible context.  In this case, the viewer follows Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has predicted the consequences of polar melting, as he fights the way through the storm in an effort to rescue his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trappedin New York with several of his friends.  This personalization of a global calamity is highly effective, as it clearly represents the most basic consequences of the calamity and represents similar efforts that would be going on all over the world.  As a bonus, the film also toys with modern norms, as Americans flood over the border into Mexico, which adds an additional point of reference for this vastly altered world. <br /> <br />The DVD itself is solid if not spectacular.  The sound and image are both superb, and fully convey the experience of cutting edge special effects.  The disc also includes the usual deleted scenes (only two, which while perhaps to be expected with a special effects thriller, was somewhat disappointing) and commentaries.  Again, these are the usual, and really represent what would be the minimum standard for DVD releases; as such, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a special edition release down the road, so that's something to keep in mind. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is an enjoyable movie featuring superb effects, and a surprisingly good story.  It will particularly appeal to fans of the post-apocalyptic genre, as it pays tribute to several core themes of the genre.  However, it is easily appreciated as a thriller, and has a surprising amount of hear as well.   <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />
B00006GFAB|5.0|I just have one thing to say here folks...stop complaining!! Yeah, KISS has too many complilations, mainly due to money, but also due to so many great <br />songs they have.  <br />I read someone say that the alternative/seatle bands blew them away...WHAT?? Let's see here... <br />KISS is one of the most influential bands in history, has sold over 90 million albums, and after 30 years, is still selling out arenas all over the world. <br />Can ANY alternatve/seatle band say that... <br />NNNNOOOOOO!!! <br />How many bands in HISTORY can say that??? <br />Not many.... <br />As far as KISS being \\"silly\\" for running around in costumes...well, I'll tell you what \\"silly\\" is... <br />Silly is an alternative band dressed like bums on stage, yelling (not singing) about how bad life is...even though they're in a successful band...how sad... <br />Case closed... <br />

B000002I27|5.0|The strangeness of this album is indicated not merely by the title, but also by the obscure photography source.'Alabama Song', from the first album, is a compostion by a strange musician from early century Germany named Kurt Weill, and was originally sung by his wife, the gritty songstress Lotte Lenya.This street on the cover, is where Weill and Lenya were prominently photographed.The Doors were obviously quite taken by this unusual looking place.The characters spookily and humourously gracing this street here on \\"Strange Days\\", further enhance the European sentiments of this album.The Doors are of course, an American rock group.But the underlaying mood is here is most definitely not of Americam typicality.The cynicism of the Berlin cabaret scene, of which 'Alabama Song' is an infamous part, runs steadily through almost every song on \\"Strange Days\\".A cynicism, which is in contrast to the slick pizazz of the Broadway cabaret culture of the Doors' countrymen.<br /><br />The man with the fingers(Manzarek) must have dislodged the sound mechanism from some showground carousel to produce his contribution.It's a very different treatment to the upfront, clear and unreverbed sound of the first album's organ.This pretty musicality though, is set-off by excedingly dark lyrics, sung with the utmost gloom.The slide guitaring by Krieger sums up this contradictory sentiment with perfection.I often don't know whether to smile or to fear.Add to this Densmore's odd-ball choice of rhythms, and suddenly the carousel organ doesn't seem so pretty anymore.With the Doors, it's never really darkness by obvious means.They incorporate niceties, then display the perverted relationships that can exist with such things.<br /><br />'Strange Days', organly chord-grinds its album name-sake onto the scene, true to its word.'You're Lost Little Girl', with an easily detectable bass-line, recieves delicate treatment from Krieger's guitar and Morrison's voice.I find this album's ballads to contain his career's most pleasant singing.'Love Me Two Times' is perhaps the only track which steps outside of this album's induction of emotional confusion.I've always loved the song's well-executed rhythmic interuptions.<br /><br />Ray 'the Man' zarek, swirls throughout 'Unhappy Girl' like a Dutch organ-grinder with tulips painted on every of the instruments panels.And Krieger has no shame in bending the same note at the end of nearly every single phrase of the song.Semi-playfully, yet eerily aswell.<br /><br />Next onboard, are broken pianos rollocking on a pirate's ship.A woman ghost,(maybe named Mary Celeste?) wearing a white laced dress flayling in the wind, and shipmates are screaming as the ship goes down, beneath the psychotic waves.Pain.This is 'Horse Latitudes'.(Actually a sea-fearing expression, perhaps likening the sea's power to that of a horse).It can't possibly mean anything.It's merely a dream.No melody to be found, it is a poetry reading atop sound tapestry.'Moonlight Drive' is quite American, but hangs onto the album's vague experimental theme due to excessive guitar-neck slithery, like a hyper-active child insisting on expressing every impulse simultaneously.<br /><br />'People Are Strange', has arguably Morrison's best, most coherent lyrics.They're even cited in psychology text-books to describe inner symptoms of the global illness which is depression.City life lends itself to feelings of isolation.People are too rushed and enslaved to afford reassuring glances with each other as they're passing by.So, it's easy to feel alone and uncared for.'People Are Strange' is the soundtrack I have playing in my head in such circumstances, just as those confidently strutting down the city street would have 'Stayin Alive' by the Bee Gees as their soundtrack.(Cheesy, I know.But lets face it... if you're STRUTTING, you're already in a cheesy mood anyway).<br /><br />'My Eyes Have Seen You' rocks itself into the perimeter of passible normalcy.But, bizarre traces just adhere it to this albums rule; The days must remain strange.'I Can't See Your Face In My Mind' introduces a marimba(Central American) with slightly Japanese inclinations.A soft brushing keeps rhythm with this gentille, musical snail.'When The Music's Over' retains the first album's screatchy organ, and the ocean-deep bass-line is well worthy of the song's extenuous length.Its primal creepiness, drags the album home... clawing and screaming!days must remain strange.'I Can't See Your Face In My Mind' introduces a marimba(Central American) with slightly Japanese inclinations.A soft brushing keeps rhythm with this gentille, musical snail.'When The Music's Over' retains the first album's screatchy organ, and the ocean-deep bass-line is well worthy of the song's extenuous length.Its primal creepiness, drags the album home... clawing and screaming!

B00000099Y|5.0|This album changed my taste in music. I gradually started listening to it more and more. Soon I was hooked like a crack fiend(The CD Being the crack-rock, and my CD player the Pipe). With every listen I found something new that drew me in more.It was like a journey from beginning to end. After months of listening I gradually started listening less, and less. Enough of anything can get old. Now and then I still pop in this CD in and remember how truly great of a record it is. I think about how long ago it was released(1996) and it blows my mind how relevent it still is and how this album is just a classic. No matter how much my taste in music has changed to bands like opeth, killswitch engage(Alive or just....),  Chimaira... I just don't get sick of it or lose any appreciation for the amount of talent, time, and creativity put into this great realease by TOOL. If you are a new comer to the fella's pick this one up and I promise you will truly be thankful you did....And remember Think For Yourself, Question Authority.
B000067CPX|5.0|a great travel cd. an album about every good and bad speed bump one crosses in life. \\"i could die for you\\" a love song for those that you would die for... i know someone like that, and this is the first song that explains how i feel about the child in my life. \\"a minor thing\\" just ignor it all for they are just a minor thing. \\"warm tape\\" if you where ever in love but lost that love for a mistake you made(guilty as charged) this is the song for you, fun freindly sweet and sad. \\"dozed\\" still breaks my heart and if you listen you will know how i feel. \\"can't stop\\" a hero's rescue of an innocent who would prefere to fall... \\"tear\\" whether you believe in happy endings or not this song really makes a person feel good after hell breaks lose. the other songs are just as good, just these are my faves. this is the kind of cd you also listen to while you just look up at the clouds, or watch your kids play outside(do it and see what i mean, all there emotions and sounds match the songs).
B00008BXJG|5.0|The truth about the music industry, and in any art form, is that for a work of art to be successful enough to be career defining or genre defying, is that it must be released at the right time. With this in mind its easy to see why Back in Black is considered AC/DC's best album. The band was \\"almost\\" there, when suddenly they lost the very thing that made AC/DC great, Bon Scott. So all eyes turned on them for their next release, \\"Back in Black\\", doubting the new singer could ever match the late Bon Scott. When it proved a success, it was hailed as their masterpiece. The point is, circumstance made Back in Black their best selling album, not talent. Although Brian Johnson did pen some of AC/DCs greatest hits, he was never the snarling, lunatic genius that Bon Scott was. \\"Highway to Hell\\" is Bon Scott at his best, gleefully announcing his fate on the anthemic title track, and declaring his malevolent intentions on tracks like \\"Night Prowler\\", he was arguably AC/DCs greatest gift. Also, The bands groundshaking combination of Angus and Malcolm Youngs twin guitars have never been so crude. On this album they truly display their love for unflinchingly loud rock and roll. In short, their true masterpiece.

In the space of two weeks there were over 2,600 visitors to the page.  The page is no longer available 'cause I moved from WebTV to cable access.<br /><br />There is no doubt Dan Brown knows how to make a buck from the gullible.  In his latest book he illustrates his disdain for the intelligence of his books' readers.  In \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Dan writes on page 334 (paperback edition) as follows: 'And here too,' Langdon said, pointing now to the crowd of disciples near Peter.  'A bit ominous, no?'  Sophie squinted and saw a hand emerging from the crowd of disciples.  'Is that hand wielding a dagger?' 'Yes.  Stranger still, if you count the arms , you'll see that this hand belongs to ...no one at all.  It's disembodied.  Anonymous.'<br /><br />Bull! That hand holdig a knife belongs to Peter!

My webpage was devoted to this single subject with a photo of the sketch, and photos of me posing in the same pose as Peter to show that the reason that the hand looks disembodied is that the \\"Last Supper\\" has suffered irrevocable deterioration and the details showing the complete arm/hand have been lost.<br /><br />The worst part of this b.s. is that Director Ron Howard will probably include this bit of bull in his movie of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  Once a stupid idea takes hold, it gets worse, except to a few intelligent individuals such as me who has eyes to see, and a damn good brain!  If you want to be fooled, Dan Brown is the guy to do it.

So can Piscine Molitor Patel, the eponymous Pi, a Hindu Noah who survives Yann Martel's version of Herman Melville's \\"The Open Boat.\\"  Pi Patel navigates a voyage that has to be read to be believed.

How can one choose between one's life and the life of an animal?  Who survives?  Life of Pi is a fulfilling Life indeed.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Britney released her debut album a mere 5 years ago.  This leads to the question of why she would release a greatest hits compilation so early!  Well, one listen to this package and it's easy to see why.  In just five years, Britney has become a huge icon, put out four multi-platinum records and released an entire album's worth of hits (even Madonna released her Immaculate Collection after four studio albums)!  As far as Britney's musical catalogue is concerned, there is not one bad song on here.  All the ones you secretly sang along to while driving are here for your listening pleasure all in a flashy Britney-esque silver package, free of all the filler on the original albums.   <br /> <br />Also included are three previously unreleased recordings, including the first single, \\"My Prerogative\\".  That song, and the other two new songs, are really nothing grand.  Sure they sound good (closer to the songs on the Britney album rather than In The Zone), but they really don't meld well with the 14 hits.  And this record is more about the songs that made Britney's career anyway. <br /> <br />The Bonus CD is a nice little treat.  Four good remixes of songs from In The Zone (\\"Toxic\\", \\"Everytime\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Outrageous\\") as well as one really awful megamix.  But I say again, the album is more about the greatest hits.  If you're a Britney fan you probably already bought this.  If you're just a casual fan, there is no other record of hers to buy except this one.  It's a great, upbeat collection of modern bubble-gum pop that'll be everyone's guilty pleasure!
B00005B36H|5.0|please keep in mind, this is my first review...ever, this album happens to be what i am currently listening to, at this very moment, as i write this... <br /> <br />my musical tastes vary everyday, there are \\"spurts\\" where i  <br />stick to a certain sound or band for a few days. but this album never ceases to adhere to my current inclination for aural satisfaction. i received a copy of aenima in 1999/2000 and immediately developed an obsession for this band. then i got my mitts on this smorgasbord of aural pleasure and felt like i'd found the key to life, enlightenment. the song structure and composition of each track has clearly benefitted from the five years that it took for this album to hit the shelves. in the past, tool came across as angry to me. after hearing this album (numerous times)i look at tool as focused and aggressive, trying to make statements and get messages across with their music. they seem more driven. this album is so fluid that i feel i'm doing myself an injustice by not listening to it in it's entirety, but the songs are so brilliant and tightly composed that listening to one or two songs still satisfies my aural pallet. wonderful album. i can only imagine what tool will come up in the future. thinking about it just makes me giddy.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|This movie is based on the book by William Steig.  I have not read the book but the movie was a bit of a disappointment.  The story is quite simple and proceeds in a very linear manner.  There are no real challenges, no twists, no setbacks.  Everything just moves steadily forward. <br /> <br />Shrek, an Irish-accented Ogre with a Yiddish name, just wants to be left alone.  But suddenly his swamp is filled with fairy tale creatures who have been exiled by a local lord.  Shrek decides to see the Lord and set things straight.  To get his swamp back, Shrek agrees to rescue the princess that the Lord needs to become a king.  Romance ensues. <br /> <br />That's really it.  Not much more at all.  Some of the movie makes no sense at all.  At first we see the Lord's men paying rewards for the capture of fairy-tale creatures.  In the next scene all of these creatures are camped outside Shrek's door.  Did they escape?  Why pay for their capture if you are just going to let them loose?  Although there are many cameos from popular tales, only two actually get used.  One is the Gingerbread Man and the other is the Magic Mirror.  Why have all of these characters if they aren't used? <br /> <br />The movie is rated PG and contains plenty of bathroom and adult humor and some strong language.  I personally do not feel this is appropriate for young children but you can make up your own mind. <br /> <br />All in all I was quite disappointed.  The extras are okay although in the quiz the writers did not know that sulfur and brimstone are the same thing.  Ultimately, I am happy that I waited for a very good price before buying this one.
0393035158|5.0|Many of us have asked the question: are religious claims valid?  Harris adds the question: are they dangerous?  And he shows that some of them are.<br /><br />I'm sure we've all heard that it is impolite and improper to challenge the religious views of our neighbors.  The implicit logic is that religious views are not harmful, thus there is no need to save others from being exposed them, even if they are potential falsehoods.  The author points out that some of these views are indeed dangerous.  He cites suicide bombings and shows that most of them are directly linked to irrational religious views.  He reminds us of the absurdity of having multitudes of people killed over differing versions of religious stories.  And he reminds us that this situation could be changed: we've given up alchemy.  Maybe we can give up religious wars too.<br /><br />A good argument Harris makes is this: many religious views are arbitrary.  If we all forgot all human knowledge tonight, we'd start to reconstruct it.  We'd learn how to find food and shelter.  And we'd slowly relearn fundamentals of science and engineering.  But most of the details of religious dogma would be lost.  His conclusion is that what we hold sacred is considered sacred only because it was considered sacred yesterday.<br /><br />The author's examples of the dangers of religion include witch hunts and blood libels.  And he cites frightening polls showing that well over half of the people in some Muslim nations now find suicide bombing defensible.  He shows that the risk of a catastrophe involving nuclear weapons is great if we stay on the present course.<br /><br />Harris takes on a number of people who have expressed themselves on these risks.  He demolishes Ed Said's claim that the al-Qaeda terrorists are simply a minor group of lunatics to be compared with Jim Jones' cult.  And while he agrees with Paul Berman on some points, he quite reasonably disagrees with Berman's characterization of al-Qaeda as \\"nihilists.\\"<br /><br />Harris concedes many of Noam Chomsky's claims about America having done many bad things in its history.  But he smashes Chomsky's omnipresent implication that killing two people as collateral damage in a successful defence of hundreds of innocents is twice as bad as simply murdering one innocent person out of malice.<br /><br />I was glad to see Harris reject the \\"pacifist\\" refusal to fight against thugs.  Mahatma Gandhi recommended that Jews protest the German Nazis by mass suicides (he also recommended that the Jews accept all Arab demands involving Levantine land).  Harris points out that taken to such extremes, such refusal to oppose evil is simply dangerous.<br /><br />Another target of Harris' words are the moral relativists.  He asks if we can say that those who commit \\"honor killings\\" of shamed wives, sisters, and daughters really are showing less love for their womenfolk than do men who do not subscribe to such murderous behavior.  His answer is: of course we can.<br /><br />On issues of genocide and torture, Harris is quick to point out that if we are to judge these on moral grounds, we must judge on the basis of how much suffering we actually cause, not on how much we appear to cause.  Killing one person up close looks horrible.  Murdering a million people from afar by pushing a button may look much less vile.  And one widely reported death can draw far more worldwide concern than a million unreported ones.  But the one million deaths are still the more serious problem.<br /><br />Are we in the United States safe from the problems of monotheistic religion?  Not necessarily.  Harris reminds us that candidates who reject religion don't have a, um, prayer when it comes to getting elected.  And that is perhaps the only actual test many of our politicians face: there are no qualification exams to pass to let them run for office.  Harris also describes the religious nature of statements by people such as Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, and the effect of religious sentiments on national decisions involving stem cell research.<br /><br />Harris concludes that we need to dispense not with all mysticism and customs, but with faith.  And that can be done in a single generation \\"if parents and teachers would merely give honest answers to the questions of every child.\\"  To Harris, the most sacred thing is truth.  And the risks we face if we maintain the status quo include religious wars.<br /><br />This is a powerful and important book, and we ought to read it and recommend it to others.ng stem cell research.

B0002KVUKM|1.0|terrible.....boring.....painful to watch and just dragged on endlessly.  The best part of this movie was when it was over.  Forget this one..don't waste your money.  Wait for it to show up in the bargain bin.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I have been waiting for this to come out - I was there in Dallas for the festival, stayed in the same hotel as the artists and saw them milling about the entire weekend- <br /> <br />I have read the posted song listings that include \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" performed by Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton...  Well, I pick up my copy and lo and behold - it has been left out!!  With all the stellar performances that weekend, this one was left off the final pressing!  Jeff Beck must have nixed it at the last minute - what a disappointment!!  Best song of the entire show!! - BUMMED OUT IN HOUSTON.....
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I just watched this movie three times over the weekend, and I thought it was very, very good.  The morphing is excellent.  The way they morph the vampire brides from vampire to human and back was so smooth.  Same with the Werewolfs. <br />I like the \\"campy\\" parts, for example, \\"Igor, why must you torture the creature?\\"  \\"It's what I do!\\".  It's all meant to be taken \\"tongue-in-cheek\\". <br />I thought the actor who played dracula, did a good job with it.  When he yelled at his brides, he scared me too. <br />Good story, great action, great special effects.  I don't know as I would buy it, but it was sure worth the rental price.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is my favourite cd out of the two that they have. The songs are not as upbeat but still it keeps the same Simple Plan sound great for all ages and rockers! I love the cd!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This CD is a great collection of some of Shania's greatest songs. It's amazing how many hits she has made! I love the new songs on this CD, too and I'm sure they are also going to be hits!
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Where is Dust N Bones/Hair of the Dog/Mr.Brownstone? This <br />album is just a clear attempt to get some money. I can't <br />believe anybody would break down and buy this! The over <br />song \\"Knockin on Heavens Door\\" doesn't even belong! It <br />was one the subpar songs they did.
B000068GA4|5.0|I've rediscovered metal.  This is probably Danzig's best album.  Everything that makes them great is here-- bluesy, almost lumbering instrumentation; gutteral, but bluesy vocals from Glenn, and their trademark dark satanic overtones.  You may have heard \\"Mother,\\"  but this album is that vibe's logical conclusion.  If you buy only one Danzig album, this is the one.
B00000JBFW|4.0|I remember hearing \\"Knockin at your back door\\" as a 7 year <br />old kid and I knew right then that this would be one of my <br />favorites ever. The song I mentioned above is my favorite <br />with Perfect Strangers coming close. If you are new to Deep <br />Purple I wouldn't suggest this album... But if you just want <br />a solid rock album this wouldn't be a bad pickup.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Easily one of the best film scores of the year and worthy of an Oscar nomination, John Debney puts together a great score for the film. He is becoming one of My favorite film composers! The sound is incredible and the choir is fabulous! I recommend this score!
B000021YQV|1.0|This band suck and all 2 of their albums suck.  Anyone who can tolerate this garbage for longer than 5 minutes deserves a free copy of evanesence.(a band right on par with this joke of a group).  People who listen to this are going to be emabarassed two years from now when people finally realize that it is all pretty unlistenable.. I just can't believe there are people out there listening to this and actually saying \\"Yeah, man.. This Rocks.  This is great music!\\"  Thanks.  THere is no flow to the music and the singer sounds like Beavis freaking out.  For true genius and great songwriting, look no further than The Brian Jonestown Massacre.
B0002OERI0|5.0|In this day of blatant hypocrisy and oppression of freedom of speech, it isn't surprising to see these right-winged people take immediate offense to this album before listening to it, much less reading the lyrics. And it's not surprising to see people grow angry, probably resorting to destroying this fine album. But it isn't a stab at America. American Idiot focuses more on deeper problems. American's aren't idiots, necessarily, but there are some idiots in this country who either don't vote or they don't research before they cast a vote (that's why Bush got a second term!). And there are idiots who just don't care about the country and making peace with foreign affairs, thus making this country even more unsafe than before. Truly, just because you have \\"American Idiot\\" as the title or say that you don't agree with the president's actions, doesn't make you an anti-American. As Americans, we should all have a right to say what we feel, even if it is disagreeing with our governmental system.  <br /> <br />But, as for this album, I thought it was wonderful. Excellent! I bought it last Friday and it has become prime listening material for me. And those who haven't bought it seriously should go out RIGHT NOW and purchase it! You won't regret it! <br /> <br />I'm not an American Idiot any longer now that I got off my lazy butt and bought this. It's great!
0694524786|1.0|I got this from my local library and I had to stop it after less than 10 minutes. Michael York reads the story in a revoltingly syrupy voice that sounds as if he is reading to a mentally deficient infant. This may be a children's book but it has appeal to all ages and even children hate to be talked down to. Look for another recording and leave this one on the shelf.
B00000IPAX|4.0|ok guys before we go on lets get this straight. Blink sold out. Big time. We all know that. Well only the real blink fans would kow that not the 12 year old girls who dont knw what good taste in music is in the first place. Blink are a great band but there best days were a long time ago. Those dude ranch days were there best. but after that album they made so much money and spent all on production for this album. yeah it sounds great. but it aint punk. Blink WERE a great punk band now theyre a good pop band.  <br /> <br />Onto the album. Some great punk songs here but the songs are drowned in the over producing therefore losing the punkness. My favourite song is Mutt. Its just coincidental that the drumming in this is done by scott. Trav ur a great drummer, one of the best all time, but what the hell are u doing with blink. if u luv music so much why are u with blink? its all for the money for u trav. Blink has some great songs here. Whats my age again-Classic. One of the best. Also one of my fav videoclips.  <br /> <br />enema is a great album for blink fans- i dont think real punkers liek it at all but i recommend it for anyone. Enema will sit along with Dookie in one over the power punk pop albums of all time. 13 year old girls STAY AWAY u r the reason y blink has its reputation of being sissys
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie. I know there are some losers here that think this movie was dumb because it had little to no plot. I say so what. If you don't like it ... you suck! Especially that kid who said he was Pee Wee's twin. You are a loser!
B000003TA4|5.0|I think it's pretty silly how everyone is complaining about how Kurt Cobain was untalented, the guitar solos were so easy ... wake up.  There's alot more to music than shredding  blazing guitar solos so impossible that nobody can play them ... I actually appreciate the fact that even as a beginning guitar player, I can pick up a guitar and play some of this stuff.  It doesn't devalue the music one iota.  I'm a much more experienced drummer, and I could play these songs note-for-note in my sleep on the drums.  I could go on and on about how Virgil Donati or Dave Weckl would have been so much better on this album - but would they? <br />   <br />Memorable riffs ... cool lyrics ... definite melodies ... the ingredients are here.  This is a GOOD album. <br /> <br />This is very simple to prove:  ask 100 people on the street whether they've heard of Nirvana and whether they've heard of Allan Holdsworth, John McLaughlin, or Jeff Beck. Then tally up the results.  While just about anyone would agree that Holdsworth, McLaughlin, and Beck were miles beyond Kurt in terms technical ability and musical complexity (and most other guitar players too, for that matter), you will find that more people have heard of Nirvana than all the others put together.  What does that mean?  That the other guys are not virtuosos?  Absolutely not.  That people don't know good music?  Maybe, but much more likely it means sometimes you don't have to be the most technically advanced player ever to pick up your instrument to create music that people can enjoy and be moved by.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love starwars. I was at just the right age when it came out, to be totally blown away by the effects, storyline and the whole experience. I had the original release on VHS, and later got the digital enhanced version on VHS. Now - this set gives me a more permanent copy of the 3 movies, plus a whole DVD of background and an hour long show putting the whole phenomena in historical context. That's most likely my favorite part - as it more than anything else, takes me back to my childhood.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars then? Well - because this is the \\"new\\" version of Starwars - not the old and original one. I know George Lucas didn't like the original version completely - but that's the version I fell inlove with. When the original digitized version was first done, I remember the documentaries showing the difference. What's left is scenes with too much digitization - it takes away from the story, and looks like it's just there to show off.<br /><br />I would have apprechiated a documentary about the digitization too (at the very least) and the option of playing the original version without the addons.<br /><br />As you've noticed - I'm not describing the movies themselves. They are self-evident the best story ever told on the big silver screen. No doubt. It wasn't the technology or the special effects alone. It was the full and complete combination of a great story told perfectly. Of course it looks a bit crude with todays eyes - but that just makes it even more important and more interesting to learn about. And to keep for future references.<br /><br />The Trilogy is a documentary of a milestone in moviemaking. Any sci-fy buff out there (like me) should definately own this. And for that matter, so should everyone else. May the force be with you ....
B00006M183|3.0|I'll go track by track because I need to make it clear that while I still think Pearl Jam's the best band in the world, this album marks a step in the wrong direction, and one I hope the band doesn't plan on continuing. It's uneven, inconsistent, and hard to listen to all the way through. The songs I like might sound terrible to you, and vice versa. It's that weird. <br /> <br />1) Can't Keep. (8/10) One of the highlights. Think Ten's 'Release', only tenser and more urgent. Powerful, introspective take on the ethereal subject matter which defines Pearl Jam at their best. <br /> <br />2) Save You. (9/10) Straightforward rocker. Vintage Pearl Jam. A little similar to State of Love and Trust, but there's nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />3) Love Boat Captain. (10/10) Probably the best song on Riot Act. The emotions of the Rosklide tragedy take form in the most heartfelt song on the record (\\"Lost nine friends we'll never know/ two years ago today\\"). Beautiful when performed live. <br /> <br />4) Cropduster. (4/10) Momentum killer. Lyrically it's solid, but it's a boring riff for a band featuring Mike McCready. Also a live staple, for reasons I don't understand. <br /> <br />5) Ghost. (5/10) Picks it up a little from Cropduster, but still seems uninspired. Stone's got a good riff on this one, though. <br /> <br />6) I Am Mine. (6/10) Deserving first single, but it's got less depth and replay value than the band's older material. <br /> <br />7) Thumbing My Way. (10/10) Best lyrical work of the disc. Touching and passionate- \\"No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead/ I'm thumbing my way back to heaven.\\" Great song. <br /> <br />8.) You Are. (3/10) THUD. That was the sound of Riot Act's bottom falling out. This song just isn't any good. It sounds forced from every point of view. Lyrics aren't great, riff is sort of cheesy. <br /> <br />9.) Get Right. (5/10) Not bad, but very similar to Ghost. <br /> <br />10.) Green Disease. (7/10) The last appearanceof intelligent social commentary on the record. One of the better live songs from the album as well. <br /> <br />11.) Help Help. (2/10) Nearly unlistenable. I don't know what they're trying to do here. <br /> <br />12.) Bu$hleaguer. (0/10) It's all too obvious what they're trying to do here. Another reviewer said this song is \\"beneath' Pearl Jam, and I can't put it any better than that. Lyrical ambiguity can make songs interesting. This song lacks it. <br /> <br />13.) 1/2 Full. (5/10) A good 'getting back to nature' song, although the political overtones are a bit strong here, too. Riff is lifted directly from Ten's \\"Deep\\". <br /> <br />14.) Arc. (9/10) This short, a capella chant is described by Vedder as \\"a song of grief\\", another tribute to the Rosklide victims. It's not at all what you'd expect from the band, but it works pretty well. The statement made by performing this song regularly, but not including it on the official bootlegs, increases the band's connection with their live audience, which is a good thing. <br /> <br />15.) All or None. (5/10) The record ends on a refreshingly ambiguous note, but its lumbering and deliberate pace can be irritating. <br /> <br />Averages out to a little less than 6/10, which is where I'd put this record. I've come to expect so much better from Pearl Jam, I can't help but be let down by this. It's had two years and I've tried to let it grow on me, but it's still by far their worst studio effort to date.
B0002858YS|5.0|Despite what many others believe, The Killers do not sound like pop or &quot;retro&quot; music from the '80s.  The Killers are real musicians playing real instruments.  Hot Fuss is not an overly-produced or compressed album, it is the way it should be.  Flowers sings with soul, Stoermer pounds out the groove, Keuning intensifies and elaborates, and Vannucci leads the way.  This is a real rock band here.  The synthesizers are used where they are needed and they are in place of where the piano would go in a traditional rock band.  This is music you can dance to people - REAL ROCK &amp; ROLL.<br />I promise that if you listen to rock you will enjoy this album.  If you like pop or retro, this will not satisfy - because it simply isn't poppy or retro.  This is Rock...the way it should be.
B0000028UK|5.0|As a Pearl Jam fanatic, the question of which studio album is the best is a constant question for me. Is it the wall-to-wall angst of Ten? The existential self-exploration of No Code? The Matt Cameron-dominated Binaural? The hits collection Vitalogy? <br /> <br />No, no, no, no. Vs. is definitive Pearl Jam, plain and simple. It's sold more records than any other album without music video support in the MTV era. It's got one of their most recognizable songs, Daughter. It's got their best statements on the subjects of politics (Glorified G), social injustice (W.M.A.) and rock stardom (Blood). It's got songs that would stand the test of time to become their most enduring live cuts (Go, Rearviewmirror). Most importantly, the incredibly high standard set by their debut, Ten, is surpassed with consistency and sincerity. The weakest point, Rats, is still a good song on its own merits- it just falls between RVM and Small Town on the tracklist, thus sounding a little stupid. <br /> <br />While I can safely recommend any of Pearl Jam's first six studio albums, I feel most strongly about this one. It's a classic.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|All Shania's biggest hits are here, and I must admit it's nice to have them all on one CD. However, they made a huge mistake by using \\"Come On Over\\" and leaving out \\"You've Got A Way.\\"
B000002BYD|4.0|I think Yield's tendency to be overrated had a lot to do with the way music was going in 1998. When No Code came out, Pearl Jam was still arguably the biggest band in the world. By shunning the spotlight and making a pair of rather self-indulgent records (for lack of a better term), PJ endeared themselves to anyone who wanted to consider themselves fans of the rock pariah.  <br /> <br />Now I'm not here to criticize the band's fan community, because I am a part of it- but Yield is clearly the second album of the \\"we'll do what we want, screw the media and critics\\" phase of the band's career. With No Code it was still raw, fresh, and meaningful. On Binuaral they perfected it. Yield is just weird for the sake of weird, and you can tell the band doesn't exactly know where they're trying to go.  <br /> <br />The best song- and possibly the band's best song to date- is Given to Fly, a jesus metaphor with meaning and substance. Other highlights are the rockers, Brain of J, MFC, and Do the Evolution. Some of the other songs, like No Way, Pilate, Red Dot, and Push Me Pull Me, are just deliberately difficult. Others, like Wishlist and All Those Yesterdays, are all the more jarring due to their simplicity because they sound out of place on a very complex record. The result is a very disjointed piece of work that reminds me of the 2004 Chicago Cubs- a number of excellent individual pieces that just don't click as a team. <br /> <br />I should point out that a lot of these songs sound fantastic live, especially Given to Fly and MFC. The studio versions just don't do them justice, simply put.
B0006284JQ|5.0|People always think WTF when they find out Brit's got a greatest Hits CD coming out, but in all honesty, once you read the tracklisting memories come whoosing back to you and then it hits you.

B00004T8RK|5.0|I don't understand why Pearl Jam fans don't recognize this album as one of the best. If it doesn't match up with the epics Vs. and Ten, it's got to be considered superior to the departures of Yield and Riot Act. There's more hard rock on here than people give it credit for. Insignificance, in particular, is Binaural's entry into the pantheon of Pearl Jam rockers. Great lyrics about war and politics without being too deliberate or over-the-top about it, and Mike McCready as always is there to save the day. God's Dice, Grievance and Breakerfall are also pretty hardcore rock by Pearl Jam standards. <br /> <br />The album might shine even brighter on the slower numbers. Light Years and Thin Air are Stone Gossard showcases with beautiful lyrics. Of the Girl might be the most experimental song on Binaural, and it's a success. For once, lyrical simplicity works in Pearl Jam's favor here, as the song is nothing more than a frank and honest look at obsession. Nothing as it Seems, a song bassist Jeff Ament wrote, ironically has one of the best Mike McCready solos EVER, not to mention the sort of introspection you only get from Pearl Jam. The most impressive song, if not the best Binaural has to offer, is Sleight of Hand. It's an exploration of a life, a boring life, but done with transcendent detail and passion. It's the sort of song you need to listen to at least 10 times before you begin to understand just how impressive it is- and then, it gets better with every listen. <br /> <br />So many people who say Pearl Jam's last good album was Yield probably haven't even listened to Binaural. This review won't change those peoples' minds, but if you've read this far, just give it a try. You will not be disappointed.
B000002ILG|4.0|I first discovered White Lion when I saw the video for Wait in 1987 on MTV, about the same time Welcome To The Jungle by G&R was becoming huge. It was a little tempting to write WL off as a pretty boy hair metal band but I liked that song. I was very pleased when I got the album. Vito's guitar playing is melodic and his guitar tone is great. Mike's vocals are very emotional. My favorites are Wait, Lady Of The Valley (cool riff), Tell Me (great feel good vocals), and When The Children Cry. There is not really any song that I dislike on this album. I give it 4.5 stars.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I went to the screening of `Finding Neverland' and found it to be a wonderful movie! Rarely do we get to watch a movie in which the story is filled with so much fantasy, imagination, and spirit that will keep us entertained throughout the movie.  <br /> <br />The story starts off with James Barrie, a Scottish playwright whose most recent work is a failure. One day in the park, he meets Sylvia Davies, a widow, and her four boys and strikes up a conversation with him. Little by little, he becomes closer to them, and gets inspired to write a new play, one that would be one of the greatest classics of our time. <br />The film focuses mainly on Barrie's relationship with the Davies family, and by viewing small things such as the children's behavior, how he created Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, and added the pirates and the Indians to create a magical masterpiece. <br /> <br />Marc Forster, the director of this movie (who also directed Monster's Ball) gives us magic in this story inspired by the life of James Barrie, the author of `Peter Pan'. Johnny Depp acted flawlessly as J.M.Barrie. His expressions (along with the accent) were perfect, and his performance laudable. The rest of the cast, including Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie also acted incredibly well. However, I was really amazed by the performance of Freddie Highmore, the young boy who acted as Peter Davies in the movie, especially towards the end of the movie.  <br /> <br />I think this is one of the best movies to be released this year. If you loved watching movies like `Big Fish', you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br />
B000001DQI|5.0|Hearing this cd brings back great memories of the 70s, the best decade for music ever (maybe the best decade period, minus the fashion of course). This album has several Elton John classics like Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, Candle In The Wind, and the title track. There are other lesser known classics like Funeral For A Friend and Sweet Painted Lady. How can you go wrong with 17 good songs on one cd?! If you get one EJ album this should be the one!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is a great album.  I loved the first one but I really love the second one.  It's fun, it's up beat and I highly reccommend it.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|Seth Green is a hugely miscast embarassment as jaded, junkie drag queen James St. James.  His annoyingly nasal on-the-verge-of-catching-a-cold vocal delivery is headache inducing and after the first five minutes of watching Party Monster I almost shut it off because of it.  Culkin isn't much better.  It's good to see him acting again in such out of character roles from the fairly wholesome fare he used to do. He's absolutely believable as a sociopath but barely passable as vengeful flamboyant Michael Alig.  This film comes across as Green and Culkin playing dress-up in front of a camera.  The story is horrific and true but the movie veers off into the mundane and lasts a bit longer than necessary.  Worth seeing for stellar performances by Wilmer Valderrama (of  That 70s Show) as Superstar DJ Keoki, Wilson Cruz (of My So Called Life) as the ill fated drug dealer Angel and Marilyn Manson as drag queen Christina.  Outside of that I would recommend renting the \\"shockumentary\\"  Party Monster instead for real behind the scenes footage and interviews of the actual participants.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|Im not a richard gere or a jennifer lopez fan but my fiance dragged me into this movie.  I found that I actually enjoyed it.  Richard Gere is a lawyer who seems to me missing something in his life and notices Jennifer lopez in a dance school window.  His curiosity in piqued and he goes in and begins to find that he likes to dance ballroom and other styles and eventually is in a dance contest.  Jennifer lopez is a teacher who lost in a big dance tournament in England and has lost her partner and she is burned out.  Seeing that Gere is really enjoying himself, brings back her flame to dance competetively again. <br /> <br />It is a very nice story, well done in my opinion. The supporting cast is very good.  I really enjoyed Stanley Tucci who is closet latin dancer, Gere discovers this while taking the lessons and there is some funny scenes with Tucci and Gere. <br /> <br />Susan Sarandon is also in this movie as Geres wife who is wondering why her husband is coming home late and her efforts to find out why. <br /> <br />Like I said in the title, I went in relucantly but found that I had a enjoyable time watching this movie
B000003EQE|5.0|This was my first Sebelius experience and because of this album I haven't been satisfied with any other. The experience was overwhelming.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I was surprised when \\"Tootsie\\" made #2 on the American Film Institute's poll of the top 100 comedies of all-time; pretty good for a film that 'doesn't get noticed anymore.' I'm not sure if I'd rank it that high, but I do agree, it's a great, almost perfect comedy. There's a lot of movies built around a similar premise of a man trying to impersonate a female, but what makes \\"Tootsie\\" stand out is how it never gets too low-brow and how it explores every worthy nuance of that premise. <br /> <br />It's pretty amazing how well this film works as both popcorn entertainment and as a feminist classic. Lots of pictures have tried to be both, like \\"What Women Want,\\" but fail miserably because they're either not funny/entertaining at all or really shallow or even dumb. The comedy never lets up in \\"Tootsie,\\" but Michael's (Dustin Hoffman's character) growing sympathy and understanding of what it's like to be a woman is always there. I was pretty surprised at how much this picture meant to Hoffman when he interviewed for it on CBS. A surprisingly emotional interview, he basically said that before the picture, he was 'brainwashed' at how he was supposed to perceive women, and coming out of it, he felt guilty for having ignored/shortchanged/misjudged so many people before because of that mindset he used to have. <br /> <br />I don't want to ruin any jokes, so I'll just repeat that it's a very funny picture. All the performances are excellent, especially Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange. The only real complaint I have is the music, which feels a bit too dated. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, this was released fairly recently, and it seems to be a good transfer from an excellent print. You get an anamorphic picture, which is great if you have a widescreen set, and there's a new 5.1 mix but it's not exactly a sophisticated soundtrack. It's also a two-sided disc, full-frame on one side, widesceen on the other, but each side only has about 4.1 GB of data, meaning the resolution isn't going to be great, and it shows in the long-shots and even medium shots where the facial details don't seem very defined. No real extras, which is unfortunate because even if they can't get Pollack, Hoffman, Lange, Garr, Murray, etc. to do commentary, there's plenty of available material that would've been nice (like Hoffman's emotional interview). Unless there's a 25th anniversary edition in the works for 2007, this is probably your best bet on home video.
0385486804|2.0|After reading Kraukaur's \\"Into Thin Air\\" I was looking forward to reading this one. The novel in it's presented form, however, just doesn't work. The fundamental problem being that Kraukaur (and all the rest of us) just can't know the circumstances and the mind-frame of the main character. This is problematic as the intrigue surrounding the tidbits we do know is considerable and almost begs to be written about: A young man turns his back on society, gives away all his belongings, and marches off into the Alaskan wilderness only to turn up dead a short time later from apparent starvation. <br />The author of course realizes his disadvantage but instead of abandoning the project (or even scaling it down), he resorts to padding the (still-paltry) novel with backstory about the main character which has little to nothing to do with \\"true adventure\\"- Kraukaur's forte. <br />More annoying still, the author adds two chapters about one of his own climbing outtings, which while interesting enough, have nothing to do with the story at hand and would have been better off left as a short story (despite his attempt to relate the two via 'male adolescent longing' or some such thing). And that's the problem in the end. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't pump enough air into \\"Into the Wild\\" to turn it from a magazine story into a viable novel. Oh yeah, back away from the thesaurus Jon...
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|but DAMN she has made some fun music! Not to say that Shania hasn't recorded a few duds over the last decade, but when she's good ~ the songs are always catchy and infectious.

B0006284JQ|4.0|When Britney came out in 1999 with the album Baby One More Time, she was a breath of fresh air with her catchy dance tunes like Baby One More Time, You Drive Me Crazy,  and Sometimes. Her followup CD included hits like Oops I did it again, Lucky and Stronger.<br /><br />Britney has had fewer hit songs since her second album in my opinion.  I really like the song Boys from the Austin Powers soundtrack and the autobiographical song I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman.<br /><br />All of Britney's older songs are excellent and they are included on this CD.  However, I think some of these songs are too recent to be considered on a greatest hits album like Toxic and her duet with Madonna Me Against the World.  My Prerogative is not very good.  I had a hard time understanding the words to her newer songs to be honest.  I enjoyed listening to about half of the tracks on this CD.
B0000062GE|5.0|this is one of the best albums of ALL TIME by ANY artist. its one of those rare albums where nearly all of the tracks are AWESOME SONGS.  <br /> <br />get this. it is definitely Stabbing Westward's best album by far.  <br /> <br />some of the best tracks: oh wait. all of them? except maybe 10-12 which are quieter and slower. and the first title track is kinda meh but its more just filler than anything else.  <br /> <br />GO!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is one of the best female singers around.  This CD has most of her hits.  My favorite song is Man! I feel like a Woman.  This song really rocks and gets me going.  Another highlight track for me is the song That Don't Impress Me Much.  I love the lyrics to this song very much, because I think what really matters is a person's personality and character and not what they have in terms of material possessions.  I also like the song I'm Going Getcha You Good too from the smash album UP.<br />Shania Twain sings the best love songs.  I especially enjoy the songs You're Still The One, and At This Moment.  These are very beautiful songs that were big hits on both the country and pop charts.  Shania's voice is heartfelt and sincere on her love songs.  I think that is part of her huge appeal.<br /><br />Shania sings a new duet entitled Party for Two with newcomer Billy Currington on this album.  This is a very playful and flirty song that I loved.  She also sings this song with Sugar  Ray front man Mark McGrath.  I enjoyed both versions of this song.<br /><br />The song Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under is a real crowd pleaser at her concerts.  It is a very lively song that gets the audience on their feet.  This CD is an excellent greatest hits album.  I recommend this CD to anyone who loves good music.
B000084T18|2.0|Not good.  If your the kind who likes every other word to be expressed with vulgarity, then this is the album for you.  There is really no talent and musically not fulfilling, I ended up giving the cd away because I was so unimpressed, something I never do.  The G-Unit cd is better.
B00005JKG7|2.0|I just watched this movie last night because I was in the mood for a scary flick.  I wish I would have not bothered.  The plot is kind of slow, and very predictable.  The acting is pretty bad as well (unless you really like Adrian Barbieu with a overly-breathy voice).  Not scary, not entertaining. Boring, boring, boring.  I can't imagine what people who give this a high rating see in this film.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was the first novel I read by by Jane Austen couple of years back while doing my graduation. And this novel made me an ultimate fan of Jane Austen's writing. Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.<br /><br />Highly recommended! :-)
0375507256|4.0|This was a great book.  While the middle of the book slows down quite a bit with thick accented dialogue, the overall feel of the novel is quite outstanding.  The entire cast of characters are connected not by events, but by themes of civility, morality, etc.  This is a great read for anyone that wants to think a little bit while enjoying a truly good book.  Best book I've read this season.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|At the drive in is one of the best bands of all time. This is one of there best CDs of all time. It amazes me how much music sucks now. Everyone has to join a bandwaggon and sound like crap, or everyone else. These guys didnt follow any bandwaggon, or sound like anyone else. This CD is one of the best things ever to happen to me. They changed music forever. And Id give up anything to see them get back together. But god knows thats not going to happen. <br /> <br />With Cedric's mean souring voacls and Jims and Omars amazing Riffs, Relationship of Command is full of listen over again and again tracks. Not to mention the unbelibale lyrics. Relationship of Command is a Must HAVE. <br /> <br />I deffinitly reccommened this CD to any music listener. If you listen to punk/indie/emo/rock/classic rock, or antyhing
B0006284JQ|5.0|A very nice hits package from Britney Spears. You don't have to like Britney to appreciate that her hits album is a step above those put out by most entertainers, even if it's only theoretical appreciation.  <br /> <br />What's particularly nice about this album is that it isn't the same-old formula of the hits plus one new cover. There is a new cover here- the already-famous \\"My Perogative\\", Britney's very good cover of Bobby Brown's hit- but there are also two new original songs (well, new to North America anyway- one of them was on an import). Besides that, there are three songs from previous albums- 'Crazy' from '...Baby One More Time', and 'Boys' and 'Overprotected' from 'Britney'- that appear here in their more-famous non-album, remixed video versions. There are three singles missing- the \\"split singles\\" ('From the Bottom of My Broken Heart' and 'Born to Make You Happy')from 'Baby' and 'Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know' from 'Oops!...I Did It Again'. BtMYH is the only real loss; all three are ballads, and ballads tend to highlight the limits of Britney's voice. They're on the albums, at any rate. <br /> <br />As for all the haters: No, she isn't a great singer. And you may be right about this being the end of her career. It seems that she want to take an extended break at the least, and may well be unofficially retiring. You never can tell. Regardless, she HAS done so on her own terms.  <br /> <br />Even if she's done, the woman who wrote the liner notes for this hits album said it best: \\"There is perhaps no great testament to Spears' cultural significance- no beter symbolic flipping-of-the-bird to naysayers- than the sheer existence of this album\\". Britney Spears has lasted four more albums and four more years than the naysayers of 1999 predicted. What have YOU done with the past five years? By any remotely objective measure, her career has been a triumph for her.
B00005JLF5|3.0|Hey - I'm looking to see if anybody has purchased the Asian import versions of DS-9 posted on Amazon.  They are really cheap, as compared with the US versions.  If someone has purchased one of these sets, can you post a review so we know whether this is a viable way to own these shows, or whether it is a rip-off?  (I've bought Asian disks before and they are a \\"crap shoot\\", as far as quality goes.  But if these are \\"official\\" released versions, then the quality of the package and media might be good.)  Thanx.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|plenty of good songs and a long play list.some groups come out with a greatest hits but only to find ten or twelve songs on it.i can't believe this cd didn't have \\"what made you say that\\",and \\"dance with the one that brought you\\".still a good greatest hits collection though.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I couldn't be happier with the results of the November 2 election. Primarily, the election gave four more years to President George W. Bush.  But, there's also the side benefit of laughing at Michael Moore (once again) and those who wear their nonsensical hatred for President Bush and America on their sleeves.   <br /> <br />Moore's phony \\"documentary\\" is nothing more than propaganda and disinformation.  He has a perverted hatred for President Bush and the United States, which is his only political philosophy and motivator.  Thankfully his philosophy of lies was soundly rejected on November 2 by the American people.  I hope Moore chokes on it. <br /> <br />Moore should seek professional help.  Sitting through the first five minutes of this anti-American hate-filled garbage made me ill. <br /> <br />There are so many lies and fabrications in this film it's hard to know where to begin.  From September 11 (it wasn't George Bush who gave clearance to the Bin Laden family to leave the U.S. - it was Moore's hero Richard Clarke); to the images of happy Iraqi children under Saddam Hussein who are then attacked by the evil United States - it's all pure fiction. Only a moron like Michael Moore could argue that Iraqi's were happy under the rule of Saddam Hussein. <br /> <br />Moore's hatred for George W. Bush is intertwined with his hatred for the United States and everything this country stands for.  While promoting this film in Europe, Moore said Americans were fat and lazy (he must be including himself) and look to invade and take over \\"weaker\\" and \\"defenseless\\" countries.  What nonsense.   <br /> <br />Plus, who is Michael Moore to criticize George Bush's family for their wealth -- Moore has made MILLIONS off this trash. Despite his claims, Moore is not a \\"man of the people.\\" <br /> <br />It's also interesting to note that Osama Bin Laden uses the same talking points against President Bush and the U.S. as Moore does in this film.  I wonder where Bin Laden gets his materialfrom -- that's right, fat Michael Moore.   <br /> <br />This film is pure garbage.  People like Michael Moore don't deserve any American's hard-earned money or respect.   <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|Maybe it was just that i saw the movie 3 times before reading the book, and then only read it once, but i thought the movie was better. i liked how they added events to their teen years to make the story more complete. i also liked that they added more to their time in the nursing home and brought things from their past like the piano playing. i have mixed feelings about them adding the part about her mother have a similar situation with a guy that worked at the lumberyard. it kinda explains why she acted the way she did, but it seemed a little too perfect. i also think it was a little too perfect that they died together at the end, but i find the book ending really gross. <br /> <br />i really liked ryan gosling and rachel mcadams. i watched ryan when he was the mickey mouse club years ao and i liked rachel's other movie mean girls. she is so pretty too i can't believe she is 28.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie literally left me feeling depressed for days after seeing it. Not only for the events that took place in this movie, but for the fact they are so tangible and real. Anyone who says the violence in this movie is excessive and exploitive is too sheltered and obviously hasn't met anyone like the characters in this movie.  <br /> <br />The spinning camera angles in this movie do a good job of conveying the sense of bleakness and the atmosphere of gloom and tension of the events in this movie. As the tension lessens towards the beginning of the film it seems the camera seems to stabilize more.  <br /> <br />I think Gaspar No did us a favor by showing us the events in this film in reverse, I don't think it would have been easier to abosrd the final climax of this film very well if I had time to actually get attached to the main protagonists in this film. It also gives you a different perspective of the characters seeing them pushed to their limits first before you see them in a more every day collected state of mind. <br /> <br />I guess my only real complaint is that the last minutes of this film fealt like they were going to give me a seizure.  <br /> <br />This is nihilism defined. This movie will move you in some way after seeing it.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Like, ohmygosh, Britney is just so the \\"It Girl\\" of the moment, I'm all atwitter.  She is so flawlessly perfect and talented, I cannot stand to listen to anyone else anymore.  Celine, Shania, Barbra, and even Maria Callas (look her up, kids) pale in comparison next to my Britney.  She sings so beautifully with a full vocal range that brings tears to my eyes.  She comports herself with such dignity and class.  And she is so very misunderstood.  I mean, don't you see that the 72-hour marriage, the gum-spitting, and all that drinking and smoking were merely attempts to broaden her fan base?  How else can one reach the Nascar crowd when one has such class and glamour?  By her very nature, Britney is so above all that but, as you can see, she willingly reaches out to the lower classes.  She's a modern-day Evita...doing what she can to include the little people.  If she continues, I can confidently see some sort of Philantropy prize in her future.  It's so comforting to know that millions of young girls (and some boys) all over the world see her as a role model.  For that is exactly what she is.  Who knows, maybe when her entertainment career is done (though I do shudder at the thought of a world without musical entertainment from Britney), she'll forgo delving into ancient cryptic religions (like her mentor) and embark on a long rewarding journey as a goodwill Embassador for the United States.  The world is a much better place with Britney.  Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Spears for having given the world a true muse.  Even the Greek gods couldn't have done better. <br /> <br />It's time for my medication now...
B0006284JQ|5.0|Stone Coldest Justice \\"Meanest SOB from Texas\\", what do you care what Britney does?? <br />You're being an idiot by doing exactly what Britney points out in the title track in this album. If you don't like her, you think that's going convince people to sway their opinions too?? Prejudiced people like this are exaclty like those who disrespect Michael Jackson and many other overly famous people. These famous people are like this because of stupid b***ards like you pointing out all the bad stuff about them. But really, is it any of your business. No, just listen to the music and get over yourself because it's embarrasing.  <br /> <br />I bet you haven't even bought this album, the point in a review is so that you are saying what you feel about the product you have bought. <br /> <br />I don't like Robbie Williams or David Bowie but I don't go around complaining about how much I hate them, frankly I care not to care. So should you. <br /> <br />Onto another point, I'm not a fan of Britney's but I still very much like her music and her... sometimes. I think that she has some great songs... I like practically all of the songs on this album. <br /> <br />I'll give it a 5 :)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|thirteen step is like one of the most beautiful albums of all times, this album is better than mer de noms, at least for me, once you get inside of it it gets adicted, i havent heard something as good as this in a long time! my favorite songs are, \\"the noose\\" just simply perfect, one of my favorite songs of all times, listen to it, you`ll see, \\"blue\\" also a great song as well as \\"package\\" to be honest every single song its amazing, a must have for all the music lovers,apc has done it again!
B0006284JQ|5.0|No matter what the haters say, Britney IS the best singer out today. Her songs, preformances, and career are absolutly AMAZING! She is one of the most talked about celebrities in the world. I hate that she is leaving for a couple of years, but people have to realize that she is a flesh and blood human being just like us. She deserves a break. In the past six years, she has changed the face of music as we know it. Being that she is only 23 years-old and has been in the music business for only six years, it is astounding that she has a greatest hits album! I look forward to the new Britney in a couple of years. \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" is a true testament of what a great artist she really is. Contrary to what people think, she will be back and better than ever!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is a GREAT cd! Everyone should go out and buy a copy or two. The guys did so much better on this album.The songs have more of a rock sound to them. What you hear on the cd is exactly what you hear when you see them live. On the song \\"Untitled\\", they did a great job with the music. And on \\"Welcome to my Life\\", it seems as if they followed a kid aroung for one day and wrote about how the kid felt. This cd can still relate to people. Again they did a great job. Keep up the good work!
B0002SROSQ|5.0|There is no musician on Earth who is better suited for releasing a double album than Nick Cave.<br /><br />Cave, who has always presented two sides of himself: the snarling man seeking revenge, or the introspective man seeking redemption, has used these sides to his advantage and has released one of the best album in the entire catalogue of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.<br /><br />As others have said, one disk is more manic in its energy and the other is more laid back.  However, both contain Cave's wit and excellent song writing, making it hard to pick a favorite of the two.<br /><br />The Bad Seeds, who have always provided such a powerful element that matches Cave's voice, have been joined by the London Community Gospel Choir, who add even more substance to the music.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the best release of 2004.
B00063MBU8|5.0|What an amazing growth for this band! Don't get me wrong... I absolutely loved their debut- it got me hooked on the band. But this sophomore album is definately a step in the right direction. My favorites... <br />Shut Up: One of those songs you have to blast in your car.  <br />Perfect World: About losing someone you love... very good. <br />Untitled: Definately not something I would have expected from Simple Plan, but I LOVE it! It's just... amazing. You have to hear it.  <br /> <br />This is just one of those cds you can listen to straight through... There's no need to skip any song on this cd. You'll love them all!

B00005B534|4.0|I was expecting a real major breakthrough after reading so many favorable reviews. However, I honestly couldn't find anything absolutely original here except for the highly complex and amazingly beautiful drum structures played by Dirk Bruinenberg. To me, the album sounded almost identical to Symphony X, but without soul, melody and musical texture characteristic in the prog/power metal genre.     Overall, I rate this 9.5/10 for overall musicianship (drummer Dirk Bruinenberg gets 10+!), but only 7/10 for composition and originality. Good music is not about how many notes you can play at a time.    David Readman's voice is flat. The guitar sound is almost a copy of Yngwie's, although Stephen Forte's composing abilities are much better than Malmsteen's. Remember: the best lead guitar solos are the ones one can sing along with. Lastly, the keyboards sound totally computer generated, fake and without feel.     Something very unique about Sanctus Ignis is the spectacular performance of drummer Dirk Bruinenberg (Elegy / Consortium Project / Rondat). I mean, how can anybody come up with those thunderous and imaginative double bass beats, is beyond me. The fast tempos are often offset by masterfully crafted slower patterns. Bruinenberg's drum lick repertoire and odd timing bag of tricks is endless. Nevertheless, his best stuff can be heard with Elegy, not here. Elegy to me is (was?) a much better band.    Most reviews here highlight Forte's guitar performance. However --for a change-- it is very important to acknowledge the astonishing level of drumming accomplished by Bruinenberg. This album is a must for any drummer or musician willing to learn how to push the envelope into un-chartered territory. Get his stuff from Elegy (sadly, a very underrated band)... their music is in a league of their own.
0804115613|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe has been a favorite movie for many years. Earlier this year I finally got around to read the book as well, and was not disappointed at all. The story is similar, of course, to the movie, but the book gives lots of moving, touching and funny details which are lost in the movie.<br /><br />Evelyn is a sad middleaged woman, who feels her life is empty and dull, and she is not impressed at first when she meets the old Ninny in a nursing home. Ninny starts telling Evelyn about her life in a small rural Southern town, and while Evelyn does not care at first, she soon becomes interested in all the people Ninny tells her about.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth in time, from the early 1930'es to our day. We hear about the friendship between two very strong women, Idgie and Ruth, and all the people they know in the little town Whistlestop. Idgie and Ruth owns the town cafe, and more than once it is subtly hinted that they have a [...] relationship. A detail, by the way, left out of the movie.<br /><br />The story also touches and deals with other subjects like slavery, racism, poverty but also love, faith, friendship.<br /><br />It is a wonderful history that will make you both laugh and cry, and I cannot recommend it enough.
B000065K5G|5.0|This movie is really good.  <BR>I understand people being unsatisfied if they have read the novel, (which I have not), but it is so well done as a movie on its own, that I would buy it and recommend it any day to a girl with a love for a good romance &amp; appreciation for Jane Austen style movies.<br />Loved the filming... beautiful shots, lovely acting,<BR>You'll appreciate the cinematography for sure.<br />Overall, one of the best romances I've seen in my life.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Not only is she the best selling country female artist of all time, has the highest selling album by a female of any genre of all time, is the only artist in history with three consecutive 10+ million diamond awards, but she simply writes great, infectious music that transcends all musical boundries. She manages to not only keep her music upbeat, but allows us to see into her soul, the soul of a positive and talented artist. This is a definate must for any music lover!
B000065K5G|5.0|Though I haven't read that book and do not have the qualms the other commenters here have in regards to the accuracy,  when I saw this movie I was floored.  The acting is excellent, and the filming breath-taking.<br />  The cinematography is beautiful.  The way a simple expression of Fanny Price is captured pulls you into all the emotions she's feeling in her position as a poor cousin in her wealthy uncle's family's house.  I thought it was a great movie... definitely a great movie to own and watch multiple times... if you like a good romance with substance to the story.<br />  I am such a fan... one of my favourite romance movies.  Goes down in my top 10.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield is one of the most dynamic and realistic cop shows I've seen. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), is  a corrupt, mafia-style cop. His gang of thugs, brutalize L.A., and at the same time keep the peace. Mackey pulls no punches. He's bad. But its a good kind of bad. At least a kind of bad you want to watch. &#60;Grin&#62;.<br /><br />Office dynamics between the dirty cops and the 'straight-shooters' on the force occasionally blur to produce interesting dynamics. In particular, I felt sorry for Julian, who seems one of the most 'human' characters on the show. Dutchboy and his partner are interesting. The only character I don't like? The female cop Danny(Julian's parter) and Vic's occasional girlfriend. Its pretty sad that she is continually fooled by Vic...Sorry, and this lady wants to be a Sergeant? Vic treated Julian terribly and who does she side with? Sorry...Danny annoys me. She's pretty dim, and considering she's one of the two main female characters on the show, I hope she's replaced for someone with a brain AND a spine.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great series. Sure to delight fans of Police Drama. Vic Mackey is a guy you love to hate.
B00005JMJG|5.0|i really don't know what to say about this movie.  it blew me away.   <br />i've had mixed feelings about the director (i liked being john...however you spell it, quite a bit, but i didn't care for adaptation at all).   <br />he's back on my good side. <br />some very strange things happen in this movie, and unlike adaptation, you don't have to watch it like you're reading a research article to understand it.   <br />pick it up and be weirded out.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I've read the track list and Led Zeppelin does not appear on this DVD set. Why do you think, \\"Bob Geldof\\", that this concert is sold on Ebay as a bootleg? People wanted to see the first comeback of Led Zeppelin since the death of John Bonham. It's absurd that this DVD is even being released without the Jimmy Page/Robert Plant footage. Your not getting my money Geldof.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie blew me away.  It's one of those rare gems that takes you by surprise when you think Hollywood can only produce the blockbuster or the over marketed piece of trash. It's an interesting dance between love story and science fiction. Jim Carrey is brilliant with his ability to blend his characters pretentiousness with his puppy dog like meekness. His love for Kate Winslet's character is totally believable, and you desperately don't want him lose her. Winslet is outstanding as always.  She plays her role beautifully as the attractive yet troubled eccentric.  In the beginning, their relationship seems to be a quagmire, the kind so wrought with difficulties that it is certain to fail. But as we watch through Jim Carreys characters mind, we see that there is much more to it.  We see that relationships are made up of many ups and downs, likes and dislikes, that love is not perfect, but it does not have to be.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have to say that to me, this CD is a return to the good old days. It reminds me of her first three efforts with just a touch of \\"The Memory of Trees\\" (Not that \\"The Memory Of Trees\\" was really that bad). I'm really glad to see her return to what made her shine. <br />
B00063MBU8|1.0|If this is what receives 5 stars with hundreds of reviews, while excellent, talented bands go unnoticed, then the end is coming and all that is left will be middle school, pink punk horse crap.  Once again Simple Plan has put out a wonderful album with music about as punk as New Kids on the Block.  With lyrics even more 'simple' minded than the last CD, Simple Plan has seriously passed my expectations... They're even worse now. Maybe I'm being too harsh. I'm sorry, SP fans. Wait, no I'm not.
B0000541AM|5.0|As a New York kid, some movies just bring back how it all once was.  This movie is one of them as well as Taxi Driver, Saturday Night Fever and The Goodbye Girl. <br /> <br />While it's true that NY wasn't as decrepit as this movie portrays, it was very close.  I remember blocks upon blocks in Bklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and especially the Bronx as burnt out shells.  Landlords burned their buildings rather than take a loss in income.  Also, it was considered a viable option to have your car towed to a desolate part of NYC and blown up.  Hey, it was either that and collect comp insurance or let the repo man get it.  Also the trains really were scary.  The train near me was the IRT (numbered trains from 1 to 5).  You did not ride these trains unless it was during rush hour or you were with a large group of friends.  The trains were covered in grafiti, filthy and the lights did not work.  You could ride to and from NYC and be sitting in the dark 75% of the time. Also the stations were the habitat of the homeless and gang kids.  42nd Street was also a notorious red-light district but that never seemed to be an issue with us New Yorkers.  We laughed about it. <br /> <br />Anyway, this film is a landmark film on street kids, gang culture and 70's NY.  It's campy, true, but back then almost every New Yorker dressed like a refugee of Studio 54 and the Mudd Club.  The gangs represent a drugged out, punk rock version of lower class hell (By the way, Punk Rock was a New York invention, London stole it from us).  The Baseball Furies, in particular, scared the living daylights out of me.  You can imagine the mess I was in when Halloween came around and everyone was a Baseball Fury.  I loved the fact that the gangs were a mix mashup of all kinds of kids.  All of whom had one allegiance, to perpetuating neighborhood turf wars, everything else (gender and race) came afterwards. <br /> <br />This film launched the careers of James Remarr, Michael Beck, Mercedes Ruehl, David Patrick Kelly and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.  Valkenburgh's performance in particular is affecting.  She was one of the glamorous tv stars and in this film she was covered in dirt.  One of the best scenes is when she comes face to face with rich prom kids on the train.  She tries to tidy herself up but Beck's Swan stops her.  It captures NY class warfare at it's most brutal. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is, of course, fantastic. <br /> <br />I shudder over the remake news.  This film is, was and always will be about New York.  Now they will take it and turn it into some moralistic, stylistic, car ad to sell us junk.  How depressing. <br />
B00005T30L|3.0|There's a lot to like about this movie.  It's funny, well-acted, and has some terrific music.  Thora Birch gives a great performance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Ghost World\\" wants to be \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and it can never be.  The problem is not that Enid isn't Holden Caulfield (she very nearly is) but that Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff aren't J. D. Salinger.  In short, the story accepts too much of Enid's point of view -- all of the people she mocks really are as shallow as they seem to her, including the most well-developed characters (like Seymour).  Clowes and Zwigoff populate her town with a melange of standard laugh-at-able stereotypes and freaks, but can't conjure up anyone to offer Enid perspective or guidance.<br /><br />Even the lonely old man on the bus stop bench misguides her.  His role is that of the mythological 'unrecognized seer/sage' who appears on the fringe to offer a way out of the world's madness through his own apparent insanity.  But by following him, she gets out of the madness only by getting out altogether -- she escapes instead of growing up.  Far from being 'ambiguous', the ending is only dispiriting.<br /><br />The film revels in its own arcane hipness, fascinated with rare delta blues records, Bollywood musicals and whatnot.  And the plot is full of gimmicks.
0596007124|5.0|Usually when reading through a book or article on design patterns I'd have to occasionally stick myself in the eye with something just to make sure I was paying attention.  Not with this book.  Odd as it may sound, this book makes learning about design patterns fun.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the pages are not paragraph after paragraph of information.  There isn't a single page that doesn't contain a doodle, a sidebar, a picture, or something different.  While at times it can be a little distracting, it's in a good way (at least I don't have to poke myself with something sharp anymore).<br /><br />The chapters cover various design patterns and along the way have exercises such as crossword puzzles or match games to test your understanding.  The answers are also included at the end of the chapters - so you don't need to purchase a \\"Teacher's Edition\\" on the black market.  =)<br /><br />Other books on design patterns are saying, \\"Buehler...  Buehler...  Buehler...\\" while this book is on the float belting out \\"Shake it up, baby!\\"
B000001F5F|4.0|The 1983 U2 release \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" captures the energy of their early live performances. What makes this especially dramatic is being able to capture a song lyric from \\"New Year's Day\\" that matches the visuals from the Red Rocks venue. Of course, here we just get the audio, but back in the day cuts from this concert were MTV staples, especially \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" with Bono's \\"this is not a rebel song...\\" and flag waving.<br /><br />This EP contains the essential songs from the first three releases, \\"Gloria,\\" \\"I Will Follow,\\" \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" and \\"New Year's Day.\\" All are performed with energy and verve, and minus all the effects of later releases. This is U2 stripped down to its bare essentials: Bono on vocals, The Edge on guitar, occasional piano (New Year's Day), Adam Clayton on bass, and Larry Mullen, Jr. on drums.<br /><br />The second cut, \\"11 o'clock tick tock\\" has a cool guitar riff.<br /><br />\\"Party Girl\\" appears as a live version that doesn't make it on a studio release until the B-sides portion of the 1980-1999 Best of compilation. There's a part where The Edge actually attempts a traditional solo, with mistakes and all.<br /><br />\\"The Electric Co.\\" is another high energy piece, and the sing-along anthem \\"40\\" closes out the set. If your U2 collection starts at Unforgettable Fire, you're missing out. This is a worthy addition.
B00004TL21|5.0|I don't really have anything to say about this album besides the fact that it got me into singing, and I'm very glad I found it.  This album vocally is truly outstanding.. listen to digital bath to find out what I mean.. and Passenger features the great Maynard James Keenan from Tool.. while for your screaming fix we've got Elite and Korea.  Truly a great album, amazing for vocal practice.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I can't believe they did not include Rick Springfield on the set , I will never buy it . It's so not complete . Why bother?Bob G. quick cash in cause of the bootlegs . Sorry excuse !!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this cd. I have been listening to this for about two weeks and I am still not tired of it. I love this and I will be listening to it in my car, on the way to school, on the way back, basically everywhere i go. Simple Plan ROCK ON FOREVER!
0553456210|5.0|I am a huge Bryson fan, I love his humor and his talent for noticing absurdity in everyday situations.<br /><br />This audiobook is on 5 CDs and plays for 6 hours, and features Bryson's sardonic voice telling us about his adventures over Europe. If you have liked his other books, you will like this one. He writes in a detailed enough way that you will want to slow down to savor this book, so hearing it read aloud is perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this audiobook is abridged, and while that is not always a problem for me, since I get bored easily and prefer the story to move along, with Bryson, I always feel like I am missing a little extra something with his audiobooks. His books are good enough to want to savor every word.<br /><br />So, do buy this audio CD version, but perhaps read the book first so you get the entire scoop and all the description, and listen to the audiobook in the car or while doing something else. It is one you will likely want to keep and listen to every time you get antsy for travel.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I went and bought this CD the first day it came out and I loved it from the beginning. Seriously, the whole CD is good. \\"Welcome to My Life\\" is one of my favorites. I wish it wasn't so mainstream so it could be that much more personal. My other favorite is \\"Everytime,\\" which is number eight. The lyrics are so awesome.<br /><br /> I was so stoked about the DVD part, and it's worth it. You can play each song on your DVD player with the CD cover in the background, it has the lyrics to every song and a little documentary on the making of SNGA.<br /><br /> I only had one problem: Not enough Patrick!
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Lacking the style and heart that made the original such a firm favorite among film fans and also without the talents of Noel Coward - who gave such a nicely humorous touch to the classic - was this weak 2003 remake.<br /><br />In truth this movie is more of a sequel than a remake. As most film fans will know the original movie concluded with the gang of bullion thieves stuck in a rather precarious situation atop one of the Italian Alps. The remake however includes the actual \\"Italian Job\\" of the title at the beginning of its movie and then weaves a tale of betrayal and payback that has one of the thieves double-crossing his partners and taking off with the gold himself.<br /><br />In this respect the movie probably would have been better off not adopting the name of its illustrious predecessor. In fact, in talks with the director to promote this movie, it was revealed that Italian authorities were less than happy to hear that Hollywood planned to remake a movie - that is such a \\"national treasure\\" in the hearts of Italy - that they almost refused the team to film in Venice. Only when they were able to convince the Italians that it was a homage and that they intended no disrespect to the original that they were allowed to continue.<br /><br />Fans of another remake (Ocean's Eleven) will no doubt lap this movie up. This production has another hip cast and the same slick method of storytelling. It was pleasing to see the return of the Morris Minor car as one of the holdovers from the original movie and I thought Charlize Theron was a welcome addition to the cast as the beautiful daughter of one of the original thieves. What was most disturbing though was the fact that the original Italian Job was an eclectic collection of British thieves, whereas here they are American - not sure why they made that change since the humor employed in the original was so British.<br /><br />Still, as heist movies go this film is a success and a lot of fun. If you enjoyed Clooneys version of OCEAN'S ELEVEN, then chances are you will enjoy this too.then chances are you will enjoy this too.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love the new album. The songs are hot and fresh and the only thing that slightly dissapointed me about it was that it was too short!
076790592X|4.0|The book was so awsome that i couldnt put the book down after the first page.It was interested in how Mitch and Morrie got along so well. Mitch the former studuent of morrie would go to vist Morrie on tuesdays because they were tuesday people. I think it's pretty cool how they would talk for hours about real life solutions. I found Morrie interested in he wasnt affraid to die and had no regrets. Mitch on the other hand didnt understand life as much as Morrie did. It was upsetting when Morrie found out he had Als also know as Lou Gehirg disease. The best part of the book was it didnt matter how far his disease progreesed becuase they still meet on every tuesday to talk about things in life. I would suggest this book to people who love to read books about people. I could not beleive how Mitch didnt cry till the end of the book. I guess it up to the you to read the book to found out what happens to  <br />Morrie.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I advise you all to get the album if you haven't already.  It's the best album ever.  I CRIED!!! :p It's even better than the first one.  What do you expect huh? The guys spent more time on this album.  Hard work does pay off. These guys are the best and they rock my world.  GO GET THE #1 album of the year!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm not a big fan of Green Day. Sure, they've had a few songs that I really like.  The only other CD I own by them is Dookie, which I really like. <br />I have to say that when I first heard the title track on the radio it grabbed my attention.  After reading a few reviews on here I went out and bought this disc.  I do not regret it for a minute.  This CD is EXCELLENT.  The songs, production, lyrics, music, guitar riffs, etc are top notch.  This is probably the best CD I've purchased this year. <br />If you are even considering getting this; go out and get it now. <br />If you're not considering it, you should.  You'll be missing out on a great CD.
0060005688|5.0|Author Schwartz, a distinguished psychological researcher, begins with an apparent contradiction: As contemporary Americans, we have more choices than ever before. However, increasing choices doesn't bring pleasure. In fact, we're more depressed than ever before!<br /><br />Schwartz devotes the entire book to explaining this paradox. What makes the book worth reading is, first, Schwartz's impeccable references to mainstream psychological research.  In particular, Chapter 3 \\"Deciding and Choosing\\" summarizes a greal deal of decision theory in straightforward, readable language.  Anyone embarking on the study of psychology or consumer behavior would do well to read this chapter with care.<br /><br />And second, Schwartz explains phenomena that we experience every day: buying airplane tickets, visiting grocery stores, and more.<br /><br />As a former marketing professor and current career consultant, I beleve Schwartz's theory has more relevance for consumer decisions than for life decisions, such as career choices. True, novelty effects wear off (adaptation) and constraints can actually induce satisfaction.  But not everyone faces a dazzling array of career choices, potential mates or even health insurance options.<br /><br />Even so, nine of Schwartz's ten tips for dealing with choice make sense for just about any situation.  \\"Make choices irreversible\\" does not make sense for careers.  Any job or career can end unexpectedly, and I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for new options.  And there's a fine line between learning to love constraints, which Schwartz enocurages, and giving up autonomy.<br /><br />Chapter 2,\\"New Choices,\\" is the most frustrating.  Some topics covered in a few paragraphs actually deserve a whole book, or at least a whole chapter.  In fact entire books have been written about choosing medical care -- not choosing doctors, Schwartz carefully points out, but choosing what the doctor will do.  This area is quite troubling; while ordinary patients feel baffled when called upon to choose a treatment, many choices are restrained by technicalities or insurance.  In Women's Bodies, Women's Minds, Christiane Northrup writes that insurance will cover pills, for instance, but not massage.<br /><br />The sections on choosing religion, love and identity are equally frustrating -- like getting one bite of chocolate cake without a complete piece. The endowment effect (discussed briefly in the context of money-back guarantees) would seem to act as a natural brake on choices and the decision to choose.  And many people don't feel they have as much choice over how they work as Schwartz would suggest.<br /><br />This is a book to own and re-read, and implications extend to other arenas. For instance, Schwartz cites evidence to show that explaining a decision changes both the content of the decision and subsequent satisfaction with the decision. How does this finding relate to, say, jury decisions involving life and death?<br /><br />Finally, Paradox of Choice was published in 2004 -- well after 9/11. Most people I know feel their choices have been constrained a great deal in the last few years. Travel has become more of a hassle and jobs are scarcer.  So are we happier?  Readers can decide for themselves.<br /><br /> .while ordinary patients feel baffled when called upon to choose a treatment, many choices are restrained by technicalities or insurance.

B000002542|5.0|This album was NOT recorded by the Journey incarnation that became multi-millionaires, by leaving a legacy of saccharine pop music hits. This album, \\"JOURNEY\\" and the next two, are so different than that later incarnation of the band as to be unrecognizable, even without Steve Perry. The music on this album speaks for itself, i.e., this was one party-hard, kicka** rock band. Greg Rolie and Neal Schon had just departed Santana, looking to leave their own mark.    How they succeeded!    This is the ORIGINAL Journey, so if you're looking for silly love songs go someplace else. This record is about ROCK MUSIC and MUSICIANSHIP. Listen to \\"Kohoutek\\" and \\"In The Morning Day\\" and you'll know what I mean. This record is eminently listenable. You'll find yourself, strangely, playing it over and over and over again. Maybe more than the records from the Perry era. This is one KICKA** listen.    However, Original Journey's LIVE music trumped every album they ever made, even this and their masterful second albums. This was just a KILLER live band. The devastating onstage musicianship of Rolie, Schon, bassist Ross Valory, rhythm guitar/bass player George Tickner, and the most under-appreciaeted rock drummer ever - Ainsley Dunbar - imparted to their music an electricity and excitement just not catchable on a studio recording. Other bands like Zepp, often suffered from crappy live performances. Not Original Journey.     Unlike the Sweet Steve Perry Journey, Original Journey had an intensity spawned of their love of playing hard rock music - not of desire for fame, money, and groupies...although I am sure they wanted - and got - all those things from the start. Simply said, I have yet to see any LIVE band better than the guys that made this album. You had to be there to see and hear just how INTENSE Original Journey was.      Being now in my early 50's, every time I listen to \\"Journey\\" I am taken back to the concerts I saw at the Cow Palace, Winterland, and the Oakland Coliseum, in which Original JOURNEY shredded the stage and stole the show away from the headliners (Dave Mason, for one).      The BEST way for novices to get an idea of how INTENSE this band was, is to follow the advice the band gives in the liner, here paraphrased: CRANK IT! Way to the right! You will not be disappointed.
B00008YJH5|5.0|There are some albums that just seem to be perfect. The Beatles' White Album, Led Zeppelin III, Jeff Buckley's 'Grace'. And, while of course 'perfect' means different things to different people, Surfer Rosa is one of those albums for me. Aside from possibly Sonic Youth, the Pixies are the most important, and innovative, rock band of the last 20 years. Surfer Rosa is their peak. <br /> <br />The album is an edgy, loud and almost uncomfortable listen all the way through, but it will make you smile, nod your head and just listen. Your attention will be instantly seized with its opening track, \\"Bone Machine\\" and kept the whole way through. The Pixies are one of the few bands whose sound hits you hard instantly yet manages to maintain that initial sensation listen after listen. \\"Bone Machine\\" is an exciting, original track that really encompasses what the band are all about. Heavy bassline, nonsensical lyrics, obvious dynamics (quiet verse, loud chorus) and great melodies. \\"Break my Body\\" follows on with this theme with what is one of my favourite chorus melodies of all time. <br /> <br />I could be here all day describing each song, and each song does merit a mention, but that might ruin it for you. The best thing about the Pixies is hearing them for the first time. That said, I must mention the song, \\"Broken Face\\", a personal favourite of mine. The band has a knack for upbeat, fun songs, and this is the best in its genre. However, while the album is still one of the best of all time and fully deserving of 5 stars, I have to admit that it dips towards the end. After \\"Where is my Mind?\\" (track 7), the same level of substance just isn't there. Not to say that it isn't great music, but it doesn't quite match up. That said, it does seem to conclude the album well, and maybe it somehow gives the album what makes it so great. <br /> <br />Before I finish, I should mention that the Surfer Rosa I have is combined with the Pixies' first album, \\"Come on Pilgrim\\". If that versionis available to you, I would recommend it highly both because it is better value (and, believe me, you will want more Pixies after hearing Surfer Rosa anyway) and because Come on Pilgrim ends very strongly, which rounds off brilliantly the slight dip in quality towards the end of Surfer Rosa. <br /> <br />I will say no more, just that this is up there with the best albums ever made - it has the x-factor.
B000002KBU|5.0|Reading through these reviews, so many people seem to have their own Blue story, a memorable journey towards understanding and loving this album. For me it started when my sister gave it to me when I was about 12. At first I failed to really appreciate it and, like so many here, left it on my shelf until eventually after hearing a snippet of A Case of You on a film some years later, it resurfaced. The CD took up residence in my CD player and slowly my understanding and love of it grew. One by one the songs have become relevant and suddenly made sense for me. And for me that is its beauty - it is an album which grows with you, its intimacy making it not just a beautiful and haunting listen but something which everyone, if they give it a chance, can relate to.  <br /> <br />Intimacy is at the heart of this album. Some reviewers here have criticised its depressing nature, but that is Joni at her most honest and raw, sharing tales of love and loss - it takes guts to sing about giving your daughter up for adoption on a commercial album. <br /> <br />It is almost impossible to choose a favourite song from this album. A Case of You has a special place in my affections, but I also love the escapist fantasy of River, the yearning for home of California, the cynicism of The Last Time I Saw Richard, the infatuation of My Old Man, the desperation of Little Green, the emptiness of Blue, the restlessness of All I Want... I could go on! <br /> <br />For me, the lines which best encapsulate the beauty, intimacy and honesty of this album are in A Case of You - \\"remember that time you told me, you said love is touching souls - well surely you touched mine, 'cause part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time\\".

B00006J3T4|5.0|I bought this album to \\"catch up\\" with my Mark Knopfler albums after purchasing Shangri-La.  I spend most of my radio time flitting from one station to another.  Most songs I hear are written by musicians that are obscenely overpromoted, and who overzealously write arcane lyrics to hide their own lack of musical exceptionalism.  They miss the idea that their instrument can be be far more moving than any words they pen, for the simple reason that they aren't exceptional musicians, let alone artists.  Knopfler doesn't just deliver on this album.  He teaches.  His compositions on this album delve so deep into the musical world, that they almost shame the latest songwriters who are promised as the next so-and-so.  Instead of settling for brief, three-and-a-half minute vignettes of modern life, Knopfler evokes a catalog of lives in as many different states.  The world is varied, but the underlying forces remain constant:  love, loss, struggle, humor.  Most artists are complacent, if not lucky enough, to evoke their own lives.  Knopfler's sighing guitar, notes plucked one by one, align all the wandering paths in this world with a common microtonal vocabulary.  When I listen to this album, I hear the artist more than the musician -- as it should be -- perhaps more than anything Knopfler has done since \\"On Every Street\\" with Dire Straits.  For all the hoopla showered on Dylan, Bowie, and Springsteen for occassionally measuring up to the laurels they earned 30 years ago, Knopfler doesn't need to worry about meeting those benchmarks.  This album is better than anything he's ever done.  In short, Knopfler isn't meeting the standards he set with with Dire Straits.  He's redefining them.

B00005YUPO|5.0|I have several of these tapes and this is the best for children under 2.  Both my babies seemed fascinated by the images, the music and the children interacting.  When my daughter was a baby she loved the little girl at the end saying, \\"I'm not the star anymore?\\"  This is definately my favorite, it has a soothing effect and helped my babies through cutting teeth, injuries, sickness and just basic baby crankiness.  Baby Bach, baby Doolittle and Baby Galileo are my three top picks.  Bach's music is lovely and while I am a big fan of Mozart, Bach has a tranquility and peace Mozart lacks.
038551123X|2.0|The premise of DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER is original: a serial killer researches, stalks, murders and dismembers only other serial killers; however, it quickly loses steam.<br /><br />A traumatic experience as a three-year-old warps Dexter for life. Luckily, his foster father, a police detective, discovers what kind of person he is and makes him promise that he will vent his spleen only on people who deserve it.<br /><br />Dexter's  foster sister, Deb, also a police woman, wants off of the vice beat (She lures various perverts by dressing as a prostitute). She expects Dexter, who works, appropriately, as a blood spatter expert, to help her get promoted to detective, and she sees an ideal opportunity when another murderer begins to imitate Dexter's Modus Operandi. But she's got competition in the ambitious Detective Migdia LaGuerta, who despises Deborah on sight.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that the author uses first person point of view. Dexter tells us what he is thinking at every opportunity, relishing each new murder as much as the culprit. This slows the pace to a crawl. I kept falling asleep; also the main characters are pretty much cliches. Deborah doesn't do anything except complain, and I've seen versions of Migdia LaGuerta in practically every cop show on TV. The dialogue and attempts at dark humor also fall flat.<br /><br />Author Lindsay creates some suspense when Dexter begins to suspect that he may be killing in his sleep, but the climax ends with a cliffhanger, and there is no transition between the climax and the resolution, leaving the reader dangling. It's hard to believe DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER had an editor.
6305736650|5.0|This cinematic masterpiece won 3 Academy Awards in 1943: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The acting as is timeless as the movie itself. Screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make the perfect pair as star-crossed lovers Rick and Ilsa who meet again in war-torn unoccupied France. Paul Henreid is memorable as resistance fighter/leader Victor Laszlo. Claude Rains (\\"The Adventures Of Robin Hood\\", etc.) is a cross between neutral and non-neutral as Louis Renault, prefect of police. Peter Lorre is subtly devious as the scheming Ugarte. Sydney Greenstreet (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\", etc.) is an accessory as Rick's business rival Ferrari. Conrad Veidt oozes pure venom as the evil Major Strasser. The movie works very well, not only in terms of story, but the techniques that were used: flashbacks where almost all of it was music, close-ups of the characters in the right places, etc. Max Steiner (Oscar winner for \\"Gone With The Wind\\" four years earlier) composed the score for this bittersweet tale of love, intrigue and patriotism. The movie's only real special features are the original theatrical trailer, trailers for other classic movies starring Humphrey Bogart and a revealing documentary, \\"You Must Remember This\\" (the first line of \\"As Time Goes By\\", featured in the film), which offers an exclusive look at the making of this landmark movie, hosted by none other than Bogie's wife (from 1945, a year after they starred in \\"To Have And Have Not\\" until his untimely death in 1957) and legendary actress, Lauren Bacall. This movie also should've won Bogie the Oscar for Best Actor, Ms. Bergman Best Actress, Mr. Steiner Best Score and Best Song (\\"As Time Goes By\\"). One of the movie's final lines, \\"Round Up The Usual Suspects\\", was the inspiration for the mind-bending, Oscar-winning film \\"The Usual Suspects.\\" (Look for my review of that twist-filled thriller later on). This film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a classic. Features the famous line \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" and the timeless song \\"As Time Goes By.\\" Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some violence.looking at you, kid\\" and the timeless song \\"As Time Goes By.\\" Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some violence.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|<br /> <br />The Arcade Fire's debut album entitled Funeral is anything but a sad affair, rather the music is a pure celebration of life. Hailing from Montreal, this indie-rock sextet's compositions are exploding with energy similar to the Talking Heads, the Flaming Lips, and Broken Social Scene. The Arcade Fire will breathe life into those who are waiting for \\"the next big thing\\" to arrive, because in terms of indie-rock, they may certainly be it.  <br />Over the past year, members of the Arcade Fire suffered many losses of their loved ones. Lead singer Win Butler lost his grandmother in March, and instrumentalist Richard Parry lost his aunt. Reeling from their losses, the band collaborated to give birth to their debut, Funeral. But they have overcome in true fashion, and in the process, earned praise from Pitchfork Media and College Music Journal as one of the best bands this year. The Arcade Fire earned top honors at this year's CMJ Music Marathon in New York City.  <br />The Arcade Fire break their tracks into different \\"neighborhoods\\", each with its own distinct sound. The stage is set in \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" with a climbing piano melody, driving disco/dance-hall drum rhythm, and an echoing guitar. As the track progresses, the speed does as well, and it is finally concluded with an eerie-yet-charming vocal chorale.  <br />The sextet combines a variety of sounds for \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\". A tribal drumming cadence soon transforms into a French sounding accordion, and is finally bound together by an oriental string backup. Its something that simply must be heard to be understood fully. <br /> \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" charges forth with a constant pulse felt in the drum kit, with underlying support found in the orchestra sound provided by strings and xylophone bells.  <br />\\"Neighborhood #4 (Kettles)\\" carries a folk music quality, surrounded by a dark tone from the orchestra. Acoustic guitar, accompanies the simple ballad sung by Butler \\"they saya watched pot won't ever boil/well I closed my eyes, and nothin' changed/ Just some water getting hotter in the flames.\\"   <br />The Arcade Fire masterfully crafts each song, with nearly all of the tracks building into something incredible, with finales that will keep you replaying the song over and over again. \\"Une Anne Sans Lumiere\\" is one of the most amazing songs on the album. The French mixed with English lyrics are laid back as Butler duets with his wife and co-songwriter Régine Chassagne, and the finale explodes with guitar driven energy.  <br />\\"Crown of Love\\" is dark ballad about love, held firmly together by a power driven string section. Butler constructs a complex piece here, again with well written lyrics. The surprise ending here is a techno driven accompaniment to the string section, which is sure to get your foot tapping.  <br />\\"Haiti\\" and \\"In the Backseat\\" change the vocal lead from Butler to Chassagne, which proves to be interesting. \\"Haiti\\" was written about Chassagne's parents past, as they fled a dictatorship in the 1960s to New York, and it serves a near memoir like purpose on the album, reflecting on the terrible past while looking for hope in the future. \\"In the Backseat\\" features a childlike innocence, as Chassagne ponders the outside world from the backseat of a car. The instrumentation becomes heavy as the song progresses, relying on heavy drums and powerful guitar chords.  <br />Overall, the Arcade Fire manage to collect a life's worth of images and emotions and fit them into a ten track album. From Bitterness and hope to love and solitude, this dark toned album is uplifting as it progresses through its countless stages. This indie-rock epic that the Arcade Fire has constructed is only a sign of what good is to come. <br />~Matt O'Rourke (info for this article was taken from [...])  <br />

B0006284JQ|5.0|I do agree that this CD of Britney is \\"the greatest hits\\" even though I didn't buy this CD, but of course, I got all of her CD's and I have listened to her new single, \\"My Prerogative\\" and thought that her version is better than the original version fromt he 80's or something. The rest of the songs that's not in her previous CD, I have kinda listen to it, and thought that it is pretty good. All the songs in this CD is the songs that I listen to when I am listening to her CD, so this greatest hits ablum is a great deal considering it has the good songs in it that worths listening to and the price is like so much cheaper than buying the rest of her CD's. I know people give bad opinions to her after her little \\"cheating\\" thing, but think again, her music has nothing to do with her real life, and she is kind of a good singer, so why not buy it and listen to it and maybe you will like it for the one's who have never listen to her before.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Richard Curtis has proven, in the past, that he has an eye and ear for the tender moments that make up the better part of humanity. In his directorial debut, he has delivered a movie shows the very best in people. In it's weakest moments, Love Actually was entertaining. In it's best, it was moving and capable of touching your soul. I really didn't see a weak performance in the bunch. I did feel the use of music was a bit overdone, particularly towards the end. Curtis delivers such fine dialogue, he should have let it carry the finale rather than pop music. All in all, Love Actually is a fantastic movie that shines because of the wonderful performances by an incredible cast that was given a great script.

B000002KGT|5.0|This is the best rock album of all time, hands down.  With soft ballads such as 'Sara', driving rock such as 'Go Your Own Way', and just downright great songs like 'You Make Lovin' Fun', no other recording consistently hits all the right spots.  'You Make Lovin' Fun' is, in my 35 years of listening to rock music, the perfect rock song.  (Not that trash Nirvana song that was recently voted as the best by a bunch of nitwit djs).  The lyrics are great and the music blends perfectly.  There is not a single bad song on the album.  It will be around a long time, and is truly a \\"classic\\" recording.
B0000085N4|5.0|OK.. Firstly. I am not.. I repeat, NOT a deranged fanboy. <br />My tastes range from jazz (Coltrane, Brubeck, Alpert) to Metal (Pantera, Metallica, Nuclear Rabbit.... never heard of the last one? look em up.) and all the Classical, Pop, Rock etc you can fit in between.  <br />Sonic Temple by The Cult is the one album that I never get tired of.  As far as I am concerned there is no 'weak' track on this album. <br /> <br />From start to finish this album provides a veritable rollercoaster for the aural senses.  Kick starting the ride with the opening chords of Sun King it's time to rock! I'm fighting the urge to describe every track in detail here.  Let's just say that from the next track (the seminal Fire Woman) through the haunting Edie (Ciao Baby), and Wake Up Time For Freedom (This one sends a shiver up my spine every time) to the finale of Medicine Train we bear witness to a captured moment in time that defines an era.  <br />A Time when all that mattered was the music and the feeling. <br /> <br /> <br />This is truly both Ian Astbury and Bob Rock's finest hour. <br /> <br /> <br />If you don't own it, buy it.  <br />If you can't justify buying it, steal it...

B0002KVUKM|5.0|Van Helsing was a very enjoyable movie which deserves a little more praise than it got.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were wonderful throughout and the ending was surprisingly sad. And the friar sidekick was also well played by Welham.<br /><br />The computer animation in this movie was done remarkably well and the many transformations in the movie are done with silky smoothness. And the many beautiful scenes and backgrounds of landscapes captures you into thinking you are really in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />Most of the accents in this movie are a bit annoying and over the top however. And Dracula looked a bit too 'pretty.' Other than that i cant think of anything bad about the movie.<br /><br />Oh, and the Bloopers feature on the dvd is hilarious.<br /><br />I just wish more movies would include their 'bloopers' on their dvds too...
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Yes, it would have been better if everything had been included in this dvd. Anyway, I am glad this dvd set is released and will buy them because the dvds will still have a lot of good stuff I couldn't get from any other dvds and also the price is right (actually cheap for a 4 dvd set). I just hope the audio/video quality will be great. Especially, I want them to have PCM stereo audio track, which I always prefer due to its uncompressed and natural sound.

In the process of these events, the bus jumps a gap, Keanu's partner gets a surprise and a little bit of romance between Keanu and Sandra Bullock (Murder 8y Numbers, 28 Days) happens...2 kisses really..nothing touchy-feely. Nicely played out and executed with memorable action scenes. Keanu Reeves is one of his best roles, alongside Neo in The Matrix movies, of course...Sandra Bullock = sexy, sexy and Dennis Hopper = evil a-hole but he is perfrect in the role. Also starring Alan Ruck (Tv's Spin City, Ferris Buellers Day Off), Richard Lineback (Hush, Varsity Blues), Joe Morton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Executive Decision), Beth Grant (Tv's Angel (season one guest star)) and Glenn Plummer (The Salton Sea, The Substitute). If you want some advice about the sequel Speed 2; Cruise Control...here it is...dont watch it....just be glad this was the better one of the two.
B000001E8S|4.0|U2 and Brian Eno have enjoyed one of popular music's most artistically and commercially successful partnerships for two decades running, but prior to - and after - this unusual 1995 outing, their association has basically been one of band and producer. On ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1, however, a de facto new entity, Passengers, was formed by all five men and a slew of guest artists to craft a singular piece of work in the discographies of all involved. <br />   While the concept of ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 - an album of film music drawn from films which never existed - may seem a bit silly, it makes sense in the context of its era, a time when \\"hip\\" music - including that of U2 and Brian Eno - was first making serious inroads into the world of movies. Not surprisingly, the aural evidence suggests that the dominant vision here is Eno's; but U2's presence gives the ambient auteur's ideas a welcome dose of drive and accessibility, just as Eno's tweaking has done wonders for U2's sense of sonic detail over the years. <br />   With fourteen tracks representing fourteen fictitious films, ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 is inevitably a mixed bag, but the highlights are many. \\"United Colors,\\" one of numerous instrumentals herein, lets the listener know from the outset that this isn't a U2 album in any proper sense, though the beautiful, minimalist \\"Slug\\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on ZOOROPA. Other noteworthy tracks include the Leonard Cohenish \\"Your Blue Room,\\" the dizzying musical chant \\"Always Forever Now\\" and the lovely instrumental \\"Beach Sequence.\\" A show-stopping guest spot from Luciano Pavarotti distinguishes \\"Miss Sarajevo,\\" while \\"Elvis Ate America\\" leavens the proceedings with some (arguably excessive) humor. Anyone listening will undoubtedly prefer some tracks to others, but this is a decidedly easy fifty-eight minutes to sit through overall. <br />   Coming in between U2's two most experimental albums - ZOOROPA and POP - ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 offers a welcome breakin the band's otherwise breathless explorations of electronica and studio density in the nineties, while reaffirming its place (and Eno's) at the creative forefront of popular music. The fact that this isn't a U2 album in no way stops it from being a worthy addition to the band's catalogue, as well as an effective challenge to the \\"I hate U2\\" and \\"I hate post-JOSHUA TREE U2\\" contingents. Good stuff!  <br />
B0000AXE8I|4.0|There's trouble in wonderland as Neo, Keanu Reeves (Point Break, Speed) along with Trinity, Carrie Ann Moss (Chocolat, Red Planet) and Morpheus must prepare themselves for whats to come. Theres a war brewing and also theres something fishy going on inside the matrix. Neo, being the chosen one must come face to face with multiple situations and deal with the outcome of each. Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving (The Adventures Of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, Lord of the rings trilogy) is multipying inside the matrix..growing stronger and stronger and soon he will break out. Morpheus is convinced that better things will come and the machines will stop doing what they are doing and leave the humans along. There's action galore and more expanded story. The Wachaski Brothers have done it again making the questions and untold answers from the first one spew out into this one and sort of end it in the 3rd one. There's a long but highlighted chase scene on a highway...the digital burly brawl with Neo and The Agent Smith's, though come on people who are we kidding...there is no way in hell they could of choreographed that whole fight scene with just Keanu and a bunch of extras...theres no way. The ghost twins are excellent villains although they dont have that much time on film they make it entertaining while it lasts. Laurence Fishburne (Mystic River, Deep Cover) is just too cool for school...he's the bomb. We all know Reeves can act like wood sometimes in his movie but from my understanding Andy and Larry wrote the character of Neo that way...so it's really hard to know that Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and even Will Smith tried out for that role.. Keanu is a perfect cast. Also starring Harrold Perrineau, Jr. (Tv's LOST, HBO's OZ), Monica Bellucci (Brotherhood OF The Wolf, Under Suspicion), Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (Collateral Damage, The Human Stain), Jada Pinkett Smith (Return To Pardise, Demon Knight)and Gloria Foster. Foster died before doing Revolutions, so they replaced her with actress Mary Alice
B00000IP4H|4.0|Demonic is Testament their seventh album. In 1997 I bought this album for my brother, who until then was a huge fan of the band. I have always appreciated the band, but was never a huge fan. My brother did not like the album, so he gave it to me. After listening to the album a few times, I really started to like the album. I personally think it is their best album, although I understand that not many people share this view.     Only vocalist Chuck Billy and guitarist Eric Peterson are left of the line-up from their debut-album The Legacy. On Demonic Gene Hoglan plays drums and Derrick Ramirez, a former Testament member from the early days, plays bass. Demonic sounds rather different than early records. Testament is known for its fast and technical Thrash Metal with superb solos. Demonic is a mainly mid-tempo album with fewer solos. Although the solos are not bad they cannot compete with solos from former Testament guitarists Alex Skolnick and James Murphy. The solos are slower and sound more dissonant.    Vocalist Chuck Billy used to sing with raw but melodic vocals. On Demonic he mainly uses Death Metal vocals. I personally think that he should have used his \\"normal\\" vocals more. \\"John Doe\\" is one of the few songs with \\"normal\\" vocals. The music is slower, more raw and less melodic than in the past, \\"Demonic Refusal\\", \\"Murky Waters\\" and \\"Ten Thousand Thrones\\" are the only fast song on the album. The atmosphere on the album is darker than on earlier records. Demonic is a great album but could have been better when the vocalist would switch more often between \\"normal\\" and Death Metal vocals, and the album would have had more fast songs.      My favourite songs are:   \\"John Doe\\": The \\"normal\\" vocals work so well on the song.    \\"Demonic Refusal\\": A fast brutal song. Check out the cool intro.    \\"Burning Times\\": I really like the chorus.
B00063MBU8|5.0|The sophomore album of the next teen sensation, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" by Simple Plan is a kick but album.  Whether you're rich and have everything, or you're poor and have absolutely nothing, this cd has a song for you.  My #1 fav. is \\"Crazy\\".  #6 on the cd.  It's about how crappy the world has gotten and some of th bad things in it.  It's definately worth listening to.  Some other songs include their single, \\"Welcome to my Life\\", \\"Shut Up!\\", and \\"Perfect World\\".  All, great songs that'll make your life seem not as bad.  If you're debating on whether you should buy the cd or not, you definately should.  It's 100% worth the 15 dollars it costs.  There's no way you'll regret buying this cd.
6305132984|5.0|Set amid stunningly realistic-looking fire escapes and apartment buildings, the 1961 movie version of WEST SIDE STORY includes nearly all of the great Leonard Bernstein/Stephen Sondheim score and excitingly recreates Jerome Robbins' original Broadway choreography.  Robbins' choreographic language -- which turns even violent \\"rumbles\\" into electrifying dance sequences -- is just as sensational onscreen as it reportedly was on Broadway in 1957.   The dancing, in fact, outshines the singing.  Although the \\"Jets\\" and \\"Sharks\\" are solid in their numbers and the singer who dubs Richard Beymer has a fine voice, those who sing for Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno pale beside Carol Lawrence and Chita Rivera on the original Broadway cast recording.  But the acting is strong all around.  Wood may look a bit mature for the teenage Maria, but she glows here - just as she would in her next musical role, Gypsy Rose Lee in GYPSY.  Beymer's Tony likewise lights up the screen, especially in his solo \\"Something's Coming.\\"  Moreno is a sincere actress and a lithe dancer.  Each \\"Jet\\" and \\"Shark\\" convinces as a teenage gang member; Russ Tamblyn is a natural as Riff.  The screenplay, adapted by Ernest Lehman from Arthur Laurents' libretto, is tightly dramatic, building swiftly to a tragic conclusion - brought about, as in ROMEO AND JULIET, by miscommunication and rash behavior - and also suggesting that the young \\"hoodlums\\" are more sinned against than sinning (they are trapped in a city seething with racial resentment; fear and hatred of immigrants began with adults like Lieutenant Shrank and was passed down to the young people).  After watching the heartbreaking final scenes of this WEST SIDE STORY, one feels emotionally numb; all the tragedy of ROMEO AND JULIET, and of the original stage musical, comes across in the movie, as does the dancing and (albeit more weakly) the score.
B0000AVF29|5.0|\\"For Those Of Another Generation......\\". Yep.....I guess we certainly were. Like many, I was turned onto this album back when I was a youngster in the late 60's and couldn't get enough of this album to the point of owning the mono & stereo vinyl versions as well as the 8 track and reel to reel audio tapes. My only complaint with any of the releases pertained to the overall \\"compressed\\" sound quality, especially on tracks such as \\"Paint It Black\\" & \\"Yes, I'm Experienced\\" (two of my favorites).  <br /> <br />In the late 80's, Polydor finally released this album on CD and to my horror, the sound quality didn't differ one bit from the vinyl. Then came BGO in 2002 with their CD version, coupled along with The Twain Shall Meet (another great album) and although the mix had been somewhat improved, much of the compressed atmosphere still lingered. I began to believe that no actual master tapes would surface to right the various wrongs, but I was \\"Gratefully Dead\\" wrong ( a bonus track :)  <br /> <br />As it turns out, Repertoire came to the rescue and did the impossible...gave a newly found face lift to the original grooves on this album and what we now have is the ultimate remastered version ever released during the past 37 years since it was first recorded. The original muffled high end frequencies now have a uniformity of clarity & brightness never heard before throughout the entire album. It's amazing to finally be able to hear what Barry Jenkins drumming really sounds like.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of this brilliant album, I strongly recommend you buy a copy and hear it for the VERY first time in your life and while you're at it, also pick up a copy of The Twain Shall Meet also released by the good folks at Repertoire. They deserve numerous kudos for their excellent work and I look forward to seeing what other albums they release in the future.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Yeah, yeah, so Faceless sounds like the other Smack albums, but guess what? All those albums are by the same band! They have their distinct sound, and they don't change it from album to album. And if they did, you probably would still put them down, right? Now, on to my review. <br /> <br />Granted, the intros sound similar, but the songs themselves are all different. Tony has definitely improved as a guitarist since the first album, and Sully's vocals are as great as ever, maybe even better than usual. Robbie's bass is, as always, amazing, and I think Shannon is a great addition to the band. I may even like him better than Tommy. Another thing I like about this album, is that the lyrics are more upbeat. As much I love jumping around screaming \\"GO AWAY!!!!\\" to the beat of \\"Whatever,\\" Faceless is a nice change from that. There's a lot of stuff about self-discovery, \\"I'm looking for changes,\\" \\"I just needed to realign,\\" \\"To learn how my life came together. Releasing the demons again,\\" are just a few examples of that. Yet, despite the upbeat lyrics, there's still some classic anger and hate: \\"I F****** Hate You,\\" \\"Straight Out of Line,\\" and \\"Faceless.\\"  <br /> <br />So there. This album IS in fact, not as much like the others as you may think. And no, that's not an opinion. It's a fact. All you have to do to figure that out is listen to the album, and you'll know I'm right. You don't have to like it, you just have to know that it's not like the other albums.
B0002XNSY0|1.0|I doubt that you could imagine how much it would pain me to give a single-star rating to an edition of the film I consider to be the singular greatest contribution to the motion picture.  However, the new \\"40th Anniversary\\" edition of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb is, unquestionably, requiring of such a rating.  Why?, you ask.<br /><br />Because about fifteen to twenty percent of the screen image has been removed!!!<br /><br />If you take a look, you will see that this new \\"Special\\" edition of Dr. Strangelove is presented in anamorphic widescreen, with a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  This, as you can find from examining older editions of the film, is the first time the film has ever been presented in such a manner.  The reason why (and you may cross-check this with the Internet Movie Database [IMDb] or any book on Stanley Kubrick worth its salt) is because Dr. Strangelove was NOT FILMED in 1.66:1.  It was technically filmed with a varying aspect ratio (the reasons for which are still not fully explicated, as far as I've seen), but, in general, it was filmed in about 1.33:1.<br /><br />So, you ask, how does a film shot in 1.33:1 get presented in 1.66:1?  Did someone return to the original negative and uncover material previously hidden from sight, lost on every print and VHS, Beta, laserdisc and DVD copy heretofore released?<br /><br />NO!<br /><br />They simply cut off the top and bottom of the screen!!!<br /><br />Such things are not unprecedented.  An extremely similar case is the so-called \\"panoramic\\" Gone With The Wind.  The film, made in 1939 (before there was anything BUT 1.33:1, the \\"Academy\\" aspect ratio), when released in the Panavision/Technorama age of the mid-1960's was similar chopped and changed to magically become 2.35:1.  This edition was released on video and DVD a few times before, finally, it was restored to its original 1.33:1 glory.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick was absolutely notorious for his perfectionism and auteur status in the film industry, and I cannot believe that a company proposing to release a definitive \\"Special\\" edition of his greatest masterpiece would be so heartless as to unnecessarily delete a good portion of the screen.<br /><br />Please avoid this new, bastardized Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.  While the few new extras thereon are of interest, they can easily be seen via rental from the local video store, as suplemental to the last \\"Special Edition\\" of the DVD (which, incidentally, clearly states on the back that it is \\"Presented in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1.33:1\\".<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Marc-David Jacobs<br /><br />P.S. For those of you interested in seeing the terrible editing job for yourselves, feel free to go out and rent the new edition and the previous edition and go to seven minutes and forty-eight seconds, which is the extreme tight shot of the B-52's CRM-114 decoder book.  As you will see, an entire line of text on the top, and about one-and-a-half on the bottom are not completely missing.s for his perfectionism and auteur status in the film industry, and I cannot believe that a company proposing to release a definitive \\"Special\\" edition of his greatest masterpiece would be so heartless as to unnecessarily delete a good portion of the screen. <br /> <br />Please avoid this new, bastardized Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This was the prize of my collection, the only time I let it out of my sight was the day it was wrenched out of my apartment at knifepoint by a derelict crack fiend.  So I had to buy a second one.  For a fan of the Alien mythology I need say no more, you already know, but for the DVD lover....this is the best packaging ever, For the price and its expansive fold out design it's truly a piece of work.  A Christmas present for any sci-fi fan.   <br />     That said, I must admit that I never got to watch the first two, I was simply enthralled by 3 and Resurrection.  Although it's not what Fincher would have made given the freedom, it's as close as we can come.  For anyone who hated three I beg them to give the extended edition a try.  Fincher took a whole lot of muck and did the best that Anyone could.  The story is more in depth, character development is in place....You actually care when Charles Dance gets it, and the visuals, while not quite up to par, it's a workprint, the visuals are fantastically elaborate and visionary.   <br />     Resurrection is in the same boat, the opening and closing of the film make it, with the very first scene you know what you are getting....instead of the surprise for fans when the scary credits led into a French artfilm.  Even if you don't like the developments in the flick you must admit it's quick fun and a great way to spend the evening.  Those were the two that need explaining.  As for the first two, I need say no more.  I own the first two as singles as well and have them both memorized, pretty much that favorite book you don't need to read again but it's great for reference.   <br /> <br />I ramble too much,,,just buy this thing.   <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|After hearing this album, I was just blown away!  This has to be one of the strongest greatest hits albums of recent years!  It's so heavily pumped in the music, beats and rhythms!  Even Toxic gives Baby One More Time some tight competition!  It's like a shift from her fun pop at first to her more sexier and mature numbers later.  One high-energy song after next the first 6 songs!  I thought that she would put Baby One More Time first, but she pushed that to track 8.  That My Prerogative gets more exciting after every listen.  And there's no denying the 7 Max Martin songs on here, proving his dominance of hits in the late '90s to 2001. And Neptunes and Bloodshy and Avant were good with updating her sound. SLave For U, Boys, Overprotected, You Drive Me Crazy, Sometimes (which I still love), Stronger and others I still love.  This is bound to be the Steve Miller Band greatest hits success for the 21st century, as people will keep buying and buying it after wearing the last copy.  Miller's album still sells strong and I'm sure it will be the same for Britney. Britney's singing got better between albums 2 and 4.  She's just comfortable with these pop dance numbers. Track 16 I like, but track 17 I don't of the new songs, but that's a minor flaw in an otherwise phenomenal album.  Will be potential Christmas gifts for anybody in December!!!!!!
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Although it is not the hits-intensive package that 1992's GREATEST HITS was, this two-disc retrospective does a solid job of covering ZZ Top's 20-year career on Warner Bros. from 1970's ZZ TOP'S FIRST ALBUM to 1990's RECYCLER.<br /><br />In addition to early hits like \\"La Grange\\" and \\"Tush,\\" there are, of course, the mid-eighties MTV hits like \\"Gimme All Your Lovin',\\" \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" and the original single version of \\"Legs.\\" [GREATEST HITS included a remix version.] The album closes with a rousing live version of \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" from 1980, but the dance mix of \\"Legs\\" and the 12\\" remix of \\"Velcro Fly\\" leave a bad taste in an otherwise stellar collection of big hits and strong album cuts.<br /><br />All in all, it's a matter of how big a fan you are.  If you want more than the 18-track GREATEST HITS but don't want to spring for the 4-disc box set CHROME, SMOKE & BBQ, then RANCHO TEXICANO is exactly what you're looking for.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This grand monster hunt comes to life as Van Helsing and pays tribute to all the truly great classic monsters while remaining visually interesting enough for all of today's special effects enthusiasts. <br /> <br />The movie begins in a creepy castle, filmed in black and white, and we meet Dr. Frankenstein, his Monster, Dracula and Igor as all the fun begins. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is busy in Paris battling a nasty but large Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame Cathedral. Meanwhile across Europe, and in a little country called Transylvania, a brave and daring heroine (Kate Beckinsale) has hopes of saving her brother from life as a Wolfman. All of the greats are represented here (minus the Mummy) and the story is both interesting and classically told.  <br /> <br />Stephen Sommers has made a visually beautiful and classic monster film paying fantastic tribute to all those who came before him. The special effects are quite good and you will find yourself transported into a really good video game that allows one to discover something different every time this film is seen. Jackman is the perfect hero as the title character being handsome, strong and silly all at the same time. Kate Beckinsale brings the typical frail heroine into a new light as the strong and feisty Princess Anna. The main nemesis is Dracula, played humorously by Richard Roxburgh. Dracula's brides are sexy, evil and quite vicious. Will Kemp plays the Wolfman and looks great out of costume! Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to life with the perfect blend of humor and snide remarks but sadly no flies and finally the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) finally has a voice and uses it well. Altogether the cast in this film is highly entertaining and the storyline quite interesting. Of course the special effects in this film often override true human talent but they are well worth your time.  <br /> <br />This film is fun, entirely entertaining and beautiful to watch unfold while at the same time being a wonderful tribute to all of the classic monsters. A great film for the family that doesn't take monsters (and fighting them) too literally. Sommers has mastered the ability to take traditional monster movies and spin them into a new form while paying proper tribute to the original. I suspect Van Helsing will emerge as the new hero of modern monster films and foresee a sequel ready to be bolted into life.  <br />
B0002KVUKW|3.0|An entertaining fast-paced good-looking but shallow horror/action movie with predictable flaws.  Translation:  100 m.p.h. eye candy.  Too many monsters (Dracula, Dracula's Brides, Dracula's offspring, Frankenstein, Werewolves, Mr. Hyde, good grief) stuffed into this movie diluted the impact of each.  Weak dialogue.  Weak interlacing of monster plots.  No character development.  But non-stop action, for those of you who likey!  I freely admit that, being a horror fan, I was highly entertained.  Not scared, but definitely entertained.  Hence the three star rating. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have complained about the amount of special effects and the computer-generated monsters, but I was entertained by all the effects, the Brides in particular, and felt the movie as a whole was visually very stylish and beautiful.  But logic says that fewer special effects and action sequences would have made room for some components that were sorely lacking (already mentioned above).   <br /> <br />The parallels between the Van Helsing character in this movie and the Wolverine character in X-Men, both played by Jackman, were a little odd.  Both movies:  Mysterious hero figure who can't remember his past fights evil under the direction of a clandestine group. And both have the wolf factor!  hmmmm.  But I can hardly complain about the derivative aspects when I can gaze at Jackman's lovely long locks.  If you ladies thought Jackman was a hottie in X-Men, wait til ya see Van Helsing.  Unfortunately, I felt the male and female leads in Van Helsing had no chemistry.  And, oh, for you guys:  whats-her-name is a hottie too. <br /> <br />The humour that made Stephen Sommer's other movie \\"The Mummy\\" delightful is completely absent here.  Too bad.  And the Dracula character wasn't quite creepy enough, wasn't quite other-worldly and detached enough for my taste.  Van Helsing's Dracula reminded me more of a James Bond villian, a megalomaniac with dreams of world domination through this offspring.  Sure, he can turn into into a bat-demon, but I got the distinct impression that he preferred his man-form.  One of the movie's characters is clearly stolen from the James Bond films, but frankly, little in this movie is original, so who cares?  As for the acting in general... well, it's an action movie, so let me congratulate the actors on the wire-work and stunts.  Very well done!
B0002YLC24|5.0|This film hit me right in the heart. <br /> <br />In 1995, I was struggling through a failing marriage and longing for a lost love, when Before Sunrise came out.  My \\"lost love\\" (\\"K.\\") and I had reconnected by then, and she pointed me to Sunrise as a remarkably close representation of our own relationship.  And she was right.  Granted, K. and I lasted longer as a couple than Jesse and Celine, but we traveled together in Paris, at about the same ages as the two onscreen lovers, and everywhere we looked, there was another reminder, another example, another \\"coincidence,\\" that made each of us, separately, feel that we were watching ourselves on the screen.  Their introspective, heartfelt, sometimes playful, sometimes poignant dialogue perfectly matched our own - a dialogue that fortunately continues to this day. <br /> <br />K. and I remain dear friends, although we now live over 2,000 miles apart, but this sequel has rekindled all of those feelings and remains an eerie, uncanny parallel to our own lives.  I since have (re-) married and have a wonderful child and a successful career, while K. has a great career and life of her own, not unlike the situation with Jesse and Celine.  Yet, the connection between us remains as vibrant and tangible as ever, just as it does for the Before Sunset characters. <br /> <br />The chemistry between Jesse and Celine in Before Sunset remains palpable and intense, as it does for K. and me.  As other reviewers have said, if you are looking for the action-star Ethan Hawke, or you want more than scintillating, REAL acting (to coin an oxymoron) or riveting dialogue, you should look elsewhere for your entertainment.  This is no mindless film experience.  However, if you want a look at what true love, unrequited or otherwise, feels like, watch both of these movies. <br /> <br />I know it may seem trite and maybe a tad pretentious, but nothing has more accurately portrayed the seminal relationship of my life more than Before Sunrise and BeforeSunset.  I heartily recommend them both.
B00004XPPE|5.0|This is an outstanding movie, with probably the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.  It's a chilling story from the Cold War (no pun intended).  A group of bombers is sent toward Russia in response to an unidentified object showing up on the radar.  By the time they figure out that the object was harmless, it's too late to recall the bombers. <br /> <br />The President is working with his military advisors and the Russians to try to stop a nuclear war, and the solution they come up with in the end is pretty amazing. <br /> <br />Henry Fonda plays the president and does a great job, as always. <br /> <br />One other thing about the movie that's actually kind of funny is how primitive the computer equipment looked, and how they talk about it being the most advanced technology available.
B0001I561E|5.0|was what we were brought into by the magical 4 four movies that well all know so well--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. What sets Aladdin apart from the other 3 is its all-out comedy paired with exquisite romance, action and mystique. We were all awed by The Cave of Wonders...the genie's far-out and hilarious antics, and a story of a boy in a Cinderfella type of tale; rags to riches. Jasmine fights for her RIGHT to choose to whom and when she will be married...and a genie longs for freedom A very touching movie that truly deserves its placement in the Platinum Edition series begun with Snow White--Aladdin should be on 2 discs filled with bonus features and completely restored. I'm expecting quite a treat when it is released...  <br />This movie will touch you, entertain you...and teach you. <br /> <br />
B000001FTD|5.0|Simply their best.  Offering 3 of their greatest songs ever, Indians, Caught In a Mosh, & I Am the Law, this 9 track CD was all over the place in 1987.  Headbanger's Ball on MTV played a few videos, the band put out an in-concert video and were just becoming HUGE.  One major problem was their choice in bright Jams shorts and tank tops with goofy sneakers that started wearing when touring this album.  Truly the most anti-metal clothes one could find.  This started their decent into mediocre music and albums.  \\"Among the Living\\" was the last time the band took themselves, their fans, and their music seriously.  What a shame because this is a great record.  These guys were as heavy as Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer but with actual sing along choruses thanks to the \\"gang\\" backing vocals perfected on \\"Spreading the Disease\\".  Dan Spitz plays some great leads and Joey Belladonna is all over this stuff as a vocalist.  The perfect voice for Anthrax.  Great Stuff.  If you even think you like metal, this is for you.  Sidenote:  The album was dedicated to Metallica's late bass player, Cliff Burton.

We read the book aloud and laughed at the parts that we recognized and sighed over the difficult moments that we also understood. Worth a read if you want a glimpse into a world that is intriguing, amusing, and telling all at once. <br />
B000001FFR|5.0|Fistful of Metal was a Kiss on speed sounding record, average vocalist, average songs, average band.  On this recording, Spreading the Disease, new singer Joey Belladonna steps in and not only do the songs improve, so does the production and the overall product, as well as the band. Joey's voice really helped push this band.  Modern day Anthrax is now sporting John Bush and the results are day and night, no longer classic Anthrax.  There isn't a dud on this CD, the boys come at you with their \\"gang\\" backing vocals that help make these Anthrax songs.  9 great tracks, although there are A.I.R, Madhouse, Armed & Dangerous, and Lone Justice that rise to the top.  This CD comes from a time when metal was new and we didn't have or worry about MTV.  Their best behind \\"Among the Living\\".
0553573403|5.0|My appreciation for this book has grown since reading it for the second time. I discovered the books online and heard nothing but good things about them, so in summer of 2002 I decided to try out the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. What I found was a gritty, dark, suspenseful, and utterly captivating masterpiece of which I had never seen the likes of before.<br /><br />Reader beware: this is not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for the Lord of the Rings type of fantasy (heroes go on magical quest to save the world, with good and evil clearly defined, brave characters like Samwise and Aragorn are ever pure, evil ALWAYS loses), then this is not for you. Instead you will be met with a rousing tale in which multiple storylines are juggled, every single character is flawed, good and evil are not always clearly defined (and sometimes we are left wondering if we should root for some characters!), innocence is lost, evil runs rampant, and the characters we come to know and love are faced with challenges that cause immense personal growth... and not always for the better. But even when they make poor decisions, the reader usually feels sympathetic and understands the reasons for those decisions. I can't help but wonder what I would do in their shoes, faced with the same dire circumstances and baffling moral ambiguities.<br /><br />Like Lord of the Rings, this tale is rich in history... almost too rich for some.

0679428895|3.0|so i purchased `pompeii' at the airport for some light travel reading, on the strength of ellipse-filled but positive reviews on the cover from respected rags including the NY Times and The Economist, \\"terrific..gripping...\\"  etc.  it performed well-enough, though not as good as the reviews indicated; it feels a little formulaic, thrown together and ultimately flat.  the pages keep turning at a reasonable pace, but i kept having a certain `color by numbers' feeling not unlike reading the machine-produced recent novels from tom clancy.  i'm obviously no connoisseur of the light fiction genre, but i'd have to recommend `da vinci code' or katherine neville's excellent `the eight' long before i'd tell anyone to buy this.  the one thing from this novel worth thinking about, with my own ellipsis:  harris clearly has an undue influence on the biggest reviewing publications in the world....
B0002IU988|5.0|I have to be honest up front, I was never a big \\"Creed\\" fan.  Scott Stapp's rediculously throaty vocals just totally ruined it for me.  I just couldn't get past the LAME vocals.  Well.....those days are gone!  ALter Bridge is absolutely killer.  Myles Kennedy's voice is absolutely killer!  He has power, range, dynamics, style, and he \\"gets it\\"!  The writing on this albums is excellent, but i think what carry's it are the performances by Kennedy, and moreover, the obvious \\"attitude\\" in Mark Tremonti's playing.  It seems to me that he had something to prove, and man oh man, he has proven it! After hearing Scott Stapp's horrid rendition of \\"God Bless America\\" during the World Series, and after letting this CD sink in, it seems to me that Stapp must be absolutely kicking himself!
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|I love Shania and think the new song Party For Two is great, and even better when it rocks with Mark. But the last song I Ain't No Quitter is awful. The worst song I think she has ever done. I guess I like the pop side of Shania more, than the country side. This cd has all her country versions and not the pop. So I was disappointed.  I know the artists has to sway for the way country is moving, but I think it won't sell as much.Sorry Shania, release You Shook Me All Night Long on the rock stations, and you would be a bigger hit!
0634022296|3.0|This book contains complete lyrics and chords to all of the Beatles original compositions, it is very accurate.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately due to the number of pages and style of binding the book will not stay open.  This great book is rendered USELESS by the bulky binding.   <br /> <br />I suggest, instead buying the \\"Beatles Fake Book\\" by Hal-Leonard publishing ISBN: 0881887579.  The Fake Book also contains the songs by other artists that the Beatles covered and it uses a comb binding that allows the book to stay open. <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania has picked all the best songs that she has ever recorded for this CD.  Any Shania fan must have this CD in the collection.  There are even new songs added including 2 versions of \\"Party for Two\\" and it is great to hear them both.

The best new album that I've purchased in as long as I can remember.
B000002TYX|3.0|If you want to hear outakes and rare tracks by The Beatles because you are a big fan this will be great(like it was for me). But if you only casually listen to the band you would probably be better off with 1. And if you want to find out more about the bands history I would recomend the Anthology dvd's which is actually better than the cds in my opinion.  <br /> <br />And I would also like to state that I love Free As A Bird. I think people are to hard on it. I think it is a great song and even though John's voice isn't the clearest I like the way it sounds(very haughnting). After all let's not forget it cracked the top 20 on billboard, not bad for three old guys and someone who had died almost 15 years earlier.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The second film in a series makes or breaks a potential franchise. If the second Bond film had done poorly there's no doubt that that would have been the end. The same for the \\"Star Trek\\" film series (featuring either the original stars or \\"The Next Generation\\"). So the industry paid close attention to \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\". Had Matt Damon metamorphosed into an action star or was the first film just a fluke? \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" proved that Damon and the potential of this film series passed the litmus test. Taking up where the first film ended, Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA assassination forcing him to go on the run. He and Marie (Franka Potente) must pull up stakes in the sleepy seaside town where they've begun to make a life together. Bourne retaliates against the agents he used to call friends when he was an assassin in an intricate game of cat and mouse comparable to the first film. A warning about the film if you have a weak stomach is that much of this was shot using handheld cameras and creates the impression of a wild amusement ride during the action sequences. You may want to have your motion sickness pills close at hand.<br /><br /> Avoiding the spooky look of traditional cloak and dagger films, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" has the more modern jittery look of films like \\"Die Hard\\". The colors weren't vibrant in the original film but fairly subdued most of the time and they are well reproduced here with a sharp, clear and clean picture full of solid blacks. There's a touch of edge enhancement during a couple of sequences but it's kept to a minimum and is, for the most part, fairly subtle. The booming sound of the production receives a lively transfer using the surround speakers for maximum effect. One advantage of an action-thriller is that things are always faster, louder and over dramatic and those very qualities come alive in the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix.<br /><br />Like the original film (and its recent double dip DVD re-release), \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" makes the most of the DVD format with some stunning examples in the way of extras. While the featurettes could have been combined into one larger documentary, the Special Features Producer evidently felt that the audience for this film had untreated ADHD as the longest featurette runs about 7 minutes. With nine featurettes included on the making of the film, fans will get an exhaustive glimpse behind the curtain at how the various effects were achieved for the film. Beginning with \\"Casting\\" we hear from director Greengrass about the challenges of selecting a strong personality and powerful actor to hold his or her own with actors like Brian Cox on screen. \\"Keeping It Real\\", \\"Blowing Things Up\\" and \\"On the Move with Jason Bourne\\" focus on everything from the location shooting in Moscow, the various physical effects employed on the set to create the spectacular action sequences and how the crew made it seem as if Matt Damon was doing all the driving in the riveting chase sequences. Damon also discusses some of the stunt driving training that he underwent for the sequences where he was behind the wheel. While he wasn't alone (I don't want to spoil it for you), it clearly gave him the confidence as an actor to believe he was driving the vehicle while in character.<br /><br />There's also a discussion of how some of the more complex camera moves were achieved during the shooting of the film. \\"The Go-Mobile Revs up the Action\\" discusses the device they used to achieve the look of Damon driving and allowed some of the dangerous driving stunts appear even more dangerous on film. Featuring both producer Frank Marshall and Matt Damon, this sequence breaks down how these sequences were broken up so that the most amazing shots could be done with Damon actually in the action.  \\"Anatomy of a Scene\\" breaks down the sequence near the conclusion involving a bridge chase, a jump off the bridge and landing on a barge. The final featurette has composer John Powell discussing his approach to scoring the film. A warning on all of these featurettes-don't want them until you see the movie otherwise the entire film will be spoiled for you.<br /><br />Some of the deleted scenes add character moments for Brian Cox, Joan Allen, Matt Damon and other cast members but would have slowed down the film. While they are importantly sequences (and are of the type that will probably be incorporated into a \\"Director's Cut\\" ten years down the line) for the characters, they don't add anything to the story itself and slow down the overall momentum of the film.<br /><br />A strong sequel to the first film, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" can stand on its own as a strong extension of the original thriller. The image quality is quite good. Keep in mind the washed out quality of the images and the slightly greenish tinge in many of the interior sequences was intended. With a nine featurettes that combined run about 46 minutes, the reality is that all nine featurettes could have easily been integrated into a single documentary on the making of the film. With scene access you would have gotten about the same results as the featurettes.  A fine film that may have you reaching for your armrest to hold on for a wild ride, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" will keep you on the edge of your seat.owell discussing his approach to scoring the film.

B00005JMXX|3.0|This flick put me in mind of Irwin Allen's disaster movies from the 70s with its overdone plot and Disaster On An Epic scale premise. The laughable dialogue and silly twists entertain only because they're so bad. Frankly, I'd rather watch \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" or \\"The Towering Inferno\\" because the theme songs were better, and although computer-generated special effects are de rigeur today, I still think they look cartoonish
B0006284JQ|5.0|I don't see what the negative reviews are about.  People knew exactly what to expect with this album. <br />It's a great collection of pop tunes, that's it.  If you're a fan of the genre, you'll surely find something to like.  The beats are infectious, the chorus' catchy, and the lyrics are fun and upbeat for the most part.  No matter how you feel about Britney's persona, there is no denying that she's put out some of the best pop songs of the last 10 years.
B0006284JQ|5.0|...'Britney Spears' was the name on everyone's lips when she exploded onto the Pop scene with her monstrous debut single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" ... and with hit-after-hit-after-hit that followed, it was clear that this girl was going to have more than just 15 minutes of fame. <br /> <br />Although her fan-base has decreased heavily in numbers due to her maturing sound and outrageous image, loyal Britney fans are still here and are enjoying everything she has to offer. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative has 17 tracks to offer - and you will surely be keeping this album on repeat for quite sometime. It's a non-stop session of musical genius in the form of manufactured bubble-gum Pop and matured, no-strings-attached Pop. <br /> <br />You have all of her singles here ... with the exception of 3 (\\"I Love Rock In Roll\\", \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\") ... so we're left without a pretty average cover of a Rock classic, without the beautiful ballad that is `DLMBTLTK' (written by Shania Twain and Mutt Lange), and without the semi-decent ballad `FTBOMBH'. It's a shame, but oh well - we're also given 3 `new' songs ... but in reality, we're just given 2 `new' songs - them being Britney's current (and possibly only single from this album) \\"My Prerogative\\" and the previously unreleased \\"Do Somethin'\\" (from the In The Zone sessions). \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" has been available to fans since the original release of Brit's third album In The Zone. It was an exclusive through Wal-Mart, and as soon as iTunes got a hold of this track, it became a best-seller ... apparently, since it was so in demand, it found its way onto the Greatest Hits: My Prerogative track-listing. The song, anyway, \\"IJB(HMF)\\", is a decent Pop song. Nothing too special. <br /> <br />For those who've yet to hear \\"Do Somethin'\\" - you'll be surprised to learn that it's the most un-Britney-like track that you'll ever listen to. Listeners will surely compare this songto Gwen Stefani's \\"What You Waiting For?\\" - and this song does sound relatively like Gwen's song. Think of a cross between the In The Zone tracks \\"Brave New Girl\\" and \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" ... if you like those tracks, you'll without a doubt like this one. But don't expect \\"Do Somethin'\\" to be the second single. Britney's already on break to focus on her family life. <br /> <br />With that said, Greatest Hits: My Prerogative will surely keep you entertained for hours and hours. From \\"Toxic\\" to \\"Boys (Co-Ed Remix)\\" to \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" to \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", you'll surely be on your feet wanting more and more great Pop songs to lose yourself to. And with this album, you have nothing to worry about (..except when the ballads come along. Then things tone down!) ... This album features the Stop! Remix of \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", which in my opinion, is so much better than the album version on ...Baby One More Time.  <br /> <br />There's not much more to say, except that if you happen to buy the Limited Edition, you'll be treating yourself to a bonus CD with 5 remixes, mixes of \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Everytime\\", and a Mega-Mix done by Chris Cox. The only mix I found myself disappointed by was the \\"Breathe On Me\\" mix ... <br /> <br />The music of Britney Spears, without a doubt, has got to be some of the best Pop music ever released. Certainly some of the best music released in the past 6 years. And even as Hip-Hop continues to dominate the current U.S. music scene, Britney's music is always easily finding its way to bring some variety and excitement to a rather disappointing music scene that will hopefully fall within the next couple of years. Unfortunately, though, this may be the last time we ever see a new Britney album. Now that she's a wife and wants to focus more on her family life, she may decide to permanently settle - and at the best time too, after years of hard work, fame, success, and stress. <br /> <br />I'll always be a fan of Britney. Her music is just awesome and I don't think there'll be another like her.
B000067CPX|4.0|I wouldn't immediatly rush to cal this album or any by the RCHP to be my kinda music but there are some iconic songs on this album - Venice Queen, Cant Stop and Midnight to name but a few. Well worth the asking price.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania is one of my favorite artists, and her mass appeal has won her throngs of fans worldwide. For a lover of many genres like myself, she combines country sensibilities and lyrics with pop hooks. She has an uncanny ability, along with Mutt, to combine multiple styles. \\"From This Moment On\\", a beatiful love song, is country crossed with an AC power ballad and a tinge of Spanish music. These songs are catchy as hell: if you listened to country in 1995, you had \\"Any Man of Mine\\" memorized. \\"You're Still the One\\" is a classic crossover smash that you can still hear daily on the radio and is a popular wedding song. And \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" is an anthem. Shania can make you dance, laugh, yell, and cry all on the same album. Her \\"Greatest Hits\\" also has a complete lyric book with pictures from the corresponding videos. And the three new songs are great; \\"Party for Two\\" is sexy and fun in either version; \\"Don't\\" is a beautiful ballad; \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is strait (sp) up country (Take that Nashville!). If you've ever liked one of these songs or all of them, buy this album. It leaves out songs, but at 21 tracks, who can complain-besides, Shania fans have all of the albums anyway. Add this to your collection today, and have fun all winter.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung is U2's second best album to The Joshua Tree, so, if you're getting into them, get the latter, then the former. Anyway, I'm getting off track. This is just really cool. It starts out with Zoo Station which sends chills up my spine, goes through some great rockers, then ends with the slow \\"Love Is Blindness\\". Yet, one thing I realized while listening to this was; this is wierd. Really, really wierd. But it's great. Get it now, even though it takes a few listens to appreciate. It's worth it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I found it very sad to read some of the other reviews for this film. It appears to the rest of the world that Americans cannot accept criticism and one other reviewer (you know who you are!) proved the point true exactly! I am English and am thoroughly ashamed of our Prime Minister's role in this 'war' and can only sympathise with the American people for what they have to live with! All that Michael Moore does in this film is highlight the facts that already exist. It would seem that most of the non-American world already knew these facts, but the ones they didn't only serve to inform and educate us all of the ridiculousness of the times we live in.
0156027321|5.0|I'm an avid reader, usually a book per week, and this book is the best I've read in the past year, maybe longer. It is brilliantly imagined, impeccably written, whimsical, funny and thougtful all at once. There's always a danger in building a book up too much for other readers, so I'll just say this: this book reminded me why I read and what fiction is supposed to do for us. I was SMILING as I read it.  <br />I agree with the below reviewer that the \\"believe in God\\" promise isn't quite delivered on, but that didn't compromise the book for me. The book made me believe in the power of storytelling, which goes a very long way on a rainy day. <br /> <br />Buy it in hardback. I'd bet good money this will be one day be considered a classic. <br /> <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is ture to her music and I am sure this is going to be a very good CD. I just ordered it off HMV an I ant wate to get it. We have a few  Canadain singers out there that are grwat but Shania Twain is the best!
0060005424|5.0|I read all three books in the series and I was taken into a whole new world. The detail with which Nix writes his books is extraodinary. His ideas are ingenius. All of the time it must have taken to write this book has to have been worth it. I believe anything is possible and even though  know this story can't be true, Nix makes it seem so real. I look forward to reading more of his work very soon.
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|Man, this woman is simply gorgeous!!! And gorgeous in a natural, simple way, and not a silicon-Botox-fake blond way. But that would be useless if she could not act. But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called \\"Pearl Harbor\\"). She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of \\"fuel\\" (Carrie Ann-Moss should have learned from her when she played \\"TRINITY\\" in both sequences of MATRIX...)<br /><br />And, sometimes, I just don't understand critics. This movie received a lot of backlash. Sue, it's far away from perfect, but critics are always complaining of brainless action flicks, with no substance (Bruckheimer-kind of movies)... UNERWORLD is nothing liek that. It constructs its history slowly and carefully, until reaching its climax.
B000063DI9|5.0|Yes this is true. I was 9 (maybe 10) years old when I first heard the song \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" from a mix tape that a friend of my older brother made, which also included some other Maiden songs like \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", as well as some Manowar, Danzig, and Anthrax (but I'll save those bands for another review). But \\"Madness\\" was the first song I heard and I was instantly hooked and blown away. I can honestly say that I became a fan right away and immediatly went out and bought \\"7th Son\\" as well as \\"Number of the Beast\\"(my other favorite), \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"Killers\\" (to hear the original singer). There is absolutly NO vocalist that can even come close to matching Bruce 'the air raid siren' Dickinson. <br /> <br />Now how about THIS album? First off, this, in my opinion was their last 5 star album (they just lacked luster after that. Not that they weren't awesome afterwards but after the exiting of Adrian Smith it just wasn't the same)Every track is worth several listens with the volume cranked to it's capacity. <br /> <br />Highlights: Moonchild, Infinite Dreams, Can I Play With Madness, title track, ...AW HELL! Just the whole damn album! So get off it and buy the damn thing if you don't have it. Especially if you're a young one who wants to hear what real metal is supposed to sound like! Move your Slipknot and System of a Down to the side and expand your little metal minds! <br />UP THE IRONS!
0783228007|2.0|Apart from some impressive scenery and a nifty train-wreck climax, Clint Eastwood's \\"Joe Kidd\\" (1972) is an uninspired, dreary affair that resembles a made-for-TV movie. Director John Sturges simply goes through the motions and a fine supporting cast (including Robert Duvall and John Saxon) is wasted. Judging by the film's lackluster quality, it's easy to see why Eastwood directed his remaining Westerns.
B000056HE9|5.0|I love The Bishop's Wife.  This movie is so charming, funny and warm that its mood is completely contagious. Grant is wonderful as the angel, Dudley, and Young and Niven are equally fine as his assignment. Lessons about what's important in life and where your priorities should lie are all here - wrapped up in a big, cheerful bow. This is a great feel-good movie and a true holiday classic.<br /><br />PS: Do not confuse this with the awful The Preachers Wife and let it scare you away from this gem.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatres. It's the only movie I've ever walked out on. It was boring, stupid, and the characters were pitiful.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|Very, very funny holiday film.  Clark has a bit of all Dads everywhere in his character and there are so many relatable, yet thankfully exagerated, moments in this film that you would need to be the ultimate scrooge to not get a good laugh out of this. The perfect antidote to the more sentimental holiday offerings and a damn good time!
0345440900|5.0|I read this book when my child was about 6 weeks old. It taught me a bit more about reading my son, and following his lead. The scheduling has helped my husband and I tremendously to have a life with harmony and time to ourselves. The EASY is really true since your baby is really born with an internal clock that we all tend to mess up for lack of knowledge on how to read him.  I recommend this book as a simple and easy-to-read guide that addresses real-life examples.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Shania Twain has finally released a greatest hits collection.  This is an easy way to get the best songs from each of the albums that she released with Mutt Lange at the helm.  However, she forgot two songs from her debut: \\"Dance with the One that Brought You\\" and \\"What Made You Say That.\\"  I think she should have added these two, even though she did not have the huge hits the other songs were.   <br /> <br />That being said, this collection is excellent.  Ms. Twain knows what it takes to make a hit song. Her gifts are definitely misunderstood by Nashville, but she left that town in her dust.  This is definitely worth obtaining and keeping!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Well let me begin by saying the Record Label (Jive) should have called it THE SINGLES: MY PREROGATIVE, not Greatest hits, but other than that the album suceeds on so many levels. <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative  <br />2. Toxic   <br />3. I'm A Slave 4 U  <br />4. Oops!...I Did It Again     <br />5. Me Against The Music feat. Madonna    <br />6. Stronger   <br />7. Everytime   <br />8. ...Baby One More Time     <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!)       <br />10. Boys   <br />11. Sometimes     <br />12. Overprotected (The Darkchild Remix)     <br />13. Lucky     <br />14. Outrageous     <br />15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman   <br />16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)   <br />17. Do Somethin'   <br /> <br />First, the album starts with her \\"new\\" single My Prerogative, which she took over, her own Britney Style is excellent. Her voice tends to seduct the audience. Then the begining starts with her more recent hits like Toxic and MATM ft. Madonna, then the middle covers her early hits like stronger and Hit me Baby....Then the ending caps off with two new songs which fit Britney recent tastes techno/pop. <br /> <br />Fans are critizing her more rencent stuff which is pretty bias of them, first off, Britney isnt always going to be POP BUBBLE GUM PRINCESS! she isnt going to sing songs like BABY ONE MORE TIME and CRAZY, she grew up, she went to different kinds of music, and fans always think that Britney is going to stay the same, well people, she reinvents her self always and i guess she reinvents herself through music also. <br /> <br />Whether you like it or not, this is the new Britney, and if fans dont accept her well then to bad. This \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is an excellent one, full of \\"classic\\" britney songs. ANY BRITNEY fans needs this album. An excellent way to top off 5 fantastic years of an amazing artist.
0345456343|5.0|Anne Rice is positively the best writer ever. I am a frequent reviewer of her novels, espcially Blood Canticle. People have read it and either gave it bad ratings or good, or else they say that they hate my review. Frankly, I don't care what they say, as long as I'm heard. Anyhow, Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned are my second best favourites to Blood Canticle. I've actually written Ms. Rice, and she has replied back. That was over the contraversy about Blood Canticle. I congradulated her work on the novel, and gave her my opinion of her books. I've read all the Vampire Chronicles, and the New Tales of the Vampires. I also dabbled in her Lives of the Mayfair Wiches novels and found them just as delightful. All in all, I congradulate her work.
B000000JO3|1.0|To start this off, this is a serious review and yes I do own this cd.  Most people on here seem to think this cd is brilliant, I simply cannot understand, they have no talent for songwritting, or as musicians.  Every song sounds just like the last, I dont even see the energy in this cd...and I thought thats what punk was supposed to be about.  If you like punk-ish stuff but want a band that actaully has talent check out early Thrice (new thrice is good to, but its more emo).
0767830555|5.0|Short and Sweet, DeNiro, Scorsese, Foster, Kietel, Sheppard and others are brought together to mak the best character study ever, it is slow but intriguing and superbly directed, it captures the characteristics of madness and sleaze and you can relate to Travis Bickle (DeNiro) in every way, even though he is a raging lunatic who his quite contempt to blowing a few pimp's heads off. It is superbly performed and pulled of and that is why it deserves its five stars and recognition.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is by far the best Rock Album I've heard in a long time.  Simple but feeling filled lyrics- haunting musical accompaniment- all the stuff that makes a great new age CD.
0553212737|5.0|When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities. <br /> <br />At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for  everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.  <br /> <br />The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.  <br /> <br />These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.  <br /> <br />The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author.
0060930187|5.0|The book I thought was wonderful, but I had a question I had hoped someone could answer.  Why after her suicide attempt was her face brusied and swollen and why was her hair all but gone.  She never explained what happened- does anyone have any insight?  Thanks!
B00000294R|5.0|for all the avid tupac fans, no disrespect but L is hands-down the best that ever did it. this album is a CLASSIC, L's flow and punchlines are AMAZING (betta than lloyd banks, by far) <br /> <br />if you don't have this album you need to get it, i'm not being biased, this is in te top 5 albums ever. <br /> <br />Lamont \\"Big L\\" Colemen R.I.P.
B0000028RR|5.0|What a hell of an album. I can't describe how great this rock album is. some rockers and metalheads think that Rage sucks because of Zachs rapping. But Then again Morellos guitar riffs make up for it.  This album stands out as a classic. This band stands out for true rock music. and back then when music was good and artist werent money hungry and were all about the music. Now new bands suck as$ like evanecense, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte and such.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album represents the peak of Metallica's musical ambitions. This album is an absolute monster with the shortest track clocking in at 5:12 and the longest 9:48. The review below that claims that Metallica sold out here is laughable. The only song here with any mainstream appeal is \\"one\\".  This isn't Metallica's first foray into progressive metal but never before had they attempted it on this scale. The long drawn out songs added to the tinny drum and barely audible bass makes this album unewelcoming at first. However, repeated listens will gradually reveal the album's worth.   Thematically this album is very strong and the lyrics are excellent. Seriously, read the lyric sheet for this album alongside St Anger's. It is utterly baffling that the band could have written the same lyrics, and produced the same music for that matter.  I would rate this album as on a par with Ride The Lightning although the two are very different albums. This one is far less accessible, more cerebral, but no less rewarding.   I agree with the amazon review; I can only wondered what future albums would have sounded like had the band continued down this route. We can only fantasize.
B000089RVX|1.0|Join SOG because SOG is a cool clan. SOG stands for Survivors Of Girls. if you really hate this band then you should pick up Some Snoop Dogg Records. Snoop Dogg is a real band and so is Dr Dre. Snoop Dogg can really put up a show because their vocalist and their guitarist is really good. LOL!!!!!!!!!
0812968255|5.0|It was interesting to see that one reviewer went looking for a copy of the Modern Library edition of \\"Meditations\\" as a gift, and had to settle for a different translation.    There was a time when many publishers had in print their own editions -- usually \\"gift editions,\\" in a range of prices -- of the little book, \\"To Himself,\\" by the second-century Roman patrician Marcus Annius Catilius Severus (121-180 C.E.), known after his marriage as Marcus Annius Verus -- almost always titled something like \\"The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,\\" and most commonly some version (little choice disguised as many choices) of George Long's 1862 translation of the Greek original, originally published as \\"The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus.\\"    For Marcus, besides receiving an excellent education in Greek, which he seems to have used as naturally as Latin, went on, through a process of adoption and co-optation, to rule the Roman Empire, beginning in 161 with the death of Antoninus Pius, his uncle, who had adopted him as heir, using a third version of his name. For moderns, he is usually just Marcus Aurelius; I found it a bit of shock to see him as just another \\"Antoninus\\" in ancient texts.    Under any name, he has been popular, at least with publishers; even now, there seem to be something like sixty versions in English of this book available on Amazon, even though many *are* out of print (and most seem to be of the same few older translations). As usual, a number of these editions and translations are grouped by Amazon for review purposes, and I will mention some. If you find this, or someone else's, review of one translation under a different heading, PLEASE remember that, as Marcus Aurelius saw, some things really are beyond our control.    It should require more thought to understand Marcus than it does to follow the English version. The Modern Library's current offering, a new translation by George Hays, is based on modern text editions, and seems to be both an excellent first introduction to the book, and graceful reading for those with no interest in looking further. It has brief but helpful notes, and a glossary of names, which helps keep the notes short and to the point. Some will follow his references to more advanced treatments, including textual as well as philosophical problems.    As for Marcus Aurelius, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest, and certainly the most morally and intellectually impressive, of all Roman Emperors. Gibbon tended to see the Empire's real decline as subsequent to his death, a view not without its reflection in the recent motion picture \\"Gladiator.\\" The transitions by appointment from Trajan to Hadrian to Antoninus Pius to Marcus produced one of the most successful set of reigns in history (if mainly from a strictly Roman and Imperial point of view). It is perhaps the best historically-documented counterpart of the Chinese tradition of the Sage Emperors who chose as heirs the Most Virtuous (or Most Effective) subjects, instead of favored sons.    The policy had precedents in Roman history, although none so successful for so long. Family loyalty was admired, and inheritance gave access to key property, including the slaves in the bureaucracy, and the loyalty of followers (veteran soldiers, freedmen and other clients); yet the whole dynastic principle was suspect as un-Roman. It was in part accidental, Antoninus, for example, himself almost a last-minute substitute, having no son to be his heir. Marcus Aurelius designated his son Commodus as successor, with less fortunate consequences, after the death of his first choice; although Commodus' evil reputation may reflect his political and military failures, and the interests of his successors, as much as his personality.    So one might expect from the great Emperor Marcus Aurelius some manifesto on statesmanship, or imperial strategy, or at least good government. In fact, his twelve books (booklets, really) of little notes \\"to himself\\" contain reflections on fate, on moral lessons from classical literature, on religion, on human nature. They are probably the last thing one would expect of a Supreme Autocrat and Generalissimo.    Nor are they an exposition of a philosophic system; no surprise that some reviewers, apparently expecting one, have found them unsatisfying.    The first three books have titles (some are subscripts in the manuscript tradition, but, like Hays, I think they are misplaced). \\"On the River Gran, Among the Quadi,\\" refers to a campaign on the borders of the empire. If it is the heading of Book Two, the lack of any explicit reference therein to the hard-fought German campaign is worth pondering. Was this what the Emperor considered truly important? What he wanted us to think he thought was important? (But there is internal evidence that he had no intention of making any of it public.) What he preferred to think about when he could get away from the war for a few moments? It should be remembered that he was a successful campaigner.    Hays' clear translation into modern English joins a number of post-Long translations. Older versions include the important version with commentary of A.S.L. Farquharson (Oxford, 1944, out of print; his translation with new introduction, etc., World's Classics, 1990, and Oxford World's Classics, 1998), and two competitors for the student and general reader markets, respectively, by G.M.A. Grube (originally Library of Liberal Arts, Bobbs-Merrill, 1963) and Maxwell Staniforth (Penguin Classics, 1964), which have been in and out of print (but mostly in) for four decades. Of these, I much prefer Hays -- although the additional material in the World's Classics edition(s) is worth a look. (Staniforth, by the way, says that \\"a couple of generations ago\\" major publishers had \\"elegant miniature\\" editions of classics, usually including the \\"Meditations\\" -- those I remember from the 1960s themselves were full-sized, and distinguished only by gilt edges and/orslipcovers and/or presentation pages.)    It also joins the highly-praised contemporary version, \\"The Emperor's Handbook: A New Translation of The Meditations,\\" translated by David Hicks and C. Scott Hicks (2002; not seen).    It competes as well with a fairly recent (1993) Dover Thrift Edition of the George Long translation, revised (and not for the first time) to modernize his mid-Victorian English and untangle his somewhat convoluted fidelity to (a long-obsolete edition of) the Greek. That Long was not very readable was probably not of much concern to those who used to buy and give (and possibly receive) editions designed to suggest educated tastes; certainly not to the sellers. Long's concern for accuracy should be emulated, but turning relatively clear Greek into opaque English doesn't seem the best way to achieve the goal. (In all fairness, what was plain enough language in mid-Victorian England / Civil War America may now seem obscure for other reasons.)    The novelist Mary Renault thought that Marcus' example refuted Lord Acton's view that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\\" but the most remarkable lesson of the \\"Meditations\\" is that Marcus Aurelius did not believe that he HAD absolute power. He had been chosen and groomed for a role he had been taught to accept as a duty, and regarded it as both an obligation and an imposition. For Marcus was a Stoic -- not in the commonplace sense of someone who repressed his feelings or endured pain without expression, but in the original sense of a follower of philosophy that offered a quasi-religious approach to life. Hays usefully points out (with helpful bibliography) that Marcus was, in the manner of his time, eclectic, but grants that, if asked, he would have identified himself with Stocism.    The movement was founded by Zeno of Citium (or Kition), born on Cyprus (about 336 B.C.E.) in a family said to be part Phoenician, who taught in the Stoa Poikile, or \\"Painted Walkway,\\" in Athens, from some point after 313 to his death about 261 B.C.E. It was one of the key movements of Hellenistic times, and found a ready reception among upper class Romans as well. Teaching calm in the face of stress, and endorsing acceptance of public obligations, including religion, it is traditionally paired with, and contrasted to, Epicureanism, which taught avoidance of excessive pain and pleasure, withdrawal into private life, and the pointlessness of traditional religion. (Not hedonism, as popularly imagined; nor did it deny the existence of gods, only that they had any interest in anything so trivial and base as human concerns.)    For those who find the \\"Meditations\\" intriguing but unsatisfying, works by other Stoics may be more fulfilling; there are some excellent recent volumes translating and interpreting Marcus' older contemporary, Epictetus, a slave who set an example to the rulers of the western world -- but that would be another review.

B000268QB2|5.0|What make Keane special is that they write toweringly seductive and addictive songs that have layers of soul. What makes the critics hate them is they are just too nice.  Not very rock n roll.  Maybe it is the lack of guitars. That's actually what I like about it. Nobody would dare not to have a guitar on something that is pitched for the alternative rock crowd.   <br />As fan of everything from Bloc Party and the Pixies to Orbital and the Prodigy to god know what else, I would suggest you leave all prejudices aside.  I have.  No labels need be placed. <br />I have reviewed many an album for many a year for regional papers in the UK and there are only a few bands that flick the switch that says special. Radiohead did it.  Nirvana. Pixies.  Coldplay. Bands whose music will endure. Will sound fresh with the passing of time <br />This stands that test. There is not a duff track here.  <br />They will be massive.  I have just come back from seeing them in Glasgow, Scotland and I have never heard a crowd go so beserk over a band in the eons of years I have gone to live gigs. <br />Stand out tracks?  Somewhere Only We Know, Sunshine, Bend and Break, Everybody's Changing, Bedshaped, We Might as Well Be Strangers, This Is The Last Time and oh, b sides like Fly To Me must be checked out.  You could fill an album with cracking songs that are not on the album.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I bought a tape of this when it first came out, and before CD's were all the rage. Several years ago my tape broke, and somehow I never got around to replacing it. That said, I loved this release, and would rank it as one of Simon's best solo albums. The magic he encounters when he immerses himself in this music is outstanding and I'm surprised on one has reviewed this cd.

B0002YLC24|4.0|First off, if you haven't already seen the first film, \\"Before Sunrise,\\" also from director Richard Linklater, then stop and go rent or buy that film for a solid romantic backstory.  After that, this film is an excellent continuation with all the fantastic acting nuance and phenomenal chemistry that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still have.  Richard Linklater even used these two actors for an scene in the animated film \\"Waking Life\\" to great effect.  Most of \\"Before Sunset\\" is basically one long conversation between two former one-night-stand lovers talking about where they are now in life, where they've been, where they think they are going, what they believe in, whether or not \\"love\\" is a luxury they simply cannot afford in their now too complicated lives.  Ultimately, this is a very realistic look at intimacy, all the while hoping these two do end up together.  The only \\"flaws\\" in the film are two-fold(particularly for hopeless romantics): 1)the film is too short, 2)the film is very linear.  You want these two to go on forever connecting, all the while only a glance away from a passionate embrace.  By \\"linear,\\" I mean that nothing especially exciting happens during the film other than a re-awakening of long-dormant emotions let loose in the Parisian dusk through conversation and walking from location to location.  However, this is a very good film with some great chemistry between the principle actors, and an excellent continuation from the underground hit that was \\"Before Sunrise.\\"  Both are worth owning, especially if you believe in love.  Thank you.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I've never been a huge Puccini-Fan but this recording will always be very dear to me. I bought it ages ago on vinyl and had the grand dame sign it. Her Turandot sounds splendid and gorgeous, I like her more velvety sound, prefer it over the metallic sound of the dramatic sopranos, and here I prefer her to Callas who simply recorded it too late. Pavarotti is the most charming Calaf I know, even though I saw Corelli in the role and adored him. Caballe sings a most lovely Liu. This recording is a keeper!
B00001IVOR|3.0|the name of this double cd says it all: \\"forever.\\" which is about how long it feels as though this double cd goes on for. and considering that there is just about enough really good material here for a single cd, that's not a good thing. while there are some great songs on here (triumph, mgm, etc.) it is just too bloated with contributions from people like cappadonna, killa priest, etc. who drag the album down. as somebody already said, if you can get it cheap, then do so. then burn all the really good songs onto a single cd and you'll be good to go.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Well I won't go into too much detail, as everyone else has already written enough on that...but I will say this is one perfect albumn from start to finish. The songwriting for Nightwish has always been outstanding, and they are definitely exploring new sounds with each release, yet still keeping the same core elements that make them so unique and amazing. Tarja is THE female in the world of female vocals...so if you like music with pretty voices, buy this now. If you like metal buy this. If you like fantasy, buy this. If you like romance, buy this. If you like good songwriting, buy this. <br /> <br />I've been a fan of this band for 8 years now, and finally they are starting to get SOME recognition for their work and talent. If MTV didn't run the world, this band would be in the top 10. As it is...they are on the verge of exploding in the US...so get into them now before everyone else does! :-)
068987474X|5.0|After being out of the dating world for 11 years, this book has been very helpful to a newly single 40ish woman.  I am sharing it with all of my single friends!!!
068987474X|3.0|This breezy book, written in trendy language with large print and lots of white space, is a fast read.  As a disclaimer, I don't watch Oprah or SATC but I see from previous reviews that Oprah gave the book a big  sales push.<br /><br />  First off, girls, we have intuition and the overwhelming majority of us KNOW when someone is interested and when he is not. Regardless if he's brash or shy, bombastic or sweetly soft-spoken, pushy or retiring, we know.  Men cannot be lumped together into one \\"he\\" just as women cannot be one \\"she\\".<br /><br />  Secondly, we women are \\"hard-wired\\" for connectedness; thank God for that, or the human race would not continue.  If you're one of those who beats herself up for getting emotional, and for dreaming of nesting with a  man and nurturing children, stop it right now! There is no guilt involved, there is no shame. Remember even Gloria Steinem, famous for her statement, \\"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,\\" eventually did marry.<br /><br />  The third point is a caution:  Many women are attracted by the players, those bad boys, who seem to promise so much fun, adventure, and romance, but who often are too immature to deliver<br />what we women are seeking.  The book's author, Greg, seems to know a lot of those guys!  Yes, ladies, chemistry is vitally important, but there are many good guys who will make your heart zing, so don't bother with the bad ones.  That's the core message of this book:  Don't bother with the bad ones.  Don't \\"waste the pretty\\" by agonizing over player-behavior.<br /><br />  Fourth point, cannot be emphasized too strongly:  Some male reviewers have already written well about this.  Men like women.  Take care of yourself, use perfume, smile and be friendly to everyone whenever and wherever.  Life is full of surprises. You may \\"meet cute\\" as in the movies, so be ready!<br /><br />  Fifth, a wise old folk saying: \\"He chased her until she caught him.\\"  Let your radar guide you, girls, as men are individuals and cannot be treated all the same.  Generally, however: do not be overly needy, do not stalk or bombard with phone calls or gifts, but do be warm and responsive and always interested in what interests your guy.  Let it develop naturally between you, let trust grow along with love.  You don't need to become cynical, and you don't need a formula, and you don't really even need to read yet another book!  Respect yourself, don't warp yourself into knots trying to follow some rules or be someone you are not.  Remember, men LIKE women.  Just keep showing up!he same.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|It's about time Shania released a Greatest Hits album! <br />She does not disappoint with this collection of hits spanning from \\"The Woman In Me\\" to \\"Up!\\". It's a feel good album complete with Shania's signature country sound. Songs such as \\"Forever and For Always\\" and \\"You're Still the One\\" reflect Shania's thoughtful and romantic abilities as a songwriter, while songs like \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman\\" and \\"Any Man of Mine\\" show her strength as a woman and ability to have fun. As with any greatest hits album, Shania includes some new songs, including my favorite \\"Party For Two\\" with Billy Currington (country version) and Mark McGrath (pop version). If the album isn't already worth getting, this song will make you want to purchase it. Now I can't wait to get the DVD!

6303407161|5.0|\\"The $64,000 Challenge.\\"  \\"Twenty One.\\"  \\"Tic Tac Dough.\\"  In the 1950s, America was in love with television game shows.  But, little did the public know that things were not well at the television networks.  Many game shows were rigged, contestants cheated, and integrity was given up for money and higher ratings.  \\"Quiz Show,\\" the 1994 movie directed by Robert Redford, takes a painful and memorable look at the television game show scandals of 1958. <br /> <br />\\"Quiz Show\\" is based off the true story of Richard Goodwin, the lawyer who uncovered the scandal of the popular NBC quiz show \\"Twenty One.\\"  When ratings begin to fall of the show, David Paymer, playing \\"Twenty One\\" producer Dan Enwright, blames the geeky long-standing champion Herb Stempel, comically played by John Turturro, for the show's troubles. <br /> <br />Enwright recruits another contestant, a handsome, refined college professor named Charles Van Doren (played by Ralph Fiennes), whom he feels will gain public approval and help ratings.  To ensure that Van Doren stays on television, Enwright insists that Van Doren receive the answers to questions asked on the show in advance. <br /> <br />Once Van Doren arrives on \\"Twenty One,\\" ratings climb and Van Doren becomes a hero to millions of fans across the nation (not to mention the infatuation of thousands of young girls).  <br /> <br />When the outraged Stempel goes to court and declares that the \\"Twenty One\\" was fixed, Richard Goodwin, a young lawyer from Washington, is intrigued by the case and decides to probe further.  Thus, a national scandal is born. <br /> <br />The development of the characters in \\"Quiz Show\\" are compelling, particularly that of Charles Van Doren.  First, Fiennes portrays Van Doren as an honorable man with values - he initially questions the ethics of being given answers to questions.  Then, Van Doren is cast as a man who knew that he was breaking rules but was enjoying himself too much to care.  Finally, the audience begins to feel Van Doren's pain when he finally confesses to the world of his wrongdoings. <br /> <br />Van Doren's anguish can be felt in a scene with his father, Mark Van Doren, a distinguished poet played by Paul Scofield.  In this scene, Charles questions his morals and desperately needs guidance, but cannot bring himself to disappoint his father by telling him what he has done.  Fiennes is able to radiate these struggling emotions without saying a word. <br /> <br />Scofield also gave an amazing performance as Mark Van Doren. In a later scene when he hears of Charles's predicament, his sorrow can be seen in his face.  When Charles tries to assure his father that this will not damage his reputation, the elder Van Doren expresses his disappointment and pain all in one, sorrowful sentence:  \\"Your name is mine.\\" <br /> <br />Robert Redford did an amazing job on \\"Quiz Show\\".  His recreation of the 1950s was complete and believable.  The beginning scenes of people glued to their television sets helped to show how obsessed America was with television.  The jazz music by Mark Isham helped to further recreate the atmosphere of the time period. <br />One flaw in this movie, however, was that of Rob Morrow's portrayal of Richard Goodwin.  His faked Boston accent was annoying at best.  His character also was overdone, perhaps because the movie was based off a book by Richard Goodwin himself.  The movie should have focused on other characters, such as the NBC producers.  <br /> <br />The 1958 \\"Twenty One\\" case questioned the ethics of the television show business. Robert Redford created an unforgettable movie by presenting a painful yet compassionate perspective of the people involved in this scandal.  This can be seen in a noteworthy line from Charles Van Doren when he testified at court: <br />\\"I've stood on the shoulders of life and I've never gotten down into the dirt to build, to erect a foundation of my own. I've flown too high on borrowed wings...\\"
0767834739|5.0|I wish I could give this film more than five stars.  I waited for the release and was not disappointed.  Non-stop action.  I loved the fight scenes. Definetly one of the best action flicks released this year.  Can't wait to buy the DVD. The only problem is that we have to wait for the next RE Movie.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Let me start off by stating I am NOT an Ashton Kutcher fan.  I loved this movie and he was GREAT in it.  I didn't even want to watch it at first but I got talked into it, the next day I went out and bought a copy and watched it again.  It starts off at the end with him saying \\"if only I could go back I might be able to save her\\" then flashes back in time.  As a kid Evan (Ashton) has blackouts where he doesn't remember what happens but usually it's something bad.  He gets molested by Tommy & Kayley's dad (as does kayley) but blacks it out.  After going to a Psych Ward you find out his dad had the same blackout problems and many others (as did his grandfather).  The doctor tells his mom to monitor him by making Evan write everything in a journal and lets him see his dad (who lives in a mental hosital) but his dad tries to kill Evan and ends up getting killed.  It then flashes to age 13 Evan w/ his 3 friends Lenny (a fat kid), Kayley (not to sure on the spelling), and her brother Tommy (who is one sick f**k).  They get in some trouble w/ a stick of TNT (don't know what happens until much later) and Evan blacks it out and Lenny goes nuts and has to go to a Psych Ward as a patient.  Then they go to the movies and Tommy sees Evan kiss his sister and flips out only to later tie Evan's dog in a bag and light it on fire.  Evan's mom then says they're moving and it flashes to age 20 w/ Evan in college.  He goes out to drink w/ his roommate because he hasn't had a blackout in 7 yrs.  After taking a girl back to his place he reads one of his old journals and blacks out.  he then realizes he can read his old journals to go back in time to change the past, and he starts to do this.  This is where the movie gets real good and interesting (can he go back and save \\"her\\" (Kayley) or does he cause her to die, or is it Tommy, or is it Lenny, or is it a completely different Evan, or was it all in his mind since he inherited the disease of his dad and grandfather ????) but I won't go anyfurther you'll have to watch it to see for yourself (and hopefully you'll understand at the end but I didn't until about the 4th or 5th time I watched it), but it is a GREAT movie and you have to see it!!!!!
B0006284JQ|2.0|I remember the first time I ever heard Britney Spears.  The song was 'Baby One More Time' and I couldn't believe what I was hearing on the radio...crap (if you believe that this entire review will be negative, please read on).  But since radio was playing her songs a million times, I learned to like that song as well as many that she has released.  Her recent material is far better than her earlier, straight-from-the-studio manufactured pop hits, and I was not surprised by her timely release of a greatest hits CD.  Many people have attacked her for this, but I will not.  What I will say is that there are only 3 great songs on this album of 'greatest hits'.  Toxic is the best club song she ever produced, I'm a Slave 4 You is a close second, but when you hear 'Baby One More Time' again you understand why it was so popular.  This is Britney's crowning achievment because at the time, there was nothing out there that sounded the same. And it brazingly marked the beginning of the \\"Pop Starlets\\" era, as Elton John likes to call them.  As for \\"My Prerogative\\", we had hoped that Britney would sound less like a studio and more like herself as she got older.  This song is the worst song she ever released. It destroys the original and, quite frankly, is not very easy on the ears.  She sounds like a muzzled mule. If you are hoping to get the best of Britney, this would definitely be it, and it's worth a whole lot more than buying each album.  Maybe for the public's sake, just as her first song started the era, her greatest hits cd will end it.
B000001C6M|5.0|This is one of their best. While most debuts are just good and not great, this album was a huge kick in the balls to all the crazy headbangers out there. Melodic thrash! I love it. Anyhow, this is a killer album by a sick band. Album standout Crionics. Very Maiden-esque. One of the best.
0395389496|3.0|The illustrations are excellent as is the accompanying CD. My kids enjoyed both very much.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars?

B0006284JQ|5.0|I own every single Britney album ever released but that did not stop me from buying her Greatest Hits album, My Prerogative. This album absolutely completes any Britney collection. The highlight of the cd is definetly the unreleased track \\"Do Somethin'\\". On this track Britney sounds like a hardcore Gwen Stefani, it's got an awesome beat! \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" is another unreleased treat. Don't worry, the cd includes all the Britney classics from \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to \\"Everytime\\". The bonus cd is a collection of great Britney club remixes. The best track on the bonus cd has got to be the Chris Cox megamix. It combines many Britney classics (including \\"Slave\\", \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Toxic\\" and many others) into an brilliant mix. The \\"Outrageous\\" remix is even better than the original!  <br /> <br />If you are a Britney fan I highly recommend this cd, even if you all ready have all the songs. The packaging is really wicked and the disc booklet is full of great Britney pictures and a journalist's commentary. If you are not a Britney fan, maybe now is the time to give the girl a chance. Her greatest hits cd would be the perfect place to start!
B000641Z90|5.0|So, Finally it's here, the 5th official live video release from Phil's 6th worldtour as a solo artist (previous releases count the Passadena 1982 video, the Dallas 1985 video, the Berlin 1990 video/2DVD, and the Paris 1997 video/DVD). As such, one cannot quite keep from comparing this release to these former releases, when one wants to make an evaluation of the DVD. This being said, I shall emphasize that if your relatively new into Phil's music, or simply haven't bought the older releases for one reason or another, this is an excellent show, featuring a wide range of his greatest and best loved hits, and giving a very fine overview of how Phil is on stage. Furthermore, you'll have a large amount of extra features thrown in as an added value. <br /> <br />- THE TRACK LISTING - <br /> <br />Perhaps the greatest pro of this release is, that it features the FULL concert. A full 24 tracks are we treated with, which can only be described as generous. The only other complete release so far was the 1990 Serious Hits In Berlin (re-released in 2xDVD last year), and it is always a great frustration to the fans, when one of their favorite songs are cut away in the editing. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the set-list of this tour is quite well-balanced, featuring practically all the greatest, old as well as new - In The Air Tonight, Susudio, One More Night, Dance Into The Light, Another Day In Paradise, Can't Hurry Love, Can't Stop Loving You, and I could go on and on. Of course, a few tracks that I'd love to have seen here are missing - not one track from the Both Sides album - according to Phil his best, and I agree - is included, the title track would have fitted in perfectly; his most recent hit-single from the Brother Bear soundtrack, Look Through My Eyes, is omitted, this soundtrack being represented instead by the ballad No Way Out - which is in fact not a bad treat. I should have loved to have had the piano version of Do You Remember?, as performed on the '97 tour, but of course the line has to be drawn somewhere. <br /> <br />Instead, we are treated with several very pleasant surprises: An absolutely amazing gospel-version of True Colours, far superior to his '98 remake; a lovely version of Come With Me from his recent Testify album, again drawing on his amazing 5-piece of back-up vocalists; an impressive rendition of the gospel-like No Way Out, again using the full power of this vocal potential; and nearly last but not least, another track from the Testify album, It's Not Too Late, another of my favorites, and again presented in a wonderfull new version. <br /> <br />- THE PERFORMANCE - <br /> <br />The performance is, overall, great without being superb. Phil is in good vocal shape, but not as amazing as on the Live And Loose In Paris release from '97. The musicians play amazing, and overall this will probably rank second - after the 97 Paris concert, that was probably Phil's best ever - amongst his live releases. The arrangement is excellent, the upbeat songs are perfomed spotlessly, and the real power of the shw comes with the amazing vocal arrangement on several of the ballads, as mentioned above - True Colours, Come With Me, No Way Out and It's Not Too Late. <br /> <br />Generally, the on-scene performance is pretty dynamic and goes well along with the music - still, the scene doesn't quite give the same space for playing and entertainment as did the circular in-the-round stage used on the '97 tour. The lighting is ok, but I was not impressed - again, comparing with the amazing work on the '97 show, this was a minor let-down. <br /> <br />- SOUND AND FILMING - <br /> <br />The sound is virtually perfect, at least I can't find anything to complain on here. The sound of the music is much more pleasant than on the Berlin '90 show, which was perhaps the greatest weeknes of that show in my oppinion. The filming is excellent as well, the picture quality is great, and I don't miss the multi-camera angles option, which is even includedon a few tracks. <br /> <br />- EXTRA FEATURES - <br /> <br />All the videos for the featured songs are included - a generous treat for the fans. Ok, most of the videos are quite mediocre, but still, Phil could've released a seperate video-DVD and ripped the fans of another 20 . Of course, this is no guarantee that such a release will not come, as the videos of songs not played in the concert are not included. Of course, that should've been nice ... we're talking another 5 or 10 videos here I think. <br /> <br />Some old live-footage is included here, but frankly, this is nothing to go for. The Live Aid Against All Odds performance and the Secret Policeman's Ball In The Air Tonight performance are both in pretty lousy quality, mainly of interest for the serious fans. The 'wild card' features a 20-minutes performance with the Big Band, which never was my taste, so I can hardly appreciate this piece. Instead, there are loads of rare footage not included, that would've been obvious to include: The fantastic Policeman's Ball performance of The Roof Is Leaking, the very rare 1997 performance of The Same Moon with Laura Pausini (not sure whether this was a radio or TV show, this might not have been filmed), the 2002 TV performance of Wake Up Call, and I could go on. Perhaps one day, on future releases, these gems will se the light of day. <br /> <br />Still, these features, and also several documentaries, TV-specials and a gallery, are much more that what've been included on earlier releases, and with a full 224 minutes of extra material (yes, that's nealy 4 hours!), and a 133 minutes live-show, this can only be described as an extremely generous release, and defenitely woth bying, die-hard fan or newcommer. <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 9/10
B0000541AM|4.0|I first heard about this movie on I love the 70's. I wanted to see it so badley mainly because out where I live, there was a local band that I loved so much who were called Warriors. I was really influenced by them to see it. The bad thing at the time was I coudn't find it for rent anywhere. So finally on 4-16-04 I took the chance and bought it assuming I was gonna like it and I was right. It wasn't what I was quite expecting but it still rocked. After seeing it I thought that that band I love named themselves after the movie. Sad to say they did not but it's all good. I'm really looking forward for the Warriors video game for PS2 to be out soon and to see the remake of the Warriors set to be released sometime in 2006 (directed by Tony Scott). I'm not much of a reader but I really want to get the Warriors novel (by Sol Yurick). To all those teens and young adults, you wanna see a classic gang flick, see the Warriors and be watching for the video game for PS2 to be out soon along with the remake of the film set to be out in 2006.
B00064MW6U|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters twice. I loved it! Halle made the perfect catwoman for this role. She studied martial arts, took a lot of physical training, and all to do her own stunts in the movie. The story was original, the cinematography was great. All in all, don't listen to the critics you guys. Judge it for yourself. You just might be surprised! <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|I have been a horro movie fan for over 20 years.  I have seen all types of horror movies and have always been totally \\"in love\\" with any movie meant to scare a person.  I always find something to appreciate in a horror movie. <br /> <br />That being said, I would like to state that this is BY FAR, the BEST horror movie ever made.  I'm a little different than most \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" fans.  I just saw the movie this year(2004) for the first time and actually saw the re-make(also excellent, but in a different sense) first.  In fact, I liked the re-make so much, that I went out and bought the original immediatly. <br /> <br />This movie is great for so many reasons, I can hardly even begin.   <br />First, this movie contains some of the finest acting you will EVER see in a horror movie.  All of our characters are played by \\"no-name\\" actors, but they are far from bad and actually really good at making the viewer feel what the characters themselves are actually feeling.   <br /> <br />Second, the plot is absolutly fantastic.  \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" was great.  I've seen it a million and a half times, since I was about five.  The movie contains a basic plot and it would have been very easy for Romero simply to continue that story, but with a different set of characters.  Oh no, not Romero.  He does give us a new set of characters(mainly because the originals die in \\"Night\\") and he does pick up the story close to when \\"Night\\" ends, BUT now we have some pretty comlpex side-plots going on.  We have a pregnant women; a black man, who is not wanted with the group at first and who also just killed another cop for barging into a project and shooting innocent people.  We have a \\"hot-shot\\" who feels he is \\"untouchable\\".  Basically, we have the world shortly after the zombie attacks have taken place.  We have people on TV, trying to explain why this is happening, when the funny thing is, who would be watching TV at a time like that????? But that is the effect that Romero is getting at.  He touches on issues similiar throughout the movie.   <br />The gore in this movie is fantastic for the time it was shot.  Nowadays, it would be considered \\"cheesy\\" and I actually read another person's review here at amazon, stating that he found it cheesy.  GET A CLUE.  That same person also recommends watching \\"The Exorcist\\" or \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" because this was not scary enough.  GIVE ME A BREAK, what in the world is scarier that the possiblilty of being secluded with 3 strangers in a world that has been taken over by zombies??? <br />I love a \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\", but please don't compare this movie to that. <br /> <br />Seriously, and not to sound too cliche, the worst part about this movie is that it ends.  I wish it were like 7 hours longs, because it is so much fun to watch.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, I know this review is probably very rambled and out-of-order, but when it comes to this movie, I am just get way too excited and can't stop talking.  There are so many more things I would like to say about this movie, but just can't think of.  All in all, if you are going to see or buy only 1 horror movie, buy this one!
B00030590I|2.0|While Hero does deliver on the visual front, the story falls well flat. My first reaction upon it ending was to think we had been in our seats for at least three hours, I was shocked to see it was well short of that time...that should indicate the quality of the story telling. What could have been accomplished in a much more streamlined fashion is painfully dragged out. While the camera work is impressive, its nothing more than eye candy, because there is little to no substance behind it.
0792839749|5.0|I love this movie! It is great!. the colors are very vivid and has great music! good sound!
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|When I listen to Celine's past music, tears still well up in my eyes and I get a lump in my throat from the deep feeling she puts into every song.  She has touched me more than any other artist ever.  And for that reason, I bought the album without hestitation.  If I could, I would return it. <br />That being said, let's get to the meat: Even in the context of babies and new motherhood, this album is, at best, just okay, and no where near excellent - as we have come to expect from Celine.  She seems to have lost those vocal nuances that have made her the greatest singer ever.   <br />I cannot tell you how badly she does What a Wonderul World - you have to hear it.  Satchmo had far more feeling.  And her solo rendition of My Prayer is incredibly poor - the feeling is gone.   <br />I own nearly every album Celine has done.  Even her worst French album is 10 times better than this album. Unless you're a new mother totally wrapped up in your child, (and why not? After all it is the prettiest baby that ever was, right?!)  you will not like what you hear and you will wonder what has happened to the greatest voice ever heard.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It's true that there is material missing from the \\"complete\\" show.  (...)It explains how Live Aid was to be a one-time unrecorded experience and what was done to \\"recreate\\" the show from archived material.  Also why Led Zeppelin will not allow its performance to be included but they are donating proceeds from their upcoming DVD to the charity.  This was a charity event that continues to be a charity.  20 years later and you can still contribute.  If a pledge drive starts during Disk 3, I'm skipping ahead to Disk 4.
B00003CXE7|2.0|With Ridley Scott's name attached to a gladiator movie, I expected something good. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I hated the dog jumping through fire. I hated the musical score blatantly ripping off Gustav Holst' \\"The Planets\\". I hated the little boy who looked like pre-adolescent Adrian Lyne. I hated totally the UNCONVINCING cgi effects. I hated that the tigers didn't EAT any of the stadium combatants. I hated the completely miscast Joaquin Phoenix. I hate that the trailer featuring Kid Rock's \\"Bawitdaba\\" wasn't included on this dvd.
1401200605|5.0|I've always been a great fan of Jeph Loeb, ever since I first picked up his celebrated \\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\". His writing style brings out the art, in my opinion, as the venerable Jim Lee's art also brings out his partner's words. It is not, however, in these two's gifts that make \\"Batman: Hush\\" so special. It is the fact that unlike some other books, \\"Hush\\" appeals to its audience in that it is not only a collaboration of the industry's greatest talents, but also a collaboration of Batman's whole life. Poison Ivy's talents return, Superman's back with a vengeance, and miss Catwoman's romance with Batman is rekindled. Truly, I could not ask for more in such a collaboration - and neither could you.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|God this brings back memories...Live Aid was rather like Woodstock for the less-self-indulgent Generation X.  I've often wondered when this would be out on DVD and will pick it up for the late, great Freddie Mercury's performance of \\"Radio Ga-Ga\\" alone.  A must-have for any child of the 80's.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is a true masterpiece! Our whole family likes this even the 2 year olds like it. <br />It has something for everyone! I bought 2 copies! Good for a gift also. <br />I highly recomend it.
0385508417|5.0|I found this book last week at a Good Will for 50 cents. I figured I'd pick it up. Then I discoved this was the book that the movie was being made about. So I decided to read it. Well, it was so funny! And very short and easy to read. I'm a big fan of small chapters.<br /><br />I had to let some friends borrow it already. We can't wait to see the movie now!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Among other things, like being funny and incredibly animated, it deals with the fears every little child has: nightmares, monsters, and at the end I suppose that children feel relieved of them. No doubt that is a great movie for kids and parents.
B0002I831S|4.0|The only Star Trek I ever liked was the original series. Never watched any of the later incarnations / spinoffs. When these eps first arrived, I knew it was a bust - what, 40-45 DISCS?!?! You had to figure the season set approach would eventually come, and it has. The picture quality looks terrific. What really would have put this over the top would have been to feature the various cast members on commentary tracks (surely they have nothing else better to do), but there are none. Cool packaging, too.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I previewed some of the other reviews for this CD. MC5? You've messed up your priorities son.  <br />Nickelback, first of all, is for all of you people who like rock, or hard rock. This CD, their newest to date, is a continuance of their Silver Side up album, it has many similarities.  <br />I would rate this whole album, I'd say, about a four point five. Needs improvements, but overall, a great CD.  <br />By the way, if you don't like this CD, why go on this CD's section to write about it? Wouldn't that be a waste of your insignificant time? Oh by the way, you, you with the band name, CRUDDYPATHETICEXCUSEFORBLANDMUSIC....it sucks. Terribly sorry. Spend more time on that. Maybe you'll think of something....like listening to a good band for once.  <br />
B0000AI44Q|1.0|I suffered through the entire dvd presentation and I came away saying, HUH! The story is ridiculous. No more concept albums Neil. Please.
B000084T18|4.0|Although 50 cent's breakthrough album is not a revolution in terms of lyrics or anything else, it is one of the most entertaining albums I've heard.   <br />\\"Patiently Waiting\\" is 50 & Shady at the top of their games <br />\\"In da club\\" everyone has heard a million times, but it's still a good song <br />\\"Many Men\\", \\"Back Down\\", and \\"Don't Push Me\\" are also highlights.  \\"Wanksta\\" is a bonus track on my CD and that's my favorite song.   <br /> <br />You might not like 50 cent, but he changed the way gangsta rap is viewed in the mainstream, sold millions of records as well as set up the careers of his G-Unit comrades, not to mention he single-handedly destroyed the career of Ja Rule.  50 cent definitely changed the Rap Game.
0596007124|5.0|At first I didn't understand how they would apply the Head First formula to design patterns. I'd read two head first before this one and I was impressed with those so I took a look and now, not only is it clear how they approached the topic, it's also clear to me that this is the best way to learn design patterns. <br /> <br />The Gang of Four book laid out the basics. Here is the pattern, here are some examples. The head first book goes a lot further. They show you good and bad examples of the pattern. They give solid reasoning behind the pattern. It's great.  <br /> <br />There are times when I would look at a piece of code and have the author explain to me that it was based on one of the GoF patterns. I would come away thinking, if that's the pattern, then that pattern sucks. It's clear that patterns can be misapplied. So understanding the the how design patterns are applied, and how they are commonly applied wrongly, or to an extreme, is just as important as understanding the basic mechanics of the pattern itself. <br /> <br />The example code is in Java, but I think this is an ideal book for anyone passionate about patterns.
B00005JKES|2.0|I've seen this and the extra features are pretty good, but to NOT HAVE THE PILOT EPISODE? Why on earth would ANYONE buy this without THE episode?? The one that started everything! I understand at the time it was tied up legally, but to put this out without it makes NO SENSE AT ALL. I will not buy this until this HUGE error is corrected. If they DO re-release the set with the pilot, they need to include both versions. The one as it played on U.S. television, and the one that was edited as a stand-alone film for European release. And WHAT is taking so long for season two???
B00003CWL6|2.0|My original review must be erased because it was overly pious and advocated outright rejection of the perverted hoodlums of Hollywood.  I have little love for most of the noxious pukes in the entertainment industry -- and I consider this film to be a bunch of pretentious crapola -- but freedom means that people can watch this sewage if they so choose.  The fact that such a film can be haled by so many is further demonstration that the herd mentality has almost completely taken us over.
B00005JMJG|5.0|In an age when it seems that all the love stories have been told and retold many times over, here is a film that manages to make film romance seem new again.  Jim Carrey turns in his most human and honest performance to date and although his pairing with co-star Kate Winslet may initially seem slightly odd to those who haven't seen the film, all reservations are gone when they are on screen together.  This film is romantic without being sappy, thought provoking without being pretentious and boasts an element of originality that is all to scarce in the world of cookie-cutter Hollywood \\"product\\".  Watching this film would be time well spent and thoroughly enjoyed.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is by far my favorite CD of all time.  It's two discs and every song is amazing.  It has a replay-ability that is very uncommon.  CD's like this are not made in the year 2004, plain and simple.
B00005JNEI|1.0|With the pressing of \\"Play,\\" one becomes immediately aware that there is something drastically wrong with this documentary. No other one I've encountered included a disclaimer announcing that \\"the following interviews and commentary are for entertainment only.\\" Such a warning is anathema to the goal of a documentary, which should be to educate. As far as entertainment value goes, however, you'd have to be a member of the tinfoil hat left (or those who think John Ashcroft's men interrogate librarians every other Monday) to get any meaningful information out of this film.<br /><br />What is most surprising is that, even from a technical standpoint, Moore's skills are overrated. The film drags on and on. It is devoid of drama as Moore cannot be bothered to showcase any conflicting points of view. Had he merely interviewed a couple of people who were not partisan Democrats he might have succeeded in making the film digestible, but he's simply not interested. If the plot were outlined in equation form, it would read: 2000 Election=Republican Plot, Iraq=Vietnam, Bush=Oppressor, Emotion=Fact, and Individual Suffering=Needed Alteration of Foreign Policy.<br /><br />By the end of the film one feels used and cheated. You may feel anger and indignation, but it's solely due to charlatans like Moore earning fortunes from the cobbling together of mendacious inuendos. It is rather depressing to watch such a cultural blockbuster and, with little concentration, think up five hundred responses which devastate Moore's positions. It's quite easy to do with Fahrenheit 9/11 as it relies chiefly on emotion. The director's emotophilia is even more pronounced in this film than it was in Bowling for Columbine. In the end we have only feeling. He spends over thirty minutes with a woman from Flint who tragically lost a son in Iraq. One feels sympathy for her until she abandons any sense of perspective by deciding that the result of her son's death will be for her to vent all of her rage and anguish in the direction of The White House and President George W. Bush. Moore couldn't be happier about her conclusion and hopes that you'll do the same.<br /><br />Before I saw the movie, allegations by commentators that the film violated McCain-Feingold struck me as unfair, but the evidence is in the reels. We hear from an injured soldier who states (I'm not kidding) that once he gets home the first thing he is going to do is become very active in his local Democratic Party. Go leftist young man! We also see the dour and self-righteous filmmaker on Capitol Hill attempting to convince Congressmen that they should sign their kids up for Iraq. This is yet another of his many \\"emotional over all\\" segments, but one begins to wonder here about Moore's intelligence. Does he really think that parents can enlist their sons without their consent? Does he even know that children are not allowed in the military? I heard him repeat this same line of anti-reasoning during an interview with Bill O'Reilly over the summer. His confusion here may be based on a utopian's ignorance about the mechanics of the real world.<br /><br />In retrospect, a more accurate title for this film would have been, The Eternal Bush, as its spirit and one-sidedness is remarkably similar to Goebbels' The Eternal Jew. All that is needed is a few shots of Republican legislators scampering into state houses like rats to complete the portrait. Obviously, it's quite fashionable to compare individuals to members of The Third Reich and I am loath to add my pen to the cultural totality of misapplied historical allusions, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is nothing more than an ideologue's checklist of propaganda.<br /><br />With Moore, most of his arguments refute themselves. One cannot believe that the Patriot Act is turning us into a police state when the very existence and celebration of Fahrenheit 9/11 disproves it. This is the freest country in the world and nothing better exemplifies our liberty than somebody like Michael Moore making millions from the dissemination of his anti-American propaganda. Perhaps he might consider naming his next film, \\"Bush Made Me.\\"Michael Moore making millions from the dissemination of his anti-American propaganda. Perhaps he might consider naming his next film, \\"Bush Made Me.\\" <br />
B00005OWEG|1.0|This is one of the most tragic releases in the history of dvd. What's good? It was given a lush, Technicolor transfer, which looks terrific. The sound is awesome, yes. It is an epic film, no denying any of that. BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM. For WHATEVER reason, Coppola and his cinematographer decided to BUTCHER the original 2.35:1 Technovision / anamorphic framing down to a GHASTLY 1.95:1!!! If you want a clear example of what I'm talking about, watch the accompanying trailer. IT is framed at the correct 2.35:1. WATCH IT and compare it to the feature presentation and you will discover horrible examples of quasi-pan+scanning. How on earth could Coppola continue to sanction the visual mutilation? Early on, he might be forgiven for thinking that some compromise might be worth it given the dimensions of film and television screens, but times have changed and widescreen is the NORM when it comes to home video presentation. People have become more SOPHISTICATED and UNDERSTAND and ACCEPT those \\"annoying black bars\\". Someone over at Paramount and Zoetrope need to SLAP Francis UPSIDE HIS WINE-SWILLING HEAD and make him release this AGAIN in its ORIGINAL 2.35:1 FORMAT!!!!! (Record a commentary while you're at it).
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Generally I really like the film scripts that Richard Curtis has written.  This one is no exception, but in this film, his directorial debut (I think), he ups the \\"sappy\\" quotient a few notches too high.<br /><br />A few examples:  the musicians rising up from the pews after the wedding ceremony to add musical accompaniment to the Beatles song, Liam Neeson's kid learning the drums practically overnight to win the affections of the most popular girl in school (whose singing in the film looks more like another pop-music video than anything else), and several other hokey sentimental moments that add too much saccharine to the proceedings.  On paper those moments are okay, but the way they are shot cinematically cheapens the film.<br /><br />Good moments abound too, however:  Emma Thompson's Christmas Eve realization that her husband Alan Rickman is unfaithful leads to an acting moment that ranks with Thompson's best work, and the sweetly romantic scene where Colin Firth clumsily proposes in another language to Lucia Moniz.<br /><br />There are too many good things about this movie to write it off as a sappy piece of fluff, but there are too many sappy moments in this film that compromise the \\"structural integrity\\" of the script.<br /><br />DVD bonus features are what we've come to expect nowadays:  Commentary and another little feature or two.<br /><br />Worth watching?  Oh yes.  Worth buying to watch over and over?  Depends if you're diabetic and have a tolerance for sugary sappiness.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|The best show is now coming to DVD... its about time MacGyve the best tv show is coming to DVD.....
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania is one of the greatest artists of the modern day, she's the mastermind behind the biggest-selling album of all time by a female artist, the highest selling country album of all-time, tied with AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\" for the sixth highest selling album ever, and she's the only artist to have three consecutive diamond albums.  <br /> <br />With all that aside, she's still one of the greatest songwriters and performers ever. Her live show can not be beat and her songs are always catchy and relevant to one's life.  <br /> <br />This album contains all of her biggest hits from \\"The Woman In Me\\", \\"Come On Over\\", and \\"Up!\\", plus it has three new songs on it.  <br /> <br />The album goes in reverse chronological order (I'm sure there's an actual term for that), starting with the song \\"Forever and For Always\\" which is a very meaningful and beautiful song about love lasting forever. It goes straight into \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\" which was her comeback single in 2002, and she surely got us ALL good with that song. \\"Up!\\" is next and it's just a fun, tongue-in-cheek kind of song. Very Shaniaesque.  <br /> <br />Following the \\"Up!\\" songs are the ones from \\"Come On Over\\", including \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\", and \\"From This Moment On\\" -- all of which were huge hits in the states and Internationally. \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman\\", \\"Honey, I'm Home\\" and \\"Don't Be Stupid! (You Know I Love You)\\", which are three of her best songs to perform live are also included. It also includes \\"Love Gets Me Every Time\\" and \\"Come On Over\\"... now, you have to understand that \\"Come On Over\\" is my favorite CD of all time, so I could go on and on about it.  <br /> <br />After we go through her biggest selling album, we find some of the true gems. The songs that weren't completely overpolished and sound really homey. \\"No One Needs To Know\\" has a kind of stripped down acoustic feel to it. A nice change of pace from the previous tracks on here. After that we run into \\"You Win My Love\\" which was a HUGE hit for Shania, and is probably the most rock-influenced song on \\"The Woman In Me\\", which should come as no surprise since it was written by her husband/producer Mutt Lange.  <br /> <br />Then you hit \\"I'm Outta Here!\\" which is another great live song from Shania. With a fun beat and awesome lyrics, it's no wonder this was such a big hit for her with fans. After that you come into \\"The Woman In Me\\" which is one of Shania's slowest, but most beautiful songs. This is such an emotional song and Shania sings it magnificently.  <br /> <br />After that you hit two of Shania's biggest-known songs with fans,  \\"Any Man Of Mine\\" and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\" - I know some people who aren't Shania fans, but they like at least one of those two songs. And who can't? They're awesome country tunes with a bit of rock that really pulls the entire Shaniaesque attitude together. <br /> <br />Now we've got the three (technically four) new songs from Shania... my personal favorite of these is \\"Don't!\\" which is such an emotional ballad about a relationship that needs some mending. It could possibly be one of Shania's best songs ever.  <br /> <br />\\"Party for Two\\" is the newest single from Shania, and it comes in a pop and country version to better suit her fans. The pop version is with Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath, he has a unique vocal styling, but I'm not too sure that it completely fits with the song. The awesome beat makes up for it though. On the country version, Shania teams up with Billy Currington, a country newcomer with a southern sexy voice fit PERFECTLY for the track. It's too bad the song is somewhat poorly written. Fun song, but it's also weak. <br /> <br />Closing off the entire album is \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" which is one of the most unique and different songs Shania has ever put out. It has a country-swing beat that puts you in the feel of an old western club almost. An awesomely written song about a guy not quitting his bad habits \\"He drinks, he smokes, he cuts, he swears, and he tells bad jokes...\\", but the girl in the song is stubborn and isn't giving up on him either. Very well done. <br /> <br />This is a must-have for any music fan, period. No matter what your tastes are, you'll love this 21 track mega-disc that's destined to put a smile on your face.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I think those who dont like this are just plain [...] and I dont care who that offends. You people [...] about these albums under a microscope- I would imagine those who give this album 2 stars don't really write good music. Try writing and arranging, a long winded piece just like a classical composer would. You would slowly stop the bitching and nitpicking and realize that these themes are much more structured and arranged than you would like to believe. Even members in the band annoy me- anderson saying if they had Cd's he would use 2/3 of it now. Screw that. Keep the whole damn thing you tard. Probably the best thing you've been a part of.  Whats 80 minutes in your boring life? This CD is highly emotional, the trick is to memorize the entire album note for note in your head. Once you know where the songs are going you will reap the benifits that im sure these 2 star guys dont even get. Is there something wrong with the melodies? I dont understand. Amazing production, synths, best sounding trons ive ever heard taped. Cool stereo guitar and in general a massive amount of analog effects and goodies. Best track here is the Remembering. The last one is okay too, but certainly lacks the same amount of beauty and lushness that remembering gives off.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold mountain is a haunting film carefully made . It goes far beyond a simple love story . It talks about the false ideals , the absurdity and no sense of a bloody episode in the Civil War . The love is not a goal in itself but the bliss which inspires to both lovers make to find a certain sense to their lives immersed in the middle of the madness .<br />The presence of Ruby (Rene Zelwegger) in the film works out as betterment device to the script . She was terrific with this acting , and the secondary characters are magnificent built.<br />Besides if you add the amazing and powerful presence of one of the most talented and beautiful actress in the Cinema : Nicole Kidman and this raising talent and mercurial actor : Jude Law you will find at the end of the sum more than a reason to include this film among your favorites list .<br />Excellent photography and artistic direction .<br />A winner and consider from its initial release a neo classic film.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I cant get enough of Seinfeld. I enjoy the earlier episodes (seasons 1-3) the best for some reason. The show is in syndication all over yet, I cant wait to get the series on DVD. One of my favorite episodes is \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" along with \\"The Parking Garage\\". I truly think the show was at it's best in the first 3-4 years, but I still enjoy all episodes. <br />
B0002KVULG|4.0|DRACULA (1979) was a great re-working of the classic Bela Lugosi version of DRACULA (based on the stageplay by Hamilton and Deane).  Much of the story is flipped around from Stoker's novel, and the filmmakers seem to play fast and loose with the myths and abilities of everyone's favorite bloodsucker.  It has moments that lose some logic (why is Mina reflected in a pool of water? what about the \\"kite scene\\"?), but overall it captures some really great performances and a wonderful movie.  Frank Langella will always be my image of DRACULA - a haunted romantic tragic figure who is a seducer of the highest order.  He turns in a star performance that is incredible.  Kate Nelligan's Lucy is played impressively strong and erotic.  Olivier is touching as Van Helsing (even if he was old enough to have to rely on doubles for action scenes).  And Donald Pleasance literally chews on Seward (he eats constantly throughout) and turns in another fine performance.<br /><br />This DVD release is problematic for the choice of John Badham (the director also of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER)to suck out most of the color.  Seems a little strange and compromises some of the film's cinematography.  But they do include a 40 minute feature with all the major players and Badham's commentary is entertaining and great.  John William's score sounds awesome digitally rendered, and it's one of his little known gems that is haunting and epic.  I love this version, and even with some strange moments and gaffes (what's up with the red lasers and James Bond opening love scene?) it still works.  Probably thanks to a first class cast and the bold choices of Frank Langella - a great Dracula who deserves praise for his choice to diversify from the Lugosi legend.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I've always been a fan of Britney Spears. She has really made a statement for herself. She does what she wants and doesn't care what anyone says about her. To me that's a good role model, even though people say she isn't because of the way she dresses and acts. Who cares! It's her life and she'll do what she wants. I'm glad she came out with a new cd, even though it's all her songs put together in one cd. I do wish she did put all her hit songs on here like \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\".<br /><br />However, I still think this is a great cd and I'm sure she put it together since she's decided to settle down for awhile and take time off from her music career to enjoy being married and not having to work nonstop. I give her major credit for everything she has done, she's really proven herself to the whole world that she is a great artist with great songs, awesome videos, and a really nice voice. I really think people who like some songs of hers or are too cheap to buy all her cds should pick up this album, it's really awesome and you get a great selection of songs.
B000002GVO|1.0|I remember hearing the first three songs from Hotel California hundreds of times each on the radio when the album came out. Overhearing a decent song is a great way to ruin it for me. Overhearing a mediocre song--any single from this album--is a great way to make me nauseous. And that it did. I learned to detest the Eagles and every bit of schlock they put out.<br /><br />Almost thirty years later, my tastes have broadened and softened. I listen to just about anything now (but I still listen to hard/challenging stuff); I also recognize the genius in some of the stuff that annoyed me thirty years ago. Even the goofy band Sweet is something I now enjoy. I give just about everything a chance, or even a second chance, and find that I enjoy music so much that very little of it disappoints me.<br /><br />I got this CD for free and figured I'd give it a full, attentive listen, having never owned the original. The recognizable tracks--the overplayed singles from so long ago--went in one ear and out the other. I've heard them so much they don't even register. Background noise. The remainder of the tracks are weak and uninteresting, save perhaps the last track. I gave them all my 3-strikes-or-out chance; none of them are worth ever listening to again, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />\\"Hotel California\\" is absolutely overrated garbage. In 1976, as a hardcore 12-year-old music fan, I recognized the Eagles as the epitome of everything that was wrong with music. That opinion will never soften.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I listen to it over and over again whenever I get the opportunity-even at school! These songs are what get me through the day. My favorites are &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; and &quot;Lying from You&quot;. Besides the great songs, the CD also has cool extras that you can get by putting it into your computer.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This disc rocks hard and is my favorite out of the 4.  I can't believe all the bad reviews from people.  Calling them ripoffs of Alice In Chains, BLAH!  Every song and disc sounding the same, BLAH!  For starters get over it, AIC is no longer anymore, yes they were good but, GET OVER IT! As for sounding the same, geez let's all hope they release a Hip Hop cd next time so they have some diversity LMFGDAO.  Look at the group Tool, how many bands out there sound like those guys? God, I can think of atleast 3 of them off hand.  Anyways this disc delivers great heavy rock with great vocals, from the hard-rocking starter \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" to the more mellow closer \\"Serenity.\\" There really isn't a bad song on this disc.  I'd highly recommend this Godsmack or any of their releases to anyone who loves hard rocking tunes like I do.  Don't listen to all the bad reviews on here, pick it up and see what you think of it yourself.  Opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one.   <br />My fav. tracks= Straight Out Of Line, Faceless, Re-Align, Serenity
B000667GFK|5.0|I have listened to this album for days in a row being a fan of Luis Miguel's incredible talent as well as loving Mariachi Music as I grew up with several \\"Mariachis\\" on my family. <br /> <br />Mexico En La Piel, is that; it touches you in a way that it has not been done since the  \\"Romances\\" series of Boleros. This is another attempt to mantain our music and culture alive, by one of the most talented singers of our time.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs are: Cruz de Olvido, Motivos, Un Mundo Raro and Mexico en la piel.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This has all the hits. Great cd. I bought this cd yesterday and its fabulous! Only one song Im not sure why they didnt include was \\"You Got A Way\\", proably will turn up later on a import I bet. But otherwise its very good. Some of the songs are remixes. \\"Your Still The One\\" doesnt have the spoken intro. \\"The Woman In Me\\" is the single edit. Nothing wrong with that though. Just thought some might like to know before buying. Since I dont have these versions, I think that its great!! Good job Shania. The 3 extra songs too are good too.
B00066VUPM|5.0|OK, if you get past that Travis never topped Radiohead (as they were predicted to at one point in 2000/2001) and recently were usurped by the new darlings of \\"sensitive rock\\", Coldplay, they are still quite an enjoyable band and well, well worth the time and effort.  SINGLES includes just that - all 17 of their UK singles since 1997, some of which have become some of our most important modern songs.  Included here are \\"Coming Around\\", a single-only release from 2000 and the new \\"Walking In The Sun\\".  \\"The Distance\\", the 18th track, and the only non-single track here, is written by Dougie Payne, Travis' bassist, while the rest of the lot comes from lead singer Fran Healy's pen.  This is a GREAT intro to the band and a fine addition to anyone's collection, provided they like quality music with some sensitivity and passion.
B000002JOH|5.0|My first introduction to the world of Pantera.  This cd has brutal, adrenaline-fueled, kick in the mouth tunes on it.  From Philip's nothing less than brutal vocals, Dimebag Darrel's hypnotizing shred he does on guitar, Rex's awesome bass lines, to Vinnie's hard hitting drum beats.  This disc sure packs a hard punch.  Personally my favorite of the discs but, can't overlook \\"Cowboys From Hell,\\" \\"Far Beyond Driven,\\" and \\"Great Southern Trendkill\\" either.  \\"Reinventing The Steel\\" I thought was were Pantera started to lose their edge.  Some may disagree and like that disc, I personally didn't like it at all.  Anyways if you like brutal vocals, great shredding guitar lines, and hard pounding drums, this disc is totally for you.   <br />My fav. tracks= Mouth For War, Walk, Rise, Regular People (Conceit), Hollow
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I can hardly find words to describe this brilliant album. I haven't been impressed so much by a new band (and debut LP) for a long long time. From the first track \\"Neighborhood #1 (tunnels)\\" to the last track \\"In The Back Seat\\", this record doesn't slow down or let you down in any way. Amazing! <br /> <br />Their self titled EP from 2003 is also worth the buy.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended for any indie/alterna rock fans or rock music lovers in general for that matter.  <br /> <br />Groundbreaking and truely beautiful....
0201633612|3.0|This is defenetly the famous book on Design Patterns.   It'll be great, If the authors come up with  2nd edition. Following are the areas which can be improved upon:  1) simple and impressing examples  2) sample code in JAVA instead of C++
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd iz great because all the cds they make is good. Their songs put you into a mood where if there was something that you were going to do you wouldn't do it again.
B000063DHL|5.0|First off i like to say Iron Maiden is the best band ever and Bruce Dickinson is the best singer ever. This album is the eighth iron maiden album i bought and its is awesome if you dont have it go out and buy it now. The first song \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" is a masterpiece the second \\"Wasted Years\\" pure genis the rest of the songs are brilliant, inspirational, masterpieces i love this album.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The greatest hits CD is a complete review of Shania's very best music as trhe title implies but it also has three new songs that are bound to be great hits as well. The talent of Shania in cd music form and dvd video form makes her music complete for the listener. You need to own this album and the Up close and personel dvd and the platinum dvd to really see and feel her music. Do not pass up this chance or you will miss out on the very best of one the greatest singers of all time. Speed
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I love symphonic metal, and I do believe that Nightwish are the best I have ever heard.  Not only is each band member extreamly talented, but they have a style all their own.  They are forever trying new apporaches to their music, and they have an almost cult-like following; they are a far cry from the usual under-class drug/gun slinging manufactered artists we hear too much of today.  This albumn is amazing, however I will not say that it is better than their others, as I love every Nightwish albumn that I have.  The music can be read into, with deeper meanings taken from the almost biblical-like lyrics, and each song tells a story, but the music itself is always amazing.  I hardly have time for other artists.  I wish that I could give this albumn more than five stars.
0395389496|5.0|Though this book is not \\"old\\" by publishing standards, it has already become a classic, must-read Christmas tale for people of all ages to cherish.  It deals with the \\"Santa question\\" in a sensitive way that transcends the \\"does he or does he not exist\\" issue with a much bigger truth: the spirit of Christmas is real and will always endure in the hearts of those who believe.  In a few pages, the author creates an incredibly rich and poignant world that leaves quite an impression long after the book is closed.  If you haven't read it, I don't want to spoil any of it by revealing too much of the plot in my review.  But let me say, as fine and wonderful as the movie is, there is still nothing that compares with curling up by the fire with a child and reading them this story straight from the book...enjoying their wonderment and appreciating the beautiful and evocative artwork.
B00013F35I|2.0|An ok set-list - not bad video - but boy, the sound on this thing is horrendous - you can't hear bruce's vocals for anything.  and the performance is not a great one - stick with LIVE IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN unless you HAVE to have a RISING TOUR dvd - but the sound is as worse as when they aired this on CBS and you couldn't hear him - terrible, terrible, mix - and i suspect from what i did hear - that his voice was not great that nite either.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I also have all the Marillion albums since day 1. This one is a really good one. If you are expecting an album with 3 minutes songs for the radio this is not it. But if you are into Marillion and like the way they have to make you travel through music you will love this one. Enjoy!
0767827902|5.0|Bogdanovich's 'Last Picture Show' is a nostalgic but achingly melancholy film about change and loss.  Set in small town Texas in the 50's it charts the lives and loves of a group of young friends as they face the harsh realities of the world.   Superbly acted and directed with a sensitivity and restraint that makes you wonder what happened to Bogdanovich (who really only made two great films; this and 'Targets') this sums up all that made 70's American cinema great
0596007124|5.0|I really enjoyed and benefited from reading Head First Design Patterns. The authors not only are entertaining (an approach not taken often enough by technical authors) but approach the topic of design patterns in an effective building block fashion. Each chapter builds on the next. I have learned not only the \\"hows\\" of design patterns but the \\"whys\\" and \\"whens\\" of using each design pattern. Design pattern limits and trade-offs are made clear as you move through each chapter. The examples are real world and the exercises bring it all home for keeps. If you don't enjoy being entertained as you learn, this book is definitely not for you. For the rest of us having fun while gaining a deep understanding of Design Patterns is a treat.
B00028HBKM|2.0|but you can't take Hollywood out of Gibson <br /> <br />Surrounded by controversy it came as quite a surprise to find out just how ordinary this film really is.  Certainly the violence is distressing and there are a couple of beautifully acted and moving moments. In many ways I'd have liked to be able to say that this is a good film, but I can't  <br />So what is wrong with this film?  Well, Mel Gibson.  Although there is no doubting his sincerity in making this film it does demonstrate his limitations as an artist. His decision to have the film subtitled demonstrates his striving for authenticity; so, how to explain the 'Golden Turkey Awards'esque moment where Mary and he laugh about the table he has built or the addition of a few hissing demons to spice up the non violent moments?  He also wants us to know who is GOOD and who is BAD.  There is no room for moral ambiguity in this film; hence, Pilate, a victim of political machinations and Herod, a laughably sybaritic decadent who is obviously a BAD man. <br />By the end of the film I felt bludgeoned; not by the violence, but by the stereotypes that Gibson parades for our entertainment and by his desire to make sure that this is a Hollywood film despite all of its pretentions to being ART
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is an incredible performer and this CD just goes to prove my point. Shania has always been loyal to country music and she is absolutely amazing.
B00000K3UU|3.0|Meh....This movie was OKAY.  Nothing to go crazy about.  It did have Jon Stewart of the Daily Show, but that's the only thing to FUSS over.  Besides it being an \\"Insert Cute Little Boy\\" movie, I would say that it does okay.  Even though the humor relies heavily on this...and Rob Schneider plays ANOTHER annoying man.   <br />I'm tired of Rob Schneider. <br />I remember when it first came out, and everyone was relating everything to SCUBA STEVE! from the movie.  I saw the Scuba Steve........\\"joke\\"?.........and thought it was...okay....but not worth saying out loud a second time for people to hear.  This movie should be buried.  I like Mr. Deeds better.  You should see National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 instead of this anyway.  So what are you doing with this?  Go buy National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1.  It's much better.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I won't buy this DVD simply because it does not include Led Zeppelin's first live performance in 5 years - since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980 - and likely last ever as Led Zeppelin with Basist John Paul Jones.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Open-car-door-eared Eric Bana stars as the Hulk in this one, with a vague enough physique to fill the shoes of Dr. Bruce Banner.  Homeless man Nick Nolte co-stars as a less-cool scientist who is trying to acheive immortality through regeneration...only it makes him more haggard and unappealing... <br /> <br />SOOOO, the plot unfolds and I get less interested, then Bruce changes into the Hulk and crushes things with stuff.  At one point, he fights mutated dogs, who just come off as cartoony Cujos, and rips one completely in half with his powerful arms...Then more plot with Jennifer Connely's face in it, then back to the Hulk jumping into helecopters and putting more and more pressure on his indestructable pants.  For God's sake, he bought quality pants...he seemed to expect this. <br /> <br />Anyways, the Hulk does what's expected of him to tanks and things, and eventually beauty reaches the beast...The completely \\"Naired\\" beast...(No hair on the Hulk....what the hell.  I guess I just expect SOME body hair, not a body so hairless it looks like candle wax...) <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I was impressed by this.......\\"film\\"?.........It has great effects, and I like the direction style, for the most part.  But don't expect the guy who wrote this thing to be in the \\"Hollywood scene.\\"   <br /> <br />He won't be writing anything anymore, except maybe on the backs of Denny's placemats.
B00005V1Z5|2.0|This film had its moments, but when it was over both my girlfriend and I thought it stunk to high hell.  There are a few laughs, but Ben Stiller is more annoying than he's ever been, and the film is simply overkill.  The plot is also a tad confusing--certainly not profound though.  If you are in a silly mood, go ahead and watch it.  If you are not in the mood for b.s., caution: you may destroy your television.
B000089RVX|1.0|To tell you the truth, I do not understand the hype over this band. I haven't found a grain of talent in overused guitar lines, stereotypical \\"goth\\", and repetitive lyrics that make up Evanescence. Each song has the exact same message - suicide, self-mutilation, etc. - that portray Amy Lee as yet another angsty teenager. Of course, this will appeal to those who are \\"misunderstood\\", which is Amy's goal - to make money off kids' emotions. I find it disgusting that any artist would move away from Christian singing (I'm not a Christian but I still find it disgusting) to move into what's popular and get more money. <br /> <br />The music itself is boring. Let's not beat around the bush, it put me to sleep. I couldn't get through \\"My Immortal\\" without realizing that the album was going to say the same things over and over, and each song is one variation of another. The rhythms aren't catchy, so the songs blend together with ease. <br /> <br />The popularity of this album baffles me. Of course, Evanescence is well-liked among our pop culture these days, but pop culture is fickle. In a few years, no one will remember this band. Keep that in mind, kids, before you rush out to buy this album because all the cool kids at school have it.
B0000AK7AG|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out and I said I'm never gonna watch this crap. Then my family was like oh come on. You gotta watch this movie. They finally got me to watch it after I got bribed with Taco Bell and man, I was put to shame about what I said about this movie. It captured my heart from start to finish. Babe shows us that pigs can also get respect on the farm. He's adorable, lovable, funny, nice, and smart and finds his identidy as a \\"sheep pig.\\" At first he's being clowned about it but as the movie goes on, you see what happens. The other character that I like is Ferdinand. He is really funny. There are some sad parts like when Babe has his mother taken away from him and when Ma gets killed by the dog but every great movie needs adversity. I hate The Oscars but James Cromwell won best supporting actor for his role as Farmer Hoggett and that's one of my very few reasons why I like The Oscars. This is a movie for all ages with one of the best movie endings of all-time!
B00005JM02|5.0|Wonderful movie for both children and grownups alike. Many jokes will go over the heads of the kids but the adults will appreciate the subtleties. Especially when the behavior of the fish and birds is mimicked. Fish really do float back and forth in and out of anemonies on the reefs. Sea Gulls really do sound like they are saying mine, mine, mine! <br />Make sure you stay till the end of the credits there are some fishy comedians around the end! <br /> <br />
B000002UY5|5.0|This album is great,of course like alot of people,I came to know this band because of No Rain.But after hearing the entire album I was amazed at how much of a great rock album this was.I was under the impression these guys were grunge only because of the time period they became known.These guys along with GNR and the Black Crowes were probably the last of the great rock n roll acts still kickin it in the 90s.Hoon's voice is amazing.He reminds me of Janis Joplin at times with his emotinal raspy wail.If you dig stuff like acoustic Zeppelin,Joplin,or psychadelic rock of the 60s and early 70s you will love this album.Every song on hear is a standout.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|If there was ever such a thing as a mixed bag, Wicked, and its accompanying CD, is just that.  There are absolutely some great things about this musical based on Gregory Maquire's novel of the same name.  However, there are bad things, and a lot of them.  Kristen Chenoweth is fabulous as G(a)linda, the effervescent, but self-centered, charmer/socialite of Munchkinland.  The score has some very good moments, and a few of the songs are extremely fun to sing along to.  However, there are some huge problems...especially if you're a fan of the novel.  The story has changed to the point of unrecognizability.  Norbert Leo Butz, who is one of my favorite singer/actors, is completely underused as Fiyero.  His character has completely changed from the book, and is not even worth writing about at this point, as he becomes a man who deserves no sympathy.  The score, less those few songs I spoke of earlier, is really not very good.  It is extremely simplistic, and doesn't really challenge the listener...although that's a problem I have with a lot of Broadway musicals today.  Joel Grey, as the Wizard, is also completely underused, squandering those talents that have made him a broadway favorite throughout the past 5 decades.  Finally, the character of Elphaba.  In my opinion, the changes in the story have completely cut out most of the sympathy I felt for her in the novel.  Idina Menzel does a decent job with what she's given, but is not, in my opinion, spectactular...although it would seem that her singing (especially on high notes) is much better on the recording than it is live.<br /><br />Overall, Wicked is, as I said, a mixed bag.  There is some good there, but there is more bad.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|Lord of the Rings Trilogy Soundtrack is one of the best epic motion picture soundtracks ever created.  The musics bring the scenes from the movie whenever they are played.  The themes are well-made and give different emotions. One can quickly remember the scene of the Bridge of Khazad Dum, Lothlorien, Gondor - Minas Tirith, the Dark Riders, the Rohirin, Battle of Helm's Deep, or even the happy scenes of the Hobbits.  Each CD consists of at least one or two beautiful vocals of female voices.  All soundtracks are composed beautifully by the great composer Howard Shore.    Disc 1 The Fellowship of the Ring - \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" gives you the happy the life of Hobbits, which I really adore.  \\"The bridge of Khazad Dum\\" gives you the frightening scenes of the deep of Moria, consisting of vocals of football players \\"hoof...hoof\\".  \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" is emotional, featuring the voice of Edward Ross and choir boys.    Disc 2 The Two Towers - The theme of the Rohirin is beautifully played, especially \\"The Riders of Rohan\\", \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\" and \\"Helm's Deep.\\"  \\"Evenstar\\" is beautifully sung by Isabel Bayrakdarian, which includes the Elvish 'Teliach  i vethed n i onnad. Si boe -dhanna. Ae -esteli, esteliach nad' meaning 'This is not the end...it is the beginning.  You cannot falter now.  If you don't trust [this], trust nothing else.'  \\"Forth Forlingas\\" and \\"Isengard Unleashed\\" are very dramatic and are my favorites.    Disc 3 The Return of the King - \\"Minas Tirith\\" and \\"The White Tree\\" brings the scenes of Gondor and the Minas Tirith city.  \\"Steward of Gondor\\" begins with the theme of Gondor and is very emotional with the lyrics sung by Billy Boyd. \\"The Black Gate Opens\\" has beautiful tunes of flutes and themes of the Fellowship in an emotional way - I love it!  \\"Into the West\\" by Annie Lennox is a beautiful and dramatic song that gives you the sense of \\"the end of a journey\\".    I highly recommend this soundtrack set for the beautiful themes and songs it holds.
B0006284JQ|4.0|This CD includes all of Britney's best but is missing one of my favorite songs & a couple other really good ones.  \\"Born to Make you Happy\\" and \\"Dont Let me be the Last to Know\\" should have been included on this CD. I also would have liked to have seen \\"I Love Rock & Roll.\\" There are pictures of the singles on the insert of the CD cover, but the songs are not on the album. <br /> <br />Other than those three songs, I cannot think of any other Britney songs that I would like to see on this album.  I do also think she included more songs that were not as popular that the ones mentioned above - but hey, its her prerogative!  Its still a great album and worth the money to have all of your Britney songs on one CD.  :) <br />
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|if your into rock this is the cd you want to get. They have amazing guitarists and an amazing drummer. I LOVE AVENGED SEVENFOLD!!!
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|The main character in this film (the photographer played by David Hemmings) is not a very sympathetic character on the surface. He seems to care little about others and is self possessed. This can be a turn off for some viewers. He is a man who seems fed up with the superficial character of the world he lives and works in, that of fashion. He seems to be searching for some form of reality in contrast to the shallowness and artificiality of this world. In his off-hours he takes photos of the contrasting reality of lower class London life. After he takes some photos of a woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and here lover in a park, she is obsessed with getting the photos back. When the Photographer blows up the photos he thinks he sees a murder victim in the photos, or does he. The photos are not that clear. A woman played by Sarah Miles says the blow-ups resemble her husband's abstract paintings. So is he seeing what he thinks he is seeing? After all the body he sees in the park is the same man who is very much alive in the Photographs. The actor Ronan O'Casey plays both. The contrast between the real and the imagined is a theme that runs through the film. When the photographer sees a model he had photographed earlier in the day at a party and says to here \\"I thought you were going to Paris.\\" She tells him she IS in Paris. To set the this theme in place the film opens with a troop of mimes doing there thing. At the end of the film the mimes reappear in the park were the photographer had thought he saw the murder. The mimes draw him into their imaginary world by getting him to retrieve an imaginary tennis ball. After he throws the imaginary ball back we here the sounds of a tennis game taking place. What is real and what is imagined? I found myself thinking about this film for days after seeing it. <br />While this film is not about the Swinging scene in London of the sixties, it does give us a glimpse of that time with; the Fashions, protest marchers, a pot party, Sexual freedom, and the Yardbirds featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck playing at the Ricky Tick Club to an uncharacteristic zombie like crowd. It is a bleak look at that scene though since few seem to be really enjoying themselves. Antonioni said of the parties he attended in London at the time that he didn't really enjoy them he only went as research for the film.  <br />When the film came out British critics didn't look on it kindly. Penelope Gilliant Wrote, \\"It comes close in its effect to one of those shiny magazine features about this month's swinging depravity. You look at the pictures, admire the eye sense not much reality and recoil.\\" Alexander Walker said, \\"There was an underlying resentment at an Italian coming over and making a film that was going to be the iconic view of Britain.\\" <br />The way that the Hemmings charter works in the film was based on fashion photographer David Bailey. Though Bailey didn't have the contempt for models that the Photographer in the film has. Besides Fashion photos Bailey took pictures of many of the famous and infamous during that era. From the film he photographed Sarah Miles and Jane Birkin (one of the wannabe models Hemmings has a romp with.) <br />For those interested in this era I suggest the books Ready Steady Go by Shawn Levy which is a string of mini biographies of the time and includes a section on the making of Blow up. And Birth of the cool, a book of Bailey Photos. <br />
0440238609|5.0|Regardless with whether you agree with the author's political and/or religious (or lack there of) convictions, this is an extraordinarily well written series.  Imaginative and compelling with unique and engaging characters.  I do agree with some of Mr. Pullman's detractors that these books should not be marketed towards children.  I do, however, think they're definitely good for Young Adults and Adult readers.  Some of the themes take a bit more critical thinking than most children are capable of doing before high school.  There is also a great deal of violence, that while necessary to the plot, I wouldn't let children under 13 read unless it were under the supervision of an adult who could explain some of the more adult matters to them.   <br /> <br />A side note to several reviewers who basically found some information on a political webpage and decided to bring their political viewpoints into the review of material they obviously hadn't read.  This is a review of a book, not the review of an author.  If you don't agree with what he has to say in speeches, go post regarding those speeches.  If you don't agree with what he has to say in his books, it would probably be a good idea to have READ those books.  There are many reviews here that disagree with the \\"anti religious\\" sentiments of the author, however all those reviewers have either read the work, or read enough about the work to be able to fake it.
0778320448|1.0|Books are supposed to make you think.  They're supposed to take you away from where you are, and show you new things.  Books like this are designed to show you places you have already been, giving you the message that everything is ok, and that everything will be ok forever.  There isn't a challenging sentence in the whole work.  I'm glad I read this after finding it left behind on a bus instead of spending my hard earned money on it.  I'd give no stars if I could. <br /> <br />And yes, I am a knitter.
B000002MG1|5.0|As far as I know, REM is one of the best rock band I've ever heard, or I should say America's Radiohead. Just like them, REM produces the finest rock albums and they are steady. I started listening to their album, Automatic For The People recently and I liked it.  <br />All the tracks were brilliantly done with many emotions mixed to them. If I can pick some of my favourite tracks, they would be Drive, Man On The Moon, Everybody Hurts and Find The River as they are the most memorable songs to me. But every single tracks on this album are standout tracks, so there are not many complaints to make about this album.  <br />Maybe if you keep listening to this album, you may get sick of the all songs since they are done with the same instruments and familiar melodies. Still if you listen it every now and then, the album's fine enough to deserve two thumbs up, 5/5....
6301969413|5.0|Here we have, in Cinerama, an epic submarine-spy-thriller-meets-action-adventure. What more could you ask for from a movie? <br /> <br />You get Patrick McGoohan as a debonair spy. You get Rock Hudson as submarine captain. You get Ernest Bourgnine doing a Russian accent (okay, that's laughable). You get decent-for-the-era special effects. You get a soundtrack of glorious movie music. <br /> <br />There are some thin parts and bits that are now somewhat dated, but mostly this thriller still thrills, justifying the long running time. The DVD is long overdue, as this is a, if not *the* classic Cold War movie. (well, maybe Dr. Strangelove probably takes that prize...)
B0006284JQ|5.0|its the best BEST songs....and the remix disk is awsome i LOVE it everyone should buy it. !!!!!!!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|The entire casing for Troy feels spot on, with the possible exception of Orlando Bloom.  Bloom plays the role of Paris quite well, but I don't know that I agree with the choice or if I agree with how pussified he is in the script.  I feel that Pitt and Bana are spot-on in their respective roles. <br /> <br />Anyway, the film is a blast.  Don't come here for a history lesson.  I've heard a lot of people critisize the film for historical inaccuracies.  So what.  I don't believe that the film was intended to be an extension of your History class.   <br /> <br />Troy is a movie that is fun to experience.  Good character development (though Achilles' could have been a little better), some decent humor, and great action.  The opening fight sequence is, in my opinion, a classic.  It's a short sequence, but it quickly conveys who you're dealing with when you mess with a combat master like Achilles. <br /> <br />If you go into this film looking for a good time (and not a history lesson), you'll get exactly what you paid for.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|this is a movie that tries to be something it is not...deep.  Yes, that is right.  This is not a deep, meaningful flick.  Not even Richard Kelly knew what the heck is was doing or even why he did it. The reasons he did give were so incredibly dissapointing and plainly idiotic.  He gets kudos for reading a couple of familiar and meaningful books but that is all.  It is just fantastic how many try to articulate supposed meanings into this film when not even its writer/director knew what the heck he was doing. There is more substance in the attempted interpretations than this film could ever have.  It is amazing how people let their imaginations run wild in trying to decifer reasons.  this is a good film to watch while reading your favorite book on a comfy couch..
B00023B1LC|5.0|I love spy movies.  I'm not talking about Bond.  I can't stomach that garbage.  I'm talking about thought-provoking plots with well-filmed action sequences.  Identity has an excellent plot, outstanding acting, and the best fight sequences this side of the Matrix. <br /> <br />I'm not going to rehash the storyline.  That's already been done.  However, I'll say that if you're any kind of action fan who appreciates a great story to go along with the buttkicking, you'll love this film.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album has almost all of her North American singles (except for two: From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know).  Besides omissions of those two tracks and the splendid Born To Make You Happy (and to a lesser extent I Love Rock 'n Roll), this collection is complete and one of the best you'll find!  It shows you why Britney has sold over 55 million albums worldwide and 30 million in the U.S. alone (and millions more singles)!    All the best tracks from the queen of pop are here!  Here are highlights:     ...Baby One More Time: This song brought Britney into the music world and made the world fall in love with her.  A true pop classic in every sense of the word!  You'll never get sick of this awesome song!  Her debut album is the best selling by a teenage solo pop artist and is only behind names like Shania, Whitney, and Alanis in terms of top-selling female album of all time!    (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix): Who doesn't remember this amazing dance track!  This song makes you wanna get up and party all night long!    Oops!...I Did It Again: The song that made Britney into one of the world's biggest superstars.  It led to Britney selling 1.3 million copies of her sophomore album in a SINGLE week!  The biggest first-week sales ever by a female!    Lucky: May not be a highlight to a lot of people, but was probably my favorite song the first time I listened to the Oops! album!  It's not my fave anymore, but it's still a solid track.    Stronger: One of my fave Britney tracks of all time.  A mindblowing video goes along with this incredible song!  Get the DVD to see it!  Ranks above Toxic and Slave as my fave vid!    I'm A Slave 4 U: If you were not a fan of Britney, but of artists like the Neptunes at the time, this song probably appealed to you!  In my opinion the hottest Britney track ever!  You cannot sit through this song without wanting to get up and dance!  Hottest beat ever!    Me Against The Music (feat. Madonna): The infamous duet with Madonna.  Even if you don't like this song or don't like Madonna, this song must have drawn your attention.  Meeting of the two female titans of the music world and it worked like a dream!  Another standout dance track!    Toxic: If you didn't like Britney before the time Toxic was released...you did after!  If you've never heard this song, you've been living under a rock!  The song that brought Britney near the heights of her peak during the Oops! era!  Sure to be another pop classic!      Everytime: Britney's most memorable ballad and one that surprised many non-Britney fans.  Soft and subtle, yet powerful and touching!  Britney wrote this song herself (it's true!) and it's simply beautiful!  A true love song that you want to listen to over and over again!    My Prerogative: Some say it's a horrible cover of Bobby's song, but I think it's hot!  It's not at Toxic's level but has a similar feel and vibe to it.  The lyrics and beat make this song stand out!        (I've Just Begun) Having My Fun: Another song with a similar feel to Toxic, but like said by many, is similar to No Doubt's songs.  Never released, but was VERY popular in internet downloads!  Find out why when you get the album!    Do Somethin': The newest Britney song and one of her best yet!  If you haven't heard this, you must!  Nothing like Britney's ever done before!  Reminiscent of Gwen's What You Waiting For!  A surefire party smash!    Phew!  And those are just my personal highlights!  There's also the other sweet ballads like Sometimes and Not A Girl (I actually really like this song!) and some red-hot smokin' remixed dance tracks like Overprotected (Darkchild Remix) and Boys (Co-Ed Remix feat. Pharrell of N.E.R.D.)!  Don't forget Outrageous, either!  The R.Kelly produced track is a sexy track and is a pretty addictive song!      The limited edition release of the album also comes in a shiny metallic box with a gorgeous layout!  Unlike regular CD's in jewel cases, it is a 3 panelcase with tons of pictures!  One flap has pictures of all Britney's album and single covers!  The booklet has tons of nostalgic value with new pictures from old photoshoots, a big collage, pictures from her music videos, and some all-new pictures!  Very well done exterior to an already amazing album!      Along with this limited release is the bonus CD with 4 new remixes and a sweet megamix featuring hits like ...Baby One More Time, Crazy, Oops!, Slave, Toxic, Everytime, and more!  The remixes all sound awesome and give a whole new feel to the songs!  The Outrageous remix is the real standout!  If you're not a fan of the original, you may love the remix!  Get this bonus while you can!  You won't regret it!    Again, it's a shame my favorite song from Britney's debut album, Born To Make You Happy and the previously mentioned ballads and international tracks aren't on the album, but to me, this album is worth every penny, even if you may already have all the songs!  Go pick it up NOW!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|While i didn't think I'd be able to say it, I have to admit that I like this CD better than \\"No pads, no helmets... just balls!<br /><br />When I first popped the CD into my player (of course on the day that it was released) I had to chuckle at some of the lyrics.  Come on now.... what guy doesn't sound a little funny singing about girls with girls that are on diet pills.  I was almost offended.  But the more I listened to the CD the more I grew to love it.<br /><br />The lyrics are deeped and the guys seemed to have grown up since their first album.  Musically the Cd is great.  I think Jeff gets to show off his skills a bit more and David and Seb are singing more.<br /><br />There's even one song (Me against the world) where there's some backgroud screaming.  I was impressed at the way the group has evolved and I look forward to what they put together in the future.
B00005JM1F|5.0|All i can think of is *FRANK THE TANK! FRANK THE TANK! FRANK THE TANK!* haha it's so funny! come on people it's a comedy! I've been reading reviews and I know it's their opinion but they were saying how it was offensive and degrating? I don't understand. Why don't you watch the movie again but with an openmind. I absolutly recommend buying this, I watch it all the time. Just pop it in and laugh my ass off! Will Farrel (my favorite), Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn were terrific in this one.
B0006284JQ|5.0|(...)  Now About the CD I must say wow I really love the packaging it was put together realy well.    1. My Prerogative (New) -  The song has this amazing Bollywood sound to it which makes it much better/catchier then the original version of Bobby Brown In My Opinion. 10/10    2. Toxic - Toxic is just such a great song you can listen to it over and over and it won't be annoying Britney's sexy voice over the strings of the violins and the catchy beat certainly makes this song one of my favs. 10/10    3. I'm A Slave 4 U - I'm A Slave 4 U is one of the best club songs of all time produced by the Neptunes. 10/10     4. Oops!...I Did It Again - One of my fav songs of all time it has such catchy words even though there cheesy words it is a great song and deff one of Britney's better songs. 10/10    5. Me Against The Music feat. Madonna - Britney and her idol Madonna hit it off on this track it's them against the music and they won, great song. 9/10     6. Stronger - This song makes me so energetic it makes me wanna dance and scream, Britney has atitude in this song and that's what I like. 10/10    7. Everytime - The ballad that has such amazing vocals and such beautiful lyrics which Britney herself wrote including the music to the song, This song is so BEAUTIFUL. 10/10     8. ...Baby One More Time - And here we are at the song that started everything. Baby One More Time is a classic the song is just one of the best Pop songs ever, You can just think of Pop culture and Baby One More Time video/song can pop in your head that's how amazing it is. 10/10    9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!) - I love this song this is the song that got me realy interested in Britney the remix of it is not on the Original album so this being here gives a fan a bigger reason to purchase this Greatest Hits album. 10/10    10. Boys (CoEd Remix Feat Pharell Williams) - Another song that is not on the original album this was remixed for the movie Austin Powers. 8/10     11. Sometimes - Beautiful song the instruments and Britney's voice blend in so well you can take a ride in the car and just leave all your worries behind while listening to the song.10/10    12. Overprotected (The Darkchild Remix) - This is also not availble on the original album, When it became a single Britney released this remix as the single so this gives all fans another much bigger reason to get this collection of hits. 10/10    13. Lucky - She's so lucky she's a star... Oops haha this song is great it is so catchy and has a great storyline in the lyrics I find this song deff classic. 10/10    14. Outrageous - This song is ok it's a great song for the summer I found myself dancing to it 5 times in a row with my friends which is funny cause they never appreciated this song so it's a great track to dance to. 6/10    15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - The song that Britney get's to express how she feels to the public and does a darn good job at it. 8/10    16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)(New) - A new song that is realy realy good it has a great upbeat sound and the lyrics is alot of fun, I like how Britney says (I've Just Begun) in the song it's like she's saying don't worry I'll be back I just began.;)10/10    17. Do Somethin' (New) - Another new song which is also great, This song is like a sister to \\"Toxic\\" it resembles the beats but Britney has atitude in this song and I love it :D 10/10    Like I said Britney songs are great there so different then what's out now and that's realy good to have.    Britney will be back and I surely can't wait to see what she has for us next!
B00004Z1MN|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said - terrific cast, terrific movie. It's a shame it wasn't promoted properly.  This one will always be a favorite.
B000002LEU|3.0|Oh come one. Who the hell buys Substance, Closer or Unknown Pleasures on CD, anymore. This is the band you either love or hate. So make with the goddamm box set and put this down! Step away. Pick it upon vinyl perhaps, along with EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN FIND!!!! BUt not on CD. The Box Set, STill, and the live stuff will do nicely, thank YOU!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Like Punch Drunk Love before it, we're given a film that is decidedly art, driven by powerful writing, dynamic direction, and compelling acting, with a main character performed by someone who is, in the eyes of most, a comic. While one might expect a Shatner-esque, over-the-top performance from Carrey, to which we've become accustomed in his comedic work, we are instead given a performance that is both subtle and remarkably powerful. This is a welcome departure from Carrey's usual work.<br /><br />Another idea that is misleading at face value is that this film is a sci-fi flick about memory erasure. While the writing does retain a Philip K. Dick relevance to the importance of memories, Kaufman's choice to make the memories being erased those of a loved one makes this much more of a common love story than a potent science fiction story -- Just about everyone who's been in a relationship that ended poorly has wanted to forget it and start over. This film explores that topic to a believable extreme, and at no point should the sci-fi hater feel oppressed by the technology involved. The main story of Joel Barish is enhanced with a superbly woven subplot involving the team erasing Joel's memory, which merges with the main plot and contributes to the film's satisfying ending. Rarely does one find writing that is both intelligent and engaging without leaving a certain contingent of its audience behind. This film appeals to both the science-fiction minded as well as those looking for a satisfying love story.<br /><br />While there's nothing particularly novel in the way of direction, there is a world of technique in Gondry's telling of this story. Because most of the story takes place in Barish's head, the visuals are subject to his ability to recall them, which leads to many artful techniques, including an impressive scene using forced perspective. Outside of Barish's mind, however, the direction is fairly standard. Perhaps Gondry did this on purpose to make Barish's memories distinguishable from what's really happening in the outside world, but these scenes are for the most part very simple and not quite as visually appealing. With the compelling acting and writing, however, one rarely notices the direction except when it does become visually apparent, which works out to the story's advantage. You don't have to worry too much about focusing on the wrong thing and missing a detail.<br /><br />This DVD edition is a welcome addition to any film lover's collection. The trip alone is worth the money, and the film is complemented by a fair amount of extras. I can't recommend it enough to fans of art films, the actors in it, science-fiction, or romance. All are catered to in this well-produced, well-written film.mories distinguishable from what's really happening in the outside world, but these scenes are for the most part very simple and not quite as visually appealing.

0670033693|5.0|I was privileged to have been able to read the first ten chapters of the manuscript of Cold Dish and continue to count the days until the finished product is released.  Mr. Johnson is an exceptional storyteller with a gift for developing fallible, yet loveable characters.  This quickly moving story is an easy read that is as intriguing as it is insightful.  With an eye for subtle detail, strong characters and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, Cold Dish will appeal to everyone who loves a good story.
B00004Z459|5.0|This was and is definitely one of the best \\"nu metal\\" albums of the year.  It's angry, passionate, succint like a Slayer album and just hits you in the face.  Each song has something about it that just makes you want to jam it more.  I dug the new album more, but go see this band live if you ever get a chance.  Each show I\\"ve seen has been incredible!  Hybrid Theory is an album to own.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a tribute to the common place, ordinary, everyman.  And it is a fantastic representation.  This film relies on sheer wit in creating its humour, which it certainly does not lack.  Napoleon Dynamite is funny in its own way.  It's the little things like the characters mannerisms and reactions that make this movie a sure cult classic. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a teen movie that throws all of the formulaic teen movie elements out the window giving this genre a fresh breath of life.  Ultimately it is the superb performances from the actors/actresses that make Napoleon Dynamite as great as it is.  <br /> <br />The premise of the movie is small town life shown through the eyes of anti-heroes.  And that is what makes Napoleon Dynamite different from other movies.  The laughs are endless and the characters are fascinating (in an ordinary way). <br /> <br />You know that a movie is truly great when you desperately don't want it to end.  And this is most certainly the case with Napoleon Dynamite!
B00005JMAH|1.0|We all knew it was going to be hard to keep the momentum going, but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in the 3rd movie. I expected that a new director would change the tone somewhat, but what the heck happened to Hogwarts?? They changed the flat landscape of the school grounds completely - now it looks like they're all scaling the craggy cliffs of Scotland! Also, Hagrid's house isn't where it's supposed to be - across the lawn from the school and at the edge of the dark forest. It's fun to see our students growing up but some of the \\"magic\\" is gone and there's no reason to start messing with background elements that are supposed to be constant. That said, now that readers have the background of the story behind them, this story is much more complex and detailed & is still very engrossing. It's a winner, but that's because of J.K. Rolling's vision, not the director's. I just wish he'd been as concerned about continuity as he was about making his mark on this already successful series of stories.
B00025ETIW|4.0|im not sure i agree with the rest of the reviewers up top, who classify this as screamo. screamo is much different, this is slightly emocore/mostly just emo. anyway, this cd is quite interesting, i burned it from one of my friends. the shining grace on this cd is the track \\"hang em high\\". come on, cowboys are cool. lets all be truthful, right? we all wish we could be cowboys. anyway, i saw them live for about three songs during warped tour this summer, and, while they do have a lot of intensity, they're still singing the same tired plot line that seems to be present in every emo bands attempts. \\"she wronged me, now im getting my revenge/now im really sad.\\" or its some sort of apology. if not for the highly creative and infectious MUSIC, i would have given this maybe one or two stars. if you want real screamo, download anything by the blood brothers, the bled, saetia, black eyes, or swans. this band is alright, but theyre a little too close to the used for comfort.
B000002JPA|4.0|I don't think I can refer to the whole album. Many people think this is Dream Theater's best album. I don't think so, because there are a few songs I don't like much (like \\"Another Day\\" which sounds to me as just a little song without grace... ). But, the thing is that this albun contains two of the best songs I have ever heard: \\"Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and The Sleeper\\" and specially \\"Learning to Live\\". Those two songs makes the whole album a very good choice. A thing to take into account, is that this was the second Dream Theater's album, I think. So, you can't expect the band to be really mature, there's a lot of experimentation, trying to find \\"their own sound\\". But, this experimentation is being taken by very good musicians, who knows a lot about music and that are very very talented at their own instruments (voice included). These guys know what they're doing. I've read some reviews about the lyrics; some giving good grades to the lyrics and some just destroying them. Well, I don't think lyrics is an important issue... I mean, the important thing is the music, the lyrics are just something that accompanies. I think it is very stupid to make a critic thinking about the lyrics. And the same thing applies for those who judge: \\"this is prog rock\\" or \\"this is not prog rock\\"... I mean, I think no one can tall what prog rock is, because you have lots of very different bands that are included under the \\"prog rock\\" label, starting from King Crimson and passing trough Yes, Queen, Rush, Pink Floyd, Queensrche, Bozzio Levin Stevens, Gordian Knot, Transatlantic, Dream Theater... And those bands are very different, you can't say \\"King Crimson is a prog rock band, but Queen isn't\\". Based on what? Progressive (not only progressive rock) it was a \\"movement\\" against the whole commercial thing, a movement that wanted to support and encourage the free musical experimentation with no limits or agreements. So... how can anybody judge what prog is? There are lots of \\"prog branches\\". I think Dream Theater is considered as \\"prog metal\\". Whatever, for those that are not that purists and just want to try things and enjoy music, I think this album is a very good choice. But, be prepared for metal and some heavy parts, as well as soft pieces such us \\"Wait for Sleep\\".
B0006284JQ|1.0|it's really pathetic that a half naked white trash [...] with no talent/bad voice has gotten this famous. it's all packaging and PR. they should have stopped her when she was pretending to sing at disneyworld. i can't believe this is being pushed as the best music around right now - what a sad time. she and others like her are making music go downhill fast - if you can call what they do \\"music\\". i for sure wouldn't want my kids to grow up listening to this - i'll be proud to show them the real thing, everywhere from jazz and blues to classic rock. i only gave this garbage 1 star because they wouldn't let me select zero.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I saw Finding Neverland tonight in a sneak preview. I wish I had words for it. Everything from the imagery to the acting to the overall everlasting, practical idealism just leaves you with a feeling of having a bird trapped in your chest, which can only be released by either laughing or crying. Everyone could use a dose of imagination in their life, even if it's just imagining the person standing next to you at the bus stop breaking out into a tap dance. <br />I highly recommend this movie; as soon as it comes out nationwide, I'll be seeing it again. And as soon as it's on DVD, I'll be first in line to buy it. :-)
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks is an great movie, sure to have you quoting various lines and making those in the know crack up. (37...) However I was very disapointed on viewing the 10th aniversary edition. The \\"Director's Cut\\" original print of the film was very much a let down as it contained only things I'd seen before from the cut footage on the original dvd. I'd definately get it over the original if there was a choice between the 2 but not in addition.
0425188809|5.0|I've read only one Dean Koontz book before reading this and that book was \\"False Memory\\" which was fast and entertaining. <br />That was one of the best books of that year.But then a friend of mine kept telling me to read \\"Watchers\\" but told me very little about the synopsis.I finally picked up a copy and it sat on my shelf for about 6 months before I finally picked it up. <br />I was on page 100 by the time I put the book down that night.It was engrossing.The story is about 30-something Travis Cornell who has lost any meaning he had in his life after the death of his wife Paula.While hunting in the woods he meets a beautiful golden retriever.The dog seems to be warning him about something in the woods.Travis takes the dog home and after learning about the dogs astonishing intelligence names the dog Einstein.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for the last month; 4 days ago I saw it on stage.  The only original lead left was Idina Menzel, but as talented as the other leads are, she was really the only one that mattered... <br />This is an incredible show.  There were parts that had the audience cracking up at every line, parts that made us cry, parts that absolutely infuriated us.  Listening to the CD, you might mistake the show for a comedy; it's not.  It's thoroughly tragic, you just laugh a lot watching the tragedy unfold.  Knowing the entire plot, even the most hilarious songs have a touch of melancholy. <br />Without seeing the show, or at least knowing the plot, there's a lot of music on this CD that seems disposable.  Even so, I was happy to pay $200 for the ticket just to see \\"Defying Gravity\\" performed live--it's one of the greatest songs to ever come out of Broadway. <br />If you enjoy music because of the talent of the performers, you need this CD.  If you're planning on seeing the show, you need this CD at least a month in advance.  If you want \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" look elsewhere--this isn't ear candy, it's well-written and challenging. <br />And that's all I have to say about that.
6305949980|5.0|Where to start? Generally speaking, Nightmare Before Christmas is about misunderstood characters who may appear evil or bad, but really are brutally honest, i.e., true to themsleves and true to where they come from, which is a magical place called Halloweentown. With a name like that, you can imagine all types of characters like Oogie Boogie, the Vampires, the Three Witches, the Evil Scientist, et. al. (and my favorite trick or treaters: Lock, Shock and Barrel). More importantly, however, this is the story of Jack Skelligton and self-discovery. As they say, it isn't about the arrival, it's about the journey getting there. I cannot recommend this movie enough except to maybe very small children due to them seeing many of the characters as \\"monsters\\" that will scare them tykes when they are trying to sleep! There are so many different ways I enjoyed it from the best soundtrack ever (Thanks Mary!) to the funny and crazy characters to the journey that Jack goes through as he finds what it means to be the Pumpkin King! Well, what are you waiting for? Buy it already and stop reading this!! <br />
B00004RJ74|1.0|Warning-- This is a rare widescreen (16:9) disk which is NOT anamorphic (sometimes labeled as \\"enhanced for 16:9 televisions\\").  That means the black bars top and bottom are hard encoded, so instead of the movie having full 480 vertical pixels, its vertical resolution is limited to about 300 pixels. Other than some early Disney titles, this is a rare exeption to the CORRECT way to master a DVD.    Some additional postscripts to help novices think about this: When an anamorphic DVD is played back on a player which is still set to the factory default of \\"4:3\\", the player itself is responsible for re-scaling 480 vertical pixels to 300 vertical pixels and putting black bars on top and bottom. This preserves correct aspect ratio (circles are circles not ovals). But when your DVD player is instructed to output to a new \\"16:9\\" screen from its set-up menu, then no re-scaling is done and the picture extends from top to bottom of active scan lines. The result is a beautiful widescreen picture with full 480 pixel vertical resolution.    Bottom line: This Dimension Collector's Series of \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is not mastered per industry anamorphic standard and looks pretty poor on new widescreen sets.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|To attmept to review this album is next to impossible, as words will not do it justice. It is simply a classic. She has a voice the is incredible.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I don't think I've ever been affected by a horror movie as much as I was by this one. It will get to you, even if you don't think so while watching the movie, just you wait. Most of my friends that I've shown this movie to had a lot of trouble sleeping for a few nights after seeing it.  Its a very well-done thriller, minus all the blood, gore, and annoying shock effect. I hate building movies up too much, so I'll leave it at that. Now go and see it for yourself.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The movie was good and if you're a true Harry Potter fan you'll love it.  I think it's the worst of the three movies, but still top notch!  However, I have no idea where they found this new Professor Dumbledore.  He is horrible!!!!  Richard Harris rest in Peace!!!!!!!!!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|almost every single shania song you sing in your car is all in this 21-song list of hits..you can hum Man!I Feel Like A Woman! and later drift into a Whose Bed Has Your Boots Been Under? mood or go through the tunnel of love with your loved one singing Forever and For Always to having a sweet,heart-felt tune of Don't!(one of the new tracks on the album)..Its that good a greatest hits! all the huge hits are on here..highly recommended to all shania fans,those to be, or those who wanna check out shania's commercial hits!...its cool considering that when artists release a hits album they only include like 12-13 tracks and one new song...but shania who so dearly thinks of her fans not only includes 17 hits but also included 3 new tracks including the mix to Party for Two offered in pop and country versions respectively...this is one heck of a hits package ladies and gents!
B00005K3NY|3.0|Many of you out there may be primarily interested in this film because of the head-explosion scene.(as was I) The question is, is this film worth renting for the head-explosion alone? The answer is yes.  Hell yes, as a matter of fact.  That has got to be the most hilarious and awesome single gore effect I've ever seen, likely topping any one efffect from the rightly vaunted Riki-Oh.  And hey, the rest of the movie ain't bad either, if you're into low-budget stuff.(which, if you're even reading this you probably are)  The acting ain't great, and the plots kinda weird, but it's plenty watchable, with an appealing earnestness to the performances, some nice action scenes, and the final showdown is pretty sweet too.  It ain't great art, I don't think, but it's good entertainment, for sure.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This greatest hits album is more than just a collection of hits.  For fans, it is a look back at all the memories, good and bad, of Britney's career.  Normally, greatest hits collections are simply singles that have been released and slapped on a CD.  Britney's greatest hits is that...and more.  She is quite possibly the most famous person in the world, the most exciting pop star since who knows when - and with that, come a roller-coaster ride of memories and emotions.  This album brings all those memories back.  From ...Baby One More Time to Oops!...I Did It Again to I'm A Slave 4 U to Toxic and beyond, this album will bring back all the reasons why you are a fan of the one and only Britney Spears.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have experienced some of the things that Miyazaki has put in &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. For example, i've had to step into fights and then get rejected by both sides. We ourselves are demons in a certain view. We hurt others when they're in the way of our dreams or whatever. For example, if I wanted to rule the world and my friend opposed me, I would hurt him. Miyazaki is clearly showing this and that's why I give &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; a 5-stars rating.
B000002LFU|5.0|Somehow not high on my list of favorite R.E.M. albums, GREEN is still an alt-pop delight and almost impossible to fault. By this point, the boys had apparently gotten a bit more comfortable with their fame and they embrace their pop potential to a greater extent. Coincidentally, this was their first release on a major label.<br /><br />The pop songs on GREEN, aside from being great songs, if nothing else prove that no one could justifiably accuse R.E.M. of maintaining a fake or pretentious underground status. They seemed to be embracing their role as one of the most popular and influential bands of their time. Even more fame and recognition was just around the corner.<br /><br />\\"Pop Song '89\\" - Fun, jaunty song, great riff. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Get Up\\" - Pop heaven. Love the \\"dream sequence\\" at the middle 8. *****<br /><br />\\"You Are the Everything\\" - more of a sweet, soothing song with an undercurrent of excitement courtesy of skillful strummer Peter Buck. Michael Stipe turns in a quirky, very creative vocal. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Stand\\" - Another fun pop song, this one got some attention as a single and video. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"World Leader Pretend\\" - a sophisticated song that seems to be about overcoming internal conflict and taking control over your life. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"The Wrong Child\\" - A strange, swirling, rather disorienting tune but quite pretty. Sung from a child's point of view, this song conveys a sort of dreamy innocence and fits in perfectly with the album's theme (the color green representing youth, inexperience, etc.) ****<br /><br />\\"Orange Crush\\" - This is top-shelf alt-rock like only R.E.M. can deliver. *****<br /><br />\\"Turn You Inside Out\\" - An infectious rhythm drives this one.  Killer cut! *****<br /><br />\\"Hairshirt\\" - Another weird track and one of my favorites by R.E.M. A strummed mandolin (I'm guessing - the instrument appears on other GREEN tracks as well) guides this unusual piece that's also quite warm and positive. *****<br /><br />\\"I Remember California\\" - Cool song, but sometimes feels a bit draggy if I'm not in the mood for it. One could say it's a bit heavy and lethergic, but it's also hazy and mysterious. ****<br /><br />(bonus cut) - An agreeable, sweet little tune, slightly awkward. A nice album closer. ****tive. ***** <br /> <br />\\"I Remember California\\" - Cool song, but sometimes feels a bit draggy if I'm not in the mood for it.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Let's get one thing clear. Before one takes their imagination and flushes it down the toilet with their eyes gazed on the newest Hollywood \\"masterpiece\\" of run-of-the-mill, cliche storytelling and delivery, one can easily assume that all innovative filmmakers will inevitably go this route of mass appeal. Case in point: Tim Burton and \\"Planet of the Apes\\". David Fincher and \\"Panic Room\\".  <br /> <br />Charlie Kaufman, we're still waiting. <br /> <br />There are times when a moviegoer watches a very skillfully crafted film, thinking to themself how an director or writer could possibly come up with this creatively exhibited idea. Then one could even take it up one notch, and in this case, a few.  <br /> <br />After the somewhat disappointing \\"Adaptation\\", the follow-up to the stellar \\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" taps into senses and emotions. In this case, catharsis is apparent, but it is done so seamlessly, one could have trouble noticing it.  <br /> <br />Assuming that the review reader knows the synopsis of this film, it is apparent that \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is far superior to any other Kaufman offering, and quite possibly any other movie release in 2004.  <br /> <br />The most memorable scenes in this movie involve Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who give superb performances repectively. They work perfectly together, contrasting and connecting in a very human way, a very real way. <br /> <br />Story \\"morals\\" can be seen as cliche, but this movie does it so perfectly, it is barely noticable that it is purposely conveyed. It is interpreted that the moral is not told by one particular facet of the movie, because the movie speaks for itself. In short: cherish your memories, good or bad. Your brain is the singlemost important part of you, and the idea of erasing memories may be a quick fix for pain, but in the long run the real pain will be losing all the good times you had together. <br /> <br />
B0006J28BO|4.0|I am not doing this review based on the Disney release, but on the original Japanese release.  This charming little story is a product of Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, but it is directed by Miyazaki's associate, Hiroyuki Morita.  It is actually a sequel to the excellent and equally charming Whisper of the Heart, another beautiful though very low-key Ghibli product.  The strange thing is that Whisper of the Heart has never been released in the U.S.; releasing the sequel before the original is a bit odd. <br /> <br />That being said, a wealth of details about the films (and everything from Studio Ghibli) can be found on the tremendously informative nausicaa.net Web site.  Since this film is being released with Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind and Porco Rosso on February 22, it can only be hoped that it will ride somewhat on the coattails of the two better-known Miyazaki works and will have decent sales.  It's an excellent family film and is a refreshing change (like all of Ghibli's works) from giant robots, ninjas, vampires, brainless lowbrow comedy mixed with mindless violence, and the other junk that pervades way too much of contemporary anime releases.
B00005CDNI|5.0|Too much filth has come from the Pop spectre of music as of lately.Repeated formulas, looks, songs and even \\"singers\\" that sound very much alike from one another(!)abound in radio stations for our discomfort.Yet, we have albums like this to remember us of how Pop should be.But i'm afraid that there's nowhere in the scene to be found who can do it at this high level of songcraft. <br />In the context of time, when this album whas released Abba embraced the Disco Music of that era and made it their own, making a masterpiece that can very well be used to dance but should always be viewed as a perfect combination of soaring melodies, choruses and awe inspiring, catchy, memorable music for years to come.Otherwise it can not be explained how we delight ourselves nowadays with it. <br />I will take the opportunity to talk about some jerks who say that Chiquitita is ridiculous and sugary-sweet crap..WHO on earth <br />could say that? A stylish folk-like ballad, high spirited and with several instances of conterpoints and classical played piano a piece of crap? Don't be ignorants, dudes! <br />Buy it for state-of-the-art melodic music entertainment. <br />

068987474X|5.0|The book, He's Just Not That Into You' was givein to me by my sister because i was going thru a break up with my Ex. I personaly think that every girl.. even if u have a bf should read this. because you just might find out that he's just not that into, as you thought he was. The book gives storys about different situations on alot of things u need to know about guys and how they think. You know when a guy breaks up with you, and your like.. but i know he misses me, or if i just hang out with him he's gonna realize that he wants me back, or Im a nice person, he's not gonna find someone else like me, so he's forsure gonna come back. well u will find the answers to all that and MORE in this book. Befor i got the book, i was so down on myself, thinking it was something i did wrong. 'What if i hadn't have sayd this, or did that.\\" This book makes u really realize it's NOT your fault. It makes u realize you are a good person and that u deserve all the love in the world. u deserve a guy that is into you. not a guy that's just not that into you. so get the book, it will make a whole hell of a lot of differance in what u think. and it makes you feel better about yourself, it makes u feel like there is someone out there for you. And there is. In the words of Greg, 'Don't waste the pretty'!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania's greatest hit cd is a must have for any Shania fan!  It's hard to believe she has had so many hits after only 3 albums, but she does.  The cd is loaded from start to finish with some of music's all time classics.  Don't wait get your copy today!
B00003CXPD|4.0|This film paints a great picture of how staying true to one's self can be difficult, but worth it.  The lead character is perfectly cast, and the dialogue is tough, gritty, and real.  I found the 'angry tap-dance' to be an exceptionally strong scene - a tremendous release from the tension caused by Billy's situation.  Movies like this provide the very best response to art - the transcendence of the human spirit.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I have been an avid fan of the Gilmore Girls show since it's first episode, mainly for its general excellence. In my opinion, I feel there's far too much sex and violence in our world and on television, and the networks have the nerve to insult our intelligence by calling it entertainment. The Gilmore Girls is pure entertainment. It deals with relationships and subject matters in a somewhat realistic manner. Not all of their episodes are tied up into neat little packages, nor do they end on a high note. It is also my way of escaping from the sadness and pain I see around me, even if it's just for an hour. I get a generally great feeling after watching this show because it also shows me that humanity, love, kindness and respect is not completely lost.  <br />I read a certain one star review of this show, so I took the time to view other reviews by this 'critic' whom I understand is entitled to his opinion, however, most of his reviews are given one star. I'm sorry to say his review was not helpful at all, and if I were to make a decision based solely on his reviews, I would never purchase anything. He doesn't seem to like anything.  <br /> <br />I'm happy to say that the majority of the reviews for this show are very positive and helpful, and the majority rules this time. If you want to view quality television, I highly recommend The Gilmore Girls, and when this box set is released, you will definitely not regret making this purchase.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I teach kindergarten and Polar Express has long been one of my favorite Christmas books.  When I first saw the trailer for the movie almost a year ago, it took my breath away. I have been so excited about the movie's release that I have been counting the days.  To Mr. Wharton I will say, if we make judgements based on such limited information (as say a movie trailer), I wouldn't put much stock in the opinion of someone who can't even spell correctly.  If high quality and perfection are the qualities you seek, start first with yourself.  Personally, I thought the trailer did exactly what was intended - it presented just enough to whet the appetite without giving away the entire movie.  I hope you will go see the movie with an open mind rather than a preconceived idea influenced by your limited expectations.  Keep in mind however that this is a story for children based on great children's literature. As a teacher, I am thrilled to finally see such quality in film for young children after so much junk (I am not referring to Pixar).
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure`s moody and mood enhancing melodies and words say what most people would say if they could write poetry or had the\\"Gift\\"to put what they wanted to say into words.Alot of bands of this ganra often have \\"you figour it out lyrics\\"or come off sappy when trying to be deep.The Cure dos`nt do that.This band has been around along time,Like The Sisters of Mercy, bauhous, and The Fields Of The Nephlim,equaly great bands, they put the \\"Goth\\" in \\"Goth\\".At the time this music hit there was`nt a catogory for it, being unlike \\"Punk\\"and \\"Industrial\\" which was floating around at the time.Suddenly guys and girls were seen wearing pale or white foundation and dark eyeliner and black or deep red hair.Black clothing a must, along with leather jackets,skullls, nose piercings and the guys wearing earings in both ears and of course the\\" vampire\\" stories of Ann Rice helped fuel this new \\"scene.This was \\"Goth\\" in it`s infancy.I know because I was there.This music changed my life,in fact  \\"Love Song\\" was played at my wedding and the rest of the album got me through the breakup.The cure are like that.They can laugh with you as in Kis Me Kis Me and head on The Door, two other great albums,or be sad, realy sad.The Cure cries with you.Robert Smith`s vocal, beautiful guitars and keybaurds are the trade- marks of this band. if you are a \\"Goth\\" this is your bible. If you are looking to add to your musical pallet then get this.This album is better than any words I could write.That`s why I love it.
B0006284JQ|3.0|Britney Spears is one of the greatest entertainers of the past decade without a question. And while there has been a lot of controversy surronding the queen of pop's every move, lets be honest here, Britney was successful not because of her sexuality, or because of her extensive media obsession, it wasn't because she was gorgeous, and it wasn't because she was every man's dream. While these things certainly did help, the real reason that she was successful is because once all the smoke cleared and the talking ceazed, the music was there. It was great pop music, some of it being a contender for the best of all time. She may not have had Christina's voice, but she had the hits and My Prerogative goes to show just how many she has.<br /><br />You get the ones that started it all; \\"Baby One more Time\\", \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" & \\"Oops! I Did it Again\\", and you get the ones that kept it going \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Toxic\\" & her newest \\"My Prerogative\\". \\"Me Against the Music\\" & \\"Everytime\\" from 2003's In the Zone are two of my all time favorite Britney songs, and who can resist the remixes of \\"Boys\\" with Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes & \\"Overprotected\\". Even the new songs, \\"(I've Just Begun) Having my Fun\\" & \\"Do Somethin\\" show that she is progressing and changing with the times, she is not afraid to reinvent herself and that shows her undeniable staying power.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with this disc is that you don't get all of Britney's hits. Where are \\"Born to Make You Happy\\", \\"From the Bottom of my Broken Heart\\" & \\"Don't Let me Be the Last to Know\\"? I mean they were all included on the Greatest Hits DVD how come they weren't availble to those who bought the audio version of the compilation? Also there are some skippers on here such as \\"Lucky\\" & \\"Stronger\\" two songs that I really didn't get into the first time around either.<br /><br />These hits are nostalgic, they bring you back to the time when you were growing up and those care free days when you first heard Britney on the radio and dancing down the halls of her catholic school girl outfit. Britney is a true entertainer and a phenom in her own right. The bonus disc filled with remixes is fantastic also, and me being a huge sucker for techno remixes was more than excited. Just wish that the album could have included all of her hits, other than that this is a great collection.st heard Britney on the radio and dancing down the halls of her catholic school girl outfit.

B0002S94OS|3.0|For starters, I really do like this album.  \\"Laid to Rest\\" is an awesome metal track.  However, I just do not feel that this album is on par with \\"As the Palaces Burn\\".  They have fixed some problems from their earlier releases, with the most obvious fix being that Randy's vocals are no longer consistently drowned out by the rest of the band.  Opposing the progress of the fixed problems are some mediocre songs by Lamb of God standards.  I would still get this one if you are a fan, just don't expect another \\"Palaces\\", or you'll be disappointed.
B000002LUB|5.0|When I heard the news that the \\"Mob Rules\\" lineup of Black Sabbath (probably the only other lineup to have any credibility with the \\"Ozzy-only\\" cult) were reuniting, I had mixed feelings.  I loved Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio, so I thought \\"this could be really good\\".  However, I had also quite enjoyed the albums with Tony Martin, especially \\"TYR\\", and I thought it was a shame to throw that away (I still think that). <br /> <br />Also, I knew that both Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi are very strong-headed individuals, and, simply, I wondered how long it could last.  As much as I like him, I don't think Dio is capable of being in a band he's not in control of. <br /> <br />The music on this album was a very pleasant surprise, however.  It's not a retread of \\"Heaven and Hell\\" or \\"Mob Rules\\".  It's recognisably the same band, but it's a lot rawer and more spontaneous (odd, given the tribulations that went into its making).  Needless to say, it's also quite heavy.  It also marked a transition for Dio from writing about mostly fantasy subjects to using such imagery to illustrate real-world events. <br /> <br />The musicianship and production (by \\"Mack\\" - hard to believe it's the same guy who disco-ed out Queen on \\"Hot Space\\"!) are fine.  The vocals, songwriting and instrumentation are excellent, and stand up easily with anything either Sabbath or Dio have done before or since (however, a friend of mine said, \\"it sounds too much like a Dio album...I thought it was going to sound more like the old Ozzy stuff.\\"  Go figure). <br /> <br />\\"Computer God\\" - A good, slow, grinding, pounder of a number to start with.  Vinnie Appice makes his presence known right away.  Listening in 2004 to these 1992 lyrics about technology taking over the human race, Dio's sense of things to come is almost frighteningly prescient. <br /> <br />\\"After All (The Dead)\\" - Creepy Sabbath lyrics (though not as cliched as the Satan-fest on \\"Headless Cross\\") accompany a strong, heavy song. <br /> <br/>\\"TV Crimes\\" - Dio again uses his soapbox to speak out against televangelists who prey upon the poor.  By the way, I've seen two different videos for this. <br /> <br />\\"Letters From Earth\\" - I wonder if this is RJD taking the position of someone on Earth talking to God, saying \\"I really don't fit in here.\\"  He does it quite well and the music is good. <br /> <br />\\"Master Of Insanity\\" - Along with \\"Time Machine\\", this is probably the most \\"commercial\\" track on the album - but only in relative terms.  It also sounds the most like something that could have come off a Dio album.  Very cool Geezer bass intro! <br /> <br />\\"Time Machine\\" - There are two versions of this on the CD and I like the \\"Wayne's World\\" version better, so I'll wait until I get to that. <br /> <br />\\"Sins Of The Father\\" - Imagery from the Old Testament of the Bible for the song title.  However, I think it's about coming to terms with one's past failings, errors, etc. <br /> <br />\\"Too Late\\" - This is the only song where Geoff Nicholls' keyboards are really noticeable, accompanying Iommi's deceptively-gentle acoustic intro before he lets the riffs fly.  Dio sings like a man possessed here, fitting given the subject matter (beware the dark side!). <br /> <br />\\"I\\" - My personal favourite track on the album and quite a fist-pumper live.  Another cool Geezer bass intro leads into one of Sabbath's heaviest, most angry songs. <br /> <br />\\"Buried Alive\\" - Crushing Iommi riff #1,000,000,000!  Sounds almost like it could have come off \\"Born Again\\".  Dio's lyrics are a bit of an attack on organised religion.  As a Christian, not my favourite subject lyrically but he's entitled to his views and this really is a killer song. <br /> <br />\\"Time Machine ('Wayne's World' version)\\" - I like this better than the re-recorded version, maybe because I heard it as a \\"taster\\" from the soundtrack album before \\"Dehumanizer\\" was released.  Dio references \\"Mob Rules\\" in this version with the line \\"if you listen to fools!\\".  Good Geezer bass mid-section.  Unfortunately, in the movie itself, you only got to hear about two seconds of the actual song!  I saw them on the 1994 \\"Cross Purposes\\" tour with Tony Martin and they opened with this song.  Martin did a very good job with it. <br /> <br />This was too good to last, but I'm glad it happened, not least because I got to see the tour and the Dio lineup was always the one I'd wanted to see.  They didn't disappoint live, despite some technical hiccups. <br /> <br />Of course, the story of how Dio refused (rightly) to take the stage with Ozzy is well-known, and led to this lineup's demise.  I don't think it could've ended any other way. <br /> <br />I would rate this as one of the best Black Sabbath albums of all time, and indeed an \\"essential purchase.\\"
0679735259|5.0|I have to agree with John LeCarre'. This is the best Vietnam book I've read. Herr has written the Tarentino movie of war books. He has managed to capture the whacked-out unreality of that war like nobody else, probably because of his unique ability and willingness to see the war from all angles. Masterful- The vivid description of being shot at in the mud and cold vs. the press releases of the generals in Saigon, body bags ever present. Time warps- A base defended to the death only to be abandoned a few months later, a city (Hue) fought over and turned to rubble , only to be peaceful and clean on the next visit. Another city (Saigon) supposedly a safe haven yet more dangerous than the field in it's own way. Dope-smoking foul-mouthed soldiers doing a good job and being polite. Crazy personalities who fit right in. <br />So...Do Not expect the usual history book time lines, battle drawings, etc. If a book interests you that portrays the Vietnam war as the vertigo-inducing insanity that it truely was, this is it. You will  be right there unbalanced by the language, sounds, scenery, smells and, yes, the incoming artillery. You will be amazed at the end that Mr. Herr has given you such a clear understanding. In passing (political comment), you will also gain an appreciation of the mental problems that so many of our troops developed when they returned to \\"the World.\\" A must read.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I rented Before Sunrise just one week before I saw Before Sunset in the theater. I was so glad that I didn't see the prequel 9 years ago, otherwise it would've been a long wait for the Sunset. I'd enjoyed Sunrise very much, because it was a trully original romantic movie without the formulas and big sets used by Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, and Reese Witherspoon. It was a beautiful story about love at first sight. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy gave very natural performances as if they were \\"living\\" in this movie.<br />  There were many funny and touching moments filled with introspective dialogues that worked perfectly for this documentary-style film. I've never quite enjoyed Ethan Hawke until Before Sunrise. He was funny and charming, which was very different from his action roles. Julie Delpy may not have been the most memorable star of Three Colours: Blue(Juliette Binoche), Red(Irene Jacobs), and White(Julie Delpy), because Zbigniew Zamachowski stole the movie. Before Sunrise was the perfect vehicle for her to play a young French woman who is sexy, naive, and vulnerable. She carried through the film with a flawless performance.<br />  Sunrise left me wondering what would happen to Jesse(Ethan Hawke) and Celine(Julie Delpy). Did they see each other again after 6 months when they departed at the train station?<br />  In Before Sunset, Celine showed up at the book store in Paris where Jesse was doing a promotion for his novel that was based on his half-day experience with a French girl in Vienna 9 years ago. They went for coffee, a walk on the streets of Paris, and a boat ride on the river. They had some serious catching up to do before they had to say goodbye at Sunset. Jesse was very disappointed that Celine didn't showed up on their second date, because her grandmother died that week. unfortunately, they never reconnected again, because they didn't have each other's number. Even though Celine had lived in New York for a year, they never ran into each other. Jesse got married and has a son, but for years he never stopped thinking about Celine. As for Celine, she had her share of bad boyfriends over the years, and she regretted for not going to meet Jesse.<br />  It was very eomotionally impacting to see Celine on the verge of crying when she was riding in the car with Jesse. They both wanted each other so badly, and wished they could have another chance. It was amazing to see Hawke and Delpy delivering intense dialogues that was 5-10 minutes long in one take. The whole movie was shot in real time, so it fell like I was following them for 80 minutes throughout the movie.<br />  Celine invited Jesse back to her place for tea. She sang him a song that had his name in it, and did her little Nina Simone impersonation while she was making the tea. Jesse smiled with amusement and deep down he was wondering when they'll be together again. And I wonder if they'll be another episode to this unfinished love story.d has a son, but for years he never stopped thinking about Celine.

B00004TS0E|1.0|<br />Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus! However... His name is Edmund Gwenn, not Richard Attenborough. <br /> <br />I'm normally not one of these cinema purists who gripes over remakes of great films, but the remake of \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" may be the worst rehash job, second only to the horrid rehash of \\"La Femme Nikita.\\" <br /> <br />There are just some movies that you just do not go and remake. Would you remake \\"It's a Wonderful Life?\\" (oooops... forgot about Marlo Thomas as a female George Bailey in a TV movie). Would you remake \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington?\\" (wha... they made a TV series of it starring Fess Parker as Mr. Smith?) . Okay, maybe there are way too many bad remakes of classic films. Still, this is one of the most prolific in the bad rehash category. <br /> <br />First off, the excellent cast in John Hughes' rewrite of this Christmas classic is not the problem; the problem is John Hughes' rewrite of this Christmas classic. The tale was told beautifully the first time around back in 1947, a straightforward story pitting faith against cynicism: the happy-go-lucky do-good attorney (which makes for a great fantasy film right off the bat!) versus the Santa cynics, headed by the snotty psychoanalyst Mr. Sawyer. John Hughes seems to fancy this remake a deep work of comparative literature in need of characters with complex motivations. In 1947, Santa loses his cool with Mr. Sawyer's mean spirit toward a good-natured kid named Alfred, and he rewards Mr. Sawyer with a rap on the head. In 1994, Santa loses his cool only after a \\"set up,\\" in which a disgruntled employee goads dear St Nick into a fight by alleging that his motives for being kind to kids are.....impure. PLEASE! Can't Santa lose his cool once in a century over a guy just because the shrink is an obnoxious pig? <br /> <br />*****SPOILER ALERT! --- if you have not seen either version of this film and intend to do so, you might want to SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH***** <br /> <br />The prime comparison that sticks out in my head takes place in the courtroom. In the original, Mr. Macy, on the stand, is put on the spot, and asked if he believes the man before him to be the one and only Santa Claus. Ever the old-movie sturdy-based man of business, Mr. Macy hardly changes his stoic facial expression; rather, we see a short glimpse into his mind, picturing the happy faces of the children as they watch Santa Claus in the parade. Then, without so much as a smile or a bat of the eye, he affirms that he believes Kris to be the one-and-only Santa Claus. This remake replaces that priceless scene with the court's judge leaping merrily out of his seat with a Flintstone sized grin screaming \\"I BELIEVE!\\" Oooh! Ouch! No! <br /> <br />Lastly, I hate to bag on such a fine cast, but Richard Attenborough's Santa looks like Scrooge in comparison to Edmund Gwenn. Gwenn knew that Santa Claus was warm, buoyant, and full of cheer. Attenborough looks as if he went through every Stanislavsky manual he could get his hands on to figure out what really lies behind Santa's moods and motivations. For the love of...HE'S JOLLY OLD ST. NICK!!!!! That's Santa's charm, he's a fantastic being in the real world, THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM SO INTRIGUING!!! <br /> <br />That said, check out the version with Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne, because it is one of the greatest Christmas films ever made. <br />
6304613199|5.0|This film, directed by Steven Spielberg, picks up four years after the events of \\"Jurassic Park\\".  On a nearby island, dinosaurs have survived and have been allowed to roam free until an unsuspecting British couple and their young daughter stumble across the island.  Meanwhile, InGen director John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has summoned Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to lead an expedition to the island.  But, Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), along with the help of big game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlehwaite) are on an expedition of their own to the island to capture and bring the dinosaurs to the mainland as part of an amusement park attraction in San Diego. <br /> <br />Unknown to Ian, Hammond has solicited the help of Ian's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) to be part of the expedition.  Ian, along with the help of videographer Nick (Vince Vaughn) and gadget guy Eddie (Richard Schiff) set off somewhat against their will to link up with Sarah. Sarah has a theory that dinosaur species, especially the T-Rex, display parental instincts much the same as people and other mammals, and she is determined to prove her theory correct no matter what the cost. <br /> <br />Soon, both groups are on the island.  Peter's group is busy trying to capture the dinosaurs for their exhibit, while Sarah, Ian, Eddie, and Nick continue to study the dinosaurs themselves.  Soon, the T-Rex's nest is found, along with a baby, but the baby is suffering from a broken leg.  Sarah scoops the baby up and is determined to fix the leg, but the baby's cries alert the parents, and soon the mother and father T-Rex are bearing down on the group.  Trapped inside their command post RV, the adult T-Rexs begin banging themselves into the RV until it is dangling precariously over a cliff with Ian, Sarah, and Vince clinging to a rope overhanging the cliff.  In the best scene of the movie, the RV and trailer fall over the cliff, with Ian, Sarah, and Vince passing straight through as the RV falls. <br /> <br />They are rescued by Roland and his group, and now the two groups must survive together.   <br /> <br />I thought this was a very exciting and well-made movie.  Steven Spielberg chose an excellent cast of actors, and the special effects, especially the dinosaurs and the scene with the RV dangling from the cliff, along with the dinosaur-laden ship slamming into the pier in San Diego combine to make this a truly edge-of-your-seat movie that will keep you glued to the screen.    I highly recommend this movie.  The action is non stop, and the effects will blow you away.

Love that fierce coat she wore in the \\"Don't Impress Me Much\\" video. \\"I'm Gonna Get Ya Good\\" is the standout tune in this sea of greats!<br /><br />Here's to looking forward to another Greatest Hits package 20 years down the road.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|Being a long time Clapton fan, especially his live DVDs, attracted me to this release. I have found over the years that I have tended to like the music that the musicians I like like, so this seemed a natural.  The concert was to raise money for his Crossroads rehab center in Antigua and showcase a number of the guitar players he would like to listen to. You have an eclectic mix of guitar artists playing Blues, Country, Rock & Roll, Gospel, Folk, Jazz and Indian. The performers ranged in age from 20 to 80+, so not only do you get a number of types of guitar music, but a number of generations playing their brand. Great event, very good quality video, good sound (haven't figured out why they offer 5.1, certainly didn't take advantage of it) great music.  You are bound to enjoy most of performers on the two DVDs. There are many songs that have all-star backup performers, so look and listen closely. I gave this a 4* overall, but give it a 5* for the performers I liked. Good opportunity to broaden my tastes.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|When I first saw Eurotrip, I just couldn't stop laughing. It was so hilarious. And now, after seeing it about a dozen times, the effect is still the same. I mean, the jokes in this movie are just so great.<br />And also the characters are great. Every single one of them. I mean predictable Scotty, my retarded friend Cooper, the nerd Jamie, cute Jenny, beautiful Fiona and all the way to the funny soccer hooligans. Maybe some people were feeling insulted after seeing it (the scene with the little 'Hitler' boy, the scene in Bratislava,...), but the movie is still great. It just shows the American stereotypes about European people (like the [...] guy from Italy,...) and it also shows how American people don't know nothing about the rest of the world (Europe is NOT a country).<br />But all this facts, in the end, make a movie so great. So if you are lookin a movie, which will really make you laugh, i definitely recommend you Eurotrip.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie in the whole world. I love the characters and the cool places and the total drama and humor. This movie even caught the intrest of my husband and children. Now that says alot. I highly recommend this movie to anyone!!!!
B0006284JQ|5.0|All I've read regarding this album is \\"rockist\\" propaganda about how Britney is too young/too inexperienced/too \\"horrible\\" to have released a greatest hits album... <br /> <br />...look at the numbers, buddy, and read the track listing.  Any casual radio listener will recognize almost every track--a feat rarely accomplished by collections from other artists.  Brit is the only female artist in history to have every album (including this one?) debut at number one, as well as selling over 40 million albums.  In the one-hit wonder pop landscape, Britney is already a historical landmark. <br /> <br />As for the album itself, one could hardly ask for more.  As previously mentioned, we get every major song she's released (including, to my dismay, the \\"Outrageous\\" single--a horridly executed track Jive pushed down our throats to capture a demographic--while excluding the fantastically underrated \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" and the unimpressive ballads \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\"). <br /> <br />Additionally, we receive 3 new tracks.  To follow the recent trend of 80s-covers-as-greatest-hits-album-singles (No Doubt, Korn), Britney offers her sexy romp \\"My Prerogative\\"--fun, but not worthy of eponymy.  Rounding out the album is \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun),\\" an outtake from \\"In the Zone\\" that was downloaded so many times (mistakenly, by fans seeking the greatest hits single) that it was added, and \\"Do Somethin',\\" a track produced by the makers of \\"Toxic\\" that is quickly becoming my fave Brit track EVER. <br /> <br />That's right, 14 TRACKS you know (and love!) plus 3 NEW ONES, 2 of which are good and ONE THAT'S AWESOME.  Again, quite a feat for a greatest hits album. <br /> <br />Then there's the matter of the remix CD...I already own 2 of the remixes, and \\"Breathe on Me\\" redux falls quite short of the brilliant original.  The \\"Megamix\\" is as cheesy and fun as you expect...but the \\"Outrageous\\" remix is unbelievably great--it joins the small pantheon of songs \\"better than the original.\\" <br /> <br />So in short, anyone who is not completely insecure about enjoying fantastic pop music will find this disc in their stereos for a while.  Buy it, import it, IPOD it, and buy the DVD.  VIVA LA BRITNEY!!!
6305263248|5.0|Ronin is a hidden gem. If you haven't seen it, you have missed one of the best-made movies of the last 20 years. It is an action movie with emotional power. It is a film of subtlety as well as heart-pounding, beautifully-filmed action. Courage, love, honesty, and loyalty in the midst of betrayal are all themes that the movie artfully explores and develops. Alert viewers will note how the theme of \\"waiting\\" is woven through the plot. The development of the relationships between the characters is wonderful to watch. The conversation between Sam and the Ronin model-maker is especially delightful, as they speak a \\"language\\" they both understand, but you don't. My only caveat are several instances of unnecessary profanity (\\"Unnecessary profanity\\" is, of course, redundant). I watch the movie with a ClearPlay DVD player and filter so the profanity is muted out when I watch it, but if you don't have a ClearPlay DVD machine, you will hear it. Also, there is considerable violence in certain scenes as \\"civilians\\" get caught in crossfire. I rate it only four stars for these reasons. Otherwise, good movie.
B000002J2F|5.0|The term \\"masterpiece\\" isn't thrown around lightly by me.  So when I term Genesis 1980 effort \\"Duke\\" a masterpiece, it really doesn't get much better than this.   Many look upon \\"Duke\\" as the last hurrah in terms of Genesis being a full-fledged Progressive Rock band (I think the next effort \\"Abacab\\" still showed some Progressive Rock life left in the band).   Some will also look at \\"Duke\\" as showing some of the early signs of Genesis turning the corner into becoming a mainstream/pop band (which to some extent is fair).  Whatever the case, \\"Duke\\" scores big.    <br /> <br />When I look at Genesis as band, I see four distinct phases the band has gone through.   Phase 1 is the Peter Gabriel Era.  This spans from 1969 (\\"From Genesis to Revelation\\") to 1974 (\\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\").   It was during Phase 1 that Peter Gabriel was the lead vocalist and Genesis could easily be categorized as a progressive Rock band.   Phase 2 is the Early Phil Collins Era spanning from 1976 (\\"A Trick of the Tail\\") to 1982 (\\"Three Sides Live\\").  In this era, Phil Collins took over as lead singer.   The band was still very much a progressive rock band, but as the progressive rock landscape would change - so would Genesis.  This might indirectly have led to Phase 3 which is the Late Phil Collins Era from 1983 (\\"Genesis\\") to 1993 (\\"The Way We Walk Volume 2: The Longs\\").   This is the commercial/pop era that I referred to earlier.  At this point, there would be a lot less progressive rock flavor to Genesis' music.   The fourth phase, Phase 4 is the Ray Wilson Era.  This was when Ray Wilson took over as lead vocalist for Phil Collins.   There would only be one album in this era - 1997's  \\"Calling All Stations\\" and it seemed like Genesis tried to recapture some of their progressive rock roots - but 90s style.  \\"Duke\\" was basically done toward the end of Phase 2.  <br /> <br />In terms of being a Progressive Rock album, \\"Duke\\" clearly falls into this category.  The nice thing about \\"Duke\\"is that while it does stick to the Progressive Rock roots, it has the type of sound that will appeal to the mainstream fan.  Throw in three songs that would be classified mainstream (\\"Please Don't Ask\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\" and \\"Turn It On Again\\") and it solidifies this broad appeal.   In keeping with the times (1980), it seems as though Genesis strives to wrap this up into a \\"Concept\\" type album.   The \\"Concept\\" isn't quite tangible, but many of the songs seem to have an interwoven thread.   Using my imagination, I take the album to be a musical journey by someone named \\"Duke\\".   <br /> <br />Another interesting thing is that 5 songs are credited as being written by the combination of Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, and Phil Collins.  However the remaining seven songs are credited as being written individually by Tony Banks (who has 3), Mike Rutherford (who has 2), and Phil Collins (who has 2).  You can see that Phil has the most \\"Pop\\" influence with the songs \\"Misunderstanding\\" and the ballad \\"Please Don't Ask\\".   I think Tony has the most Progressive Rock sounding songs (\\"Guide Vocal\\", \\"Heathaze\\", and \\"Cul De Sac\\").   Mike straddles between the fence of Progressive (\\"Man Of Our Times\\") and quasi-Pop (\\"Alone Tonight\\"). <br /> <br />The collection starts off with a four song \\"suite\\".  These are basically four songs that segue one into another.   The suite starts off with \\"Behind the Lines\\".  This is a song that Phil Collins would also cover on his \\"Face Value\\" solo album.  This is a jointly written song by the trio and really kicks off the \\"musical journey\\".  I think Collins' drums are incredible on this song.   The song then eases into what is the suite and the collection's most powerful track - \\"Duchess\\".  The music slows down and then builds back up over 2 minutes into some powerful and emotional music.  You can hear the raw emotion in Phil's voice and Tony's keyboard playing.  \\"Duchess\\", which seems to be the story of a female performer named \\"Duchess\\" was anothertrack written by the trio.   \\"Duchess\\" progresses nicely into the third song of the suite which is Tony's (written) \\"Guide Vocal\\".  This is a short and soft song 1:30+ minute song which is the perfect interlude to Mike's (written) \\"Man of All Seasons\\".   On this track the trio has their \\"A\\" game with Phil's percussion, Tony's keyboards and Mike's guitars.  This is a nice wrap up to almost 20 minutes of non-stop music. <br /> <br />When I first got \\"Duke\\", I got it on LP.  I always considered the second side of \\"Duke\\" (last 6 songs on the CD) one of the greatest album sides of all time.  Sure \\"Turn It On Again\\" is a classic, but all the songs contributed. One very powerful song is Tony's (written) \\"Cul De Sac\\".   This is a classic Progressive Rock tune.  The set wraps up with another segue of \\"Duke's Travels\\" and \\"Duke's End\\".  \\"Duke's Travels is almost a full instrumental.  No lyrics are listed for this song in the liner notes, but about 6+ minutes into the song, Phil will sing.  \\"Duke's End\\" is a perfect wrap-up as it incorparates sounds from \\"Behind the Lines\\" and \\"Turn It On Again\\".   \\"Alone Tonight\\" was a song that sat perfectly between \\"Turn It On Again\\" and \\"Cul De Sac\\" while \\"Please Don't Ask\\" is the perfect song between \\"Cul De Sac\\" and \\"Duke's Travels\\". <br /> <br />The CD has illustrations that kind of remind you like a children's storybook.   This illustrations carry over into the liner notes and there is a different illustration on each page. The font of the lyrics also is kind of like storybook font.  All of the lyrics (with the exception of \\"Duke's Travels\\") are included along with the appropriate songwriting credits.   This is a great album and will appeal to old and new Genesis fans. I highly recommend this \\"masterpiece\\" to add your collection.

I think everybody should buy this CD, because these guys are very inspirational and they never let their fans down. They helped me and I can really relate to most of their songs.

B000001FA4|5.0|The 1985 release of \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" vaulted U2 into heavy video rotation and arena rock. With the production team of Brian Eno/Daniel Lanois at the helm, the group's sound shaped with new keyboard textures and lots of layering of The Edge's guitars. Some might say the disk was over-produced. We also get Bono's trademark emotive breathing on several tracks.<br /><br />I wavered between giving this 4 or 5 stars, so 4.5 might be the best assessment. The primary reason most people got this album was for the mega-popular anthem \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" with its Christ imagery (\\"one man betrayed with a kiss...\\") and Martin Luther King, Jr. theme (\\"early morning, April 4, shot rings out...\\") and memorable guitar melody. Great vocal performance by Bono and backing by The Edge (oh-oh-oh-oh). An instant classic.<br /><br />\\"Pride\\" aside, this disk has a number of excellent tracks. One of my all-time favorites is \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" and I especially like the lyric \\"faces ploughed like fields that once gave no resistance.\\" There's a strong Ireland theme here, and this is a great leadoff song. One drawback is that I think the mix is a little muddy.<br /><br />\\"Wire\\" is a high energy piece with a chunky bassline, great drums, and very cool guitars.<br /><br />\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" really brings out the guitar atmospherics, along with a string section, and another powerful vocal from Bono.<br /><br />\\"Promenade\\" is not a bad song, but it's really a sound-alike to many of the other songs, and not a particularly memorable memory.<br /><br />\\"4th of July\\" is a sonic instrumental introduction to \\"Bad\\", which is one of the best songs on the disk. Great simple guitar melody and vocal performance with the \\"I'm wide awake...and I'm sleeping\\" rise and fall dynamics. Perhaps some of Adam Clayton's best bass work to this point. Check this song out on the \\"Wide Awake in America\\" live EP. It's a beautiful tune.<br /><br />\\"Indian Summer Sky\\" is like \\"Promenade\\" in that it's not a bad song, but not as good as its sound-alike, \\"Wire.\\"<br /><br />\\"Elvis Presley and America\\" shows U2's growing love affair with Americana. It's a nice ballad.<br /><br />\\"MLK\\" is the true Martin Luther King, Jr. tribute, a gospel-like vocal over some light keyboard textures. It's a great under-stated performance by Bono and nice closer for the disk.<br /><br />The strengths by far lift up the few weaker tunes, and this disk is very listenable in its entirety.as its sound-alike, \\"Wire.\\" <br />\\"Elvis Presley and America\\" shows U2's growing love affair with Americana.

B00022LRXA|5.0|If you combined Roxy Music and Pink Floyd's instrumentals with vocals by a spaced-out Ringo Starr, you'd have Before And After Science. And oddly enough, it works.<br /><br />A heady mix of catchy melodies, whacked-out lyrics, and hauntingly beautiful musical passages make Eno's work here quite compelling. You'll find yourself humming at least three or four tunes, yet you won't skip past any tracks.<br /><br />I'm not an expert on synth stuff, but this stuff is fabulous, creating sounds you'd SWEAR came from a 23rd century orchestra. Recommended for lovers of keyboard excellence as well as those who enjoy well-crafted and quirky pop-rock. You'll REALLY dig it on headphones. :)
B000286RNY|1.0|Thanks goodness I rented this movie instead of buying it. It is so stupid. The characters over-exaggerate their emotions of sadness and joy, but not in a funny way. <br /> <br />A couple of times during the movie, the characters start to sing and dance, as if this were a musical. <br /> <br />Another reviewer made the mistake of comparing this to the movie Kung Pow. I own Kung Pow and I can honestly say that it is 100 times better than Shaolin Soccer. <br />
B00005V1Y0|3.0|At first glance, this movie is cheap idealistic shine, but it does have a deeper message.  \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived\\" is the films motto, and they advertise this at every opportunity. <br />The motto refers especially to Scott, a young dancer who wishes to dance his own moves, but on closer examination, aslo refers to many other characters (Doug, Fran, and Barry Fife.) <br />A must see if you liked cinderella, dirty dancing, or fame.
B00003CXDG|4.0|You can't knock Tom Cruise or John Woo for what's the matter with this film. Woo can take a little of the blame, but most of it has to go to the writers. The story is a little overplayed, and the movie has to much of a Bond feel to it at times. Despite that the action will blow you away and Cruise is the man. <br /> <br />Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is on vacation when it's cut short. He must recruit sexy thief Nyah(Newton) to help him in his next case. A dangerous virus Chimera has been stolen by an IMF employee. <br />That ex employee Sean Ambrosse(Scott) plans on selling the virus to the highest bidder. Now Hunt and Sean's ex-love Nyah must stop him before all is lost. <br /> <br />The plot is worn over and has been used way to much. It's pretty predictable the whole movie. That where the writing team has to be put to blame. You know exactly what's going to happen before it does, but what saves the film is it's star and director. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise is the man. He produced this movie with his production partner Paula Wagner. Like the first MI film he's all over this. His acting is good for what he's given to work with. He's a little to James Bond like at times, but you'll learn to look past that. His action sequences in the film are amazing. Tom Crusie did all his stunts in the film. Let me say again that Cruise did all his stunts in the movie. From the rock climbing to the bike riding they are amazing. I think it's great that a star with his kind of power will do it. He loves doing it to, and it really adds to the movie. <br /> <br />John Woo really does some great action in the picture. The chases and fight scenes are awesome. Everybody that sees this film will see something they've never seen before and that makes it fun. I loved the whole bird thing and was waiting to see the white dove which is one of his call signs. Woo does a good job of directing with what he's given to work with. <br /> <br />The DVD extras are pretty good. You have a 15 minute special behindthe making of the movie, and there's another five minute one about the stunts. Throw in a Metalica music video and you have above average extras. <br /> <br />I did enjoy this movie. I bought it and I wasn't to upset. The movie was a little to Jame Bond for me and the story was weak. Despite that the action makes it a four star film. If you loved the first one, you have to check this one out. If you love Tom Cruise this is another must. If you like Woo the same applies. If you want a good action flick then definetly pick it up. I did and I have no regrets.  <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|This CD is fantastic. I really do not understand the reasoning behind the Britney-Bashing on this review board. I just think that the people who have bashed her are jealous and that they seriously need to get over themselves and get a life.  <br /> <br />So what if some of the songs were written by someone else? What makes you think that all the artists besides Britney Spears-Federline didn't do the same thing?! I happen to love her music. I have always loved hearing all her songs on the radio and dancing in the car or living room to those catchy tunes, or singing those really seductive lyrics. I think she should be proud of herself for what she has done with her life and not worry about pleasing others.  <br /> <br />I have to say that today this CD has helped get me through a hard day at work. Listening to the music while creating a really hard Powerpoint presentation made it all better.  <br /> <br />Thank you Britney for giving your fans such a great 6-7 years of pop music and great memories.

B0001Z37HM|3.0|I've always been a fan of Robert Howard. I've enjoyed the Conan books that I've read and I love the first Conan movie. I can't figure out though is why Hollywood has butchered all his other characters in lame movies like Conan the Destroyer, Kull the Conqueror and Red Sonja.    Red Sonja(Nielson) is a warrior. Her family was murdered in front of her by the evil Queen Gedren(Bergman). She escaped from the fiery death that Gedren put her to, and now is training for her revenge against her.    Kalidor(Schwarzenegger) is a warrior in search of Sonja. While he was on his way to the great temple to watch the Great Talisman be destroyed he came upon Sonja's dying sister. He gets Sonja and takes her to her dying sibling. While the two sisters talk Sonja and Kalidor learn that Gedren has stolen the great talisman of power that could destroy the world. They have 13 days to destroy it, before it destroys them. The kicker to it all is that it can only be touched by woman.    Along the way they'll pick up a brat prince(Reyes) and his bumbling aid(Smith). The party must hurry to find the talisman and stop Gedren before it is all to late.    Brigette Nielson fills the role out physically, but that's about it. This woman acting is like watching paint dry. She's dull and boring. If it weren't for the fact she filled her costume out nicely, you'd probaly find yourself not wanting to watch it at all. The same thing can be said about Sandahl Bergman. She's a real stiff and is terrible too. It's not saying much when Arnold gives maybe the best acting performance of the film.    I did give the movie three stars though, and that would be for the pretty good sword play. Arnold and Brigette do plenty of it and are both pretty good at it. This movie followed the Conan movies so we knew Arnold could play the part. Brigette holds her own. The swordplay is more of that in the second Conan film. It's not all that bloody. This is one of the few films that I've ever seen where I wish they would'vebloodied it up more and possibly given it an R rating.    Ennio Morricone has written a beautiful score for the movie. In ways it's a shame because the movie is so bad. It has a quick catchy melody. This guy really is underrated as far as Hollywood composers. If your a fan of him, you might want to check the movie out.    When it comes down to it, this really is a pretty bad movie. The acting is horrible, and the swordplay isn't good enough to make up for it. The movie is relatively short, and quite frankly the movie isn't enough. They should have made it a little longer, gotten rid of the brat kid, and made it more violent to match the world they live in. Richard Fleischer is the easy target for this bad movie. I don't want to knock a guy for trying to make a family film, but don't do it and the expense of Robert Howards character.    This one is definetly a rental. If you loved the second Conan film, you might want to buy it. If your a hardcore fan of the actors in the film, you might want to check it out as well. I would definetly rent or borrow this one, before you buy it.
B00028HBKC|1.0|THE PASSION <br /> <br />0 Stars! <br /> <br />The Amazon synopsis is typical PR for this sadly, fearful and ugly film: Salute Mel Gibson for his bravery and integrity in putting his own cash and career on the line for his beliefs. It's fine to admire a determined director. Unfortunately, it's not a valid review of his film. <br /> <br />Despite the many objections to the Passion's sado-masochistic heavy-handedness, what is most reprehensible about the film is Gibson & Company's insistence on the reality - indeed, the divine nature - of its creation. However, there is very little biblical textual reality to Gibson's rendition, certainly very little of what we Catholics and Christians call \\"The Word.\\"  <br /> <br />The screenplay - by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald - takes rash liberties with all New Testament texts and adds its own sound bite relish. Much is owed to contemporary interpretation. Throughout, Jesus insists on his own divinity. Throughout, Mary is the dutiful mother figure cleaning up after her son, the Apostles are speechless weaklings, the Pharisees conniving Shylocks, the Romans giddy sadists. And throughout, an androgynous devil figure watches on with B-movie eyes of glee. No wonder Gibson did not originally want his film sullied with sub-titles - he didn't want his audience to see the obvious chinks in the armor of his allegedly \\"historically accurate\\" creation. <br /> <br />He needn't have feared. Contrary to the tidal wave of pre-opening press declaring its uniqueness (it's subititled!), the film panders to contemporary society's adolescent worship and glorification of violence - and, therefore, fits right in with today's Hollywood historical offerings such as Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\" and Russell Crowe's \\"Gladiator.\\" The abhorrent violence - again, so briefly sketched in the Gospels - is here relentless, splashed across the screen in slow motion, stop-time, close-up \\"Braveheart\\" lengths. Jesus is flogged like a tenderized sirloin. His pierced side produces a fountain that waters the crowd. (I checked my Home Medical Manual to verify that, indeed, human beings only have 10 pints of blood to spill). It's voyeurism at its absolute worst. <br /> <br />Finally, the saddest impression one takes from Gibson's film is that Jesus was tortured and died. Is that why his impact on mankind has been so great? There is little allusion to His teachings - a few token flashbacks of Jesus \\"on message\\" with his followers - but these moments lack any charismatic significance or volition to the story's plot. What finally resonates in Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is the fear and cruelty of man. And that's exactly what Jesus' life so beautifully transcended.  <br /> <br />You would never know that by viewing this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|Being a really obsessed and devoted Simple Plan fan, of course, after the release if \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls...\\", i COULD NOT wait until the new album \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" came out. When it finally came out in stores, i of course bought it the first day it came out. i actually MET them on the day it came out so that was really really awesome.(the guys are awesome, especially DAVID.) but anyways, once i listened to the damn cd, i was automatically HOOKED and IN LOVE with. i think the cd is an AWESOME new album and they couldnt have done it better. every song i hear, i can relate to and the sound of the album is really really good. i honestly think that this album is better then their debut. i think their debut album included more quantity then quality. but in their new album, it was more quality than quanity, which to my opinion isnt actually a bad thing. so what im trying to say is, Simple Plan's sophomore album is BEYOND AMAZING. this disc is definitely gonna stay in my cd player for a loooong time. =)

B00005Q4CS|3.0|...only in slow-motion, with lots of MTV-ish intercutting, speeded-up sequences, and a pulsating soundtrack as the carnage unfolds and the blood splatters the lens.<br /><br />Only here the carnage is not only physical but more unbearably, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and sexual.  In a nutshell: onrushing catastrophes at every level.<br /><br />This is one of those films, in the tradition of \\"Breaking the Waves,\\" where during the first 10 minutes you see very clearly that the main characters---quite sympathetic, unfortunately---are going to be on a fast-accelerating downhill slide for the rest of the movie.  Unlike similar films that chronicle a steady process of chemical-related self-destruction (\\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" come to mind), \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" will never be accused of \\"glamorizing\\" or \\"romanticizing\\" substance abuse.  Director Aranofsky seems to take special pains to capture every excruciating torture and suffering that his protagonists undergo---in fact, he even uses film and sound techniques to amplify it and shove our noses into it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is fairly bold as art, and probably quite accurate as social documentary, as an aesthetic work it simply is not very enjoyable to watch.  Both \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" had similarly bleak and hopeless storylines, yet managed to tell those stories in creative and interesting ways, rather than just straight-up, visually-enhanced journalistic docudrama...i.e. both were far more enjoyable because they were much more multi-dimensional, their characters were far better developed and far less predictable.  Leto, Connelly, Wayans, and Burstyn are all talented actors and appealing characters but they are barely developed beyond the black holes of their addictions and compulsions; instead they are presented as basically 4 hopeless and helpless lambs about to be tortured and eaten alive before our eyes in myriad ways.<br /><br />About the only truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.  She was the most interesting of the bunch by far, the other 3 leads are all cardboard characters we've seen a million times before, albeit played by very competent actors.<br /><br />This film could've been far more original, interesting, and insightful if it had simply focused on Burnstyn's character as a case study for mainstream America---lobotomized by TV, living isolated miserable lives in a dysfunctional community and culture, bloated by junk food used as pleasure substitutes, getting their fixes from the local pharmacy.<br /><br />Three stars for visual/aural stimulation but shallow and cliched storyline.ly truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|First I would like to start with the positive aspects of this version of \\"Emma\\".  The casting was almost 100% perfect.  Life has never been too hard on Emma, and Paltrow played her with a light-heartedned sweetness, untouched by bitter experience that I found appealing.  Emma may be misguided, but she is good-hearted.  That is how Paltrow played her. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Northam's portrayal of Knightley.  His thoughtfulness and kindness were expressed well.  His insight into the other characters was displayed.  However, the best aspect was the friendly interplay between Paltrow and Knightley.  They are believable as friends and as lovers. Their future marriage will be a happy one because not only are they attracted to one another; they truly esteem one another. <br /> <br />Juliet Stevenson was WONDERFUL as Mrs. Elton.  Shallow, snide and jealous she was.  I loved to hate her!  Delicious! <br /> <br />The lovely Greta Scacchi played my ideal of Mrs. Weston.  Cultured, feminine, she played Paltrow's friend rather than authority figure, which is how I always felt Austen pictured her.  While Emma always listens to Mrs. Weston, she does not always heed what she says. <br /> <br />Sophie Thompson must be one of the best character actresses to ever come out of the U.K.  Her Miss Bates is Perfection.  In those times, a woman needed to pretty, demure and married.  Poor Miss Bates is none of those things.  She feels herself to be a failure in life.  She is a social person by nature, but society denigrates her.  She is despised by the thing she loves.  Thompson played this very well. <br /> <br />Now for what I didn't agree with in the movie.  I'm sorry, but Harriet Smith was not portrayed accurately in this film version.  This was no fault of actress Colette.  The fault is in direction and script.  Harriet was a simpleton, yes, but she was sweet-natured and quite pretty.  Austen brings this out again and again.  After all, Emma thought that it was possible for her to marry Elton, Churchill and Knightley.  No one would have believed it possible in this Harriet Smith.  Robert Martin would not have married her either. <br /> <br />I also did not care for Polly Walker's version of Jane Fairfax.  Jane is a reserved person in extremely difficult circumstances, living in cramped conditions, facing an uncertain future, in love with man not her equal.  Walker simply played her like an untouchable goddess.  True, that is how Emma sees her at first; that is why she is jealous of her, but that is not how Jane really is.  Jane has feelings and is actually a romantic at heart.  Jane is frustrated and for that suffers headaches and ill health, like we all do when faced with prolonged stress.  That is how I think she should have been played.   <br /> <br />However, that does not mean I didn't like the movie.  I did.  I also liked \\"Jane Austen's Emma\\", but for different reasons.  Really, everyone must do themselves a favor and see them both!
6304696566|5.0|I have read many of the nearby reviews and nothing has been missed, the symbolism and all.  What I may be able to add is before this was available I recorded it off cable TV and pulled it out often to watch.  It is a great shame that this movie was not taken seriously when it first came out; the Duke rarely gave such an intense performance as he does here.  But Westerns were a dime a dozen and dismissed as kiddie fare despite the advent of the first \\"adult\\" Western \\"High Noon\\" 4 years earlier.  The photography is fantasatic, the performances are first rate and the dialogue, well, is mostly good.  Vera Miles (also in Wayne's \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\") plays the spinster patiently waiting for Ethan Edwards (Wayne) and her awkward-in-love beau (Jeffrey Hunter) to return from the search for the kidnapped girl while Ken Curtis (\\"Festus\\" of TV's \\"Gunsmoke\\" and former member of Sons of the Pioneers) romances her with his guitar.  Panhandle Pete Perkins, a Western veteran, is a dotty oldtimer.  Wayne perennial Ward Bond is on hand as a preacher and lawman/military man whose \\"authority\\" does not impress Wayne's character.  Patrick (Dad--got-me-the-job) Wayne turns in a good performance as a green cavalry man.  Harry Carey, Jr. is on hand in the search until a fit of rage drives him into the gunfire of the outlaw Indians.  Wayne pays tribute to Carey's father, a cowboy star in Hollywood's early days, in the end by resting his elbow in his hand (a Carey, Sr. trademark gesture) before turning his back on the warm family scene that he has made possible but is somehow foreign to him and wanders rather aimlessly away.  Oscar worthy.  You can get this flick in a set with other great Wayne movies if you like, but don't miss having THIS one.  Incidentally, early rocker Buddy Holly took the line that Ethan often spouts in the movie \\"that'll be the day\\" and made it into his successful rock song the following year. All good things.
0767020308|4.0|First I would like to start with the positive aspects of this version of \\"Jane Austen's Emma\\".  Beckinsale portrayed the misguided confidence turning to confusion of the Emma character beautifully.  She's absolutely sure she is right, and then cannot understand why events are not unfolding as she expected.  Wonderful portrayal!  Beckinsale did a wonderful job of putting Emma at \\"our\\" level.  By that, I mean that Emma is fallible, very fallible, but loveable all the same, much like each of us are from time to time.  I could identify with her and for that, I really, really liked her. <br /> <br />Samantha Morton was perfect as Harriet Smith.  She was pretty-faced, empty-headed without an ounce of malice in her.  And really, it's what makes her likeable.  Men fall in love with a pretty face every day.  No wonder, Emma could imagine her with Elton, Churchill and finally even Mr. Knightley.  Well done! <br /> <br />Olivia Williams did a fine portrayal of Jane Fairfax.  Jane is a reserved person in extremely difficult circumstances, living in cramped conditions, facing an uncertain future, in love with man not her equal.  Williams played her just that way.  She's beautiful, cultured and has feelings and is actually a romantic at heart. Jane is frustrated and for that suffers ill health, like we all do when faced with prolonged stress.  <br /> <br />Lucy Robinson was so wickedly malicious in her adaption of Mrs. Elton, that I was entranced.  Watching her was thoroughly entertaining!  Dominic Rowan and Lucy Robinson both did such a great teamwork as the \\"Elton Terrible Twosome\\" that I can only give praise.  (Chuckle, Chuckle...) <br /> <br />Prunella Scales is a marvelous character actress.  She played the oblivious though thoroughly well-intentioned spinster to a tee.  It was just the right mix of loveable irritation.  I am only sorry that it was not possible to fit in John Cleese somehow! <br /> <br />Now for what I didn't agree with in the movie.  Mark Strong is a wonderful actor but he came down like thunder in his portrayal of Knightley.  He seems to like everybody, but Emma!  Yes, he is her mentor; that is true; but how could he ever love someone he respected so little.  If I could have seen moments when he liked Emma, or forgave her her errors, I could have believed the final love scene.  I had the impression that he only proposed because he was forced to by the script.  A shame, because as I said, he's a fine actor and capable of making that scene heavenly, just like it is in the book.
B000053VAF|1.0|I'm not Catholic and perhaps I didn't \\"get it\\"; I wasn't offended by the excrement, etc. but the continuing sophmoric plot apparently intended to offend wore me down.  What a waste of talent (except, well, Affleck, stick to WRITING; you are SO wooden in your acting).  I hope all of those who were raised Catholic that were in the audience or in the movie FEEL better and their church-induced inhibitions have been wiped away after seeing or being in this flick.  The review of Shashank Tripathi (an Irish contemporary of mine) says it all well too.  It's only the second movie I ever walked out of (Drew Barrymore couldn't carry \\"Home Fries\\" all by herself; more wooden acting, not immature plotting, in that case).  They're lucky I didn't firebomb the theater on this one.  It was like the Worst of Saturday Night Live.  Grow up, Kevin.  You pseudo-intellectuals  givng this dreck 4 and 5 stars too.
1401301010|4.0|This was a deeply personal autobiography that dealt with all the highs and lows that Hollywood has to offer. Anthony chose to divulge more about himself and his inner demons, rather than right a tell-all about his band mates. A lot of this book deals with the relationship he had with his father when he was a young boy, and had chose to move to Hollywood, over a life in the mid-west with his mother, and what a profound effect it had on his life. He deals with struggling to have some assemblance of a normal life with his father (aka, \\"The Lord of the Sunset Strip\\"), while living in the midst of drug infestation, and just total debauchery as a kid. In the midst of so much chaos for someone so young he met Flea and Hillel, and started a band with them, that would improve his life financially, and in other ways make it worse.  It makes you really feel for him, and come to understand how someone coming from such an unstable background could come up with such deep and moving lyrics. He goes through a stream of beautiful women who offered him support through his addictions, only to kick them all to the curb. It makes you wonder if he could work to make a commitment to any one of these women if he would have more stablility in his life, rather than constantly seeking approval of the men around him as his support. It is inspiring to see someone who has been through so much, and be able to keep on. With everything he has been through, and his optimism seemingly on the rise, it does feel there are still a lot of resources left for plenty of new songwriting.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Anybody looking for a break from CGI and what passes for cinematic entertainment these days should check this one out.  Anybody who appreciates great ensemble writing and crisp dialogue will love \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\".  It is quite an achievement for a film that manages to engender sympathy for land parcel salesmen.  Director James Foley has gathered a great ensemble cast here and there is not a bad performance in the bunch.  Special citation has to go Alec Baldwin in his one scene as the motivational speaker that Mitch and Murray sent to the office to rally the troops.  If Oscars are given out for one scene then Baldwin should have received one.  Two lines that Baldwin delivers say it all; \\"Coffee is for closers\\" and \\"Hit the bricks\\".  Jack Lemmon as Shelley gives, what I feel, is the best performance of his career.  The desperation of his character is visceral.  Whether he is frantically making phone calls to dead-end leads or knocking on the door in the rain on a potential sale that goes nowhere you can deeply feel the pathos of his character.  On a real trivial note, for those who haven't seen this film, Lemmon's character was the inspiration for the Gil character on \\"The Simpsons\\".  Not to diminish the work done by the remainder of the cast (Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce) but I could go on infinatum as to how good this cast is.  This film almost makes you pause when you receive an unsolicited phone call from a salesman.  Let me emphasize, almost.
0440238609|5.0|I have always loved these books and would reccommend them to readers of all ages for not only the depth of plot but the masterful writing as well.   <br /> <br />This just in, though... \\"His dark materials\\" may be an allusion to Milton's Paradise Lost.  Check it out! <br /> <br />In Book II, Milton is describing the panorama of Hell as Satan looks upon it for the first time, and says,  <br />\\"Into this wild Abyss,/ the Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,/ of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,/ But all these in their pregnant causes mixt/ Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,/ Unless th'Almighty Maker them ordain/ His dark materials to create more Worlds,/ Into this wild Abyss the wary fiend/ Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,/ Pondering his voyage...\\" (Lines 910-919).   <br /> <br />This seems to be essentially saying that there will be unbalance, disorder, and chaos in the world (\\"causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight\\") unless God --- or perhaps some other sentient, omnipotent being, if we were to venture outside the Judeo-Christian tradition --- were to use \\"His dark materials\\" to create new worlds in which all problems were solved. <br /> <br />So... considering that quotation in the context of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, the books are even more impressive, not to mention thought-provoking. <br /> <br />Interesting.
B00004W510|5.0|I do not know what the previous review is talking about.  This is one of the best albums ever recorded.  It is one of the few where you can put it on and listen all the way through without a single bad song.  The unreleased songs available on this cd are worth the price itself, and this album should be picked up by anyone who knows what good music really is.  The album itself has hints of country and rock in it, and when broken down it is nothing more that simple, american roots music. Great listening no matter who you are.  \\"Rocin Chair\\" makes it worth the price of the cd alone.
B000089CJI|3.0|Saccharine pop.  With all due respecet to Amazon, I am not sure \\"breezy pop\\" quite gets us there.   It is roll-your-eyes-at-the-lyrics, uber-twee-synthpop. <br />And to be clear, I have no problem with pop, although, I like it best when it doesn't take itself too seriously.  And when it doesn't make me swallow fascile metaphors, song after bubbly song. <br /> <br />For my money, there are a lot of keyboard-based bands out there that carry the 80s synth torch with far more deference than Postal Service has.  If you would like hear a more substantive take on this, check out Mates of State.  Or, if you have heard them, and you want to hear what they would sound like as interpreted by a soundrack composer for a movie produced in 80s, then pick up this album. <br /> <br />I guess it is kinda charming in its exhuberance, and it is a well-executed idea, even if I don't cotton to it.  They make good keyboard sounds, and they are clearly talented musicians.  But assuming that indie is all about more challenging music or at least a more tangential take on rock/pop etc I am not sure (except for whatzis name from Death Cab for Cutie, who also flirt with being too pop for my exacting indie standards) how this qualifies as an indie. <br /> <br />Moral of the story: don't expect that.  Expect effervescent, sappy music, that if you have $12 and a soft spot for that kind of thing might make a fun disc to have in rotation.
B000059MEK|5.0|Now this is interesting. Apparently these guys have been famous for quite a while, yet somehow I'd never heard of them. All that was remedied recently though. When I heard that Leiji Matsumoto had created a full-length animated feature with stunning animation based on an ablum by Daft Punk, I just had to check it out. While my opinion of that excellent piece of animation is mixed (I just didn't dig the story or think most of it matched the songs all that well), it did something to me. It made me buy the album it was based on \\"Discovery\\". Wow.<br /><br />In this case, it seemed more like the music video was just a distraction than an extension of the music. When I first started listening to the album I thought it was okay, but as I progressed through it, listening to the songs in order, and then repeating some just to hear them one more time, I got HOOKED.<br /><br />It's hard to describe. I love electronic music and techno and all that sort of thing, but this is different. The voices and music are all really just toyed with by the musical artists in these songs. Everything is just a way to get you into a feeling, of a rhythm, or a beat. The more you hear the songs, they more they grow on you, the more you get into them, the more you like them, the more you listen to them.<br /><br />Take that song \\"One more time\\". That song is downright addictive! The beat is so infectious that I found I absolutely had to move to the song while I was listening to it. Ditto for the next three tracks. \\"Aerodynamic\\" is amazing because it uses electric guitar like a piano player uses his keyboard, not just for show, but to extend and play with a melody, finally turning it into a music-box version of itself before transforming into my favorite song on the album \\"Digital Love\\". I love that song. It's just so incredibly upbeat, happy, and beautiful. I love that song. A lot of people really love the next one, \\"Harder, better, faster, stronger\\". I didn't care for it at first, but it grows on you, to the point where I love it too now. My other favorite tracks include \\"Nightvision\\", \\"Superheroes\\" (why do I actually think of comic book superheroes when I hear that song?), and \\"Voyager\\".<br /><br />This may be an acquired taste, but it's definitely a taste I'm glad I acquired. If you dig electronic music in general you should check it out. Just keep an open mind. This more than just more of the same repetitive techno/electronica you've heard. This is beautiful, original, and unique music. Great stuff. Give it a try.ows on you, to the point where I love it too now.

B00003CXCT|1.0|The packaging falsely states that these are \\"the classic films\\".  The films being sold in this trilogy are updated versions of the \\"Special Editions\\" that were released in 1997, NOT the original theatrical classics as the packaging states.    Very deceiving and shameful marketing!
B0000VD04M|5.0|I only just saw this film for the first time just a few days ago (11/7/04). I've been a long time fan of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\\" but I never got the chance to see this film. So when it was finally being released on DVD (without being recalled), I was looking forward to it.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the rest of Ed Wood's films that much. But when this film showed Ed Wood (played by Johnny Depp)filming those other films, it wasn't boring. It was entertaining to just see how out of his mind Ed Wood really was - especially when he directs Bela Lugosi (played wonderfully by Martin Landau) to start pulling the Octopus' legs over himself, making it supposedly look like he is being attacked by it. Of course it looks ridiculous, and that's what's great about it.<br /><br />I also liked how this film was not only Ed Wood's life story, but also Bela Lugosi's. I'm a big fan of him too, and it was cool to see the friendship between Wood and Lugosi develop and to see that Ed Wood generally cared for him.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they did more of was the Plan 9 stuff. It kind of seemed like they took their time with 3/4 of the movie, and sort of rushed through the point in Ed Wood's life where he films Plan 9. To me, while they did an excellent job at recreating what the original film looked like, I wish they would've given us more because Plan 9 was Ed Wood's most remembered film. Perhaps if they took out some of the plot that focuses on Ed Wood's fetish with woman's clothing, they'd have more room for the story of how Plan 9 came to be.<br /><br />I loved the atmosphere created in this film. It totally reflected the time period that Ed Wood's films came out in. And they really got the whole \\"feel\\" of his films down perfectly when we saw him filming them in the movie. And of course the fact that the whole movie was filmed in black and white helps a great deal.<br /><br />The movie was very entertaining overall. I think any audience can enjoy it.

B00028HBKM|1.0|This film is melodramatic garbage, and I must wonder why more Christian folks weren't up in arms over the film. Apart from the beautiful languages spoken throughout the course of the film, there's very little in terms of merit here. I understand the point intended by displaying the slow physical death of Jesus is to make us feel compassion, but the flaying and beating go on for so long as to desensitize the viewer to the graphic violence. Instead of emotion or depth, we're treated to lots of make-up effects and gallons upon gallons of stage blood. Criticism that the only \\"content\\" of the film comes from the flashbacks is misguided -these scenes play out as a \\"best-of-Jesus\\" montage that do little more than alter the pace of the film. The intended point was probably to make up for the complete lack of character development or any sort of insight, but the actual function is that it breaks up long and (at least initially) unsettling scenes so that we don't grow bored as the inevitable approaches. All of the acting here is hollow, wooden fare save for the woman playing Mary. This is all further trivialized by the completely laughable stabs at frightening the viewers: demon children chasing down Judas, the withered \\"devil baby\\", and then, that most offensive sequence of all, the three-quarters-perspective pull back of Satan crying out \\"NOOOOOOO!!!!\\" from Hell, which is apparently some place comprised of badly rendered CGI by multimedia students at the corporate \\"art\\" school of your choice. As a non-Christian, I'm outraged that this film got positive reviews. I've discussed much of this with Christian friends of mine, and several opted to not see this film on my advice; the one who did phoned me after watching and agreed with me. If you believe in Jesus, or agree with some of the ideals presented in the New Testament, this film will raise hackles on your back. It's sensationalistic, Hollywood-style crap masquerading as a purportedly moving indie film. Avoid at all costs.

B00007G207|1.0|I must add my voice to others who were disappointed by the \\"Director's Cut\\".  Having been so impressed by Tornatore's film the first time, I trusted that he would make it even better.  This is not the case.  Our favorite little boy, when grown up, is still obsessed with his first love, but so much so that one wishes to slap some sense into him.  While trying not to give too much away, watching this middle-aged, grey haired man struggle with purely adolescent issues is nothing short of pathetic.  In the case of this movie, less is indeed more.  Still buy the DVD if you want -- the original version is there, too, on the flip side.  With the original version, you have sweet sentiment and artistic subtlety.  With the new version, you have over-the-top sentiment and a tiring soap opera.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler's latest solo effort does not disappoint, unless you are one of the hard-core Dire Straits fan who will never be happy until Knopfler returns to hard-driving rock. (And we amazon shoppers have seen our share of those reviewers...) This album is not Dire Straits. What it is, however, is story-telling at its finest, which has always been one of Knopfler's strong points.  Knopfler is one of the best lyricists in music today, and \\"Shangri La\\" shows this nearly as well as \\"Sailing to Philadelphia,\\" which remains in my opinion the strongest of Knopfler's solo works.  I do not mean to slight the music on this album by emphasizing the lyrics, however; Knopfler will always be one of the greatest guitarists, period, with a unique style and sound that is so characteristic that I knew immediately there was a new Knopfler album out when I heard just a snippet of a song played on the local public radio station. Nobody else makes a guitar sound the way Knopfler does.<br /><br />But nobody writes songs the way Knopfler does, as well, and every one of his albums--both solo efforts and with Dire Straits--contains quiet gems that tackle topics that are rarely the subject of popular music.  Take, for example, the track \\"Boom, Like That,\\" which is, in my opinion, the best song on this album. Musically it is the catchiest of the bunch, and the one most likely to make a dent in the charts.  But it's not until you concentrate on the lyrics that you realize it is also biting social commentary, describing Ray Kroc's buyout of the McDonald's name and his chutzpah in deciding to force the brothers out of business later on by opening a McDonald's across the street from their subsequent  restaurant.  When Knopfler sings \\"It's dog eat dog/ rat eat rat/ Kroc-style, boom, like that\\" it's an indictment not just of Ray Kroc but the entire remorseless, survival-of-the-fittest nature of unfettered capitalism.<br /><br />The other highlight on the album is the title track, a prototypical soft and crooning Knopfler love song.  As you listen to its chorus, \\"This is all the heaven we've got/ right here where we are/ in our Shangri La,\\" the listener realizes that as long as there is a Mark Knopfler on earth to give us music of such depth and beauty, it's really all the heaven we need.al soft and crooning Knopfler love song.

B00008DDRX|5.0|This is the ultimate racing movie! Forget garbage like \\"Days of Thunder\\" and \\"Driven\\", this is the real deal. You can tell Steve's passion for racing in this movie. Of course once you've seen it, you'll have to read \\"A French Kiss With Death\\" which tells the tale of the making of \\"Le Mans\\" and the race itself.
B00005AQGH|5.0|If you are wondering which 2Pac albums you should buy this one should be near the top of your list.  I have all of 2Pac's albums (including sountracks & compilations) and I have to say that this album had 2Pac at his best.<br /><br />This album was released less than two months after 2Pac was killed & was recorded in seven days (hence the title \\"The 7 Day Theory\\").  This album contains twelve tracks.  Many rap fans might think this to be a small number of tracks for a rap album but 2Pac made every single track on this album to the best of his abilities.<br /><br />The first track is called Bomb First (My Second Reply) and is pretty much an unofficial part 2 to Hit Em Up.  Of course this track isn't quite as explicit as Hit Em Up but it gets it's point across well:  Death to Bad Boy Records.  This is a pretty good track but definitely not what I'd call a highlight track on this album.<br /><br />The next track is titled Hail Mary and is one of the creepiest 2Pac tracks that I have ever heard.  One of the lines 2Pac spits on this song is \\"when you turn out the lights I'll be there in the dark, thuggin eternal through my heart\\".  The way he raps this song gives me the chills every time I hear it.  This is definitely a highlight of the album!<br /><br />Track three is a track titled Toss It Up and is a party track that has K-Ci & JoJo hooking back up with 2Pac.  The funny thing about this track is that the first half is obviously about sex but on the second half of the track 2Pac starts dissing Dr. Dre.  I know that this is because Dr. Dre supposidly stole the original beat for Toss It Up and gave it to Blackstreet (it's the track titled No Diggity).  Although 2Pac's verbal assault on Dr. Dre in this song wouldn't make sense to \\"casual\\" 2Pac fans this is still a very good track and another Highlight of the album.<br /><br />Track four is one of my personal favorites.  It's To Live & Die In LA.  2Pac shows us his deep passion for LA and it's people and this track does make me wish I could see LA.  This is a fun track and is yet another champion track to this album.  At the end you'll hear yet another Dre Diss.  At the end of the track 2Pac says \\"California Love part motherf***in' 2 without [...] @$$ Dre\\".<br /><br />The next three tracks are titled Blasphemy, Life Of An Outlaw, & Just Like Daddy.  Many 2Pac fans love these tracks and while I did find them to be good they are not highlight tracks.  These are one's that I occasionally skip over.<br /><br />Track 8 is titled Krazy & is a really great 2Pac track.  It features Bad Azz & is one of the sadder songs on this album.  It's truely 2Pac speaking from the heart on this one.  This is a highlight track & one that I'm sure will show up on a 2Pac Greatest Hits part 2 CD if one ever gets created.<br /><br />White Man'z World is a track that I'm split about.  I really love the production and 2Pac's verses but the subject matter is a bit touchy.  Fans of Brenda's Got A Baby & Keep Ya Head Up will be satisfied with this track.  People who are tired of \\"blame whitey for all of your problems\\" songs will probably find this track to be one of the worst on the album.  But I feel that everyone has a right to their opinions so I'll say that while this track is good it's not a highlight track.<br /><br />Track 10 is titled Me & My Girlfriend and is a ballad of 2Pac's love for his gun.  This is a great great track and should be hailed as one of 2Pac's all time best.  This is another one that would make in on Greatest Hits part 2 album.  Excellent track!<br /><br />The last two tracks of this album are titled Hold Ya Head & Against All Odds.  Hold Ya Head is a pretty good track that holds it own on this album.  It's a song done in the same style as Brenda's Got a Baby or Keep Ya Head Up.  Against All Odds is a great ruthless track.  2Pac names names of specifically who he thinks shot him back in 1994 on this track.  It's a hard track that will make you want to ride.<br /><br />Overall this is a great album.  This album along with All Eyez On Me & Me Against The World is one of 2Pac's best albums.  This is one that should not be missed.<br /><br />P.S.  Hardcore 2Pac fans should know that the new 2Pac Album tentatively titled Loyal 2 The Game will be hitting stores by December of 2004!  Eminem served as Co-Executive Producer on this album so those of you who liked the tracks he produced on the Tupac: Resurrection Soundtrack are in for a treat!s best albums.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|This is a genuinely exciting album of 14 well-known Guns 'N Roses tracks from the band's glory years of 1987-93. November Rain is the best-ever epic rock ballad of its type - magnificent electric guitar work and grand strings. Breakthrough track Sweet Child O' Mine still sounds good today. Their covers of Live And Let Die and Sympathy For The Devil are also good, while hard-edged rock music like 1991 hit You Could Be Mine showed how powerful this band was. I like the way they were able to do slow, acoustic stuff too (like Patience), which showed that they were good musicians. I was pumped up after playing my new copy of this scorching Greatest Hits set recently - an effect which a lot of lesser rock bands don't achieve with their music.  <br /> <br />4 stars from me.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|This is a good collection of Shania's hits. 17 hits, and 3 new songs. Of course there's a few hits left out such as \\"You've Got A Way\\", but it's a fairly consistent collection. Hits include \\"Any Man Of Mine\\", \\"If You're Not In It For Love (I'm Outta Here)\\", \\"The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)\\", \\"Up!\\", \\"Forever and For Always\\", \\"Love Gets Me Everytime\\", \\"You're Still The One\\" and many more. \\"Party for Two\\" is the lead single for the album, there is a country version with Billy Currington and a pop one with Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray. \\"Don't\\" is a very intimate ballad, and \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is the most country thing Shania has done in quite a while. A must have collection!
B000002G23|5.0|Message In A Box is exactly how every record company should issue single-artist/band anthologies on disc - put in everything that's official. Why hold anything back in the vaults that's already been officially released on vinyl or CD. I think this is a superb set - the music is really good, there are no irksome omissions, the booklet inside is well-written , and the box itself is elegant and well-designed. Box sets actually work better when they aren't boxes but slimline folders like this one. So, full marks to the record company for this set!!! <br /> <br />I bought my copy of this in Boston in June for US$39 and was very pleased to finally hear all the Police album tracks and B-sides that I'd never heard before. Their early stuff was really energised and hard-edged and surprised me a bit ( in a good way) . I like the trademark Police sound and the way that this band progressed from a fairly spare 3-piece group to develop a more sophisticated musical style as their career progressed.  <br /> <br />Best tracks in my opinion: Wrapped Around Your Finger, So Lonely, De Do Do Do De Da Da Da, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Driven To Tears, I Burn For You, Message In A Bottle and of course Every Breath You Take. <br /> <br />A great band.
0064407667|5.0|I wish some of the lower-star reviewers would stop analyzing this series so much and stop complaining about the violence and how bad all the adults in the story are. First of all, in some books written for children, many times some of the adult characters are written as either really stupid or else very mean or evil. The Harry Potter books are a prime example.  Both the Harry Potter series and the Lemony Snickett series are tales of good versus evil. Oftentimes there is an exaggeration of the bad characters. It just makes for a more interesting story.  I found The Bad Beginning to be fascinating and captivating from the first chapter. I can't wait to read the next book and all the ones after that. I'm hooked on the series and will be seeing the movie for sure.  I'm glad this is yet another series of books that will lure in kids of all ages, and like the Harry Potter books, will instill  young readers with an interest in reading.I liked how the Lemony Snicket books are short and very fast-paced. There was not a boring moment in the book. Wish i could say the same for Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, which i found tedious as hell to read.  I read  the whole first Lemony book in under a few hours and i liked the author's literary style and his technique of explaining the meaning of some of the vocabulary words as the story goes along. This alone, will increase a young-person's vocabulary. Though they may not use those particular words in everyday conversation, when they see them again in print sometime in the future, they will know the meanings. I think this series of books will be as popular as Harry Potter, and in some ways even more so. Highly recommended. As for the  violence in the book, some of it may be a bit scary for very young children under 9, but any child who has watched today's tv shows won't be bothered by what happens in the story. If anything, it just heightens the events and makes it all more fascinating and fun. And anyway, if you're bothered with your kids reading this series, there IS a warning from Lemony Snicket himself that this story is not happy at all and doesn't have a happy ending.h your kids reading this series, there IS a warning from Lemony Snicket himself that this story is not happy at all and doesn't have a happy ending.
B000000WG3|5.0|In 1985, Gary went back to Ireland and played(for the first time since his teenage years) in Belfast. On Wild Frontier, his first studio album after that trip, Gary revisits his homeland in songs. This album was clearly born from his trip back home as many of the songs are about Ireland and even the music itself is steeped in his celtic roots. <br />The title track was originally intended to be sung by Phil Lynott(who also sang on two tracks on Gary's previous album, Run For Cover) but his untimely passing prevented that. The album itself is dedicated to Phil's memory and I think he would have loved the musical stories that are contained here. <br /> <br />The songs Over The Hills And Far Away and Thunder Rising are as much short stories as they are songs. They are stories of Ireland present(Over The Hills) and past(Thunder). The title track is a beautiful song obviously born from his love of his homeland. The Loner is an outstanding instrumental that really showcases Gary's style of play. <br />The guitar playing this album is incredible. It is passionate and, at times, understated. It is also worth noting that Gary has rarely sounded as at home on the vocals as he does here. I think this albums shows his maturity as a singer as well as a guitarist. <br />Wild Frontier is an essential Gary Moore album that should be in the collection of any fan of his.

B000244FDW|5.0|I have longed for this to be available on DVD and was afraid that the A & E version would preclude this re-release. Happily, given the bargain rate, Austen fans can enjoy both versions. While I must say I adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, I really prefer the rest of this cast to that of the A & E editon. Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett to me; the other actress playing EB was too \\"modern.\\" (In fact, she reminded me of a flapper that landed in the wrong period piece; too much smirking and not enough wit for Our Miss Bennett.) And Lady Catherine deBurghe--this actress really makes her terribly believable (and therefore, Eliza much more courageous for standing up to her), whereas in the A & E version she's a frail old lady one feels rather sorry for (and therefore Eliza gains no points for taking her down a peg or two). I wish we had a computer technology to put this cast into the lush historic settings of the A & E version, but barring that, buy both!
0790749815|5.0|This has more 50's ambience than half a dozen regular '50's films combined. I love it a lot but the Mt. Rushmore sequence just cannot be as breathtaking once you know the result during a second viewing of it. It is long but very satisfying. Eva Marie Saint is a beauty and great, method actress. She gives her role an extra strong air of authenticity. Outside of her I do not approve of methood actresses or method actors.
B000001ESF|5.0|First off, I would just like to say that this is a great record. I am actually listening to it as I write this.  Rush is one of the greatest \\"Progressive\\" Rock bands out there.  <br /> <br />That being said I would like to comment on a few of the negative post, not to bash the poster but to help others looking at this.  <br /> <br />\\"Slick Dick\\" do you know when this record came out? 1976.  This was not the era of Slayer, Megadeth or Metallica. It was also before \\"new-wave\\" as you called them.  Also Rush was an influence of Metallica's, especially with Cliff. <br /> <br />\\"Proud Led Head\\" I love Zep too. One of the greatest bands ever, but to compare Led to Rush would be comparing Apples to Oranges. Led was a \\"Hard Rock\\" band with its roots in blues.  Rush was a \\"Progressive Rock\\" band with more of technical musical background with some influences from Zeppelin.  Both very talented bands, just very different styles.  <br /> <br />Lastly, \\"J. McAndrew\\" your drug comments baffle me.  You site that \\"all the kids who were doing well\\" were listening to jazz, and Rush fans are all \\"drug heads.\\" I'll admit that in the 70's there was a lot of drug use going on, everyone was doing it....  But to say the \\"Jazz group\\" had nothing to do with that you are wrong.  Are you saying that Miles Davis wasn't doing drugs? Or even the people that listened to him weren't?  Drugs have been in jazz since the beginning of the jazz area.  Cab Calloway sang about the \\"Reefer man\\", even Satchmo smoked marijuana.  There are many more references, too many to list here. <br /> <br />Well I'm sure that you are sick of reading this by now,  that is if you are still reading...  I just hope that this will help clear up a few things for people.  Thanks for your time.

I bought this album hoping for some upbeat jazz numbers. The first time I listened to it I was a little disappointed.

It really doesn't matter what the genre is.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Whether you love her or hate her, idolize her or resent her, it is undeniable that Miss Britney Spears has made an enormous impact in pop culture-and our society in general (whether that impact be negative or positive is arguable). Anyways, some say it's too early, but I think Britney has more than enough hits to release a Best Of album. I just want to make one thing clear: I really, REALLY do not like Britney Spears as a person. I have lost all respect for her. But you know what? Yes, as much as it may make some of you cringe, I buy music for catchy beats, danceable tunes, and just....enjoyable music. I don't like Britney Spears, I think her image is going down the toilet, and I'm not impressed with her voice. But her music is catchy and infectious as hell-a succulent guilty pleasure. Anyways, here's a review of each song:  <br /> <br />MY PREROGATIVE- This song really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way the first time I heard it. Like \\"Slave\\" and \\"Boys,\\" it is crackling electrofunk that doesn't suit Britney. And yet...lately, it's starting to grow on me. You have to listen to it a few times. Believe it or not, though, it is far poppier than the original, proving that Britney is staying true to her bubblegum roots to the very end. The chorus will likely get stuck in your head-whether you like it or not. A nice song to sing along to when you're pissed off. (3/5)   <br /> <br />TOXIC- In my personal opinion, this is her best song of all time. The beat is infectious, the chorus is insanely catchy, and the background effects are awesome. Such a cool song. I'm getting a *tad* tired of it because I've heard it a few too many times, but when you hear it for the first time it's mind-blowing. I know a lot of Britney-haters who love this. (5/5)  <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U- I've always thought this one was a tad overrated, but nice, funky little club beat. It's a bit boring. The beginning sounds raw. But once the chorus gets going, it's kind of cool. (4/5)  <br /> <br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN- Ah, a delicious teen pop pleasure. Very catchy chorus, background effects that are easy on the ears and yet danceable and catchy. (5/5)  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC- Like this one, but don't really adore it. It's pretty cool-very, very unique. Unlike anything she's ever done. A good street/club track. (4/5)  <br /> <br />STRONGER- I think this is her second-best song of all time. Love the chorus. I sort of like the lyrics, too-her only independent song. But all of her lyrics are airy in some form or way. Anyways, great song to dance to. (5/5)  <br /> <br />EVERYTIME- This is the only ballad by her that I truly enjoy. Sweet piano melody. A sad song, I suppose, but it's really hard to take any of her 'emotions' seriously. But a masterfully crafted ballad tune, nonetheless. (5/5) <br /> <br />...BABY ONE MORE TIME- This is THE Britney Spears song. This song MADE her and put her where she is today. But I don't think this is her best song. Far from it, in fact. Quite catchy, though. But I think I've heard it a few too many times. It's getting old. (4/5) <br /> <br />(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY [THE STOP REMIX!]- The original version of \\"Crazy\\" was somewhat catchy, but nothing incredibly special. It sounded a bit dull and raw. The Stop! Remix, on the other hand, is downright explosive and in my opinion is better than \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" The beat is far more hard-hitting, and it motivates you to get up and dance far sooner than the original. (5/5)  <br /> <br />BOYS [CO-ED REMIX] FEATURING PHARRELL WILLIAMS- Basically, a rip of of Janet Jackson's \\"Nasty\\" and Britney's own \\"I'm A Slave 4 U.\\" This song is nothing special. And this Pharrell guy can't sing at all. Britney puts him to shame vocally, and that is just sad. The remix is better than the original, but this still....really isn't very good. (2/5)  <br /> <br />SOMETIMES- I've really never liked this song. Goes beyond bubblegum and leans more towards childish. She doesn't have the voice for ballads. She shouldn't do them. (1/5)  <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED-THE DARKCHILD REMIX [RADIO EDIT]- \\"Overprotected\\" is an awesome song-one of my favorites by Britney. This remix, however, is massively overrated. I don't think it's better than the original. They should have included the original version. The backing track is too repetitive. But the undeniably catchy beat shines through. (3/5)  <br /> <br />LUCKY- For some reason, I was just fascinated by this song when it first came out. But now that I have the whole thing on a CD, it's nothing spectacular. However, the beat is quite catchy and I still like it. An old-fashioned beat. The third-best song on her second album. (5/5)  <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS- This was never a hit. They tried to make a video out of it (and I don't know why, because In The Zone has way better to offer), but as I'm *SURE* you all know, she injured herself in the process. A tad repetitive. I love the breakdown in the middle, I have to admit. (4/5)      <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN- As I said before, I don't like her ballads. And I've really never liked this song. It's stupid. (1/5)  <br /> <br />I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN) and DO SOMETHIN'- Neither one is that great. Both could be qualified as filler. Generic electrofunk beats, yet again reminiscent of the 'new' Britney. She should really stick to pop. That's all she can do. (Score for both): (1/5)  <br /> <br />OVERALL SCORE: 57/85  <br /> <br />There are a few hits I'm not too impressed with dragging down the score, but the good ones are REALLY good, and make this ultimately a worthwhile buy. A must-have for Britney fanatics, and this is THE CD to get if you're a casual fan, because it's Britney at her very best-free of the other albums' filler. All of my favorite songs by her are here, but I have to admit I'm surprised \\"Born To Make You Happy,\\" \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" are missing. I'm not too thrilled with any of them (\\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" is atrocious, quite possibly her worst song ever), but they were bigger hits than some of the other tracks here. And I'm upset that the original version of \\"Overprotected\\" wasn't included. But even without those, this is a great CD with great music, and these are indeed Britney's Greatest Hits.    <br /> <br />
B000286RKW|5.0|\\"Goodfellas\\" is one of those movies I patiently waited for to get a special edition. There were many times I was close to buying the crappy, bare-bones version that was out in stores, but I never gave in. And now I am glad I didn't. <br /> <br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is the story of Henry Hill. If you don't know by now, Hill used to work for the mafia. He then ratted out his friends and went into the witness protection program. This movie is his story from his days as a kid up 'till his last days as a gangster. I think the story is very engaging and it's amazing to see how these people live their lives on a daily basis. <br /> <br />I just love watching this movie. It's as simple as that. It's got so many scenes that I can recite to my friends. It's a funny movie. It's got action. I mean if I was going to conjure the perfect mob movie in my head, this is what I would've ended up with. And when I say best \\"mob movie\\" ever made, I am not really comparing this to \\"The Godfather\\", as I think they are two completely different types of movies. <br /> <br />Ray Liotta is brilliant here as Henry Hill. Liotta wasn't a big name at the time of this movie, but he was the perfect choice. And do I even have to mention that Robert DeNiro was fantastic? He plays the character of Jimmy Conway perfectly. Although Liotta & DeNiro were great, Joe Pesci is the one who steals the show here. Pesci plays the crazy, psychotic, out of control (but hilarious) mobster. He has most of the funny lines in the movie, and his character just eats up every scene he is in. No matter who he is acting with. Paul Sorvino plays the boss named \\"Paulie\\". He hardly ever speaks in the movie, but Sorvino did that intentionally. He is so good of an actor, just his looks and glares reflect what he is trying to say. Lorraine Bracco plays Henry Hill's wife and you can definately see why they picked her for \\"The Sopranos\\". I loved her here and it was another great casting choice. <br /> <br />I remember back when I saw thismovie, I really didn't know who Martin Scorcese was. Obviously I do now, but while watching this movie you can really see what an amazing filmmaker he is. Even other popular directors today say the same thing. I hope he takes the time to give 'Raging Bull' & 'Casino' the same type of DVD treatment her gave 'Goodfellas'. Those two movies definately deserve it, as well. <br /> <br />Special Features: There are 2 seperate commentary tracks. One is with Scorcese and some of the cast & crew. The other is with Henry Hill & Edward McDonald, a former FBI agent. Both are pretty decent tracks. On disc 2, you get a very good documentary on the making of the film. Then there is a featurette interviewing other well-known directors who talk about the influence this movie had on them and their careers. Then you get a featurette talking about the \\"less than glamorous side of working for the mob\\". Finally, you get storyboard-to-screen comparisons & a trailer. Overall, this is a very good set of features. I just wish they hadn't made us wait that long for them.
6304806418|5.0|I just purchased this DVD and I remembered instantly why I enjoyed this film so much when it came out.  I would just like to answer some of the critiques listed here. <br /> <br />1)  The character of Ch was always meant to be a nemesis to Evita, but not the real character as such . In the stage production that I saw, it was a man with the typical beret and machine gun singing to the side of the action.  It would have been ridiculous and historically inaccurate to portray Ch as such in the movie version.  Ch Guevara was still a medical student when Eva died.  I think it is very effective to blend Ch into various characters because it represents the silent and not so silent opposition to the Pern Revolution.  The only time the two characters meet for real interaction is when Evita is having delusions.  The song argued in that moment perfectly clashes Ch's \\"idealism\\" with Evita's \\"realism.\\"  Ch is always there in some form, yet Evita is oblivious to his presence, brushes him off with a quick lyric or purposely chooses to ignore him.  This adds a metaphysical dimension to the plot as if Evita were increasingly self-justifying her growing power as a simple tool to help the impoverished.  <br />  <br />2)  The soundtrack to the movie is not an operatic stage version but the songs are presented using the operatic techniques of repetition.  This was done on purpose, not due to a lack of creativity.   <br /> <br />3)  When I saw this off off broadway, the people that were with me were straining to understand the singing beside the fact that they had no idea about the history of post WWII Argentina.  I don't think they enjoyed it as much as they wanted to let on.   <br /> <br />4)  Madonna sings very well and is completely understood.  I had the argument with some friends that heard the soundtrack and thought she was singing off key on the last couple of tracks...  Ummm.  Not really.  She was about ready to pass away in those scenes which in the movie are close-ups.It would have been ridiculous to have anyone belt out the lyrics in such an intimate moment before passing on.  It sounds like she is dying, because she is...   <br /> <br />5)  The cinematography is simply amazing.  The funeral scene at the very beginning was incredible as well as the scene where Eva puts her foundation to work.  Pictures of the real Evita meeting the Pope and others perfectly match the costumes used in the movie. <br /> <br />6)  For me, the main focus of the movie is the strategy of propaganda and how it can dominate reason.  The mystery lies in how much of the persuasion was authentically from the heart of the Perns and how much of it was naked manipulation.  The movie captures both aspects and yet leaves them unanswered...Much like the historical analysis of Eva Pern. <br /> <br />This movie is an awesome production ...
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Despite the obvious influences shining through on this c.d, the songs are instant hits and are classics in their own right.  Sonata is not for everyone but those who enjoy melodic, powerful and fast metal should really check these guys out!   Ecliptica is raw, fast and Kakko really belts out the vocals. Through time and experience the band have now tended towards a more operatic approach 'its blatant when comparing this c.d to Reckoning night' <br /> <br />Dragonforce, Redwine and Lost Horizon fans, this c.d ought to please
B00005JNEI|1.0|The review I was looking for was on the first page a week ago. <br />Out of all the reviewers, He was a soldier at present serving in Iraq. That review moved me more than any out of the 711 I searched through to find it. It was so moving that I just wanted to write and say as for all the rest all I could think is that it is just a movie and if it offended one person who puts his life on the line for our country and flat tells you why and the reasons were very good and his information not long and drawn out but more informative than all the opinions I read and all I wished was I could of found that one review which moved me so much because he gave some facts from the frontline and he loved his country and is trying to do his job and that he was offended by this movie and I think that said it all. So because the movie has made it's way into my home and not by me because I was not even going to watch it because of the pain it caused just that one person putting his life on the line and believing in the cause I can only add how sorry I am that you are there and gave some facts that I completely  believed more than this unbelievable amount of reviews without facts and only opinions. I would just like to say I enjoyed your review and still have not saw the movie but would like to say I am sorry that you were offended and pray you are well and make it back home to the America you love!!!! God Bless You. Thanks for the facts. Be Safe. God Bless America and God Bless You for what you are doing and because you love your country. I believe in you and not some stupid movie. <br />And I am a movie lover. But it seems to me this one is not going to be a movie that i will find entertaining and there are so many that are very entertaining. I love art , but not just total clueless bashing.I hope Bush gets us out of Iraq and you are a true american whom touched my soul and I hope all these other reviewers read your review which was to the point and the best review I read. It is verylate or early depending on how you look at 5:15am and I am only sorry I could not find your review but maybe now that I have let others know where you are they may have the chance to read it. It seems these days they will pay the most money for the lowest type of charaters. It is really shocking what vulgur types get paid. I still have not seen the movie but it is so shocking these days what type famous people get paid millions to be vulgur. I bet I do not have to explain that. But instead maybe they should be paying more for our military men like you who truly love your country. Been up all night and am a bit cranky but just wanted to hopefully get others to read your review. Maybe even Mr Moore?? <br />When I first read your review it was on the first 3 or 4 pages. <br />I have not been able to find it up to the 700's. I only mentioned the fact about the millions paid to vulgur types because maybe and I cannot be positive on this because I have not seen this movie but it sounds like a bunch of speculation bashing of the president. I do not like movies that are maybe in bad taste and less artistic. From the reviews it sounds more like personal opinions. Mean Spirited. But when it offends the very people who are defending our country and believe in the cause it can't be a good thing. Give me a good Mel Gibson movie,Give me good drama, Give me action, adventure, comedy, but do not give me mean spirited movies.Honestly, In fact you would have to tell me what else this man has directed. I love movies. I  am a movie buff and I love some really out there stuff. It was your review that made me think that this is no\\" American Beauty\\"! Who needs all this negativity.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this film.  The book was my favorite of the series to date, but the movie deviated too far from the book.  Dumbledore's personality was completely different, which doesn't make sense in the continuity of the series.  I don't know why the new director thought it necessary to change the grounds  of Hogwarts.  And they all but left Maggie Smith out, playing Professor McGonagill. So much was eliminated concerning the history of Harry's father and his three closest friends which was supposed to have set the stage for the sequels.  I heard J.K. Rowling say in an interview that she really liked this movie and the changes the director made.  I can't imagine why, since there was so much difference between the two, often in key areas.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Take all of Elliott's albums, from Roman Candle through Figure 8 and even some Heatmiser, weave them together, and you get From a Basement on the Hill.  The songs here sting with the pain of Elliott's early 4-track work and resonate with the openness of his later studio explorations, often within a single tune such as Twilight.  Every song is genius - Elliott had few peers in song-writing talent - but one in particular wrenches my heart.  If you've ever backslid, if you've ever returned to that lover or drug one last time, you'll identify with Fond Farewell: \\"This is not my life/it's just a fond farewell to a friend\\".  Sung over a resolute strum (think Sister Golden Hair by America), Elliott's turns of phrase - e.g. \\"dying man in a living room\\" - are piercing.  Overall the record is a lovely ride, with captivating shifts from soft (Last Hour) to raucous (Shooting Star) interspersed with mesmerizing segues and sound snippets; the dynamic track sequencing reminds me of old Guided by Voices work.  Other influences are clearly John Lennon, Nick Drake, and - whoa - I even sense some Bright Eyes seeping in.  This is an album to cherish and ponder; it is wistful, powerful, and alive.
B0000026UV|4.0|A little too mellow for my taste but listen closely for some great picking between them. There is a very funny duet called \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" in which Chet wants to be a rock star so he can get money for nothing, etc. There are some great musicians such as Larrie Londin on drums, Steve Wariner on bass, Mark O'Connor on fiddle and mandolin and Vince Gill on vocals. Why is Dire Straits no more? Knopfler get tired of being a rock star? I miss them.  <br />
B00004STDN|4.0|Sylvester Stallone turned upside down did show aging effect on his body. <br /> <br />Yet, his meticulous touches in face actions were still near perfecto.  Bravo, if Sylvester Stallone could still do one movie like that, the audience will be lucky. <br /> <br />Without Sylvester Stallone to be there, the show might be only worth watching for the fall of Sarah and the concentrated focus of Jessica in rescuing.  But even those, anybody can do the work. <br /> <br />Sylvester Stallone chose a tough career.  Acting is a fun but difficult living.  This actor must love acting.  The real sense of relieving from acting is again viewed in his final note where he held Jessica but showing all the signs ready to move on to either the reality of the life or to another acting role.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Alright people, here's the Avril lowdown (for this C.D. anyway). There seems to be something about her that inspires extreme feelings in one way or another. But that is Avril herself: here is the issue about her CD. <br />There is nothing overly compelling about it. \\"My Happy Ending\\" is a rather good song, not profound in the way that a more \\"classic\\" and \\"here to stay\\" musician would write, but for a pop artist it is pretty good. A few other songs are nice, like \\"Nobody's Home,\\" which is less radio-single-ish, \\"Who Knows\\" is not bad (not great though), \\"Fall To Pieces\\" and \\"Freak Out\\" are also not bad (and sort of good), and \\"Slipped Away\\" is okay but gets annoying fast. The problem is that there isn't enough diversity or grab-you-and-not-let-go goodness to make this CD truly recommendable. It hovers on the better side of mediocre: not bad enough to dis, not good enough to get excited about. <br />That said, I am not crying over buying this CD. I probably would again, but only if I was wandering around with an extra fifteen dollars in my pocket, molding. But if you really love Avril, buy it. If you're her fan, you'll be glad to add it to your collection.
B000059H99|5.0|If Sylvester Stallone ever returned to be 29 years old again, we believe that he will do the same thing again. <br /> <br />An Athelete finally learned and accepted by the movie industry top pickers rapidly put together a performance that created a silver streak for the 1976 world, when the black were still discriminated and Italian Americans not heard of as a democractic voice. <br /> <br />Inching in, Sylvester Stallone hit good pitch as a mulberry worm snipped around its predated mulberry leave.  This dude, the then Italian Will Smith who inherited from Malone Brando's \\"On the Waterfront\\" style, got a few points right and left there correctly. <br /> <br />His was a great start.  A very impressive performance, done with light-hearted touches all over the show. <br /> <br />The performance created astounding impression even on boys aged 17 still today.  Amazingly powerful, it foretells the era of changing in American democracy, which perhaps worried this actor since his \\"F.I.S.T.\\" explicitly shared his concerns on the issue. <br /> <br />Sylvester Stallone began with this film a torch-carrying career ignited by American pizza makers--the Italian Americans and other Italian American actors and actresses.  A career only recently showed explicitly with his participation at the Olympic torch carrying of 2004. <br /> <br />Long way he ran, and long way still people needed to run following him, between that 1818 apartment room till the statue erected Philly Museum of Art. <br /> <br />Sylvester Stallone is no commoner in creed, and one ought not to evaluate and assess this person on the base of rules set by the WASP on commoners who suffocated under its people-fooling political philosophy. <br /> <br />Shame goes to the WASP elites who only knew how to conquor and to do that rapidly.  Cheers to Sylvester Stallone.  Whose role in the American Democratization is no smaller than that played by Martin Luthur King. <br /> <br />Long Live Sylvester Stallone. Guard him well yooooooooooooo Body guards of Sly's.  Don't ever never let another Martin Luthur King die or fooled into death by the foolish sort of the Wasps.
B000002IZ4|5.0|People go on about the brilliance of 'Interstate Love Song' and 'Big Empty', the two biggest hits from the album. Many of the listeners are, lets be polite, not fully aware of this album's appeal...and fail to see beyond the obvious. Don't listen to these people. Don't get me wrong I like the smash hits from Purple, but there are far greater things if you JUST LISTEN.<br /><br />Meatplow instantly brings back memories of Core, I can just imagine the hippie student, massive Core fan, sticking in Purple and hearing the first few chords, 'whoa cool man'. Meatplow is nonetheless a good song with a very catchy hook, despite being a little too derivative. Unfortunately for our hippie friend he gets bombarred with some of the most melancholy, psychedelic and ultimately disturbing music to come out of the 90s. But hell, he doesn't know it.<br /><br />Lounge Fly is an excellent song- slow and brooding with visceral lyrics. Something the hippie will relish from this totally un-Core-ish album. Still Remains is the best song STP ever created, and one of my favourite songs of the genre. It's deceivingly dark, and portrays a difficult drug surfacing for Weiland with lyrics such as - 'If you should die first, ask if you could bring a friend' - Of course our generic American no-brainer (no digs honestly) won't pick up subtlety.<br /><br />The closer, Kitchenware & Candybars, not the hidden Led Zep cover that stinks, sums up Purple. K & C is a classic, it's just a fine, miserable, gloomy and depressive closer, leaving a dark and bitter taste in the mouth. But all in a good way.<br /><br />There are real psycho songs on here, such as Vaseline and Unglued which reflect the good side of drugs - the getting high bit. These songs are undoubtedly psychedelic, acting as nice contrasts to the rest of the serious tone.<br /><br />Purple is, on a whole, a very deep and moving album. Obviously influenced by drug addictions and the up/down life that entails.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|this cd is magnificent.. in fact just about any song this man recorded is brilliant. People complain about the underproduction and siplicity of the album, but if those are your comments on the album then obviously you misunderstood thats what mr. rice was going for.. the story behind damien rice is like a fairy tale, his wishes not to exploit his cd is apparent in the cds lack in over production and stripped down sound... each song has its own sort of story behind it and my favorite would have to be cheers darlin. The story behind this song is Damien was at a bar flirting with a woman all evening and at the end of the evening she simply calls her boyfriend.. after getting home drunk damien sets up his microphone and records just about all of the song in a couple hours making most up as he goes along, from the vocals, to the chords, to the clanking of the glasses in the backround, and delivered a masterpiece. You can even tell in the singers voice he is yet to sober up. Mr. Rice's voice is very sincere and sometimes shows hints of his irish accent. The reviewers who criticized his voice must be out of his mind, i dont know what kind of voice they expect to go along with this great emotional music. he sometimes gets off the beat of his guitar to complete his thoughts but why should he not? just because this isnt an artist thats willing to take out his own creativity to make something radio friendly does not make him any less of an artist. <br />in his next album damien plans to implement the full band he travels with and make a louder sounding cd, i personally liked the softer acoutic side but as apparent on rare tracks like woman like a man, damien can make some electric gems too. <br /> <br />the dvd is worthwile if your a damien rice fan, if you dont like him as much then obviosly buy the cd without the dvd to save yourself from complaining. I also recommend the B-sides cd for some good rarities from Damien.
1559409010|5.0|Firstly I would only recommend The Life Of Brian to either a) die-hard Python fans b) someone with a genuinely warped sense of humour, and of course c) a complete nutter. If none of the above fits your frame I would suggest to stay away, as you will in all probability have your IQ offended. If not, WATCH THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />The plot is very loosely based on the general hatred towards the romans, despite the fact they brought education, sanitation, roads, wine, pretty much everything in society back then. Brian is born, not far from Jesus causing a brief confusion for the three wise men, he leads a normal life until he falls for a woman. This woman is not just any woman, she's a member of the People's Front Of Judea, not to be mistaken for the [...] Judean People's Front. Brian joins the group and is caught by the romans during a failed mission to capture Pilot's wife. Brian escapes and somehow finds himself being followed by hundreds of people claiming him to be the Messiah. Brian is eventually caught and crucified (there's a very funny running joke about how pathetic crucifixion is) and all of his friends fail to save him, even the dreaded Judean People's Front fail, commiting suicide and claiming \\"eh, that showed 'em\\".<br /><br />The film contains so many funny moments, I'll just list a few:<br /><br />Palin as Caesar is superb, he's got a speech impediment and can't say the letter 'r' without pronouncing it 'w'. He has a friend named Bigus Dicus who also has a speech impediment, this time it's the 's' that's the problem.<br /><br />One joker who keeps popping up has an argument with another man while Jesus is trying to speak, he keeps saying the man has a big nose - \\"Well it is true, you do have a very big nose\\" - \\"I'm only pointing out the obvious, you've got a very big nose.\\" - \\"shut up big nose\\" - \\"listen big nose\\". It's very funny when you watch it.<br /><br />The funniest bit in the whole film is when Brian is being chased by the Romans and runs up a spire, only to find there's no stairs down so he jumps to certain death. Luckily for him an alien spaceship swoops down and saves him, goes back up into space, has an engine failure and crashed about five foot away from where it all started. Brian walks out and a man who watched it all says \\"You lucky bastard!\\"<br /><br />I won't go in to any more detail, you just have to watch the film.so he jumps to certain death. Luckily for him an alien spaceship swoops down and saves him, goes back up into space, has an engine failure and crashed about five foot away from where it all started.

0671027387|2.0|This book is a thriller/conspiracy book that involves NASA and a mysterious meteorite in Greenland.  It has a relatively good story, however if you have a problem with plot holes, this is a book to steer clear of.  If you don't know much about or don't care about the way the US government and military works, this book won't be bad.  Several things that are key to the plot, and several that aren't, detract from the author's work.  For one, the basis of the entire book is shock and frustration that NASA is spending $15 billion a year.  Unfortunately, this is a miniscule portion of the government's budget, and shouldn't shock anyone.  Then there are the myriad of improbable to impossible technologies, along with minor details that make it apparent the author didn't quite research everything he should of.  Overall, its a good story with lots of little details that really get in the way.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|\\"Be The Rain\\" is worth the price of admission all by itself. The rest of the tunes are gravy in comparison. This is vibrant proof that Neil Young is a ROCK GOD and deserves his reputation for unbridled genius. BUY THIS CD NOW AND PLAY IT UNTIL THE SUN BURNS OUT. Good? It's GREAT!!!!!!
B000148KK2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife, and through a quirk, she ended up letting me listen to it first, on a trip with my daughter.  I found the album a virtual emotional smorgasbord, from the powerfully haunting \\"Girl in the Other Room\\", to the earthy and delightful \\"Love me Like a Man.\\"  Since our tastes in jazz differ, I then wasn't sure how my wife would recieve it, but she loved it!  Listened to nothing else in her car for nearly 2 weeks! <br /> <br />The clarity and nuanced presentation of her deeply felt emotions is wonderful, especially singing her own work.  I am strongly, deeply, and at times profoundly touched by music in this album.  And it only gets better with each listening.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is the most successful female artist of all time for a reason....80 million worldwide sales with only 4 albums under her belt proves that she is no one hit wonder! <br />This album is amazing! it includes most of her biggest hits over the last 10 years, and lets face it, she has had a LOT! It also includes 3 brand new songs which are just more future hits for our lovely Shania! <br />Shania's 3 new songs include 2 versions of her fun yet classy \\"Party For 2\\", one which will appeal to her country fanbase and one which will appeal to her international fans, it includes her very country swing song \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" which is extremely catchey and puts half the writers in Nashville to shame, and finally Shania's new ballad entitled \\"Don't!\\" which I can only describe as simply BEAUTIFUL! Trust me when I say this, it is worth buying this album for \\"Don't!\\" ALONE, I just hope that when Shania releases this as a single that it gets the recognition it deserves because it is just an amazing piece of work, right up there with \\"You're Still The One\\"! <br /> <br />Overall, this album is just solid, packed with mega hits and great songs! This is without doubt one of the best Greatest Hits albums ever compiled and anyone who gives it less then 4 stars obviously has no clue on what great songs are and has seriously bad taste in music! <br /> <br />Buy this album now, it will be the best $10 you ever spend!
B00029LNHS|5.0|This is a very good album. All tracks are hot! This group's lyrics are smart, and tight. \\"Smells like funk\\" is musically mature, the lyrics are so sweetly intertwined as they play off one rap to the next--just sheer clever writing. It is STANKY! You will be moved by the thought provoking \\"The Apl song.\\" I can't say enough about this album except buy it now!
B000002KDO|5.0|WOW - to date Sabbath created the heaviest 2 albums ever made and you think to yourself - where do they go from here? Well the answer becomes sickeningly obvious soon enough - they create an even more powerful sound and attitude.<br /><br />Are you kidding me? Right from the first seconds of `Sweet Leaf' - Sabbath show the world they are the innovators of the heaviest sound ever. The first 2 albums were metal and all - but they were blues based and Sabbath was still finding themselves. On this 3rd outing - the heavens opened and out poured the heaviest blobs of doom imaginable.<br /><br />Pure timeless boundless heaviness. Every second of this album is perfect. Inventors of stoner metal, doom metal, heavy metal  - every metal. Sabbath is beyond the shackles of mankind on this album  - they have progressed to some other-worldy existence of perfection.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence-A small rock band from Arkansas with powerful vocalist-Amy Lee is far more than impressive in their major-label debut. The synchonization and combination of Ben Moody's lead guitar with Amy Lee's powerful voice clashed with the secondary guitar and drums creates an unbelievably AWESOME sound... This release sold over 10 million copies becoming certified 5x Platinum which surpasses the band which they have been most compared to - Linkin Park as they sold 8 million copies of their debut Hybrid Theory.  <br /> <br />The album starts with the PG-Rated rocker called  <br />\\"Going Under\\" boasting Lee's high pitched voice abilities with clashing guitars and drums... the song is AWESOME though the video could have better  <br />5/5 <br /> <br />It then leads onto what was their debut single:  <br />\\"Bring Me to Life\\"  <br />The electronic spooks are ingenious and nothing could make this track sound any better... <br />This song shot them onto the international music scene and was a #1 Hit. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Everybody's Fool\\"  <br />which has a lot of guitar-work proceeds next. It has less of the drum-feeling and a much more guitar-ish feeling. <br />Amy's voice is awesome on this track and the song is great but the video is even better!  <br /> <br />Good Song, AWESOME Video!  <br />4/5 <br /> <br />\\"My Immortal\\"  <br />is a beautifully composed slow song compared to the hard-rocker tracks on this album. Lee's voice sounds beatiful with the piano... I find the video quite boring though and the percussion version (the one where the drums and guitar come in at the end) much better.  <br />(Yes, the percussion version is included on the CD too as a hidden track) <br /> <br />Other awesome tracks: Haunted, Tourniquet, My Imaginary, Whisper, and Everything else on the CD!  <br /> <br />Evanescene is a name which will obviously be around for years to come and this album will surely be in my \\"Greatest CDs\\" Collection... <br />
B000002KB8|5.0|This is it folks - the very first HEAVY METAL album in history. Some absolute perennial classics here - my favorites being Behind the Wall of Sleep and<br />N.I.B. ( which is just NIB - as in a pen nib - Bill Wards nickname - not some acronym as per urban myth).<br /><br />Metal start here - begin the journey with the originators of the genre. Not their best album but a giant kick in the head to the music industry at the time - and a great first record.
B000001EYW|3.0|Bee Gees had been sort of neglected from the US since You Win Again, and this comeback startled the US CHart with Alone. This album features very emotional songs. <br /> <br />1. Alone - Barry's fake voice startled the whole song, with Robin's sweet voice in the middle of the song. <br /> <br />2. I Surrender - Absolute rock song.Great show of natural harmony, with mixes. <br /> <br />3. I Could Not Love You More - Changed back to the old-time ballad style, but gradually changed to rock. Barry's solo. <br /> <br />4. Still Waters Run Deep - Main chorus shows absolute harmony, performed in One Night Only as bonus track. <br /> <br />5. My Lover's Prayer - Robin's fantastic solo. Later produced as a CD Single with Cliff. <br /> <br />Other songs are not as remarkable other than Closer Than Close <br /> <br />Closer than Close - Maurice Solo, went to US 46. <br /> <br />   A good start with the few starting songs, but eventually become boring album like 2 Years On.
B000002KFJ|5.0|What do I say about the album I consider to be the BEST album ever created?? Words do not do this album justice. It is a masterwork of epic proportions.<br /><br />Perhaps more than anything - this album cements Black Sabbath as pure musical geniuses. They reach down into the very pits of their souls - and summon a work of art so majestic, it defies suitable descriptions.<br /><br />At its simplest level - this album is unique, powerful, intense, complex - it is everything you could ever hope for from music. It is the amalgamation of four people and their ideas into one collective consciousness. It is beyond simple titles or description. It is not brilliant - rather it is BRILLIANCE.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I just saw the movie and absolutely loved the music.  I can't wait to get the soundtrack.  It will be a Christmas classic.
B000002KE2|5.0|Every Ozzy-era Sabbath album sounds different and it's interesting to hear the unique power that Sabbath create for this album.  Vol 4 is in and of itself brilliant. It stands alone as maybe the first `collection' of songs for the Sab Four. The three prior albums had an unspoken theme or feel to the tunes and Vol 4 strays from that comfort zone. Not that this is a bad thing - indeed Vol 4 is simply devastating.<br /><br />Lose yourself in the mood changes that unfolds with this colossal album. I must admit that `Changes' is weak - not at all a Sab song I enjoy but nevertheless this album is essential.<br /><br />Basically  - Sabbath moved forward in their metal progression. Once again they show that they alone are capable of creating something so meaningful.
B000002J09|5.0|This is the classic rock staple of all time. The #1 \\"song of all time\\" \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" which radio stations created a feeling of sickness when people heard it for the millionth time.  <br />I stayed away from listening to the entire album for 15 years and changing the radio station when I heard the first 3 notes of \\"Stairway\\", I gave in after picking up \\"BBC Sessions\\", \\"How The West Was Won\\" and the DVD, all of which I recommend to all the \\"haters\\".  <br /> <br />So with a fresh ear, here's how I felt about hearing it.  <br /> <br /> <br />Black Dog. A great opening song, it has a bluesy, classic Page riff, Plant's vocals are at its peak. Has a good groove to it.    <br /> <br />Rock and Roll. Bonham's cymbal bashing opens the song and the band kicks it into high gear. It's a wakeup call that it's time to get up out of your seats and rock like in the early days of rock... criticism is that the song is a Caddy commercial. Every garage band should know this one.    <br /> <br />The Battle of Evermore. Some people think it's Robert Plant singing those high vocals. The late Sandy Denny of Fairport Convention (a band which also features the amazing Richard Thompson) sings a duet with Robert. If you haven't picked up FC's \\"Halfbricking\\", you really should, as well as Roy Harper's CD (most of British rock royalty have been on Harper's albums, including Page). Led Zep opened me up to British folk-rock from this same time period....some amazing songs from that era.  <br /> <br />Stairway to Heaven. The song is a classic because of its structure, from light to shade in one shot. The words are nonsense, but as Robert would say, \\"It's a song of hope\\". A road to enlightenment is a better way to describe it.  <br /> <br />Misty Mountain Hop: The words are somewhat dated. Their \\"hippiest\\" song. Still, classic Page/Bonham nonetheless.  <br />  <br />Four Sticks: Probably the weakest as far as most people are concerned. To me it's classic Bonham/Plant with a sound that you'd hear more on \\"Houses of the Holy\\".   <br />  <br />Going to California: Plant and Page LOVED Joni Mitchell (pick up Blue and prove if I'm wrong), and wrote the song for her. It's one that comes off nicely live, both back then and in 94. A nice song overall.  <br /> <br />When the Levee Breaks: Classic Bonham. An old Memphis Minnie cover done the Zep way. One to crank up in the car to 11, it still has a driving force over 30 years later.   <br /> <br />
B000002KHH|5.0|What to say about a record that most everyone knows? I'm sure it's the best-selling Sabbath record ever made and pretty much everyone I know has it - even if it's the only Sabbath album they own.<br /><br />First off, it's not their best work. Super classic `War Pigs' is amazing, as is `Paranoid', `Planet Caravan' and `Hand of Doom'. The rest of the songs work well except for `Iron Man'. Sure the riff is the stuff of legends but I have always hated the song. It is just too goofy - and the story or lyrics are weak.<br /><br />The cover art is laughable - couldnt they have something better??<br /><br />Bottom line - you need to own this album. It will change your life for the better.
B00063MBU8|1.0|this band simple plan is something maintreamers couldnt understand. there destroying music, they made a new album, with same lyrics, they just reuse it. well ill stop rhyming this band is another poser group that catches the kids of ages 8 to 16 years old and its retarded. it reminds me of junk music and why the hell did it get 5 stars. this albums is soo bad. there are sooo many better bands out there like Rage Against The Machine and Anthrax. I even pick Cypress Hill Over these posers. and i dont even listen to rock i listen to rap. ok ok you want me to be serious ok fine. My suggestions for other bands to get than this stupid simple plan listen to bands like Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, Mobb Deep, Nastradamus, Eric B and Rakim. you should listen to the way Mobb Deep plays instruments like how they play guitar and the drums really good. snoop doggs band is really good the song in nuthin but a G thang is great you can even hear the drums and the bassist of snoop doggs band is really good. am i right?? LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00065VTU4|5.0|This album brings back memories. I remember first hearing \\"I shot the sheriff\\" in a bar and immediately thinking that EC had \\"sold out\\" by moving beyond his 'guitar hero\\" image. How wrong I was!! This is a great album that easily has worn the test of time. The band is arguably Clapton's best of his solo units (and there IS plenty of great guitar work). It is, in a way, a cross between the D&TD album and his first solo effort. During ECs tenure in Blind Faith, he became passionately interested in the music of the Band. This influence is evident here in the ensemble playing, shared vocal chores, economical guitar playing and the deadened drum sounds. However, ECs strong musical personality makes the album his own. Great original songwriting and an excellent choice of covers. The live material is a wonderful treat. It is great to hear those renditions finally on a legit release. For those of you interested, THIS IS WHERE CLAPTON'S SOLO CAREER REALLY BEGINS TO COOK. Long may he live!!!!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Where oh where to begin? Green Day has pioneered the new punkwave since the early 90s. A band can't stay the same forever or they will enevitably stale themselves. Bla bla bla. The point is, after the dissapointing experiment that was Warning, the Thrashing Three have returned with what is undoubltebly their best effort since Dookie. <br />Not that this is straightfoward ventage Greenday, but this album does the same thing '94s did. It wakes you up and shakes you up. Honestly, I feel like I'm listening to this great band for the first time again (an ability few groups can capture again and again). The songs that are good, are so good that the weaker tracks can't detter me from giving less than 4 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />Time for everyone's favorite part: THE BREAK DOWN! <br /> <br />AMERICAN IDIOT: (A-) Different, but it works. Lot's of effects and a new sound that still sounds familiar. (if that makes sense)As long as it's fast, who cares, right? <br /> <br />JESUS OF SUBERBIA: (A) Such a sweet start off! Part 1 drops like a bomb! CITY OF THE DAMNED keeps the energy going strong. I DON'T CARE takes us back to juvenile Greenday. DEARLY BELOVED lifts us up to Warning-like foot-tappers. and TALES OF ANOTHER BROKEN HOME is a very sweet send off! <br /> <br />HOLIDAY: (A+) Great tune, definition of anthem. Get you're friends to yell along with you- It's about time they started writing songs like this. <br /> <br />BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS: (B+) Settles down a bit, but not a bad song by any means. There's agressive romanticism here. The acoustic version is a definate A <br /> <br />ARE WE THE WAITING: (A+) This one soars above anything they've done before. Tell me you don't want to let yourself fly as if on top of a roof after hearing this. Epic song writing. <br /> <br />ST. JIMMY: (A) Classic punk. Don't worry fans, Greenday is still here.  <br /> <br />GIVE ME NOVACAINE: (B+) Remenicent of something off Nimrod or even Insomniac lyrically, I like the hook.  <br /> <br/>SHE'S A REBEL: (B-) Another fast one, but a little more annoying. Becareful, it might get stuck in your head. <br /> <br />EXTRODINARY GIRL: (C) Now this doesn't sound like something GreenDay would write at all. Instumentally boring and repetative. <br /> <br />LETTERBOMB: (B) Another Nimrod sounding track. Decent- not bad, but not special. Just kinda there. Kinda catchy chorus. <br /> <br />WAKE ME UP IN SEPTEMBER: (B+) I do like listening to his vocals on this melody. When it crescendos it becomes much meatier, and therefore, better. <br /> <br />HOMECOMING: (B) The beginning is a cool sounding BJ solo. Then it gets really catchy (Poor St Jimmy). EAST 12TH STREET gets a little poppy for my taste and has too many rhythm changes, but alot of people like it. NOBODY LIKES YOU This second epic is winding down, ROCK N ROLL GIRLFRIEND is not BJ! What is this? Grease? WE'RE COMING HOME AGAIN starts a little 60s also, but the last part is soooo great. I punches like an Offspring song I tells ya! <br /> <br />WHATSERNAME: (B-) Meh. Sounds like other pop punk bands. They should have finished this album with the previous track.  <br /> <br />As far as subject matter goes, Jesus of Suburbia/American idiotic themes underlie like blood flow through the veins of the disc. Each song is so unique or related, that this truly feels like it could be a 'best of Green Day' album to the casual ear.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|First of all, yes, this is pretty much a Roger Waters solo album. However! Roger Waters actually OFFERED to make it a solo album, so if Gilmour and Manson are mad, it's their own faults, honestly.  <br /> <br />Now, the review. To put it shortly, Waters is a talented bugger; he wrote all the music and the lyrics, and it's very good. Some beautiful moods, such as on the much too short \\"One Of The Few\\". Think \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" from The Wall, but better. Truthfully, there are no bad songs on this album, although some dislike \\"Not Now John\\" because it's very \\"rocky\\", I love it, but that is my opinion, of course. The instruments are quite excellent, especially the bass. Of course, there's no Wright, but it works just as well without the poor fellow. I have to give it to to Gilmour, too; the guitar  is top notch. Gilmour is in all honesty as good  if not better then  the rather overrated John Lennon. Manson's drums however are another story; he's not even trying. He didn't play the drums on the last track, \\"Two Suns\\", which is noticeably better in that department. Also, Waters' voice is better then on The Wall, and it fits the songs wonderfully. You can tell he's exceedingly emotional about it; of course; it was  for his father.  Very touching. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent and biting commentary on the war.
0783235615|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock used the true story of the KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn [New Lies For Old, The Perestroika Deception] and made it into a brilliant movie. <br />Golitsyn's real escape from Helsinki's Russian Embassy in 1961 is portrayed here as real challenge although it is not shown how difficult it must've been in reality. <br />Russian communists were aware of Golitsyn's potential so much that the KGB operations in Finland had to be re-assessed and changed. <br />In the film Russian defector tells the CIA all important facts about the Soviet infiltration of France's intelligence services, in reality Golitsyn has not only uncovered many Soviet spies inside the US, U.K. and French governments and intelligence services, he also has warned the West of the Soviet long-range plans for the future \\"collapse of communism\\" which is not [unfortunately] mentioned in this movie. <br />Hitchcock has done a great job by illustrating how evil communism truly is, by showing the situation in Cuba, the tyrannical oppressive communist machine that will not stop at anything including torture and murder. <br />Topaz is a masterful movie and should be viewed by many people to remind them that communism, as hideous and horrific this ideology is, shouldn't be allowed to remain alive and well because of its deadly potential that threatens the mankind. <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|First off the, the packaging looks amazing!! It somes in a silver foil embossed case, with two CD's. The first one is the Greatest Hit's CD with all the classic hits ranging from the bubbly ...Baby One More Time to the sexy I'm A Slave 4 U. There are 3 new songs, including My Prerogative on the album. I've Just Begun, was released in Europe, but that's it and Do Somethin' has a very cool dance/rock feel to it. <br /> <br />By the way, ta1986, you don't know all the facts. Selling 10 million albums of your sophomore release is nothing to be upset about. Her 3rd album, was released a month after September 11th. The country wasn't rushing out to go buy new albums, were they? Plus, people started downloading music, so that hurt the sales too. And for In The Zone, she has sold a total of 2,849,000 copies, not just 2 million, and it's still selling around 5000-6000 copies a week. Plus, the first week sales of her 3rd and 4th album only had about a 100k difference. Her singles off In The Zone have been doing great. Toxic reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Everytime reached #15. Both of these singles debuted at #1 on the UK singles charts, and the Greatest Hits album is set to be her first UK #1. Britney already has her first #1 album in Japan with the Greatest Hits CD. She's not over...check your facts. <br /> <br />I understand that not everyone likes Britney, but when people are just flat out rude, it's completely un-necessary. It's not everyone's style of music, and if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you can review their album unfairly. There's ton of people I don't like, but I just don't listen to their music and that's the end of it. I'm pretty sure that some of the people with the bad reviews haven't even bought the album. Everyone says their expressing their opinion, but a lot of you are bashing her...
B00063MBU8|2.0|What on earth is so appealing about these guys? They don't do anything special that any other pop-punk band doesn't, except maybe their whinier. I'm 15- around the target age of this CD, and I still crack up at the fake, derived attempts at teenage angst on this CD. If you want teenage angst at least listen to a band that makes it seem natural, like Good Charlotte. \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is probably the saddest attempt ever at a 25 year old trying to be a teenager. \\"Shut Up\\"- this song sounds EXACTLY like the song \\"Don't Wanna Think About You\\". Theres absolutely nothing special about it at all. \\"Perfect World\\" is just lazy and boring. \\"Thank You\\" is actually an okay song, sort of like a speed pop-punk song. \\"Me Against The World\\" attempts something different, and it ends up being pretty good. The rest of the songs are a bunch of sappy ballads or more generic pop-punk tunes. This band can only seem to write in 2 styles: either the \\"go away I'm an angry teenager, life sucks\\", or the boyband style sappy love songs. Plus, why only 11 songs and under 40 minutes? Their last CD had like 14 songs and was over 45 minutes. Blah.
B0000019PA|5.0|What can be said about this album that hasn't been said before? I acknowledge that it is not for everyone (most people do not want to hear such intense and terrible emotions in their music), but for those who \\"get it\\", it becomes a religion of sorts. It has been five years since the first song hit my ears, but its freshness and joy never diminishes in my mind. The music connects with you, not only on a visceral level but a subconscious one as well. It is the soundtrack to your dreams, and art that is uncommonly and fully actualized. God bless Jeff Mangum for this gift.
B0000028UK|5.0|In my opinion, this PJ album rocks harder that any other.  I was asked once why I love this band so much, and I said it's like a dysfunctional love affair- they kick my ass, then kiss the welts.  And that's exactly what this album does, every time, even 11 years later.  I listened to it again just this morning, and it blew my head wide open.  This band continues to amaze me, and last year's live shows split me in two.  Other cherished albums of theirs (not that I don't love them all...): East Troy bootleg, 10/8/00; Seattle boot 11/6/00, Vitalogy, Live on Two Legs, No Code... I could go on, but I won't, because I'd never be able to stop and I'm supposed to be working!!!  My message to the band- thank you, thank you, thank you.  You are loved.  I think I'll let you beat me up on the way home, too.  ;-)
1577311523|5.0|This book changed my life.  When I first read it, I was getting bogged down in the details.  Then I decided to just read and not try to grasp every nuance.  When I finished, I was so profoundly moved, I went on line to try to find a group discussion of this book.  Unsuccessful, I started my own group with three friends.  We meet ad hoc and discuss just a chapter at a time.  Each of us has had miraculous experiences in our lives when using these principals to solve problems or difficult relationships.  After 15 years of therapy, I respectfully told my counselor that had I read and comprehended this book in the beginning, I never would have had the need for therapy.  <br /> <br />I keep the CDs in my car and have listened to them four or five times. I have given this book as a gift many times.  Unfortunately, some people find it hard reading and give up after the first few chapters. (\\"You can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink.\\") Those who have \\"pressed on\\" cannot thank me enough for introducing me to Tolle. I hope you will read this book and enjoy the change it will make in your life. <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|As a Jew whose parents were both survivors of Auschwitz, I tend to agree with comedian Jackie Mason when he said (around the time this turkey of a film was being released into theatres) \\"Mel Gibson is dipping his hands into the blood of the six million\\".  I am shocked that there are not more reviews on here which take note of and condemn this film's anti-Semitism.   I suppose that in some respect I should thank Mel Gibson. He brought me back to G-d.  My G-d.  Our G-d.  Who was and is One, and transcendent; unable to be represented by images , and ,  G-d help those who claim it,  has never and will never bear any sort of \\"offspring\\", even if this is supposed to have been done somehow \\"immaculately\\".   There have been many false prophets and Messiahs in our Jewish history.  I for one, as his fellow Jew, do not feel that Yeshua Bin N'zaret (as he is called, by his true name, in this film) WAS even truly a false Messiah.  I do not believe that the man ever claimed to BE the literal \\"son\\" , or \\"offspring\\", of G-d.  Having been raised a devout Jew he would have realized the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that idea. He would have known that such an idea was (and still is) a purely pagan type of belief.  So, the rhetorical question, \\"WWJD?\\"  In my opinion, what he would do, were he somehow to be raised magically from the dead and shown this world and told of this religion, \\"Christ\\"-ianity,  he would be appalled first and foremost.  He would be appalled at the sight of swarms of people (non-Jews the lot of them) worshiping HIM as the literal \\"son\\" of G-d, giving devotions and praying to him in the form of graven images of himself in his death throes upon that most cruel Roman instrument of execution.  He would probably want to find the nearest shul and prostrate himself in prayer to his G-d for the redemption of his Jewish people, and ask for forgiveness for having inadvertently soiled hallowed Judaic tradition in such a way.  And, we must ask ourselves, what if he were to learn of the many pogroms, and the Holocaust ?  His own people being driven out, being brutally persecuted and murdered, oftentimes \\"in his name\\" or because \\"they\\" had \\"killed him\\". It might simply be enough to make the man wish he had never been born into this world at all.                                                            The fact of the matter is that the man upon whom this movie is based did not intend to found ANY new religion distinct from his Judaism at all.  He was NOT, and this is quite paradoxical and hard to take in (from a goyish point of view) I realize, and would not have approved of anyone being, a \\"Christ\\"-ian.  The Jesus cult of today is simply a Judaized paganism, \\"Judaism for Gentiles\\".  NOT a true monotheism.  At least we must hand it to Islam that it is a true monotheism and believes in the one transcendent imageless G-d.    <br />    Going back to the question of \\"WWJD?\\",  Yeshua the man, Yeshua the Palestinian Jew from some two-thousand years ago, would probably have much more in common today with, would probably feel quite at home with , the Satmar Hasid strolling down Lee Street in South Williamsburg in Brooklyn, as opposed to the gentile American Southerner, of Scotch-Irish descent, who eats barbecued ribs on the Fourth of July and has a bumper sticker that reads \\"Jesus Saves\\" on his pickup truck.  Odds are, in fact, Yeshua the man would quite possibly not even want to have anything to do with these \\"meshuga goyim\\" (to use an old affectionate Yiddish/Hebrew phrase for them). Yeshua the man would, quite possibly, view these \\"Christ-ians\\" as nothing more than \\"barbarian pagans\\", untouchable \\"idolaters\\" and \\"eaters of swine\\".  THAT is in FACT what \\"Jesus\\" would do.  If one wants to worship the one true G-d, then one should do so.  But to do that one would have to convert to Judaism and become a Jew, like  \\"Jesus\\" was,  AT heart and through-and-through.  For G-d CANNOT be approached through crazydom,  through meshugadom,  through pagan ideas about his having borne a \\"son\\" with some promiscuous teenage Jewess from the Galilee.   Those are my sincerest thoughts on this film.   If you choose to watch it,  do so with what I have said in mind.
B00003CXCT|1.0|No, Lucas, I ain't buying this garbage.  you've been going downhill since Jedi, face it.    Thank you reviewers for pointing out the \\"lovely\\" additions, otherwise I might have been fooled that these were the \\"originals.\\"    And yes, I am one of those die hards who saw the first star wars (that is, episode IV), in the theater, though I was only four at the time... but so what?    That doesn't mean I'm an inflexible geek or loser.  I'm older with refined tastes and know what a good movie is, and Lucas makes garbage now, and has corrupted his original movies with more garbage.  I just don't see and praise every piece of hollywood garbage out there.    If you haven't yet, try to find the hilarious article about Jar jar in The Return of the King on B-spot.  It's right on target as to the lameness of Lucas and his current work...    -Alan (NYC) maker of \\"Continuity Wars\\"
B00003CXD0|5.0|This is one of the best and funniest comedies of all time.<br /><br />I've read the original script and it's brilliant.  The only difference in the film is Bill Murray's character: in the script he's described as the stereotypical New York playwright with a pipe and a tweed jacket with elbow pads, but his lines are the same.  Bill Murray gives the role some of the film's biggest laughs, but it's also fun to picture a droll, academic-looking guy saying his lines.<br /><br />The casting is wonderful.  It was good to see Jessica Lange win the Best Supporting Oscar but DUSTIN HOFFMAN SHOULD HAVE WON FOR THIS MOVIE!  No, I wouldn't take away his other Oscars--but TOOTSIE is the role where you see a master at work.  There are times I watch this movie simply to watch his expressions.  It's a part that works on numerous levels and Hoffman is funny on every one of them.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack not only flawlessly keeps the timing of the humor going, but he also contributes an authentic performance as Michael Dorsey--er, Dorothy Michael's agent.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that the DVD does not have a bunch of extras about the film.  Director's commentary, actor's commentary, even the writer's commentary--all would be fascinating, I'm sure.<br /><br />(One last note: I'm originally from Ohio and, for 20 years, I've had to convince some friends and family to watch this film because they didn't want to watch a \\"gay movie.\\"  Any movie where a guy dresses up like a girl has to be a gay movie.  Don't believe it.  TOOTSIE is a smart, intelligent film about the roles and characteristics of men and women--and how many comedies can you say that about?)
068987474X|4.0|I've never read a self help book before but heard about this lighthearted book at the perfect time in my life.  Although I believe that the information in this book is true I don't think a person should dump a guy for just one of the examples (unless he's cheating on you or is married).  Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide whats going on in their relationships.  This book turned out to be the confirmation I needed that I was wasting my time on a guy I thought would eventually get over his commitment issues.  Take the advice with a grain of salt and it will save you a lot of heartache in the long-run, but make sure you judge each relationship based on the facts not what some book says.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It's always sad when a group of people, bound by emotion, family, love and a shared musical vision, are so cruely taken from us by an uncaring and indifferent world. It's doubly sad when such a group were responsible for one of the loveliest, most under-rated albums of 2004. The Funeral will sadly have to be their epitaph and last will and testament. These songs will remain a glorious summation of that ineffable quality of life lived on the crest of a crashing wave, when a moment's perfection is backlit by its impending end. The band's influences were carefully integrated into the textures of their songs and pointed to such disparate sources as Bowie, 80s synth pop, the Pixies and Decline of British Sea Power, poured over with French Canadian imagery and song. We could've hoped for a glorious career for this band. Sadly, it wasn't to be. They came from nowhere, flowered for a day ... and vanished. All we have left to console ourselves with is the humdrum reality of manufactured pop rock, insipid chart-aspiring talentless Madonna-wannabe popstar hackettes, and Justin Timberlake.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|MacGyver on DVD!!!  (Officially!)  This is awesome!   <br />MacGyver is my favorite show of all time.  I grew up watching this show from beginning to end and it is so great to see it finally being given a full season by season release on DVD.   <br />For anyone who by some unfortunate chance has never gotten to see this show, definitely pick this set up.  (Though I wish Amazon would spell the name right.  The \\"G\\" is capitalized!) <br />Here's a few reasons why I like this show so much.  Well, okay, the first thing that drew me to the show was the great action and last minute escapes with MacGyverisms.  Amazing what you can do with a Swiss Army Knife, duct tape, and your wits! :-)   <br />I really liked the fact that he was against guns, smoking, drugs, and drinking. All in all, MacGyver is a great show that provides plenty of action and entertainment, actual useful knowledge, and a positive role model who portrays good morals. He also was one of the most caring heroes on TV who took time to help others just because they needed help. He really had genuine compassion and kindness towards others. I also like the way that he shook his hand after punching someone. It really showed a human side to him, that it's okay to say \\"ow\\" when you hurt. He was definitely a cool hero and those are all the reasons why I still love watching MacGyver today.
B000002H2H|5.0|I had Master of Puppets before I got this CD.  But in my opinion, RTL is even better of the classic album, Master of Puppets.  Grades for the songs: <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire With Fire (A-) <br />they're playing crazily fast and there's a guitar solo.  It's about an inevitable nuclear war. <br /> <br />2.Ride the Lightning (A+++) <br />I love this song.  it's about execution by electric chair, looking from the eyes of the convict.  it's awesome in the first place, then when the guitar solo comes, it gets better and better.  One of my favorite guitar solos ever.   <br /> <br />3.For Whom The Bell Tolls (A++) <br />the intro is the best part.  the whole song's great, but it's just awesome how it gets into the actual song.  It's one of the most classic Metallica songs. <br /> <br />4.Fade To Black (A+++++++) <br />Sorry about all the +'s, but this song deserves it.  I think it's the best Metallica song ever made.  it's about suicide.  LISTEN TO IT. there's really no way to describe how awesome it is.  The only Metallica song that could possibly compete with this is \\"One\\" from S&M. <br /> <br />5.Trapped Under Ice (A-) <br />This song has crazy guitar stuff in it.  It's a good song.  Even though it's probably the worst song on the CD, it's still way, way good. <br /> <br />6.Escape (A) <br />This song is so hard and it just flows so well.  It's not only got the crazy guitar solo, but it's got a catchy tune! yeah. :) <br /> <br />7.Creeping Death (A-) <br />This song and Escape go together well.  Actually the whole CD does, but that's not the point.  It's a concert favorite and a great song on RTL. <br /> <br />8.The Call of Ktulu (A++) <br />This song is better on S&M, But it's WAY awesome on RTL.  In my opinion, it's the best instrumental i've ever heard by anyone.  It probably evern surpasses \\"Orion\\" on Master of Puppets.  it's GREAT!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />RIDE THE LIGHTNING IS THE BEST CD EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem started his career in 1999 with his first LP entitled The Slim Shady LP, then he returned in 2000 with his sophomore album The Marshall Mathers LP, then in 2002 struck gold with The Eminem Show, which deserves 4.5 Stars.  Eminem gets more diverse with every album, every album has a different lyrical perspective than the other album before it.  That's why this CD, The Eminem Show is so good because of its' diversity.   *I will rate the following tracks on a scale from 1 to 5, 5 being the best.*  2. White America  - 4/5  3. Business - 3.5/5  4. Cleanin Out My Closet - 4.5/5  5. Square Dance - 4/5  7. Soldier - 3.5/5  8. Say Goodbye Hollywood  - 3.5/5  9. Drips  - 3/5  10. Without Me - 4/5  12. Sing For the Moment -  4.5/5  13. Superman  - 4/5  14. Hailie's Song  - 3.5/5  16. When the Music Stops  - 3.5/5  17. Say What You Say - 4.5/5  18. 'Till I Collapse - 4.5/5  19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - 3.5/5  ~If you are a fan of Eminem then you should definently get this album.  If you are a fan of Hip-Hop you should definently get this album.  If you're a causal music listener you should definently get this album.~
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have just recently discovered Gavin DeGraw thanks to a friend, and I must say, there is no one like him. I went to his show last week in Georgia, and it was the best I have ever been to. There is no doubt this man has a magical voice that can melt anyone's heart. I highly recommend this CD. You will listen to it over and over.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Stone Coldest Justice is obviously not a Britney Spears fan.  He also cannot write a coherent sentence which doesn't really make Texans look too smart.  I don't know why people would write a review of something they clearly have not listened to.  Unless he is just a closet Britney fan, I doubt he has listened to this album.  If you like Britney, then it's great to get all these tracks together in one place.  It is also packaged pretty well and gives you good reason to add it to your Britney collection.  To me, it is impressive that In the Zone was her best album after everyone said that she was going to fall off the face of the earth.  No, I don't approve of everything she does, but she can definitely crank out a catchy song that will get stuck in your head while you're at work.  I would not recommend this album to someone who hates Britney because I doubt that they will suddenly come to appreciate her music, but for those of us who love good rock n roll but still appreciate pop music at its best, this is an essential piece of pop culture.
B00005JMUL|5.0|This was a great Christmas movie from the man that brought us Back to the Future,Who Framed Roger Rabit and Forrest Gump-Robert Zemeckis.I went to see this movie yesterday and I thought the movie was great!Right from the start the movie grabs you and dont let go until the end.I'm not sure how well this movie will do?As the theater I went to yesterday was not very packed,only 3 adults and 1 child was at my showing,not a very good start for opening day! Perhaps people are waiting for the weekend.Any way I loved this movie and cant wait to buy on DVD,this will be a Christmas movie that like A Christmas Story will never die! Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis make a great team!

Directed and framed with a lot of class by director Nick Cassavettes and cinematographer Robert Fraisse.  Wonderful work all around!! Thanks for enriching my life, guys!!
B00005JMUL|5.0|I went to see this movie tonight with a mentally handicapped friend - \\"Michael\\" -- (from a L'Arche home here in Winnipeg, Canada).  We were the first persons in the theatre for the very first evening showing in this city - and we were the last to leave.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - enchanted by the movie's subtleties and happily exhausted by its roller-coaster rides.<br /><br />Time and again, Michael (who is sensitive, compassionate and with a good sense of humor) turned to me in the darkness, smiling in appreciation at the exact same moments I turned to see his reactions. Each time this happened, it was at a moment in the film when some little detail, perfectly captured through superb 'cinematography,' brought moisture to my normally cynical eye, and a warm smile to Michael's innocent face.<br /><br />Some examples:  There is a lone, black child on this apparent 'dream train' to the North Pole - a girl of about ten or eleven years, and like a painting come to life, the miraculous technology at work in this film  captures the particular sensibilities of this  compassionate, black youngster ---  We see small mannerisms of someone comfortable with herself in a way the other (ten or so) white kids on the train are not.  And the effect is profound --- the movie audience, including some children of that same age group, went silent at such moments in the film.<br /><br />My friend Michael - who has a 'savant' genius for perceiving my emotions, and expressing them for me out loud in public --- Michael turned to me with a delighted smile when the girl on the train reaches out to hold the hands of the poorest boy, sitting alone in the rear compartment; and later, she hugs two other boys, (one of them the central character) --- at their final parting. At that moment I held up a finger to my lips to try to hush Michael, but couldn't prevent him from saying aloud:  \\"She's such a sweetheart.\\"  There were murmurs of appreciation in the darkness around us, responding to this innocent sentiment.<br /><br />There is a sublime moment, on the back platform of the moving train -- the Northern Lights glimmering in the distance -- when the young girl joins in song with the poorest kid on the train (a younger boy from a dilapidated home on the \\"far side of the tracks\\"). I admit to being overcome with emotion during this duet (a lovely, strong melody with poignant lyrics) - and I blurted out loud to Michael, after the first chorus: \\"What a wonderful song!\\"  The refrain includes the words \\"When Christmas comes to town.\\"  [It's a song so good that, with some future 'cover versions' by serious musicians who could do it justice ---  this \\"Christmas Comes to Town\\" song could, I believe, deservedly join the small list of true, Christmas 'classics.']<br /><br />I'd have to agree with anyone who thinks this movie is a little short on plot.  And yet . . .  once you've suspended disbelief --  beginning with an earth-shattering, Christmas-eve arrival of a steam-puffing, passenger train on a small-town Michigan street, directly outside the home of the movie's central character -- once we've swallowed that premise, the movie disarmingly embraces the child in us, (including our fears) and our reservations vanish without our noticing.<br /><br />Just as great `realistic' painters, (think Rembrandt or Vermeer) worked wonders of light & shadow that no mere photograph could ever capture, so too this computer-animated marvel takes your breath away through an accumulation of tiny but acute observations that could never be captured by conventional cinematography. Prime examples from the opening scenes:<br /><br />A shaft of light illuminates the boy's bedroom, and he is reflected in a chrome, automobile hubcap leaning against a wall; at once we share his view -- through the keyhole of his bedroom door - we can see only the backs and the dressing gowns of mother and father, as they say goodnight to the boy's young sister, after determining the state of her belief in Santa's existence - a belief no longer shared by the older brother, whose eye is at the keyhole.<br /><br />Later, on the train, there's an exquisite close up of the boy's face, a slight blemish above the pores on his upper right cheek; the `camera' pans in rotation, capturing perfectly, the texture of the boy's hair, and that of the young black girl sitting beside him  -- subtleties of such perfection one wonders if the unique, artistic accomplishment of \\"Polar Express\\" could ever be surpassed.<br /><br />The film's last scene, consists entirely of a close-up view of a small, silver bell (of the type associated with sleigh rides) with its attached 'ribbon' of red leather.  The little bell helps make the final point about `Belief' --- in things unseen, (or forgotten, and thus inaccessible to some adults). So simple, so powerful, so enlightening an image. My friend Michael turned to me at that moment, with a radiant smile. And we just shook our heads in awe.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Yes, this movie must have SOME shortcomings - one or two moments that don't quite work as intended by the creators.  But right now, in the afterglow, I can't recall what they were. The film  was just too satisfying an experience!<br /><br />I'm a 57-year-old grandfather who happens to believe that \\"The Polar Express\\" is the first, true Christmas classic in almost 60 years.

B00000J2KX|4.0|This movie was awesome. There is no doubt. I bought this movie and I do not regret it. But the thing is the movie does not have one scary part, if you there Jack axing his way to the bathroom is scary, I feel sorry for you, you are probably scared that there are monsters under your bed too :-). But the movie is entertaining, but the movie was better. (Book spoilers ahead!) <br /> <br />Where are the hedge animals? The clock being bashed? The explosion of the Overlook? The Presidental Suite? What the hell are those 2 girls in there for? Unless I missed them in the book, they have no use there (I know they are Grady's daughters). 237 but not 217? Is Dr. Emmonds that female doctor? Dick Holeron dies in the movie?????? WHAT?!?!? Stuart Ullman WANTS to hire Jack? All Stanley had to do was change the concept of the Shining and call it something different, change a few names here and there, and mixed the plot a little bit, and it would have no relation to the book. <br /> <br />The book is great, the movie is good. But I would read the book then watch the movie. The acting is good in the movie, Stanley Kubrick is a good director, and a good story, but is not as good as the book.

B00005JNEI|2.0|I bought this thinking it had something to do with September 11, 2001.   <br /> <br />Boy was I wrong!   <br /> <br />This film was nothing but a long drawn out B.S. political commercial against President Bush.   <br /> <br />It starts with some rediculous accusations concerning the Florida ordeal in the election of 2000.  Then quickly moves on to show that Bush took several vacations right after he took office.  Whoop-ty-doo!   <br /> <br />Then it talks for about fifteen minutes about 9/11 never showed pictures of the twin towers.   <br /> <br />Then it begins talking about how G.W. Bush is somehow in league with the Bin Ladin family.  Whoop-t-doo!  His family disclaimed him a long time before the attacks.   <br /> <br />Then he starts making accusations about Bush wanted war with Iraq from the beginning of his term in office.  Who cares?  Sadaam needed to be taken out long before then.   <br /> <br />And after seeing recent evidence they have found evidence of Weapons in Iraq.   <br /> <br />Then after this he starts talking to a FEW disgruntled soldiers and their families.  Now I have family in the military and the military people I have met think it is right that our forces are over there.   <br /> <br />I feel that this film could have been done soooooooooo much better if they had shown both sides of the argument and actually given sources for where to find there so called evidence for their accusations.  Now I'm sure some things in the film are true but for the most part this film was nothing more than a Bush-Bashing Festival led by a crazy Lunatic.   <br /> <br />Now on the good side Michael Moore did do a fairly decent job of incorporating the segments taken from the news and making some segments of this film fairly interesting.   <br /> <br />But Most of this film was total B.S.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0679879269|4.0|(...)    These are books aimed at children and written in that vein. The heroine is a 12 year old girl (verging on 13). The books are couched in the fantastic and the allegorical. However, that is not to say that Pullman does not take his readers seriously. He is absolutely unflinching in his portrayals-including those involving violence and disappointment. These are the ways in which they begin to appeal not just to children (who so desperately crave to be taken seriously) but to adults as well. These books have enjoyed some astonishing success and they are well-deserved. Their influence on the genre will be in their presence-we don't think that many authors will attempt to imitate Pullman because they will be too timid to do so. He cannot be matched for how brutally honest he can be with the youth. It will be interesting to see how His Dark Materials will survive the test of time but because they are so antithetical to so many deeply entrenched \\"traditional values\\" we think that they begin to suffer a swift decline in future generations as the fear Pullman engenders in other authors will also be felt by parents when recommending books to their children.     WHO SHOULD READ THIS:    A difficult question to put to these books! Indeed, who should read them? Precocious and intelligent children should be introduced to His Dark Materials for they teach and celebrate simultaneously imagination, history, engineering, and physics. For many young readers, these books may be the first that seriously challenge their notions of justice, faith, and adulthood. There is such a great deal to admire about these books and parents trying to suppress them may in fact spur children in to reading them with greater furor. For wit, plot, and technique Pullman is certainly a match for anything Rowlings is doing (if not her equal in reaching larger audiences).     WHO SHOULD PASS:    Very conservative religious parents will be appalled by the last half of the trilogy. In fact, religious adults who read these books often complain of how profoundly annoyed and attacked they feel. Considered and educated readers will sense what we mean when we say Pullman's arguments become a bit facile by the end. Really, it's too bad--though how it could be avoided, we don't know--that His Dar Materials tackles the notions of faith in the way they do because in all respects they are very finely crafted and well-worth the time to read.     (...)
068987474X|2.0|When I initially read this book (the very day it was released in the bookstore), I was excited and thrilled.  \\"Finally!\\" I thought.  \\"A book teaching a different perspective!  Something that doesn't focus on playing games or being a b****.\\"  But after watching the Oprah show featuring the authors, I was very disturbed.  The man who explained his four tiers of women to the audience, Is he is supposed to be a typical representative of the male species?  It IS possible that woman in the fourth teir is aware of what her relationship is with him, and if they are both okay with that - it doesn't make either one of them a jerk or a player.  And what about the poor girl who told Greg that she was having a problem getting her boyfriend of 2.5 years to marry her?  Greg's response was \\"I'm sorry.  He's just not that into you.\\"  and then she began to cry.  Okay, so I'm a softy for that and my heart melted.  But really?  Is this what dating is about?  Whether or not a guy is into me?  Am I supposed to be the passive little female accepting dates from male prospects and waiting around always hoping if he's into me?  How about deciding whether or not I'm into him?  The big part of dating or any type of relationship is about boundaries!  We all have hang-ups, fears, emotional problems, etc.  Being successful in dating is all a matter of having good boundaries and knowing what you want, what sorts of behavior you will accept, where you draw the lines, etc and a having a little confidence in yourself doesn't hurt.  And maybe some of us do need a book to tell us if a guy is calling us at 2AM and asking to have sex with us and nothing else, then yeah, he isn't interested in having a relationship with me or if he says \\"I don't want a relationship\\" then that's what he means.  But I don't need a book telling me that every guy I date who isn't dying to marry me like a dog in heat, isn't that into me and I should just move on.  Relationships are work.  People are not that simple.  This bookis just another \\"Get Confidence Quick\\" scheme that teaches women some techniques that appear to the eye of the beholder that she is confident and has good boundaries with people.  As for this book, I'm \\"just not that into you.\\"
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I remember a certain magazine had the Beatles on the cover saying \\"Lost Beatles tapes discovered.\\"  Much of the lost tapes were during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.  Finally, the \\"new\\" release Let It Be... Naked comes out.  Is it an improvement over the original release back in 1970?  Yes and no (I gave the original release 4 stars when I reviewed it).      I prefer this version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" with Billy Preston's organ solo over the Spectorized version (I know I'm going to get some disagreements here for this opinion).  I also like this version of \\"I Me Mine\\" but it isn't exactly \\"naked\\" since the middle 8th and final verse are tacked on to keep the song over 1 minute (as many of you know, this was the last song the Beatles recorded together as an \\"existing\\" unit, sans John, back in 1970).  Also, this version of \\"Across the Universe\\" is an improvement over the muddy sounding version on the original release (and even an improvement over the version with the chirping birds) but it doesn't sound too different over the version on Anthology 2 (this song was recorded in early 1968).  Also, \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" the B side to \\"Get Back,\\" is included.  What's missing is John's wisecracks at the beginning of \\"Two of Us\\" and the end of \\"Get Back.\\"  \\"I hope we passed the audition\\" is a worthy way of ending that song.  Also, it would've been nice if the song \\"Dig It\\" were a few minutes longer and included (I read the original version was about 12 minutes long but that would be a little too much even for me!).  The remaining songs (save \\"Let It Be\\" which has George Martin's orchestra in the background swiped) don't sound too different from the original release, except that the mix is a little cleaner.  Also, the order of the songs threw me off a little bit, making it sound more like Scenes from the Let It Be Sessions.  4 stars    Now for the Fly on the Wall disk.  It's interesting, but probably not something you'll want to hear over and over again.  There areexcerpts of songs like \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" \\"Child of Nature\\" (which would later become \\"Jealous Guy\\"), \\"Taking a Trip to Carolina\\" written and sung by Ringo, a piano piece by Paul, \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Sun King.\\"  It also includes dialogue from the sessions by all 4 Beatles (there's a bit of it in the booklet, too).  3 and 1/2 stars    I was hoping they'd include what would've been the Get Back (with Let It Be and 10 Others album, but I guess Paul, Ringo and Glyn Johns didn't consider that worthy of release.  Paul had said in the liner notes for LIB...N: \\"If we had today's technology then, [Let It Be] would sound like this because that was the noise we made in the studio.\\"  That's a nice thing for Paul to say but John and George are no longer around to agree or disagree (though George reportedly did approve of this newer project before his passing away).  I'd like to see the movie Let It Be re-released.  It's a great movie, but depressing, because it shows how and why one of the greatest rock bands of all time split up.  One reviewer has said it's in the planning, let's keep our fingers crossed.
0143034448|4.0|This book was long, but I definitely enjoyed it. A couple of sections I skimmed over, but the heart of the story is compelling. I never thought of putting it down, mostly because, one of the main characters, Rebecca, fascinated me.  <br /> <br />Much like the author, I could not completely make up my mind about Rebecca. I had to find out what would become of her in the end. Even in the end I could not decide whether she was bad or simply had several bad circumstances occur.  <br /> <br />It was a good social commentary, and I am glad I read it. However, it is not a book I will ever pick up to read again partly due to its length, but also because once was all I needed. There were no overly complex ideas that warrant any more than a one time reading. <br />
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I was anticipating the release of this album, but simply refuse to buy it because \\"What Made You Say That?\\" is missing!!! That is the 1st song, which even got me listening to Shania Twain in the 1st place. Perhaps an import version will be released with this essential ingredient added!!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|A journey from the dark side of the moon, through the earlier days right up to the tolling of the division bell.    This concert is one classy masterpiece.     I cannot say enough about this concert. There is a certain maturity that comes through each rendition of the songs. Gilmour has clearly mastered each one. The audience is greete by a smile on Gilmour's face as they react wildly moments before each lead solo . His vocals (underrated) are excellent! This DVD picks up on that \\"performer to audience\\" interaction. I was especially pleased to see as many tracks from the \\"Division Bell\\" (under rated). \\"The Division Bell\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece itself. These new versions are just beautiful and Gilmour's guitar work is amazing. This is my all time favorite Floyd album simply because I have played it more and more often than any other and never tire of it. Do yourself a favor and pick that up with this if you don't already own it. There's just no denying  quality music and the finest at that. The unforgettable and haunting \\"High Hopes\\" is pretty powerful and showcases Gilmour's excellent slide guitar. \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" stands out as Gilmour softens it up a bit with the vocals and takes it home. There are some nice guest appearances such as Richard Wright as he performs \\"Breakthrough\\", a song from his solo album. It's a great song, and if you listen closely you will hear a familiar tune or two as it comes to an end (\\"home, home again\\").    A new edition to Floyd's song list titled \\"Smile\\" appears to be a direct message to Waters with lyrics such as \\"Would this do to make it allright?\\" - \\"Wasting days and days on this fight. You're sighing, you're sighing\\". The song has an acoustic country feel and seems to reflect on the bands earlier days. Tribute is payed to Syd through a number of song, one of which is an excellent rendition of \\"Dominoes\\". You cannot help but to reflect on Waters  on two, yes two renditions of Comfortably Numb (Robert Wyatt andBob Geldof taking his spot alongside Gilmour). This concert is a tribute to all who have supported Floyd in one way over another over the years.       This DVD was well put together with its multiple options and interactive menu. Included are a number of bonus features such as a highlight of Gilmour's guitar solos, home video footage and as well as some extra tracks.     Rather backwards from what most fans might say, is that the only thing I felt was missing from this was a song from the album \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" called \\"On the Turning Away\\". If not for that album, I might have taken a few more years to discover Floyd. My first recollection of them was seeing their \\"Learning to Fly\\" video on MTV. I introduced Pink Floyd to my parents (in late twenties now).     5 stars no question!!!    Awaiting the reunion...
B000255LNE|4.0|If music really can soothe a savage beast, this CD would have been all Van Helsing needed to get through Dracula - plus all his offspring, and all Dean Koontz heroes (from his man-fiddling-with-nature stories) would only need a CD player to end the story swiftly on a quiet note.<br /><br />This is a gigantic collection of ballads, with every slow Phil Collins song you ever (and never) heard of.  Even fans of Phil's would consider themselves full with two CD's of slow songs - a somnambulist's dream.<br /><br />You know most of the songs by heart, and maybe the perfect time to listen to this would be on a romantic evening with the rain falling softly outside.<br /><br />Warning: Do NOT listen to this album while operating heavy machinery, while driving on a highway, or while driving heavy machinery down a highway.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 11, 2004
B00005JMJG|1.0|This was the worse movie that I have ever seen.  It's pretty bad when you have to shut the movie off 30 minutes into it.  It just didn't go anywhere.  All this movie had going for it was all the great actors and I can't believe they risked their careers for such an awful movie.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Lots of good songs here. Some have been redone compared to the original versions such as \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\". The new songs are good too. \\"Party For Two\\", in two different versions are good but the pop version sounds better. \\"Ain't No Quitter\\" is a very country sounding song, sounding similar to her first release in 1993. Highly recommended at the low price its being offered.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Okay, so maybe Jennifer Lopez doesn't have the most potential voice in the world, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this is a bad album. There are several reviews saying that she can't sing and that she should stick to acting. Jennifer is a great entertainer and she did a very good job with this album. I personally think that this is her best album. It has many different kinds of sounds and rhythms as long as some beautiful ballads. This is a very complete album. It has upbeat catchy songs like \\"If You Had My Love\\", which is the first single and a huge hit; \\"Waiting For Tonight\\", which was also a big hit; \\"Feelin' So Good\\", one of my favorites, and others. It also contains ballads like \\"Should've Never\\", an excellent relaxing song with excellent lyrics, and \\"No Me Ames\\", another great ballad which she interprets with Marc Anthony in Spanish. There's nothing missing in this album. There's something for everyone. This is definitely Jennifer's best album. My personally favorite five songs are (in no order) \\"Should've Never\\", \\"Feelin' So Good\\", \\"No Me Ames\\" (ballad version), \\"Could This Be Love\\", and \\"Waiting For Tonight\\". I recommend this album to anyone. Hopefully Jennifer will release an album like this one again soon because her most recent album \\"This Is Me...Then\\" was not as good as this one or \\"J. Lo\\".
0767834739|5.0|I happen to love this movie.  I played the video games, but not enough to judge the movie based on the game.  First of all I couldn't beat the games, It got to confusing and I didnt' know what to do, so I gave up and played the second and third games.  Back to the movie.  This movie was a bomb.  In my opinion, this movie should be considered a Action film not a horror film.  I wasn't scared one bit.  The action of this movie was great.  I watched the first movie a milion of times.  It is a hot movie with action.  Stop comparing the movie to the games, and just compare it to the movie itself.  It's really hard to make a movie 100% on a game.  If you like action movies this movie is great.  I can't wait for it to come out.  There also making a 3rd movie, which I can't wait for too.
0140187537|5.0|After reading Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, and The Pearl in high school, I was not an admirer of Steinbeck, but when I picked up The Winter of Our Discontent as an adult, I was awed by the author I had once shunned.  Steinbeck's keen sense of character and a mastery of the language carries this novel from first page to last.  The story revolves around Ethan Hawley, a descendent of proud New England stock whose life seems betrayed by circumstances as he struggles to provide for his family.  His wife Mary urges him to be more ambitious, and his restless teenage children exhibit signs of being morally corrupt.  When Ethan decides that his ethics no longer matter in this demanding world, he enters his own compounding crisis.<br /><br />In perfectly rendered language, Steinbeck explores the themes of two Americas - the old Puritanical and morally staid one, and the one where every man fights for himself.  The corruption in New Baytown is rampant.  Issues about privilege and entitlement, family values, skewed priorities, flagging morality, and work ethics simmer underneath.  Steinbeck's depiction of Ethan and Mary's marriage is witty, biting, and affectionate, demonstrating both his humor and his talent for dissecting domestic issues as well as the grander, social ones.<br /><br />A fine novel by a recently underappreciated author, The Winter of Our Discontent is worth every minute spent with it.
B00004X01U|3.0|I tried to listen to Music by Madonna, but I was unhappy with the music.  I still enjoy Madonna's earlier cds that include True Blue and Like a Virgin.
B0006284JQ|4.0|The only real reason to buy this Cd is for her early stuff (first 2 albums). All her new stuff basically blows, with the exception of Toxic, which is one of her best singles ever. <br /> <br />1. Mr prerogative - kinda weak song, doesnt sound like she was meant to sing it (6/10) <br />2. Toxic - one of her best, probably the best club song of 2004 (10/10) <br />3. I'm a slave 4 u - the beat is really cool, it just goes downhill once Britney gets involved (7/10) <br />4. Oops i did it again - a song that brings back cheesy memories of grade-school, undeniably catchy (9/10) <br />5. Me against the music - just bad, sorry (5/10) <br />6. Stronger - pretty good, this was the last song of her \\"early years\\" (8/10) <br />7. Everytime - weak ballad, mainly 'cause she can't freakin sing ballads! without her army of computers to support her voice, britney flops on this track, she sounds like a child cooing (6/10) <br />8. Baby one more time - who can forget this? this made everyone pay attention, mainly because there was a hot 17-year-old bouncing around in a Catholic schoolgirl's outfit. a classic of the 1990's and one of the catchiest pop songs ever (10/10) <br />9. You drive me crazy - followup to Baby one more time, pretty good cheesy dance song, it would probably sound lame now, however (8/10) <br />10. Boys - this song always sounded like a cellphone ringtone to me, so it goes without saying that i thought it sucked (6/10) <br />11. Sometimes - classic ballad from Britney's \\"virgin\\" days, even though she had probably done every position in the book by then (9/10) <br />12. Overprotected - actually not a terrible song from her \\"new\\" period, mainly cuz it sounds like her older stuff (7/10) <br />13. Lucky - this is overwhelming poppy and cheesy, but not all that bad (7/10) <br />14. Outrageous - i hadn't even ever heard this song before i saw it on this album, so she gets a huge deduction for putting a non-hit on a greatest hits album (5/10) <br />15. I'm not a girl, notyet a woman - despite the unnecessarily long song title, this is actually one of her best singles to date. even though this isnt saying much, her voice has never sounded better than here (9/10) <br />16. I've just begun having my fun - wow, this is just retaded (and yes i purposely spelled retarded wrong) (5/10) <br />17. Do something - she apparently doesn't know how to go out in style. this album ends weakly (5/10)
B00005GL0R|5.0|The only thing wrong with this album is that it should have been longer.
B0006284JQ|4.0|This cd dissapoints me.  If there going to make a greatest hits cd for only 4 cds, which if you times by 4 because each artist makes an average of 4 videos per cd, equals 16 songs.  They better put every hit on.  Plus some bonus tracks.  After I listened to this.  I thought, they forgot two songs.  They forgot the \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\" and \\"From the bottom of my broken heart.\\"  In my opinion these were really good hits, even better than some of her hits that are on the cd.  Boys just gets old.  Those two missing songs, did better on the charts than Boys did including I'm not a girl, Not yet a women.  Did you know on the Mtv show \\"Trl\\" that those two songs (Boys and I'm not a girl...) got kicked off the top ten, and kicking off britney is a major shock for Trl.  Well, when I started watching it, \\"Don't Let me be the last to know\\" was on and it spent the majority in the top 5 falling out a couple of times falling to her lowest ever 8.  I believe her other ballad did the same.  Outrageous shouldn't even be on the cd.  <br />  <br />1). My Prerogative-A song that might get on your nerves, but it is a good version.  I don't get why people don't like it.  I give it a 9/10. <br />2). Toxic-One of her best songs lately.  10/10 <br />3). I'm A Slave 4 U-This song might get on your nerves, and It sometimes gets boring.  I give it a 8/10 <br />4). Oops...I did it again-A great old school song.  This song never gets old.  A 10/10. <br />5). Me Against The Music-A song that gets on your nerves.  The video is great, but the song doesn't catch your attention after listening to it so much.  8/10. <br />6). Stronger-A good song, that shows that she is stronger.  10/10. <br />7). Everytime-I happen to love this ballad, 10/10 <br />8). ...Baby one more time-The song that made her famous for her school outfit.  A great song 10/10 <br />9). (You drive me Crazy) (Remix)-Another great song 10/10 <br />10). Boys (Remix)-A song that she should have left alone.  I liked it at first, but now I don't really care for it.  The video is great, but the song gets on your nerves, shouldn't have been on here, 6/10. <br />11). Sometimes-I love this song, it's a great song. 10/10 <br />12). Overprotected (Remix)-The remix is good, but again gets on your nerves, 9/10 <br />13). Lucky-A great song, which talks about a girl who has everything but still crys.  Read the liner notes in the greatest cd to understand what this song is about.  Some people get the wrong message. 10/10 <br />14). Outrageous-Shouldnt have been on here, she didn't make a video for it, sort of, a 43 second video.  It didn't even hit radio really.  A song that gets on your nerves. 7/10. <br />15). I'm not a girl....-Another great ballad.  10/10 <br />16). I've just began having fun-Sounds like No Doubt's \\"Hella Good,\\" and is a great song 10/10 <br />17). Do something-Here this one out.  This is what Britney might sound like when she comes back.  Her beat and voice is different.  It's one of the best tracks on this cd.  10/10. <br /> <br />Again, number 18 and 19 should have been those ballads.  I don't know why they skipped them.  They had 20 minutes free of nothing.  I want to know who made this cd.  It really irratates me on why they didn't just add those other two hits, when they had 20 minutes free on silence.  The cd is only 60 minutes.  They bombed this cd, by not doing this.  Whoever made this must have not known that were her two singles, because how could you miss them.  She only has 4 cds out.  If she had 10 then it would be a different story, but only 4 with 16 singles.  Overall this cd gets 4 because of the missing songs.  Some songs get old and some shouldn't be on there.   <br /> <br />
B00005K3OT|4.0|This adaptation of Joanne Harris's novel lacks the seductive charm and magic of the original, but it succeeds on its own as a quiet film about a French village rife with personal crises.  When the mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), dressed in red capes, arrive in town on a day the wind from the North gusts open the church doors, interrupting the sermon on the first day of Lent, something begins to stir.  The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) knows it better than anyone.  Vianne opens a chocolaterie, serving up exotic confections designed to bring out the best in people, and relationships in the grim town shift.  Vianne seems immune to her own magic - until a band of gypsies and their leader Roux (Johnny Depp) set up camp on the edge of town.<br /><br />Director Lasse Hallstrom excels in his evocation of a small French village in 1959 and the people inhabiting it.  Despite its Swedish director, British author, and international cast, this film feels authentically French.  Its rhythms are mostly gentle, and its focus is on character rather than an intricate plot.  Juliette Binoche turns in a fine performance, even though her smile at times seems too vapid and easy for such a complicated character.  Judi Dench makes a memorable appearance as Vianne's landlady, a crotchety but spirited old woman who is estranged from her uptight daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss) and her grandson.  John Wood and Lena Olin also turn in strong supporting roles.<br /><br />Art house film addicts will want to see this, but more mainstream viewers may be bored.  Recommended for viewers who enjoy the leisurely unfolding of a quiet drama.
B000002NJS|3.0|I wish that I could like Ray of Light.  However, I truly feel that this cd is over-hyped.  I purchased this cd a year ago and now I find that I am unable to listen to it.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This has to be the saddest album I have ever heard. Every song is very melancholy and has a grey feeling to it. That doesn't mean that this album is a bummer. Despite the \\"on-the-verge-of-crying\\" vocals and sad lyrics; The music is very beautiful. Beck's song writing is top notch. I you get the feeling that he had to do some soul searching and could only express his feeling through writing and engineering music. It is not boring by one bit; little twangs and blurps that accompany the acoustics, slide guitar and the occasional symphonic sounds keep the ears happy and the brain stimulated. Not to sound clich' ish, but the sound is super colorful and full of brilliance. <br />Keep away if you're only looking for the quirky Beck; funky lyrics and catchy beats of ol'. Beck has not necessarily grown, but maybe chose to look at different avenues of expression. <br />I would recommend anyone who is a music appreciator to buy this album. I'm not by any means, a critic, but I really love to listen to all kinds of music (death metal to classical). I fell this is an album you can kick back in the bathtub, or do homework, or just chill out. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. <br /> <br />4 stars instead of 5 cause I dont think Beck is the most talented singer- he does a good job but does have a limited vocal range. I felt the singing didnt accompany the broad spectrum of the music and was shadowed. Maybe intended, probably not. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's sophmore album is something any music fan would enjoy.  I can honestly say it is better than No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls.  Their music has really matured with awesome guitar riffs and amazing harmonies.  Each song is very well-written.  On the flip side of the CD, there is a DVD of the guys making the record and a bit of other stuff.  This one is really worth your money!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's second cd, \\"Still Not Getting Any..\\" failed to disappoint.  While I still think their debut cd, \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\" is their best, this is a very exceptional cd to listen to.  My favorite songs are: Welcome to My Life, Perfect World, and Me Against the World.  I love them so much.  They're my fave band & they couldn't get any better!!  Plus, when u buy their new cd, it comes with a dvd also because it's a DualDisc (cd on one side, dvd on the other).  It has exclusive footage of the guys recording their album, photo gallery, & more.  Don't listen to the SP haters on this site or anywhere else!!  They don't know what they're talking about.  This cd is definetly worth $15.  So go out & buy their new cd & go see them live too!!  They rock!!  I LOVE PIERRE!!
B00003CXS4|4.0|Words can't exactly describe this film so perhaps this will sum it up: cockney criminals, underground boxing, and a big juicy diamond.   <br />Vinnie Jones & (the incredible) Jason Statham from \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" return and Hollywood top dogs Benicio Del Toro & Brad Pitt join the cast. Pitt (who once again is swinging his fists as he did in \\"Fight Club\\") is hysterical as Mickey the mumbling Irish gypsy. Word to the wise: before starting the movie, go to the subtitle options and select \\"Pikey, what did you say\\" so you can understand what Pitt is saying through his jumbled speech. <br />\\"Smoking Barrels\\" was great but \\"Snatch\\" blows that movie out of the water. It has more action, more humor, a surprise ending and of course, a terrific cast.  I love watching British crime & caper/action films and \\"Snatch\\" is one of the best to cross the pond. <br />
B000667GFK|5.0|This is Luis Miguel at his best, his voice bids you to escape from the mundane world.<br /><br />Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan are the best mariachi in the world.<br /><br />Every song is super great. The arrangements are fantastic, with all of the guitars,<br /><br />trumpets, and strings executed perfectly and beautifully, and the recording quality is excellent.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This album, like most retrospective works, is great if you are a moderate fan of U2.  It is hard to argue with any of the songs on here.  But if you are a true fan of U2, you absolutely have to buy the albums.  The 80s were when they did their best work, and all of the albums from the era are classics.  As has been stated, U2 is an album band - their albums have great continuity and one constant sound throughout (different on each album) which is taken away by the presence of only the best hits.  And, as hardcore fans will tell you, some of U2's best work is not their singles hits.  Running to Stand Still and A Sort of Homecoming are two perfect examples - you cant fault them for not inluding them on this CD because they weren't hits, but they are songs you should own.  Finally, greatest hits albums love to truncate the songs, which destroys them.  Where the Streets Have No Name with a shortened intro?  Terrible move.  But this CD is nonetheless a collection of great work, and hardcore fans should buy it for the B-Sides CD.
0140277447|4.0|I can see the headlines in Japan depicting Iris Chang's suicide as evidence of her guilt in writing a book full of so-called \\"lies, exaggerations and half-truths.\\" However, I choose to remember her as a crusader whom in a note to her family, wanted to be remembered as someone who was \\"engaged with life, committed to her causes, her writing and her family.\\"  Thank you, Mrs. Chang for being the voice of the voiceless.  Thank you for holding the Japanese government accountable for their atrocities.  And finally, thank you for writing such a powerful and historically significant book that I will eventually pass down to my children so that they will never forget what happened.  Rest in peace, Mrs. Chang, rest in peace.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is an outstanding portrayal of Homer's epic even with major deviations from the original Iliad.  This adaptation captures timeless issues related to diverse reasons soldiers go to war, their loyalties, and the impact on their loved ones.  Brad Pitt excellently shows Achilles' transition from empty self-absorption to humanity, and Eric Bana is outstanding as noble Hector.  All supporting cast are exceptional.  The movie portrays the greatest individual battle scene ever (Achilles v. Hector) which is emotionally tied to the reactions of Hector's loved ones. The moving scene with Achilles and Priam alone is worth seeing this extraordinary film.  An epic - best movie of this genre and Oscar worthy.  Don't miss this film!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|If George is your favorite Beatle then this DVD is for you! <br />In this tribute concert you'll find an atmosphere full of mysticism, nostalgia and good rock & roll.

0425152251|5.0|This is a book that EVERYONE must read before they die, regardless of who they are or what they've heard about the book or what preconceptions they have about this book. <br /> <br />It is not just recommended for people who are interested in philosophy or different ways of thinking. I read it when I couldn't have cared less about what philosophy was, and it changed my life forever. <br /> <br />I am a Christian (after three years of exploring) and I am tempted to rate this book as higher than the Bible ... I am the person I am today because of this book ... it made me give up Christianity, go on a search for what was actually true and real, and then after three years of intense study and exploring and examining different philosophies, finally becoming a Christian again (this time for wise reasons). <br /> <br />I am 20 years old (I read Sophie's world when I was 15) and I am looking to hear from anyone who found this book as amazing as I did (not just because of the plot, or because it tells you about philosophy, but because of the first questions that Sophie gets asked which make you realise that you are alive, and mortal), preferably someone who lives in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (or is planning to visit somewhere near where I live). My email is enchantress42@hotmail.com. <br /> <br />I will warn you that this book might save your life also ... but when it does you will be so thankful and will never want to go back to your old way of living anyway.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|I felt the advertisements for this movie were very misleading.  It showed the character Marie in the trailers, but she was only in the movie for a few minutes.  There was no charming conversation or chemistry like in the first movie.  Pretty much a solo mission.  So I subtract one star for that.  Also, I felt the story was week.  Although there was plenty of action, it could not compensate for the lame story.  The ending seemed depressing and out of character.  So I subtract another star for that.  Then I also agree with the other reviews that complained about the camera shaking.  Once in a while is OK, but not through the majority of the movie.  I subtract a 3rd star for that.  It was definitely a one time watch and would not hold up under repeated viewings.  I don't think we should blame Matt Damon though, I'm sure he thought it would be a good movie and as an actor, he was at the mercy of the director and the editor.
6302491940|5.0|I remember seeing this movie on TV when I about 9 years old, yet I still remember it 30 years later.  That's more than I can say for the re-release, which I saw at the theatre recently but can barely remember now.  This movie preceeds a lot of the cliches we're now familiar with.  Michael Caine is great as the lead character, and the ending is non-conventional.

B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is hype and inappropriate. Seeing blood and gore from the moment the movie begins until the moment the movie ends is not what Christ was all about. Love, compassion and forgiveness, that's what Jesus is about not this portrayal of his last days on earth. Are the masses really asses? I guess so, if they truly believe this is a good movie, or for that matter a heart moving movie.  <br />I suggest seeing \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\", or \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" These movies represent excellent acting and a portrayal of the life of Jesus that is accurate and complete. The Passion shows the agony but no ecstasy and that's it. Those who know the bible know what Jesus went thru on his last days on earth as a man. Depicting only the gore is not necessary and uncalled for. Anyone can chop out a moment of time out of context and call it something more than what it is. And that is what Mel Gibson did here. <br />

1563898586|5.0|With The League, Moore shows that he can put aside the overt socio-political concerns that take centre stage in some of his other writings (From Hell, V for Vendetta) and construct as good an adventure story as anyone else in the comix genre. However, as Jess Nevins' indispensable Annotations can attest (which are freely available on the Internet), there is still a tremendous amount of depth and referentiality here. This is a simultaneous homage and indictment of the nineteenth century: a paradoxical time of innocence and exploitation. Moore, as usual, proves why he's the best, by doing what others don't. Foreign languages (Arabic, Chinese) are written in foreign characters, and clever puns and double entendres are generously sprinkled throughout the text. He also cuts and pastes some of the more famous storylines of the era and reinvents them to suit his purposes. The narrator's affectations completely nail the tone and attitude of the era. A book is never just a book with Alan Moore; he always stretches the limits of the traditional graphic novel, introducing such elements here as a novella, games, and biographies of people having nothing to do with the narrative.        Truly, the artwork here is nothing short of amazing. Kevin O-Neill's colours brilliantly match the flow of the narrative, running the gamut from drab to dazzling. His full-page illustrations are immaculately detailed and very pleasing to the eye. O'Neill is no mere comix illustrator: he's a full-blown artist. His ability to effortlessly move from the abstract to the concrete is remarkable.     Pick up this book. As bizarre a conceit as a 19th century version of the Justice League of America stacked with England's more famous fictional heroes/heroines of the time merits a look. The fact that it's Alan Moore quarterbacking this experiment makes things all-the-more interesting.
B000646MNE|4.0|Yeah, Sarah exec.prod's, but this is a show that couldn't survive without the other 3 gals. YET, it is SARAH'S face and figure HOGGING the label side of ALL OF THE DVDS. Can you believe that? Sarah is such a prima donna, she won't let ANY of the other cast members have their face on even ONE dvd!! Yeah, like you're hurting for the cash and exposure right, honey? Not only THAT, but Sarah's character is the WHINIEST and the WEAKEST of the four. And unlike Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha she is the only cast member who did NOT do a nude scene. Otherwise, this is a GREAT collection. I LOVE nearly EVERY episode. What's sad is that none of the girls could be bothered to record a commentary track, so that's a slap in the face to SATC fans. The few commentaries that are included are pretty good. Oh, and be careful handling the cases the discs are housed in - one of mine is starting to come loose. One of the greatest shows ever!!!    After having seen the bonus material for season 6.5, I would love to DOCK this set one star for FALSE ADVERTISING. The pitch that there are 3 \\"alternate endings\\" is BOGUS. SATC fans, were we not lead to believe that there were different bona fide endings filmed for the final episode? Instead, what is seen is merely a few changes to the same scene in the coffee shop. SHAME ON WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DECEPTION!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|So you hate the band, then post one goddamn review and be done with it! seriously, this guy has posted at least, AT LEAST 10 reviews on this album already. All dissing them for things that they had no control over such as the iconic \\"downfall of music as we know it\\" [boo hoo, no more metal *sniff* David Lee Roth along with all his other testostrone-driven womanizing, gay-bashing friends are all washing cars for a living now, how terribly tragic] When Nirvana ended a whole new crop of musicians sprung up: wannabe grungers. These bands lacked anything that the real grunge bands had. But wait, who's fault is this? Nirvana's? Pearl Jam's? hardly. if anything it is simply the stupiditiy of youth. A lot of the bands influenced by grunge simply didn't get the real messages conveyd in the songs. they lacked passion and instead opted to rip off these bands and cash in. To blame ANY one grunge band for this is just plain ignorance. They ALL had a part in it, but you cannot blame the creater of a peice of art for how people react to their work, that's totally irrelevent. So AFI K James, instead of being all obsessed with how Nirvana fans love and praise them [well DUH of course they will] why not get a hobby? try collecting stamps or perhaps making coasters out of your old CDs. Don't feel bad that your music got overshadowed by greatness. just get some balls and get over it.
B000002H97|4.0|This is a good album, so dont get me wrong, I'm just saying that in Kill, Lightning, Puppets, and Justice there was the top knotch songwriting and complex song structures. In this album the band simplified their sound, making this one of their most creative albums yet. However, this album doesn't live up to its predecessors at all, its just too different. While Metallica were thrash in the eighties, now they're just, well, metal. This is still a heavy album, its just no thrash, and Metallica basically were the first ones (along with Slayer) to create thrash. Some songs still remain to have the speed and velocity of the old Metallica, but others tend to slow it down a bit, much like 'Nothing Else Matters'. The opener to the album 'Enter Sandman', is a great song, it just has some goofy lyrics, but the guitar work is still very good and so is the drumming. Oh yeah, did I mention that you can now hear Jason Newsted's bass playing? Remember back in the JUSTICE days where the production was so bad you had no idea what was going on with him? Well now you can hear every second of his talent, plus one for Metallica. Songs like 'Sad But True', 'Holier Than Thou', 'Through the Never', 'The God That Failed' and 'The Struggle Within' still maintain the heaviness of the old Metallica, with blazing drums, fast riffs and shattering solos. The ballad 'The Unforgiven' is also a pretty good song, not as good as 'One', 'Sanitarium' or 'Fade to Black', but still great and still has the powerful guitar work. Other non-standout tracks like 'Of Wolf and Man' and 'My Friend of Misery' are often overlooked, people, they are good songs, just not as stand-out. Overall this is still a great album, even if it was a step down from the first four.  <br />  This was Metallica's final great album before all hell broke loose with LOAD, fortunately five long years would pass before that. But Metallica had no idea that this would be their undoing.

But Hands Down The Best Song & Main Reason To Buy This Cd Is For Josh Groban's \\"BELIEVE\\" That Is Beyond Words!!!
B00012QM8G|3.0|I think making Liam Neeson break down at the end and cry like a WIMP completely ruined what was an otherwise fine film. Spielberg just CAN'T stop his hackneyed emotional manipulation, and I had to turn my face in embarrassment when Schindler starts weeping like a baby. UNBELIEVABLE. The black & white cinematography is superb. The recreation of the horrors then were quite convincing. You would think that given the subject matter, Spielberg would FINALLY relent and record a commentary track. But no such luck. His problem is that he can never \\"get his story straight\\", and thus would stumble with his multitude of contradictions. Want an example? Close Encounters. He, the DIRECTOR, gave differing accounts of how he got the little boy to react inside his house when he hears sounds at night. Look it up, you'll see.
B00005YW4H|5.0|With a sensual, slik voice and perfect arrangemtn, Norah Jones' debut release shines.  I am not usually one for \\"soft jazz\\" but this one has truly taken my breath away.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Amazon are selling this album for $13.50. <br /> <br />You wanna know if its worth it? <br /> <br />Here is what i would pay for each track (considering singles go for about $5): <br /> <br /> <br />AIRBAG: at least $15 <br /> <br />PARANOID ANDROID: $25 <br /> <br />SUB ALIEN: probably $15 <br /> <br />EXIT MUSIC: $25 <br /> <br />LET DOWN: $25 <br /> <br />KARMA POLICE: $10 <br /> <br />FITTER HAPPIER: $5 <br /> <br />ELECTIONEERING: $10 <br /> <br />CLIMBING UP THE WALLS: $15 <br /> <br />NO SURPRISES: $15 <br /> <br />LUCKY: $20 <br /> <br />THE TOURIST: $20 <br /> <br />TOTAL: $200!!!!!!! <br /> <br />This may seem ridiculous, but this album is seriously worth 15-20 others. <br /> <br />It will last you a lifetime. I've owned for 7 years now and i still hear something new every few listens.  <br /> <br />Its an album you will never grow tired of. <br /> <br />OK Computer is so good, that i often see it in record stores and get tempted to buy it again. <br />again! <br /> <br />Just to have that amazing sense of discovery.  <br />That feeling, and knowledge, that I'd stumbled upon something as perfect as this. <br /> <br /> <br />and you have.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Not much to add to the other positive reviews. This is a favorite goofball flick and fits in neatly with a lot of the wonderfully screwy stuff that was being made in the mid-60s like \\"The President's Analyst,\\" \\"The Great Race,\\" or Bava's dazzling \\"Planet of the Vampires.\\" Something others haven't noted though: this film's story is set in deep winter and the sense of intense cold and bleakness is overwhelming, almost physically painful. I've never encountered a movie that conveyed these qualities so well...and so relentlessly. It's a darned good thing it's a comedy otherwise it would have left audiences comatose. Watch it on a sultry summer evening or otherwise make sure you've got plenty of blankets and hot chocolate (and a good fire going) otherwise you run a serious risk of getting frostbitten! What a brilliant setting for a vampire flick!
B000089CPF|4.0|Feast of Wire bends the alt. country genre, literally past the border!  <br /> <br />Swelling with Mariachi horns and latin rhythms, this monster of an album really is a veritable feast!  <br /> <br />Calexico kicked around for years testing the waters and playing with their border crossing sounds until finally providing the album of genius they'd always been capable of.  <br /> <br />Its got country, folk, mariachi, salsa and even jazz at times. But it maintains a gritty alterantive ethic the whole way through.  <br />Its got plenty of twang, but doesnt fall into any genre traps or monotony. The variety is constantly engaging, yet the album has a fantastic coherency.  <br /> <br />Calexico are expanding the musical palette of alternative artists in the south, and are melding their very own brand of Americana.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I wasn`t sure of watching it, but now I`m glad I did. It`s romantic not beeing chesse, it made me lough, but it`s not a comedy. The characters are very well developed, and very loveable and that makes them seem very real. <br />I like the karaoke scene, then it`s when they really express their feelings about each other, with the songs. <br />To me, they don`t make japanese seem very well,  but it is in a funny way, I`d like to listen a Japanese opinion about it, to see if im right. <br />Anyway, I recommend it a lot.
B000002KO3|5.0|Where is the line between rock and funk?  <br />dance and punk?  <br />drone and rhythm?  <br /> <br />Remain in Light bridges gaps like no other.  <br />An exceptionally dense album, merging funk rock and punk ethos with african rhythm and art lyrics.  <br /> <br />Always engaging, with its group vocal choruses, masses of polyphonic percussion, amazing and peculiar delivery from David Byrne, and a plethora of treated instruments filling out (and sticking out!) in each of the songs, this is not only Talking Heads' perfect album, but a true 'one off' original in pop history.
1591840562|2.0|I was given a complimentartu copy of this book, so thankfully none of my hard earned money was wasted. If you want to learn about starting a company there are dozens of better books than this one. Like all of Guy's books, this latest one is just another collection of banalities which will only impress the ignorant.
B000002UB3|5.0|John Lennon was once critised for the lyrics to \\"I Want You\\", due to their simplicity.  <br /> <br />The Lyrics to the song are, admittedly, quite simple:  <br /> <br />I want you  <br />I want you so bad  <br />(she's so heavy)  <br /> <br />yep. thats it.  <br /> <br />But John explained that when you're drowning in a river, you don't shout to the people on the shore:  <br /> <br />'Excuse me ladies and gentlemen. I seem to be having a little bit of trouble swimming in this current, and it appears that im slowly being dragged under. Would one of you kind folk be so kind as to jump in and attempt to save me?'  <br /> <br />you shout:  <br /> <br />'HELP! HEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPP!'  <br /> <br />The point is,  Abbey Road was an album that, to a large extent, shed the experimentation of the Beatles psychadelic phase, and the almost 'stream of consciousness' approach to the 'White' album, and concentrated on being the tightest collection of perfect rock songs you'll ever here.  <br /> <br />Straight up, unmasked, raw prowess.  <br /> <br />The Beatles best work. (Though  Revolver has a few things to say about that!)
6305609705|5.0|A truly outstanding film by any standards, and in the wake of so many articulate reviews it's hard to add much, beyond giving it further well-deserved praise.    I have always considered AN to be a true Art Movie in the classical sense, and the combination of inspired direction, production, casting, cinematography, screenplay, you name it, almost puts this movie out on its own.    Yet there were a few questionables even in this work of genius. For one thing, it is unlikely that an unsupported Game Warden PBR crew would be interdicting suspect sampans with an important G2 (Army Intelligence) cargo such as Willard on board. It is also unlikely that he would have been entrusted to a crew that was so openly cracked. Still, it makes for a good movie.     If they had to deliver an operative of Sheen's obvious caliber way up river, they would do everything to minimize the risks, not be pulling over junks that could be full of VC, who could lob a satchel charge on board, trigger a Soviet-model Claymore (directionalized fragmentation mine, with a wide kill vector) as the vessels closed in, or just simply pull out AK-47's and RPG's and try to shoot it out, once the weapon arcs of the fifties had been degraded by proximity. i.e. if you're too close, you can't maximize your superior firepower. (Plus, cornered VC would have nothing to lose by firing RPG's point blank.)    Equally, when Kurtz talks about the 'strength' it took for the VC to cut the innoculated arms of the children in the village he had passed through, this is a very misguided belief. If a group of women, with children of their own could do it, it might have been strength. What he saw was the result of cold, masculine detachment. Callousness is not strength.     While it's possible to go beyond this and list various technical flaws, it would be mere nit picking, and the movie deserves better than that. Overall, it succeeds mightily, and remains one of the best Vietnam movies yet made, and one full of memorable characters.    Anybody who thinks that Robert Duvall's Kilgore character is an exaggeration, doesn't know the Air Cav. You had to be crazy, wonderfully crazy, to do what they did, day after day, from the Slick (Huey) pilots to the Snake Drivers (Huey Cobra). The superb Duvall played the role of a lifetime as Kilgore, and he was just about dead on - most of the guys still wear their Stetsons to this day.    If you have never seen this movie, you are in for an incredible experience. I still keep going back to it every few months and amazingly, it never dates or loses its impact.    Look out for Harrison Ford as Colonel Lucas, the Intelligence Officer near the beginning. What a cast.
B000002U9W|4.0|Pink Floyd have unfortunately developed quite a label in peoples eyes as being outdated 'dad' music that deserve a place only in the world's 'classic rock' radio playlists.  <br /> <br />This album is proof a something much more.  <br />This album is the best thing Pink Floyd ever recorded!  <br /> <br />This album opens with a 24 minute epic (the title track) the moves through several different movements, including a climactic reprise filled with a full orchestra, and a massive celebratory horn line.  <br />The track delves into some of the first experiments with 'electronic' music, with smooth synths, tape loops, gurgles and blips.  <br /> <br />The other tracks range from slow and spacious, dreamy pop numbers that hint at the beginnings of 'space rock' and what Spirtualized has been trying to mimic fro the last 10 years, to a simply pucked folk number by Waters, to another psychadelic epic to finish the album.  <br /> <br />A wonderful exploration of Pink Floyds diversity and potential in their early years.
B000000OTU|5.0|I really like this cd because it has many Aerosmith classics within.....Like \\"LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR\\"....AND \\"RAG DOLL\\"........all you need to do is listen to the samples.....and who knows?......You might like it.........sigh....I'm drifting away...............................
B000003S5H|4.0|Picking up where Serge Gainsborg left off, Air produced this gem in 1998.  <br /> <br />Its not groundbreaking, but its definitely one of the most soothing listens you can get.  <br /> <br />The songs on this albums bounce along with such confidence and sensuality that you can't help but be sucked in.  <br /> <br />Full of sultry sonics, pattering grooves, warm horns, and perfect production.  <br />The heavily treated vocals on most of the tracks add to the spacey nature of the disc. You'll seriously be floating away in a frenchy kinda way!
B00005JMAH|1.0|After watching the movie and reading all the reviews I felt I had to write a review.  The movie was not made for the children that are the loyal fans of the Harry Potter books.  Infact most young children would be frightened by this movie.  It was more of a horror flick instead of a Harry Potter movie.  The movie was not true to the book.  As other reviewers have noted the castle and Hagrid's hut have changed.  When you are watching the movie you feel like you are some how in the wrong movie because it does not look familiar.  It was a disappoint for anyone who loves the books and wanted to see them put onto the screen as they were written.  The first 2 movies felt right because they were true to the books.  They, as one reviewer put it, matched the images the books created in your head as you read the books.  The 3rd movie was a jumble of unfamiliar scenes and familiar characters who were not put together correctly.  The underlying story was not the same as the book because major bits of information were left out or moved to different times in the book.  The head master was played by a new actor who lacked the aged wisdom and seriousness that the character showed in the books and in the previous actor.  The new actor seems more comic than wise.  It felt really wrong.  I really hope they fix this problem in the next movie. As the reviews showed older viewer seemed to enjoy the movie more because of its faster pace and more horror flick feel but the true Harry Potter fans were not happy with the new look and feel of this movie.  Harry, Ron and Hermoine need to be dressed in school robes not blue jeans.  That was weird.  I think I was so caught up in the fact that the sets changed and the clothes were wrong that I could not enjoy the film.   <br /> <br />If you want to see Harry Potter's world as written in JK Rowlings books don't buy this movie but if you are into more of a Horror flick Harry Potter than this movie is for you.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the culmination of 10 years or so of Jeff Tweedy testing the limits and potential of country tinged music. It is brimming with hooks, still holds the odd bit of twang, yet takes the sound into the 21st century with an array of sonic and electronic arrangements. Songs range from brooding, slow yet instrumentally chaotic burners to pulsing pop rock songs, all maintaining that element of acoustic twang-rock.  <br /> <br />Think about Radiohead doing country. F*cked up, twisted inside out, but rewarding beyond measure.
B000001DTM|5.0|I love all these wanna-be Rolling Stone employees, with thier 15 paragraph reviews and fancy words they had to look up in the dictionary. <br />Here is my review for Achtung Baby - best u2 album made. <br />But what does my opinion really matter.  The album is 13 freakin yrs old.  If you haven't bought it yet then I doubt you'll be running out tomorrow to get it.... <br />
B000066HI4|5.0|Bonnie 'Prince' Billy (aka Will Oldham) creates the scariest take on country music imaginable. In fact, this could easily be labelled 'goth country'.  <br /> <br />His lyrics are intensley personal and his voice a deep and dark wonder. His songs are carefully crafted and arranged in an obscure warmth and frailty.  <br /> <br />On some occasions the songs creep along steadily, on others errupt into soaring climaxes of double tracked vocals on the brink of collapse. These climaxes don't play on the usual tricks of severe dynamic change or string sections, but rather involve escalations in emotive force that ripple through you.  <br /> <br />Will Oldham is a master songwriter, and an expert at creating sound collages and textures not usually associated with country music.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Excellent compilation of Shania's most popular hits from The Woman and Me, Come on Over, and Up! albums.  PLUS 3 new terrific songs.  A must have for any Shania fan and for anyone interested in finding out about Shania!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This album is an overflowing, glacial storm that soars like no other.  <br />Tracks full of rumbling bowed guitar and orchestration that wil give you goose bumps.  <br /> <br />The vocals are the most surreal, androgenous, alien falsetto. They'll literally shove beauty down your throat!  <br /> <br />An absolute masterpiece full of spook and grandeur.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I can get rid of the taped from TV VHS copies now.<br /><br />This is great!
B000068FY1|3.0|The Jayhawks were one of the bands who got the whole alt country thing on the road, and that really is what they're good at.  <br /> <br />Hollywood Town Hall is a perfect driving album. The songs are all short and punchy pop rock numbers with just the right amount of countrification.  <br /> <br />\\"Take Me With You When You Go\\" and \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" are both classic tunes with the very slightest inclination of despair. In fact, all of the songs on this album are relatively easy listening but certainly stand up to repeat listens.  <br /> <br />The Jayhawks provide a clear illustration of how simple songs can have lasting value.
034537410X|5.0|This book contains a wide variety of techniques for lucid dreaming from different esoteric traditions.  The essence of one's success with lucid dreaming though, IS, intention to dream lucidly.<br /><br />You may be surprised with how many things you can accomplish just like that by beginning with a state of mind that it is easy to accomplish, that it is natural for you to accomplish it, intending the effect and expecting it.<br /><br />It may take you more time to experience lucid dreaming if you have never invested any effort to work intentionally with your subconscious mind, but on the other hand, if you are experienced working with self-hypnosis, you may find yourself having a lucid dream just by reading through the book because it would plant a suggestion in your subconscious.  Perhaps you have already had experiences where you watched something on TV just before going to sleep and then dreaming about it; or reading something before going to sleep and then dreaming about it - it can be as easy as that.<br /><br />And yes, the practice of conditioning your mind to be aware that you are, even now, awake in your dream - works.  Again, if you have never engaged in any spiritual practice, or working with your mind, it may seem that there is a distinction between the \\"dream\\" of your waking life (the time when you believe that you are fully awake) and the dreams you dream during the night - but if you'd engage in creating outcomes intentionally in your daily life with your mind - your daily life would soon begin to feel like a dream, just a projection from your mind - one moment you think about something - and the next moment you experience it in your outer reality.<br /><br />There is a distinction, though - as you'll find yourself able to do certain things while dreaming with your physical body asleep, which you are not able to do with your physical body - such as fly - so any such unusual experiences can serve as a wonderful \\"cue\\" to alert you to the fact that you are dreaming and help you to become lucid.that you are dreaming and help you to become lucid. <br />
B000267JQK|3.0|This album, Disclaimer II, is the re-release of Seether's original Disclaimer album with a few bonus tracks added. Thus, as other reviewers have mentioned, if you already have the original, there really is no point of shelling out the full amount of money for THIS album. But anyway, the bonus material is overall decent with a few questionable tracks like \\"Out of My Way\\" and \\"Take Me Away\\" (well, the chorus, anyway). And I wasn't a big fan of some of the original songs either, especially \\"F It\\"; and the music in \\"Sympathetic\\" tends to drown out the singing.<br /><br />The real disclaimer that this album should entail is how lengthy it is: 77 minutes. There's nothing wrong with extra songs, but EIGHT? That's a bit much. They could have left off the aforementioned tracks that I didn't care for and kept the new version of \\"Broken\\" (with Amy Lee), or else take off THAT song and leave some of the OTHER bonus tracks. There IS such a thing as too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Like I said before, Disclaimer II is best purchasing if you don't already have the first Disclaimer. If you do, then just rock out to THAT and download the bonus tracks.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
051788710X|5.0|At the time I read this book for the first time - I have particularly appreciate the section that deals with working with nightmares and the simple and true statement that \\"nightmares are unfinished dreams\\".  The book provides practical methods that work with \\"finishing the dreams\\" and effectively stopping the nightmares - and it works.  Sometimes, though, the appearance of a nightmare may call for some active action in one's daily life, instead of just \\"finishing the dream\\" and this book does further provided methods for getting insights into the messages that dreams are attempting to communicate.<br /><br />This books is a rich resource of techniques and numerous case histories to inspire you not only to explore your dreams but to embark on wild and wonderful advetures, beyond anything you may have thought about before.
0399230033|5.0|This was the first book for kids that I bought, and even though I don't have any kids yet, it doesn't matter because it is such a wonderful story.  Although there isn't a lot of text, the pictures make up for it!  I honestly have to admit that even as an adult, I find myself reading this book over again.  The pictures of the animals are so cute, especially when they're trying to hide in the bedroom!
B000089RVX|5.0|Orginially, i bought this album for the single, Bring me to Life. But that is actually not the best song on the album in my opinion. Whisper or My Last Breath are two of my favorite songs, although Imaginary and Hello are good as well. I honestly cannot wait until this group releases a new album. This group is definetly a keeper.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie was incredible! The person from GA who wrote that this was a \\"horror flick\\" is absolutely WRONG! HELLO! Kids like to be scared a little. That's why these books and movies are so popular. There is no excessive violence here. That's what the ratings are for. Where are your examples of \\"horror\\" unsuitable for children? <br />As for things being a little different, that's the nature of films over books. Everyone's imagination is different, so there will never be any full compromise here, but overall, the director and actors did an awesome job of translation. It was all so vivid. <br />Kids in real life grow up and have different stages in their lives through adulthood, why shouldn't fictional characters? If some readers don't like this type of writing, then read elsewhere because that's just what Ms. Rowling is doing, simulating a REAL LIFETIME, not some sort of Charlie Brown perpetual childhood (which is ok, but not what's going on in these stories). <br />The people that are complaining that this is too mature, horror-flickish, etc. are probably the same one's who don't want their kids having access to proper sex education or protection, then moronically freak out when they get pregnant or get STD's. Just because you don't talk about it or don't like it, doesn't mean it's not happening. More moral hypocrisy! <br /> <br />Rent or buy this movie! You will not be disappointed! It delivers!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I came upon this band expecting some wannabe punk band but they really suprised me. they are harder than i thought they would be. my chemical romance sounds really good. and this cd sounds really great, from what i have heard ( and i do plan on buying this album) they rock.
0743454529|5.0|Until I read MY SISTER'S KEEPER, PLAIN TRUTH was my favorite of Ms. Picoult's books.  But not now.  MY SISTER'S KEEPER is absolutely the best book she's ever written.  The subject matter is difficult, yes, but it will make for spirited and lively discussion among friends and in book clubs.  But aside from the moral issue explored, MY SISTER'S KEEPER is, above all, a beautifully told story with characters that wrench your heart.  Much has been said about Ms. Picoult's ability to pick a controversial and timely subject for her books, but that's not why I read her, and I don't believe it's why her legions of fans read her.  The bottom line is, Ms. Picoult is a marvelous story teller.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0001I561E|4.0|This is a really fantastic movie but it has been ruined for me on the DVD release.  Everything is so PINK!! The colour transfer is terrible.  For good picture quality, keep your Laser Disk version. Otherwise the package was very good - especially the song videos.
0743454529|4.0|The protaganist is Anna, a teenager who was conceived primarily as a donor for her older sister who has recurrent cancer. Anna decides to sue her parents for the right to make decisions over her own body. Each character's actions and thoughts are represented in a way that creates compassion, rather than judgment.  As a mother, I read this wondering \\"What would I do?\\" especially knowing what I've already been through with my youngest daughter (not cancer-related, but a serious ongoing health issue nonetheless). No easy answers here. The only reason why 4 stars instead of 5? The ending. It just didn't flow well with the rest of the story and seemed as if the author was on a time schedule to get the book to the publisher. Jarring. But it's definitely worth the read!
B0006284JQ|4.0|Britney is hot. She is hot from day one. She is hot and professional. Or maybe because of it. Just look at her eyes, in the \\"baby one more time\\" video clip. She knows. And that makes her a superstar.  <br />the problem is that she is too young. And was way too young when she got into this business. She will not be the next Madonna, not for lack of charisma, but for lack of strengh. She had no time to really build something on her own. And although she claims to be stronger, that it still not enough. <br />That's for the person. Now comes the music. She starded working with Cheiron production. A team of 20 people living in Sweden, a place when there is no sun 9 month out of ten (i'm only exagereting a little bit...) and where you have to make the joyiest music as possible. And that's what depressed and teenager people wants ! I love that music (although i'm nor depressed, nor a teenager, but only a straigh guy who likes to dance !), it makes me happy. And i don't care about the stupids lyrics. Only the beats matters.  <br />After Cheiron production she worked with several other producers, never finding a new style. Although it suits her well she will not be as succesfull as she was in the beginning, if she still produce music that it's not recognizable as hers. And that's for the future ! <br />Now she's doing a cover. About her prerogatives. She publishes her wedding pictures + long interview in a magazine. Then does a video clip with her then not yet husband in which she kinda simulate a wedding. All this seems reaaaaaaaaaaaaally toooo calculated. Don't get me wrong, the calculeted thing is part of the business. And it's ok. But only when it's well done. But that's not the case in here. This is marketing at its worse. sad ending for the pop princess.  <br />But as i first said, she is a superstar and if she finds a new musical identity, I thing she will rebound and I, definitly, will be buying her music.
B00007E8V4|3.0|System of a Down will be releasing 2 full length cds in 2005.  the first one will be called Hypnotize, which will be released in March.  the second one will be called Mesmerized and will be released later in the year.  The long awaited follow-up to Toxicity is almost over.  And now for the review, this cd is ok it could've been better I ecpecially like the first half of the cd and the rest is just ok.  I don't own this album (thats right I stole it) and I'm glad I did because I normally listen to there self-titled cd than any of there albums.
0440237688|4.0|Lois Lowry is a great and imaginative writer. She writes with an opened mind. Which is a very good thing. Having a opened mind lets you explore and imagine anything. The Giver was a great book all except the ending. The ending is like a big drop off. The ending is ambiguous and lets you think what happened insted  of it telling you the real ending. I do like the fact that you get to pick your own ending you to your liking. The one thing that you need to have is a good ending or the reader wont remember the good parts only the last part which was a \\"Bad\\" ending. The sequelscame out a long time after the the first book. Those books made up for the \\"Bad\\" ending that you had read. Over all the book is Great and i would recomend it. <br />                        <br />                                  Sencerly, <br />                                       The Giver Reader
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I first saw this movie with my girl friend when it first came out. I pissed my pants, and couldn't stop laughing for weeks to follow. I have since bought the books and can't wait 'til Friday (11/12) for part 2 to come out. I have read the book, and can't wait what parts they will keep and take out. But do look forward to the Thailand stuff.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I don't know who put Britney up to the top-heavy cover photo, but they redeemed themselves with the nice black-shirted photo in the CD's liner notes (this photo should have been on the cover!).  Despite this pictorial mistake, this compilation of hits was wonderfully put together...with all of the fun, high energy tracks all together, and the slower tracks making a good filler in between.  I am glad they put remix versions of CRAZY and BOYS on this....they are so much better than the original versions!  The opener, MY PREROGATIVE, certainly grows on you after a few listens...and the closing new material DO SOMETHIN' and I'VE JUST BEGUN are great future hits.  Finally, the bonus disc is full of good remixes of songs featured from IN THE ZONE....especially TOXIC....which I think is my favorite Britney song!  So, if you are a new fan, or an old one, this compilation is definitely for you!
0375701427|4.0|Like no other country, America's greatest writers periodically produce wide scope, zeitgeist state of the nation novels that attempt to encapsulate an entire social commentary in one novel. For me, the best of these is Tom Wolfe's 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. But American Pastoral comes a close second. In this novel, Roth lavishly rips apart all that is wrong with orthodox, prosperous, middle class American life by telling the story of Seymour Levov 'The Swede', a Jewish, blonde, handsome high school athletic hero who marries Miss New Jersey, inherits his father's glove factory and settles down to domestic idyll in Old Rimrock, New Jersey.<br /><br />What goes wrong? Everything. The Swede's daughter commits an atrocious act of political terrorism and the Swede's comfortable life is savagely blasted apart. How can this happen? The novel concludes with a rhetorical question- 'And what is wrong with their life? What on earth is less reprehensible than the life of the Levovs?'. What indeed? Roth goes into great depth into answering this question over the course of the preceeding chapters. He draws out the snobbery, narrow mindedness, peer pressure and teenage rebellions of affluent Americans with characteristic rich, subtle prose. The characters are portrated realistically and sympathetically. By the end of the novel, one is left in no doubt as to why The Swede's life went so catastrophically wrong. This probably is Roth's masterpiece and probably deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it was subsequently awarded.<br /><br />Is it flawless? No, it could do with some judicious editing at times as sometimes the luscious, hard hitting prose is over verbose. But what editor would have the balls to go through the manuscript of such an established Writer as Roth and suggest swingeing cuts? And I am not an unconditional fan of the way Roth portrays the Jewish dimension in the novel. This is an important part of the plot, as the Levovs are a Jewish family, envious of WASP goyism. But at times I sense that Roth has somewhat of an axe to grind and his attempts to portray the anti semitism prevalent in East Coast America slightly distort this aspect of what is otherwise a brilliantly drawn and executed novel.But at times I sense that Roth has somewhat of an axe to grind and his attempts to portray the anti semitism prevalent in East Coast America slightly distort this aspect of what is otherwise a brilliantly drawn and executed novel.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|When I first saw (as we all did) the Apple iTunes commercial, I heard the guitar rifts of \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and I was like WHO does that song?  WOW!  I told my wife sitting by me... that was the greatest sound I have heard in like ten years.  The last time I was this excited over a band's sound was with \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana - before that, \\"Appetite\\" by GnR and maybe you could add in \\"Moneymaker\\" by the Black Crowes.  That is a stretch of nearly two decades with only a handful of bands that could made my soul and my gonads tingle.  I asked all over and no one knew the name of the group on \\"that iTunes commercial.\\"  One day the radio played the whole freakin' song and then announced the group's name... JET.<br /><br />I was at Wal-Mart and they had the whole album new for $7.99... eight bucks for ONE song?  Sure, for this one, but oh, was I surprised... the WHOLE ALBUM rocked!  No, it was not a Motley Crue \\"Too Fast For Love\\" non-stop headstrong album, but much more with poignant ballads nicely interjected to give one a chance to catch one's breath, pause and reflect.  REFLECT?  What is THAT?  I thought the purpose of rock albums nowadays was to numb one's mind.  Sure, there are the occasional radio hits, now and then, but almost all CDs you buy nowadays end up being a total disappointment with far too many \\"filler songs.\\"  As a result, those fillers created the demand for the a-la-carte online music market, but NOT \\"Get Born.\\"  You will want to listen from the beginning to the end without editing out a single song!  Tell me, honestly, when was the last time you played a recently-produced CD that wasn't a greatest hits or compilation that you did THAT?  I can't remember many.<br /><br />Jet's songwriting influences are incredibly transparent - like a well-mixed smoothie... you enjoy the totality, but savor all the different ingredients.  Take The Beatles (in their later years) for your base... add in some AC/DC, Kinks, Zeppelin, Ramones, ELO, Clash, BTO, Tom Petty and a touch of Black Crowes to round it all out and you basically have \\"Get Born.\\"  Wow, with ingredients like that, no wonder \\"Get Born\\" tastes so damned good.<br /><br />I won't bother critiquing each individual song, because in order to get the full \\"Get Born\\" experience, they all need to be heard sequentially, in their entirety with the telephones turned off... LOUDLY.  Be alone, act silly, stupid, dance like a 12 year old and have fun... catch your breath and be emotionally moved like an adult and do it all over again.  That sounds like GOOD SEX to me or maybe it's just good in-your-face, raw, hard, fast emotional ROCK AND ROLL - either way, it's something we rarely get anymore.  Jet's \\"Get Born\\" releases all your inner emotions, feelings and desires in one 48 minute CD... less than a one hour mind-numbing (\\"The Factor\\" excluded) TV show.<br /><br />There is NO excuse NOT to buy this record... it flat-out rocks, so fellow rockers, fear not, don't give up hope... \\"there IS another\\" after all... \\"Get Born\\" again with JET.<br /><br />Ted in Gilbert, AZTO, Tom Petty and a touch of Black Crowes to round it all out and you basically have \\"Get Born.\\"  Wow, with ingredients like that, no wonder \\"Get Born\\" tastes so damned good. <br /> <br />I won't bother critiquing each individual song, because in order to get the full \\"Get Born\\" experience, they all need to be heard sequentially, in their entirety with the telephones turned off...

068987474X|5.0|I was skeptical at first about buying this book, as it's co-authored by two Sex and the City writers, not by licensed therapists. After reading mostly positive reviews of the book on Amazon, I bought it. Boy, am I really glad I did!<br /><br />Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo aren't psychologists, but their insights on male/female relationships are both hysterical and extremely perceptive. You don't need a degree in psychology to understand that women deserve to be with men who treat them with respect and love, and not to waste their time on men who don't.<br /><br />It wasn't just the content that hooked me, but the way it was presented. Different relationship scenarios are described in detail, using a \\"question and answer\\" format in the guise of women writing to Greg looking for advice on their love lives. It was truly amazing how right on target the scenarios were, almost scary.<br /><br />I don't agree with his assertion that only men should the pursuing, though. Some men may need some help getting out of their shells, so to speak, and leaving it all up to them might lead to nothing happening at all. Some reviewers have said that Greg's point of view is chauvanistic. I didn't see that at all. As a matter of fact, I saw the exact opposite: all he really did through the book is encourage the reader to make the right descisions for herself and her well-being. How can that be bad?<br /><br />I just got out of a 6-year relationship, and a lot of what they had to say resonated with me. Instead of lamenting on what \\"could have been,\\" I'm taking the steps necessary to move on with my life. It helped me realize that I deserve to be with someone who *truly* wants to be with me, and not to \\"settle\\" for less.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this little book completely changed my life; after all, it's written by a comedian and a writer, respectively. However, it did give me the extra encouragement to learn from the past and have some hope regarding my adventures in the always-unpredictable dating universe.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|if you're the type of person that buys albums after reading a lot of hype without having heard any actual music (i.e. those who own albums by elefant, stellastarr, etc.), then this album is for you.  beyond calculated, it's like somebody conducted a focus group on what's popular in indie rock and came up with this.  take \\"Neighborhood #4 - 7 kettles\\" for example, the album's painfully awkward \\"dance track\\", undoubtedly a response to the focus group's finding that dance-y stuff is currently \\"in\\".  the album's song titles outdo even coheed and cambria in pretentiousness.  the whole endeavor is a virtual homage to the city of omaha.  do yourself a favor don't buy this garbage because you will think it's a masterpiece for 36 hours and then never listen to it again.
0920668372|5.0|The other day I was at work (I work in a daycare with preschoolers and kindergartens.) and I decided to read one of the little girls a story. I was tired of all the seasonal books my supervisor picked out so I went over to a shelf and pick out this book because it had a cute cover. I proceeded to read this story and ended up almost in tears by the end. As a mother-to-be I thought this was an outstanding book and I want my children to know that i will always love them. (I probably won't rock them to sleep untill I die, however I did learn from my little sisters that even 11 year olds want to be rocked.)
B00030590I|5.0|I loved this movie,and found myself swept away by the imagery and sheer beauty of the characters,and the way that the director used color to convey the mood of the various scenes.If you are looking for a \\"bruce Lee\\"-type film,you will be disappointed,although all the actors are very accomplished martial artists.It was just a beautiful film,and I fully intend to buy it when it comes out!

B0000013G9|5.0|This is one of the best love/R&B albums ever put out, hands down. Listening to this album sometimes is one of those you listen to because you are crazy about a girl, and just can't get her of your mind, therefore listening to this and only making it worse, but besides that, this album is worth every cent. My favorite songs would be Creep, Diggin' On You, Case Of The Fake People, Red Light Special, Waterfalls, Let's Do It Again, If I Was Your Girlfriend, Take Our Time, and Switch, so I guess every song is good. So go out get this album and get even more crazy about someone.
B0002ZMITY|5.0|Having seen the \\"Ali G\\" movie before seeing the show seems to have given me a different perspective than most.  Instead of comparing the movie to the show, a different comparison took place: a similar type movie came out in the States, called \\"Malibu's Most Wanted\\" starring Jamie Kennedy, and next to this movie Ali G shines.  So go out and see this movie, expect some 'campiness', and you'll like it.

0451450523|5.0|I am a huge lover of fantasy but this was just something else all together. It had traits of a fantasy but it was just so much better than just any fantasy novel. I love unicorns also which has something to do with why I just can't stop loving this story. I watched the movie when I was younger and if you've ever seen it you must read the book! You won't be sorry you did. It captures you and draws you in in a way I've rarely experienced.If your like me and love unicorns and fantasy this will quickly soar to the top of your list as one of your all time favorites!
B00005JNEI|1.0|The only reason to see this movie is to laugh all the way through at the pompousness of the Hollywood brain trust and in particular Michael Moore, who has the nerve to submit this for a Best Picture Oscar.<br /><br />Oh, and one more reason: Moore's phony hate-filled Leni Riefenstahl-style agitprop handed john Kerry his defeat.<br /><br />The sad part is, when Moore was doing TV Nation and satire like \\"Canadian Bacon\\" he managed to make some points, and even with \\"Stupid White Men.\\"  Then he climbed on the George Bush is Satan bandwagon--he must have booked a double seat.  I would actually look forward to his upcoming expose \\"Sicko\\" and its commentary about health care if I hadn't been soured by Moore's propaganda and his constant savaging of Americans abroad in the British press.<br /><br />Michael Moore says Osama is Bush's best friend...well, in one sense, he's right, and he can count himself in that camp.  Both of them helped re-elect Bush.  The man who claimed to be a documentary filmmaker (his so-called warnings about the entertainment value are fake, he's hoping everyone will take the film as fact) can't face reality himself: the overwhelming majority of us \\"stupid Americans\\" voted for Bush.  Without even a Supreme Court decision!<br /><br />Somewhere there is still artistic and philosophical merit in Michael Moore, and as an American he has a right to express his views.  Unfortunately for him, we do too, and we did on November 2, 2004.

We are in the midst of a war against terrorism where Islamic fundamentalits seek to erase our western culture from existence.  Over the next few centuries, it is either going to be us or them.  If it means blowing up the Holy Land, we're gonna do it!  If it means invading and liberating Iraq, which is the epitome of Arabic militarism, we're gonna do it!  Thank God Bush was re-elected, because if Kerry pulled us out and Iran became nuclearized...it would be a tremendous victory for global terrorism.  Moore doesn't realize that the best defense is usually an aggressive offense!!

0312995423|2.0|Wow, where to begin.  This is the second Dan Brown book I've read and I'm guessing it'll likely be the last.  To begin, if you plan on reading this book, forget suspending your disbelief, rather tie up your disbelief, take it out back and shoot it lest it resurface while you're reading the book.    Yes, this book contains an impressive amount of plot holes, factual errors, non-existent technology, etc.  The NSA (which is in fact bigger than the CIA and the FBI) is portrayed as an organization with no more than perhaps 20 employees, none of whom come in on weekends.  Employees with 170 IQs who act as if they had a 70 IQ.  12 gauge printer cable?  The NSA has full-time employees that work as translators -- they don't hire temp college professors to read Chinese/Japanese.  Programmers/mathematicians DO NOT MAKE an exorbitant amount of money working for the NSA -- they are still subject to the federal payscale.  X-eleven, not 'X11'?  Brute force code-breaking as the primary decryption method?????  VSLI, not VLSI???  Tracer programs which don't have to be executed, but act on their own? Ugh.    I can overlook these things if they appeared in a well written, taut storyline.  In his defense, Dan Brown doesn't include a preface to this book espousing the accuracy of the books' general facts as he does in the prefaces for Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code.  So you have to take it as FICTION and not non-fiction.  He does claim to have corresponded with former NSA employees during his research for this book.  Having a bit of experience in the industry, I would say that either Dan Brown had no such correspondences with former NSA employees, they fed him misinformation deliberately, or Dan Brown was informed the basis of his entire book was nonsensical by these former employees, so he decided to throw all their suggestions in the trash and continued to write this book anyhow.    Regardless, the ultimate downfall of this book is BAD WRITING.  The characters are flat and annoying.  Their actions are contradictory to their personalities -- for no other purpose than to move the 'plot' along.  I think Dan Brown has a Word-a-Day calendar and he uses that new vocabulary word several times in the 10-15 pages of writing he produces that day.  Words such as 'andalusian' are used several times in a 3 'chapter' span and then never again surface throughout the book.    Most frustratingly, Dan Brown apparently never learned similes are functional and get the point across, but should not be used often as they can be extremely annoying and counterproductive to getting a point across.  Towards the end of the book all these sentences are seriously used in less than 2 full pages:  - \\"The commander rose through the trap door LIKE Lazarus back from the dead.\\"  - \\"Freon was flowing downward through the smoldering TRANSLTR LIKE oxygenated blood.\\"  - \\"Susan was standing before him, damp and tousled, in his blazer.  She looked LIKE a freshman coed who'd been caught in the rain.  He felt LIKE the senior who'd lent her his varsity sweater.\\" [nice double simile, huh?]  - \\"Her gaze was LIKE ice -- the softness was gone.  Susan Fletcher stood rigid LIKE an immovable statue.\\" [another one]  \\"The puddle of blood beneath Hale's body had spread across the carpet LIKE an oil spill.\\"    Believe it or not, there are more in this 2 page space, but I'll stop here.  Yes, the writing is THAT groan-inducingly bad.  These two classics in the book make me laugh every time I think of them -- \\"Like in a cheap hollywood movie, the lights went out in the bathroom just as she heard the scream,\\" and \\"any more interesting than last night and I'll never walk again.\\"    Ultimately, I did finish the book -- one reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  A small reason was because I hate leaving a book half read, but I finished it more so to see how much more ludicrous the book would become.  There's a good premise in the book, but a better writer was needed to coax it out.  Dan Brown is not that writer.

0767903862|4.0|My title refers to a quote from a biologist regarding that most unusual of all Australian creatures, the platypus. The quote is symbolic of the entire book for me, in that it tells the casual reader little by itself, but forms part of the overall tapestry of odd facts, trivia, stories, and downright weird vocabulary that together make this book a delightfully entertaining, informative, and insightful read.<br /><br />In preparation for this book Bryson visited Australia several times, and covered an amazing (some would say crazy) amount of territory, most of it far, far off the beaten path. I greatly admire his characteristic ability to put interesting sights into historical perspective, although in my mind, he never really did answer the conundrums he posed early in the book about the Aborigines. I particularly enjoyed the sections devoted to the amazing ecosystem of Australia (and the subsections on the amazing number of things in Australia that can kill you), the number of silly museums and sites (\\"The Big Lobster\\") Bryson visited, and most charmingly of all, the seemingly endless topic of curious (if not downright eccentric) people that call themselves Australians.<br /><br />This is a great book, which I recommend highly to anyone interested in Australia. My only minor critique of the book would be its occasional redundancy (I understand it is hot, and that the Outback is large after the first one hundred or so mentions, for instance), but this is a small price to pay for an otherwise exquisitely entertaining travelogue.<br /><br />I have always wanted to visit Australia, and after reading this book, have redoubled my resolve to go there (despite the number of things waiting there to kill me.)
6305327041|3.0|After the first 15 minutes of this movie, I considered turning it off so I wouldn't regret wasting an hour and a half of my life.  But before I had a chance to turn it off, two fairly attractive women take their shirts off.  That convinced me to leave it on a little longer to give it a chance.  And I was rewarded.  The humor in this movie is definitely dark and odd, but stories number 3 and 4 in this movie are great.  Quentin Tarantino breaks out with more impressive dialogue and the movie ends with a bang.  I could never really figure out Tim Roth's performance, however...it reminded me a little too much of Mr. Bean.  But I guess that's how all British people act, right?  Ha.  Just kidding.  Anyway, this movie is worth a shot for Tarantino fans and people who like strange movies, but not for people expecting a laugh-out-loud hilarious movie or one that follows formulas.

B00006LSM3|4.0|This is a terrific final offering from peace-fulfilling George Harrison. There is a true sense of impending death here, only a sense that such death is a mere transformation, one which Harrison sublimly celebrates. I particularly appreciate Any Road (\\"...if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there...\\", Pisces Fish (\\"I'm a Pisces Fish and the river runs through my soul...\\") and the closer Brainwashed, where Harrison rolls through a litney of social pariahs. Beautiful posthumous album from a beautiful musician.
B000002BBY|4.0|The songs from this album were written long before Oasis became a houshold name, they were written at the same time the tracks for Definitely maybe were written (91/92), they just decided the best stuff should go on their first album Def/Maybe and the rest would be released in a 2nd album - Morning Glory! Worth remembering when you consider the material in Morning Glory and the success it has had and is still having. <br />The songs from these 2 albums are about being unemployed and living of the dole which is why nothing like them has been written again and probably never will.  <br />This album is quality and those who say songs like Hey Now! Cast No Shadow and She's Electric let it down aren't seeing the whole picture. They show the diversity that the band can reach and that they don't always take themselves as seriously as some might think. Its not Definitely Maybe which I would give 5 stars but its their own fault for releasing such a great debut in the first place that the follow up was always going to be under immense scrutiny. <br /> <br />Being a Brit I normally peruse the .co.uk site but needing some info on some American bands I thought I'd check out the .com side. Purely by chance I noticed a link to Oasis stuff so thought I'd have a look n see how Oasis are percieved over in the big ol US of A these days.  <br />It seems like the chance for the boys to make it big over there have gone and fair enough, Liam deciding 5 mins before the MTV unplugged set that he had a sore throat probably didn't help (I was hugely disappointed too!) but don't hold this against them if you get the chance to see them live TAKE IT. They are amazing live and have repeatedly won/been nominated for 'Best Live acts' etc more so since their supposed downfall! Yes I am harping on about them a bit but if you've ever been to their gigs you would too. <br />And one final word, I've read several other reviews and they are all pretty accurate and fair but something they most definitely are not is COCKNEY, who Derek Mok incorrectly points out in the first page of the reviews. Just so no newbies think these guys are from London and speak with a Lock Stock n Two Smoking Barrels 'alright geeza' tone they don't. They are from Manchester and they speak with a thick Northern Mancunian accent!  <br />I thank you.
B000063COX|5.0|Man, all I hear from these other reviewers is how great Piece of Mind is or other albums with Bruce.  Give some credit to their first album.  Not to mention Paul Di'Anno, who I think was a better singer for Maiden.  Sure Bruce has a better vocal range, but Paul, damn, he had attitude.  His voice sounded so cool.  I really liked his voice in Prowler.  He just howls to the riffs.    Now the music.  Prowler, now this is an album opener.  How can you people say that Aces High, or The Wicker Man is better than this?  This is one of my favorite songs by Maiden.  Don't get me wrong, I love Aces High.  But Prowler is such a great song.  The opening riffs made with the wah pedal just blow your mind!  The singing goes so well with the music.  The chorus is so cool, you'll be singing it for weeks.  Then it leads to the solos.  Man, they're nice.  Fast as hell but simple at the same time.  This is not a complex song.  Aces High is much more complex.  But doesn't mean its not good.  Such an underrated song to the new generation of Maiden fans.    There are some tracks here that aren't exactly spectacular like Sanctuary,Remember Tomorrow, Running Free,Charlotte the Harlot and Iron Maiden.  But I still like these songs and always will.  Sanctuary is good but just doesn't deliver as much as Prowler.  Remember Tomorrow is a great change from slow to fast, I really like the bass in this song.  Running Free is just punk like all over.  The bass intro followed by the drums is just such an enjoyable beat.  The chorus is catchy as well.    Phantom of the Opera is my second favorite song done by Maiden. This song just shows how technical their music can be.  After the first solo comes in, you know you're gonna be on a wild ride.  The instrumental section is where the song really shines.  The riffs backed up with the bass in this song is just amazing.  If you don't like this song, but you like songs from the Bruce era, you're an idiot.  This album is worth the price for Prowler and Phantomalone.  I can't get tired of this song.    I used to think Genghis Khan was better than Transylvania, but I really just had to give time to see which was better.  I still like Genghis Khan, its just that Transylvania gives off such a better atmosphere.  The riffs and solos are fast as hell, how can you not love this instrumental?  Better than any Metallica instrumentals.  The Call of Ktulu is nice but Transylvania kicks its ass.  Not to mention Maiden doesn't stretch out their instumentals to 10 mins pointlessly.    Strange World is a nice little break after Phantom of the Opera and Transylvania.  Paul's vocals are really nice here, even though he sounds as if he's been [...].  The music is awesome and is played as a blues type ballad.  Very nice.  Charlotte the Harlot isn't a standout.  I like the intro.  But the song just doesn't appeal too much.  I like 22 Acacia Avenue a lot more than Charlotte the Harlot now.  Acacia is just thought out better and is a little more deep.  The title track is simple, it has no solos but is fun as hell to sing along to.  The riffs are cool.  This is the only track on this album that I think is overrated.    I still wonder why the hell Burning Ambition was released as a B'Side on the Running Free single instead of on this album.  That song is truly incredible.  It is short (2:42) but really good.  The solo is f*cking awesome.    This album has no fillers.  2 incredible songs, 2 great songs, and the rest are still good.  Don't call yourself a fan and start wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts if you've never even heard this album and Killers before.  The raw, garage sound on this album are the roots of Maiden and are very unique.  You really need to give the Paul Di'Anno era a try.  It's truly amazing.
B0000CABJ1|3.0|Donna Summer is one of the most underrated artists of the past three decades and a prime and very sad example of how record company interference can destroy a career rather than nurture exceptional talent. Because talented, Ms Summer certainly is ,with one of the best voices (still) in the industry, exceptional songwriting skills, and that talent has also branched out into other spheres such as art and writing. What one cannot take away from her however is the impact she has had on the pop world and this incomplete collection provides further testimony, that coupled with the fact that although their hasnt been a new studio recording since 1994's Christmas Spirit album she remains an important celebrity. That said, however, it is a wasted opportunity and here in South Africa this collection hasnt even been released probably because the last collection \\"Endless Summer\\" is still readily available.  <br /> <br />What would have been an ideal opportunity to create a more 'updated' collection including the hits that are never mentioned from the 80'S \\"There Goes My Baby\\" #18(RSA)and top twenty I believe in USA, \\"Dinner with Gershwin\\" #13, \\"Eyes\\" Woman in Me, and from 90's \\"When Love Cries\\", \\"Melody of Love\\", \\"Whenever there is love\\", \\"I Feel Love 95\\" at least they managed to include \\"I will go with you Con Te Partiro\\" <br /> <br />Like most loyal fans I purchased this purely for the three new tracks 'Your So Beautiful', I Will live for Love, and Thats the Way produced by Giorgio Moroder, and the three stars awarded are for these tracks alone, overall a dissapointing collection and someone of Ms Summer's stature deserves far far better treatment.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Considering that this CD is a Greatest Hits CD, it was actually worth my money.  I own all of the Britney CDs, but was glad I bought this one.  The bonus songs were great.  I actually had the song, \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" because I bought In the Zone at Wal-mart and it was a bonus hit.  I didn't know about the \\"Do Somethin\\" song and was excited to see it included.  I also was excited to see that it was a double CD with the extra CD having the remixes.  I only wish that the Greatest Hits CD had included the song, \\"The Answer\\" that wasn't released on the U.S.'s In the Zone CD.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This is an impressive movie. Don't think it reproduces \\"The Illiad\\" of Homer. It is just \\"based on\\" it. Well, the movie humanizes the story, that's what it does. And \\"hollywoodizes\\" it too! And we can even notice some made-for-purpose resemblance between Agamenon and Mr. Bush. We all want the whole world under our hands, don't we?! The attitude towards this movie has to be: just seat down and enjoy!   The visual effects are magnificent. Eric Bana is perfect. Great actor. He should get an Oscar for this role. When Achilles was calling for him outside the walls of Troy, I trembled just by looking at Banas frighted face! Peter O'Toole is great too. Something must be said of Brad Pitt as Achilles: his dramatic performance is not good, but his physical performance is incredible. The fight between Achilles and Hector, I have to say, is the most beautiful I have ever seen on the screen. An impressive ballet.  The movie is long, but you don't even feel it. It is very well compassed. I've seen it 3 times. Can't help it!!!! If you enjoyed Gladiator, surely you will enjoy this one too.
6304698623|3.0|I'm not going to rip this film to shreads like some more disgruntled fans. First, I'd like to say that \\"A Little Princess\\" is my favorite book from my childhood. I love it still today. Basically the only thing this movie had in common with the book is the names were the same. That was about where the similarities end. They completely changed the plot, the characters, and the ending. The reason I gave this three stars, because I thought it was alright as a movie and shouldn't be rated as compared to the book for this review. For the time, the graphics are good. It's heartfelt, if not overacted. The friendship between Becky and Sara seems genuine. The movie is a lot more warm and fuzzy than the book. I didn't really like the movie, but their were several parts that were satisfying and the ending was good.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is, without doubt the best romantic movie I have ever seen. It has everything you could possibly want in a romance, even though at times it can be very sad. I do recommend watching Before Sunrise first, not because you really need it, but because if you do and you like it, you will enjoy Before Sunset even more. <br />I'm sure everyone pretty much knows what this film is about. Two people who met 9 years ago on a train and spent a night together meet again on his tour for a book he wrote about their time together. The movie happens in real time, so during eighty minutes they walk and talk around Paris. Beware: this is all they do. Walk and talk. This is a film for those who like to listen. And they do talk about pretty interesting things. But the film is not for everyone; a lot of people find it annoying. It is for the more mature filmgoer, for people who want to have some kind of insight into human relationships.
B000002KO1|4.0|When looking at \\"solo albums\\" from Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson and Debbie Harry, one might ask, \\"When will Chrissie Hynde make a solo album?\\".  One might, but not if one were a Pretenders fan. Because, as all Pretenders fans-and unfans-know, all Chrissie Hynde's works since the first two Pretenders albums are, in fact, solo albums: she simply calls whatever bunch of people she's hired \\"Pretenders\\".  <br /> <br /> At one time, The Pretenders really were a band, no matter what Chrissie says: in her early days she had no money to pay Pete, Jimmy and Martin a salary, so some consensus had to be reached. And the current arrangement seems, to this fan of the original Pretenders, a little disrespectful to Pete and especially the great James Honeyman-Scott, who was _the_ Guitarist Behind The Girl-much more so than the technically competent but vanilla-metal oriented Neil Geraldo or the innovative-thinking but totally chops-bereft Chris Stein.  <br /> <br /> Here is the Straight Stuff-the raw undiluted Pretenders Band. Chrissie, Pete, Jimmy and Martin, four imperfect but determined scruffs working it hard as they can because this might be their only chance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and learn.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I could write some long, involved review....but why?  this album is like ALL his others: sublime.  elliott, your music will be greatly missed.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This is the ultimate Britney Spears CD. It contains all of her hits and 3 new songs. Most of Britneys albums had great songs, but the majority was filler. What made me the most excited was that it includes the Stop Remix of \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" and the Darkchild Remix of \\"Overprotected\\". The news songs are some of Britneys strongest. Alot of people dislike \\"My Prerogative\\" but I like it alot. \\"I've Just Begun Having My Fun\\" sounds alot like No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\" and it's excellent. One of Britneys best. \\"Do Something\\" is also excellent. My favorite track is the Chris Cox Megamix of all of Britneys hits. The bonus cd contains high energy remixes of her hits from \\"In The Zone\\" and the I really liked the remix of \\"Everytime\\" It's much better as a dance track than a droopy ballad. It's a must have for Britney fans and anyone who never bought her albums because they only liked her songs from the radio.
B000023VR6|5.0|The Chronic 2001 is probably the best rap album ever made.  There are so many sick tracks.  The CD helped launch Em's career too.  Dr. Dre is amazing and the most amazing rapper, producer etc. ever.  <br />Sickest Songs: <br />1. What's the difference? <br />2. Still D.R.E. <br />3. Watcher <br />4. Big Ego's  <br />5. Xplosive
0385512104|5.0|I hesitated before writing a review on this gem, because so many others have before me already. However, it seems few parents of autistic children have submitted reviews. As one of those, the book has a special appeal to me. Make no mistake, the book is brilliant in itself already, but somehow it allowed me to better fathom how my little boy must look at this bewildering world around him. I read the book in one night and ordered ten copies the next morning to give as a present to my family and my best friends. The best novel I have read in years.
B0006284JQ|5.0|So what if her world tour turned out to be a fluke and In The Zone didn't live up to all of its promise, I doubt Mrs. Federline-Spears gives a damn.  To be honest, a greatest hits album from this teen pop alumni actually proves quite an accomplishment.  Why?  Well, let's be real. Did all of you cynical, pop music bashers really expect Britney to make it this far in her career? Weren't you just waiting for her to become the next one-hit wonder those six years ago as she strutted down the halls in a naughty uniform teasing all who watched?  I believe you know the answer.  Although many of you might beg to differ, Spears really is this generation's Madonna. *Gasp* Yeah, I said it.  Tabloid exclusives, naughty TV performances, songs about sex and wild partying, all the while flowing over delectable dance beats and wafer-thin vocals.  Madonna blazed that trail, and Spears is simply walking it, but fans and haters alike cannot deny the pop power Britney possesses.  Four albums deep ain't that bad, and her slew of number one hits deserves a proud display.   <br /> <br />With its aesthetically pleasing packaging, plus a bonus CD of remixes and several unreleased tracks, \\"My Perogative\\" is a must have for hardcore and even casual Britney fans.  The tracklisting follows no chronological order, which is somewhat of a dissapointment seeing as how Britney's progression from bubblegum princess to club savvy freak-a-leek gets lost in the mix.  Regardless, it's all here.  While many of her earlier up-tempo songs haven't aged well, what with the emergence of edgier, more street oriented dance styles in recent times, her ballads are still timeless and to be honest, they were never given their proper due. <br /> <br />The new songs are nothing to quiver and scream about.  \\"My Perogative\\" a remake of  Bobby Brown's hit song, is funky, teasing, and pleasing and gives a great glimpse as to where Britney is now- musically at least...  \\"Do Somethin'\\" is all brovado, street sass, and a junky electro mish mash that all comes together in the end- even though it does sound VERY similiar to Gwen Stefani's current single. <br /> <br />And there it is, a recollection of Spears' short ride over pop culture.  Some of it still sounds great (namely the hot dishes Neptunes cooked up for Britney), some of it sounds dated (namely the singles from Oop...I Did It Again!), but overall it's worth the price of admission.  For those who think this signals the end for the pop diva, think again... I have a feeling she's only started...
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a great film! The people from the Academy Awards and those at the Cannes Film Festival can't be wrong, even Ebert & Roper agree, Michael Moore is a great documentarian. Before you start bashing the movie please realize that a documentary doesn't necessarily have to be objective. Some are confusing documentaries with journalism. Although a documentary can strive to be objective there are no rules prohibiting a director from presenting a subject matter from a certain perspective. Some Americans are so lazy, they expect everything to be presented to them in a way in which they don't have to think. Come on people wake up and use your God given brain. And please people, do read the news; don't expect to get your news from a documentary.
B00000J7JO|4.0|While some argued that Californication signified the band's descent into mainstream pop, I don't think that happened until 2002's disaster 'By the Way'. 'Californication' fits better with the rest of the band's catalog. It's got strong rock songs like Parallel Universe and Right on Time, and they do the radio thing better than ever before as well. Otherside was one of my favorite songs from 1999, and obviously Scar Tissue and Californication were standouts in their time. It's true that the harder edge of Blood Sugar Sex Magik doesn't make itself known on Californication, but the band remains true to itself. Guitarist John Frusciante carries the slower numbers with soaring, almost McCreadian riffs, returning after a hiatus that saw both the band and Frusciante himself come close to death.
0140277447|5.0|I visited this site today because I was just shocked to know that Iris Chang killed herself due to her long lasting depression.  But what makes me more uncomfortable is that here I saw so many people are denying this history.  I am Chinese and I stayed in Nanjing for 7 years.  During my 7 year stay in the city, I often heard news that numerous skeletons were digged out by construction workers in the city, with Japanse bayonets and wine bottles,etc.  To my surprise, even some Korean here is helping Japanese rightists to deny the history (Probably actually he is Japanese). <br /> <br />But anyway, if this problem is not resolved, there must be another war between two countries sooner or later in the future.  And I guess China now is no longer a weak country as 70 years ago, which any one could humiliate unhesitantly.......
B000001Y5J|3.0|This record has a couple of NIN's finest songs on it, there's no denying that. \\"Wish\\" is part of the alt-rock pantheon; \\"Gave Up\\" and \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" are both among NIN's best as well. For the most part, 'Broken' also does away with the cheesy 80's-ness of Pretty Hate Machine and gives way to the same basic sound that the band has defined as its own. There's more lyrical ambiguity on this one than the previous record, as well. It seems a little more respectable somehow when the rage, while manifest, is not as directed. <br /> <br />Now, the bad. This is an EP. If they had fleshed it out with 7, even 5 more songs, this would probably be their best record. As it stands, it ends and you just wish there was more of it, so you go back and listen to \\"Wish\\" and \\"Gave Up\\" over again. I find that a little disappointing.
