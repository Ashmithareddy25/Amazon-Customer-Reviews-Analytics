0316017922|2.0|The weakest of his 3 books. He has a flowing writing style(he is a writer), but the examination of the topic is, well, superficial and disappointing. Ex: He claims the Beatles are were they are due to the 10 yrs. of practice(10,000 hours) and an opportunity.  Not that they are especially talented or creative or intelligent.   Gladwell fails to see that many people put in the 10 yrs. of practice and get opportunities, but all certainly fall short of the Beatles success--why?  Plus, only the first half of the book discusses the topic at hand. He skips around to discuss other interesting, but unrelated topics(like airline accidents). He clearly likes to write, but this one lacks depth. Rent it at the library or skip it.

Outstanding audio - this is the best Queen that will ever bless your ears.  Great song list - really covers the bands versatility.  Look forward to seeing this timeless concert again and again.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|It is! For anyone who grew up in the 1970s and knows what I am talking about, this is not news; great movie, lovely story (a[...]) and yes a very entertaining product that deserved all its accolades BUT is this not a just a sequence of Roger Dean [...] LP Covers...??? (OK, go to your record collection and look: The Floating Mountains = inside cover of Yessongs; the journey to the Banshee lair = outside cover of Relayer; the tribes by the seas = Tales from Topographic Oceans; various beasties and set pieces = Osibisa, Uriah Heep and Baker Gurvitz LPs...    Check out Roger's web site and then look at pieces entitled 'Floating Islands', 'Tsunami', 'Sea of Light', 'Dragon's Garden' and 'Space Needle'. Conincidence? And where is his credit??    Whatever went on behind the scenes it is just so nice to see all those static images we tried to envision as dynamic way back when as spotty teenagers we got high on the ideas of them being real places, this is as close as we can get...    Well done!

B001CTDH76|4.0|The Mentalist is a smart, dramedic semi-procedural that features an investigative team for the California Bureau of Investigation and their permanent consultant, a mentalist [Patrick Jane] who pretended to be psychic - and whose wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer he angered with an unctious profile on live TV.    The cast - Simon Baker [Patrick Jane], Robin Tunney [Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon], Tim Kang [Agent Kimball Cho], Owain Yeoman [Agent Wayne Rigsby] and Amanda Righetti [Agent Grace Van Pelt] - is as solid as any on TV.    The actual series is a first-rate whodunnit that uses the CBI team's investigative skills to allow Jane the opportunity to observe and improvise - resulting in the solution of the crime [usually murder]. Occasionally in the foreground - but always in the background - is the spectre of the serial koller, Red John, and Jane's desire to find him and kill him. Despite the darkness surrounding the Red John arc, the show is usually fairly breezy, always smart and enjoyable - especially when Jane and Agent Lisbon are bantering.    Features include: deleted scenes [Lost Evidence] for three key episodes; Gag Reel [actually pretty funny]; Evidence of a Hit Series [interviews of cast and creative team] and Cracking the Crystal Ball: Mentalist vs. Psychic. There are no audio commentary tracks and only the Evidence of a Hit Series featurette can be considered a quality feature.    Grade: The Mentalist: Season One - A  Grade: Bonus Features - C+    Final Grade: B+
193413712X|3.0|The story of how Paul Harding's novel won the Pulitzer prize for fiction was so moving (see Motoko Rich's article \\"Mr. Cinderella: From Rejection Notes to the Pulitzer\\" in \\"The New York Times\\") that I let it jump to the head of my book queue. An additional draw was that large parts of the novel are set in Maine, where I live.  I really wanted to like this book.<br /><br />I didn't. The premise of the story is an interesting one. George Washington Crosby lies dying in a hospital bed in his living room. He is surrounded by members of a family that loves him and by some of the many clocks he, a master craftsman, has repaired. His body is dying, but his consciousness is alight and drifting in time, back to his youth and to his epileptic father, a tinker who abandoned his family, as well as forward to hallucinations about the very room he's lying in.<br /><br />The stories of George's life, of the life of his father, Howard, and of Howard's father, a \\"strange, gentle man,\\" are the most appealing parts of the book. Some of the lengthy passages in which Harding evokes the bleak houses and deep forests of his fictional West Cove, Maine, are stunning, too, but others are merely tedious. There is nothing particularly \\"Maine\\" about this landscape, although \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" another forest book, makes a cameo appearance. (Hawthorne went to Bowdoin College). The setting of \\"Tinkers\\" might in fact be any cold northern place. And mostly dreary are the recurring passages from an 18th century clock repair manual. \\"Tinkers\\" is a novel about the passage of time, but the inclusion of commentary from \\"from `The Reasonable Horologist,' by the Rev. Kenner Davenport, 1783\\" seems merely a literary conceit.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers\\" is not a long book, but I read it in fits and starts. Sometimes, the narrative of the Crosbys, grandfather, father, and son, drew me in for a spell. At times, the lyricism of a description of a dark road at twilight compelled my admiration. However, too often, the novel's digressions--to clock-repairing, to botanical description, to hallucinations of crumbling ceilings and floating heads--made me want to put it down again.<br />M. Feldmano clock-repairing, to botanical description, to hallucinations of crumbling ceilings and floating heads--made me want to put it down again.  M. Feldman
030745455X|4.0|I enjoyed much of this second book, but felt it was more formulaic than the first in the trilogy. At times it seemed as though the author was reminding himself to stick with \\"the formula\\" and be sure to add lots of sex scenes here and there and insert cliff-hangers here and there. For some unnecessary reason--unnecessary to my mind, at least--he included mathematical formulae here and there that really seemed to be the author's joke to show the reader that he might be letting the reader in on a not-at-all-secret formula for writing fiction--just for fun.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|In March 1973 Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon. The retail shops soon found that this album was to be the bench mark used to judge the quality of the new \\"Stereos\\" that were making the market. If Dark Side sounded good, the stereo was good.     And so to Avatar, this film will be the benchmark for many things. Testing ones home theater (Mine's a Panosonic 5.1)out for the myriad of sounds from various creatures, machines and other noise making events as they jump around the various speakers and hit you from all directions. Or perhaps to showcase your plasma screen TV such as I have (46\\" Sony Wega) at its ultimate best. Or even that Blue Ray player making it all happen (Mine's a Panosonic Digital Twin Tuner). Whatever your set up is, this movie will make your system/s give up their absolute best and leave you wondering if what you have is an awesome set up or maybe time for an upgrade.    To the movie itself. Well I ignored the pre release blurb/hype. I wanted to judge it for myself. I loved the Abyss and I loathed Titanic. I found myself watching a cross bewteen an action story, a love story, a conservation story and even a dry humour story. I don't know what Cameron had to do to satisfy the purists whom seem less than enamored by this film, but for me the 162 minutes took me to a place where I want to go even if it is dangerous. It took me away from the real world. Isn't this what Cinema is all about? To tell a story? And Science Fiction can take you to places that may exist as but far as we know it, is currently only in one's imagination. I really don't know where the time went. There were no slack bits, the romance delicately handled, the action at times ruthless, and the conservation theme very much there.    I felt the actors gave it an awesome effort and that Cameron's direction ensured that the amazing effects did not over shadow the actors in the fore. I mean there's plenty going on in the background yet the fore ground still keeps your attention. Being on Blue Ray, I was also able to pause, get up and have a look at something in the background and be amnazed at the indepth details.     The musical score was consistant and a pleasure that helped enhance rather than distract. The total package is well wrapt together. Weta workshops did themselves proud and as a New Zealander, I am very proud of their work done in studios not 25 miles from my residence. I dont know anyone whom worked on this film, but I wish I did. I shall have to remain a proud New Zealander and dream of one day visiting Pandora. Well, in the Cinema or in my \\"Man Cave\\" with my home entertainment center at most.    I look forward to the possible 4 disc release in November and it's a long time before we get 3d TV's etc here in NZ and at a realistic price.

B002ZFQD04|1.0|Top 10 Reasons why this is the worst Madonna Tour, ever.    1)The opening graphics are shockingly cheap and amateur looking.     2)When Madonna appears on stage she has a leg hanging over her chair with her crotch exposed. Classy!    3)Half of the songs are ruined by Madonna screaming the lyrics instead of singing them (MY SUGAR IS RAW! etc.)     4)Kanye West shows up with a non-sensical rap during \\"beat goes on\\". That part of the song should have been cut out.    5)The new arrangements for familiar songs are not good (Into the groove, Music, Ray of Light)    6)\\"Borderline\\" is one trip too many to the very old song well. It's done exactly like \\"Burning up\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" were for the re-invention tour.    7)Ridiculous vulgarity: she humps everything in sight (dancers, JT videoscreens, and when there's nothing available, air), she puts her hand down her pants, she flips off the crowd, screams mother f'er several times).    8)Hideous costumes. We actually laughed out loud when we saw her appear on stage for \\"4 minutes\\".    9)Noise does not equal rock-n-roll. \\"Hung up\\" will cause blood to flow from your ears.    10)\\"She's not me\\" starts promising, but, devolves into bizarre, violent performance art    3 Reasons to account for the one star rating:    1)The \\"Vogue/4 minutes\\" mash up sounds great and is expertly staged.    2)\\"You must love me/Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" is beautiful.    3)The \\"Like a Virgin\\" sing-along is fun.    One reason that goes both ways:    1)\\"Give it 2 Me\\" is very well done, with the exception of the \\"get stupid\\" breakdown (GET stupid? You are already stupid for including this section in an otherwise fantastic song).    Madonna is a great live performance and her shows are legendary for good reason. Unfortunately that is not evident in this tour. I recommend \\"Confessions Tour\\" or \\"Drowned World\\" instead.

1595141715|5.0|Gut wrenching, heartbreaking and thoughtful! Thirteen Reasons why is centered on the suicide of Hannah Baker - Hannah leaves thirteen recorded reasons for her suicide. Each tape deals with a specific event and person who adds to the snowball that eventually leads her to give up on her life. Clay Jensen (Hannah's crush) is one of the several people who will be receiving the cassette tapes, and who takes us along the journey of a girl's emotional trauma and ultimate choice to end her life. I felt for Hannah's pain and also Clay's. It is a book I highly recommend although it is a teen read it would serve some adult to read as well.
0380725398|3.0|I first read Jamica Inn as an inexperienced teenager living on dreams and fantasies of finding true love and living happily ever after.  I thought the story of Mary and Jem was a wonderful love story, over coming all obstacles, giving up all for true love, over coming evil, and setting off for a life of romance and adventure. Ten years later and no longer dreaming of love and happily everafter I reread this book. It depressed me.  Mary, by going off with Jem, had condemened herself to the same life that had drained her aunt of hope and vitality.  Drink and time would eventually turn Jem into the same abusive character his brother had been. When the kids started coming and there was no steady income, no secure shelter Mary would turn into a shrew.    It really depressed me.    The story was suspensful, and the author was a gifted writer. Just don't think too long on the future of the two lovers after the book ends.

B000002NC4|5.0|I could write a term paper about this album. Perhaps not entirely from an objective standpoint though, since it pulls at my heart strings every times that I hear it. There is an undeniable fluidity to this record that makes it not a collection of songs, but a single, geniously orchestrated body of work. \\"Perfect From Now On\\" shouldn't be listened to casually, it deserves not only the listener's complete attention, but it is much like a Celtic tapestry - a piece of art that the viewer could become absorbed in and meditate to. *(Note that the same melody from the end of \\"Made up dreams\\" coexists on the album on a verse in \\"Velvet Waltz\\"). The cello was a bold and brilliant move also.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|Not a great one mine, James Cameron's main problem is similar to george lucas's, he writes bad dialogue. Some of the dialogue made me cringe in embarresment. Once a directors head get's too big and he does not illicit decent help in writing a screenplay things can end up like this.<br /><br />I won't rehash the story as hundreds of people which nothing else to do have done so. It is an enjoyable film but not a great one.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and saw it.<br /><br />I saw it 3 times.<br /><br />It was good, very american though which I expected with Jim Cameron at the helm.<br /><br />Every detail was there.<br /><br />Pandora.<br /><br />The blue things.<br /><br />They had real eyes.<br /><br />I wish it had more adult scenes though and the ending was very lion king.<br /><br />Zoe is a gorgeous woman, I'd like to have seen her as nature intended in the film.<br /><br />I live in Australia so was happy with Sam's performance.<br /><br />Enjoy Avatar.
B0001I561E|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1992 movie \\"Aladdin\\" boasts an intelligent screenplay, great songs, and the huge climactic battle we have come to expect from Disney-adapted fairytales and legends.  Yet, there is a crucial element missing that would have taken this production from being a very good modern Disney flick to being one of the all-time great animated films from the studio.<br /><br />For every good choice in regard to vocal casting, there is either a corresponding bad choice and/or negative consequences.  For example, Jonathan Freeman is an excellent choice to voice Jafar, the evil sorceror.  Silky and cultured, yet also dripping with malice, Mr. Freeman creates a classic Disney villain with his vocal performance.  To voice his parrot, the cleverly named Iago, Gilbert Gottfried is absolutely the wrong choice.  Mr. Gottfried's trademark high screaming voice can be very humorous under the right circumstances, but these are not the right circumstances.  The movie is not tonally suited to the comic.  Scott Weinger's earnest, simple performance as Aladdin is perfect, but I wish Robin Williams had played the genie with a shade more ambiguity and darkness instead of the over-the-top comedy that is strongly in evidence here.  The sharp contrasts between the respective good and evil characters do not favor the movie in the long run.<br /><br />Also featuring the vocal talent of the late Douglas Seale, The Walt Disney Company's \\"Aladdin\\" is very, very good.  However, a few different storytelling and creative decisions would have made it great.
B00000373U|5.0|I'm happy that Elliott Smith ended up getting the credit that he deserved, even though what made his songwriting great is that he never strove to gain any sort of noteriety. That irony, and the honest sort of suffering that made Van Gogh cut his own ear off and that has unfortunately become cliche in the world of modern art. Either/Or is honest, sweet, somber, and bitter. Elliott Smith seems to wear his heart on his sleeve in almost every album he has ever made, this album just seems to be what critics and music lovers laud as his most brilliant. His suicide was sad, but not shocking. RIP.

0810988232|2.0|I was expecting this package with my breath held - because Brian's artwork is really adorable and the Faerie Oracle is the most wonderful oracle deck I've ever dealed with (and I'm dealing with Tarot and other oracles for sixteen years).  And I was rather disapointed with the whole thing. No, Brian's artwork is still adorable and the faeries portraited on cards are really alive. But when I had a first look at the cards it was a scratching feeling that what is written on the cards doesn't belong to that creatures and some of the cards are not going with others. And then I began to read a book and it was a disaster. I've got three questions - does Wendy understand that she is walking in iron shoes over tender flowers? She doesn't hear faeries at all, she writes about her own human problems, what made her think that she can write the book about communicating with faeries? The second question is - did Brian ever read what Wendy wrote? Or he just said 'My beloved wife, write what you want, I trust you like myself'. Because if he read it I think he couldn't let the text to go with his cards. And the third question - what does Jessica Macbeth think about the book. Jessica who really is communicating with faeries and teaches that other people.  So my verdict - remove some of the cards from the deck and throw the book to dustbin, not read what is written on the cards and listen what those wonderful creatures want to tell you.  I think that the deck will work as an oracle even if you follow the book - but it's like using a steam-hammer to crack nuts.

He hires an inmate who is a former US Navy SEAL named Darius Stone to travel to Washington D.C. and track down military men who try to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate the President, led by a corrupt Secretary of Defense named George Deckert.

B002OG5GT8|5.0|While I was generally pleased with the E3, it had a couple of fatal design flaws.

These were corrected with the E5 along with the addition of a handy little clip and 2 different sound settings.

6305313687|5.0|It's difficult to understand how anyone can watch this film without feeling somehow changed. It's a difficult film to watch; equally as difficult to stop watching. It's brilliant, with a very honest look; you get the chance to be on the inside at the Nazi skinhead life; at least as close as most of us would ever want to see. Why this film is so good is that it actually takes you on his journey, and regardless of the content, that will greatly offend some, the message is clear if the movie is understood.<br /><br />Edward Norton, as well as Edward Furlong are so great in this movie; I won't say what has already been said, just watch it! Oh, and both Kes and Sisko are on this too, which is a plus to Star Trek freaks like me!

Commmitted gave me an appreciation for the hisotry of marriage and a bird's eye view of it from different parts of the world.  The first half of the book brings much history to life, the second half is about Gilbert's world and remains that way until the book is done.

A good read, and a fast one, espeically considering the personal ties I had to her story.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|This is a movie which you have to see if you want to know what state-of-the-art special effects are like. The storyline itself is one that has been told in various forms right back to Shakespeare- someone pretending to be someone else falls in love with a person who doesn't know who he really is- and the dialogue is pretty ordinary. However, the creation of the world of Pandora, the Na'vi, the creatures, the vegetation (especially the giant tree) and the battle scenes are simply so unbelievable that they're believable, if you know what I mean.    If you're looking for a deep emotional experience, this movie isn't for you. If you want to gasp in wonder at an amazing alternate world, this is the movie you need to see.
0061537969|5.0|When my book club selected this book to read, I thought, \\"Really?  The dog's point of view?\\"  It was a hard-sell until I read the first page and I fell in love.

He will even grab it while we're reading him a different book and make us read this one instead! It does a good job at telling him he needs to be gentile and making him still feel special and not jealous. I'm excited to keep reading it to him as he gets older and can understand more! He does rub my belly now, sometimes on his own, sometimes when we say \\"love the baby\\" and yesterday he found a pack of Soothies we bought for her and I told him they were for the baby, and he put them on my belly trying to give them to her! I'm not sure how much reading this book has to do with his understanding of this whole thing, but it sure hasn't hurt! :)
0446613444|4.0|Before I read \\"The Black Ice,\\" I had the opportunity to read \\"The Black Echo,\\" which is the first in the Harry Bosch series. I like it, despite some flaws. \\"The Black Ice\\" is slightly better than the first book. It has more suspense, more action, more detective stuff, and a much more shocking plot twist near the end. We get to know more about our main character, Bosch, and the people he works with. The middle section of the book is a bit ponderous (but isn't every book just like that?).

B002VECMAE|4.0|Don't be de-bleated by the negative reviews unless you consider puns, dark satire, and absurdity a waste of time. Given comments of friends who saw this before me, I didn't expect much greatness from this film and waited for the rental, although I wanted to like it. Happily, I liked it a lot. My main criticism is that the story seemed a bit unfocused in parts (and I haven't read the book so can't comment on how the screenplay compares, represents, transfers, etc.). However, on its own merits I think the film as a whole is smart, funny, and engaging.     The cast is as brilliant as you might expect and, between their great work, decent scripting and blocking, and nice editing, the comic timing of the gags and barbs is pretty solid. A few of my favorite scenes were 1) while the Jedi (Clooney) and the journalist (McGregor) are held captive and the Jedi is coaching the journalist on how to tap into his psychic powers, the Jedi says 'Go ahead, \\"attack\\" me,' and the journalist says, \\"What's with the quotations fingers...like I'm only capable of ironic attacking or something?\\" 2) the Jedi's so proud of his successful cloud bursting that he runs into the only rock in the desert, and 3) at a fork in the road, the Jedi instantly (after half an hour) \\"sees\\" the right path and then drives over an IED. Jeff Bridges is delightful as the fallen guru whose reign of unconventional leadership is a back story that we see through flashbacks (which is, in a way, quite appropriate). We learn through a thoughtful assertion that drinking and classic rock help the Jedi get in touch with his psychic energy and, through a confidence, that the coveted eagle feather is fake because real ones are associated with a big fine. All this...and Clooney with long hair!    Throughout is a thread of narration that provides the journalist's viewpoint as he learns about the New Earth Army and the U.S. attempt to be the \\"superpower with super powers.\\" As a side note, I found it interesting how much Ewan McGregor as narrator sounds like George Clooney! Overall, although this film isn't exactly a comic masterpiece, it's wicked fun, all the more so because the military really did have such a program.

You have to insert a disc to see what is on it. It says the season number and the disc number and that is it.<br /><br />The on screen menu is a little clunky and awkward too.<br /><br />Highs;<br /><br />Astounding visual and audio quality. Like I have never seen BSG before.
B00018D44U|5.0|This CD is one that you play over and over, and it sounds better with each turn. Norah accompanies herself as she sings, producing a perfect blending of sounds. Track 9, \\"Humble Me,\\" on which she plays the organ, is especially delightful. A marvelous discovery.

B000WCN8SC|5.0|Some people have wondered what the difference is between the 2006 & 2008 re-issue, and I haven't seen a review that really ironed out the differences. Now that I have a 2006 set in my possession, I can expand on the differences!<br /><br />The discs are all the same, but the packaging is quite different:<br /><br />The 2006 is a more robust package that kinda opens up like a book to reveal the discs. It has a working peephole on the front from where you can view pics of the band via a little spinning wheel in the back (think manual slide projector).<br /><br />The 2008 set is a simple slipcase with none of the above features.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|I saw this on HBO in the US, first season replayed before they launched into the second season. Possibly the best TV ever made. So back in Australia I bought the two seasons, but it was the BBC version, which was more like a documentary.  So ordered this box set from Amazon, and am thoroughly re-enjoying this amazing series.  There's lots of extras, behind the scenes things, interviews, commentaries, I've only started on these. No problems playing this region 1 set on a region-free player luckily. Fantasic surround sound, with street noises and things through the back speakers.  So glad I got this.
1573228737|5.0|I don't think I will say too much, except that this book has touched me in a place where nothing else has. I was enthralled right from the beginning. Sarah Waters writing is so, so beautiful. Every single word was written with care.     When I got the the end, I was struck with pain. It's very, very powerful and has stayed with me ever since.
B002K4MAA2|5.0|Originally broadcast on Channel Four in the UK over five nights in the run-up to Halloween, 2008, \\"Dead Set\\" is frankly the most hypnotically accomplished piece of work to appear in the tired old genre of zombie horror since Max Brooks similarly superb [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] was published several years ago.    The brainchild of British media-satirist, Charlie Brooker, the series follows the experiences of a group of \\"Big Brother\\" contestants who are unwittingly plunged into the horrific reality of attempting to survive amidst the nightmarish cycle of cannibalism, violence and resurrection so familiar to fans of George A. Romero. However, Brooker being Brooker, all tropes and conventions of the genre are eschewed in favour of a thematic tone which is at once deeply realistic and subversively satirical; one can view the entire series as a bilious broadside aimed at our celebrity-obsessed, media-saturated culture and in many ways it is the legitimate heir to Romero's consumerist satire, [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)]] (vastly more so than that director's own deeply unsatisfying attempt to satirise modern media, [[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead]]).     Director Yann Demange juxtaposes the colourful hyper-reality of the reality TV segments which open the story with a grey, desaturated, washed-out look which represents the \\"real-world\\" (and which perfectly compliments the sense of depressing ordinariness with which the survivors come to view their situation), and the cast imbue the characters - who could've functioned as little more than archetypes - with a profoundly flawed sense of helplessness and humanity; I strongly suspect that well-meaning but ineffectual contestant, Joplin (Kevin Eldon) and deeply unpleasant but pragmatically realistic producer, Patrick (Andy Nyman) embody the left/right brain personas of Brooker as a commentator within the piece (and it must be said, as deeply caustic as Patrick is, he remains by far my favourite character and he certainly gets the best lines). The sense of reality that pervades the series is also immensely strengthened by the presence of actual \\"Big Brother UK\\" presenter Davina McCall who appears in a superb cameo.     This is a brilliant, uncompromising piece of television which probably tells more truth about the state of today's junk-food/junk-television/junk-everything obsessed culture than most people will be comfortable to admitting. But then, like our erstwhile survivors, one imagines that it's exactly the kind of people who sit in denial about the state of the world who really 'would' spend a speculative zombie holocaust hiding in a closet bemoaning the loss of Egg McMuffins, \\"Lost\\" and their iphone rather than doing something constructive about their own survival.      Highly recommended.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have always been a real fan of Enya's music ever since she came out with \\"Watermark\\" in the late '80s.  I have also liked \\"Amarantine\\", \\"In Memory of Trees\\" and \\"Days Without Rain\\".  I have been looking for more of Enya's music and did a search on Amazon to see what newer albums she may have produced.  I was intrigued to find an album by Enya that had Christmas music.  The cover jacket of \\"And Winter Came\\" caught my eye, a captivating winter scene, so I suspected that there might be Christmas music on the album.  I listened to the samples and ordered the CD to see what I thought and was very pleasantly surprized.  The first track, \\"And Winter Came\\", is a beautiful combination of instrumental piano, strings and ethereal vocals which I found very soothing and peaceful.  \\"Journey of the Angels\\" is a beautifully sung composition with Enya as the lead singer in the song. There is also a very calming and relaxing vocal and instrumental back-up accompanying Enya's vocal lead in \\"Journey of the Angels\\".  \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" has an upbeat feel with vocals, low strings and percussion and is one of my favorite tracks.  Enya adds an interesting twist to a traditional Christmas favorite, \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\", by singing parts of the song in English and also in what I believe might be Gaelic.  I would have to say that one thing I have always liked about Enya's style is her beautiful and soothing voice.  The lyrics in her songs have such a clarity and beauty to them.    Probably my favorite song on this CD is \\"The Spirit of Christmas Past\\" which is a gorgeous Christmas song.  It has a slower-paced, very beautiful and melodious vocal lead by Enya and is accompanied by back-up vocals and low strings.  The words are uplifting and soothing and when I hear them, I picture looking out my window on Christmas morning and seeing snow gently falling.    The last track on this CD is \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" which to me, is a beautiful arrangement of the Christmas classic, \\"Silent Night\\"melody sung in what I believe might be Gaelic.  Im not sure about the language but I think its Gaelic since Enya sings in both English and Gaelic.  I think Gaelic is an old Irish language.  This classic song is sung with such the ethereal beauty of this foreign language.  Even though I do not understand the words when Enya's music is sung in Gaelic,  I definitely can capture the serene, soothing beauty of these songs which is so relaxing and calming to my mind and spirit.  I just bought the album a little while ago and even though the Christmas Season is over, this is music I could listen to year-round.  In my opinion, this CD is a must-have for every Enya fan.

B00275EGX8|2.0|I guess they did a good job of depicting a true to life war atmosphere but 1/2 way through the movie I started feeling nauseated with a bad headache and had to go lay down, I just had to get away from all the noise & motion. The close-up scenes and constant camera motion was just too much for me, and I'm an avid gore/horror buff plus I've enjoyed many war movies. I was disappointed in this one after all the hype.

B002VECLVO|4.0|I want to preface this by saying I am not a fan of melancholy films. However this was like Tom Fords love letter to quiet desperation. I found Colin Firth's performance to be riveting and very multidimensional. Nicholas Hoult was also a revelation for me. He was so engaging, innocent yet determined. Visually, the film is so stunning from the clothes to the way everything is shot as if under a microscope. I love the closeup shots and how you can actually feel Colin Firths desire to slip away from reality even though its right in front of his face. Even though its a pretty tough subject the film is in no way hard to watch. Its stylistic and very tastefully shot. I would definetly recommend if you are interested to check out this movie. Its unique which is always a plus in the stream of hollywood movies that can be so similar and boring. For better or worse this is not a film that rests on the dialogue, it really is all about the images and the feeling conveyed by the actors in between the lines. Bravo!
0143034901|4.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon makes an at-first perplexing choice regarding the structure of his novel The Shadow of the Wind. The plot of this mystery novel has two separate strands; the first is the present-day (well, present-day is 1950s Barcelona) story of Daniel Sempere and his quest to track down the author of the first book he's truly loved. The second is the story of what actually happened to that dashing young novelist named Julian Carax about 30 years before.<br /><br />Instead of telling his story as two separate in-scene, possibly alternating narratives, he tells Daniel's story in the present in first person and the rest of the story in flashback or other non-in-scene devices.<br /><br />So as I traversed the first several hundred pages, I was annoyed -- I'm not a fan of the flashback device anyway, and I was dreading another 400 pages of backwards-looking storytelling. What's more, as I was still meeting the characters, it was hard to know what was truly important and what was just background info. For instance, in the first 100 pages, Daniel falls in love with a blind woman named Clara -- but then Clara quickly exits the novel. And the reader is left to wonder if she's a significant character for something later on or is she only serving as a sort of cautionary tale of unrequited love? Additionally, one of the first flashbacks tells the story of how Julian's parents met, and the early days of their marriage. Important, or not? I had no idea.<br /><br />What does emerge as the novel progresses, though, is a complex tangle of character relationships and plot twists in both the present and past. But the story is complex in the sense that it's fun to try to do the detective work yourself and make the connections before Zafon makes them clear. It's not complex in the sense that it's at all difficult to understand what's happening. As you learn more about the twists that explain how the characters are connected (and there are some shocking ones!), the novel becomes more and more difficult to put down.<br /><br />Frankly, I struggled through the first couple hundred pages for the reasons mentioned above, as well as the fact that, at first, the prose is a bit clunky and it does take some getting used to. And there are several strange translation decisions (or maybe just funny typos -- \\"the dice [sic] had been cast\\", for example) and some anachronistic prose (\\"Young man, you're a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you?\\" -- in 1950s Barcelona?). But by about the midpoint of the novel, the translation hits its stride, and the reader is treated to some wonderfully atmospheric and beautiful writing. In fact, for a novel in translation, for the most part, the narration and story-telling is surprisingly smooth and easy-to-read.<br /><br />So even though this novel violates one of my all-time literary pet peeves -- telling story through flashback -- (and yeah, like Zafon cares about MY pet peeves!) I will still begrudgingly admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it, because I understand now why Zafon made the choices he did.<br /><br />(One piece of advice if you decide to pick up this novel: Don't read the cover and inside blurbs. They do the novel itself a vast disservice.)ut down.

B0035WTE2U|5.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: The Vinyl release of this will be available on May 25!<br /><br />Just so I can say that I've reviewed every AC/DC item possible on Amazon, I checked out this soundtrack. At first I was like \\"Yeah, I liked this soundtrack better when it was called \\"Who Made Who\\"  but I gotta say... the mix is pretty damned killer. Theres a lot of peeps who wouldn't know where to begin when it comes to AC/DC and if you are one of them this is a great entry point. There is an equal ratio of Bon tracks to BJ tracks, and even a few rarities (I'm a big fan of COLD HEARTED MAN, which up until a year ago was only available in the US on bootlegs...)  With fifteen tracks on this only three are from \\"Back in Black\\", less than a third of their seminal album, that you will probably want to get at some point if (duh) you dont already have it... and only one overlap to that older AC/DC soundtrack from Maximum Overdrive, making it possible to eventually still pick that one up too. Keep in mind that AC/DC has NEVER released a greatest hits pack, and these soundtracks pretty much sum up a solid retrospect of their career---so, casual fans can rejoice...  personally though, I'd say go out right now and purchase every album the band ever made because it's all great, but...  For now, with the DVD, you'll be getting a loaded spectrum of the band, with 15 tracks that you can blare out your car window whenever you either want to A.)save the world, or B.) Shoot pick up lines at thick legged women in leather mini skirts. Your call, ROCK THE EFF ON!!

You have to appreciate a little bit of gore, but if you like that kind of thing, this book is excellent! I really like how Abercrombie gets you to care about characters without respecting them. This book is a roller coaster that I didn't want to end.  I read the book in 3 days, and on the third day I ordered the other two  books in the trilogy. I'm hooked, and I'm biting my nails waiting to see what is going to happen next.
B003405MF6|2.0|Jeff Beck is as usual, an incredible guitar player but the album seems unfocused.  The song selections range from orchestral-type string sections, to blues covers, to a \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" cover--all of which sound as though they are nothing more than vehicles for Mr. Beck's guitar work.  I almost wish Jeff would just join some sort of fusion band as the lead guitar player or let someone else select and produce his music.  I love Jeff Beck's guitar playing but the songs on this album leave me wanting to hear something else.

0812973992|4.0|I listened to this book on audio book; the audio book was really well done with each story being read by a different person who really fit the character.  I picked this book up because I had heard such wonderful things about it. It was a very interesting book and overall I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The book is basically broken down into a series of short stories about different people living in New York City in the 70's.  In between stories there are interludes about a tight rope walker who walks between the world trade center towers.  In the end all of the stories and characters are tied together in some way.<br /><br />The book starts out a bit slow; depicting the early life of a pair of Irish brothers and telling about how they ended up in New York City.  One of the brothers is looking for the meaning of God in the derelicts of New York.  Then there is a story told from the point of a old woman who lost her son in Vietnam.  The next story is told by one of the hookers the Irish brother tries to help.  Then a story about a young hacker who hacks into phones near the World Trade Center during the tightrope walk.  Next a story from the mother of the hooker who the Irish brother helped.  Then a story from a judge's point of view, he is the husband of the woman who lost his son in Vietnam.  This is just an example of the first few stories...you get the point.  There are nine stories in total, they are interrupted by interludes about the tight rope walker.<br /><br />McCann does a great job creating believable characters that, while not very likable at times, are easy to sympathize with.  All of the characters are very human.  There is some plot as the stories of all the individuals interconnect and culminate in an interesting ending.  I wouldn't say the book is really plot driven though, it is more about taking glimpses into the lives of ordinary people and what makes them make the decisions they make.  McCann goes into deep descriptions so that you can easily visualize the settings and there is a lot of internal dialogue from the characters telling the story.  This is definitely not an action driven book but more of a slow paced mystery of sorts and a story of the social picture in New York at the current time frame.<br /><br />The title of the book basically tells you the point of the story: no matter what happens history repeats itself and people's lives go on.<br /><br />One of my biggest gripes about the book is that it moves at a very deliberate pace.  People who are into action or plot driven stories should skip this one.  If you are interesting in society and history, or about the ordinary man's story than you will enjoy this book.  The other thing that bothered me was how unresolved the ending was.  I was expecting something awesome and the book just kind of ends at the middle of a scene...I suppose this does depict life but I don't really like my stories to end this way.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book.  It was well done and gave an interesting look into the New York City of the 1970's.  The characters were well done and believable; listening to this on audio book with the different speakers was awesome.  The pace of the book is pretty slow and the ending very open, which were the only negatives to it.  This book is for people interested in the human condition and history.  Action fans or mystery fans shouldn't expect much of either here.is a lot of internal dialogue from the characters telling the story.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|In 1986 James Cameron released a movie called [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] that sits on my Amazon Listmania List of Movies That Will Leave a Permanent Impression. Cameron has another movie on my list called [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator]]. You will not find Avatar on my List.<br /><br />Hey, great CGI does not a great movie make. And Avatar certainly has some of the greatest CGI that I've ever seen. But let me see if I've got this storyline correct: Basically there's this moon or planet inhabited by The Blue Humanoid People. The Blue People have hair-in-a-ponytail that can connect to various living organisms that literally connect their minds to the extent that The Blue People can control the organism; okay, kinda cool.<br /><br />But The Bad Humans (us) want to take over The Blue People's Moon/Planet/whatever in order to harvest some energy-rich resource. So The Bad Humans clone some Blue People, and via some magic machine that allows a human to take over the cloned Blue Person, The Bad Humans can put a spy into The Blue People's society in order to find out where they are and what they're up to. The human has to be asleep to take over the mind of the cloned Blue Person and the cloned Blue Person must be asleep whenever the human is awake. Okaaaayy.<br /><br />Now the really good part: When the cloned Blue Person is introduced to the Blue People's society, he is for all intents and purposes immediately accepted...to an extent. Then he becomes more accepted and as predictable as ever, likes being a Blue Person more than a human, turns double agent and of course gets himself some Blue Person tail (pun definitely intended).  Uh huh.<br /><br />And The Bad Humans get really bad: The leader of the expedition makes a decision in a vacuum outside whatever human government control there is, and as advanced as human civilization has become for whatever year this is supposed to be, is allowed to commit genocide on The Blue People with the help of a military-type commander that is even more extreme than the expedition leader. Ahhyyyye don't think so.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, they're gonna take 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell the story. But heck, what do I know? The movie was number 1 at the box office for weeks; it's the number 1 selling DVD for weeks; if you try to rent it on Netflix you'll be a grandparent by the time it's available and the movie was up for Oscars and stuff. And I'm another sucker...see that at the top of my review where it says Amazon Verified Purchase? Ugh.<br /><br />Look, with all my sarcasm aside, it's a relatively good movie and I was moderately entertained.

0545123267|4.0|I must have missed that memo that stated this book was like Twilight.  I saw it a little (girl likes boy who is not human, the \\"sleeping\\" together without the parents knowledge), but after that I don't think the stories compare.  Grace and Sam just clicked.  Aside from the fact that this is a paranormal romance, their relationship is totally believable.  Grace was an interesting voice in the story.  She's someone who tries to make the most of her relationships because her parents are emotionally distant.  Maybe that's what promotes her fascination with the wolves.  She can sense the feeling of family with the pack.  I thought the different take on wolves changing with temperature was great.  I don't think the rules that govern the pack were as developed as much as other stories.  But, maybe that will come with future books.  I did really like Sam's history.  It was a total surprise to me, and think it really defined who he was as a wolf and as a human.  I'm curious to see what it is that makes him a special wolf.  Because, I know it's there.  There didn't seem to be a lot of minor character development.  But, I think that's the point.  The story is about Grace and Sam.  I was surprised at how fast the story seemed to fly by.  I started it one night intending on reading about 50 pages and soon realized I was 100 pages into it.

Life Expectancy, By the Light of the Moon, The Watchers, Velocity, and The Good Guy are aurguably my favorites, Mr. Koontz has written, with Fear Nothing and Lightening coming up close. Everyone has their favorites of his and ones they didn't like much. All this I attribute to his ability to weave different stories appealing to different audiences. If you loved the four others I listed you will love this book. If you love dogs, you will love this book. Written many years ago, I agree with Mr. Koontz in his afterward, this is one book that he will certainly be remembered for. Written with twists and turns he is known for, this again is one you will not want to put down until you are done and you will wish the story wasn't over when it is.

0439023483|5.0|This was an incredible book. I don't even find the right words for it. It was so desperate and the only thing that matters is to survive. There is no space for hope. Teenagers forced to kill each other in order to survive is just so cruel and although you hope for the MC to survive - somehow you cannot put aback what that means for all the other ones forced into a game of survival.     I felt hopeless when reading this book, it was packed with emotions and in the end, the twist and turn ( well positioned within the story) made it even worse. Whenever you think you can start to breath again the next thing happens that leaves you again gasping for air.     Only because of the brutality of the plot I would give it less than 5 stars, but only because I normally cannot read such books, but I made an exception here and it was well worth it!
034544678X|5.0|This book is flat-out amazing, and one of the most helpful tools I've ever bought. It's not a training manual, more of a dog psychology book, and it's absolutely worth the read.     It helps that McConnell is a brilliant writer who manages to pull off being both academic and conversational at the same time. She gets complex concepts across easily, but still with a thoroughness that I really appreciate.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Take your chances.  As many have found out the new DRM software which is to protect against piracy is in itself a pirate itself. Congratulations to Fox and Avatar being the fastest and best selling Disk to date.  Apparently with something over 4 days being 6.7 million sales.  To bad they have likely pissed off 6 million of those customers.  Actually returned my first purchase, and the second did the same thing.  Then I looked on the net. Googled \\"Avatar blu ray complaints\\".   OMG!  Fox then released a statement that it's all the fault of millions of BR players that need updated software.  Are you kidding? That's like Toyota blaming the drivers.  My player (Sharp BDHP21U) has the most recent software installed,  only 3 months old and the disk still won't play.  Gets past the initial play screen and stops right there.  Actually locks up my player to the point I HAVE TO REBOOT THE PLAYER. DVD disk works fine, but that's not what I purchased. I understand some players do work, but they are limited. You (FOX) have the fastest growing disk of all time.  To bad you didn't test it in the market on real systems.  How about a class action suit from those millions of purchasers? Then the headlines can read \\"Fox loses initial Avatar sales revenues due to class action suit\\". Get real Fox and hone up to your mistake. Correction only starts after admission of failure.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Great to hear how ordinary people stand firm on their convictions even when others they like think they are wrong.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album. I've never heard of Chris Cornell before this since I grew up listening to R&B and Pop and other simular genre. After reading some long-term fan's not-so-enthusiatic reviews, I went and checked out some of his previous work, and I still love this album the best. I think most of the bad reviews are more about criticizing the genre than the quality of the album.
B000I0QKDS|4.0|And the rest is history. Jeff´s Stewart no match for Jimmy´s Plant. At least not in these context. This is more of a historical footnote than a masterpiece. Not very cohesive as Jeff tried to veer Rod into an arena that he did not beling to. Nice try, but not really. Oh well, it sure was a good try.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|i just wanna say, that above all the series i been watching in this years, this is simply one of the best, is  not about all demons or ghost, have it all, jokes, action, drama,etc..  is my favorite, and i would like that never has to see the end, but is my wish, i hope the producers thinks the same way i am.  anyway, see it and enjoy it, is one of a kind!!!!!!!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is pure entertainment...pure \\"fun\\". The manner in which the film is presented (as a documentary) is clever and refreshing.
B00065GX64|5.0|A man is killing children and using modern forensics techniques, the police are after him.<br /><br />That's the story of M...which regrettably tells a tale that remains all too familiar today.<br /><br />Featuring a haunting performance by a much younger Peter Lorre, this film follows the chase as the killings mount and the police draw closer to their suspect.<br /><br />Though the Fritz Lang who made this film lacked the same kind of resources he had when making his epic masterpiece Metropolis, the sparseness of special effects (including sound, then itself considerd a special effect) actually works in favor of the piece's realite and only serves to make it all the more chilling.<br /><br />If art is something that evokes a response in all who see it, then perhaps great art is art that continues to perform its artistic mission even generations after its creators are gone.<br /><br />M is therefore great art.  And this reproduction is a must see, even over the last Criterion release of the same film.
6305181810|5.0|I work for the Insurance Industry for 10 years. Within the 1st years, I found out that they denied 50% of the claims AUTOMATICALLY. And the people that are being denied the claims are the one that get in trouble when they try to contemplate retaliation for denial of claims.  As this Insurance company has a retired FBI agent in charge of claim investigation thus throught this connection, they have the backing of the FBI.  And many Insurance Companies have retired law enforcement officers working for them thus have the backing of law enforcement.<br /><br />Over the 10 years I've seen lot of craps and experience lot of things. With each company I worked for more disgusting than the last.  It was hard to describe what I experience and see to outsider.  As most people are naive about the real world. They only see the world that is portray by propagandas that is created by each industrial group, clandestine organizations & clans (For basic concept of the INVISIBLE world of clans & clandestine activities, read [[ASIN:1574885200 CIA, INC.: Espionage and the Craft of Business Intelligence]], [[ASIN:0806508574 A History Of Secret Societies]] & [[ASIN:0756762812 Secret Messages: Concealment, Codes, and Other Types of Ingenious Communication]]).<br /><br />When this movie first came out, I was amaze at how accurate they portrait the Insurance Companies. From the way they operate to the character of the people in the Insurance Company. The only part that was a little off was the way they portray the Insurance Company denying 100% of the claims. It was a little bit exaggerated but I guess they were trying to make a point. When you exaggerate something a little bit, it hits a little bit harder if you are trying to make a point. Or maybe they could be right in that there is probably an Insurance Company out there denying 100% of the claims and get away with it.<br /><br />From my experience, I would say 50%.  Even if you are two faces, one face is professional and the other is evil, the evil face is only one out of two faces. 1 out of 2 = 1/2 = 50%.<br /><br />Even mathematically the 50% figures match with the 50% I experience from working for the Insurance Companies. Thus my experience can even be verified mathematically. But the math is back up by my own experience thus it is scientifically correct.<br /><br />If you want to see how Corporate Insurances operate, this will give some idea of what it is like.  You can never experience what I observed over the 10 years of working for Insurance Companies in a 2 hours movie. (For an example of my observation skill, read my review on [[ASIN:B001152TLG Skid Row (Full Screen)]]) And since I was lay off from the Insurance Industry/Insurance Companies in the year 2000, I've probably consciously forgotten more than this movie could ever portrait.  But at least you will get a peak of the inner working mechanism of an Insurance Company.<br /><br />If after watching this movie you feel outrage by the injustice you see, then I would recommend you get Insurance with a Non-profit Insurance Companies.  At the moment of this posting there are 83 Non-profit Health Insurance Companies in America.<br /><br />I assume that without the necessity for profit, the need to commit the injustice noted in this movie would decrease substantially.  I guess if you have to paid out $500 millions dollars to the stock holders or your parent company, you would consider committing the injustice shown in this movie to meet your obligation.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about Non-profit Health Insurance Companies, go to \\"nonprofithealthcare dot org\\" for vast resource about Non-profit Health Insurance Companies.<br /><br />Also a Mutual Insurance Company is another option over a Non-Profit Insurance Company.  Mutual Insurance is the equivalent of a Credit Union in the insurance industry.  If any of you are already banking with a Credit Union, then you would know exactly what a Mutual Insurance Company is.  For more information about Mutual Insurance, do a Wikipedia search for \\"Mutual Insurance\\".<br /><br />If you are a big business entity or group, you can always self insured thus cut out the middleman.  Go to \\"Self-Insurance Institute of America\\" website at \\"siia dot org\\" for more information about how insurance operates and how self insurance works.<br /><br />Note:<br />1) If there is any doubt about what I am saying here about the Insurance Companies, I am willing to swear on the bible, in a court of law under the penalty of perjury, which is a felony, and all the legal consequences of perjury.ation about Mutual Insurance, do a Wikipedia search for \\"Mutual Insurance\\".<br /><br />If you are a big business entity or group, you can always self insured thus cut out the middleman.

0743297334|2.0|I suppose its bad form to say something negative about a classic like The Sun Also Rises, but to me the book clearly demonstrated the emptiness and futility of living a life without purpose.  I think this book communicates a message about a generation of utterly lost individuals - searching for meaning and significance in the trivial stuff they do, but in the end living lives of despair without true happiness.  Great book to read for that significant life lesson - and the fact that Hemingway writes so well.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|Two parts to this.   The first is not exactly minor but I understand some things are beyond Amazon and shipping might be one of them.  I was supposed to get this the day after the release. It was going to be a gift. Instead it showed up three days later.  Forcing me to buy another present.     When it finally shows up I hear the buzz....  No extra features.  No, the extra feature DVD will be out later this year....right on the heels of THIS plain Jane.  Fortunately I did not open it so I can return it.  And Amazon has a very painless return process.    So, go rent it if you need a fix (I will) and wait for the new and improved version to come out.  Unless you have plenty of loot or want to give this one away later when the better version hits the shelves later this year.    As for the flick itself....I loved it.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|My husband and I both thought this was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were meant for these roles. The plot was fantastic and the movie was hilarious. There was no boring pause in it like you find in some movies. I would recommend this DVD to everyone.
B000002J03|5.0|Everything about this album is so F***IN cool! Even the Cover rocks! Listening to \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"; NOBODY did that kind of a song in 1969, Led Zeppelin were light years beyond the competition. I could throw eighty billion compliments toward Robert Plant's vocals or Jimmy Page's Guitar, song structure, and arrangements and John Bonham's drumming. However, Im saving my compliments for JPJ bass lines on \\"Ramble On\\" and keyboards on \\"Thank You\\"; The BEST. Buy this album and be officially   blown away
B001HN69AY|4.0|Some films transport you to other worlds.  Some films transport you to other worlds, but only keep you there momentarily.  Such, alas, is the fate of THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.  While it certainly has moments of unadulterated grandeur, certain scenes and moments just don't click, and the end result is a film not nearly as memorable as it should be.<br /><br />But wait, you say.  Isn't this a 4-Star review?  Why yes it is.  That is because, despite its flaws, this film is still worth your time.  First, it stars Christopher Plummer, one of the finest--and sadly, most overlooked--actors out there.  Second, it features Tom Waits in the role he was meant to play (namely, himself, albeit a little more Satanic--but not much).  Third, it is Heath Ledger's last performance, a farewell from a fine and sorely-missed actor.  And fourth...well, the film is just a lot of fun.<br /><br />Centuries ago, Dr. Parnassus made a bet with the devil (who, for some reason, likes to go by \\"Mr. Nick\\").  Parnassus won.  But since that day, he and Mr. Nick have been stuck in a strangely symbiotic relationship; as Tom Waits sneers at one point, \\"I love a betting man!\\"  And now there is a new bet: can Parnassus save the immortal soul of his daughter before the clock strikes on her sixteenth birthday?<br /><br />PARNASSUS is filled with fine performances.  Ledger, Waits, and Plummer carry the show; the scenes between Plummer and Waits in particular are engrossing (although, I admit to being a sucker for Faustian tragedies).  Supporting them are Lily Cole and Andrew Garfield, both turning in fine performances.  Due to Ledger's untimely death, his role was shot so that Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell played him in certain scenes (and yes, it actually works out to make something resembling sense).  Throw in a cameo from Peter Stormare, and Verne Troyer in a role that actually makes you forget it's Verne Troyer, and you've got a film chock-full of outstanding actors.  Combine that with some of the breath-taking imagery (the first time I've actually wished I could watch something in 3D), and you've got a film that is well-worth watching.<br /><br />Yet, it's not for everyone, which is a caveat that unfortunately has to appear on a lot of films these days (yet never the films that actually deserve it).  The script lags in spots; and some things just don't seem to make sense, even in a world where things aren't supposed to make sense.  The ambiguity of the film will also be a bit off-putting; suffice it to say, if you aren't into magical realism, or Gilliam's work, you should probably steer clear.  But if you are a fan, then you could do far worse than this film.  It's magical, mystical, and will pluck at the heartstrings of your imagination.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|For perspective, I'm a First Gen Trekker...having seen 'em all in their respective timeframes.  Which also means I have the benefit of hindsight and I'm not easily swayed.    This movie blows the socks off anything in the franchise.  For example, at the time, we were all excited to see the first Star Trek movie 30 years ago with a huge, realistic Enterprise on a large movie screen. Today - V'ger, cheesy effects, etc. - it seems a bit silly.  Then we had a 24th century luxury cruise ship staffed by preachy goodie-goodies, followed by more gritty offshoots and so-so movies that were heavy on production design, often badly-matted effects and short on substance, save Patrick Stewart's 20-year development of the Picard character.  Although perhaps a bit bland, I never had any particular problem with \\"Enterprise\\"/Bakula because it had substance...until the desperate-for-ratings silliness of alien Nazis.      But J.J. Abrams is exactly the person who was needed to give the franchise an adrenaline shot straight to the heart muscle.  Well done!      *Clever use of an alternative timeline as license to keep the best - including the more successfull, darker side of the Berman style - and jettison the rest.    *Extraordinary casting.  It's obvious to me that each actor is a sharp, accomplished professional who deserves every damn dollar he/she can earn from the movie.  This is particularly true for the primary crewmembers we all know and love.     *Chris Pine deserves special recognition for capturing all the facial, posture and timing nuances of the character developed by William Shatner.  (Did Shatner coach him?).  There is no mistaking this is James T. Kirk.  Pine nevertheless builds on Shatner's work to make Kirk his own.  Again, though, this is something most every lead actor (Quinto, Urban, Saldana, Pegg and Yelchin) does with his/her respective character (Cho, however, is a complete miss on Sulu...James Kyson Lee might have been a better choice, imho, given his action flick background).  A real treat to have such talent together in one movie.    *Storyline development (including humor) and technology are absolutely recognizable to any Trek fan.  If you're okay with basic temporal mechanics, you'll feel right at home.    In short, I'm glad to see a clean break with the [tired] Rick Berman style in favor of something which, to me, is truer to Roddenberry's vision.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|I'm surprised how many folks gave this film a bad review.  I think this is only because the film was marketed to the wrong crowd so the wrong folks are watching it.  This is not a Bermuda Triangle, Freddy Kruger, or Friday The 13 type of horror, Sci-Fi or slasher flick.  Triangle is more along the lines Mulholland Drive, Angle Heart, Memento, The Shining or even Repulsion.<br /><br />I will say for the first 15 minutes or so the movie seems kind of lame and for a time things may not seem to make much sense as characters make bizarre decisions - so you have to stick with it.<br /><br />But once Triangle kicks in (I wish I could tell you how and why it kicks in - but your better off not knowing anything about this film) Triangle is a really good, nightmare of a film.  Carefully and lovingly staged and edited by the filmmakers with very good performances photography and soundtrack.<br /><br />The entire cast is excellent.  The cast are playing American archetypes (not stereo types) - If you are an American who lives near the ocean you will instantly be familiar with these folks of various classes and relationships. All the actors are flawless in that they do not draw attention to their acting but instead simply become the characters - which is the ideal.  Of course Melissa is a standout but her character Jessie is the focus - they were all great.<br /><br />From reading the reviews I think I may be one of the few that understood the ending and the plot and if I'm right this movie is even better then most people think.  A real \\"hell\\" of nightmare.<br /><br />Highly recommend this film for fans of puzzles, non linear plots, off kilter cryptic stories and eye opening, disturbing endings.<br /><br />I wrote an opinion piece and explanation for the film's plot in the comments section after my review. It is all spoilers! - I don't recommend reading it until after you see this cool film.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|One of the most common praises heaped upon Death Magnetic since it's release a year and a half ago is that it is the best album Metallica has released since the Black Album. I would agree with that. Some have claimed that it's one of their best ever but I won't go that far.     For the record, it's hard for me to pick a favorite amongst the first five Metallica albums (For the record, I'd pick pick either the Black Album or MOP if you put a gun to my head). I also enjoyed and appreciate the Loads even though they overdid it with the bone-headed, C.O.C. inspired sleaze-metal. St. Anger? Let's just say that I wish I could find a redeeming quality with that one (to date I have not).    Death Magnetic is the first album Metallica has recorded in the last 15 years that truly sounds like the same band that recorded KEA through TBA. The elements that defined Metallica from '83-'91 are all there. Pounding drums that actually sound like drums, tight riffing, extended middle sections, frequent solos, etc. It's all there.     It doesn't sound exactly the same, of course. James Hetfield does not have quite the same roar that he possessed twenty years ago. He's done way too much damage to his voice over the years, so he deserves some slack. However, he certainly doesn't embarrass himself on Death Magnetic (unlike St. Anger).     The production is also much different, and is truly a bone of contention for many. Like most fans, I wish the album was not so fuzzy and compressed. Not only were dynamics lost (and clipping introduced), but I think the guitar tone really suffered. The guitars lack the kind of chunk that defines the classic Metallica sound. They are plenty thrashy and distorted, but are lacking guts.     The songwriting is solid. The opener, \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", rips like nothing we've heard since the AJFA album. \\"The End of the Line\\" is a rock solid follow-up.     \\"Broken, Beat, and Scarred\\" suffers slightly due to it's cliched lyrics, but Hetfield's delivery is genuine enough to do the song justice.     \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" is the least memorable of Metallica's \\"track 4\\" ballads, and is probably the weakest track on the album. It follows the \\"One\\" blueprint a bit too closely for it's own good; it's lack of originality detracts from its overall quality. It's merely okay.    \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"Cyanide\\" are rock solid thrashers. \\"Unforgiven III\\" is superior to \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" in every way except perhaps in name. Invoking the \\"Unforgiven\\" name likely caused scads of fans to roll their eyes and possibly overlook what really is an excellent tune.     \\"The Judas Kiss\\" is another ass-kicker. \\"Suicide and Redemption\\", Metallica's first instrumental in twenty years, is not quite as focused as their classic instrumentals such as \\"Orion\\" and \\"The Call of Ktulu\\". It is more listen-able than the bulk of \\"To Live is To Die\\" however (I may get flamed for this, but lets be honest, TLITD really plodded along aimlessly in between it's gorgeous opening and middle sections).    The album's final track is \\"My Apocalypse\\", a solid slab of up-tempo  (if not quite full-on speed) metal that closes the album with the same kind of raw energy that it opens with.     Death Magnetic is not on par with Metallica's first five records. However, after two albums of overly indulgent exploration (Load/Reload) and one spectacular failure (St. Anger), it is a huge step in the right direction. While Death Magnetic may not equal the quality from their heyday, it certainly belongs in the same discussion, which cannot be said for their previous three releases.     Death Magnetic certainly bears the scars of Metallica's previous missteps, but  the hindsight of their struggles over the last decade-plus only underscores the fact that this album is a rather triumphant and long-awaited return to form.

B00371QQ2U|1.0|Just to add my voice to all who have speak out here, I need to say this Universal blu-ray disc is painstakingly, outrageously, slow to load and start to play. It's simply unbeareable! Nobody deserves this. Shame on you, Universal Pictures.  The least they could do, if they wanted to show some respect here, would be to withdraw it from the market, make a recall, solve this awfull issue, and make a refund of something like that.  As I live in Brazil, I simply cannot consider sending it back and ask for a refund, because the shipping cost would be greater than the price itself. So... I will have to keep it, like it or not... Too bad for me...    On the other hand, contrary to what some people are saying here, it will load without an internet conection. And... it'll load fast

B0026OE2O8|2.0|Although the filmography here was quite beautiful, the entire film was pushing the man-made climate change agenda and demonizing CO2. Even though films like this, An Inconvenient Truth, etc. are  eloquently portrayed and seem sincere, you have to remember that evil likes to hide behind a pretty face. It's sad really, the whole heart of the CO2 movement is about eugenics. Do yourselves a favor and Google search \\"climate gate.\\" Environmentalism is a good thing, but this CO2 hype is an entirely different beast.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|This set of phones is a good buy but be warned that the sound quality is not all it's cracked up to be.  I previously owned a pair of X1 head phones and absolutly loved them.  They had super clear sound but they wern't 7.1 surround.  The only reason I opted for the X41 was because my cat chewed the wire and wrecked them.  So I figured to avoid that situation again I'd pick up a wirless set.  The problem actually is the consistant popping that randomly happens during use.  This is caused by some kind of interferance from the RF signal from my router or when the batteries start to get weak.  So if you want my opinion.  Go for the wired set not the X41 this set is way expensive I think i made a poor choice in head phones.  They still work great otherwise but to do it all again I'd buy the wired set for a portion of the cost.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Slash has finally got his solo album out of his system and onto our CD players. I was very curious to hear what type of album Slash would produce by himself and how it would translate with all the different singers involved. Ian Astbury's opener has intense groove and is a great way to start proceedings. Ozzy's song is pure Ozzy - need I say more. Some of my favourite rock voices in Myles Kennedy and Chris Cornell nailed their songs with Slash. Adam Levine from Maroon 5 combines to make a gorgeous ballad and Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is a surprise powerhouse on her track. Rocco DeLuca's song is intense and emotional and Iggy Pop's funny take on life is a cool way to end the album. Overall I think Slash has done a great job with this album. The guitar playing is strong and the production is some of the best I've heard recently. Finally, nothing to do with the music but the CD booklet is pretty average as it doesn't have all the lyrics and contains only a few cheap photos of the singers involved.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This season arrived pretty quickly using the free shipping available and was in perfect condition. The episodes are well written and produced for a television show. When you first watch this tv season it feels like it was modeled after The X-Files meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Each week they hunt down some supernatural entity and destroy it. You just barely begin to get into the main series' story arc in this season and that arc is one of the best I've seen on tv. While this season is a must in developing that arc it quickly pales in comparison. In my opinion this television show is a definite recommend! It maintains an overall fun, buddy movie vibe throughout even though the subject matter is pretty dark. If you're looking for something different from all the other garbage on tv pick this one up and give it a try.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Heavy Metal music doesn't get any heavier than this, or better. I have been a fan of this album ever since it's release back in 1984 and it is without a doubt my top favorite Judas Priest album of all time. Upon my first listen to it I was amazed and enthralled by it's high octane and infectious energy. I had never heard anything more powerful come through my speakers at the time, and even upon listening to it today, it is still just as powerful and exciting as it ever was. I am such a huge fan of this album that I even have the poster of the image of the Metallion from the album's front cover hanging on a wall at home. I've read some other reviewers complaints concerning the cheesy lyrics on some of the songs and all I can say about that is, well, that's all part of the fun of it all.<br /><br />Judas Priest's prior album to this one, Screaming for Vengeance, is a definite masterpiece recording, and Defenders of the Faith continues in that tradition and then some by delivering even more addictive power metal songs and anthems than seems humanly possible. Just sit back and pop this disk in your player and feel the music pummel you into a pulsating pulp with awesome tracks like Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Heavy Duty.<br /><br />By this time in their careers, the mighty team of Glen Tipton, K.K. Downing, Ian Hill, Dave Holland, and Rob Halford, were like a well-oiled precision Metallion music machine and were really at a creative high point during the mid Eighties, and it definitely shows on this album. But to be honest, Judas Priest have hit many high points throughout their career and continue to do some very excellent and amazing music to this very day. In fact, I consider their reunion album Angel of Retribution to be just as good as anything else that they have ever done, but, I digress and shall save that review for another day.<br /><br />Defenders of the Faith is a definite must-have album in any Hard Rock/Heavy Metal fan's collection and will go down in history as one of the best, if not THE best Heavy Metal album ever recorded, cheesy lyrics and all. \\"We'll rise inside ya til' the power splits your head.

0312427999|5.0|NOTE: this review only covers Part 1 - Part 5    In The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein surveys the rise of and subsequent use of the \\"shock doctrine\\" as a method of instilling neoliberal policies into the governments of various countries from Chile to Russia.  She traces the birth of this doctrine, its relation to shock therapy, and the way countless economics, dictators, and other officials have attempted to craft a new world order that never went according to plan.  With a definite bias, Naomi Klein makes no apologies for her views, yet as radical as some might interpret her to be, she presents a compelling view of this political and economic philosophy that certainly resonates with current events, particularly the earthquake that devastated Haiti earlier this year.      If there is one figure at the heart of Klein's narrative of neoliberal ideas it is Milton Friedman, the figurehead of neoliberalism, a man who counseled various foreign leaders in their attempt to implement the shock doctrine.  The primary aim of the shock doctrine is to \\"shock\\" the economy of the country by drastically changing key policies that align with the neoliberal agenda.  Most often, these times of drastic imbalance follow an uprising, coup, war, or the like. In this state, the citizens are already feeling a sense of distress and therefore, any additional shocks to the economy should not be a major issue.  So, what Klein is attempting to do is to show that capitalism is not born of freedom and that \\"unfettered free markets go hand in hand with democracy\\" (pg. 22), but instead to challenge that \\"official story of capitalism\\" by demonstrating that capitalism, \\"has consistently been midwife by the most brutal forms of coercion, inflicted on the collective body politic as well as on the countless individual bodies\\" (pg. 23).  Whether or not one subscribes to the beliefs of Naomi Klein, she does propose a very convincing look at the ways economics and political intertwine on a global scale.    Beginning with the links between shock therapy and the shock doctrine, Klein basically suggests they work the same, both are aimed at erasing a \\"memory\\" if you will, to create a clean slate.  In shock therapy, a new set of behaviors may be imprinted, in the shock doctrine, a new set of economic policies is to be enacted, specifically neoliberal policies - free trade, deregulation, privatization, etc.  The chapter on this relationship between the two actually works to shock the reader, to show how unscrupulous these doctors were in trying to treat their patients, and these same doctors were coincidentally enough government funded for the most part.    Without going into too much detail, subsequent chapter discussed the way the shock doctrine was executed (or attempted) in countries around the world; Klein uses Chile, Poland, South Africa, Russia, and China as prime examples.  Each case follows a similar trajectory with a leader or faction in power that a certain cabal of insiders who wanted to shock the countries political and economic systems until they were replaced with neoliberal ideas, policies, and practices.  In Chile, probably the best example from the book, a group of Chilean students taught at the University of Chicago (home to a neoliberal contingent of economists) formed a group called \\"The Chicago Boys,\\" and these men infiltrated government positions and advised the military leaders who were planning a coup to force the president out of power.  This scenario was repeated in several different incarnations around the world; Klein shows how governments from Communist to Democratic were all injected with a neoliberal agenda and how shocks in all the examined countries facilitated the changes that were to be necessarily to support a change.  All cases, although very similar, are not always the same as the case of Russia and China illustrate.  As these countries seemed to be transforming into democratic countries, underlying this adjustment was the shock doctrine, which was exercised differently than it was in the cases of the Latin American countries.  Interestingly, as was the case in South Africa, and an example that stands out slightly, although Nelson Mandela and the ANC (African National Congress) came into power, their control over South Africa was more than show than an actuality.  The men - white Afrikaners that had been in power for decades - continued to control the country's politics and economics behind the scene.  But in all of these examples, the main point is that government coups, backhanding dealings, and other shady transactions were carried out to impose a new rule of law - that being neoliberalism.    Part Five and one of the most interesting and compelling sections deals with the shock doctrine in the United States.  Here, Klein weaves together the conjunctures between all the Bush era players, Bush Jr., Cheney, Rumsfeld, etc. and shows how each of these men had all the money in the world to gain from privatization efforts pre and post 9/11.  The figures that Klein quotes Rumsfeld and Cheney making in their business ventures are mind boggling, and only reinforce the Bush administration's need to want to impose their own form of shock doctrine.  What is most frightening about these figures is the example of Rumsfeld who was Chairman of Gilead Sciences, the company that patented Tamiflu.  In other words, in any disaster where large quantities of Tamiflu were needed, and while people were suffering, Rumsfeld and the company would being doing financially well.  Although this whole section was a little too \\"conspiracy theory\\" for my personal liking, Klein does you make one think more about the implications of those government officials being tied so closely to large for profit corporations.    Overall, The Shock Doctrine is well researched, clear, well written and most of all a very, very compelling read.  If you agree with Klein's views, you will love this book, if you are more of the neoliberal and conservative variety, you will probably not enjoying reading it and will certainly disagree with Naomi Klein and what she has to say.  Overall, I think no matter one's political or ideological leanings, The Shock Doctrine makes the point of how tied together we are in a globalized world.  Globalization does not just affect politics, economics, culture, or society.  It doesn't just affect material goods, but it influences the way we all live our lives in the twenty-first century.  As many reviewers have stated already, this book is eye opening, yet it offers the hope that maybe if we all become a little more educated about what is going on in the world, we could do something more to change it to the way we see fit.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious, the sixteen-year-old very overweight title character is anything but precious to her mother, her father, her classmates, and street kids. Her mother, a mean-spirited, nasty piece of work has beaten most traces of self-worth and self-esteem out of her. She continually insults her and treats her like a slave. Precious is pregnant with a second child sired by her father.<br /> When she's sent to an alternative school in Harlem's Hotel Theresa, a caring young female teacher takes a personal interest in her as does her social worker to a lesser degree. Her new classmates grow to genuinely like her and stick with her when she has her second child.<br /> It's an intense, devastating, disturbing film. The scenes with her mother are truly shocking. Precious has fantasy scenes in which she escapes to a world of glamour, romance, and fame.<br /> As the film progresses, and as Precious learns to read and write, she develops a sense of her own worth. She becomes a proud mother, and she evolves into her own person. The scene in the social worker's office in which the mother tries to get Precious back is a tour de force in an Academy Award-winning role for the actress Mo'Nique.<br /> It is a brilliant piece of filmmaking with an air of street verisimilitude that is striking. Films have truly matured when you compare this very realistic and powerful film to the tame treatment of similar subjects in movies of the nineties.<br /> Be aware that the action of the film takes place around 1987 because this is a crucial period in the plot. The girl playing Precious, Gabourey Sidibe, does a fantastic job. The movie is based on the novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire.
0375413405|5.0|A gift for my wife that she appreciated.  She psuedo-collects recipes and cookbooks so this was highly appropriate, and she has since cooked recipes from the book.
0316168815|5.0|This was such a wonderful book, I saw the movie first and I'm glad I did, the book was so much more than the movie could have been. I enjoyed it and it was hard to put down.I recommend this book to everyone it was an excellant read.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Wow.  This really is a beautiful CD.  It's not just the music, but the packaging is incredible.  I buy most of my music in digital form these days but this one is definitely worth getting in the box.  It is the nicest presentation of any CD I have ever purchased.
B000005HFH|5.0|Ordered on a Saturday and delivered on a Wednesday! Price was right! Jazz Standards, that I would recommend to anyone who asked. The album cuts are short with radio air time in mind. I listen during drive time to prep my  mind for work's onslaught. I would also recommend catching \\"Lets Get Lost\\" on Sundance Channel. The following is from the there website. Musician Chet Baker personified '50s West Coast Cool Jazz. His good looks led to comparisons with James Dean and Montgomery Clift; on the trumpet he was arguably Miles Davis's rival; the intimate wispy languor of his vocals made countless women swoon. Yet three decades later Baker was a ravaged ghost of his former self, a stark testament to hard years and hard living. Shot during Baker's final year, Bruce Webers \\"enigmatic, hypnotic\\" (Washington Post) film tribute garnered an Oscar® nomination for Best Documentary.
B0026P3G12|5.0|HI all - I live in Brazil and bought this CD from amazon.com as it is not being sold down here. I followed all the commotion on youtube and the BGT show etc etc. Although the media focuses a lot on her story, for me it is her voice and depth in her interpretation that are unique. I cried in a many songs the first time I heard the CD, but not a cry of sadness, but of pure emotion. Something about her voice, I don't know. My faves are Wild Horses (Gosh - I just listened to the original version of the Rolling Stones on youtube - aweful - hers is muuuuch better!), Cry me a River and especially Proud. I wish they had included one Celine Dion cover song - it would be great to have Susan singing without all the screaming that Celine does. Anyways, I hope they release a new Susan's Cd soon with more songs... Frankly, I think that they should continue with the same formula - repackaging cover songs to her style and voice. I wonder how many beautiful songs are out there that we never appreciated because of the original vocals or musical arrangements. Anyways, Susan - if you read this, your voice is what is making all this happens to you. Keep up the good work and enjoy your life at the fullest. God heard your prayers, now make HIM Proud, ok?
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is very easy to follow and delivers super results if followed on a regular basis.  I love this no nonsence workout!!
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|I was at the record store and saw this as a new release, now that thanks to all those mp3 illegal downloads records keep getting cheaper and cheaper so it is a sure bet tu buy a low priced record  for an excellent group of musicians playing together. With just the invited guests in the lineup I guessed that this would be a decent record. And it is.  Some songs are OK, others are just fillers but it's noce to see that all his guitar playing skills were not lost.  If you really miss old school rock (even though it has Kid Rock) this album is good to have.  If the rating could include half stars I would rate this 3.5 but it is certainly not a 3 star album.. so i choose to rate it 4 stars.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Just finished watching this. I was sent it by mistake by Netflix when I ordered another dvd and I almost didn't watch it. I thought I'd give it 5 minutes to see if I liked it and I was hooked within the first 30 seconds. VERY uplifting and such a feel-good movie. Such an aspiring story. I don't think it was good enough to win Best Picture but Sandra Bullock was amazing and she rightfully won Best Actress. Please rent it or check it out at your local library-you won't regret it.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|I notice how may of the reviewers refer to this film as an 'updated' version of Sherlock but if you have read any of Sir Doyle's books you would understand that Mr. Ritchie has, in fact, given us a more original story than any of the previously made 'classic' Holmes films. Mr. Holmes was a boxer and quite the rogue at times in the books. In addition, Mr. Watson was in the service of Her Highness' Royal armed service. If one thinks about it logically, the duo would have to have a bit more than just cunning to be involved with investigating cases that have some of the worst perpetrators in London. Doyle also had a penchant for criticizing the aristocracy on the down-low and placed characters like Lord Blackwood in his stories. I appreciated Ritchie's nod to Freemasonry using some very old imagery and symbols and his acknowledgment of the technological advancement of the late 1800s. Many people think the stuff we have now was developed during the mid-late part of the 20th century but that is not so. Keeley's Resonance Engine was one and that got suppressed by coal interests - over 100 years later, and it's still not on the market. My hat's off to Mr. Ritchie, who has done it again with his eye for action, taste for dark humor and intuitive direction. I suggest folks grab a few of Sir Doyle's books - he was ahead of his time - and I thank the cast and crew of this film for bringing us the true nature of Sherlock Holmes and his boy Dr. Watson.
0802473156|5.0|I stumbled across this book last fall, and it provided some great insight into how the people you love want to feel loved by you.  In addition to my personal life, I have also used this book at work.  The concepts of feeling loved by either Gifts, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Quality Time, and Words of Appreciation do transfer to the workplace when it comes to recognizing your staff and dealing with colleagues - espeically those whom you may struggle to understand.    I have since read the Singles book, and most of it was repetitive of what was contained in this book, so even if you are single, this book can apply to you if you don't get bent out of shape about the references to married life ;)    I probably reference, suggest, or use the ideas contained in this book at least once a week!  It's an essential book if you have a relationship of any kind!
B003E48AYC|5.0|Went to see the movie when it first came out and was NOT disappointed. This movie was breathtaking in scenery, saturated in colour, the acting was incredible and the music was the icing on the cake. There wasn't a moment of boredom!<br /><br />I had read the White Queen stole the show but I beg to differ. While all the actors turned in a wonderful performance in their own right...the Mad Hatter was endearing, Alice was wonderful and irritating as a 19 yr old is, the Red Queen was outlandish as only she can be and her Knight was self-serving in grandiose way. But the one who stole the show in my opinion was Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat...the cat was sly, cunning, sweet, came and went (as cats do) and was the best in show.<br /><br />I've loved Alice in Wonderland since my Grandmother used to read me the Jabberwoky as a bedtime poem. I came out with stars in my eyes and knowing that I must own this movie. It is one of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman's best. The critics know not of what they speak. It is a must see movie! This is the stuff that dreams are made of.
0307454541|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing books I've ever read!  I thoroughly enjoyed every last word!
030745455X|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book and couldn't wait to dig into this one. I was not dissapointed.<br /><br />You often see the term \\"keep's you up at night\\" in reference to books. This is the first book to have ever done that to me. I have literally read thousands of books and never had a problem putting one down.<br /><br />When I got to the last 100 pages I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up past midnight to finish it and had to be at work at 5am!!<br /><br />I heartily recommend this for any fan of the thriller/suspense genre. I can't wait to read the next one!!
B0001XALT6|4.0|A very well-made movie with a great cast and fine score by Howard Shore. The 1.85:1 picture is excellent and enhanced. Note how at the end of the movie the snub nose revolver in Ray Liotta's hand suddenly changes to a semi-automatic handgun (with which he shoots Harvey Keitel) and then immediately switches back to the snub nose revolver again.
B0002JJBZY|3.0|I was initaly so excited to get these as a gift from my wife, as I watched these I noticed that the shows were just thrown together without any thought or consideration and just hurried to get them out for sale.  the shows are not in the order as originaly shown on  air, The price paid for each set was high-about $80.00 ea were what my wife had paid for them, also the whole menu is ridicilous, after each episode you have to navigate around to click on the next episode you want to see, why couldnt they just let it play unless you want it to change?  I know these are available on blu-ray, come on, the quality cant be that better, the hi-def can only be as good as the original tape was.
0385342020|5.0|This was a great, whimsical book.  I thought from reading the description of the book that it would be kind of flaky, but it was far from it.  Well written characters, great story.  Highly recommend.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Oh, how I love this group.  Saw this performance on PBS and immediately ordered the cd from Amazon.  However, it was defective.  As soon as I contacted Amazon, they expedited the shipping of a new cd and also sent along everything needed to ship the defective one back.  Great, GREAT customer service, Amazon!!    And Celtic Woman's newest is worth every penny!!
B002UHSDUK|4.0|I'm not a foo fighter junkie - just bought this to have some of their work.  I enjoyed most of the songs - a few are great.  Old fashioned rock that's not a downer is hard to find.  That's why I like these gentlemen.
B000Q9EPUG|4.0|As a huge fan of the video game, I desired a greater understanding of the Halo universe. This book provides just that with enough excitment to keep me reading all night. Parts of this book even brought me back to Ender's game. I look forward to reading the rest of the literature about Halo.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|In my opinion, Community is amazing! The writing is witty, the characters are great, and it is just genuinely enjoyable to watch. It is great to see Chevy Chase again, and he is hysterical! Abbed may be one of the greatest television characters ever created. If you like the office or 30 rock, you'll probably love this show. If you don't, you still may love this show. Give it a shot!    I, along with many other people I know, were thrilled with this show from the beginning. Some others that I know needed a little bit of time to get acquainted with the characters before they really got into it. So I urge you, if you're a little skeptical after the pilot give it a chance for another episode or two.
B000MFEA40|3.0|Get Chronicles in vinyl if you can. The mastering is all over the place on this record. Wrote a song for everyone sounds like it does on the Green River vinyl, very dull and muddy. (The entire vinyl album of Green River was very pale sounding.) Unfortunately, Wrote a song for everyone is not on Chronicles, but it is on Chronicles II, which wasn't mastered as well as Chronicles. If there are CCR songs on this album you are looking for, nothing is gained or improved in this master over the albums the songs were lifted from.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|A fitting end for one of the best rock bands around. Strong song writing as always. Vocals are fantastic as is musicianship. This is a \\"don't miss\\" cd.
B000NE6FUM|5.0|If you haven't heard this album on vinyl, you haven't heard it the way it sounded that made it the huge hit it was. For the most part, Billy's CD's of his 70s classics just lack any guts. Hearing Rosalinda' Eyes and Big Shot on vinyl blew me away again. The bass is rich, the vocals warm. Wonderful! These are songs that for decades I had fallen out of love with until getting this record. Thanks for letting me revisit what was possibly the best decade ever for singer/songwriter greats like Joel.
B002VECM6S|5.0|My family tends to be movie fanatics.  My parents probably go to the movie theater once a week and sometimes more.  Most of the time they just do it for a date to get away from me and my sister, but when they went to see the Blind Side, they invited me to go.  I am so glad that they did.     I loved this movie.  Sandra Bullock played her role to a tea.  As saddened as I was by her friends and their attitude toward Michael, I was impressed at the way that this family took Michael in and gave him a place to stay and ultimately a family.  We are going through a series at my church right now talking about social justice and stuff, I was impressed to see that this Christian family went against the grain with taking this boy in.  Mrs. Tuohy exemplified some deeply Christian characteristics even in the face of peer pressure.     I was caught off guard as well in this movie by the hostility and ungracious attitude of the teachers at the school.  Also as a Christian, I am called to love others no matter what.  These teachers in a profession where they are supposed to love there students and want to teach them so that they can grow, most of them were not willing to take the investment to help Michael through school.  That was rather interesting.    My favorite scene in the movie was when Michael was invited to join the Touhy family.  He said, \\"I thought I already was part of the family.\\"  That was awesome.    I wish the real Michael luck in his NFL career.   Thanks to the directors for such a quality movie as well.
B000W40JNC|5.0|Ditto on what I said about 52nd Street. Billy's vinyl kicks butt on his CDs of these classics. Say Goodbye To Hollywood rocks on vinyl. All the CDs I've heard of these great songs, including the remasters, sound weak on bass and lack character. Miami 2017 is a song I never cared for, but have come to like it now that I hear it as it was intended. If you are not familiar with this widely overlooked gem, check it out (in vinyl if you can)and then proceed to his follow-up The Stanger. You can hear a master honing his craft. BJ is among the most prolific songwriters in pop history, and a great singer to boot.
0743201140|5.0|This product shipped very quickly, it got to me even before it said that it would arrive. The book was in perfect, new condition just like the description. All-in-all it was a perfect transaction! I apologize to the seller for taking so long to write this review.

B003A060TW|3.0|It's hard to verbalize why I didn't love this album, because well....it's a good album. There are great tracks and interesting things happen. I suppose my qualms don't necessarily fall on intentions that failed, but on the intentions themselves. I feel like dance music is too linear for Dan. What makes his stuff so interesting are the explosions into sound, the 180s, the implementation of strange sounds in a seamless way. His albums have been about exceptional moments. Moments where you haven't realized your attention has floundered, until it is suddenly and aggressively reclaimed through some sonic shift.     The mere introduction and stripping away of different layers is just sort of below him. This isn't his first attempt at dance music either, as Start Breaking My Heart showed us just how electronic this guy can get. But even though that was a dance-y-ish album, it still wasn't straightforward enough for you to lose attention. This album was kinda like oh, I guess an hour has passed and I just listened to the new Caribou album. On albums like Up In Flames and Andorra I rarely forget and by rarely forget I mean absolutely never forget that I'm listening to a Caribou album. He doesn't allow me to wander off. But for someone as ambitious as Dan, you're bound to have albums that don't quite work......it's actually kinda nice to know he's human after having so many consistently incredible releases.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|I was very surprised by how awesome Orianthi is at playing guitar! She's awesome! Buy it!
B001ECQ6E2|4.0|In reading some of the other reviews posted, most of them seem divided into three camps:  the religious, the contemporary politically-correct, and the technical.  As far as the first two camps are concerned, I will say that any major movie company, regardless of who they are, would be stupid to invest large sums of money in producing a movie that would not reflect the prevailing attitudes of the movie-going public at the time of its production.  In addition, a successful film script should be reflective of those prevailing attitudes.  Whether or not the attitudes of that time hold up sixty years later is another issue.  At the time of Quo Vadis' production, we need to remember that the American public was in a post-war, anti-Nazi, anti-dictatorial frame of mind.  Anti-Soviet attitudes were growing by leaps and bounds, and families went regularly to church.  Public attitudes change with time.  In a mass-communication world where attitudes can change almost overnight, criticism of a product that reflects what the prevailing attitudes are with an earlier time must be tempered with the realization that was how people viewed their world and society at that time.    Quo Vadis reflects very well, the prevailing public attitudes of the time of its production.  I have not read the novel and cannot tell whether or not the script conforms with the novel.  But the length of the film probably could have been cut down to about two hours, though that probably would not be sufficient time to show Commander Marcus Vinicius' growing hate of Nero and increase of belief in the Christian faith.  It is known that Robert Taylor was not the preferred actor for this role, nor was Deborah Kerr the preferred actress for the role of Lygia.  What makes Quo Vadis interesting is the antagonist-protagonist, lesser-actor roles of Peter Ustinov as Nero and Finlay Curie as Peter.  We probably could have done without the romance of Marcus Vinicius and Lygia in the film and brought the roles of Nero and Peter to the fore, but it's romances that sell gothic novels and movie tickets.    As far as the restoration of the film is concerned, this was an excellent candidate for transfer to blu-ray and the looks of the original Technicolor negative reflect that quality.  I'm glad that the film restoration technicians decided to keep the original mono soundtrack vice trying to make a 5.1 surround-sound transfer, which simply didn't exist at the time of the film's production.  All-in-all, a great issue of a document reflective of its age and times![[ASIN:B001ECQ6E2 Quo Vadis  [Blu-ray]]]
B00393R1ZC|3.0|After waiting so many years for Daria to be released on DVD, this set is kind of a let down. I realize that Daria can't be released with the orginal music, but watching the show is different without the music that went along with the time period. That said, I'm so glad to have a Daria DVD collection that it almost doesn't bother me. But what feels kind of insulting is the piece of paper inside the DVD case explaining that the show can't be released with its original soundtrack, and basically saying that we should just suck it up and be glad that we got a DVD collection at all. That's all that comes with the DVDs (which are packaged in a crappy case that keeps falling apart when I open it). No booklet, no episode guide, just a slip of paper telling us that the music is gone and we should just get over it. I feel like the fans who have waited so long deserve something more. It feels kind of like MTV throwing the DVD set at my head and saying, \\"Here it is! Happy now?!\\"  Um, thanks MTV...I guess it's better than nothing.
0316017922|1.0|I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished \\"Blink\\" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.<br />Another claim is that we cannot become world-class at anything unless we have put in 10,000 hours doing it. It just sounds, I don't know, arbitrary. We can all find examples of prodigies that could take the wind out of that claim. I know teenage sax players who can play all John Coltrane's solos - without having put in 10,000 hours - and that really is no mean feat.<br />In a nutshell, the problem I have with the book is that the author, unscientifically, sets out to find evidence to back up his theories. He does find some example lives to dissect but then somehow generalizes their specific actions and events to suit his assertions. Yes, it is true that some people, like Bill Gates, were in the right place at the right time but it is not possible to predict how he would have ended up if those \\"lucky events\\" did not happen to him.Maybe somebody that computer crazy would be so driven he would have found another way to have access to mainframes? So nobody is going to argue the claim that our culture, generation, good luck, lineage and birthplace of contribute to our chances of success. But to suggest that success is not so much about hard work, talent, drive and intelligence - well, to me that is stretching it a bit. A few examples (over 300 pages) to the contrary are not evidence of anything except the natural variety of all things.
076532413X|2.0|If you are a fan of the TV series, DO NOT buy this book. I am not saying this so that you can avoid the possibility of learning something you shouldn't know about what's coming up in the series. I, and I'm sure others too, started reading it with that very same motive once the mid-season hiatus took place. And I can assure you, you will NOT learn ANY of the series' many secrets if you read this book. The two are as different as can be, and the only character from the book that has any prominent role in the series is Lloyd Symcoe, and his character and its circumstances are VERY different. The creators of the TV series simply took the initial idea from the book but have developed characters and situations that are entirely unique. After getting hooked on the TV series, I must say that I find the book to be very disappointing. The series drives on intrigue, suspense, action, mystery, but the book is grounded in very dry science. The selection of the main character says it all: the TV series puts a federal agent at the heart of the story and watches as he tries to uncover secrets (a very wise choice), while the book revolves around the scientist who caused the \\"flash forward\\" and his team of scientists. I can't spell it out any clearer. While I do not wish to put down the novel or the novelist (who I applaud for his capable handling of very highly scientific concepts), I am more impressed by the way the show's creators have adapted it into something much more. This is a very good example of how to take someone else's fascinating idea and turn it into something that a greater audience could appreciate.
B00003CXA2|1.0|My son wanted the movie \\"Forrest Gump\\" fo rhis Bday but recieved a commentary of the movie instead!!! We were both very upset and disappointed!!!
1579128149|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old son who loves math and science.  He and I were both enthralled by the gorgeous luminous photos and fascinating facts.  The author's style is accessible but not dumbed down, the information includes both the important and the trivial.  I highly recommend it as a gift to anyone with a remote interest in science or the beauty of our universe.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am hard pressed to think of a sci-fi film which is better than Serenity. The dialogue is smart and snappy. The plot is involving, the characters endearing.    On it's face, the summarized plot sounds rather shopworn-- a ragtag, motley crew of reluctant outlaws sets out to save the galaxy from an evil empire. Sound familiar? But similarity with other, better known (or perhaps just more expensively produced) films of the genre ends there.    I don't recall any vital systems literally falling off the Millenium Falcon in mid-flight. Neither do I recall any of the various Enterprise commanders robbing a backwater bank of a payroll just to keep going one more day. Character, dialog and storyline play a more important role than CGI special effects or whiz-bang techno gadgets. Perhaps that's why this film has aged so well where others have not.    Note that familiarity with the TV series, Firefly, is not necessary to enjoy this film, although it does give background and added depth to some of the characters-- Shepherd Book and Inara, in particular.
B0026SCMNM|4.0|I first heard about Brooklyn from the blog Largehearted Boy, just like the last book I read (All Other Nights). I read the description on Amazon and thought, \\"A book about an Irish girl studying bookkeeping who moves to New York in the 1950s? Well, I have to read that!\\" (I'm an accountant, and Ireland is one of the countries I most want to visit.)<br /><br />The description above is the book in a nutshell, but of course there's more to it than that. Eilis Lacey is a young woman (I'm not sure the author ever says her exact age) living in Ireland with her mother and sister, Rose. Her father died several years before, and her three brothers are all working in England, so it's just the three of them in the house. Hoping to make a bit of extra money, Eilis begins to work as a sales girl in a local shop for an elitist woman, but Rose wants something better for her. Together with an Irish priest living in Brooklyn, she arranges for Eilis to move to America, where she will work in a department store, continue taking bookkeeping classes, and discover many more opportunities than Ireland has for her.<br /><br />To say that this book is not action-packed is an understatement, but it is descriptive and detailed, providing an interesting account of life during the mid-20th century, especially as it relates to the Irish-American community. One slight issue I had was with the narration. It's told in third-person, but I couldn't really figure out why. The narrator knows nothing beyond the scope of Eilis's own world and her emotions. If she's confused by something, the narrator is too. If she wonders what someone is thinking, the narrator does too. Nothing is gained by having this unknown voice tell Eilis's story. I think the book would have felt more personal and engaging if it had actually been told from her own point of view, but maybe that's just me. Other than that, I liked Brooklyn a lot. Eilis is a flawed character--there's no denying that--but stories about perfect people are rarely interesting (i.e. Twilight, in which Bella's worst flaw is that she's a klutz). There were times I wanted to be her, and others when I wanted to slap her in the face, but any book that gets me to connect like that is one I know I can recommend.e rarely interesting (i.e. Twilight, in which Bella's worst flaw is that she's a klutz).

B0035WTE2U|5.0|If this were an AC/DC Greatest Hits collection, it would include songs like For Those About to Rock, Money Talks, Who Made Who, You Shook Me All Night Long, Blow Up Your Video, Heatseeker, Rock N Roll Train and others.  This is of course the soundtrack for Iron Man 2 but if you need to categorize these songs it would be AC/DC's Baddest Hard Rock Songs.  Songs like Rock N Roll Damnation, Guns For Hire, and War Machine by Bon Scott and Brian Johnson side-by-side drive home the point that this is the biggest and baddest hard rock band on the planet.  If I were a 16 year old just getting into AC/DC this would be the perfect collection of Paint Peelers to find out what this band is really about.  The fact this collection covers everything from early Bon Scott to 2008's War Machine with Brian Johnson demonstrates not only the longevity of this band but the fact that these songs, contrary to media tripe, are all very different.  The contrast between songs like 'If You Want Blood' to 'Razor's Edge' to 'War Machine is huge, yet they all still fully embrace that bone jarring, hard as a rock, feel good, rompin-stompin feel good rock n roll sound.
0785126708|1.0|I borrowed this good looking hardcover from the library. It features the Hulk, nuff said.<br /><br />As a casual Marvel fan and being somewhat familiar with Bruce Banner and gamma radiation etc, I can tell you that this is pure drivel. There was no way I could really delve into this.<br /><br />Hulk was abandoned on a planet. He somehow made it up the food chain and fell in love with the queen, got her impregnated and somehow she dies (nevermind the physical impossibility of any tryst). So Hulk is burning with vengeance when he comes back to Earth. Somehow he pummels Black Bolt into nothingness, just about overwhelms every other superduper hero until he meets the Sentry. I lost it from there. Something is chaotically wrong with the Marvel universe.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|I have seen this movie in the theaters when it came out and I was impressed with the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. By watching it now in blu-ray it only enforces the fact that he is a great actor. The story of the movie is just ok in my opinion, but what is interesting is the tense and classic moments of negotiations between Lewis and his \\"victims\\". Unfortunately there are plenty of people out there just like his character, and those are what we are used to call \\"successful\\" - perhaps, but since I can only give credit to ambition (it's a good quality) and not greed, this is not a story line that interests me as much.    As a norm in almost all Hollywood productions, every time a character is doing something \\"bad\\" he/she is wearing a cross. This is getting old - yes we all get it, there is a lot of hypocrisy out there, but I'm tired of seeing bad guys on screen wearing the cross. I have not seen a movie that shows any bad guys and assassins wearing the star of David or any other religious symbol besides the cross.    So besides the usual Hollywood flaws and a somewhat poor storyline I give this movie 5 stars for the performance of the two main actors alone. Very impressive indeed!

It's called having a positive attitude. It's never been a secret, just hard to come by if you have a clear and critical  mind. The path  to this \\"secret\\" is told in a much more interesting way in the above product link. It's amazing how people get awayed when they hear pseudo scientific terms. \\"Resonance\\" and \\"Laws\\" etc. RIDICULOUS. There is a difference between being negative and being critical. I worked for a guy who employed this method: \\"the secret\\", in his business all but to disregard other \\"laws\\" that affect the world of business. Now he's out of business.<br />The world is complicated, people are complicated, moving within the world successfully (open to interpretation) requires a helluva lot more than a blindly positive attitude.

She wasn't believable in this role, I kept waiting for her or someone to jump up and say, \\"PSYCH we were just playing; now here's the real movie.\\"  For the future, she should stick with musicals or light comedies or romantic comedies but NO MORE thrillers or dramas......please.

We'll see about the content later.    To the guy who complained about mixed Metric and English units - most Spanish-style classical builders use Metric, so you are lucky to have those figures converted for you. I use English units for layouts and millimeters for plate and side thicknesses, bracing, and scale length. It's easy enough to do as you like.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This is my second purchase of the Griffin iClear Armband Case with Clip. I am still using my first one, but wanted a backup one. The clear case for the iPod is very sturdy and I love the clip. It is worth the money alone. I haven't used the armband yet, but it seems well made.(the clear case w/clip can be used separate from the armband) I will be putting the armband to the test now that our weather is getting nice and I will be out and about more. I looked for this type of product in a lot of stores and only one store had this and for almost triple the price. I'm very pleased with this product.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|I bought this cup holder for my Uppababy Vista stroller and I'm very happy with it.  The middle compartment holds my wallet, keys, cell phone, and occasionally I stuff in whatever toy baby is playing with.  The cup holders are great for water bottles and drink cups that have lids and straws.  I deducted 1 star because it is not very good for cups with coffee lids as it sways and causes spills on to the stroller.  I leave it attached to the stroller when I fold it.  I've also been able to hang the diaper bag from the stroller handle while the cup holder is attached.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|I have always been fascinated by legends and myths of ancient Greece the way they were retold from the ancient epic and lyric poems, and I could spend hours counting the liberties taken with the famous legends in the new action adventure Clash of the Titans (2010) but I will only mention few of them. Zeus, the king of gods did not appear seduce the mother of Perseus, the main character of the film, in the form of her husband, Acrisius. Acrisius was the father of Danae, who was predicted to be killed by her son. Frightened Acrisius imprisoned Danae in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. Zeus entered the chamber in the form of golden rain, and from that union Perseus was born. After several generations, Zeus would disguise himself as a husband of another beautiful woman, Alcmene, resulting in birth of the greatest Greek hero, Hercules. The guardian angel of Perseus in the film, the beautiful woman named Io, was according the legend his foremother, from who the greatest heroes of Greece would descend.  Io died long before the birth of Perseus, and simply could not accompany him in his journey.  As a matter of fact, Perseus was on his quest for the head of Medusa Gorgona alone, and two his half-siblings had helped him, the gods Athena and Hermes. Perseus from the legend never was depicted as the rebel against Gods and the fighter for the human rights. The Legend of Perseus is so beautiful and poetic that it deserves to be filmed without deviation and strange changes.  I never understood why every director and screenwriter who decided to make yet another adaptation of the well known legends should add some preposterous changes to them? One more thing - what with the title? The Titans, also known as the elder gods, were the children of Gaea, the Earth goddess and Uranus, the sky god. The Titans ruled the earth before the Olympians with Zeus as their leader overthrew them and banished them to Tartarus, a place deep beneath even the underworld, dark, sunless and gloomy.  There are no titans in the movie and evidently, no clash of the Titans.  And it's been notice by many viewers that the Kraken was not even the monster from Greek mythology but from the Scandinavian. The huge dragon that was sent as the punishment for the queen Cassiopeia's vanity belonged to Poseidon and had no name.  But even these liberties with the source material are not the main problem of the film. The 3D effects, the main reason why I went to see it in the theater, were of poor quality - images had double edges and were unclear. Only after return from the cinema, I found out that the movie was not filmed in 3D but converted after the filming was over. To make it 3D, was the rushed decision, and as the result, did not add to the watching experience but made it worse. The film boasts a lot of action scenes, fast and furious but they were shot by a shaky camera and primarily cause a headache. I personally liked only one action scene, the battle with the Gorgon Medusa. To give a monster so terrifying that a glimpse at her would turn any creature into stone, Natalia Vodyanova's face, one of the most beautiful and adored faces in the world was a cute idea.  My advice - wait for the DVD but  if you  have to see it in the theater, save yourself the money and see the 2D version which I've heard is pretty decent visually.

Unlike most programs, the Colonial Defense Forces take only those who have experience and knowledge in life, which is why they must be old.  There are some rules however, despite the promise of being able to fight in an old body (they must do some kind of regeneration the enlistees believe) there are some heavy prices to pay for joining.<br /><br />You are considered dead to the World and not allowed to come back to Earth.

How will John Perry help complete that.<br /><br />Scalzi writes very intriguing characters.  They are real and complicated and best of all, not perfect.  They all have flaws and make mistakes.<br /><br />My only complaint about this novel would be the language used in it.  For being hundreds of years in the future, the language is written as someone would talk now.  The cuss words are all modern cuss words.  When you look at history in just a mere hundred years going from \\"cad\\" to \\"d**k\\" it stands to reason that those same names would not be used that far in the future.  They'd be replaced by something else.  But in this novel they are not.

B003DYGP04|4.0|I have read the sneak peek and there are some obivious and less obvious hints about what will happen in this book.  1. Dr. Kanes bag- the bag is obviously holds incredible power. it is probably some ancient relic from the Egyptians that kane recieved sometime in his life. I think the bag is kinda like the ring in the lord of the rings with a sort of addicting charatceristic to it which is why you are told to only keep it for a week and pass it on. carter and sadies dad did not do this and now is bound to keep it until set send him into oblivion( not a spoiler its in the description).  2. Their Mom- if you read the sample you know that she died at that obelisk thing. she probably had something to do with that egyptian thing and she died because of it. I also think tha Dr. Kane may try to bring her back to life.  3. Egyptian- I do not know as much about egyptian myth as i do greek but I can tell that in this the gods are not the good guys. Egypt was the founder of magic so I'm sure that will come into play. I think that whatever this group th ekids dad is in is fighting against the gods and that they my be planning something nasty.  4. Spatula incident- i really want to know what happend there that just sems hilarious.  -this is most of what I found from reading the sample of the Red Pyramid thanks if you read it.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Be prepared to buy new equipment, if you want to see it in HD.  The Avatar Blue ray disk did not play in my two year old Sony Blue ray player, nor would it run in my one year old Dell Computer's player.       Also the picture with the regular DVD is rather fuzzy and you cannot select a 16:9 wide screen version. So you stuck watching a cropped version of the film.    The experience was a total disappointment and a massive waste of time trying to get it the run right.
B00003ZA27|3.0|Predictably, Karajan calls forth a wide spectrum of responses--from  adoration to reprobation.  I am by no means allergic to HvK's interpretive priorities, even in Bach--a composer who hardly features as a Karajan specialty.  Moreover, his rendition of this apex of Western sacred music is better than one might have expected.  The overall approach is not all that different from Jochum, Klemperer or Richter--except that Karajan is consistently more introspective than Jochum, livlier than Klemperer, and more flexible than Richter.  His tempos are mostly plausible (except for the dogged trudge through  \\"Credo in unum Deum\\"), and there are few interpretive eccentricities (only the hyper-reverential account of the fugue subject in Kyrie I and the over-dramatized rendition of the \\"Crucifixus\\" failed to convince me). Most of the time, Karajan manages to convey the work's majesty without sacrificing either its intimacy or its exuberance. His pointing of orchestral detail is frequently illuminating. Add to these virtues a fine quintet of soloists (Janowitz and Ludwig are outstanding) and a freshly remastered recording that has greatly enhanced the choral focus, and this would seem to be a strong contender for listeners who want a more traditional version of this inexhaustible work.<br /><br />The main problem with this performance--and it detracts considerably from Karajan's achievement--is the choral singing. In the first place, the Wiener Singverein is too large a group to negotiate Bach's treacherous roulades with the requisite nimbleness. Moreover, the choir's diction is frequently mushy, and the sopranos tend to sing with an obtrusive vibrato.  Most damagingly, the entire group has persistent problems with intonation.  At times I found it difficult to determine what pitches, in fact, were being sung--but that, I suppose, could be chalked up to the vibrato.  Elsewhere, however--particularly in sustained passages--the choir tends to sit noticeably on the flat side of the note.  This is a very significant problem indeed for a work dominated by lengthy choral movements.<br /><br />So, in the end, I cannot endorse this set as an unqualified recommendation, even as  a supplementary version.  Fans of Karajan and/or the soloists might want to hear it, though the conductor's earlier monaural recording of the work for EMI is superior (both as interpretation and as performance--despite some shaky trumpet playing.  If you are in the market for a \\"basic library version\\" of the B-minor Mass employing modern instruments and a \\"traditional\\" approach, I would recommend Jochum/EMI, Klemperer or Richter (preferably the studio recording from 1961).  Shaw/RCA has some eccentricities, but is frequently both insightful and inspiring.  If you are looking for a PPP version, there are many options--Gardiner's 1982 recording for DG/Archiv still chief among them.is is a very significant problem indeed for a work dominated by lengthy choral movements.

0385523386|4.0|I love memoirs.  I love reading about other cultures, lifestyles, religions, etc.  I especially like reading about those things that I, myself, will never experience.  I loved the book, \\"I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced\\" for that very reason.  And, I really liked Orange is the New Black for the same reason.      I hope to never find myself behind bars.  However, I could relate to Piper Kerman more than I could relate to Nujood Ali.  I am white, in my 30s, educated, and from the East Coast. For this reason, I tried to put myself into Kerman's place and imagine what I would do or think if in the same situation.    Ms. Kerman was honest and her words very thought-provoking.  I believe she handled her situation and her time behind bars with dignity and grace.  I think with this, and  a little bit of luck, she emerged stronger, wiser and more appreciative of the little things in life that we often take for granted.      I feel the same way having read this book.

B000001EG6|4.0|Although it is self titled, \\"Elton John\\" was actually Elton's second album following \\"Empty Sky\\" which had been released the previous year.  This was the first album that really put Elton on the map commercially and produced the hits \\"Border Song\\" and \\"Your Song\\" which remains his traditional live show closer to this day 40 years later.  One thing that immediately sticks out on this disc is how heavily orchestrated it is.  Almost every track features an orchestral accompaniment which is not necessarily a bad thing, but does tend to date the album a bit.  The album contains several tracks that take an almost progressive rock direction especially \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" and the album closer \\"The King Must Die\\", both of which are great tracks.  It is kind of amusing listening to \\"60 Years On\\" today when Elton is indeed in his 60's when the song was written when he was in his 20's.  Overall this is a good, but not great Elton John album.  It made him a star and contains a lot of good material, but he would do better later.
0393072231|5.0|First and foremost, \\"The Big Short\\" is the captivating story of different individuals, working independently of each other, swimming against the Wall Street tide that mindlessly pushed subprime mortgages.  Just as one didn't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate \\"Moneyball\\", the author's story of contrarian thinking applied to a sport characterized by the insularity of its management, readers with little knowledge of CDOs and CDSs will enjoy this tale of investors whose nature gave them the insight and conviction to stand up to Wall Street's conventional thinking -- and, at times, to the extreme discomfort of their own clients -- long enough to reap a fortune when the tide suddenly turned.  And, by the way, the book also happens to explain a lot of what's behind today's headlines.  A great read!
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|Evangelion 1.11 is without a doubt the best looking anime yet released on blu-ray.  In the box is one 50gb blu-ray disc with the main feature (with dual audio tracks for English and Japanese of course), and several special features.  Included is a booklet detailing the impetus behind the \\"rebuild\\" project, which also details a few scene by scene comparisons (original to rebuild) and character profiles.  The main feature is, for me, the main attraction, and funimation doesn't disappoint.  Eva looks great.  In fact it's never looked better, the team behind rebuild (no longer Gainax for those who want to know), have gone back to the drawing board, literally, to recreate the show in a 16:9 theatrical format.  Original key animation was used as a jumping off point for the entire project, which means that while there are many shots that look identical to the original series, there is not in fact any reused material.  The end result is a pristine picture that is free from the blemishes that plagued the older Evangelion dvds you may have seen. In short, this is the best looking Evangelion available.<br /><br />The story itself though, that's a different matter.  To those people who haven't watched Evangelion, and just plain don't get what all the fuss is about; welcome!  Evangelion 1.11 you are (not) alone is a wonderful place for you to start.  To diehard fans of the series I say this; this is not the Evangelion you remember.  While all the major events in the first 6 episodes are presented here in the first entry of rebuild, the pace is decidedly faster than the original series.  This is probably rebuild's biggest asset and greatest liability at the same time.  New fans will probably appreciate the snappy pace of the series, but if you're like me you might find the pace somewhat jarring.  The original series was very ... deliberate in its pacing.  While I appreciate the fact that Shinji's decision to pilot the Eva came so quickly this go 'round, I miss the flashback sequence detailing his first confrontation with an angel.  Originally the viewer is kept in the dark about what happened, in the middle of the first battle Shinji awakens in a hospital in the episode titled \\"unfamiliar ceiling\\".  A good deal of time goes by before it's revealed exactly what happened with unit 01 and the fourth angel, and the audience reacts with the same shock that Shinji experiences when he begins to remember the outcome of the battle.  That moment of revelation is both more powerful and more subtle because it's more removed, in terms of time, from the event.  This is the sort of thing that happens throughout the entire disc.  Like I said earlier, all the big moments are there, but to me they seem rushed.  A lot of the subtlety of the series seems to be getting swept under the rug for the sake of brevity.  I still like rebuild 1.11, but I don't yet love it.  It's going to be difficult for the rebuild to dislodge my love of the original series, warts and all.
0393072231|5.0|So many of the books that detail the making of the financial crises go into much more detail yet fail to better describe the actual financial instruments and actions that comprised the whole terrible, greedy mess. None describe it more clearly than Lewis. And Lewis knows how to structure and pace a story. If you want to read about the crisis, I think this is a great palce to start, then expect everything else to be less readable, more detailed yet often, less accurate.

0316017922|4.0|The classical view of success--the American dream--hard work will get us anywhere. This idea permeates American culture and is visible in our independent spirit and love for the underdog. In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell argues there is much more to the story behind success. Hard work and all the sallies of the will are requisite, yes--but not thorough. Anecdotes ranging from Bill Gates to the Beatles paint the intriguing story at work behind the scenes of success. The evidence is thought-provoking, and Gladwell's ability to intertwine it into a deeper narrative make it difficult to find a good stopping place--You'll want to devour it in one sitting!     While Outliers is certainly engaging, Gladwell's thought-provoking evidence is suspect at times. I personally don't doubt his argument on the whole, but his reliance on the audience to extrapolate results of such narrow studies onto his larger claim are a difficult proposition for a critical reader.  While the evidence is specific, it still represents only a limited number of possibilities. Gladwell leaves it to the reader to decide: Do I believe that what is true for this example is true in general? Readers who don't will have a hard time following Gladwell's argument, because he expects the reader to connect his narrow evidence to the larger argument.     The opening chapter provides an example:  Gladwell claims that a \\"Matthew Effect\\" exists, and argues the implications of our arbitrary systems are small advantages that compound over time and lock children into patterns of achievement and underachievement. The main anecdote he provides is from the Canadian Hockey League. Gladwell asserts that professional hockey players become great because they are born close after the cut-off birthdate, which makes these players \\"big\\" for their age and results in preferential treatment over time. His initial evidence is a table of birthdates for one of the teams, The Medicine Hat Tigers.     The evidence, which is similar throughout, is tactfully deployed to Gladwell's advantage, but herein lays the problem. Gladwell's purpose is to incite the reader to think deeper about the story behind success. With such fluid storytelling, he accomplishes this purpose. However, this also causes the reader to think about all the other examples Gladwell didn't include. Would they tell an even more surprising story about success behind the scenes? It is difficult to know for sure. A more diverse set of evidence would have certainly been weightier than multiple pieces of the same stature. Measured in terms of enjoyment, Outliers is still largely a success. Even if it is thought provoking due to a shortcoming, Gladwell still manages to provoke better than any of his contemporaries. While you might not think of success in Gladwell's way after reading Outliers, you will definitely think about it more and differently than ever before.

Piper Kerman made this journey with acerbic wit and a keen eye to informing those on the &#34;outside&#34; and examining our universal &#34;inside&#34;. I traveled with her as she rode the ups and downs of her very changed life and in the end, I was also changed.
B003HI3MSE|5.0|Bullet for my Valentine's new album is awesome!  Although, as evident in other reviews, it is somewhat of a departure from earlier albums.  Some may think that this new type of music is a step back, while I have to say that it keeps Bullet's music fresh and provides variety to their overall library.  I want to keep this review short and simple by saying that the new album delivered on my personal expectations and maybe a little more.  For me, \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Begging For Mercy\\" are the two that stood out the most.  Overall, excellent album!  May not be their greatest album, but great nonetheless.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Originally we were sent the wrong movie but told we could keep \\"300\\" and they would reorder and send us the right one. This took several days to clear up the situation and my husband was not very pleased in the length of time it took to get his birthday present.  Though I appreciated their gesture of keeping the first dvd, we did not enujoy it and ultimately gave it away while waiting for Troy.  I would question doing business with them honestly.

Can not say enough nice things about the experience in ordering this product.  Efficiency says it best along with perfect quality.

It was their only bonding time and a way for a mother to reconnect with her son while far apart.  I wouldn't send anything but the best for that situation, so thank you for making it possible and a family smile.  Look forward to doing business with you again very soon.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|If you enjoyed the Robert Langdon character in \\"The Da Vince Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", I truly believe you will enjoy this story by author Dan Brown too.  I know I did.  Even if you're not a member of the fan club, you simply have to admire Brown for the obvious amount of research he has done on the locations and subject matter he describes in this book.  His colorful yet painstakingly detailed and accurate descriptions of the historic landmark buildings and monuments of Washington, D.C. were fascinating to someone who has never had the opportunity to visit the city.  I was so inspired I've started planning a vacation to D.C.!  And I hated American history as a kid!  I've never had anything more than a casual interest in the architecture of our nation's capital or any architecture for that matter, but this book has had me daydreaming lately about visiting and walking the halls of these inspirational structures for myself!<br /><br />For those who ever considered themselves a sort of weekend philosopher, Brown's thoughtful references to the relationships we've all pondered from time to time between science, religion, and ancient mysticism had me frequently nodding my head as he eloquently explained answers to theories I had often found myself wondering about during my own introspective moments.  Who hasn't asked himself questions like, \\"Why are we here?\\" and \\"What happens next?\\"?  His plausible explanations, regardless of whether you're a \\"believer\\" or whether they might be \\"fact\\" or \\"fiction\\", made me want to read on and learn more of what this author had to say about the mysteries all of us have longed to understand since man first looked to the star-filled heavens in wonder.<br /><br />I'd never heard of the Noetic Sciences before reading this book, but his description of character Katherine Solomon's chosen career and her passion for this science had me spending an entire evening doing my own research on the subject.  I have to admit, I have not been doing much leisure reading in recent years, so maybe that disqualifies me as a serious book reviewer, but my recent Kindle purchase and this, my first Kindle book, has had me coming home from work every evening the past few weeks, fixing dinner, taking care of the daily chores and finally settling in to read a few chapters of The Lost Symbol instead of channel surfing on the television.  And don't get me wrong.  I enjoy my favorite television programs and movies too, but what a great escape The Lost Symbol has been!<br /><br />Yes it's a long book and a lot of reading, but so what?  Relax, take your time, and enjoy this well written story as I did.  Download the sample and have a look for yourself.ading in recent years, so maybe that disqualifies me as a serious book reviewer, but my recent Kindle purchase and this, my first Kindle book, has had me coming home from work every evening the past few weeks, fixing dinner, taking care of the daily chores and finally settling in to read a few chapters of The Lost Symbol instead of channel surfing on the television.

OK, so he researches his subject - but when will he learn to write an interesting sentence that he hasn't written 1,000 times before? OK, there was a surprise or two, even if I should NOT have been surprised - having read him before.  I will NEVER buy another Dan Brown book again - there are too many great authors writing now to waste my time with this repetitive, mediocre writing.

030745455X|3.0|In the second installment of Larsson's Millennium trilogy, Mikael Blomkvist has come to Lisbeth Salander's rescue.  Blomkvist is working with another journalist and a doctorate student to publish an expose revealing the seedy side of Sweden, namely sex trafficking.  The book and articles to be publish threaten to take down not only pimps and johns, but also some law enforcement officials who have gotten tangled up in the trade.  However, before it can come to fruition, the journalist and his partner are killed, and, in close time proximity, so is Salander's guardian.  The only lead the police have is a gun found near one of the crime scenes, which has Salander's fingerprints, and she is quickly the one and only suspect.<br /><br />Blomkvist, along with the few others who are close to Salander argue for her innocence.  As the police dig further and further, they uncover startling facts about Salander, facts which Salander has kept private and never shared her whole life.  Is she really psychotic and deranged like all the reports have stated?  What happened to her when she was 13 that changed the rest of her life?<br /><br />The first half of the book I found somewhat boring.  I understand Salander's propensity towards math is am important part of her character, but too much time was spent on that angle.  I also found all the character's names too confusing and many of them sounded like one another.  I had to go back and figure out who was who and role s/he played.  Although I think the plot was good and intriguing, I didn't care for the execution.  Some parts were very interesting, and some parts were so boring I had to put it down and find something else to do.

Other than the technical problems, I like how well King develops his characters, they seem grounded and plausible.  Lisey and Scott's love for each other seems very real. They care for each other despite their own faults and flaws.     That being said, I can't stand the dialogue in this book.

Sometimes paper is better on the eyes too.    What I like most about this dictionary is the succinct definitions.  They are easy to understand and don't send me on a word hunt with definitions that require definitions--explain the explanation syndrome.    What I like least is the weight.  It's paper and there are a lot of definitions in it, so it is bound to be heavy.  The hard-cover keeps it together pretty well.    This is a great dictionary than I can definitely recommend.

Love Love Love it, and I really hope they reconsider and come back for a season 3, 4, 5....  I must warn you though, if you are a fan of the books DO NOT expect Legend of the Seeker to follow the exact story line in the books, it really doesn't follow it at all...The characters are the same and they go places that are mentioned in the book, but there aren't many other similarities.  If you can seperate the two and not think about the book while you're watching the show then you should enjoy it...I know I do!
0451191153|5.0|It took me a bit longer to get engaged in this Ayn Rand novel than did \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"; however, this book is no less exceptional.  \\"The Fountainhead\\", though not Rand's first book, was the novel that made her famous, and for very good reason.  It is her definitive piece.  It is her essay on what she believes to be the semblance of perfection, in the form of one man - Howard Roark.  Actually, it is the story of four different persons: one who can never succeed in life, but doesn't know it; one who can never succeed in life, and knows it (this is the archetype evil Rand character - using the ways of a socialist to achieve his ends); one who can succeed in life, but gives into the way of the world; and the hero (Roarke), who does succeed in life through his individualism and love of his work.  This is the story of the power of the individual over the collective or state.  The Fountainhead is the person who creates, no the second-hander.  Overall, the story was very engaging, though the best part was Roark's trial speech at the end of the novel.  That speech is what defines Rand.  While I certainly do not espouse all her beliefs, I can appreciate her cry for the individual - something which is very lost in today's world of massive government.  If you are interested in what all the hubbub about Rand is - you should start with \\"The Fountainhead\\".

B0030Y11XS|5.0|I've been a big fan of Michael Moore ever since \\"Roger & Me,\\" and have gone to see all his films, usually buying the DVDs as well for the new extras Moore always includes. While Moore has had a sharper focus in his other films -- gun control, the Bush administration, the plight of laid-off autoworkers -- this film looks at the big picture.    Let's be frank. If you're right of center, you're not going to like this movie. Moore is left wing all the way, and that's fine with me. He stacks the deck in his films (and this one is no exception), but not unfairly. You're seeing the unadulterated truth about capitalism here, and it sure isn't pretty. There are winners and there are losers -- lots of them -- and this film consists primarily of their stories. I have to confess that it makes me feel guilty to own holdings in some of the companies that are rightfully chastised here, and I did make some changes in my portfolio as a result. So I guess Moore is having some effect, with me anyway.    There are oodles of extras. so if you've already seen the film, there's still a good reason to buy the DVD. Can't wait to see who or what Moore puts on the chopping block next!

B001OQCV6K|4.0|I just want to throw in my 2 cents with those who thoroughly enjoyed this Holmes outing.  I was not impressed by the trailers, and I didn't think that I would take to the Guy Ritchie style of energizing the iconic character, but sorry you purists, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law won me over and even though Ritchie's typical fast-paced direction, dialogue, and muscular editing, plus the big screen action and CGI took Holmes from the quiet deducting in the drawing room to spectacular fisticuffs and Bondian action, I really didn't care because it was damned entertaining.  I very much liked the voice-over inner workings of Holmes' mind, and I enjoyed the difficulty of Holmes' character that Downey brings out so freshly. And, I am again pleased that Law's Watson has been thoroughly distanced from Nigel Bruce's bumbler.    As many have said, and I have stated in earlier reviews, I am a great fan of Jeremy Brett's Holmes series.  I believe they are truer to the Victorian era and the books, and a definitve portrayal.  However, I was surprised and delighted that the big budget, big effects Ritchie movie, despite its departures from the tone of the texts, still captured the spirit of the duo and especially Holme's elusive, difficult and enigmatic character.  In all cases, he was brilliant and high-strung, and he is here as well.  And in all cases Watson was a veteran of the Afghan wars, and a sturdy and reliable comrade, and the rock of sobriety and steadiness a mercurial figure like Holmes could fasten on.    Anyway, yeah it's Hollywood, and big and noisy and over-the-top.  But it looks great and it does get to an aspect of Holmes, as other reviewers have pointed out, that is often overlooked.  He was courageous, a skilled and adept fighter, with many talents for mayhem.  A good Victorian wouldn't glorify or elevate these traits, but they are definitely alluded to in the stories, and Holmes never shirked or hesitated going after villains who were ruthless, violent, and oftenbetter-armed.  So that confidence came from somewhere, from some real experience.  So, non-Victorian, action movie director Ritchie does dramatize and accentuate this aspect perhaps more than some would like.  Yes, the cerebral has been sacrificed to the big action pieces, but it's a movie, and it stands or falls on those elements.  I found it fast and entertaining and fun. That will do.
B000096FUD|5.0|Terry Gilliam...one of the most brilliant (and underrated) directors of our time...    ...and here we see, the man himself, in action, as he attempts to make a film about 'don quioxte'...    And so he does...    Many watch this documentary, and see a man who struggles and never succeeds, but i clearly see it as a man who achieves more than he could ever have dreamed...    Like what Al Pacino did for Shakespeare in \\"Looking For Richard\\", Gilliam does an amazing job of giving the viewer a 'complete, understandable' look at Quioxte...    The story was always about the one who tried so desperately to 'tilt at windmills' yet never succeeds...and clearly this documentary lives out what was found on Cervante's pages in a way that everyone can understand and admire...    ...and by that, he succeeds brilliantly...

1594481784|3.0|I was expecting to enjoy High Fidelity more than I actually did.  It's a highly regarded, remarkably popular novel that seemed like it would be the kind of book that would be `right up my alley'.  I am a fan of wry British humor, I'm something of a rock music enthusiast, and I firmly believe that everything in life should be ranked and put into lists and counted down - preferably in reverse order to maximize the impact of revealing the number 1 pick.<br /><br />And I did like all those things about the novel.  The lists, the art of making a perfect compilation tape, the obsessive ordering and re-ordering of one's record collection all made me laugh at myself, because I've done all those things.  And the novel is very funny, in a typically British way, as anticipated.  The only real downside is that it's protagonist, the 30-something owner of a failing record store, is a maddeningly self-absorbed whiner.  True, some of his whining is amusing, but it wears thin after a while.<br /><br />The Plot:  Rob is stuck in a state of inertia and is bemoaning the changes in the world around him as the people in his life move on while he remains unchanged.  We meet Rob as his girlfriend leaves him and  watch as he simultaneously pines for her and keeps his eye out for other prospects.  He is a man who prides himself on his 'averageness', considering it to be one of his greatest virtues.  He has a fear of intimacy and struggles with commitment. He is superficial and is unable to be friends with, or date someone, who has poor taste in music.  High Fidelity is about Rob's eventual transition from self absorbed immaturity to a more mature human being who learns to take the first tentative steps towards accepting responsibility for his relationships.<br /><br />The bottom line: High Fidelity is good but not great.  There are laugh-out-loud moments and Hornby does a great job of providing insight into the mind of men who fear commitment.  As a fan of popular culture, I enjoyed all the banter about movies and music, and the numerous Top 5 lists Rob and the staff at the record shop compile (although I have to admit I was indifferent to the list of Top 5 Episodes of Cheers).  I just wish Rob hadn't been so pathetic.  I wanted to give him a shake and say \\"It's not all about you, man.  Suck it up.  Get on with it.  Nobody likes a whiner.\\"<br /><br />If High Fidelity were a Beatles song it would be Octopuses Garden.

B000MMN6YS|5.0|I read some reviews on this film and decided to pick it up on DVD a few years ago and I am so glad I did. This movie got essentially no promotion in the US so I am surprised that I even stumbled onto it. This film had me hooked right from the ugly beginning of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's birth in the most vile and repugnant place imaginable.    The narration by John Hurt is tremendous and intriguing, as is the film's musical score. I found the score's instrumentation, coupled with the operatic female voicing, quite beautiful, immersive and evocative.    Make no mistake, this is a dark story that is not for everyone. I feel the twisted tale is told in about the most filmic and gorgeous way possible, given the uncomfortable subject matter. The cinematography is amazing, as is the direction of photography throughout the film. The colors pop off the screen, particularly the doomed and gorgeous red haired beauty in the film. Take notice the depth, detail and color in her eyes, skin, clothes and hair, I was awestruck.    This movie comes with a strong recommendation from this viewer, although my tastes are admittedly more towards the dark and macabre. However, there is an abundance of grace and majesty in this fairytale that is sure to appeal to any astute film fan.    The film's video transfer is very solid and looks great with few issues. Color and depth are superb, along with solid black levels throughout.    The film's primary audio tracks are DTS HD - HR (no lossless track exists on this disc) in English and German. All the extras are in German as well. The higher bit rate DTS lossy tracks do a solid job and are an improvement to the lower bite rate DD lossy track on the US DVD release. Surround activity is very limited; perhaps a full lossless codec would improve this, it's hard to say.    I would think that a US Blu Ray release of this film will come eventually but who knows when that will be; since this movie has little recognition in the domestic US. If you are afan of Perfume, this release is a substantial upgrade to the existing DVD and well worth adding to your collection.    This imported Blu Ray played perfectly in my US Region A Sony BD player so there is no region lock on this disc. I picked up a copy for $27, including shipping, from a UK seller on ebay so be sure to shop around before spending $40+ on this disc from Amazon or another seller.    Highly recommended
0307266303|5.0|This is a great book, and I can't thank you enough for Mr.McDougall for really opening my eyes about all the pain I experience after running for the last 2 years.And thanks for amazon for delivering the book all the way here to Bali of Indonesia. I wore premium USA sport shoes, NIKE.And for the last 2 years I experienced mild pain while running.Back few months ago I thought that maybe my pain will disappear if I buy newer shoes with much much better cushioning /more expensive shoes. I always looking at cynical when I meet those people in the park while I run who are wearing flat sport shoes,,sandals or converse shoes while running.I always thought maybe they can't afford to buy shoes with good cushioning.But then I also wondering how come they run faster than me and longer than me and those people look like they don't experience pain while running with those very minimal cushioning shoes/ sandals. Now thanks to this book,,,I understand.Great job, Mr.McDougall
B002VPE1B6|2.0|First, let me say that the special effects were incredible, stunning, eye-popping, etc etc etc. I can't even imagine how they can do all that and make it look so real. I was very glad to have Blu-Ray.<br /><br />But having said that, what was left of the film? A cliche-ridden comic-strip sci-fi of the old school that was actually laughable in parts. Here we are, in some distant future, in a world where \\"Gyrenes\\" talk and act straight out of a Rambo movie. The dialog was ridiculous -- and could they get the guns any bigger? Naturally, the end had to come down to a showdown between hero and supervillain (and, gee, who is going to win????)<br /><br />Take Dances with Wolves, throw in some reruns of The A-Team, stir with a smidgen of Terminator and video game robot war machines -- give them all a good dose of steroids -- and voila, you have Avatar.<br /><br />The worst part was that, in a film purportedly rhapsodizing the goodness of a simple peaceful people living in harmony with their world, the victory goes to the side who can kill the most of the \\"others.\\" Well, ain't that an enlightened message?<br /><br />Such a disappointment.

Debunks the myth of the sanctity of the self-regulated \\"free market.\\" One tiny clip of the Goldman CEO on the balcony of the White House telling President Reagan to \\"Hurry it up,\\" and Reagan ducking his head in submission, tells it all. That is the behavior of a bully...an abuser, and his submissive victim, underscoring that that's what corporations become when left to their own devices.
B002RAREAK|1.0|I really feel that Usher is the like Taylor Swift.  He uses his personal drama to TRY to sell CDs.
B0036BDQ6U|1.0|It's unbelievable how this was trotted out to the public as a high-quality repress/remaster. The LP 2 plays way off center, to the point of being unlistenable. I don't just mean my copy; I mean ALL of them, as I've tried several copies shipped from multiple locations, all returned. Stay away from \\"Far Beyond Driven\\", too; Every single copy skips. Shame on whoever works in quality control at the sham of a record plant that pressed these. They better get things straight for the other Pantera releases in fall 2010.
B002IKLMN4|5.0|This book is about timing and for me it was perfect. It gives me motivation, it made me think about what I want to do. Basicly, teaches when to quit and when to stick, but won't tell you what to do now, you and only you know.   I highly recommend.    If you always wanted to be the best in what you are doing.  If you feel you're doing too much things at the same time.  If you start a lot of projects but never finish them.     This book is for you.    ===  If you think you are the best.  If you think you know when to quit.  If you think the book will decide for you when to quit and when to stick.    This book is not for you.
B00000IQW3|5.0|Whereas some are simply content to save the world, \\"The Last Starfighter\\" aspires to saving the universe; the way this comes about is the theme of this movie.<br /><br />The future hero is presented as a young man on the road to nowhere; frustrated by his circumstances he has developed phenomenal skills with a particular video game. Unknown to him, the video game he has excelled in is connected to a universal search for those few with the natural skills to pilot a starfighter.<br /><br />His amazing ability results in a visit from an alien, ably played by Robert Preston, who invites him to join the forces of good to help in defeating the forces of evil. He has a beautiful girlfriend, played by Catherine Mary Stewart, whose presence complicates his decision as to what he should do.<br /><br />The adventures which follow include light-speed trips to space stations, meetings with many alien races and the challenge they all face in confronting a determined enemy.<br /><br />The movie is fun to watch and has a very satisfying ending; I don't think I'll spoil the ending by saying the forces of good triumph over the forces of evil, thanks in no small part to our young hero.<br /><br />Regardless of which version you buy, this one is a worthy addition to the library of any sci-fi enthusiast.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Where do I start with this film?    The picture quality so darn good it was like I was there in the Avatar. I really thought I was on Pandora when I was watching this. Sure, I've got a lot of Blu-Ray movies in my vault, but this one is like no other.    Buy this film, you wont be disappointed. The disc played without any problems at all on all of my Blu-Ray players which include the Playstation 3, and the Sony BDP-S550.    Thank you FOX for this great flick. 5/5 stars!
B002NXSRVG|2.0|I can't say I had high expectations for any movie based on GI Joe action figures. I used to love playing the figures as a kid, but it just simply isn't movie material. [[ASIN:B002NXSRVG G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]] is probably the best they could do given the concept, but the result isn't very satisfying. It's an action movie galore, but not much else. The script gets a bit corny and cliche, with predictable lines and plot developments - like the hot GI Joe Scarlett also being the scientific nerd. I was also surprised [[ASIN:B002NXSRVG G.I. Joe]] features so many hot characters. I don't remember anybody like Sienna Miller's character in my action figures when I was younger! Unfortunately, it seems part of a larger problem with the movie - it is more focused on delivering eye candy (both special effects and hot actresses) than delivering a good movie.
B00328G4XY|1.0|Electric Ladyland is a fantastic musical journey, showcasing Jimi Hendrix's genius as a guitarist, singer, poet, and composer.  My 1* review is for Amazon's infuriating pricing of this product. Just over one month ago, this CD was selling for $8.99 on Amazon. Over the past month they have raised the price to $12.49. That's an outrageous 39% price increase in 30 days! Obviously Amazon is not paying the record label 39% more - they are simply gouging their customers by raising the price at a time when overall inflation is an ultra-low 2%. I put this item in my cart thinking that I would buy it later when I had accumulated a few other items to purchase. No way will I pay an extra 39%! Amazon loses a sale by giving in to greed.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I thought overall this was a surprisingly decent adaptation of Sherlock Holmes - given that it's a big-budget Hollywood flick. Unfortunately, Sherlock Holmes does inject a lot of fighting scenes and make Holmes a bit of an action hero. In several scenes, he has to fight with his bare fists.<br /><br />However, I think Sherlock Holmes does preserve the essential attributes of Holmes - the cold demeanor, the keen observer, and the ability to piece together disparate pieces of evidence to come to brilliant conclusions. By the middle of the movie, I could see Robert Downey Jr. as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes. I was as crazy about Jude Law's Dr. Watson - he seemed a bit too normal and drab.<br /><br />The plot was a bit odd. The world is threatened by a secret cult - a decidedly un-Holmesian case. However, the twists and turns were in keeping with those in the books. There are several mysteries which initially seem supernatural or impossible, but Holmes then unravels them calmly and coolly.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't say this is a great adaptation of Doyle's novels. I'd prefer a movie that had a less action, more cerebral feel to it. Nonetheless, given today's Hollywood, I'm glad somebody did a reasonable attempt to bring Holmes and Dr. Watson to life.
0385504225|1.0|Imagine an 18-hour plane ride sitting next to an old man who is bound and determined to tell you the details of every History Channel program he has ever watched in his lifetime.  That pretty much sums up The Lost Symbol.    I, unfortunately, ignored the harsh reviews thinking this book couldn't be any worse than the other Dan Brown books.  Since finishing The Lost Symbol I've been trying really hard to think of a book I disliked more.  So far, I haven't come up with one.    I experienced The Lost Symbol in its audiobook form.  If I'd bought the actual book I would never have finished it.  I usually zip through audiobooks during my commute to work but this one was pure mental drudgery.  I think I may have even lost a few IQ points trying to rationalize the ridiculous plot.    The premise of the book is just plain silly.  Remember in the other Dan Brown books where there was a big revelation at the end that really drove home the story?  Well, there is no revelation in this book.  Nothing.  It's just hour after hour of shallow characters reciting text book babble.  Why would you want to engage in a scholarly debate when people's lives are at stake?  None of the characters seemed the least bit worried about the impending deaths of their loved ones, at least not worried enough to stop prattling on about Masonic history long enough to call the police.  I know, all part of the suspension of disbelief, but suspending this much disbelief makes my head hurt.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Once you get past the first two episodes, the rest of season 2 is outstanding.  \\"Belle Chose\\" & \\"Getter Closer\\" are positively brilliant.
0670034711|1.0|I was tempted by the catchy title of this book...and very disappointed with it's contents. I felt that it was not at all well written....even a bit frightening.      It took this poor woman way too long to cut her losses and move on, the prolonged drama and bathroom floor blubbering was too much for me. The author seemed very self centered and immature. I found it a struggle to continue reading. I kept hoping it would get better....unfortunately...it didn't. It dragged on...and on....and on.      The thing that frightened me more were the readers who felt    that this book changed their lives...there was absolutely nothing life changing about it for me.        I will admit that I did like \\"Richard from Texas\\"...and the old magic man in Indonesia...they both saved me from completely hating this book.             Let's face it...if you were in a stale relationship and someone handed you 200K to travel the world and think about what went wrong and write a book about it...chances are you'd get over him real quick...eat some decent food, drink some good wine, visit a spa, do some yoga...and meet some guy to play with. The only thing life changing about that is to miraculously come up with the time and the money to do it.       Thumbs down for this one...hope the next book is better.....
B002A4Q652|4.0|I first heard the single \\"April Rain\\" on Pandora and I simply was hooked by a very catchy song.  I see reviews disappointed that this album turned out to be more like pop than metal and I harbored that very same fear which is why I hesitated to buy the entire album.  I caved in for a long road trip and I'd say it's not what I expected it to be based on my Pandora station criteria, but I found it to be a very enjoyable album.  It's somewhere between Evanescence and The Corrs with vocals that reminded me more of Nightwish post Tarja.  Not symphonic metal when compared to bands like Nightwish or Within Temptation but I didn't care.  Lots of good tracks on it if you find yourself enjoying a sound described as above.  Of course, the title track is one of the catchiest, but I really liked \\"I'll Reach You\\", \\"Lost\\", \\"Invidia\\" and \\"Vice & Virtue.\\"  The lyrics are not on the mystical side of a lot of symphonic metal I've heard but more about human emotions and relationships which I like just as well.  The rest of the album is pretty good, but the above are the most notable.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Welcome to Pandora.<br /><br />This movie really lets it rip. Its a real kick in the seat of your pants flick. I am elderly, so unfortunately I cannot get to the movie theaters, so i waited for this to come out on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I highly, highly, recommend this movie for anyone into animation or just someone who wants an amazing experience. My home theater has 7 speakers surround sound and this movie really shook the house >>>> Ask my neighbor if you dont believe me!<br /><br />My Avatar movie played fine a small update was needed but took me around 10 minutes (if that) to do, and I am 73 years of age.
B0035WTJFW|5.0|This is a review of the BD version of the film.  I am sure most reading know the atory, so I won't get into all of that, though it must be said it is a chliing. exciting, and brilliant vision of the future down to its details.  I have seen a couple of reviews that note the issue of \\"grain\\" on the image.  Here's the deal with that...the grain is supposed to be there.  The most common misconception about bluray is that it offers a more enhanced and retouched version of a film.  High Definition lets you see the film as it was intended by the filmmakers.  Mostb SD DVD has been treated with something called Digital Noise Reduction (DNR).  This wipes the image so that it is smooth and waxy.  It also distorts the colors, textures, and the original artistic vision.  Bluray provides deeper colors, blacks, eliminates edge enhancement, halos, and other issues.  Minority Report is intended and was shot to have a gritty feel, hence the grain.  This is how the film is supposed to look.  It has a kind of washed out, skip bleached look with lots of swirling film grain.  This creates an emotional impact that informs the story and the characters.  This movie looks fabulous.  The grain renders the fine details and textures much harder to see in 480i.  1080p allows us to see it as it looked in the editing bay.  Colors are fully accurate and resolved.  Blacks are inky and detail is gorgeous, making the special effects all the more dazzling.  This transfer was closely supervised and approved by Spielberg.  It is the best this film will ever look and the HD DTS soundtrack is tight, robust and exciting.  This is one of the films I have been waiting to see in this format and it exceeded my expectations.
B00005NB8K|3.0|Surely Jim Morrison's life wasn't as debauched as Oliver Stone presents it in THE DOORS (1991). The film plays like a rock music gang bang. OK, not exactly, but if Jimmy was THAT physically active wouldn't he have had a case of terminal johnson blisters?<br /><br />Recently seeing this movie again reminded me of how handsome Val Kilmer was in his youth. Physically he makes a superb Morrison, can even sing like the man. Yes, the music is just great here and the actors playing the other members of the Doors work well in their roles.<br /><br />Crispin Glover's Andy Warhol is also interesting (in a creepy sort of way), but this film is good only up to a point. The early story works best, and then you get to that vampire sequence, geez. And how about Meg Ryan's elevator surprise? If I saw what she encountered that night I'd be outta there on the next flight to San Berdoo. Yet Pamela Courson stuck around for more heartbreak, and more, and more, and...<br /><br />Director Stone must have a message here. Surely it isn't: don't shoot too many scenes with a red filter? With Morrison/Kilmer overdrugging, overdrinking, oversexing, overeating and overschmoozing, it has to be: all things in moderation.<br /><br />In a two year period, Janis Joplin died of heroin and booze, Jim Morrison passed away in a bathtub from a heroin OD and Jimi Hendrix asphixiated while regurgitating the 9 sleeping pills he'd swallowed, which apparently was 8½ too many. All were only 27. All had made wondrous music. The word \\"tragedy\\" doesn't begin to describe how Janis, Jim and Jimi left us, and what the world lost in potential new songs as a result. Their deaths marked a turning point in music and in how we fans lived our own lives.<br /><br />Epilogue: Three years after Jim left her, Pamela Courson also died of a heroin overdose. Like the others, Pamela was only 27 years old.

0452281881|5.0|Everything said here is true. This book is absolutely incredible, especially if you've ever worked in Advertising. The story is spot-on, and the characters are people we all know ...My only minor (very, very minor) problem with this book is the very, very end. SPOILER ALERT: anyone who's worked in Advertising knows that Pinky wouldn't have gotten the \\"top\\" job. She would've been Barry's Deputy. And no, it's not a \\"sexist\\" thing at all, it's simply the way the industry works. In the book Barry was an extremely sought-after, experienced, high-level Creative Director working at a great agency. And MS is a middling agency, who would have to jump through major hoops to lure a talent like Barry. Pinky, merely a mid-level Art Director, rose to the occasion internally, which was awesome. But there's no way in Hell Barry would've taken a job answering to Pinky. No offense to her :)
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Just watch Jeff Beck playing, his touch and own personal style is amazing. He always plays with the best musicians and you can see them reacting to each other thru the songs.<br />Great video and sound, great guest stars. Well worth the price and watching over again.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|So much has been said about \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" that any more praise might seem like a case of gilding the lily, or painting the peacock. But the film remains, and will remain, one of cinema's crowning achievements. I would place it in a Top Ten List of movies.<br /><br />It's a given that Vivien Leigh (Best Actress winner here) and Marlon Brando (lost to Bogie for \\"The African Queen\\") gave outstanding performances, two of the greatest pieces of acting Hollywood ever saw. Leigh's Blanche makes me almost forget there even was a Scarlett O'Hara. Watching the phony, dependent, boozing Blanche DuBois cling so tightly to this facade she's made and then become unmasked is great to behold. What a showcase for Leigh. Brando is absolutely amazing in this role; he screams and thrashes and sneers and makes a ruckus... and then as Stanley he can turn on a dime and be a vulnerable, wounded little boy. This is such a fascinating part, so dimensional and multifaceted. And I'm sure that this performance changed the way actors viewed and created their craft.<br /><br />Another thing comes to mind: Stanley Kowalski in this film is one of the sexiest characters ever to grace the screen. He may be a slob and a brute, but this man is the ideal: the raw, seething, beautiful bad boy.<br /><br />Naturally, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden are super (both received supporting Oscar statues). These are acting professionals, clearly.<br /><br />Every time I view the film I fall in love (and pity) with Blanche and Stanley all over again... even though she's a delusional house of cards and he's a bumptious wife beater. They seem real. We've known or met people like them. And they are the focus of the conflict in this story. And conflict is what it's all about. These two opposing forces come together and cause an inferno. This is a tragedy, nearly Shakespearian. There was actually an opera made that was based on this play, in 1995. If any play/film begs for an opera I suppose this would be it. It's so fiery, and also so melancholy.<br /><br />I don't know specifically what Tennessee Williams was trying to say; however I can speculate, and I believe that he might have meant that gentle people have a tough time of it in this world-- it's a rough and tumble place, often unappealing, ugly, vulgar and loud. That's just one theory, and it may not even be valid. But of course many people have studied the play and come up with different theories on its meanings and its symbolism... from the use of light to the names of the streetcars we hear in the opening scene. Bottom line, there's much meaning here about people and the world.<br /><br />Elia Kazan's direction is wonderful; I enjoy his work (East of Eden, On the Waterfront, Gentleman's Agreement, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Baby Doll, A Face in the Crowd, etc.) His films are often very earthy, and they tackle issues and subjects other directors would scamper away from timidly. This is his masterpiece, for my money.<br /><br />The whole atmosphere of \\"Streetcar\\" is excellently rendered. Stella and Stanley's home is delightfully decrepit in its way; everything seems in a state of disrepair. This is a winner of set design and artistic touches; the place could be a haunted house if there were no characters present. There's a claustrophobia in the film that adds to the tension (this story is as tense as it gets)... the tiny apartment is guaranteed to generate some visceral goings on. Elia Kazan had a set created that had moveable walls so that as the film progressed, the walls slowly seem to close in on Blanche. The movie just oozes and drips with tension and suspense, Southern gothic stuff. A feeling of impending doom seems to bubble beneath the surface.<br /><br />The sets and the props and even the sound effects-- train sounds and such-- are terrific. Every little detail adds to the film's brilliance and its tumultuous mood. And then there's the sultry score by Alex North, which basically screams sex (and/or violence). Not only is the music loud and bawdy at times but it also has a tinge of the tragic in it. Just the opening credits alone are enormously charged simply from the music itself. But also it should be mentioned that the more quiet and subtle parts of the music are also very effective.<br /><br />Watching the movie again, I am also taken with the lighting. Whether we notice it or not, it has a large effect on the drama. Careful and meticulous choices were made, if I'm not mistaken, and it shows. It affects us, it manipulates our emotions, and it adds to the scathing drama.<br /><br />What a pleasure it is to watch \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\", whether it's the third time or the thirtieth. Even though it's such a sad tale (especially the fate of Blanche), it's an extraordinary film. It got an impressive twelve Oscar nominations (won the three acting awards, plus B&W Art Direction/Set Design).<br /><br />Somehow it never gets old, never fades (like certain Southern ladies do).

0756655307|5.0|I purchased this book at the IRA conference in Chicago--it is absolutely amazing. The pages are thick and the colors are so very vivid! Sorted alphabetically, it lists all the characters with a \\"factfile\\" (height, wiehgt, real name, occupation, first appearance)and then  \\"powers\\" and \\"allies/foes\\" for cross-referencing. I would recommend this book for any-aged Marvel fan. Mom or Dad could read it while Jr. is entertained by the awesome visuals and older children can read alone (my guess is approximately 7th-grade reading level).
B002VPE1B6|5.0|After reading the pre-reviews of others, I had decided to wait for a future release before buying this movie. I glad that I didn't! This is by far the best release that I have seen in Blu-Ray. The picture quality is far superior to any other Blu-ray release that I have screened on my system. It is truly motion picture quality (of course, not in 3-D).    The soundtrack is 5.1, but you won't be disappointed even if you have a 7.1 system. The sound is pure, and discreet with excellent separation without sounding contrived.    Honestly, I was stunned after watching (and listening) to Avatar in Blu-Ray.     You may have to upgrade the firmware in your DVD player to play this release. I have a Samsung BDP3600 Blu-ray Player purchased this past fall and I still had to upgrade the firmware. The movie takes a long time to load, longer than other titles I own, but after it does...WOW.    I haven't looked at the second disc of extras (not Blu-Ray). Will report back when I do. But for now, this is a MUST BUY, if you are into Blu-Ray, home theater, surround sound and of course the movie, Avatar!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Ok I want to start off by saying that I am not the type of person who buys a ton of movies.  I think i have purchased less than 5 movies in the last 10 years but this is one movie that I have to buy.  It has a lot of gore and violence so obviously not for young kids or anything like that but this is a great movie for a mature audience.  I gotta say there have been a lot of post apocalyptic films out there lately, and I liked a lot of them but this one is by far my favorite.  I'll sum it up by saying the great story and great acting make for a great action film.  Hope you all like it as much as I did.
0307394549|5.0|This is a lovely book to look at and every recipe I've tried so far has been  oh so tasty. Of course! what would you expect from Martha?
B002VPE1AW|4.0|First a quick paragraph about the movie itself. Is the story in \\"Avatar\\" familiar?  Sure.  But it's done well, and sharpened by several unique characters, fascinating details, and a handful of unpredictable moments.  And exciting action.  Lots of exciting action.  Oh, and I liked the playful subversion lurking just under the surface: while we're quickly told once or twice that the soldiers on Pandora are mercenaries working for a private company, the visuals clearly tell us otherwise.  This is an occupying American military force, at a place where they have no business, taking on the role of the bad guys.  Hey, maybe it was a little unfair to do that (maybe), but it was gutsy on James Cameron's part to construct his story that way, a story for a big blockbuster movie, no less, not some small political art-house film.<br /><br />Anyway, now that that's out of the way, the main reason I'm writing this review is to tell you about the DVD, as people everywhere have pretty much already seen this movie and have decided whether they like it or not.  I'm here to tell you that the good old standard DVD of \\"Avatar\\" looks spectacular.  It's one of the most cleanest, sharpest transfers I've ever seen.  In many ways it's even better than the 3D version of \\"Avatar\\" seen in theaters, because as good as the Cameron's 3D process was, there was still a little inherent-to-3D murkiness here and there that sometimes inhibited the sharpness.  Here things are sharp and clear from beginning to end.  And because the movie was composed as a movie first and a 3D movie second (there are no cheap \\"comin at ya\\" shots), I found that I didn't even miss the 3D while watching the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're hesitating to buy the standard DVD of \\"Avatar\\" because you're worried that only the Blu-Ray version or the future 3D Blu-Ray version of \\"Avatar\\" will do the film justice, there's no need to worry.  This will tide you over just fine.
B000C20VPA|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />One of Scorsese's best, Casino is a classic due not only to his tight direction and a great script from Pileggi (based on his book), but DeNiro and Pesci at their best, and the only really good performance I've ever seen from Stone.<br /><br />Based on real-life mobsters Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro, Casino gets a little ways beneath the glittering surface of Vegas to show some of what was going on with the (wise)guys who used to run the show there. DeNiro is pretty much perfect and Pesci likewise, though I'm guessing from the books I've read on Tony the Ant that he was not quite as pleasant as he's depicted here. Sharon Stone is the big surprise, though, as she's as good at being Ginger as she could possibly be. Perhaps the role is just typecasting; in any case, she nails it, and every guy she can on the way. But it's DeNiro who looms over all, not just in the story but in the talent department.<br /><br />Someone once wrote that Bob isn't a great actor, as he \\"just plays the same New York ahole in every movie\\". I don't know about that, but he certainly defines this character with much precision, and makes him rather likeable, no mean feat. While not quite up to the level of Travis Bickle or Jake LaMotta or the early Vito Corleone, this is easily one of DeNiro's best roles and Casino is worth watching just for him. James Woods is a dead-on sleazeball, Frank Vincent plays to a T the exact same role he has in almost everything he's ever done (the strong, silent wiseguy always walking a few steps behind the Boss), and it's funny to see Oscar Goodman doing in a movie what he did for decades the in real life: defending mobsters in Vegas court. Before he became the Mayor of Vegas, that is. I wonder how he got that job...<br /><br />Add in a funny, sharp script, superb camerawork with all the garish oranges and other hues that were Vegas in the 70s/80s, and good turns by almost every actor in the film, and you've got a near-perfect film. It's perhaps a little long at almost three hours, but drags very little. In some ways you're sad to see Casino end, even after five viewings. The new dvd transfer is pretty much perfect, with all the bright tones intact and nice deep blacks. No special features to speak of, but that's now standard: make the suckers buy the blu-ray, even if the old dvd had plenty of extras!<br /><br />Casino is based on a true story, but reverts to fiction when discussing how the Mob was run out of Vegas.

B00371QQ34|5.0|The Jackal is one of my favorite movies of all time.  This review is not of the movie, but some technical aspects.  As far as the picture, the 1080p is a stunning improvement over dvd.  Content is one double sided flipper disc: one side the BD, the other the dvd.  You can't play both at the same time, but fortunately I have my old single dvd copy which I'm keeping.  You may be wondering why?  Because Universals put the director audio commentary, as well as extras (the making of), on the dvd, not the BD side!  Very frustrating.  Fortunately I have 2 BD players to run both if I ever need the 2nd audio channel while watching the BD.  However, the BD side does include 2 features which aren't a big deal: BD-live ticker (pop up facts), which you'll need online connection to.  And scene access, by using the 4 colored buttons on your remote.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen the series before, but I heard it was good, so I finally broke down and purchased it. I was not disappointed. The characters were great. The story line was original and cool. The show was humorous and fun to watch. I only wish the series was never cancelled. I will have no problem watching this one over again. You'll have to pry the DVD's from my cold dead hands. Awsome show. I really don't understand why such good shows get cancelled. If you are a scifi fan you have to watch this one.
038533348X|5.0|This book is so obscenely entertaining and readable that I don't feel qualified to review it.  I read it in three sittings the first time and two sittings the second time.  I will read it again soon, I'm sure.  Busy, busy, busy.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a great movie. Picks up where Firefly left off, and closes out the story like I'm sure the series would have done over several years. I saw the movie on the big screen and was impressed by its' originality, characters (like real people with flaws and unique senses of humor), special effects -of course, and storyline (not just made to show us how cool CGI can be). A very entertaining movie. Once again, you will have to pry this DVD from my cold dead hands. Makes me wish I lived in that universe if not Star Wars.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|First off don't let the title confuse you, the Specials are actually an important bridge between the 4th and 5th season of the New Doctor series, including the introduction of a very important character. The episodes by it self are damn impressive. Seeing the doctor face off with increasingly harder choices and the need to break his own rules.    I would recommend this product for all who follow the adventures of the Doctor.

0307269760|4.0|To enter an Alice Munro story, you must be prepared to venture into alien worlds--not as in a science fiction world, but worlds, minds, and experiences that you don't expect. Through the minds of Munro's characters, you encounter what seems like the ordinary details we all are familiar with--a business meeting, rooming with a girlfriend, summer camp. But the reader may be surprised by the angles that begin to jut out of what appears to be the core of the story, just as you think you understand the basic idea, such as a story about a man and woman living off the land--a well matched couple, according to the point of view of the woman. Then, as you sink into the particulars of their life together, the story breaks and we find ourselves in the period of another story years later, following the enticing, yet slightly confusing breadcrumbs of promise that we will be, in the end, either satisfied or enlightened.<br /><br />Munro does all the things that short story writers are cautioned not to do; she covers great swaths of time, she summarizes huge chunks of story. She changes point of view several times, and skips back and forth in time, weaving a narrative that not only requires your full attention but also makes you bring all your intelligence to it. While you are in the process of sorting and trying to understand what is going on, you find that you must let go of your previous notions and expectations of story, characters, epiphanies, and denouements. It's in the gap created somehow by Munro's tightly woven prose--broken up by questions, asides, and illogical conclusions--that you are whisked away to some other level of consciousness, to the mysteries in the story. While this story itself seems to unwind naturally, out of the corner of your eye tiptoe characters, plot points, and insights you could never have predicted, waylaying you with an \\"aha,\\" a pain in the ribs, or a curious restlessness that makes you keep turning the pages.<br /><br />The stories are enigmatic--the title story Too Much Happiness left me confused but curious enough to reread it; and other stories seemed to beckon with the promise of resolution, only to leave me surprised at the secrets revealed as if the characters had been turned inside out while I wasn't looking.<br /><br />These stories by Alice Munro are not casual reading--they make demands of you, forcing you to wrestle with their dark revelations. But in them, you find yourself--secret bits that you would never reveal to a soul. Munro captures and excavates these secret moments and lays them open to us. Moreover, you will be changed by them, if you can suspend your judgments and expectations. Perhaps that is her point.<br /><br />by Linda Joy Myers<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womenry Too Much Happiness left me confused but curious enough to reread it; and other stories seemed to beckon with the promise of resolution, only to leave me surprised at the secrets revealed as if the characters had been turned inside out while I wasn't looking.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|I guess I am in the minority of reviewers here when I say I am a Paul Rodgers fan first, Queen a distant second. So all the reservations that Queen fans had about the band recording new material without Freddy, I felt the same for Paul. Why would he do it and open himself up to the criticisms that are sure to follow? Well, he's an artist and he likes to make new music and he wanted to try something with Roger and Brian and I think Cosmos Rocks is a pretty good effort from the three. I have to admit, the first listen through, I didn't much care for it; where Queen fans heard \\"too much Bad Company\\", I heard way too much Queen and not enough of Paul's influence. After several listens though, I developed an appreciation for most of the songs, particularly We Believe, Some Things That Glitter, Voodoo, Warboys, (which Paul wrote and first recorded on his Live in Glasgow solo cd), and Cosmos Rockin'. All in all I think it's a nice combination of the musical styles of the three men and in my opinion worth owning for both Queen and Paul Rodger fans.

0385528752|5.0|If you're interested in the topic of catalyzing change and/or you consider yourself to be any sort of change agent, then \\"Switch\\" will, in all likelihood, turn out to be the most important book of the year.<br /><br />The authors practice what they preach. They make this critical topic accessible, understandable, and actionable.<br /><br />I'm about to start re-reading it. It's *that* good. Seriously.<br /><br />My highest, unqualified recommendation.
076532413X|4.0|In the future, two researchers manage to show everyone on Earth what their own world will be like in three decades. This prompts some people to try to change things, some to find favor with the results, some to wonder what this all means, and a myraid of other reactions. It also prompts people to look into the matter, trying to see what this all means - and if anything can be done about the worlds they've glimpsed.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, I would have to say that you should skip the book. It isn't that the book is good - it is that the book will tell you things you don't want to know yet. Wanna find out what is going to happen in a few hundred pages? Well, you can. You can have your own personal Flash Foward.<br /><br />As far as the book goes, there are pros and cons to it. The major con I have is that specific characters just didn't interest me. They were written well, sure, and they had a lot to offer. But their lives were things that took the story and slowed it down for me.<br /><br />The postitives were that the story had the opposite effect as well, with characters that seemed to kick in the world while looking for answers. I liked the way they were written, their style if you will, and that made me want to keep on keeping on. I learned a ot about the experiment, about what has happened, and about why they saw a show here as well.<br /><br />I liked the book and would say check it out. That is UNLESS you are watching the show. Now that I have read the book, I know a few things that bother me. I guess we all have to live with our own brands of the future.
B00005JLRT|4.0|OK, so we had several things going on here.  The story tends to plod along and does not really gel like some of the earlier Trek films.<br /><br />Picard discovers that the Romulans experimented and created a clone of Picard (Jinsan) except this clone was discarded to Remus.  The story centers around family, or tries to.<br /><br />The conflict between brothers, between \\"siblings\\" as it were, was a valiant try, but failed for me.<br /><br />The performances fell flat -- the ramming of the ship into the \\"theta radiation\\" ship of Jinsan was not the best idea.  The conflicted Data dealing with his Data wannabe.  And Data's final fate was a disappointment.<br /><br />Imagine if you will a director who really wants to off the franchise.  To really make this the last Star Trek film.  The Generation is getting lazy and slow.  The plot devices are getting stale and silly.<br /><br />I feel this film was the final straw for Paramount.  The film was made for fans rather than a wider fan base.<br /><br />And that's why JJ Abram's film Star Trek was the best -- it cleaned up this tired malaise of the Captain, the crew, the explosions, the last minute or else we die plot lines and breathed new life into the franchise.<br /><br />Nemesis is the reason why!<br /><br />Decent performances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis.<br /><br />The director Stuart Baird knew nothing of Star Trek or its franchise before this film, so that might explain the cold reception at the box office.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|Simply the best Christmas movie of all-time !!!!! Excellent performance by Jimmy Stewart !!!!

No matter who you are or what kind of movies you like, you should enjoy \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\"
076532413X|3.0|I enjoyed the hard science aspects of the book, despite its unusual number of typos (proof that even mainstream publishing needs line editing) and Sawyer's penchant for callous heroes. I was lucky in that I'd never heard of the TV series and so was not distracted by comparing the book to it.<br /><br />By callous heroes, I mean the Japanese engineer's decision to leave her dead child in the street (to the care of strangers) so she can get back to work. It was of a piece with the hero of Calculating God who decides that his spiritual enrichment justifies leaving his children to grow up without him. It's really just Sawyer's hell-bent determination to move his plot at whatever cost.<br /><br />But the physics-philosophy of this tale---Is the future immutable? Is free will an illusion?---is worth the effort to overlook the flaws. Even the Canadian author's usual digs at American gun ownership and lack of socialized medicine. When authors like Sawyer reach a certain peak of fame, not only does the editing of their books suffer, but they feel free to push their politics. Pity that.

B00000IQV7|4.0|\\"Patch Adams\\" is a wonderful film. It really has two genre's, Comedy and Drama.    The Film starts out with Hunting \\"Patch\\" Adams (Robin Williams) who checks himself into a mental hospital due to depression and thoughts of suicide. During his stay, Patch helps his roommate acheive a great goal, which is where he realizes he wants to help people.   Patch attends a school to become a doctor. Through his schooling, he is faced with many people that say he is not serious enough to be a doctor. Patch however never gave up on his goal.    What makes \\"Patch Adams\\" so good is that it really is not fiction. I personally agree that sometimes the best thing one can do is get someone to laugh.    Robin Williams was a perfect choice for the role of Hunting \\"Patch\\" Adams.
B000000OXH|5.0|The self titled Asia has 2 superb tracks Heat Of The Moment and Without You, but the rest is uninspiring.  1983s Alpha is another matter entirely, I listerned all the way through from Don't Cry to Open Your Eyes and it holds together very well.  5 stars with no problem at all especially if you enjoy 1980s rock, lyrics are included in the booklet too !
B00000637V|5.0|The reason for all this?, it's Transformer heads who expected another Transformer, but he did something different, he did something demanding, something pure and compelling. The same thing happened to The Clash with  Sandinista!, rockers want rock and nothing that needs thought and reeks with compassion.<br /><br />As you can read I feel very strongly about this, it really annoys me. This is easily, without doubt lou Reed's greatest piece of work that should be hailed and revered after! compare it to transformer and the latter looks like complete filler-r-us!<br /><br />Please buy it if you have taste, it's really mesmerising and rewards with constant experience.
0143038419|1.0|I read this book during a pleasure-reading binge on vacation...and it sucked all the \\"pleasure\\" out it.  I found myself throwing the book down in disgust and venting to friends about how unbelivably annoying the author's writing voice was.  The only parts that held my attention at all were the food descriptions in Italy--and that was probably because I was hungry at the time.  I would describe the writing style of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" as masturbatory...it's like Elizabeth Gilbert horn-tooting and boo-hooinig and ha-hah'ing...awful!  What a letdown.

I seriously thought that this was a 'lost classic' from the 50's until I did my research. Retro-recording with vintage equipment, vocals pegged in the red/distorted and just a primal sound. Like another reviewer mentioned--a cross between The Sonics and Little Richard--toss in The Ramones, AC/DC (The Rocker in 1:30!!)--As The Dictators asked in one of their songs-'Who Will Save R & R'- I think NC can--get healthy Nick and see you in Cleveland this summer
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Explosions, human sacrifice, and violence, oh my! Downey was an interesting Holmes, but ultimately miscast. Law was very strange as Watson. The plot was very silly. The women were completely rewritten characters. Irene Adler was an actress, not a thief. She was of sterling character and brilliant. Both qualities attracted Holmes. To portray Watson as a brawler was a stretch. His shoulder-or-leg war injury (it varied in the stories) made him more of a retiring fellow than Law portrayed him. He was brave, but I don't remember him fighting in any of the stories. He carried a revolver and I think a cane sometimes for protection. Holmes was an expert in boxing, stick fighting, and a martial art. I don't think Holmes would have fought in an illegal bare-knuckle match, he was an amateur boxer.     The CGI was bad in spots. The action was non stop and ultimately mind numbing. The deductions seemed silly at times, others they did steal from the books. The camera angles and movement were interesting sometimes and very distracting other times. The sets and scenery were okay.    In summary, the movie referenced the stories better than I thought they would. Making both Watson and Holmes more active was interesting. I thought Rathbone in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was spot on. In the other movies, Rathbone's Holmes became cartoonish. Downey did good things with Holmes, but he just didn't work for me. Law as Watson was just plain silly. Both actresses were very good. Lestrade was pretty good. The biggest drawback is that the plot was predictable and silly.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|The dual triggers work very well for games with heavy L2/R2 use, such as shooters, where there's a steady flow to the game, however intense.  BUT, if you're playing a game with panic moments, they'll snap right off when you hammer the controller.<br /><br />I had no problems keeping them on the L2/R2 buttons while playing Killzone 2, but when I started playing Demon's Souls, I was launching them all over the freaking room, and had to eventually take them off all together. As anyone who's played DS knows, there are quite a few panic moments, because death is not a pretty thing in that game. In sum, they're not a perfect solution for all games, but when they work, they definitely improve the controller experience.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful movies you will ever experience watching. The story line is wonderful. the world of pandora is very intense with bright colors, animals and vegatation. the navi are very unique looking but the 1:78:1 aspect ratio does wonders to bring out the nice blue texture of their skin. James Cameron did a wonderful job with this movie and has made pandora a place where all who have watched it would have wanted to visit.James cameron has just raised the bar in what it means to make a movie. I think that this is definately worth watching and anyone who doesn;t watch this movie is robbing themselves of one of the greatest experiences that will ever come to bluray. The romance that is build up in the movie is truly one for the ages, even though it was brief it could be felt through out the entire movie. james cameron and all who help make this movie possible, job well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000OMB|3.0|In 1982 Asia were formed with Geoffrey Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Whetton, all talented and seasoned professionals.  The result, for me is 2 great songs and the remainder disappointing.  Heat Of The Moment and Without You are defintely classic 1980s rock songs, real standouts, however I could not get excited about the rest, hence 3 stars.

If you want to get to a deeper level in your musicianship, read this book. Music is spiritual - that's inescapable. Are you keenly aware of this? Or do you think that's a lot of gobbly goop? Either way, read this book. If you want to understand the types of things that MASTERS of music meditate about music, read this book. I've bought this book 4 times for musician friends. I think it should be required reading for every jazz performance college curriculum in the nation.

B00328G4Y8|3.0|Unlike many of my classmates in high school, I never worshipped Jimi Hendrix. Oh, I liked him just fine but there was a lot of other music out there far more interesting to me at the time. I did buy Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland on vinyl, but Axis Bold As Love always seemed kind of weak to me. Though it found Hendrix wading into a more experimental sound, it was certainly no match for the debut. Fast-forward forty years and you will find me buying on CD some of the acclaimed albums I skipped for some reason back in the day, sometimes only just to listen again and discover whether my ever-expanding musical tastes find them more enjoyable now. Axis Bold As Love is one of those and after listening again I find that though I like it more than I did, I still find it rather weak in view of what came both before and after.  There are a couple of cuts I like pretty well, including the lamentably abbreviated Little Wing, the driving Little Miss Lover, and the poorly mixed If Six Was Nine. The booklet tells the story of how that last one was put together after Hendrix lost (!!!) some of the tapes and claims that it was fixed. Are they kidding? It sounded better on the Easy Rider soundtrack! Still, it remains one of the best songs on the album.  As for the other cuts, the worst is EXP which I find to be downright silly. The band must have been awful high to come up with that and think it worthy of inclusion on an album. Many other songs sound like Hendrix was trying to hard to be on the cutting edge and end up sounding sorely dated instead. This is especially noticeable where Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell are singing back-up.  As with the other remastered albums in this series, Axis Bold As Love comes with an interesting DVD that offers the fan an inside look at how the record was made as well as an attractive booklet that contains lyrics, an essay on the making of the album, and lots of pictures. So even if you are just a lukewarm Hendrix fan, there is value enough here for you to buy it just to have it and maybe even occasionally enjoy it.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was my favorite season so far, but I think I say that every season. I thought  John Lithgow was brilliant as Trinity, and I love that there is always a \\"bad\\" serial killer pitted against Dexter's \\"good.\\" There were a few times this season that I couldn't watch because the scenes were too graphic (which isn't surprising for a Showtime series). The scene when Trinity kills with a hammer was one of them.      Spoiler alert: I cannot wait to see what happens next season now that Rita is gone. It'll be interesting to see how Dexter copes without her around. I was personally getting a little sick of Dexter with a family, but I did always like Rita and was sad to see her go. All in all, fantastic, unique series that I recommend to everyone.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|If you have seen the trailers for this movie, you know that this Sherlock Holmes has very little to do with the beloved character from the books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who is typically portrayed as a somewhat snooty intellectual. Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Richie team up in this movie to bring us a completely new version of Holmes. He is buff, corky and crude, and his British accent is somewhat questionable. This being said, the film moves along swiftly and keeps the viewers entertained along the way. The central villain of this film is a cartoonish cardboard cutout with delusions of grandeur, but we do see a promising prospect for a much better antagonist for the sequel - professor Moriarty. I could really do without the bro-mance between Holmes and Watson that strives for a cool nonchalance. Jude Law plays it with a straight face despite the rather dubious jealousy of Holmes towards Watson's upcoming engagement. Overall, this film was made miles better than it could have been by the great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and even Rachel McAdams. It is definitely worth a rent and I am looking forward to the sequel.

0446563048|4.0|For anyone interested how a business grows big, really big, then Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh is the book for you. It tells the poignant story of the birth, growth and sale of Zappos to Amazon. However, it is more than a just a biography of the company, it is rather a chronicle of how an ethical company can grow and mature in any business.  Whether you are interested in order fulfillment processes, branding or building a unique corporate culture this book provides a good guideline. Full of insights and anecdotes, Hsieh delivers a thoughtful account of his career from student to CEO of Zappos. A particularly good read for business students or young entrepreneurs.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Great book, but the Kindle edition is a huge rip off. It's obvious the publisher just tossed a copy in a scanner and didn't even bother to read through what came out on the other side. Ail instead of all, tmst instead of trust, etc. Many pages have more than one typo per page.<br /><br />Update: Apparently, the publisher has fixed the typos and the Kindle version is safe to buy now. I will not be updating stars because I did not experience the updated version and I don't want to reread the book again to confirm. It is the publishers responsibility to fix this kind of thing before they take their customers money.

1439153663|5.0|With THE KITCHEN HOUSE author Kathleen Grissom delivers a page turner filled with action, drama and intensity but even moreso emotion, believable characters and a story that has a heartwrenching reality.  Books with the plots centering on slavery are easy to come by but a new perspective is found here.  This novel is about slavery and both sides of a plantation family - the owners and the workers.  But what is unique is it is told by the perspective of two main characters not often found in such novels.  We have Lavinia, an orphaned white girl who is brought back to the plantation to work with the help.  She is not part of the main family and even though her skin color is white she lives among and becomes a slave.  Then we see things through the eyes of slave Belle, who is a half white/half black illegitimate child of the master of the house.<br /><br />As the years progress much happens to both these women and a story that could have merely been yet another take on slavery becomes a story that delves deeply into family, commitment, loyalties and how sometimes in even the most difficult times, like the slavery ridden 1700s, sometimes color becomes not the most important issue.  With all this we do get a very realistic look at the trials and tribulations of both sides - the help and the owners and choices they are forced to make based on their position.  Of course when the subject is slavery an honest depiction must be given and here we get that full force.  This story is rife with suspense and raw emotion.  The addition of questions at the end to assist using this book in a book reading club is immensely helpful and the questions are insightful.  This novel is filled with much to contemplate and perfect for book clubs to devour.  As with all quality fiction, whatever the time period or situations, main themes are always timely.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I suppose that by now, everyone who is even remotely interested has either seen Avatar or heard about it, so I will dispense with the synopsis or any run down of the plot. I just have a few things to say about Avatar, Director James Cameron (self-proclaimed \\"King of the World\\"), the true worth of Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and the lovely and vivacious Zoë Saldana.<br /><br />-----------------<br />Selfridge: This is why we're here: because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo.<br />====================<br /><br />First, Avatar deserves every bit of its popularity and massive box office. It had the dazzling special effects, thrilling action, and steamy romance of the blockbuster, but it also had thought provoking concepts, a subversive political message, and compelling characters and story. When director James Cameron won the Oscar for Titanic, and Titanic won for best picture, I cringed--especially when he quoted Leonardo DiCaprio's line \\"I'm the King of the World!\\" It was adding insult to injury--rubbing salt in the wound. Not that Titanic was a bad film, it was just that it seemed like it swept all the awards except for acting and writing--as if those contributions no longer mattered. You could have a best film without the best acting or writing. I confess I felt a backlash to all the success it garnered, and I wanted it to lose. I don't care for Celine Dion, either, though I do admit that she has monumental pipes and can really belt out a tune. Perhaps I am a pretentious snob who looks down on anything that achieves such mass popularity (don't answer that)?<br /><br />But I do try to keep an open mind, and Avatar really won me over. I would have been happy to see it win either Best Film or Best Director. I didn't see The Hurt Locker, but if James Cameron and Avatar had to lose, that seems like the best alternate choice. First woman director, and Cameron's ex-girlfriend? James Cameron seemed very gracious about losing to her, and I find it very easy to forgive his hubris about Titanic now.<br /><br />------------<br />Dr. Grace Augustine: [to Jake, just before he connects to his Avatar] Just relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be too hard for you.<br />==================<br /><br />Avatar did something very difficult to do, and that is, it made you feel more connected to the blue people of Pandora then you did to your fellow earthlings. It was like a Western where you were rooting for the Native Americans to triumph over the cowboys. The tree huggers instead of the loggers. You rooted for the Marines--to lose! And it appealed to the masses. The Avatar concept no doubt helped, as when Jake Sully connected to his Avatar you saw the world through the eyes of the Na'vi.<br /><br />------------<br />Jake Sully: Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.<br />===============<br /><br />Sam Worthington was a really good choice to play Jake Sully. While channel surfing I briefly watched a segment on a sleazy papparazzi show like TMZ and the 'photo journalists' had nothing but good things to say about Sam. He was very down-to-earth, and humble about his recent good luck in starring in two major blockbusters: Clash of the Titans, and Avatar. Before his big break I saw him in an Australian film called Somersault that fans of the young Mr. Worthington might find interesting. In Avatar he brings a lot to the quest of Jake to become a \\"taronyu,\\" or hunter, even if it was done with mostly motion capture, CGI, and blue screen. He's no skxawng.<br /><br />------------------<br />Neytiri: To become \\"taronyu\\", hunter, you must choose your own Ikran and he must also choose you.<br />Jake Sully: When?<br />Neytiri: When you are ready.<br />========================<br /><br />Zoë Saldana, as the Na'vi woman Neytiri, also does a great job of acting that shows through all the special effects. She is a very intense actress, and also an extremely beautiful one. She is Nyota Uhura in the new Star Trek! Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi, and Stephen Lang as the quarrelsome Colonel Quaritch really made Avatar work.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is Avatar is a game changing milestone in the history of cinema. Great special effects and dazzling 3D, yet it didn't sacrifice characters or narrative on their unholy altar. I loved the scenes of Jake and the Na'vi warriors riding through the sky on their Ikrans. And Sam Worthington and Zoë Saldana are the cutest blue couple since Di Caprio and Winslet froze.<br /><br />---------<br />Neytiri: You are Omaticaya now.

B002FOQY2M|5.0|Fun Delivers!    Fun's Aim and Ignite CD is well...FUN!  Fans who miss The Format will not be disappointed by Nat Ruess's new musical effort.  Everything fun and fantastic about the Format is included in Fun's Aim and Ignite.  There isn't a bad song on the CD and the more I've listened to it the more I'm addicted.  It pains me if I have to take Aim and Ignite out of my CD player.  The lyrics and the music just make me want to get up and move!  Listening to their CD is almost as fun as seeing them play live.  It's just amazing!  By far it's my favorite CD of the year (I purchased it in January).   I love when you can put in a CD and just let it play and this is definitely one of those albums, there's no need to skip a song because they are all great songs.
0061922315|5.0|I loved this book!  The character development was fantastic.  No character was perfect; none was all good or all bad.  Each was flawed and complex, just like real people.  The themes of love and survival are universal.  This book will stay with me forever.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|I've bought Megadeth's \\"Endgame\\" album the day it came out but somehow I never got around reviewing it so here it is. After 2007's \\"United Abomination\\" which I really enjoyed, Mustaine released the new Megadeth album Endgame in September of 2009 to much acclaim from the metal community in general. Frontman Dave Mustaine received lots of praises for an album full of heavy riffs, great songs and the old-school Trash-Metal sound. Ok it may not sound THAT old school, but we can clearly see hints and glimpses of the greatness displayed on albums such as \\"Rust In Peace\\" and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\". I have to agree with all the positive that has been said about this album, I think it's the best Megadeth album since...a while let's just say. The songs have that energy to them that could be found on some the older albums but at the same time there's this newfound and very powerful energy displayed here on songs such as \\"1,320\\" that will please most Megadeth fans, and judging by the album's average rating here on Amazon I think I'm right.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd be blown away by Endgame at first but I was, I thought this would be a decent album but  after hearing \\"Headcrusher\\" and \\"1,320\\" my hopes were that the album was just as good. It turns out Endgame is a solid album from beginning to end and that there are more than a few good songs on it. I won't go through every song as other reviewers have already done a good job doing so but I will comment on a few. The album starts with the very strong instrumental \\"Dialectic Chaos\\", usually I'm not a particularly huge fan of instrumentals in general but you've got to love the energy and feel of this one! \\"This Day We Fight\\" is Dave being Dave, very pissed off, great guitar playing and excellent drums throughout the song much like the rest of the album, I have to say that the album starts very well. \\"1,320\\" is another terrific song, I love it when at 2:27 (approximately, more or less a second of difference) when it's silent and you only hear the drum kicking in making way for a fierce guitar performance by which I was impressed. I thought \\"Head Crusher\\" was a great song, sounds really aggressive and hardcore it represents the album really well. The title track \\"Endgame\\" is another strong song that I really enjoyed. I was surprised by \\"The Hardest part Of Letting Go...Sealed With A Kiss\\", it shows another side of Dave, a softer side, it starts out slow but gets heavy soon enough, I must say as well that it reminded me a little of \\"Promises\\" from the 2001 album \\"The World Needs A Hero\\".<br /><br />I don't think there is a whole lot of new on the album, not to complain, it's just a really good Megadeth album and I wouldn't want it any other way. Endgame sounds really aggressive which is great after all this is Megadeth not some cheesy pop band, it's honest and to the point, Endgame doesn't play any game I'll that you that. I think the main difference between Endgame and United Abominations is that the vocals on UA sounded more melodic to me and Endgame is more focused on riffs and the guitar work. I think both are very good albums however and this is just a point I'm trying to make. As for comparisons with Metallica's album \\"Death Magnetic\\" which came out a year before Endgame in 2008, I'm not even going to touch that subject because others have done so already and I don't want to risk upsetting anyone with my personal thoughts as I don't feel it's worth the trouble.<br /><br />Endgame ends up being one of the strongest Megadeth albums in recent years and in their entire catalog of music, but that's just my opinion really. I must give credit to Mustaine and the talented musicians for their amazing performance. I you're a fan of the band be sure to check this one out if you have not done so you are missing on something great! It's hard to say if this one is the last Megadeth album as Dave himself is unsure about it, all I know is that longtime bassist David Ellefson who's been with the band from its beginning back in 1983 until his departure in 2002 is now back in the band and another album is certainly not out of question just yet. In the meantime enjoy Endgame and keep rocking!ack in 1983 until his departure in 2002 is now back in the band and another album is certainly not out of question just yet.

B0026PA05M|5.0|Got the CD at the show on Wednesday night.  I figured I was going to get it anyway, I'll get it at the show and get it signed.  Anyway, back to the review.  I love the album.  I have to say I was very impressed with the show.  They are not a studio band(meaning they don't sound good live).  They were awesome.  Soo much energy on stage.  If there is anyone thinking about getting this disc, do it.  You will not regret it.  As with other reviews, they remind me of Heart only heavier.  Lzzy is awesome on vocals, guitar and is super-hot.  The show was great.  You have to check it out, before they really get big(and see them then also) but this way you get really up close.  It has been only 2 days since the concert and I already can't wait until they come back around here for another show.  I'm for sure going.

B000KIE11Q|5.0|I know I got this watch back when I was in Japan in between 99-01 can't remember what year.  I've had it for while until doing some work the band broke when I left Japan and moved to Hawaii.  Since then it has been packed away and I just found it today and was coming online to find a swatch shop in my area and found this on Amazon.  Just wanted to say this Watch is well worth it.  I used to get compliments all the time.  People couldn't  believe it was a Swatch when I showed them it up close.  Oh well time for me to go rock it again!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|First the problems:  Stripped DVD - the movie that was ALL there was.  Not one single extra.  There was no reason for a menu.  The movie and whether you wanted it subtitled or not.  That was IT. I had pre-ordered this DVD and therefore had no idea it wasn't going to have anything on it at all other than the movie, and that is why I am displease extras was still pending - and for that reason, the fifth star is lacking.  I will return this and re-purchase it when the release with the extra 40 minutes comes out; an entire sub-plot was cut to make the movie shorter and in my experience, anything cut from a James Cameron movie should not be cut - look at The Abyss; the part cut explained so much, without it, the alien's motivation didn't make sense, there was no reason without that missing few minutes.<br /><br />The fifth star will appear when I obtain the release with more than just the movie - and I had no advance warning that this was just the movie - the movie is 5+ stars, the packaging of it, without the omitted material, particularly the missing 20-40 minutes of the movie, will be 5 stars.<br /><br />And now the positives, which are self-evident, but I'll talk about them a bit:<br /><br />As far as content is concerned; It is a brilliant movie.  James Cameron's gift is to take the important messages and put them in a package that the masses who don't CARE about issues will go and see - and nonetheless without being aware that it is happening, will they, nil they (i.e. \\"willynilly\\") pick up the message.  Abyss has the same issues; Our inability to take care of the planet, our violence, how we are destroying the planet, our lack of evolution; how backward we are and insist on remaining, mired in violence, racism, ethnocentricity and stupidity -  unable to value the important things, unable to value our planet.<br /><br />Hiyao Miyazaki does the same thing and his work is all wonderful as well, message movies - dressed in stunning anime, drawing in audiences who otherwise wouldn't watch a \\"message movie.\\"  The same gift, and many of the same issues.<br /><br />Unfortunately very few want to hear a genuine analysis.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|It is really the plant life of Pandora that is especially interesting, far more so than the wooden marines trampling about over it. The electrified, phosphorescent flora and fauna are a real visual treat. As are the Na'vi themselves, elegant creatures. They prance and slide with glee, preforming feats of gymnastic wonderment with feline agility. The floating mountains they traverse are vast, impeccably-rendered. They hulk through the sky like rocky zeppelins, admirably vast and colorful. The human element of this story is, unfortunately, its undoing. The characters, from the cigarette-smoking boss lady to the paraplegic marine protagonist to the suit-and-tie antagonist hellbent on harvesting Pandora for all its natural deposits (a black element named absurdly \\"Unobtainium\\") are fairly stock and not especially interesting, especially when set against the gorgeous back-drops. The film, thankfully, diverts a lot of attention away from the dirty humans to showcase more fully the life of the jumping, arrow-slinging Na'vi in all their rich azure glory. There is a fairly convincing love story too. I won't dwell too much on the story, only revealing it as an allegory for the destruction of a natural environs at the hands of heartless humans. In this area, it succeeds, though ultimately it is pretty heavy-handed. (Tree of Life, eh?) Really though you aren't going to see it for the humans, you are seeing it for the creatures, the scenery, the effects. They are as amazing as you would expect. Sometimes I forgot, really and truly, that what I was seeing was made by some techies in a basement somewhere. It pops, fizzles, glows like the jungle mushrooms that illuminate when they are pawed by passing interlopers. Visually, a real treat. Story-wise, we've seen it before. Still you will be wowed, even if your expectations are sullied by the hype (my definitely were). This is a protracted trip, to be sure, but it is worth taking if you dig sci-fi.
B00151G08Y|5.0|To compare In Silico to Hold Your Colour is analogous to comparing apples to oranges.  As such, for those seeking more of Hold Your Colour, look elsewhere.  In Silico branches off and explores a new musical realm, with great success.  In many respects, this album offers richer melodies, lyrics, and energy than their first installment, thus evolving their already world renowned drum and bass formula.  I commend Pendulum for exploring other musical genres and am whole heartedly looking forward to their next album.  For any techno/rock/drum and bass/dance lover, I highly recommend this purchase.
0971407614|5.0|I just got the book today, and spent the day reading through it. I was hesitant to order it as I've never heard of Mark Lauren, even though he spent a decade training SpecOps troops. I thought this book would just give me a few extra exercises to complement my gym regimen, but as it turns out, it looks like it may replace it totally. I had no idea there were so many bodyweight exercises I could do for literally every part of my body. The exercises are very clearly explained and demonstrated, and appear to be adequate for just about any fitness level. The book also includes phenomenal chapters on nutrition, motivation, intensity, and other things, making this a one-stop deal. I'm going to be saving some serious money (not to mention time!) when I cancel my gym membership, for good.
B001HN694K|4.0|I've never actually read the books, or seen the cartoon, so I couldn't compare this. To me, it's just another typical gothic Tim Burton movie. Of course, no Tim Burton movie can be complete without Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Elfman music. This was like 'The Wizard of Oz' tripping on acid. 19-year-old Alice is forced to marry, so she runs away and falls down a rabbit hole, into Wonderland. She must team up with the Mad Hatter and try to stop the evil Red Queen. I'd probably recommend ALICE IN WONDERLAND!!!

B001GCUO5M|3.0|I thought was movie was alright. I didn't love it, yet I didn't hate it. One thing I loved was that it took place during the 1950's, because that's my favorite era. I also loved all the gothic dream sequences, and the look of the film. It gets a little confusing toward the end. DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and Ruffalo plays his partner named Chuck Aule. They are investigating the disappearance of a woman named Rachel Solando at an asylum for the criminally insane. Due to bad weather, Teddy and Chuck are stuck on the island, and must deal with the crazy inmates. and Teddy is forced to face his demons. I'd probably recommend SHUTTER ISLAND!!!
0345495004|4.0|Three-and-a-half stars<br /><br />Nancy Horan deserves much recognition for rescuing Mamah Cheney from the shadows of history. A multi-lingual scholar, feminist, and translator, Mamah bowed to social convention, marrying late and choosing a mild-mannered man. Living a privileged life in Oak Park, Illinois, she raised three children (two of her own and one of her dead sister's orphans) and lived in a harmonious household with her surviving sister. Everything was serene until she fell passionately in love with the architect Frank Lloyd Wright after her husband hired him to design their new home.<br /><br />Feeling that she had buried her true self in marriage, Mamah longed to live. And so she not only embarked on an affair with Wright, but abandoned her adoring husband, her children, and her sister, and ran away to Europe with Wright.<br /><br />I admired the fact that this is such a smart novel. Horan presents Mamah as an intellectual, a woman yearning to be her own woman, who first finds herself in middle age. This is no cheap bodice ripper.<br /><br />At times I despaired of what appeared to be Mamah's foolish choices. There were two things in the book that didn't quite work for me. I never really understood what she saw in Frank Lloyd Wright. The book is called \\"Loving Frank,\\" and yet I never found myself loving him in the least. I admire Horan's warts-and-all honesty about the man, and yet I never fathomed Mamah's passion for him and why she would make such a huge sacrifice for him, turning herself into an outcast and estranging herself from her own children. The husband she left behind seemed infinitely kinder than the brutally selfish Lloyd Wright.<br /><br />The other thing that didn't quite work for me was the ending. Obviously the author is bound to the facts and can't change history just to please the reader. But the end felt so abrupt, like a Quentin Taratino ending spliced on to a Merchant Ivory film. To use one of Lloyd Wright's own terms, the ending just didn't feel organic to the rest of the narrative. Perhaps the use of foreshadowing might have set this up better.<br /><br />However, the book is certainly worth reading. You'll learn a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright and early 20th century feminism.<br /><br />Mary Sharratt, author of Daughters of the Witching Hill, [...]the narrative.

With long epics, there tends to be 45 minute lull here and there, not here! Photography was well done, accuracy on point and gave both Northern and Southern sides glimpses into their humanity, ideology and military tactics.  Loved it.

But Miss Whiterspoon didn't seem to feel quite comfortable with her decisive role. She looks overacted and her required dramatic punch is absent all the way through.<br /><br />This is the only flaw of the film, and that's why I can't give this movie the five stars.
0385523386|5.0|Kerman's account of life inside a federal prison is very accurate and without a lot of hype. I've spent the last five years working as an educator in correctional institutions, and yes, I worked in a minimum security federal prison. We had every type of inmate you could imagine. Kerman is not an exception. If you think that privilege and education will make you immune to crime, think again! I am sorry that some of the reviewers have decided to criticize this book based on Kerman's background, lifestyle and education. Take the book for what it is... a realistic look into federal incarceration. Hopefully, this is as close as you will ever get to the inside of a prison.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|When I first saw Let The Right One In... I didn't know exactly what to think about the film. I new that it would take me sometime to get it to sync in. There was something about the movie that kind of left me unsettled. I'm sure some other folks were just as confused when they finished watching this film as well.<br /><br />The movie itself is pretty good for what it is. Low budget so don't expect any amazing special effects. The characters are pretty strange that includes Oskar who for some reason gets these ridiculous \\"orgasmic\\" close ups. Meaning he seems to be making these \\"ecstasy\\" expressions on his face at random times in the film (one when he's being whipped by bullies) just really strange I never got the joke if there was one.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good for what the film is. Although with the odd closeups I thought they'd pick a cuter girl to play Eli because her facial expressions where on par with Oskars.<br /><br />The story is where it gets complicated. I watched this on the Amazon English dub version. So I guess that's as good as it gets than reading subtitles. I'm not going to knock the film down because of that though. I watch plenty of subbed anime and I admit those old dubbed kung-fu films so bad dubbing doesn't bother me all that much. The story is based around a wimp named Oskar that meets a \\"girl\\" who is really some sort of vampire like being that survives off blood. She has some oddities about her that Oskar picks up on but over looks because he has no friends and anyone that notices him is someone worth forming a relationship with.<br /><br />The Girl Eli befriends him eventually after sharing a few moments together on a couple nights in the courtyard. She starts giving Oskar advice and he takes it to deal with his current \\"bully\\" problems. This part is especially funny as the dub features some of the bullies with female voices. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be girls or boys as they look like boys even at this point.<br /><br />Note: next 2 paragraph have a minor spoiler...<br /><br />The two start a relationship as friends and Oskar being a naive adolescent boy begins to fall for Eli as she is the closest thing he will get to a woman. Throughout the movie Eli keeps saying that she's not a girl...even though apparently she does appear to be one. Then in one scene she even sleeps naked with him and tells Oskar again she is not a girl. This is what was very confusing as you would think Oskar would ask more about that but he never does. So your lead to think that Eli is just referring to the fact that she's a vampire and not a human and no longer considers herself a girl.<br /><br />WRONG! I actually had to research the film and found out that it was based off of a book (like 90% of movies are). In the book it's noted that Eli or Elias is actually a \\"BOY\\" who has lost his genitalia through some ritual or whatever have you (yeah random as hell). So he has been living the past 200 years or so of his life as a little girl.<br /><br />This is the part that turns me off about the plot itself... mind you not the movie as it's good... just the plot. Elias is a 200 year old Man that looks like a 12year old girl, and basically is seducing a 12 year old boy whom he went so far as to sleep naked along side, and even passionately kiss at some point in the movie.<br /><br />This part about the film is what made it not settle right with me. To think that some 200 year old vampire is seducing young boys for his own personal interest is pretty disgusting. The film is great because it really does beat around the bush (literally) and you kind of never get it until you research on your own. Once you do it's an entirely different movie. The real horror is knowing that Elias is preying on young Oskar's emotions. I'm sure it's not the first time Eli has done this but it's what he does to survive. There's a few moments in the film where we see Eli as he truly is \\"an older man\\" but it's never made clear.<br /><br/>The thing about the movie that is the strangest is that you don't know if Eli is in love with Oskar or if he/she is just using him to suit their desires. That is never made clear but what is made clear is Oskars affection for Eli.<br /><br />Overall it's a 4/5 movie worth watching and checking out. The story however with me will remain to be a bit disturbing once you find out the secrets on your own nonetheless.w if Eli is in love with Oskar or if he/she is just using him to suit their desires.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|James Cameron's best picture-nominated sci-fi epic 'Avatar' has finally hit Blu-Ray, and it has brought quite a lot of controversy with it.  But we'll get to that in a minute.    The film itself needs no introduction.  The $2.7 billion it has grossed worldwide speaks to the fact that most people have probably watched the movie already.  Suffice to say it won't win any awards for story or originality, but James Cameron has created one of the deepest worlds ever put to film.  'Avatar' really feels like an experience rather than a run-of-the-mill movie, and I'll argue that it's an experience everybody should have.    On Blu-Ray, 'Avatar' is utterly gorgeous.  'Star Trek' is widely considered the best Blu-Ray on the market today, but if we're going strictly off of the technical aspects, 'Avatar' at least gives 'Trek' some heavy competition for the top spot.  The colors of Pandora are just as vibrant as in the movie theater, perhaps even more beautiful because the brightness isn't lessened by a 3D presentation.  And I've watched the movie with both a surround sound setup and basic built-in TV speakers, and it sounds amazing on both.    But there is a major catch.  Actually, there are two.  Consider them both before dropping the cash for 'Avatar.'    1. Bare-bones doesn't even begin to describe this Blu-Ray.        You're literally paying for the movie (in both HD and SD), some studio logos and a basic menu.  No special features, no trailers, not even cast and director profiles.  This is strictly 'Avatar.'     James Cameron has been quite open about the fact that there will be another edition of 'Avatar' released in November, with five or six minutes of additional footage.  It will also no doubt contain a plethora of special features, which are sure to be very interesting considering how Cameron actually made this movie.  If any of that sounds interesting to you, then pass on this one and wait until November.    2. This isn't in 3D.      I'm extremely critical of the useof 3D in movies.  It limits filmmakers and drives up ticket prices.  But, there's no denying that seeing 'Avatar' in 3D was a wonderful experience.  It's the best 3D we'll see, perhaps until Cameron makes another movie.  He made 'Avatar' with 3D in mind, and it shows in the film's theatrical presentation.  If you loved the 3D in 'Avatar,' just remember that it won't be the same on a small screen in 2D.  And yes, it will eventually see a 3D home video release, but you'll need the technology to support it.      That said, the Blu-Ray release is beautiful, and it actually surprised me how much I didn't miss the 3D.  Pandora is vibrant and immersing enough already, and although you'll notice the difference, this release of 'Avatar' proves just how unnecessary 3D is for the experience.    It would be very easy to criticize 'Avatar' for its inevitable double-dip release, but Cameron hasn't exactly hidden the fact that we'll be able to buy it again.  Normally I'd cry foul at an obvious cash cow like this, but this isn't secret or underhanded.  Anybody who knows the nature of film studios and their DVD releases will know to at least Google these things before dropping $19.99 on a single Blu-Ray.  Anybody who doesn't know to do so should get in the habit of researching their home video purchases, because it's important to make sure you're getting what you want.    In closing, buy this version if you don't care about special features or extra footage.  It features a beautiful transfer that will not disappoint.  But that's all.  If you want more, then wait for November.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book! It is not often that I am sad when I finish a book because I will miss the characters, but that's how I felt when I finished this novel. I had a hard time putting it down to accomplish anything at home, but it was worth it! This author takes a look at slavery from a vantage point I had not previously considered: an indebted white slave. As such, her position is similar to that of the black slaves and yet she does not quite fit in with them, and she certainly does not fit in with the white plantation owners. I am recommending this book to everyone!

0785134352|3.0|I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick Ass]] I decided to give the graphic novel a try. First of all, it's a fun, very quick read, because it's heavy on the \\"graphic\\" and light on the \\"novel\\". Lot's of well-drawn, \\"graphic\\", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere as well as other bodily fluids.<br /><br />The story is very well written and flows superbly. I got through the entire book in just about an hour. The story introduces us to a high school kid whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying \\"you guessed it\\" now.) He puts on a costume and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.<br /><br />The story is pretty believable up until he starts to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. Then when 10 year old HitGirl shows up and exhibits superhuman power (for a 10 year old anyway) and resolve, the story gets a tad--wait, no--a lot unbelievable.<br /><br />But overall I enjoyed the ride and I'm now truly looking forward to seeing the film adaptation when it comes out on Blu Ray. So would I recommend the book? Sure. Absolutely. Especially if you've not seen the movie.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|If you have an LG BluRay/HD-DVD rom in your computer...  --The firmware updates you download may still not allow you to watch this movie. I updated my player (that's less than 6 months old) and it still won't play Avatar. I read further about this in reviews on the net. Apparently, the firmware updates for LG haven't caught up with the DRM software in these types of BluRay discs, so beware.    --And Amazon: the next time you presell a BluRay/DVD - highly touted or not - make sure it's not going to screw over your customers. I kept my DVD version (since, luckily, it still worked), but I gave my BluRay version to a friend who was able to update his PS3 so he could watch it, just so I wouldn't have the hassle of returning it. It's very aggravating for your customers to wait for a pre-bought item and then have to go through the trouble of returning it because they weren't warned about a format change beforehand. If you didn't know either, you need to start talking to your vendors BEFORE you post a sale of the item.    --Hey Hollywood: When you sit around pulling your hair out over loss of profits because people pirate movies, THIS IS WHY THEY DO IT, DUMMIES!

386521584X|5.0|Somethings just go together. Peanutbutter and jelly. Knotty pine paneling in a fishing-lake bar. Bouffants on R&B singers. And Jack Kerouac's introduction to 83 stark b/w photos (\\"lugubrious\\" Jack might say) shot by Robert Frank in 1955 / 1956 as he traveled the lower 48, funded by a Guggenheim Foundation grant. The book: The Americans is a terrific arty, documentary commentary on mid-20th-century America.<br /><br />I would have said the book is worth having for the Kerouac introduction alone--because it is so good....so....so Kerouac--until I reverently turned the pages, which is what one should do when viewing a collection of photos, drawings, or art and was delighted to remain in the desperate, yearnful, plain-is-the-new-god mood that Kerouac had expertly created in his introduction. Frank's photos capture the everyday in all of its beauty. Many of the photos look like rejects from the envelope of prints eagerly picked up from the 1950's or 1960's photo lab where you have spinster Aunt Millie asking why did you waste film on this--they're not even looking at the camera, or it's a bunch of people at a funeral, or it's a road at night.<br /><br />Get this book.

0393072231|5.0|Look at the reviews-  Hate it or love it...        but I have a feeling that even those who say they hated it were entertained.  Long story short, I believe Michael Lewis is a brilliant writer, even if his political biases are overly exposed at times, and he flip flops on the utility of derivatives (ps - just because derivates were misused in an astounding way exacerbating the financial crisis, that does not mean that they cant serve a valuable role in efficiently redistributing risk in our economy).  Read the book, learn the untold story of those who observed what was going on.  It may not cover every base, or even the most important bases from a financial volume standpoint, but there is still a ton to be learned.  The overall message, in my opinion, was dead on.  Incentives on Wall Street were incredibly misaligned, and we all saw the result.  Those responsible for the mess walked away with millions, sometimes billions.  However, Lewis's biases revealed - there is certainly no mention of Clinton's push to make housing a right, which helped pave the way for the problem on the ground.  How are mortgage originators and banks to compete with entities like Fanny, implicitly and inappropriately backed by the government?  (and inappropriately mandated to make affordable affordable to all).  They found a way- and I would be interested in a book from this perspective.  Either way, I digress...    This is an excellent and accurate book that shares stories that anyone interested in American banking, or the cause of the great recession, should read.
0385504225|1.0|I really liked Brown until I read this book. I've read all of his books and I can tell how he went from being an excellent thriller writer to just write against christianity and any other form of religious belief. From his real enjoyable masterpiece \\"Angel & Demons\\" to his real nonsense fairytale of a \\"Lost Symbol\\". The use of science, bible references and more just don't make any sense. It was hard to start the book and even worse to keep on. The way he trick the reader into not discovering who's the bad guy is just insulting. I was expecting more from him but I feel like he lost his way. He used every chance he had to confuse more than to illustrate.    Even if you like his other books you really need to think if you want to loose your time reading something that doesn't really makes sense.    Suggestion: Read \\"Angel's and Demons\\" and \\"DaVinci Code\\" instead of this one.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Absolutely Riveting!  By far, the best film of 2009.      Tarrantino's mastery went far beyond the violence, and confirmed once again he is a writer director with extraordinary skill.  The restraint Tarrantino exercised was a surprise and only made this film better.  Christoph Waltz (who won every award imaginable for this part) stole the film with his mesmerizing performance. Tarrantino used actors from Germany and French, which gave a gravity and believability to the film. Simply superb casting and fine, fine acting all the way around.  The only challenge I found with the film was reading the subtitles.  They were not always placed against a dark background making it difficult to read and went by far to quickly.
B0018BF1J0|5.0|The Original Album Sets are amazing.  If you don't mind paper sleeves that remind you of the original albums (but CD size of course), then what you end up getting is some amazing classic music.  I think I average $4 an album.  If you want to revisit or expose yourself to some amazing music that remains relevant today (how fresh does Coney Island Baby sound)...highly reccomended.
0446567337|1.0|I was pretty disappointed in this book, and am shocked they made it into a movie. The plot is so thin it has no major crisis, reads like a high schoolers diary, and really doesn't provide the spark that Nicholas Sparks' other books provided.<br /><br />Of the ones he's written, the \\"Last Song\\" had me crying the last two and a half chapters. In this book, I kept reading because I was confident it 'had to pick up' at some point in the middle, and was very disappointed that it continued to be boring all the way through.<br /><br />The beginning had an excellent 'hook' and I was expecting it to come full circle and end happily ever after. It didn't, I hated the boring ending, the story really didn't have a apex, and Nicholas Sparks should have been ashamed to even let this book out of his house for printing. I'm disappointed in myself that I paid full price for this paperback book fully expecting to get my money's worth based on what I know of his other books and wonderful plots.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this book or the movie. It sucked!<br /><br />(Sorry Nicholas - you can do better - I've seen it and read it!)
1400064627|4.0|My Summary: A very character-driven book, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe  follows the story of the people who live in Whistle Stop Alabama from the late 1920s all the way through to Birmingham in the 1980s. The story is told in second and third person, going back and forth between conservations between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgood.<br /><br />Themes: Racism and race relations before the civil rights movement and after; vague GLBT themes; small town life<br /><br />My Thoughts: I loved it! This book is a new favorite of mine, which took me by surprise.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading about the various lives in Whistle Stop, Alabama and the stories that were threaded throughout the novel. I also felt that this was well-accomplished and neatly done by Fannie Flagg, though there are many others who disagree (see reviews on any of the networking sites listed above).<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie (and I hadn't, would you believe it?), please be aware that this book jumps around in time quite a bit, from the twenties to the thirties, to the eighties to the forties to the twenties and back again, over and over. Sometimes story lines drop off entirely only to be picked up again much later in the book. This worked for me, but I can see how others might have struggled with this.<br /><br />I hear the movie is better than the book -- it's going to have to work hard to do that for me when I get a chance to see it!

B000AY3KN0|5.0|King Kong is Merian Cooper's story about a giant ape and the beauty who ultimately brings him crashing to earth.  But you would have to search pretty far afield to find a better supporting cast than the variety of Mesozoic nasties King does battle with on Skull Island.  Cooper's initial take on the film was to feature a man in a gorilla suit and Komodo dragon lizards as the dinosaurs.  However, after seeing footage from an unfinished epic by Willis O'Brien, the dean of dinosaurs, Cooper hired O'Brien to bring his ape and other animals to life, and O'Brien delivered.    The story, which at one point in pre-production went under the title The Beast, tells the tale of a film crew shooting on location on the mysterious Skull Island.  The filmmakers discover a wall constructed by the natives to protect them from something mysterious that lives on the other side of the island; something called Kong.  During the night, actress Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) is kidnapped by the natives and tied to a sacrificial altar; the better to become the bride of Kong.  To everybody's surprise and horror, a giant ape arrives and takes the girl.  The crew, headed by Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) and John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), gives chase and soon encounter terrifying dinosaurs who succeed in killing most of the rescuers.  Ann is finally rescued and Kong is captured and taken to New York, where he escapes and destroys much of the city before meeting his fate atop the Empire State Building.    Much of O'Brien's animation work was done by matching live action footage with minatures and models, but he also utilized specially constructed tabletop sets and a variation of the then-accepted form of rear-screen projection.  It was arduous work, but the results are some of the most memorable dinosaur scenes in movie magic history, including Kong's fight to the death with a Tyrannosaurus Rex, an Apatosaurus rising out of the water and capsizing a raft, and Kong fighting a Pteranodon as it tries to carryAnn away (physically impossible, but extremely entertaining and well-animated).    I could go on and on about this truly classic film, but I won't.  Just do yourself an enormous favor and buy it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|There's little I can add to the excellent reviews posted before mine. I however have to admit that I considered this to be just another football flick and the football part is only tangential to the real story here. I haven't underestimated a film to such a degree in a long,long time, and it has more to do with this film's perfection than anything I have to offer as an opinion. The acting is great and as I write this after this year's Oscars I can say that Sandra Bullock fully deserved her award. It's a story of deliverance but not of the torturous,grizzly type  but rather of the gentle,kind, loving one where a teen's life changes with the help,understanding and unwavering support of his newly found family.  One thing every one that haven't seen it yet should remember is to stay and keep watching as the final credits roll down. There are number of actual pictures and even some footage of the actual Mike Oher and his family. It's worth the time.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|I really want to give this book 5 stars but I can't. The ending was so good but the first 60% was very long and tedious at most times. There were parts where you would be totally sucked into the story and then it would revert back to some slowness. Some of this is caused by the way this book is structured. Every chapter was a different year and from a different character's life at the time. So back and forth all the time. It was a little hard to keep up with all the characters at first but then you get the hang of it. Once this book got to 60% I couldn't put it down becuase the plot just swept you right up. Tragic story with a satisfying ending. I would recommend this with the warning that the first half is slow but it pays off big in the end. I will probably read Mrs. Morton's next book when it comes out in the Fall.
B001C2CU3A|5.0|I have a very good friend. He is an intellectual and an alcoholic. My dad was an alcoholic but not an intellectual. I drink myself and have had a good many in depth discussions with many a drunken barroom philosopher.<br /><br />My old pal, the intellectual, and I have spent numerous evenings discussing \\"life, love, the here-and-now and the forever after\\" over a jug of wine or scotch and a big plate of ham and cheese. Oftentimes my old buddy would turn on the tape recorder and record our meanderings. In the days afterward, he would listen to them over and over - even without a bottle of scotch by his side.<br /><br />One day I asked him why in the name of heaven he was recording all our drunken babbling. He said, \\"Some day I am going to put it all together and publish it as a Kurt Vonnegut novel.\\"<br /><br />Reading Slaughter-house Five has been my first experience with Kurt Vonnegut and I must say my old buddy has a pretty good idea.<br /><br />Kurt admits to being a drinker in this book and calling friends on the phone late in the evening ... and babbling. I know nothing more about Kurt and his life than what I have read in this one short volume. But this book does remind me of many a bar-stool conversation that I have had in my lifetime.<br /><br />I sit down at my stool and the fellow next to me, Kurt Vonnegut, begins to expound. He smiles, laughs often and sucks me into his monologue. He begins light and airy but with a humorous gravity. A few minutes into his spontaneous dissertation, he lowers his head to the bar and goes to sleep.<br /><br />Ten minutes later, the bartender slaps his hand on the bar and Kurt wakes up. He immediately starts talking about his days as a prisoner of war in World War II. He talks for about five minutes and then his head collapses to the bar once again. When he awakes this time he has just been kidnapped by Martians. He talks about this experience for a moment or two but then slips off into the fog once again.<br /><br />Life goes on ... \\"and so it goes\\" until Kurt pops up again. This time he talks of his pal who didn't make it back from the war and somehow we slip into his wife and her current cancer treatments and then we go back to the slaughter-house where he and a few buddies were being held as prisoners during the bombing in Dresden, Germany in World War II.<br /><br />The next time he wakes up we are into his oldest son and the fist fight they had when the boy turned 22 and then we are off and into his third wife and her bouts with depression.<br /><br />Kurt wanders in and out of consciousness. He makes you laugh, he chocks you up and he changes the topic as soon as he thinks he could be losing you. His story has no beginning, middle or end. It is a feel-as-you-go type thing - spontaneous, quick-witted, personal, witty and emotional. And, like Mark Twain, he challenges the reader to find a plot. But yet you find yourself very entertained. And when you get up from your stool, you toss a few bucks onto the bar and tell the bartender to give Kurt a drink or two on you ... when he wakes up again. \\"You know,\\" you comment to the bartender before leaving, \\"every barroom needs a guy like this. You got to keep this guy around.\\" The bartender laughs.<br /><br />Kurt admits that he did not want to write about this subject and for much of the book he doesn't. It reads as if he wrote it with a bottle of scotch or bourbon by his typewriter. As the bottle empties the monologue becomes more intense, more emotional and more dramatic.<br /><br />The trick here is like with Mark Twain himself. Mark Twain was a \\"rambler\\" but he was also a serious writer. His rambling were planned and thought out and agonized over. I believe Kurt is of the same character.<br /><br />Contrary to intended appearances, he's not babbling and he is not drunk. He is writing, composing, creating. He is capturing his reader with variety and inventiveness. He has created a character of himself. He is definitely a \\"different\\" typewriter. He has a style and a personality and it shows. He's good.<br /><br />Cheers Kurt. The stool next to me is always open.<br /><br />I will be reading more of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. I have a big stack of his books out in my poor man's library in a shed in my backyard. Poor Kurt has been sitting out there by himself for a number of years. I will have to join him more often in my future; I'll bring a bottle of something special along.<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"A Summer with Charlie\\" Salisbury Beach, Lawrence YMCAys open.

B00004RYC8|5.0|among the films arnold schwarzenegger has made over the years. this is one of my favorites because he is a killing machine from the future and the epitome of the stone-faced bad guy.when originally released in 1984 this film was labeled science  fiction. i think of this film as goth-sci-fi horror, a film label which (i believe)did not exist in the 1980's (well i don't think it did). though i would like to own this film, i've done my research and there is supposed to be a longer more uncut version of it (more violence). until then i may just wait for the said uncut edition  to be released her in the us.

031606792X|5.0|I think this novel is the best of the series. Many people will fall in love with the fantasy world that includes vampires and werewolves. However, underneath that exterior a reader can also find life lessons. This story is told in 3 parts, and in each part the nararrator exhibits a sense of leadership. For example, in the first section Bella has to deal with personal problems. She and Edward go to Carlisle for help. He remains calm and collected in a time where almost anyone else would panic. He is the greatest example of a leader; people are drawn to his demeanor and they want him to be who they follow. He truly is an admirable and underrated character in the novel. In the second section, Jacob is speaking from his perspective. He and his wolf pack members are incredibly unique. They operate as a machine under the direction of one person- their pack leader Sam. He has 100% of every member's trust, and they rely on him to make their decisions for them. His followers give him the utmost respect, and in return he respects them. This is an extremely important quality in a leader; in order to gain the faith of your followers you must treat them fairly and make them want to trust you. In the third part of the novel, Bella speaks again from her perspective. I will not reveal the excitement that takes place in this section, however let it be known that Bella discovers her inner leader that I believe every one of us has. She is a remarkable character and the obstacles she overcomes are unforgettable.

B0033B5XCS|5.0|Because of the release of the new version of \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" that hit theatres on April 30th, 2010, New Line Home Video has released all the \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" films in one complete boxset at a relatively low price. Here you get all 8 films, uncut, in widescreen format to enjoy for posterity. I have to admit that I have always been a horror movie buff, but the \\"Nightmare\\" series of films left me disappointed after viewing the sequels upon their original release. I love the first \\"Freddy\\" film; its filled with an intelligent story and an amazing and scary villin who terrorizes teenagers in their sleep. The sequences are directed in masterful fashion and the movie is horrorfying. Unfortunately, the studio released seven other sequels that were nowhere near as freightening as the original. This marks a time that a studio made sequels for financial purposes, ignoring the cardinal rule of having a good script with original and intelligent movie making. Still, if your a \\"Nightmare\\" fan or a fan of horror films this is a nice package to buy to have in your home DVD collection. The price is wonderful as well.<br /> There are also not many bonuses accompanying the films themselves, but a few of the films do have commentary by some of the actors and directors.

B0033AX26I|5.0|The Chieftains being one of my favorite groups was the inspiration for our own Irish Latin Fusion project, La Unica Irish Band and single [[ASIN:B003JH8SFA Caminante De Mis Amores]], another blend of Irish and Latin music.  The solid beats of the Chieftain bodhran reminded us of some nice Conga rhythms used throughout Latin jazz and salsa.<br /><br />We were quite pleased to hear the Chieftains released a mix of Irish and Mexican music, and San Patricio doesn't disappoint!  As usual, the Chieftains find a way to blend seemingly contrasting styles and even impressively incorporate bagpipes and drums into their songs.  Probably the best mix is their treatment of Sonny's Mazurka (La Iguana).  Well done!

B001ILHY1I|1.0|Death Race consists of painful and unpleasant sensations, a nauseous movie for kids with a mental age of between - 8 and 12 years, obsessed with stupid video games like Twisted Death Metal and Road Smash.  Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense \\"fun.\\"<br /><br />Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story.  Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).<br /><br />Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.<br /><br />I was incredibly let down by this film.  This is a phenomenally unintelligent movie.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Listening to Resistance for about the 30th time right now. I totally love it, all of it! I scored tickets to their Resistance concert in San Diego in September and can't wait.  My sister is coming down from Oregon to go with me and I'm heartened to learn here that we won't be the only old-er individuals attending!    As for the album, my god, it just builds and builds until it reaches the exquisite Exogenesis cuts! And what makes Exogenesis so stunning is everything that precedes it.  This album was brilliantly crafted and I think Muse is one of the most talented groups around.

B00000I3JO|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time. Paul Buchanen has a singular voice and the songs have an ethereal moody quality while remaining honest. It's really too bad the Blue Nile doesn't make more albums. I heard Buchanen say in an interview that they make an album when they feel like it, and that they're not driven by trying to make as much money as possible or becoming celebrities. Very different band with an alternative view of many things. Great great album.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I do not get or want to pay extra bucks to get HBO where I live in Montreal.  But I did see part of one episode (can't even tell you which one) while vacationning in Cuba of all places...yes Varadero Cuba and get this they also had CNN!  Anyway...I had high expectations and like many of you was hoping for this series to be a second BOB, well BOB it is not.  Perhaps we got attached to the men of Easy Company so much that our expectations were too high but I found that the actors in Pacific were just that, actors. In BOB they were soldiers.  I did not see the sex scene and can not \\"appreciate\\" it's pertinence but it is part of life and sometimes part of a soldier's experience (yes even in WWII).  What I find odd is that it seems perfectly acceptable to some to show graphic violence and totaly revolting to show graphic sex.  People often die from violence, rarely from sex.

Thank God Mamah found her passion in time to claim her independence from the man she loved, Frank Lloyd Wright. All he wanted was to possess her. That old adage of letting the bird fly free and he will return to you is so true. Frank found that out, soon enough to love her until her untimely death. It looks like I really liked the book and to tell the truth, it was hard to put it down. I cried at the end.
B000XA5K48|4.0|To say that this film is over the top at being over the top, would be as intellectually insightful as saying water is wet. There's not a single thing in this movie that can be taken seriously, despite the fact it's loaded with violence and adult themes, and therein lies the true charm of the spectacle.<br /><br />Clive Owens plays the mystery man known only as &#34;Smith.&#34; After he helps a women birth her child during a gunfight, he finds himself caught up in a web of outrageous political intrigue, with the baby's life, as well as his own, as the stakes.<br /><br />This is basically a parody send up of every gun-blazing, ass-kicking, tough guy action film you've ever even heard about. Owens character never misses a shot (or the chance to chomp on some carrots), in shootouts that are not just overly exaggerated, but completely impossible, in many cases. You have Paul Giamatti as the sleazy hit-man out to get him and the baby, with Monica Bellucci simply providing eye-candy, as the milk-giving whore helping Smith to save the child. There isn't a single moment that you can really take any of this seriously, but the filmmakers know this and don't just fail to apologize for it, but actually revel in it.<br /><br />The choreography in the gunfights is superb. If you could actually pull off some of the stunts shown here, I fully believe the real world would be as mindlessly violent as this film is. My favorite has to be the skydiving shootout, where physics and several universal laws of kinetic energy and gravity simply don't exist. This is to say nothing of the many machismo one-liners that are constantly thrown around throughout the film, which provide the perfect black humor to the massive amounts of killing going on. Of course, one can't forget the rocking soundtrack, complete with trashy metal sounds, from groups like Motley Crue and Motorhead, that only intensifies the sensation.<br /><br />Is &#34;Shoot 'Em Up&#34; sexist? Yep. Is it somewhat homophobic? You betcha. Is it overly violent? Oh, hell yes! The film is all of that, as well as not having a single redeeming value within the whole product. Yet, despite all of this, it is still a rip-roaring, testosterone-fueled, slam-banging, out-of-control good time, that will charm it's way into your heart and have you quoting lines from it for days afterwards! If you are someone who's easily offended, or has delicate sensibilities, then this movie is one you probably should avoid. For everyone else, just sit back and watch the mindless carnage unfold. This is truly a guy's movie, for guys who like movies. And it is probably the guiltiest pleasure experience I've had in some time.cha. Is it overly violent? Oh, hell yes!

B0004Z33EG|5.0|A lot of people would likely classify this film as an &#34;action movie.&#34; While there is certainly some great action sequences to be found here, it is really so much more than that. &#34;First Blood&#34; is something more than the typical shoot 'em up action epic, as it has the undertones of some very definite political themes and societal messages that most mere &#34;action movies&#34; never do.<br /><br />Aside from Rocky Balboa, John J. Rambo is without question the most iconic character in Sylvester Stallone's long career. And of the two, he is certainly the more emotionally complex. A man of deep loyalties and convictions, he is also easily able to shun aside the moralities of the supposed civilized world and, when provoked, become little more than a killing machine. It is this duality of a man who simply wants a quiet place for himself in the world, yet who is capable of committing some of the most outrageous acts of violence ever seen, that is what make the character so compelling.<br /><br />But it isn't simply Sly's performance as Rambo that gives the film such resonance. Equally adding the this potent dramatic brew are veteran actors Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. While Sly spends most of the film running through forests and slogging through tunnels, the interaction between Dennehy and Crenna's characters brilliantly encapsulate the clash of political views at the story's core.<br /><br />As noted the action scenes are very well done here. They almost make you believe that Rambo could single-handedly take down an entire town. They never go too far, or become too outlandish, with things. They keep it feeling just realistic enough to add the much needed tension for the inevitable showdown at the film's end. Adding to this is the stellar musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is just the perfect compliment to the story unfolding. It never distracts you from what's occurring on screen and, in fact, enhances the emotions of the situations even more. Just what any good score should do.<br /><br />What more can be said about this film, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The film would create a cultural icon that would embody the decade of the 80's, as well as inspire sequel films for over 20 years. But while those sequels would easily up the ante in terms of non-stop action, they would never attain the same level of emotional drama that this film does. &#34;First Blood&#34; was a film that asked a lot of hard questions about a war, and it's aftermath, that had no easy answers. And that, above all else, is what makes it more than merely &#34;another 80's action movie.&#34; It makes it a classic!t what any good score should do.<br /><br />What more can be said about this film, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before?

B002VPE1AW|2.0|I think when a screenwriter completely disregards the laws of physics, it's because he's lazy.  His imagination is just in cartoon land.  [SPOILER ALERT!]        Mountains can't float, people can't be 10 feet tall (their knees, ankles & feet would snap).  They can't be as dense and stronger than humans and fly on the backs of aerial creatures.  In fact giant creatures can't fly!  Look up pterodactyl.  Lame...Cartoon land.  Physics is physics.       The whole \\"Dances w/wolves\\" on another planet is so 1990/1890.  After two weeks of camping in the woods I can't wait for my hot shower.  I love my toilet, soap and hot water!  I like grocery and big box stores; my car, clothes, medicine, hospitals, fast food, the internet and phones to name just a few.  Anyone who wants to go live off the land should try it for a year.  It is hard, relentless, uncompromising work where one goof leaves you starving, injured or dead.  Demonizing the military/industrial complex is a cheap shot at a lot of hard working folk who are doing the right thing.  And if you want to live on a planet like Pandora (population about 10,000?)  6.99 billion of us have to go and the rest have to stop producing like rabbits.  The line is over there!       And seeing the kick-ass (Aliens), scary (Snow-White), gracious (Gorillas in the Mist), funny (Ghostbusters) Sigourney Weaver as a giant Smurf was ludicrous.  But for some reason, neither the laws of physics or the rules of Hollywood apply to James Cameron. This movie is for third graders.  I'm sure the 3-D effects were great, but I hated the whole thing.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|I had high hopes, like many, going into this film. As a fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to that &#34;blown out of my seat&#34; experience the other films of this saga have given me. Besides which, this is the film we've all been waiting for since the beginning, right? The future war! The resistance vs. Skynet! It couldn't possibly be bad, could it? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong!<br /><br />This film lacked anything in the way of atmosphere or suspense. The mood of the film was extremely flat from almost the start and never really came to life. On top of that, I feel too much time was spent on the machines and not enough on John Connor and the humans (whom you'd think we should be rooting for). Sam Worthington's character, of the man made into a machine, never gained any sympathy or interest from me. The fact they gave away the &#34;secret&#34; to his character in the trailers, certainly didn't help that, either. His character's actions are schizophrenic, at best, half the time making little sense, if any, and almost never ring true. A major flaw, to be sure, with how much time he gets on screen.<br /><br />Then you have Christian Bale, who plays John Connor as a &#34;Batman-lite&#34; affair. He uses the same kind of voice here, that he did in &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; and it just doesn't work. He portrays none of the charisma and leadership that we know the character is supposed to have. All the emotions we've felt for him in the past are all stripped away here, as he comes off like a whiny and self-absorbed jerk. Hardly one you'd want being the savior of the human race. None of the other resistance members get enough screen time to make any kind of impression on you, so you never develop any bond in what might happen to them. I don't know if the cast just didn't care about the film, or if the script just gave them nothing to work with, but there is no fire in any of the performances.<br /><br />And even if the script doesn't let the actors down, it has more than a few problems itself. They never really explain why Sam Worthington's character is the one chosen by Skynet. The story never gives you any feelings of dread or panic, despite tons of action on the screen. And while those action sequences are well shot and choreographed, they lack any real excitement. It never gets your pulse pounding. Plus there are tons of little things in the film, like Connor's wife being pregnant, which get no explanation or even a passing mention. I mean, what's the point in doing that, if it doesn't mean anything? And why is Skynet herding people into camps (ala the Nazis)? Shouldn't it simply be destroying all human life, to protect itself and win the war? It is another plot point that makes no sense, nor is given any reasoning for, in a script filled with them.<br /><br />Worst of all, and the one major flaw that ruins the whole film for me, is how, after Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, in one of the few decent performances in the film), it doesn't kill him immediately, but uses him as bait to lure John Connor into a rescue mission. This kind of thinking, in terms of revenge and greed, is an emotional human failing Skynet should not have. It is a machine. It should know the simple equation: &#34;Kill Kyle Reese, John Connor is no more!&#34; The only reason for it, is to provide the big end battle, where Connor faces the Terminator 101-model (with CGI used to show Arnold in his prime). It's all just a waste and doesn't deliver any thrills.<br /><br />Many folks blasted &#34;T3&#34; for some of the inconsistencies it had, but compared to this mess of a film, it was sheer cinematic brilliance! &#34;Terminator Salvation&#34; could truly be considered a franchise killer, on par with the fiasco that &#34;Batman and Robin&#34; was for the Batman one. Old school fans of this saga will not find this enjoyable, and any attempts to bring in new fans will be dashed at the overly-complicated back-story used to get them up to speed on this film. In short, this is a film that will appeal to few people, be they fans of these films or not. It is a complete waste of time, money and talent. And that is the purest definition of the term &#34;whipped up movie,&#34; which this effort most assuredly is, that I can think of!m up to speed on this film.

B00122HTT0|5.0|This might be Neil Young's best album.<br /><br />I suspect there are reasons it isn't often regarded as such; it was unavailable on CD until 2006, so it wasn't as widely known as the ones that caught the ears of the critics, or won the hearts of the public. And the songs from \\"On the Beach\\" that those of us without record players had heard--\\"Walk On\\" and \\"For The Turnstiles,\\" both on his Greatest-Hits collection, \\"Decade\\"--possibly ended up there because frequent producer David Briggs produced them, and not because they were the best songs on the album. (According to the excellent biography \\"Shakey,\\" a must-read for any fan of Neil's, Briggs was a bit of a control freak, and tended to be dismissive of songs he hadn't had a part in; he produced \\"Decade\\" but only the aforementioned two songs on \\"On The Beach.\\" And this--granted, I'm speculating--might be why other tracks didn't make the cut. And it's a shame, because there are at least three songs here that are better: \\"Revolution Blues\\" and \\"On the Beach\\" and \\"Ambulance Blues.\\")<br /><br />Of course, Neil simply has a pretty wide and varied discography; in a field of albums that are standouts by other artist's standards, it's easy for such a unique album to get left out. Few musicians have dabbled in a wider range of styles; generally speaking, he alternates between charging raging hard rock and whispery singer-songwriter stuff, but he's covered enough ground between and around these poles that it isn't a simple either/or equation. On \\"Rust Never Sleeps,\\" he drew a sharp line down the middle of his musical persona by dividing his album into acoustic and electric sides, making a closing bookend for a decade-plus of prime singer/songwriter rock by inverting the formula of Dylan's \\"Bringing it All Back Home.\\" If those albums are endpoints, though, \\"On the Beach\\" is one of the high points in between.<br /><br />On this, Neil did something much different than he'd later do on the black/white \\"Rust,\\" or on his various other excellent (but somewhat more monochromatic) albums; here he seemingly put more effort into integrating his various tendencies and painting with multiple hues. Unlike, say, the bleak and dark \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" there are loud and bright songs here (\\"Walk On\\"), and clean and harrowing ones (\\"On the Beach\\" and \\"Ambulance Blues.\\") The tunes are full and rich without the sick orange slickness of \\"Harvest,\\" and they're meaningful and deep without the sloppiness of \\"Tonight's the Night.\\" And people rightly laud the pithy insight that \\"It's better to burn out than it is to rust\\" on \\"Rust Never Sleeps,\\" but there's plenty of pith here, as well. \\"I'm deep inside myself, but I'll get out somehow,\\" he laments on \\"Motion Pictures,\\" for instance; although it is a whine, it's one I can always relate to. (The same goes for the title track's complaint that \\"Though my problems are meaningless, that don't make `em go away\\" and the closing track's observation that \\"It's easy to get buried in the past when you try to make a good thing last.\\") And lest I forget--is there a more awesome song than \\"Revolution Blues\\"? Neil's the one who dared to chronicle the dark side of the hippie dream, the drug deals gone bad and the friends ODing, and this song is the darkest of the dark, a prime piece of proto-grunge sung from the perspective of none other than Charles Manson. And yet it never sounds as fake or contrived as it could have been in the hands of a lesser writer; it's a shambling, shimmering piece of funky blues that stays with you long after you stop listening to it.<br /><br />On the surface, it seems like an aberration, this track--edgier and darker than almost anything else on this album. And yet there is something apropos about it, and something whole about \\"On The Beach\\" that makes it a landmark--one often overlooked, and half-buried in the sand, but a landmark all the same--for both the artist and the decade. For it speaks to where the artist and his country-of-residence found themselves in 1974--looking for a little head space, as if wandering amidst sand and surf until the sun and the waves could bleach and fade and bury and wash everything away, all the unfortunate banner headlines and the rusted pieces of the American Dream. \\"On the Beach\\" showed us Neil with a head full of bad memories, staring off into an emptiness that seemed infinite, but it was also a place to put his problems (and ours) in perspective, and to find a fresh start.r a little head space, as if wandering amidst sand and surf until the sun and the waves could bleach and fade and bury and wash everything away, all the unfortunate banner headlines and the rusted pieces of the American Dream. \\"On the Beach\\" showed us Neil with a head full of bad memories, staring off into an emptiness that seemed infinite, but it was also a place to put his problems (and ours) in perspective, and to find a fresh start.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|You always get a potential mixed bag when comics are adapted to the silver screen. Not everything done in a comic can translate to the screen and vice versa. And creative liberties are almost always used in excess, when compared to the actual source material. Fortunately, such is not the case for &#34;Whiteout.&#34; The story revolves around a female US Marshall named Carrie Stetko (very well played by actress Kate Beckinsale), as she is forced to investigate a murder on an Antarctic base, just days before the long six month winter, and a powerful whiteout storm, is about to hit.<br /><br />This dramatic &#34;whodunit&#34; mystery starts off on a slow burn, but yet it never feels like it is dragging. As the body count rises, the puzzle sucks you in, not just about the murders and why they are happening, but about Carrie's own past that has brought her to this desolate wilderness. Tom Skerritt is good as the comforting doctor, while Gabriel Macht is passable as the slick Government agent. But the film almost totally rests on Kate Beckinsale's role. She makes it believable, not only through her no-nonsense attitude on the job, but through the more vulnerable parts, as the painful secret she's been running from is revealed. In some ways she's as cold and dead inside, as the environment surrounding her is outside. You develop a real empathy for her character and it sucks you right into what is happening around her. Beckinsale literally carries the main emotional thrust of the film single-handed, but she does so quite well.<br /><br />The cinematography is also extremely strong. The sweeping landscape shots easily convey the beauty and vast emptiness of the region. The dangers of those who would seek to dwell in such a place feels quite real. There are a few times, though, where the atmosphere of a terrain so hostile to human life isn't necessarily portrayed accurately, but they don't really detract that much from the film, as if you are already invested in Carrie and the mystery, you probably won't even notice them. Also, one of the red herrings on who is behind the killings is hammered on a little too often, which makes you know that person can't be the one, but that is a small quibble in an otherwise nice and taut mystery.<br /><br />Having read the graphic novel the film is based upon, I already knew who is ultimately behind the murders, but it was still a real treat to watch it unfold. For those who haven't read it, I think this film will give you the kind of intelligent thriller fans of this genre of film enjoy. Don't listen to all the haters and give this film a shot.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Hello,    So I have a Sony playstation 3 and it played avatar so well, had some friends over last night and it was amazing. the picture quality and the audio quality of this movie are just beyond imagination.    I had no problems playing the movie at all on my PS3 or my Oppo Blu-Ray players. I simply stuck in the movie and away it went. No glitches or anything. No firmware updates needed either!    Thank you FOX for putting on a show, the PQ and AQ blew my friends and I away!!! You ROCK the house and know how to party.    10 / 10 stars!

8862933177|5.0|The 5\\" by 8\\", 240-page Film Journal notebook is part of Moleskine's Passions series that also include issues for Recipes, Wellness, Books, Wines and Music. We live in a world where not too many of us can find the time to write down their thoughts, with a pen and on paper but, again, the Moleskines aren't for everyone. To the extent that there are people who not only love to write but love to write specifically about the movies they watch, the Passions series Film Journal is a notebook dream come true. But, let's examine what one gets.<br /><br />First and foremost this is a Moleskine, and it's very much true to its tradition of look, feel and quality. It comes with the traditional and most useful elastic band, nice cardboard binding that allows it to lie flat when opened without cracking the spine, excellent quality paper, rounded corners, THREE ribbon bookmarks and the 2-pocket mini accordion file inside the back cover.<br /><br />Now, this being a Film Journal, it includes a listing of a few dozen major film festivals, sorted by continent and location, an event planner, personal tabbed pages under half a dozen tabs with preprinted tab stickers to be found inside the accordion file. The main section is, of course, the movie journal. Alphabetically organized, it provides one page per movie with sections for recording the movie's title, country and year, awards won, directors, actors, quotes, notes, opinion and rating. For a movie lover who loves to write, can't get much better than this.<br /><br />I love this notebook for its quality make, its design and for its familiar look and feel. But I am repeating myself. It's a 5-star item without hesitation.

1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is the most disturbing book I have read in many years - and that's the genius of it.  Author Lisa Genova has fashioned a novel about a scholarly woman in her early 50's suffering from early onset Alzheimer's disease, and explores the toll that her disease takes on her marriage, her family, her career, and her sense of self.<br /><br />The subject matter is already sturdy stuff, but Genova ratchets up the poignancy and the heartbreak of Alice Howland's struggle by constantly changing the reader's point of view.  Sometimes we are simply observers, being told a story - but at other times, Genova puts us inside Alice's brain, forcing us to experience her confusion, her fear and her frustration as if we, too, were slowly but surely succumbing to an encroaching onslaught of dementia.  So masterful is Genova's writing that reading the novel almost becomes oppressive.  Walking in Alice's shoes becomes a harrowing - and haunting - experience.<br /><br />I can't in all honesty claim to have 'enjoyed' \\"Still Alice\\" - it's not that kind of book.  But I definitely am enriched with a greater understanding of what Alzheimer's disease is all about, and an even deeper compassion for those who live with the disease, and for those who love and care for them.  I've already passed along my copy to other members of my family who are having the same profound reaction to it that I have described in this review.  Highly recommended to those readers who seek a better understanding of this insidious and epidemic disease.
B00005QBUK|5.0|I just ordered another two pairs.  I had purchased this set about 2 years ago as a solution to the painful in-ear headphones I had been trying.  Apparently I've got small ears and earbuds either don't stay in while running or they hurt after about 5 minutes when sitting.  These were the perfect solution.  After 2 years of use, they've finally started to short out in both sides (mixture of static and silence).  But, I find them so comfortable and the perfect headphones for working out that I purchased another two pair (in case they eventually go out of stock and I need another pair).
B0017IKR7K|5.0|I usually don't write reviews for music, but I had to for 5th Gear. I usually listen to rock, but this album opened me up to a whole new genre. I heard \\"American Saturday Night\\" (off of the album of the same title) while surfing radio stations, and I was impressed. Shortly afterward, I purchased American Saturday Night and 5th Gear.<br /><br />Boy was I impressed by the quality of 5th gear. The tone of the album ranges from the hilarious \\"online\\" and \\"ticks\\" to the more somber \\"Letters to Me\\" and everything in between. There's not a bad song on this album. In a time of throw-away pop stars, Brad Paisley stands out as a rare and talented singer/musician/songwriter in any genre.
B001EO748M|4.0|A story of a sex-obsessed male happened being an English king [[ASIN:B000P12LWY continues]] turned into an explicit tale of ruthless justice ruled and very based on monarch's momentum interest and brutality much mixed with a very personal gain of juges.<br /><br />One could even be sadder to understand that this movie is not pure figures of a producers' imagination but a semi-documentary living testimony to very roots existing.
B00164KYV4|4.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\"; is a movie about communication. It sounds simple, but the movie is funny and hits the nail on the head. It has many actors that are intertwined by work, family or friends.     I found this film as entertaining and funny. I did not see awards, but something to laugh at.
B0037W68F4|5.0|This record sounds so much to he Beatles and what they could've done in any of their records. I found \\"Congratulations\\" so interesting in music and lyrics as well. These guys from MGMT are trying to come up with \\"grown up albums\\" and that's a good thing in a time where the music itself is losing credibility and surprise. I think songs like \\"It's working\\", \\"Flash delirium\\" and \\"I found a whistle\\" are the nicest tunes written on the huge influence of albums like \\"White album\\" or the \\"Let it be\\" one by The Beatles. And of course I can't pass on by \\"Siberian breaks\\" a great sucess in trying to pull of an opera number with some \\"Pink Floyd's psychodelia\\" but in a more poppy manner. On the other hand \\"Brian Eno\\" sounds like a song trying to find its way to sound like the Sex Pistols... it can't do it at the end but at least the band tried to come up with a punk number.<br /><br />Overall, the album is great and it makes me laught so hard ALL those complaints about the \\"fans\\" of MGMT saying that this album is lack of \\"hit singles\\".... you know what? long live to that!!!!! I really hope that bands like MGMT start doing this kind of records over and over again in many years to come so we can come back to what a \\"RECORD\\" used to be back in the mid/late 70's... a work of art next to albums like \\"Dark side of the moon\\" (Pink Floyd) or \\"Horses\\" (Patti Smith). Who the hell need singles when you can come up with a song like \\"Siberian breaks\\" or \\"I found a whistle\\"?
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie you can enjoy with your family. It makes you laugh although there are parts that bring tears to your eyes.  You should definitely add this one to your video library.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I won't even emphazise one song over the other on this review cause that would be just unfair to the whole concept that Natalie Merchant is playing with on this record.... this BEAUTIFUL record. It's obvious that she's beyond any expectations from the music business. She worked with this album so carefully that you notice right away that the songs here are made to reach the one and only goal: Merchant's pleasure. The arrangements on the songs are so beautiful and well done that you understand why it took her so much time to complete this album. Let's make something clear thoug, this is not a 10,000 maniacs album with all the alternative vibe or electric guitars and nice chords going on nor a \\"tigerlily\\" kind of thing.... this is a symphonic, folky, acoustic album with many roads to follow and many landscapes to enjoy. The music is the finest one you'll listen in years in any record of any kind and Merchant's voice is still breathtaking... yes, she sounds older now but still breathtaking.<br /><br />If there's something I admire about Natalie Merchant and all her mates from her age (e.g. Michael Stipe) is that she's one of those singers who has forgotten about being in a cover of a magazine or being around all the media that eventually ends up destroying the magic in music itself. She's one of those singers who has come back to share with her fans and any smart person willing to listen to her what she has come up to with \\"Leave your sleep\\".
B000AYEL6U|5.0|One of the best BBC productions I have ever watched. Normally in a mini-series I become bored, confused, bored, annoyed, bored, and embarrassed. The costumes are always ridiculous (not BBC just in general) and the hallmark card section has better scripts. This movie/mini-series breaks the mold in all areas. First off they hate each other (Pride and Prejudice) but unlike P and P Ms. Hale witnesses Mr. Thornton acting cruel to one of his worker and ultimately judges him based on this. Not yet understanding that Northern England and Southern England have different values. Needless to say this movie is full or heartbreak, learning, love, and ultimately friendship. Both of these two strong characters (and unlike P and P there are no cheesy moments I promise) go through a wonderful journey and end up discovering how much they actually have in common. If that didn't persuade you, the music will! Best soundtrack ever!     Watch the damn movie! Thank you that is all. : )
B0030Y11QK|5.0|I'm in the middle of a project to view as many Robert Altman films as possible. He made 35 films in a long career and they feature ensemble casts whose stories intertwine. Cedric Klapisch, a talented French writer and director, follows the Altman model.<br />My first Klapisch film was Chacun Cherche Son Chat (When the Cat's Away)from 1996 which features a declining Paris neighborhood with well written characters. Paris is like an expanded version of that film.<br />My next two Klapisch films, L'Auberge Espagnole from 2002 filmed in Barcelona and Russian Dolls, the 2005 sequel, featuring St. Petersburg, follow an interesting group of international students.<br />I believe Paris is his best film so far. It shows many<br />faces of the City of Light and the ensemble cast is led by Romain Duris and Juliette Binoche. We have not seen such a captivating view of Paris since the Montmartre of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie (2001).
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Ive had this cooler for a little over 4 months.    Keeps my Athlon 260 with 1.425 V low to mid 40's using occt. (I live in warm climate with high ambient temps rarely below mid 70's)    Not water cooling but for under 30 bucks great bang for the buck.    Overall the set up itself would have been simple but one of the bracket screws was mis-threaded.  required silicone and a pair of pliers to get it on.  By far was the most time consuming part of the build. On the second RMA request coolermaster did send me replacement hardware so next build I won't have the same struggle.     When Idling It is very quite, and under load, cant really hear it over my other case fans.  I will be adding a second Fan for pull push, probably dont need too, but I am having fun moding things, so why not.    One thing is it is huge.  you need at a minimum 8 inches of clearance.  If I recall my Antec Sonata III is 8.2 inches and it fits comfortably.  It is also very wide.  On my micro ATX board it covers the first RAM slot.  I might try rotating it 90 deg when I get my video card, but there is a strong possibility it will block my PCIe slot in that orientation.  Just keep that in mind if you have a mATX board, this cooler is bound to block something.

B002UNMW7O|4.0|Hiding in Ireland with their father (the grey haired assassin from Boondock Saints) for the past 8 years, the MacManus brothers are being pulled back to Boston by someone who killed a priest using their trademarks (pennies on the eyes). Of course the returning crew of police detectives from Boondock I (who have since sainted the MacManus brothers for doing what they only dream of doing...rid society of scum) don't believe they are responsible and have the pretty, big belt wearing FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (from Buffy, Angel and Dexter) who agrees. They realize that someone wants the brothers to come out of hiding. The Yakavetta Family Mob Boss (played by Judd Nelson) only knows that he wants revenge for his father's death, and the death of the Saint's is the only answer. Meanwhile, we find out how and why the Elder MacManus became a killer (ironically it was the death of his father by mobsters). There is also his eventual capture and incarceration as a result of his brandishing his own sense of justice. As the person at the center of this charade is unveiled, you will marvel at the quick and easy pace of the movie.     Now while I loved part 1, there were times in part 2 that I thought they tried way too hard. The easy flow of humor from Boondock 1, at times seemed forced in 2. I also don't think that Bloom was half as good as Dafoe's Smecker. But all in all I was satisfied with the final product, and I am sure that we will see the Saints again, I just hope Duffy goes back to some of the magic he created in Part 1. For those who just want to pick up Part 2 without seeing Part 1, I wouldn't suggest it. As a stand alone, you probably won't get or appreciate it, OR understand Part 2. But as a sequel you'll appreciate it where the Saints have been and where they are going because this movie picks up right after the last one. Either way, have a \\"Saint Marathon\\" one weekend and gooble up a great story.
0452287022|5.0|Girl With A Pearl Earring is based on the famous painting by the same name by Johannes Vermeer. Chevalier brings that mysterious woman who looks out at us from her frame to life and injects her into everyday life in Delft. Griet becomes a maid in the Vermeer household and struggles right from the start to find her place there. The one place where she finds solace is when she is cleaning the studio for the painter. Little does she know that the solace that she finds there and the attention she gets from Johannes makes people in the house become upset. As things get increasingly out of control, Griet must make some decisions that will affect her life and her place in the household.<br /><br />I initially read this book about 5 years ago - and I really didn't remember much when it came to reading it again this time. I think it probably had something to do with the fact that I had to read it for school - and that is never as enjoyable. I feel that this is one of the best art novels around - it sets the bar high for every subsequent novel.<br /><br />One of the things that I found very interesting is how different Vermeer's wife, Catherina, is portrayed in this book compared to how she is portrayed in The Golden Tulip by Rosalind Laker. In both stories a young girl goes to live with the Vermeers (in Pearl Earring as a maid and in Tulip as an apprentice). Catherina doesn't like Griet and goes out of her way to make life difficult for her. But in Tulip she is very kind and welcoming to Francesca. It's amazing how different authors can depict the same person so differently. I think I liked her much better in Tulip.<br /><br />Another aspect that I really enjoyed was how all of Vermeer's famous paintings came to life in this novel. You got to meet all of the people who sat for the paintings and it added a deeper meaning to the works. On her website, Chevalier, has the paintings juxtaposed with lines from the novel.<br /><br />Overall I very much enjoyed this story. Besides learning about the life of the artist and the paintings, I learned about the camara obscura (a box with mirrors that somehow helps the artist see his work better) and how pigments were made. This was my first Chevalier book, but it won't be my last.tist and the paintings, I learned about the camara obscura (a box with mirrors that somehow helps the artist see his work better) and how pigments were made.

B00383ZTXO|1.0|I think iggy is playing a bit of a joke on us with this one. The volume is all the way down on this recording, so you have to crank your speakers up all the way. The treble is all the way up, and the bass is all the way down. Some of the guitar solos also seem to have a drastic increase in the already jacked up treble, making for a harsh squeeking noise that actually hurts your ears. It's like listening to AM radio on a small transistor radio with a 2 inch speaker. It really sounds like an awful quality live bootleg, and I'm not talking about the bonus live disc it comes with. The volume of the vocals also fluctuates wildly, and most of \\"Gimmie Danger\\" has no drums, just a hi-hat and cymbals. This is a drastically different mix from the original 1973 bowie mix. At times this recording resembles the screeching sounds heard on albums by Throbbing Gristle. Either listen to the original or the 1997 remastered/remixed version.

If you willing to wait - pick blu-ray versions - much better quality than regular DVD and even better than HD-TV. At the time of this review (April 2010) Seasons 1 and 2 still not yet released on blu-ray. I have seasons 3 and 4 and they are outstanding picture quality.

B000B5XOQQ|5.0|Saturday afternoons were made for great adventure yarns, and serials dating all the way back to the silent era played upon our love of a rousing good jungle story, filled with danger and the thrill of discovery, with just enough romance thrown in to suggest love sprung from such exciting endeavors. RKO would make the most supreme adventure of all time and in 1933 change the expectations of moviegoers forevermore once the lights dimmed and their logo adorned screens across America. A new bar for adventure was set, and the film which raised it was King Kong. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Shoedsack helmed this fabulous RKO film from an idea by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.<br /><br />King Kong was much more than a girl screaming as a huge ape held her in his palm, just as Fay Wray was much more than a \\"B\\" icon with one great sound film to her credit. She had graced many silent productions, including Coast Patrol, Street of Sin, The Wedding March, and Paramount's last silent, The Four Feathers, where she worked with Merian C. Cooper. She made an easy transition to sound, her lovely presence and vulnerability boosting many early talkies from average to worth watching. Her importance to the success of King Kong is often not given its full due due to the staggering technical achievements behind the camera, often overshadowing everything else. Wray is simply wonderful at the beginning of King Kong, making viewers fall in love with her Ann Darrow long before Kong appears. If this was only an extraordinarily polished jungle adventure, it would be a film classic simply on the basis of Wray's performance and a timeless 1930's sense of style and adventure. With the added element of King Kong, a fearsome beast protective of something too beautiful to allow harm to come to it, it became one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong is Carl Denham, a filmmaker known for his exciting tales of adventure. A ship bound for a mysterious location only known to Denham to make a film needs only a bit of romance to satisfy the studio. Finding the lovely Ann Darrow about to pass out from hunger during the depression is a stroke of luck for the brash director. Ann is suspicious of Denham's proposal at first, but hunger and his enthusiasm, and his assurance that there are no strings attached, give Ann hope that her luck has changed. Fay Wray is wonderful in these early moments, which often get forgotten amidst the thrilling adventure encountered in the later half of the story. She endears herself to the audience early on and cements our affection for Ann once onboard. Bruce Cabot is excellent as John Driscoll, weary of having a woman onboard but soon falling in love with Anne just as viewers have. Their romance is sweet, filled with the innocent love of the era that has a timeless appeal.<br /><br />It has been breezy fun for the viewer until the ship is west of Sumatra. Denham reveals a map he has obtained in Singapore pinpointing an uncharted island where legends of a high wall and a beast called Kong are said to exist. As they approach Skull Island adventurous fun gives way to fog shrouded waters and jungle drums. The high wall does indeed exist, and after a scrape with natives enamored of Ann they find themselves confronted by a world untouched by time. Great beasts from prehistoric times roam the jungles of the island, Kong the most fearsome of all, ruling his kingdom from a high cliff where he will take Ann. Harrowing action and thrills ensue as Jack tracks his love after Kong disposes of everyone else but Carl to protect his lovely prize. The special effects still offer excitement but it is the story which makes this film such a classic. We are rooting for Jack to rescue Ann just as in the best serials, only this is no serial, but rather a topflight production creating an astounding adventure heretofore unseen in theatres.<br /><br />A gripping escape over a cliff edge will lead to Kong's demise when he follows Ann and is capturedby Carl. Billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history. High above the New York skyline, atop the Empire State Building, Ann will find herself in the arms of the man who loves her when Kong faces down dangers he never had in the jungle. It is both romantic and bittersweet. Max Steiner's score, a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose which perfectly balances romance and adventure, and sterling photography from Eddie Linden, Veronica Walker, and J.C. Taylor make this a memorable experience.<br /><br />Though Fay Wray is terrific in this film, it is a shame that many viewers only know her from King Kong. Born in Canada but raised in the United States, she was a big supporter of events held at the Empire State Building over her lifetime, and after her passing, the lights of that landmark were dimmed for fifteen minutes in her memory. King Kong is perfect viewing for a lazy Saturday and if you haven't seen it in some time, or perhaps never seen it, it is much more than you might have imagined.

B000RIWAVW|4.0|Halloween set the bar very high on horror films ! This is the best Halloween movie of all time in my opinion. The acting is great and the story is also great! Michael Myers is the ultimate bad guy/ killer.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" is about killer Michael Myers, who on halloween night goes on a killing rampage.<br />I know this sounds a little over the top, but John Carpenter does a great job at directing this film.<br /><br />Every Halloween I watch this film and when I do it always gets me a little scared.<br />Halloween is a classic movie that will/should live on far into the future.
1584282584|5.0|As a guy who picked up photography only a few years ago, I have been looking to improve my ability to improve my exposures by looking for various books and articles on the net. I never needed flash when my daughter couldn't move around much. Put the camera on a tripod and use a remote to fire away in automatic mode. No problem! But, now she is a bounding 3 year old and indoor pics required me to use a flash. The pop-up was useless for the most part since it did not give me the soft lighting and I am too lazy to get the flash off the camera and chase my daughter around with a couple softboxes and lightstands waiting for that perfect moment. Also, I did not want her eyes glowing every time I used the flash pointing directly at her. So I was stuck on the question of \\"How can I use a flash on a camera only and get soft lighting and better pictures without blinding my child in the process?\\"    Once I hit Neil's website I stopped searching for an answer. He clearly explains how a flash works, how to use his black snoot to direct and model the light and most importantly on how to mix ambient light and flash. Using the built in technology like E-TTL and hence improving speed of use while understanding light characteristics has been immensely helpful to getting better pictures.    He has distilled all those thoughts into a very informative book. It's short, to the point, very descriptive and informative with the requisite number of images to make the point. Very highly recommended by me.
0792838068|1.0|i love watching cage perform,but why he took the role in this film i'll never understand.this is an all around depressing-what the hell movie.hated it!glad i didnt buy it,but truthfully....found it on the sidewalk.guess someone else found it useless as well.......crappola plus,thats why it got one star.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I've only watched the blu-ray version twice, but it is really incredible.  I have never seen any HD to compare with this one.  The movie itself is a work of art, with an incredible level of creativity and beautiful design/ornamentation to stretch anyone's imagination.  The 3-D effect, through parallax (humans perceive 3-D by both binocular vision, for near objects, and parallax, for more distant objects)is the best I have seen.  The theme is also highly relevant to our times.  The expressivity of the actors is beyond comparison, certainly real, and enhanced by the technology used to produce this.  I really look forward to an expanded version of this blu-ray in the future, if one is forthcoming.  I have heard a popular story line related to the lack of an original story or character development in this, and it is just gibberish.  I can see how the film would be viewed as a threat to traditional Hollywood filmmaking, however.  I have seen 'Hurt Locker' that won the Academy Award for best picture, and it is a good film.  The single theme and unidimensional character of that movie was simply this:  obsession with dangerous work.  In contrast, Avatar has a great deal to say about native cultures that are close to nature (e.g., stone age cultures) in general, exploitation of resources by technology-driven societies, and the mystery of life itself.  It will make you think about the mystery of incarnation.  This is a deeply thoughtful production, a fact that should not be missed as you follow the carefully written action/adventure story line.  The theme, and the artwork, bear a signature that is unique in the history of filmmaking.  Also, if you don't already have a blu-ray, DVD-upconvert player, this is the best reason to get one now.
B000B589JI|5.0|I purchased this to go along with a small hand warmer that lasts about 12 hours per fueling.  This canister holds just enough fuel to reload the small hand warmer for another 12 hours.  It seems to seal very well and makes it very easy to refuel the warmer.  It opens with something like a built in funnel to accurately put the fuel in the correct location without spillage.  I would recommend this product as a good way to refuel a hand warmer.
0812973992|5.0|I am writing a review for this \\"purchase\\" because my fingers must have ordered it without my knowing.  Amazon was very willing to have me return it and immediately send forms for doing so.  I am very grateful for the service and am reconfirmed that Amazon is the easiest and most honest company to deal with online!
B000E5N6LG|4.0|Though I am not a big Costner fan I must aknowledge when he does some superior acting,and in this classic,based on the life of one of the greatest lawman of the West,Wyatt Earp, he does just that. Filled with a moving story featuring Wyatt's earliest days in Kansas City, through Dodge City, to Tombstone and beyond it's a long trip but never boring. I must admit that Kurt Russell's action filled \\"Tombstone\\" I find even more enjoyable to view: but as a gritty realistic view of the Earp brothers attempts at settling down, this is a must see. Excellent cast! Am instant Western classic.
030745455X|5.0|This one takes off like a rocket ship, unlike the prior novel, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. It is just as compelling as the first one but being more familiar with the characters perhaps only slightly less interesting. Lisbeth Salander is a character you cannot help but be intersted in. Leaves you wanting to read the third one.
0553381687|5.0|This is a review of the Song of Ice and Fire series, not just A Game of Thrones. Four books have been released so far--A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows. The fifth, A Dance with Dragons, is forthcoming, and two more are projected after that. You'll probably be working your way through Martin's books for a while, so I'll address the good points and you can decide whether to dive in.<br /><br />  First of all, what should be the most important part of any fiction: the characters. One of my old writing professors got shot down bad when someone asked, \\"Couldn't you pick a more interesting set of characters to endlessly explore?\\" Fortunately, Martin doesn't have that problem. His characters are an intensely gritty bunch. Some are less prepared to deal with the hard world than others, just like in real life. They get their romantic illusions shattered, though their starry-eyedness makes you half-enjoy the shattering. I think Martin does, too. Every player in the game goes through some kind of development; the \\"good\\" guys have major flaws and the \\"bad\\" guys have qualities we'd all love to possess. You may find yourself rooting for folks you despise and wanting to slap characters who are supposed to be sympathetic. For example, one character is portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, a fierce she-wolf of a woman. However, after a while you start to think her \\"devotion\\" is tantamount to mental illness. She seems in denial of a large part of life--the part having to do with death. This drives her, inexorably, to her fate, which I'll leave for you to discover. Just remember Martin is big on changes in perspective; \\"obvious\\" villains may be heroes later, and vice versa.<br /><br />  The story these people snarl and fight to bring about is addictive and original. You'll be relieved to see Martin doesn't borrow anything from Tolkien. His historical antecedents are there for all to see: the Wars of the Roses and the aftermath of Rome, for starters. However, he also brings a ton of material to the table. From the ruined castle in the depths of a humid pine forest, to the haunted hill where a stunted old spaewife meets with outlaws, every place has its history. This makes for an incredibly rich, immersive literary experience. You'll encounter folks from the highest point in society to the lowest: from knights and lords bickering about marriage contracts to strolling players looking for a bed and someone to warm it. Peasants, whores, mercenaries, scholars...no aspect of Dark Ages life is ignored. The much-touted \\"intrigue\\" doesn't come across as annoying or stupid, and Martin describes a range of experiences so vast you could compare him to Chaucer. Magic is infrequent, and thus keeps its potency. Examples: a type of steel from Old Valyria that everybody covets for its preternatural sharpness; medieval grimoire gibberish that doesn't work in Martin's world any more than the real one; and bloody sorcery that takes more from the user than it offers.<br /><br />  And now for the sex. There's a lot of it. Much of it involves violence, and women are almost invariably the targets. Martin doesn't shy away from some sordid taboo subjects, although the real-world historical precedents are here just as they are everywhere else. To be fair, the inclusion of the rough stuff is realistic enough given the setting and characters. However, it's also fair enough to warn you of it.<br /><br />  The flaws don't detract much from the overall experience, I find. Sometimes Martin has characters zip about the landscape a little too conveniently, while other journeys are hell on wheels. People in distant locales communicate with each other by means of trained ravens. These are some smart birds that never seem to get lost or shot down. They make you wonder. Finally, there was a scene in A Feast for Crows that made me question how much these medieval savages could know about Leeuwenhoekian microbiology (don't ask).<br /><br />I was surprised at how much I liked these books. Martin does a fantastic job of characterization, and importantly, his fictional world doesn't give the impression that it exists as nothing more than a vehicle for prophecies and thinly disguised Ring-quests. This is what I can't stand about most fantasy fiction. Thankfully, though, Martin takes great pains to keep his setting low, dirty, and credible while maintaining the fantastic elements. You'll read, you'll sympathize, and hopefully, you'll believe and get something out of it.how much I liked these books.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|This review is based on the assumption that the reader has both played FF:7 and has seen the original Advent Children. If not, well, don't blame me if I lose you somewheres~~<br /><br />Having been a big fan of the original release, it was all but decided that when I got my PS3, adding this movie to the archives was a requisite. However, as is the case when I meet an upscaled movie, show, or whatever, I tend to whip out the fine-toothed comb and pick it to pieces, either completely shredding said content, or finding completely new aspects to magnify. In Advent Children: Complete's (further abbreviated as AC:C) case, I met with a compromise. The bonus content, as well as the added/edited scenes, counterbalanced most of the issues that arose in the conversion, as well as the translations, which will be expounded upon in the following paragraphs.<br /><br />First, the likes/loves of AC:C. Where to start except for the most obvious; the fact that it's Blu-Ray. And Blu-Ray means High-Def scaling. As I love to say, everything looks better in Blu-Ray, and AC:C is indeed no exception. The added scenes are all redone to match 1080p dimensions, and the original content is all upscaled to fit. Where the original looked good on a standard definition TV, Complete retains that ability with HD-TVs. And if that wasn't enough to sate any appetite, Nobuo Uematsu (whose fame as one of the gods of video game music should be well-known to most, if not all) redid a majority of the soundtrack to compensate for new and edited scenes, as well as personal tweaks for the new version. And I'd be damned (can I even say that?) to say it's anything less than spectacular. However, the most pleasing change was a constant, in that the ending still remained Calling by Himuro Kyousuke, a song which I still love, but with the added bonus of a quick story scroll during said credit roll. The biggest section of this paragraph, however, goes to the story changes. With almost a half an hour of new content alone, AC:C takes the story of Advent Children even deeper. Many circumstances surrounding the Geostigma, as well as character's pasts and events pertaining, have further explanation. Not to mention, extended battle scenes, visible wounds/blood (a HUGE plus in my books, irked the daylights out of me in the first one), and overall more movie to enjoy. I won't spoil anything major here, as this review may actually assist someone in their purchase (never know!), but I was quite pleased with Reno and Rude's extended scene times, as well as the extended backstory with Cloud and Zack (for those of us who never cared enough for the FF:7 prequel they released). And on a tangent, concerning all these new scenes is a new dialogue, which of course, requires translation. And for once in my long and somewhat illustrious anime-viewing career, the company hired for the translation and subtitles did not make me want to rip hair, pull nails, rend flesh, gnash teeth, etc. I don't speak much in the way of Japanese, but I do have a decent understanding of it, and complete and utter misinterpretations, or outright topic shifts (they have happened!) will irk me to no end. Advent Children's original translation was subpar at best, by my standards. AC:C's translation was better than good, but not quite great. There were a few lines that would have been better in straight translations (Black sheep in happy flock = traitor?), but compared to the original, which, for some reason, made Cid to be some kind of cowboy (I still seek the villain responsible), AC:C is far and away an improvement. All in all, this is a fine example of what Director's Cuts should be made of.<br /><br />Naturally, no review of mine is ever complete without me having some kind of gripe. In AC:C's case, there weren't many, but they were major to be sure. The biggest one is also the most glaringly obvious. The original movie was blatantly upscaled. And by blatantly, I mean to the point that (for those who have the originaland have watched it enough to remember scenes) certain parts are almost pixelated in detail. For a discerning eye such as mine, this can be rather painful to deal with, even more so because the added scenes, by contrast, are scaled to fit widescreen dimensions. Granted, I'm sure I come off as being trivial about pointless details, but to each their own. The next gripe pertains to the upscaling which, while not being involved in it, was a part of it, and that is the scene editings for blood, dirt, grime, and, to put it simply, looking like they did stuff. I welcome the change, but at the same time, I loathe it, for two reasons. One, just splashing mud color in random places on clothing DOES NOT add any realism, just like putting circular dots in a row does not make a rectangle. Two, it's going to look bad when you apply an edit in High-Def format to something still in Standard Definition. Is it horribly noticeable? Not really, unless you're looking, actively or passively, for such things. Will you see it though? You bet. And my final gripe has to deal with some of the extended scenes. Some of them, and by some I mean about two to three, made me wonder \\"Why in God's name is this here?\\" Case and point example (if you're concerned about spoilers in any way, shape, or form, skip the following and the next two sentences! Look for the next parentheses to continue.); when Denzel knocks the cap off the hydrant. Is spinning a pipe around above your head really necessary to knock that cap off? Couldn't you have just hacked at it a couple more times instead of thinking that twirling a pipe above your head would have ANY impact on your physical strength? (End minor spoiler) It's a scene that just bothers and annoys me to no end (tl;dr - IMADBRO), but this is not a perfect world that revolves around yours truly, and I must make do with such things.<br /><br />The Final Word.<br /> For those who managed to make it through that, congrats, because your reward is probably the only thing you were looking for in the first place, my overall opinion. Well, that's assuming my opinion actually mattered to anyone, but let's not be moody and depressing, right? Overall, FF:7 AC:C was and is a worthy movie for those who have watched the original, wanted to watch the original, or even have remotely delved into the Final Fantasy universe. Granted, playing the game provides a greater clarification of events, but it's not absolutely necessary. My final grade is 4 stars out of 5. If you wish to see the grading scale, continue reading.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I normally don't review movies. But I felt the need to review this one.<br /><br />The hype of Avatar before it came out, without a doubt made me curious but not curious enough to actually watch the movie. A movie 2+ hours is not something I want to spend my time doing. My husband borrowed this from his mother and insisted I watched it. Fine. Okay. Whatever.<br /><br />The movie IS long and I DID get pretty restless towards the end but the story itself hooks you and pulls you into the movie. The acting is amazing, the story line is interesting, the action in the movie is amazing, the effects and the graphics were also amazing!<br /><br />A story of two creatures from two completely different worlds finding a way to see passed their differences, their missions and to help each other.<br /><br />And at the same time, it makes you hate the US military. My husband (who's Air Force) just noticed how most movies make the military look bad. Never noticed til he said something! It's a little disappointing.<br /><br />But the movie? Amazing. Worth sitting through for 2+ hours!
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Robert Downey Jr. is sadly miscast in a movie that has nothing to do with the esprit of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Not that this movie isn't entertaining, but I draw the line at the inaccurate application of the Hollywood action movie formula to classic literature. For any enthusiasts of Granada or BBC productions, steer clear of this. It's frankly offensive.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is what I call wonderful listening! I can listen to her voice all day and then again the next day.....wonderful!
0810993139|4.0|I came across this book first because a number of the students in my Special Education class absolutely could not put it down.  If you're looking for a book/series to engage reluctant readers, look to Kinney.      While arguably not \\"classic literature,\\" this book does capture what a middle-school boy might write in a journal and presents as an easy, inviting read that is definitely fun and amusing.  Similar in style to the popular Captain Underpants series, I personally prefer Kinney's series as a bit more sophisticated and witty, having read through a few Captain Underpants books myself.      If you're interested in reading more about this book and other really good reads, both for your students and for yourself, you can check out my blog: ReadABookReview DOT blogspot DOT com   [...]    I'd love your comments!

0545123267|4.0|Let me start off by telling you that I'm a Twilight fan... True to the story and characters (not a crazy obsessed teeny bopper) and because of this I am always looking for books in this genre. I came across Shiver by sheer accident. Not sure of its potential, I decided to check it out from the library instead of buying it. I literally began reading it and couldn't put it down. I carried it in my purse and found myself reading at any free moment. So if you like love stories with a twist, give this one a try.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is without a doubt the best concert I have had the pleasure of watching.  Top class entertainers and talent with a wonderful tribute to a great guitar player and person.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Enjoy!!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I wish I would have watched this movie earlier in my life.  It's so ridiculously hilarious.  I love Kane.  He reminds me of an over-the-top friend I had in college, except my friend had SOME stability.<br /><br />But if Kane had stability, where would his ambition have gone?  It would have taken a back seat to his stability.  Sort of like my desire for stability keeps me hushed up about the dream I have of promoting G-rated Shock Value.<br /><br />The message of this movie seems to be that personal ambition makes for an awesome story, but a horrible lifestyle.  No one watches this darn movie to see who or what Rosebud is.  People watch this movie to see the rise and fall of a man with an insane dream.  That's what makes the script of this movie so strong and gives it so many memorable quotes.  Kane clearly believes all the garbage he spews, even though he knows it's garbage.  Nowhere is this more clear than when he refuses to drop out of the race for governor.  For me, that's the defining moment of the film right there.<br /><br />Best movie of all time?  Eh, that's debatable.  While it's certainly up there with movies like Mary Poppins and Annie Hall, it's tough to pick which is THE best.  It should be enough to say I like everything about this film.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Gosh this was a seriously great movie and why it didn't win best movie....I will never know. But it totally should have. Not The Hurt Locker. Although I didn't like The Hurt Locker I'm defiantly not here to bash it. I bet that it was really good, but I have a different opinion. This movie is like if you crossed Pocahontas with Star Wars and another really good action movie (that I don't have the time to think up). And it wasn't a bad shallow version about people killing other species. If I was a English teacher I would show this move for my students to write a analysis paper on.There was so much depth in this movie that it still makes me cry. It showed the greed of humans, having the respect of nature and all the that surrounds us, the ability to chose between right and wrong and the courage to do something about it. This movie was amazing and I wish that I could meet the person who thought up the background and the setting of Pandora, the animation is just gorgeous. I would so like to live there (if the air didn't kill me) But about the actual product displayed it does have a few problems. If you have a blue ray player it won't play the normal version. And there is no 3D (but I don't really care about that) but if you don't get this version of the DVD thats ok. BUT.... I URGE you to BUY THIS MOVIE!!!! It is SO EPIC!!!!!!! The best movie of 2010!!!!! No contest!!
B000002L7R|4.0|Around the World in a Day is a grower. It improves and becomes more addicting in continued listens. For a few years this was not one of my favorite Prince albums but now it certainly is. I would pick it over Parade or Lovesexy, any day of the week.<br />I think it is funny that Prince claimed that The Beatles did not influence this album... Because it all screams Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I wonder what the true inspiration was.<br />Thank U for the beautiful music, Prince!<br />In my eyes, he was the greatest musician and entertainer the world has ever seen.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|As an English teacher in Europe and as someone who has watched almost all his movies, I can say that I am once more convinced that Michael Moore has an important message to tell that nobody else sums up in such a graphic and at the same time humorous way.  I have learned a lot about America - even if what he presents is a biased account - and I consider his movies to be a brilliant trigger for discussions in class.
B0026PA05M|4.0|Wow.  Great album.  It's unfortunate that with the internet so prevalent nowadays, it takes me longer to find good music like this than it did in 1982 with MTV and rock radio.  Rock radio is nearly dead in my local area of Boston with WBCN switching to sports talk.  I just happened to stumble on this through a chain of lucky clicks.  I played it for my daughter and she said   \\"well I know what I'll be buying from iTunes when I get home\\".  I think the key thing that makes each of these songs so good is that, unlike many of the \\"ok\\" rock bands of today, Halestorm  understands that you need to vary the pacing of the melody over the course of each song.  Strong highs and soft lows make great rock.  They've re-embraced the guitar solo as well, which you seldom see nowadays. Most rock produced since 1996 is just too flat from start to finish to be considered anything more than \\"ok\\" background noise with a competent but mostly vanilla lead singer.  The thing that really sealed the deal for me was the live acoustic performance I looked up on Youtube.  I generally want to know that if I happen to fall into concert tickets, I won't be disappointed.  I highly suggest viewing those acoustic videos, Lzzy and the band are the real deal.  They sound like a band playing their music, well, not a band \\"trying\\" to play their music, poorly, which is all too rare in this day in age.  This is a solid four star album, I'd give it five, but I reserve five stars for albums that \\"transcend\\", true past and future classics with near infinite replay value, such as: (GnR - Appetite for Destruction, Heart - The Road Home, The Zeppelin boxed set, Ozzy's Randy Rhoads Tribute Album, etc.).  Hopefully Halestorm will produce that type of album some day, they seem to have the potential tools in place.
B0036EH40Q|1.0|I have the movie, To[[ASIN:B0036EH40Q Tombstone  [Blu-ray]]]mbstone, in standard DVD format and eagerly awaited the BLue Ray release.  What a bummer, there was no side sound at all.  Don't waste your money on this release.
0446567337|5.0|I loved this book.  I run hot and cold on Sparks, but thought this one was a real winner.  The plot is very engaging and his writing style is delightful to read.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the character's actions (e.g. Savannah not waiting for John) were disappointing, but I could get past that because I was so wrapped up in the story.  I really felt like I knew these people and I could actually understand her decision, even if it was a choice I wish she hadn't made.  I would love to read a sequel to this book!    Bottom line: Nicholas Sparks at his finest.
1554072840|4.0|My daughter loves the Once Upon a Potty Video but likes looking at the pictures of this book even more.  It's a great learning aid and is indeed a cute story of how Prudence goes from learning to use a potty, to becoming a proudly potty-trained little girl!
B001HN694K|2.0|Why does Tim Burton keep making the same movie? He was very original, and at his prime, with his films like \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" \\"Ed Wood,\\" \\"Mars Attacks,\\" \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" and especially \\"Big Fish.\\" But it seems that for the past few years he has been regurgitating the same movie again and again, no matter what the title. It has gotten to the point that as long as you know his style, all they have to do is announce that Burton is doing Charlie or Sweeney or Alice, and I feel like I've seen it already. I can visualize it, therefore I don't need to watch his overanimated rendition of it. It's always better in my mind because he has such awesome potential, but then he just botches the whole thing up.<br />  Johnny Depp has been one of my favorites since he's been on screen, but it seems as though he does not know how to say \\"no\\" to his good friend, even when it may be better for his career (which, I guess is respectable to a degree). I honestly believe that he did not have as much fun with his role as the Hatter as he could (and should) have. The character was too down-to-earth. The Scottish dialect transitions did NOT work. They made him less MAD and more RANDOM, and were completely out of context. I feel that his character, and possibly the entire idea of Burton doing Alice, was less because there was a demand for (ANOTHER) interpretation of a story that nothing in this world can convince me to care about, and more aimed to sell the trendy \\"today's Burton/Depp project\\" merchandise at Hot Topic to all the fashion-challenged sixteen-year-old teenybopper girls. I LOVE Depp's Willy Wonka...*LOVE it*...but I felt as though I was watching Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka pretending to be Jack Sparrow with a James M. Barrie alter-ego as opposed to actually being pulled in to The Mad Hatter as a charismatic, mad, and most importantly, NEW character.<br />  Helena Bonham-Carter is still boning the director, so of course she's in the movie.<br />  Though I remember going to the cinema and throwing down the dough to see it and actually sitting through the entire thing, I feel like I am still waiting to see the new \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie that I was actually excited about.

B00371QQ2U|1.0|I strongly concur... this is the WORST disk interface ever.  I tried loading and navigating the menus that finally pop up.  Hitting \\"Play\\" does something really annoying: first, the \\"menu\\" disappears, but the typical loop of background video continues for 4 minutes.  Then, the screen goes completely dark for at least 4 more minutes.  There is no indication of \\"loading the movie\\" or \\"please wait\\" or any feedback. The problem is that, if your blu-ray player is NOT connected to the internet, the disk's programming gets stuck and refuses to play the disk.  There is a remedy in some cases: you can program (at least in my case) the player to ignore any internet connecting.  But this disk is one among thousands that has this defect, which can seem perplexing.
B0037W68F4|4.0|Well this is interesting, the fans are divided based on the posts here. From my perspective, I give this four stars, good, not great. It is a mash up of different 60's bands like The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Moody Blues, with a dash of Yes in places. This is modern day 60's of course. Now, you will either like that or not. I like it. I liked their first album too.<br /><br />There's only nine tracks, and that's fine by me. It reminds me of all the great 70's and 80's albums that were short and to the point before the self-indulgent 90's arrived and whiny music became the rage. There are nine tracks, but one is an instrumental, the weakest song of the lot. \\"Lady Da Da's Nightmare\\" could have been left as a b-side, and it wouldn't have been missed.<br /><br />This leaves eight tracks, all good, but none that would qualify as radio-friendly, which is also fine by me. I really liked \\"It's Working\\" and \\"Song For Dan Treacy\\". Two stomping openers to introduce to where the band wants to go this time. This is followed by \\"Someone's Missing\\" with it's Marvin Gaye breakdown at the end. \\"Flash Delirium\\", the unofficial first 'single' if you want to call it that, is also good. \\"I Found A Whistle\\" is very similar, I think, to their \\"The Youth\\" from their last album. Then comes this 12 minute opus \\"Siberian Breaks\\". Now, you are either going to suck this down or spit it out. Already being a fan of progressive rock such as Yes, King Crimson, ELP, Genesis and Rush, I enjoyed it, even right down to all the different segments within (a page torn right out of the Yes songbook). \\"Brian Eno\\" was an interesting choice and rather humorous especially if you are familiar with who he is, who he has produced, and what kind of music he has made on his own. \\"Congratulations\\" is a good song to end the album.<br /><br />So what's the fuss? This album isn't all that different from their debut. Their debut mashed up different musical genres, but this is more 1960's in its approach and feel with some 1970's prog rock thrown in for good measure. Someone said this isn't original, and maybe that's true, but I can't think of who else is willing to take these risks these days (though MGMT does share styles with Animal Collective and Surfer Blood).<br /><br />Four stars for good music. Four stars also for their debut album, which, to be fair, was slightly better than this, their sophomore album, but not by much.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|This is not so much about Avitar but about DRM.    It may be worthwhile for some smart legal folks to help put together a class action suit against Sony and whomever who keeps forcing failures to occur with older Blu Ray players. This change of DRM that creates havoc for earlier investors of blu ray players is just excessive greed and more than unethical.    Casettes, Audio CD, VHS, DVD all are easily defeated in the attempts to archive by owners their data - blu ray will be no different. This attempt by changing DRM at the expense of the very audience they sell to is pure abuse.    So let's see - owners of Blu Ray Players may not be able to play future Blu Ray Discs due to changes in DRM and inability to \\"update firmware\\" is BAD BUSINESS.    So lets see - Studios are double dipping into the consumers pocket by re-releasing later (intentionally) extended additions or more valued copies (whether improved quality, features or material) is BAD BUSINESS.    I truly hope that all involved in distributing Avitar on Blu Ray take a huge hit on this debacle.
B000G759LW|1.0|Aggie's 2006 '20's meets the 00's' double album is the moment in time where the dreadful, shrieking has-been's ego finally grew larger than her nose.<br /><br />It's another 'reinvention' which means for her, as she's incapable of anything else, the same old sleazy, hard-faced woefully unattractive hooker wannabe as she ruins every song (almost) with her appalling over-singing whilst stripping off in her videos.<br /><br />As 'Back To Basics' only sold 17 copies, it's unlikely you'll remember anything from it but the typically shocking lead single, 'Ain't No Other Man' made a brief appearance on the charts. Like the rest of CD1, it's insanely over produced and there's not one moment's respite from her horrible voice. She'll sing the chorus, but as she does so, 'another' Christina bellows and screeches gibberish over the top of it! It's like one of her isn't enough! Same thing with any kind of instumental break, there she is again, honking, cooing, just making needless NOISE. She can't bear to be silent for a second.<br /><br />The low point of, well, all time probably, is 'Thank You', a five minute non-song in which Aggie actually shuts up for a couple of minutes while scores of demented, sorry, devoted fans tell her how great she is and 'thank' her endlessly! You get the feeling Aggie would love to join in and thank herself but does manage to restrain herself. Total insanity, or egomania. I can't decide.<br /><br />CD2, the '20's, 30's and 40's' one is quieter, but still awful. It's completely bereft of any kind of memorable material and is perhaps the moment 'Xtina' went insane. You'd have to totally deluded to think this kind of rubbish passes as artistry. One track, 'Save Me From Myself' (a cry for help?!), has Aggie just singing the song simply and maybe showing  how good she could be if someone would have the guts to tell her to tone it down once in a while. Sadly, it's not all good news as the song is absolute cr%p!<br /><br />There were no other hits from 'Back To Basics' and Xtina soon slunk away to lick her wounds before returning a couple of years later with a best of album that was incredibly light on actual popular songs.<br /><br />As I write, Aggie is set to return in a month with her new opus, 'Bionic'. The signs aren't good. The first single, the hideous 'Not Myself Tonight', is the same old noisy, tuneless, oversung crud and would happily fit in on CD1 of BTB. The video is a blatant Lady Ga Ga/Madonna rip off with Xtina reinventing herself as, yes, you guessed it, a tired old scrubber who strips off a lot!

B002JG67L4|5.0|Great DVD from a great band.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show, a must see. The fact that it was cancelled in the middle of season one is just another example of how idiotic Hollywood executives can be. Bean counters and greedy suits should not have the power to pass judgement over things they do not understand. One of the tragedies of TV these days is that no one has any patience. The show got axed early because it wasn't 'hitting the numbers' to be kept around. Sometimes it takes more than four months to build an audience, but the brainless idiots at Fox could not understand that! You should have seen the heaping pile of dung they replaced Firefly with, not impressive at all.    What really got me though was why the Sci-Fi channel did not pick it up after it was cancelled. Sci-Fi network seems to prefer the cheesy B- garbage that they play most of the time.    Watch this DVD, but I warn you it will be bitter sweet. You will fall in love with it, then be left wanting more, and then you will curse the Show Biz big shots for being so damned stupid for cancelling this show!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|From its very beginning, the overall mood of The xx's debut release escorts the listener down a rainy highway, and its desolate atmospheres deepen the impact of its sometimes poignant lyrics.  The catchy minimalism of \\"xx\\" has made The xx the \\"new cool thing\\" in some circles, and I suspect that right now, bittersweet breakups and intimate moments between many, many couples are occurring with \\"xx\\" as their soundtrack.  Despite their indie hype, this increased visibility is warranted.  \\"xx\\" is a welcome reprieve from the explicitly nostalgic turn that currently seems to be all the rage.<br /><br />The xx are not virtuosos in the classic sense.  Bassist/singer Oliver Sim, however, plays bass and sings expressively with seemingly little effort; a task that takes no small amount of musicianship.  Along with guitarist and singer Romy Madley Croft, they have a sexy synergy that makes \\"xx\\" simultaneously masculine and feminine.  Couples with a shared interest in addictively singable tunes and starry atmospheres will most likely find lots of common ground.<br /><br />I would say that the atmosphere on \\"xx\\" is dreamy, but not hallucinogenic.  There are times when The xx dips into Pink Floyd territory, but there is in no way a longing for psychedelia.  Instead, perhaps the reverby soundscapes of mid-period Cure is the most appropriate comparison, while the loose, unassuming guitar seems to recall Lou Reed.  In total, this atmosphere, like many albums that feature simple, reverb-laden guitar, recalls the dark beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack for \\"Twin Peaks.\\"<br /><br />The entire album is pretty consistent, so if you have heard a little of their work, the rest of the album will pay off.  Suggesting specific tracks for the uninitiated is a little difficult, but the song that piqued my interest in The xx was \\"Crystalized.\\"  That song pretty much sums up their work as well as any.  The lyrics to \\"Crystalized\\" describe a desire for intimacy that is tempered by a frustrated alienation.  Both Croft and Sims sing a unique verse separately, but then simultaneously sing these verses on top of each other, as if to speak so loudly as to not hear.  This is the sort of subtle emotional tension that pervades \\"xx\\" as w whole.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN: The xx are wonderfully minimal, and certainly write catchy tunes, but beyond that, \\"xx\\" is an album that can be listened to and appreciated on multiple levels.  On one level, it is melodic and accessible enough to invite the listener to sing along.  It also, however, has the capability to provide a \\"still moment\\" in a hyperactive day, in which the listener can look out a window into a grayer world that is somehow more vivid.ft and Sims sing a unique verse separately, but then simultaneously sing these verses on top of each other, as if to speak so loudly as to not hear.

B003405MF6|2.0|Emotion and Commotion was quite a letdown for me.  It sounds as if Jeff Beck is providing background session work... for himself!  If this is where Jeff's head is at after seven-odd years since his last album, he must be more interested in making a \\"nice\\" record of easy-listening music rather than guitar-prominent sounds.  Promoting vocalists and orchestra would be forgiveable if Jeff were doing something notable on guitar.  But he doesn't.    I purchased the Best Buy edition that included a 28-minute DVD of Jeff at the 2007 Crossroads Festival.  This DVD was far more interesting than the CD.    Let's be honest.  To really be a \\"guitar god\\" you've got to play the hell out of your instrument, continue to search for chords and notes of interest, and to really be the whole package, write and sing lyrics.  Listen to Jimi Hendrix, Robin Trower, and Tony McPhee of the Groundhogs... these guys played and played, wrote some interesting lyrics, and sang while playing [while not singing on his \\"hits\\", Trower has begun singing several of his more recent songs, both in the studio and in concert].    Emotion and Commotion falls far short of what Jeff Beck is capable of and has done in the past.  If he doesn't write lyrics and won't sing, then he has to play his guitar with great distinction, such as Joe Satriani or Steve Vai.  Beck's new album is very disappointing.  Lacking in quality, it also lacks in quantity, coming in at a mere 40 minutes.    Jeff, don't be like Eric Clapton.  He hasn't done anything noteable since the days of Derek and the Dominoes and Layla.  And of course Clapton had Duane Allman helping him back then!    Listen to Frank Marino play Somewhere Over The Rainbow on his Real Live album, and you'll forget all about Jeff's version.

Well, i laughed as hard at her as i did at the movie.<br /><br />It is a movie about being laid off, so if you have been laid off during this ecconomicly hard time i would think twice about seeing it before you get another job. it CAN be a little on the depressing side if you let it.<br /><br />George Clooney has the same comic meter that he did in Oceans 11 and i loved that one too. It just doesn't have the great ensamble cast that Ocean's 11 had.<br /><br />The wedding scene was the down part of this movie. i don't even know why Ryan's family was written into this, but it was. you have to take the bad with the good, and the ending was classic, even if you did see it coming an hour before hand.

Everyone has something to learn about the war, and its effects on the soldiers who fought there, from this seminal work. Easily the definitive first-hand narrative on the subject, Mason's empathetic, coming-of-age perspective, witnesses his cowardice (chicken) and courage (hawk) in combat. His story is impossible to put down, honest, and sometimes humorous. The tragedy, and horror of human conflict, are written indelibly, in this readable tale, that puts the sound of thudding rotor blades in your ears, the gritty taste of Pleiku dust in your mouth, and leaves the vision of graceful, burning, machine gun tracers, coming out of the jungle at night, etched forever in your memory.
1591843162|4.0|I really loved the beginning and middle of this book. I thought it was remarkable, maybe even revolutionary! But then the last third of it disappointed me. I think, to coin a phrase used by the author, that it was \\"shipped\\" too soon.<br /><br />If Seth Godin had perhaps let the manuscipt sit for a while, maybe a year, and then had come back to it and revised the last third with renewed energy, I think he could have had a Malcolm Gladwell kind of hit on his hands.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's still a worthwhile read. I just think it could have been so much more. It's kind of like having an amazing meal at a five-star restaurant where everything is absolutely perfect until the chef rushes the cooking of the dessert and it is burnt around the edges and the coffee isn't fresh. Most of the meal was remarkable, but it's hard to forget those last few bites.<br /><br />Susan Gabriel<br />author of Seeking Sara Summers

B002VPE1B6|3.0|I went ahead and sprung for this at Amazon.com for the 2 disc set, 1 a Blu-Ray, one a DVD.  Well, right out of the box the Blu-Ray disc refused to play on my Sony Blu-Ray player, so I watched in on the DVD in my Blu-Ray player.  This was a great special effects movie, but the plot became a little silly with Sigourney Weaver playing some chain smoking Doctor (a chain smoking environmentalist/psychiatrist? gimme a break) with an attitude trying to learn the culture and language of the 10 foot tall blue aliens on Pandora, all the while trying to keep the evil corporation and Marines from upsetting her noble and environmentally and culturally sensitive efforts, kind of like some of her last episodes in Aliens. The hero turns out to be a former Marine Corporal who is paralyzed from the waist down, but under some kind of futuristic MRI like tanning bed device gets transported to Pandora sub-consciously and becomes an Alien clone with full use of his legs again, replete with the HDMI like tail for linking into the flora and fauna and other aliens in Pandora to communicate with the \\"soul\\" of the other beings.  His mission is to learn the natives cultures and language.  In the process he has to deal with a cornucopia of bizarre creatures, some of which are like flying Pterodactyls, Triceratops and giant panthers and wild dog/hyena creatures and other assorted gruesome beasts, kind of like a Jurrasic Park redux. In the end, the evil silver haired, buzz cut Marine \\"Gung-Ho (Ooh-Rah!) Colonel (who works out daily and is a one man destruction force) leads a large invasion force of futuristic hover craft flying machines with massive fire power to lay waste to the aliens sacred grounds and the former Marine Corporal leads an uprising (Shades of Dances with Wolves), who after horrendous losses and unimaginable environmental destruction, finally prevail. I think I am beginning to see a trend here coming out of Hollywood.<br />Oh, and I forgot to mention, the former Marine Corporal falls in love with the daughter of the alien chief who is already spoken for by a fierce warrior alien and the has to prove himself and does so by taming the largest Pterodactyl Godzilla like creature and wins her heart and they \\"mate\\".

B001I82RVS|1.0|This is absolutely the worst film I've ever seen.  I wasted a lot of money on this.  Yes, the price they're asking is too much for me.  You would have to pay me for me to watch this garbage again.  I made it most of the way through the film but it's just torture watching this.  I think I'm going to start renting movies on my PS3 instead of just buying films based off of good reviews.    Why do I hate it so much?  Well to start I was looking for a gore film.  If they kept it just to the gore and had more of a story I might of enjoyed it.  There is plenty of gore but what goes on in this film is bizarre and disturbing.  There are many violent sexual situations, violence on children, and very bizarre sex.  I tried to laugh at the supposed jokes but they're not funny.  An example would be the wrist cutting jokes.  That is the least offencive of all of them.  They're so bad I can't even mention the others.  In my opinion you would have to be very sick person to get enjoyment out of watching this film.  This film is more disturbing than any film I've ever seen in my life.     I recommend blood the live action film.  It has gore but it doesn't tread where it shouldn't or really cross the line.  Still, I wouldn't even let the kids near that.
1440469563|5.0|I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared by [[ASIN:0375757422 Emma (Modern Library Classics)]], and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others were [[ASIN:1451539290 Pride And Prejudice]], and [[ASIN:1440468397 Persuasion]]<br />  As with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews.  In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer.  In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:<br />Many reviewers profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"<br />  I must take issue!<br />1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself?  They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book.  If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope.  The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two.  Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing!  Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.<br />2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree.  Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!<br />3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.)  Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!<br />4.  Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control!  And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.<br />I need say no more, and direct the reader to start \\"clicking\\" all four of the above into your carts!es it offers the reader.<br />I need say no more, and direct the reader to start \\"clicking\\" all four of the above into your carts!

My only criticism matches that of an earlier reviewer in that we are a little short-changed in descriptions of what happens to some of the characters as things transpire and close. Still, it doesn't really detract from the main story line and I am still fully sated and still want more. Strout was born to write!
0060989157|4.0|The band members of Motley Crue truly open up about being worshipped by so many fans especially the ladies at that time.  All of them open up about their experiences with being successful music artists, and also about their own personal struggles that led to all of thier drug and alchol problems in a period that presented little knowledge of addiction and rehab.  If you enjoy biographies that explain all of the dirt that is both hardcore and explicit, then you will be captivated by this read.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a good entertaining show, with consistantly good acting and writing.  We enjoyed most if not every show of this first season.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Wow! this is the best stuff I have heard in I don't know how long! kind of a mix between gnarles barkley and the black keys. I debated about ordering this for a couple of days...I am so glad I did. How do you like me now is a great song, and believe it or not, that is not the best song on the cd. These guys deserve to be heard.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I clicked this on Netflix yesterday just to see what it was and, like other reviewers, expected it to be nothing special (probably because of the \\"classic albums\\" moniker). In fact, it was an incredibly well-done documentary, with thoughtful contemporary interviews with each of the band members, plus Alan Parsons, Storm Thorgensen and others involved in the album.  For musicians it is fascinating to hear them talk about how the tracks were developed and to see them, all these years later, reconstruct the music we've come to know so well. This is essential for any Floyd fan, but also highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the music creation process.
0670021652|4.0|love Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style. Just when you are a little \\"fact-ed out\\" she throws in a naturally funny line. If you are married, divorced, or considering a 2nd marriage, this is a must-read. As I have always believed, this book reminds us all that when you are married, it is the foundation of your life and you tread carefully and with love & respect. And it's ok to be a bit afraid now & then too :)
B000002J0B|2.0|did not purchase this item, so i do not know how it got on my review page. However, i know of this album since i was a kid. i liked led zeppelin. but i never bought this album even in the 70's when it came out. I hate the song \\"stairway to Heaven\\" it was played one million times since the album came out. It is so worn out and over played.    I did purchase Led Zeppelin III and it is an excellent album/c.d.
B00005221L|5.0|[[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]] is a true sci-fi classic. Like the [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)]], a powerful alien creature slaughters humans like cattle.     What makes [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]] so great - and what more recent copycats lack - is a great cast of characters and dramatic scenes. Far from just being cannon fodder, you actually start to like Dillon and Blane and the rest. I'll never forget the scene when Dillon becomes so nervous he breaks his razor while shaving - what a great way to add tension to the scene. Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job of being both tough and in control.     Remarkably, for a film over 23 years old, the special effects don't seem dated at all. That's another great thing about the way the movie was made - rather than stuffing it with computer-generated graphics, the filmmakers used the technology they had in creative ways to accomplish what they needed. The result is more subtle and interesting, including not knowing what the Predator looks like until the end rather than shooting dozens of closeup shots of CG Predators..    If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a high quality blu-ray version out yet, but the regular DVD is just fine.     Interesting sidenote: two of the actors in this film, Schwarzenegger and Jesse Venture, later become governors. That could only happen with a quality movie!
B0026IBY72|4.0|Like so many others, I am shamelessly addicted to the world of Jane Austen as portrayed not only by her writing but by the movie productions by A&E and BBC. Sadly, I find a lot of similarities between myself and the main character in Austenland, Jane, who is hopelessly searching for her own Mr. Darcy. In this book you will get a little taste of what it would be like to live in Jane Austen's world and you might find that it's not necessarily all it's cracked up to be and that Mr. Darcy is only fairy tale. But that doesn't mean there still can't be a happy ending, right? Definitely an enjoyable read. :)
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|So many \\"fans\\" that boo this album, they've done it over and over whether demon days or the clint eastwood era. Amazing cd from start to finish, surprise artist appearances like bobby womack (110th st). They put all they had into this album and I hope it isn't the last one, was very random seeing this release though. I came onto cdnow one day and thought wow finally! have been waiting for another release for quite some time and this does hit home.
0385311400|5.0|Great used book in a wonderful series.  Good service, excellent price, quick delivery.  If you haven't discovered books by Diana Gabaldon, you are missing a rich reading experience. These books are big (800+ pages in each book of this series), and expensive to buy new.
1577314808|5.0|I, like many others, have already read many books on inner peace and the like. But this book has just opened my mind in whole new ways. The way this author words everything is perfect. I used to have a really bad problem with constant anxiety, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it was coming from or even how to get rid of it. Thanks to the guidance in this book, that is now all but a thing of the past for me. I cant believe though this book has been out for over ten years, and I am just now coming across it. But of course that's completely irrelevant, and I'm just so happy to of found it now. :)
B003JYQD96|5.0|I was browsing shows the other day after watching a few episodes of true blood ive heard about vampire diaries but didnt know if i would like it or not so I downloaded the first 5 episodes and by the end of the 3rd episode i knew i was hooked and had to buy the rest so I did and have not regretted it this show is tottally addictive and I haven't stopped watching it literally this is the best show on TV if you like vampires and romance you will deffinatly love this show!!!!

0385523386|1.0|I found out about this book through a popular woman's magazine and I was so interested in it that I paid full cover price. I wish I had not. Unlike some of the other reviewers who read the book in one sitting, I have had a hard time reading this book. I find the writing rambling and unfocused. The author jumps around from topic to topic and back to topic in a stream of consciousness kind of fashion.     I am interested in reading about a woman who has had this kind of life changing experience, even if it was not a more \\"hard time\\" kind of experience. In some ways, Kerman exposes the minimum security prison's inability to provide some education and proper meals for the inmates. She illustrates the bonds that can form between women of different backgrounds that are brought together by circumstance. I believe, however, that this book would benefit from some editing and organization in the writing style. I hope I can finish it, but I will not be keeping it on my self for a re-read at a later time.
B000274THQ|4.0|It was very interesting to see how the family felt about the old regime and how the mother should not know about the fall of the wall because she was recovering from a heart attack.  It was heartwarming to see the kids go to great length to restore the apartment the way it was in the old DDR, and yes, many people just got rid of their old stuff and bought new things to start a new life.  It was touching when the mother saw the statue of Lenin \\"float\\" above her head to be discarded.  It's very worthwhile watching and my \\"East German\\" relatives felt that it was the way it was.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|The voice quality of my first recording was amazing ... very detailed and \\"in your face.\\"  My only quibble is a very subtle low-frequency hum (possibly interference) that's indiscernible until I amplified the recording with a bass-boost.  But a simple low-frequency roll-off EQ in my audio editor eliminated it.

Can't wait to see what the future holds. Luck and Love to you Diana. Bravo!!!![[ASIN:B001K3JF7K Quiet Nights]],[...]
B003EYVXVY|5.0|This movie is absolutely without a doubt the first truly 3D movie. It breaks boundaries that way that Star Wars did in it's time. The CGI is incredible and the 3D portion of the movie takes it to the next level.    The movie has a touching story that induces thoughts about the fragile nature of our Earth while evoking strong emotions regarding the characters in the film. Cameron is a true visionary and his ideas come together fluidly leaving the viewer in complete awe. This film should turn heads without 3D, but when you add the 3D aspect to it there is a clear jump into the timeless classic category.    Go buy a 3D tv, 3D Blu-Ray player, some 3D glasses and this 3D movie and you will not regret it. The required investment to start your 3D journey is considerable, but the new technology is relatively cheap in comparison to where Plasma tv's were when they were released and this certainly takes a great leap that tube television does to flat panel. This movie alone makes it worth the investment. Bow to Eywa.
B0037AGASG|3.0|First off, let me tell you that this album is not that great. After a couple of songs, the songs will start to sound all the same. There's no great (if any) variation in the songs. If you're the type of person who likes an artist to experiment with something new, do NOT buy this album. If you expect something of intelligence, don't waste your money. You won't find any intelligence here, for all of the tracks are either about looking for love, finding love, or giving love. Also, the lyrics are laughably cheesy and pretty cliched.    That being said, however boring and generic Justin Bieber's album MY WORLD 2.0 can get, it's not terrible. Bieber's voice, though it can get excessively sugary sometimes, is sweet. And he's a good singer, if not an amazing one; a refreshing alternative to those Auto-tuned \\"singers\\" that pollute the airwaves these days. Plus, the boy is only sixteen. People can't expect him to make this freaking brilliant, off-the-chain record. They will be pleased if he does, but they can't burden him with high expectations.    Though much of the album is disposable and forgettable, \\"Baby\\", my favorite song from the album, is a sweet pop confection. Though the lyrics are melodramatic (and cheesy), I can't deny that it is a pretty good song.     So, there's my review. Listen to it or discard it. I guess the chance of you liking this album depends on your taste in music.     Or, as some Justin Bieber haters would say, whether or not you even have a taste in music.
B002RT69QQ|1.0|More made in China junk.  Poorly designed, too big to clear any adjacent usb plug, flimsy and looks to last a week or two.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|Very solid album from BFMV. None of these songs bore me and I could listen to it all day!
0307408833|4.0|I am not an experienced baker, not do I have a gluten allergy. Simply put, I just love this bakery and wanted to try to recreate at home. Due to the abundance of negative reviews, I first checked out this book from my local library. I made a few desserts (the cookie sandwiches, vanilla frosting, and cupcakes). I did not have success with the frosting, but the cookies and cupcakes were fairly straight forward and simple to make. That said, I emailed the bakery about the frosting and they promptly replied with some recommendations. Then, I had success (I added more soy milk powder and oil, then pulsed in the food processor until creamy and the consistency I wanted). Then, my husband bought me the cookbook! I am thrilled to own it and bake from it quite frequently.<br /><br />My thoughts on the cookbook layout, ingredients, and recipes:<br /><br />Cookbook layout: This book is gorgeous and the layout is so fresh and fun. It's a really beautiful book, as others have noted. Make sure you read the entire book before you begin. Erin makes a lot of helpful notes throughout, as well as provides ingredient explanations and tips. Also, see the actual website for more cookbook help.<br /><br />Ingredients: Yes, the items you need are much more expensive than cheap, bleached white flour and Crisco. I eat both gluten-free and flour-based desserts and sweets, and I always buy the best ingredients available. I strongly believe in eating only the very best food, so why put something in your body that is processed, cheap, and full of additives? That said, these ingredients are not really any more pricey than non-gluten-free ingredients. The coconut oil should be virgin and can be found in small jars at Whole Foods (in fact, I found EVERYTHING I need at Whole Foods in one shopping trip). It's about $10 a jar and some recipes use the entire jar (the frosting and cookies or cupcakes) but for the most part the jar will make 3 or 4 desserts. I buy a few at a time and store it, and usually Whole Foods has their 365 brand on sale for $6.99 a jar. You must also melt the oil before use; I microwave mine in the jar and it's fine. You're also supposed to use the unscented variety, but I can't seem to find that so I just use what WF has and it's fine.<br /><br />Also, the flours get a lot of use out of them, even if they are a bit more pricey. Try to find the Bob's Red Mill large bag of the Baking Mix- it will save money and time because you will use that mix quite often. I don't have a problem with it's taste; I actually think the mix is delicious. My favorite is the spelt flour though and the entire section on scones and biscuits. Yum! Thumb through the book and make a list of all the flours needed, that way you can purchase all at once and store them in your freezer. Bob's Red Mill makes everything you will need, except the spelt of course. I use Arrowhead Mills Whole Grain Spelt and it's inexpensive. The Xanathan gum is the only pricey one (at $11 a bag at WF) but you only use a 1/4-1 teaspoon per recipe.<br /><br />Another recommendation is the get to know the ingredients before you begin. It took me a few recipes to become acclimated with the flours and oil, but now I understand how they fit into each recipe, just as I know about the purpose of flour, sugar, butter and eggs. If you are able to understand these ingredients, you will be able to make modifications when a recipe doesn't turn out as planned.<br /><br />Lastly, I use regualr sugar- the Baker's fine sugar. It works out well for me and it happens that I have a large container at home. So, I didn't spend more money on the evaporated cane juice, which is essentially the same thing (only not as processed).<br /><br />Recipes: My only negative review of this book is that a lot of the recipes don't turn out perfectly on the first try. After I made my favorites (cookies, cupcakes, scones, biscuits, cornbread, and the apple loaf) I made them a second time and they turned out much better. I had to change ingredient amounts, baking times, and pan sizes. I feel like Erin did not test her recipes in a normal kitchen with normal size pans, thus the discrepancy in the baking times. The loaves work best when made in two pans (or muffin tins) and I don't really follow her baking times because mine always take longer. However, I do think she did a great job in writing her first cookbook. I'm sure her second is bound to be better.<br /><br />Good luck to everyone. I really recommend the scones; they are easy to make and terribly delicious.<br /><br />UPDATE: I add 1/3 cup more flour to EACH of Erin's loaf recipes. For some reason, mine all fall and stay gooey despite long stays in the oven (one cooked for over an hour to no avail). So, I checked the babycakes website for cookbook help and it's noted to add more flour. I add the extra flour no matter what- I prefer a drier crumb and plumper loaf.es.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|20 bucks for Blu Ray and DVD?? sing me up! Who cares about EXTRA stuff... buy the movie...watch the movie...enjoy the movie...sounds good enough for me.
B001M3LG84|5.0|Love this dvd.  Of course I like almost all of Andre Rieu stuff.  this is probably one of his largest crowds he played for (40,000)  This is all in English expect for the songs that are written in other language and if they have singers then they sing in that lanquage.  But they also sing in english.
B00006AW2M|5.0|First of all Sgt. Pepper has never really blown my mind. Honestly, except for 'A Day in The Life' it's music hall corn and cheery psychedelia all seem pretty disposable and I never felt that it really cohered as an album despite it's peppery bookends. I may be crazy but I actually prefer this strange brew from the Stones. First of all it does what the Beatles forgot to do which is rock and while most people will at least admit to a handful of classic songs on the album they are just as quick to dismiss it as a whole. I admit, 'Sing This One All Together' (part deux) is too long but it actually serves as a nice bridge between songs and while 'In Another Land' is obviously a product of it's late sixties moment I think it's a cool little psychedelic pop nugget from Bill Wyman that turns up and rocks on the Jagger sung chorus. Otherwise, what's not to like about the rest of these songs? Critics like to claim that the Stones were never an album band like the Beatles but to my ear the opposite is true and I don't think that this album is an exception. Even with it's Mick and the boys in wizards hats cover art and title pertaining to lucifer's lunch order it is in my view an overlooked classic. But hey, if you don't like it you can move on to 'Beggar's Banquet' and if you don't like that, well...Ricky Martin might be coming out with a new album before you know it.
B000002NJM|4.0|I am not quite sure how this unfolded: in the 1970s, Pam Grier made a film called [[ASIN:B000053VBA Foxy Brown]], which had a great soundtrack featuring the great Babara Mason.<br /><br />Well, if you are going to create blaxploitation thirty years after the fact, no one can like Quintin Tarentino. Even if you watch films like Pulp Fiction, those 1970s references are packed in, more so than in the films of the era. He is obviously a student of the blowout afro and bell bottom<br /><br />And it is this richness of detail that comes with the Jackie Brown soundtrack. Most directors would soup up the theme from Shaft, make some 1990s disco parody cheese, and release a forgettable score that made you realize said film maker has a cartoon notion of the Me Decade-have disco blaring in a film set in 1972, or choose the standard soul classics<br /><br />But Tarentino goes down the middle with lesser known tracks by singers like Bill Withers and Bobby Womack. This stuff was all over AM radio too--it just never made it to the oldies hit parade.<br /><br />Educated, smart, this soundtrack may not run neck and neck with the great 1970s scores, but for its research and taste, this is far above average\.
0393051587|5.0|If you enjoy learning about the life of Charles Dickens, and how Christmas Carol came to be written,  if you might enjoy the history of great literature,  this book does all that.  It is not dry, but it is very complete.  You can read just the introductory chapters to get the background,  your can read or not the detailed footnotes, you can read just the story and the footnotes, you can look at the beautiful monographs, take your pick, it is all there.  Not too academic for the general reader.  Besides, it will push you to live a better life...
0451205766|3.0|In most cases a book is better than a movie based on it- but the there are exceptions, and the 'Godfather' is one of them. In this case it is not that the book is bad- it is actually quite enjoyable- but 'The Godfather' is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.   The movie is very true to the plot of the book, but I was also struck by how much dialogue in the movie is straight out of the book. That is the real strength of the book: the dialogue. The other facets of Puzo's writing are not as strong. The story loses focus and momentum with the Johnny Fontane subplot, but overall is a good read.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The producers had a chance to capture some of the magic of the original series but--alas--they missed the boat. The appearance of Leonard Nimoy is one of the few bright spots. Spock French-kissing Uhura is undoubtedly the film's nadir; that, and the discombobulated script with its unbridled excesses and the constant cops-and-robbers-style shootouts make this movie suitable for puerile audiences and, perhaps, video game lovers.
0061474339|4.0|'Abhorsen' by Garth Nix picks right where 'Lirael' leaves off -it is really part two of the same story, so be sure to read 'Lirael' first. It is an excellent conclusion to the story. It also answers a number of questions about the history of the old kingdom,including the nature of Moggett and the Disreputable Dog. Just an excellent series.
B000PMFS2I|1.0|A beautiful drifter (Elizabeth Berkeley) blows into Las Vegas and finds success as the understudy of a big time stripper (Gina Gershon).  But at what cost?    This film has long had the reputation of being one of the all-time Hollywood turkeys, and I must say that for once a film has lived up to its hype.  \\"Showgirls\\" is such a naked look into the retarded sexuality of screenwriter Joe Ezsterhas and director Paul Verhoeven that it would have made Freud blush.  It is, however, good for several unintended laughs.  You can definitely enjoy this if you're in the right frame of mind and don't harbor any unrealistic expectations--such as seeing a halfway decent movie.
B000WGD180|5.0|Hello There  I am a HUGH Fan of all musicals all over, and after playing the Notre Dame de Paris in my own country (Denmark), I loved the musical more and more. So when I was told to wacth the original french version, I di´d whatever I could to find it, and then I discovered that it was on sale here on Amazon.com I was TOTAL-HAPPY!  I didn't think much of the price, I kept thinking how happy I would be, to have the movie myself, so I truely could enjoy the Spectacle!   I thought I had to wait a mounth or more for its arrival, But I only waited for 10 DAYS!!!!  HAPPY-ME! OVERJOIED!  Thanks to Amazon.com. This has turned my life SO MUCH, because I can't wacth anything else eversince.
B0030IIYWA|4.0|This is a really great movie with the exception of one thing.  That God awful voice of Randy Newman!  I am always baffled how a man who sings as if he has crapped in weeks get so much work!(???) Nails on a chalkboard folks!  I wish Lasseter would stop using this chump!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|After seeing Robert Downey, Jr. handcuffed naked to a bed in the trailer, I swore I'd never watch this movie.  But sitting on my 3rd 8 hour plus flight in a week, and seeing glimpses of the movie on the other passengers' screens over and over again caused me to give it a try.  It turned out to be diverting.  The characters were definitely not as I had seen them portrayed before, though I was more prepared for the portrayal of Watson, whom I knew to be a former military officer, than that of Holmes.  But I can't say the character portrayals were unfamiliar - watching Holmes and Watson was like watching House and Wilson on an episode of House, MD.
B000ERU6QC|5.0|Let me start off by saying I have every CD in the QOTSA catalog and have played them adnauseum. I'm a fan to say the least. Them Crooked Vultures, big fan as well. For some stupid reason, had overlooked the EODM. I bought Death By Sexy not really expecting a lot given the small and sometimes mixed reviews. I am so glad I picked it up!    Basically you pop this in your cd player (remember those?) and this disc rocks you to your core from track 1 to track 13. It's just such a feel good rock out air guitar, air drum, air everything type of deal where you just can't sit still and listen to it, or atleast I can't. I'm hooked on EODM now.     I seriously think Josh Homme can do no wrong at this point.    I'm sitting on 1000+ CDs and buying more all the time. I need to catch up with some other new stuff I've bought recently but I can't keep playing this CD!!!    I'm picking up the other 2 EODM albums asap, and probably the DVD as well. I recommend this CD to the point that I wrote this review and have never bothered to do so for any other CD.    :)
B002XTBE8I|3.0|People who listen to and like Eminem noticed when he essentially vanished for three years. So when Relapse came out, with a promise of Relaspe 2, I was intrigued. It is definitely a different Eminem. Oh, same style, but you can hear that he's grown in \\"Beautiful\\" \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Careful What You Wish For\\" more fine weather fans will hear the Eminem they are used to in tracks like \\"We Made You\\" and \\"3 Am\\" \\"Bagpipes from Baghdad\\" is in that vein, but it seems a bit like his first few discs. recorded simply to be mean not to tell a story. All in all, if you like Eminem's past records, pick this up. You won't be disappointed. And if you like some of his older songs but kind of want new, more mature stuff? Pick it up as well. You will like a few of them
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Listened to a couple of songs and was convinced that it did not compare to \\"Phantom\\". Then, I played it from beginning to end and cannot stop humming the songs EVERYWHERE I GO!!!! You can understand the entire story from listening to the soundtrack and I can only hope that the play is as beautiful. Could I like this one better than the original Phantom? It's looking that way!!!
B003ELNV9Y|3.0|Just to tell you, I liked Jeff Beck just a little more than Eric Clapton. And Jeff Beck's new album is pretty top-notch. He's got this singer I've never heard of before, Joss Stone, singing on some of the tracks (the notable one being a cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \\"I Put a Spell on You\\"). He also got opera singer Olivia Safe on the vocals for another cool track, \\"Elegy for Dunkirk.\\" As usual, Jeff Beck shows off his axe talents and really makes this a cool album. And most of the songs remind me of Jeff Beck's early works, whether it's with the Yardbirds, the Jeff Beck Group, or even his solo work.    The only thing is the Imelda May track. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It just doesn't rock that much.    But Jeff Beck has made a great album. And he's kept making great music for 45 years.
B0014YVCDK|3.0|Its not there best work but worth buying if you get it for less then 10
B0039OGGVQ|3.0|I've loved Slash from the beginning! Right from 1987 to Velvet Revolver to his new solo album featuring other awesome rock icons singing vocals on his tracks, which are all greatly done!    My personal favorites are \\"By the Sword,\\" \\"Beautiful Dangerous,\\" \\"Gotten,\\" \\"Crucify the Dead,\\" \\"Doctor Alibi,\\" \\"We're All Gonna Die,\\" and \\"Watch This.\\"    Honestly, Slash is a great guitarist. But sometimes it falls flat. I thought it was a good idea to get Fergie in on \\"Beautiful Dangerous.\\" But I don't know why, honestly. She has a good voice and she's a nice piece of BLEEP.    My least favorite tracks are \\"Promise,\\" \\"Saint Is a Sinner Too,\\" and \\"I Hold On.\\" It just doesn't work.    Overall, this is a good album. Like the title says, \\"Slash is back!\\"
B0030T1NAO|5.0|The show is outstanding but if you don't like Breaking Bad, why would you be buying this.  The Blu Ray video is good as is the sound.  With all Blu Ray, I wish they provided better extras then that of the dvd.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I was excited when I received the Avatar movie but was disapointed when I saw that it came with 2 DVDs (0ne normal DVD and the other BLueRay) but there is no Special Features (I love looking at the special features, deleted scenes, director and actors comments, etc)    I totally agree with By  M. Western \\"MYD Movie Fan and By  M. Stephenson reviews.    But on cool thing to check it out if you have a DVD player and a BLue Ray and a HD TV check out  the HUGE difference in picture quality between the 2 DVDs it is night and day.    For any DVD and BLueRay distributor that reads this. Special Features should ALWAYS BE part of ANY MOVIE Released on DVD and Blue Ray. ALWAYS !!!!    IF the Avatar Ultimate Edition is coming out in NOvember (and that is why FOX hold back not giving on this one the Extra bonus) the correct way would be to have added the Special features in this release of the Avatar and on the Ultimate Edition you would have the 3D version Option and additional Behind the Scenes features maybe some extra special programs on the Making of Avatar that I saw on TV. Or Even a Director's CUT version of the movie that would be AWESOME !!! In this scenario Everybody Wins (Fox and us) !!!!    Neokanobi

0553381407|5.0|I read the book at the beginning of my journey to myself, when I \\"broke up\\" with my father and was going through the greatest crisis of my life. As a once \\"perfect child\\" who was always obsessed with keeping the harmony and doing everything that was expected of her, I was devastated, desperate, insecure, the world as I knew it was crumbling down on me and I am so thankful that I found this book, which helped me understand so many things going on with me. The most important thing that I remember is that - before I discovered Alice Miller, who helped me even more - Susan Forward was the first author to say directly: \\"You don't have to forgive your parents for what they did to you, in order to heal.\\" It was exactly what I needed to go on with my discovery of my personal truth, with my therapy...  An essential book for everybody who is at the beginning of this journey, which always begins by a crisis (job loss, divorce, big fight with the parents, break up with the parents, death of a parent etc.). Good to have somebody reassure you that there is nothing wrong with you, that you have been the victim of toxic parents and that you now have the chance (and the obligation, for that matter!!) to change this.  Good luck to all the adult children, abused children and everybody else who has the courage to go further on this road!!

0393072231|4.0|The \\"Big Short\\" is a fast-paced account focusing on a few traders leading up to the financial meltdown of 2008.  It is a riveting, page-turner that I read in one sitting.  As thoughtful entertainment, it completely succeeds.<br /><br />Using the stories of a few traders makes an excellent way to grip the reader and illustrate the causes of the meltdown.  Since Lewis is a superb writer, he manages to make the murky world of CDO's and CDS's relatively understandable - and if not transparent at least make visible the reasons for their opacity.  Many of the larger causes and issues with the current financial system get mentioned in passing in this book, but the \\"big picture\\" is never presented.<br /><br />In the last chapter Lewis brings the story back to his thesis that the root cause lies in the banking houses having gone public.  This is as \\"macro\\" as he gets.  However, this is a disappointing and simplified analysis.  In my view, too many companies going public has been bad for the economy, because their focus becomes too short-term.  However, this is part of a bigger piece.  As a society we've been engaged in mass wishful thinking fostered by economists and politicians that the magical market will always correct itself without government intervention.  We dismantled our regulatory framework and allowed a few greedy people to loot our wealth.  This is not just limited to banking, but pervades the economy.  We've allowed wealth to concentrate in the hands of a few individuals to the harm of the rest of us.  Our politicians have used the rhetoric of \\"freedom\\" to persuade people to vote against their own economic self-interest.<br /><br />The Big Short is well worth reading and a good way to get an understanding of the financial instruments involved in the crisis for those who cannot or will not understand arcane details of finance.  From the microeconomic perspective of the subprime meltdown, it is very informative.  However, this book provides no meaningful macroeconomic or political perspective.pective.
1400052173|5.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" by Rebecca Skloot is a tough book to classify.  While it covers issues of science and cultural studies, at its heart it is the simple story of a family trying to find out who their mother truly was and why for so long they never knew about the contribution she made to science.  Skloot has a lot of disparate territory to cover in this book, including dense scientific material, but she manages with great aplomb to make \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" a story that is easy to understand for non-scientific folks without losing the incredibly moving aspects concerning the Lacks family.  It is a book that is hard to put down and even harder to forget.<br /><br />In 1951, Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer; before and after her death, doctors removed cancerous cells from her tumor-riddled body to experiment upon.  Unlike other cells that had been experimented on, Henrietta's cells were immortal - they could reproduce endlessly.  Known forever after as HeLa cells, experiments using these cells led to advancements in cancer treatments, various drugs and tests, and the Salk polio vaccine.  Yet for twenty years, her family never knew anything about the work that was being done with Henrietta's cells, and, needless to say, their world was turned upside down when they found out.  Most of her five children, if not all, lived in virtual poverty with a wide array of medical problems, unable to afford treatment and unable to understand even the basic scientific information necessary to understand what was happening with their \\"mother cells\\".<br /><br />Angry that millions had been made from HeLa cells, some family members wanted to sue Johns Hopkins to get money they thought they richly deserved; other members were happy to receive recognition of who HeLa really was.  After years of frustration and a wily con-artist, the Lacks family was hesitant to allow Skloot to research the issue.  But Skloot was different because she didn't want to know just about the cells - she wanted to know about the woman behind them, and in this book she has paid the greatest recognition that others before her, the doctors and scientists, have never paid.<br /><br />\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" tells many stories, some that are extremely hard to fathom in the present day, yet times were different in the 1950s.  There was still segregation and health care for poor blacks often led to unethical experimentation (like the Tuskeegee syphilis experiment).  Skloot traces the history of cell culture, including the infamous \\"immortal chicken heart\\" and the later problems of contamination caused by HeLa cells.  Her scientific research is thorough and impeccable and entirely easy to understand.  She raises tough ethical questions and explores the pressing issue of whether or not tissue experimentation can be classified as experimentation upon human beings.  It is amazing to think of all the scientific advancements that have been made because of one woman's cells.  \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is an incredible story, one that justly deals with its subject but also delivers justice to a long-suffering family.about the cells - she wanted to know about the woman behind them, and in this book she has paid the greatest recognition that others before her, the doctors and scientists, have never paid.    \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" tells many stories, some that are extremely hard to fathom in the present day, yet times were different in the 1950s.

B000N6TX22|4.0|Without telling the story line, it is worth watching.  The settings are nice to look at, and the actors are believable.  We are always looking for movies, books, or games with a good story, but, we find ourselves playing, reading, or watching some of the same ones more than once, due to the lack of new ones.  This would compare to Thee Road, The book of Eli, Star gate, matrix, etc.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX22/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B001VLBDD0|3.0|I just recently re-watched TERMINATOR 2:JUDGMENT DAY (1991) to try to get some understanding as to why SO MANY movie fans think that it is the best of the Terminator films and having seen it, it is worse than I thought! I was sure that I would at least think T2 was good enough to rate closely to it's predecessor T1 and boy was I mistaken! I first saw T2 back in the early 90s and it really didn't blow me away even back then. But that was more due to the fact that I had suffered sequel overload during that time (DIE HARD 2 and LETHAL WEAPON 2 being the main culprits, both of which I loved at the time and can't stand now!), but also that I was more into Arnold Schwarzenegger movies (three Arnie action classics PREDATOR-1987, RUNNING MAN-1988, and TOTAL RECALL-1990 had just come out) than I was into Terminator movies. I just wanted to see an Arnie action film! I know the Terminator is supposedly different from the typical Arnie flick, but I wasn't fully aware of this at the time. In retrospect, I understand better what the Terminator films encompass.    With T2, I kind of got an Arnie action film, but not really; it's more of a James Cameron film, which for me, is not really a good thing. I think Cameron is perhaps the most overrated director in modern film history! In T2, Arnie's T800 is really only a nominal (although above the title credits) character; and plays 2nd fiddle to Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton, who overemotes mightily in this) and 10-year old John Connor (an annoying Edward Furlong) and acts as their protector from the T1000. Robert Patrick plays the T1000, whose liquid metal configuration is a cool (if unbelievable) creation. Patrick is actually pretty good in his limited screen time and definitely exudes menace, but the fear of his character is derived more from his seemingly invincible design (backed up by some incredible, groundbreaking CGI) than the actor himself. In T1, we saw Schwarzenegger's T800 bit by bit lose his \\"humanity\\" to reveal the creature underneath (with the aid of puppetry and stop-motion animation) and that was a lot scarier.    The T2 supporting cast ranges from very weak (John's foster parents, who weren't even REMOTELY curious as to why a huge German-accented leather-clad biker was looking for John!) to inconsequential (Sarah's Mexican friend that helped hide them out), but not all their fault as they aren't operating with much of a script. Also, I found myself cringing at certain scenes, and for the wrong reasons! A major example would be the poorly executed (no pun intended) \\"key\\" scene when the heroic trio go after the T800 creator Dyson: When Arnie's T800 strips off the human skin on his robotic arm to prove their story to Dyson, the bug-eyed reactions of Dyson and his wife were way over-the-top. But the worst part of that scene was Sarah's overly melodramatic crisis of conscience about killing Dyson; Hamilton's acting during that scene was really bad. Contrast an ineffectual manipulative \\"Hollywood\\" scene like this one to the more \\"naturalistic\\" character reactions in T1, which wasn't made with some studio bigwigs getting in the way of the director's vision. Also, I thought the whole Dyson subplot to be kind of tacked on.    Arnie's one-liners (which shouldn't even really exist in a movie like this) come off as mostly stale due to a painfully weak, by-the-numbers script. I couldn't believe how poor the dialogue was when I saw this again recently! Not really even an attempt at realism or humor. The dialogue serves as filler material to either try to be cute with silly catchphrases (and dated ones at that) or to pontificate unnecessarily about nuclear war and the fate of humanity. T1 didn't have such waste in it, cutting to the chase (literally) and even the expository dialogue and scenes were PART OF the action, rather than being separate from it like in T2.    James Cameron is not really one of my favorite directors (although I think T1 is perhaps the best sci-fi action film ofall time), but he did a tremendous job of helping to usher in a new era of special effects with T2 (major reason why I'm at least giving it 3 stars!). The 20-year old effects are still very eye-catching indeed and top even a lot of the current CGI in movies now. But the main problem with the effects is, as previously alluded to, with the logic behind the makeup Patrick's T1000 character. Are we supposed to accept at face value that such an unlikely creation from the not-so-distant future is even possible? Yeah, it's cool, but it's there as simply an excuse for action and to wow us with advanced effects, whereas in T1, Arnie's T800 was an actual CHARACTER! When it comes to CGI vs. character, give me character anyday!
B0018QCXGY|5.0|If you want to watch a film with some of the best CGs you've seen, then this will be a great film; it's one of my favorites and I have watched and read sci-fi and horror for at least 35 years of my life.  If you want to watch one where you need to analyze the meaning and characters and how they affect today's society etc. etc. then you may not like it.  Just watch the film and enjoy it.  Coming from, yours truly, a nerd, don't be a nerd and tear apart the film.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I found Food, Inc. to be a very informative and eye-opening film.  Most Americans probably don't have any idea who is producing their food, the conditions that it's produced in, and who really has control over the food industry as a whole.    I enjoyed this film also because it's very thought-provoking without being sensational(when I think sensational, I think of Michael Moore).  It lays out the facts and doesn't seem like some kind of weird conspiracy theory.  Some people have suggested in their reviews that this film has a leftist slant - I personally didn't find this to be the case.  I would think that regardless of a person's political affiliations, they would be interested in knowing about the origins of what they put in their body.  I really can't see this as being a democrat/republican issue - it's a human issue.   I highly recommend this movie to anybody interested in the well-being of our planet and their own health.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I saw the live show and just had to have the CD to listen to their fabulous melodic voices again.  These 4 ladies have beautiful voices that only a live concert can project and celebrate but the CD is spot on.  If you've never been to one of their concerts, then by all means, buy this CD so you can envision and experience what it was all about.  If you have been lucky enough to attend their concert, then this CD will put you right back into your seat looking at the stage reliving the show.  It's pure joy and great entertainment and they are second to none.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|My title is two-fold, because not only do I think 1984's THE TERMINATOR (T1) is the best and undisputed of all the Terminator movies, I also think it's the best and undisputed of James Cameron's films! I really think that after this original classic, Cameron totally lost his ability to tell a solid story and got too caught up in special effects extravaganzas. Don't believe me? Then watch (I mean really WATCH!) the first sequel to T1, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (T2). It has fantastic effects, but ZERO character development or story! It is the template for the typical, mindless summer action movies that come out in drones in today's CGI-laden film world. The characters in T2 are one-dimensional throughout and the dialogue in that movie is inane and borders on atrocious! Cameron got it right with T1.    T1 is an superb amalgamation of several genres working in perfect synergy: science fiction, horror, action, love story, AND speculation! And all this happens in an amazingly short running time, but the film doesn't feel incomplete (T2 is twice as long and feels totally incomplete!). Quite simply, T1 has \\"no fat\\" on it. Everything seems necessary to propel the plot along.     Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is a wonder to behold to this day! I still don't think enough people appreciate how great it truly is. He is totally convincing as a machine, and nothing to do with the fact that he is an actor of limited range (ok, maybe that's part of it!). But imagine how hard it must be to literally be \\"emotionless\\", but to react not as a human would, but as a programmed machine would, and he pulled it off. Most other actors that play robots (including the ones in the sequels) tend to play it the same in an all-too obvious, monotone manner, and aren't able to hide human characteristics.     The other two main performances should not be overlooked either. Both Michael Biehn (as futuristic rebel soldier Kyle Reese) and Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor future mother of resistanceleader John Connor) deliver knockout performances as well. The actors really \\"sell\\" the movie and lift it to a higher level than lesser or miscast actors would have.     T1's main draw is it's claustropobic, unsettling, atmospheric, noirish tone and feel throughout, thanks in large part to the memorable beating, bouncing score that accompanies the Terminator whenever he shows up. The film's first big set piece is at the aptly named Tech Noir dance club and that scene signifies the entire mood of T1. Then the iconic \\"I'll be back\\" police station showdown puts the icing on the cake! Set mostly at night, the underlying theme of T1 is doom, dread, and hopelessness, yet the film never bores as it moves at a fast pace, has gritty dialogue, strong characters, and a pulse-pounding climax.     The undisputed, original king of the action, sci-fi genre!
B00371QQ0M|3.0|This is a \\"nothing special\\" blu-ray release of the film. Its the theaterical cut. They didn't spend much effort on visual improvement and the extras are completely lacking. You can tell they cared because they didn't even spring for Disc art. The biggest improvement is in the sound. Its sounds good (like a Blu-ray should).    The BD-Live features are a showcase in how not to do BD-Live features. They are extremely annoying.     As to the film, its a mixed bag. Its what happens when a project gets out of control. The script was flawed, the budget for the production was not properly managed and there was no way at the end to put it together in a way that makes a great film. There are some books that just don't adapt well to the film format and this is one of them. Fans of the books will mostly like it. Those who have not read the book will be lost as to whats going on.    But for all its flaws, its the one of the better \\"De Laurentiis\\" films in this genre.

B00004YRQA|5.0|Though the high price point and limited space are something of a burden,the OFFICIAL Sony PS2 memory card is a reliable product. However, ALL NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR THE BOOTLEGS ON HERE.    Here are some things I would say to examine to make sure you have a legitimate memory card.    BEFORE BUYING THE CARD  - Beware of very low prices. I would personally be suspicious of anything lower than $10.00.    - Try to ask the seller if the card you are thinking of buying from them is made in Japan. Legitimate cards are without a doubt made in Japan, so you should be   wary if they mention any place other than Japan.    - Try to read some of the negative feedback the seller has received. If you see even ONE buyer that hints that they got a questionable card, be on the defensive...    - If there's a product description entered for the card on the prices page, read it VERY carefully. Though a seller may state the card is \\"real\\", it doesn't mean it's an OFFICIAL product.  *Example of a suspect listing:  BRAND NEW CARD!! REAL!!!! BUY NOW!!!!    The listing says the card is \\"REAL\\" but it doesn't state the card is an \\"OFFICIAL\\" Sony memory card.    ************************************    IF YOU'VE ALREADY BOUGHT AND RECEIVED A CARD, DON'T OPEN IT YET!!!!! There's a few ways to tell you're dealing with an illegitimate card before you even open the package.    - Look over the packaging and see if the card was made ANYWHERE else other than Japan. If you see it was made in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or any other place, it may very well be a fake.    - Read EVERY WORD on the packaging that you can. This includes ALL the precautions and instructions on the back and front of the packaging. Much like a lot of unprofessional things, a spelling error is the number one clue of something low class. Even ONE spelling error is grounds for suspicion in my book...    - Look for sentences or words on the packaging that are either spaced to close or too far from each other. With a fake card that I got, there were many sentences that seemed to be written fine from afar. However, when you looked closer, the sentences had strangely high amounts of space in between them. Think of it as someone writing a sentence with an inch of space between each word....    - Look at the font of the words on the packaging. The sentences on an official card's packaging have a very crisp and clean looking font to them. However, with the card I got, the font was really ugly and cheap looking.    - Look for writing on the front of the packaging that tells you the color of the card. In the top left hand corner, there is black writing with a white background that tells you the color of the card on an official package.    - If you have one on hand, try to compare the front of the card you received with an official Sony PS2 memory card. When I compared my official cards with the fake I received, I saw that the fake had the words \\"Magicgate\\" printed very sloppily on it. That is, the words were curving upwards when they should've been perfectly straight. Think of it as how it looks when one tries to write a straight sentence on paper that doesn't have lines.    - Try to get a feel for the quality of plastic used to make the card. A card I received looked to be made out of very cheap plastic and I practically had to snap it back together since it was splitting apart.    ********************************************************    IF YOU'VE ALREADY OPENED THE PACKAGE AND ARE WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A FAKE  - Look to see if the card has varying amounts of free space on it. I've read that some cards have varying space even if nothing is saved on them.    - Pay attention to any games having a hard time saving to the card. Saving or loading data to and from the card may take long periods of time. In addition, you may encounter frequent bouts of corrupted data.    ******************************************************    There's likely many more signs of fake cards out there, but I think this is a good start of things to look for. Always make sure to take as many precautions when buying these cards as you can. The annoyance of a dysfunctional product is simply not worth the low price you may pay for it....
B002VECM6S|5.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" touched many hearts as it came into theaters this past Christmas.  The love of one family went a long way.  This movie grabs a hold of the viewer's emotions and gets them thinking about their own \\"random acts of kindness\\".  In the story, Michael Oher, a homeless, heavy-set, black teenager is shown more love than he's ever imagined. The white middle/upper class family Tuohy, feels pity on him and gives him a good meal and a warm bed for the night.  Well they end up extending his visit because they feel that he needs them.  The mother is the \\"head\\" of the family and spends time, money, and energy to help Michael fulfill his potential.  She pulles him out of the broken home that he came from, provides for him and treats him like her own son. She gives him is own room and his own bed, which he never had in his life.She hires a personal tutor to help him suceed in high school.  She gets him interested in going to college. She and her son train him to become a better football player She manages all the offers from universities who all want him on their football teams. She helps him get his drivers liscenc and a car to drive.  She restores hope  and value back into his life.  She sometimes is unsure of the actions she is doing for Michael, but she does them out of love. She is the hero.  The rest of the family, also shows the same love and acceptance as they start the adoption process.  The only people who don't understand is the family's friends and neighbors.  This idea of showing love is confusing to them.  They conclude that they are adopting him for one reason, to get money out of his career of being a famous football player.  The mother stands up for Michael and wants him to succeed no matter how different he is or where he came from.   The audience is pulled to the idea of \\"random acts of kindness\\" and the love that the mother in the film showed Michael.  The cast and crew did a fabulous job!  It is one of my favorite movies now.  I particularly love that they say they are a Christian family are are portrayed as a good Christian family.  It means that there is still some hope that movies can still bring that message to people.
B00009NHC5|4.0|But not in a bad way. It's actually a compliment to the people who wrote the movie. Good job! This thriller puts you in the story of Susy Hendrix, a women who is blinded in a recent car crash and now lives with the pressure of her husband to become the \\"world's champion blind lady\\". Susy is constantly terrorized by her neighbor, Gloria, who is battling insecurities of her own. But, the two realize, that in the end they will both need each others help to fight off the trouble they soon find themselves in.         I highly reccommend this movie. The plot is interesting, and certain aspects of the film definitely make it more exciting to watch.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|Death Proof is one of those movies that you either get, or you don't. You either  hate it for its lengthy dialogue and slow pace, or you love it for its wit and over the top action sequences.     A classic Tarantino movie, it contains all your basics: Snappy dialogue, film references galore, an amazing soundtrack, and sexy women. I won't bother boring you with a plot summary because I'm sure you already know what this is about, so I will just jump right in.     The acting in this movie, in my opinion, is top notch. Those who stand out include Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Tamilla Poitier, and Tracie Thoms. These women are riotously funny, and each take their respective roles and run with them. Kurt Russell plays your generic creeper, and of course the amazing Rose McGowen shines in her cameo.     As far as action is concerned, this movie makes you pay your dues before you can get the good stuff. Unlike your usual James Bond flick, where the actions comes to you, this film builds up to it, and when you finally get to the action, it is mind blowing. The final twenty minutes of the movie are completely stunning and satisfying.    Overall, this movie is one that you will have to learn to like, and if its not your cup of tea, then you will hate it forever.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Fantastic movie! Robert Downey is a superb actor and he really showed his cunning and agility in this  movie. I like his vision of the celebrated Sherlock Holmes. He showed movies can be fun without the weighing down of conventions or stereotypes. Many people who watch movies disect them to death during and after watching them. Reminds me of my first Literature class in College. I think that if in your mind you are looking for a good time and some fun and some misdirection, then you will be watching the right movie when you see this flick.

From 1992-1995, corporate vice president Marc Whitacre (Damon) wore a FBI wire and blew the whistle on corn processor Archer-Daniels-Midland for conspiring - on a global scale - to fix prices. That's the short story. The longer one reveals remarkable duplicity - you almost have to admire it - in which the crime Whitacre commits (and the egomania he embraces to hide it) almost surpasses, you know, global price fixing. He lies to his long-suffering wife Ginger (Melanie Lynsky), the two FBI agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) who vouch for his undercover work, judges, lawyers, TV hosts, journalists, parents, doctors and, good measure, himself.     In part because two different books written about the ADM scandal arrive at different conclusions, \\"The Informant!\\" hedges on just why Whitacre lied and what ADMknew. Scott Burns' literate script is dense with locations, depositions and negotiations. It's subtle, too, in how it sows a single clue in one scene, only to have it bloom later into a lush, devastating fiction.     But Soderbergh treats it like a game show, a joke, a funhouse mirror, burying the story underneath Marvin Hamlisch's frolicky musical score and a high-contrast look that washes out the edges of the frame and turns everyone's face beet red. The narration - about bugs, polar bears, Tokyo, chicken legs and any other number of topics - is initially clever. Then strange and unlikely - especially the Tokyo comment. Then pure conceit, a trinket rolling around on a countertop.     Damon imbues Whitacre with a sort of detached hubris, as if the exec is watching himself inside a movie, choosing to deepen the plot rather than simplify his life. Some of Whitacre's choices appear inexplicable except when viewed through the prism of inviting trouble for the thrill of it. Soderbergh's direction works against the performance, but Damon is just as squirmy, treacherous and weird here as he was in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\\" Bakula is an odd choice for the lead FBI agent, while McHale, a comedian who hosts \\"The Soup,\\" is badly miscast as the other.     \\"The Informant!\\" chooses tone over theme, and thus the rage of the story - perfectly well-to-do men insisting, through extraordinary corruption, they must do better at the expense of others - is lost amidst the distractions Soderbergh creates.
B000002TWN|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever. I remember enjoying the smooth melodies as a kid, but you need to get a little older to really feel every aspect of the cd, especially the lyrics. This is one of those albums where not only can you listen to every song in it's entirety but you can feel each track taking you through different emotions. The album is R&B, with a jazzy vibe to it. It effortlessly fuses classic soul with a contemporary 90s sound; the flow on the lyrics sometimes have a hip-hop vibe to them. Really, it's timeless. I was shocked to read the credits and realize that he not only sang, but also wrote, arranged, and produced this masterpiece. Hope he makes more music in the future.

0375413405|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie!  I am/was a terrible cook; however, Mastering the Art of French Cooking is a teaching book.....and, I have made several of the recipes in this book and I love them all!  I've learned how to hold a knife and how to slice vegetables and meats!  I've learned the importance of proper cookware and how to care for it!  My favorite recipes, so far, are the scalloped potatoes and the chocolate Queen Sheba Cake!  These recipes, some easy some not, are as good as anything I have ever tasted!  Also, the pan-broiled steak with sauce are simple to make and \\"out-of-this-world\\" delicious!  In fact, the recipes made according to her guidelines are so good when served.....I wanted to finish the meal by \\"LICKING THE PLATE!\\"  Thank you Julia!
B002ZG977Y|2.0|There's a whole slew of computer-generated creatures in this remake, but the most stunning visual is Gemma Arterton, a one-time Bond Girl whose eyes glint and puddle up as Io, the muse and demigoddess guide to Perseus (Sam Worthington) in this well-worn tale of Greek mythology. No surprises in this 90-minute quickie, aside from an awful turn as Hades from Ralph Fiennes, who appears to have swallowed a pill of Insta-Queeze, which is quite different from underworld menace.     Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), is a terribly grim sort, having lost his family in the war between men and gods. Reluctantly but without mercy, he slays a variety of beasts, chats up Io and eventually wins a showdown inside Medusa's lair with the help of a scorpion shield. Then it's on to the Kraken, which the audience never quite sees in full before it's turned to stone.     Worthington appears headed for a lifetime of cop and soldier-of-fortune roles, while Arterton - with another upcoming starring role in Jerry Bruckheimer's beefcake epic \\"Prince of Persia\\" - is headed for the A-list. A British accent, toothy grin and hair that looks great thrown into ancient Scrunchies? I smell the second coming of Rachel Weisz.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie I have to say is amazing. It is one of my most favorite movies of all time. It is so pointless and weird that it make you laugh. This edition is amazing and is deffinatly worth the money. The guys of Monty Python will always be known for great comedy. And this movie will be know as their Holy Grail. WARNING I have to say something if you are a person who does not like comedy, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. If you like comedys, but like a well understandible plot and story line, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. If you think movies like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstin, Airplane, are the dumbest movies that ever existed, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. So if you are one of the people who agrees with every thing I just said, don't waist your money you will not like it. But if you disagree with all the things that I mentioned above, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. This movie makes no sense and it is not suppose to that is the point. This movie stupid, wrong, vile, offensive, pointless, low budget and I loved every minute of it.

B000UOGHKS|5.0|Possibly the most famous woman in recorded music takes center stage. She shuffles the deck even further and etches out a new persona, Dita on the S & M title song. You enter a world with an urban-edge feel that packs as much punch as 1967's \\"Velvet Underground & Nico\\". Just like on that album domination, experimentation, self-destruction, love and death are the predominate themes here.<br /><br />Musically, there's a seductive flow between techno-dance tracks and gripping balladry. I count at least three classic ballads. \\"Where Life Begins\\" is ear-candy dripping against a jazz-pop background. Her suggestive voice is well-suited to this setting and she tosses in a great metaphor. With \\"Rain\\" comes a lyrically mature view on unrequited love accompanied with a sweet melody to boot. And on the undeniably catchy \\"Bad Girl\\" comes a powerful warning of taking the wrong paths in life. This is as chilling a chronicle of wastedness as Steely Dan's \\"Charlie Freak\\" or Neil Young's \\"Borrowed Tune\\".<br /><br />As for the danceable pieces, I hear four that attain classic status. Techno has never sounded more irresistable than on \\"Words\\" and lyrically it warns (that word again) how words can slice. \\"Thief of Hearts\\" is pure and nasty street vengeance. Not pretty at all. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is sung through a telephone saying to the rejected party that this lousy relationship is once-and-for-all finished. Then there's one of the greatest party anthems ever, \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", a dance-club masterpiece that caters to the alternative mindset.<br /><br />This album just may be a weekend conversation with Dita in an intimate gathering for two (or more) with the subject matter being an amalgamation of love good and bad. Like an underground novel, complexity dominates. The hand of pleasure rules with sustained wisdom. This is her magnum opus. Eternally playable.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|It's almost indecent, in the wake of discovering the next great actor, Carey Mulligan, to suggest the movie that will serve as her springboard, \\"An Edcuation\\" is a flirt at best and a bit of a flimsy lark at worst. Well, it is, and that's OK, because where the film fudges, it does so in deference to Mulligan, whose work serves as the best female performance of the year, and just short of Christoph Waltz for both the genders. She is too good for the film, saving it and consigning it to mediocrity.     Closely based on British journalist Lynn Barber's sharp, simple memoir - with a couple key, unfortunate differences - \\"An Education\\" is set in 1961 London and features Mulligan as 16-year-old Jenny, a private schoolgirl with working class parents (Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour) and two eyes (plus their four) on Oxford. She's walking home one rainy afternoon when a thirtysomething chap named David (Peter Sarsgaard) pulls over his Bristol and offers a ride. He's witty about it, he seems cultured, and he appears to mean little harm. Jenny gets in. David warms up. Not long after, he's taking her out for supper with his two friends, Danny (Dominic Cooper) and Helen (Rosamund Pike).     In short time, David reveals to Jenny \\"the world,\\" - restaurants, jazz clubs, foreign films, sex - and Jenny happily indulges. In fact, at 16 (and then 17) she appears more at ease in the world than David does. And yet she's charmed by him. So are her willfully-blind parents. David's other, less flattering shoe will drop, of course - though not by his choosing.     Mulligan radiates warmth, intelligence and good humor, the last of which comes in handy when Nick Hornby's screenplay decides to turn a clever phrase. Cute without being distracting, she's good with banter, and excels within the screenplay's rat-a-tat, headlong momentum. Although 21 during filming - and 24 now - Mulligan can still (just barely) pass for a bright, cute, lovable know-it-all, which Jenny is to her parents, David and her favorite English teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams). Poised on the twin edge of feminism and womanhood, Jenny seems a perfect early entrant for both, and yet Mulligan, wisely, nurtures the vulnerable side enough that, when the screw inevitably turns, it hurts the audience as much as it does Jenny. She's just a girl, after all, standing in front of a middle-aged, lecherous thief, asking him to...     Barber is less sympathetic on herself, for what it's worth; the \\"Simon\\" in her memoir is short, fat and smelling of cigars - more of a gateway to excitement than a paramour. The casting of Sarsgaard - experienced playing duplicitous creeps in \\"Flightplan\\" and \\"The Skeleton Key\\" - seems right, but Hornby and director Lone Scherfig choose only to convey Jenny's sincerity, while pretending David can dash with the best of them. Barber's memoir admits to toying with her older lover - or so she thought - while nearly sleepwalking her way into bigamy; the movie frames the relationship as a schoolgirl crush gone sour.     And in those changes, minor but significant, \\"An Education\\" turns into treacle, especially in its final 20 minutes as it tidies up and makes nice. That it's fairly effortless in its denouement is to Mulligan's credit. She'll deliver more performances like Jenny - presumably in better movies.
0312360266|1.0|As an avid reader, I enjoy many gothic vampire stories. Works that include Ann Rice's novels, L.J Smith's, as well as Christopher Pike's. After reading Twilight (what an awful series!) I began looking for another vampire story to satisfy me. Marked by P.C Cast and Kristen Cast seemed like it was worth it. This review is to warn readers that it really, really isn't.<br /><br />The first aspect that I hated about this book was the writing. I don't mind if the narrator talks in a teen voice (in fact, I loved How I Live Now, which was written in a similar way) but this book took it too far. When will authors learn that swearing does not equate cool. There is a ton of foul language in this book, as well as unfunny jokes that try to be funny but fail. Epicly. Such as the protaganist saying she would rather take a geometry test than turn into a vampyre--well, maybe not a that. The author also appears to love one-liner sentences such as: Wonderful. Fantastic. Great. Hell. These are not sarcastic, but just plain annoying! I swear, by the second chapter, I counted the use of over 60 hell's and variations. It's also quite frustrating that Zoey, they main character, refers to her best friend as K instead of Kayla. Would it really hurt the author to type a few more letters? I also hated how the author used the word \\"retard\\" freely. This is offensive and not cool. Don't even get me started on the run-on sentences.<br /><br />My next big problem were the characters. Like I stated before, Zoey is the main character, and also completely unlikeable. I get that most teens don't like their family, but to call her brother a troll and her step-father a step-loser? If this is what teens are like these days.....*shudders* This book is also very, very stereotypical. We have the perfect heroine, the hot guy who eventually falls in love with her (although, I don't know for sure seeing as I never finished the book), the air-head barbie-like antagonist, the gay guy friend, and a stupid, southern roommate.<br /><br />And now the plot--ah, the plot. Oh, wait, that's right! There was none. Well, not from what I could tell. It was an interesting concept, but executed poorly. If you want a book with vampires going to a school, check out Vampire Academy instead.<br /><br />I'd like to say that this book has potential. But, honestly, it doesn't. I read about 1/4 of the book, and by the time I set it down on my table, I was nauseous. And I thought Twilight was bad. Marked makes Twilight look like a piece of literature! Bottom line: Don't waste your time reading this trash, well, unless you like books with horrible grammar, stereotypical characters, a poorly executed plot, and language that will make you want to tear your hair out, then you'll definitely like this book.<br /><br />Overall? 1 out of 5 stars.And now the plot--ah, the plot.

0307386880|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B0029LHWFO|4.0|Barack Obama - need I add - is simply the most astonishing political figure in the world, for generations.   It is natural that people seek to understand clues to the soul and philosophy of the son of Kenyan goatherd who has risen to be the most powerful person on Earth.      What makes this guy tick? More importantly, do I, or did I, share any of those ingredients?      This book is a mixed bag, however, in that it seems to combine deeply moving, humane and insightful  observations with somewhat calculated political narratives.    Almost anyone, of any skin color, can probably identify with Obama's search for an identity in an increasingly complex world.   This would certainly have been more challenging for him - as a black kid being raised in a white home - than it would be for most others, but the feelings of alienation, of navigating through a cultural (and racial) maze  to find one's place is probably universal.   As an only-child who also occupied myself with books and more-than-average introspection, I found a similarities between Obama's childhood and my own.         But while he formulates the question beautifully, his seeking of the answer seems a little glib. why would such a thoughtful young man would find meaning in fairly brief and abrupt meetings with his Father's numerous relatives, especially when he had even less time with the Father?    It is not clear that their struggle - to survive in corrupt, post-colonial Africa - was the same as the struggle for respect of African_americans in the U.S. and Obama's attempts to fit that square peg into a round hole are not entirely convincing.      And I think he could have given more pages to the courage and struggles of his white grandparents who did the right thing by him, back when America's culture was less tolerant of marriages such as his parents'.          I dont want to seek perfection in this biography - (after all, we live in a world where buffoons like Deepak Chopra are purveyors of great wisdom).In the end, the 44th President still tells a compelling, compassionate and very human story and it is entirely worth reading.

I found the book readable and somewhat enjoyed it, but after finsihing it, I found that I would have trouble recommending it to anyone as a  good book. The story line just was quite morbid and quite unbelievable even discounting the dog's perspective.

Aside from a couple eerie moments and some fine acting, I can't think of any redeeming features.

0793518326|5.0|I got a hammered dulcimer for my birthday and wanted to play the music I listen to, Beatles, Who, Led Zeppelin, even Bee Gees, so it's suddenly put me in a position of checking for the good, bad, and mediocre of music books. This is one of the better ones. Put the complaints about the print size aside, if you aren't conducting a band chances are you're likely to transcribe just your instrument. Some of the phrasing is cut at an annoying place, Lucy in the Sky comes to mind, but get off your lazy duff. Forget chords, this book has staff music for every voice,  guitar, bass, drums, sitar, and what not that made it to the recording. No Mellotron transcribed for guitar here.<br /><br />For example While My Guitar Gently Weeps, you get the piano lead in, George's acoustic, Eric Clapton's electric, and Macca's bass. Norwegian Wood has the sitar parts. I've been able to read music for 25 years and learned from this book that drums can be charted on a staff as well. It's not that hard and worth the effort, especially if like me you're on a solo instrument. Some bass bits, like the intro to Lucy in The Sky, need to be worked in and they're there. Having the drums, take Lucy again and that bit just before the chorus, is icing on the cake.
B001HN69AY|2.0|The photos from this movie look great. The art department did a great job (This movie was nominated for  Academy Awards for Art Direction and Costumes) but the story is SO boring! The pacing is awful, and the movie really doesn't make any sense. It's really amazing that the nonsense \\"bet\\" around which the entire plot revolves is never clear. Also, the really annoying thing is that the father doesn't make any effort to win the bet and save his daughter, which is the main point of the story. Granted, the scenes inside the imaginarium are cool looking, but ultimately pointless.
B003AYBCV4|4.0|Just got it in the mail and listening to it for the second time.  It is a great sounding version but what jumps out is how it does not sounds as good as Parsley Sage Rosemary the Thyme.  I understand that Simon and Garfunkel may have had better equipment available to them for PSR&T.  I also understand that this may be the best version that could have been produced.  I would have thought that Audio Fidelity would have released this one prior to PSR&T.  That being said, I would love to see them continue to release S&G CDs.  Just a small quibble overall.  Do not allow my negative talk to stop you from buying your copy.  That would be a major mistake.  They are only minor complaints.

0307269981|4.0|Although the location/s and the storyline of \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" are fresh, intriguing and interesting, the best part of the story for me was the personalities of most of the characters in the book ... I think Larsson does a fantastic job of eliminating the idea of \\"secondary\\" characters ... even some people barely glimpsed (George Bland, for example, Lisbeth's teenage lover for just a brief time: Her actions during a bad storm that turned into a tornado on the island of Grenada show, more than just tell, about the couple's interaction, brief though it is; and also one of my favorite \\"secondary\\" characters; Holger Palmgren, Lisbeth's former guardian who she found after he had had a stroke: I cheered their reunion and how they expressed their affection for each other without speaking directly to it). It is as if none of the characters are throw-away; each is lovingly and thoughtfully crafted - even the villains. The author has a real talent for detail that doesn't bore or drown the reader. I learned a lot about the characters from their thoughts and actions and reactions to circumstances not directly related to the main story (Lisbeth shows her character and morality by her decisions in those sideline predicaments where no one is watching, yet she chooses to do something which helps someone else while putting her in danger). I found her quirky cleverness fun and addicting to read. She has a sense of humor that's hard to resist. I became impatient when she vanishes from the book for periods of time and had to resist peeking ahead to see when she would resurface and if she was safe or in the grips of some idiot bad guy.<br /><br />Someone asked recently if I would recommend this book to teenagers, and I would advise a parent to peruse, if not read, the book first. There is a lot of sex, and many of the characters don't believe in commitment or sticking with just one partner or one gender. It's certainly interesting to read how certain characters deal with multiple partners or different affections; it's rarely traditional or typical. There is also a lot of violence and twisted goings-on, particularly with Lisbeth's current guardian, Bjurman, and with a weird and possibly crooked cop who is part of a murder investigation, and with the sex trade story. But overall the book is a good mix of pointing to a particular stereotype and then crushing it in the most satisfying way; the old good vs. evil tale told in a clever, refreshing way; murder mystery and character study that has more than one plus going for it.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|For me, the first and foremost measure of greatness with literature, theatre or any of the other entertainment and eduactional mediums is :  Does this stand the test of time?    ... It's the reason I usually wait a decade or better before writing reviews on anything.    I'm proud to say that Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing still stands today as a genuine masterpiece in the history of television. During it's initial run, viewers, critics and the awards legions thought so as well. The West Wing enjoyed an average of 17 million watchers each week, was nominated for dozens upon dozens of awards AND won 4 Golden Globes and a staggering 27 Emmys including \\"Best Drama\\" four years in a row!    Which brings me to a question... How does one classify this show when trying to explain it to those who've not seen it? I recently spoke with a half dozen others and we came up with a hybrid which certainly doesn't fully explain TWW, but it was the best we could do... in less than seven words ;-)    So order this, borrow or beg it from someone and be prepared to enjoy the best written, best directed, superbly acted DRAMATIC POLITICAL FANTASY WITH COMEDIC OVERTONES you will ever find. It's quite simply amazing...even after all these years.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is one of the most extraordinary concerts which combines some of the best of classical and popular music. It has three of the most priviledged voices of our time accompanied by an incredible symphonic orchestra. It is a collectors item for those who treasure great music. Placido has itroduced  two young voices that will make history!
B002R68U7K|4.0|This Britney Spears cd/dvd package is for the ultimate Britney fan.  If you are a really fan of Britney, you can't loose the opportunity to have all her singles together. The box is really really cool, you can see all the covers and understand why she is the Princess of Pop.  This is a great collection of all her top singles.
B0009XRZ9M|3.0|Doesn't hold my childrens attention. I think it's a cute movie. Nice for Christmas background noise.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|The movie is excellent except for one thing: the ending with the escape boats in China.That part was totally unrealistic and unbelievable.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|After seeing Hercules come out in my youth and then Brother Bear in my teens I thought Disney would never make any decent hand-drawn films again. Turns out I was probably right. This looked like a horrible idea from the get-go and the end result managed to be somehow overly politically correct, racist, original, and a dull re-hash all at the same time. While it is very nicely animated and seems to have a so-so storyline, this movie is just not very enchanting. Entertaining enough to keep my attention sustained, but full of flaws that Disney will probably never escape from. They are just past their time.    Point number one: Race. The first African-American Disney princess is certainly beautiful, but it's obvious that her very existence had nothing to do with making a good story and everything to do with PR. I bet everyone on the story team was white, because I got the strong sense from the atmosphere of the film that they didn't really WANT to be telling a story about African-Americans. The portrayals of black culture seem thrown in as an obligation rather than being central to the storyline. And somehow this movie, while trying to be inclusive and politically correct, manages to stereotype cajuns, santeros, Haitians, and just about everyone else. I don't understand why a Disney movie would try and tell a story that had to do with race or ethnicity while at the same time being so contradictory. And if it's NOT about race, then this is an insincere attempt at pandering to an African-American market.    Point number two: Artistic quality or lack thereof. Character designs were totally bland. Prince charming was a hybrid of Aladdin and Cinderella's prince. No redeeming qualities whatsoever and it seems Tiana just falls for him because he's there and kind of cute. Tiana herself doesn't have many distinguishing features except for being black. The firefly looks just like the burned out dragonfly from The Rescuers. I've seen that alligator before too. The frogs, as another reviewer pointed out, look just like the one in The Swan Princess. During the musical scenes they borrowed heavily from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King to provide entertaining visuals. Additionally, there is not a single memorable musical number in the entire movie. Disney has produced some great jazz tracks before (Aladdin) but this fell completely flat. Louisiana has an incredibly diverse and rich musical tradition and they really missed out on an opportunity to shine by neglecting this aspect of the film. What? No Scruggs-style banjo?      Point number three: Voodoo. Lots of people seemed to be upset that this movie was too dark and \\"satanic\\" for little kids. This is not my beef with the voodoun theme, although I can certainly sympathize with anxious parents. My issue is with the completely inaccurate and stunningly bland portrayal of this fascinating religious tradition in the movie. The main villain talks to African masks which are possessed by shadow demons and makes blood pacts with them while promising to deliver them lost souls. Weird little Chucky-esque dolls pound on drums (poorly animated) while he leaps around psychedelic tribal imagery for no apparent reason. All this for what? He is the most boring villain ever! His goal is to get a lot of money and take over New Orleans. Never mind that actual voodoo traditions are about ancestor worship and drawing power from the earth. Mama Odi, the \\"good\\" witch-doctor, is also weirdly boring. Like a stereotypical western witch, her best trick is staring into a boiling cauldron to gain ESP.    And seriously Disney, the \\"people-turning-into-animals-as-punishment\\" thing is getting so old. Shrek already did the exact same thing, followed by Brother Bear. This is not a plot device you can use over and over again without consequences. Now, this is not the worst Disney flick I've ever seen. It's okay, just barely. But I feel that as a company they should stop making films until they actually feel inspired to create as artists and aren't just trying to live up to their glory days to roll in the dough. Will this ever happen? Not likely.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium does it again. First it was Ascendancy which was my favorite metal album thinking that a band would never be able to top such a masterpiece. I was wrong. After releasing The Crusade which was a big disappointment in my opinion; Trivium creates The Shogun which is an absolute delight to listen too. The Musical composition is complex as usual with a great influence from classical music - Just the way metal is supposed to be. This album should be a favorite for any metal fan or guitarist alike. This is a perfect execution of notes and vocals that will take you through a war from heaven to hell and back. Solo's to Chorus to Percussion it doesn't get any better.    Only thing I'm wishing for is a remastered copy of Ember to Inferno to add to the collection or maybe an Instrumental CD which will never happen - I could listen to the guitars all day long.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|martin scorsese has done it again,with another brilliantly directed film. two feds(leonardo dicaprio and mark ruffalo)are sent to investigate the dissapearance of a psychiatric patient from a mental asylum,located on an isolated island. what ensues is both mystery and suspense as we are dragged along each corners  of this sinester asylum. cant say more without spoiling the plot,but suffice it to say you are in  for a mind blowing ride.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|A Nightmare on Elm Street- This is the original that introduced Freddy to the world! Wes Craven made Freddy very scary, unlike the sequels! Nancy and her friends are having terrible and very realistic nightmares. When one of her friends dies, Nancy tries to figure out what is going on and who is doing it! Freddy Krueger looks awesome and scary, and Robert Englund is great at being Freddy! If you love Freddy, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET!!!<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street 2- It has been five years since Nancy killed Freddy. Now, a new kid lives where Nancy lived. Jesse and his girlfriend, Lisa find Nancy's diary that talks about who Freddy is and how she killed him. Soon, Freddy is back and he needs Jesse's body to kill people again. Can Lisa stop Freddy and save Jesse? I thought Freddy at the pool party was pretty cool, and Freddy showing his brain to Jesse. If you love Freddy, you might like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE!!!<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street 3- Freddy's 3rd is better than the 2nd, because he is in it more, and Nancy is back! Nancy helps teens with their nightmares at Westin Hills. Kristen has the power to bring people into her dreams. She gets help from Nancy, Joey, Kincaid, and others. Dr. Neil Gordon tries to help by burrying Freddy in holy ground and splashing his bones with holy water. This one hints about how Freddy came to be. (You find out more about that in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child') This is also kind of sad because Nancy dies toward the end. If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS!!!<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street 4- I thought Freddy's 4th was pretty good. Sometime after part 3, Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid realize Freddy is coming back! After Joey and Kincaid die, Kristen tells Alice about Freddy. Kristen dies and Alice is given a power because she is the dream master and could kill Freddy! There are some cool scenes like when Freddy is on the beach. One disgusting part is when Debbie is working out, and Freddy turns her arms into giant cockroach arms. Another cool/disgusting part is when Freddy is about to eat a meatball off a pizza, and the heads on the meatballs look like Alice's friends that keep dying. If you love the Freddy movies, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER!!!<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street 5- I've read some reviews on this movie, and a lot of people don't like it. I honestly didn't think it was too bad! The night before graduation, Dan and Alice are having sex, then the nightmares begin again. Alice is in the shower, then she's transported to the asylum where Amanda Krueger was raped and where Freddy was born. (Robert Englund does another awesome job as Freddy Krueger!) If Alice can find Amanda in the real world, Freddy will die. Freddy is reborn and instead of haunting Alice's dreams, he haunts her unborn baby's dream, mixing reality and the real world. During her dreams, she sees her son, Jacob as a child, trying to help her stop Freddy. There was one cool part when Freddy is on a skateboard, coming after Alice's friend. A gross part for me was when Freddy is making Greta eat a lot of food at the 'rich-people' party her mom is having. Another friend, Yvonne tries to find Amanda while Alice tries to stop Freddy from haunting her child's dreams. If you love the Freddy series, and teenage pregnancies, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5: THE DREAM CHILD!!!<br /><br />Freddy's Dead- After trying to kill Alice and her unborn baby, Freddy is back and trying to get in touch with his daughter! His daughter is now an adult and working as a psychiatrist. She tries to help rebellious teens with their problems. When she meets a guy who claims he doesn't know who he is, she takes him to Springwood so he'll remember something. Meanwhile, the teens go to an abandoned house to get away from things. I think it's kinda funny when Freddy is attacking a deaf kid in his dreams, and Freddy is right behind him trying to get his attention. I also like when they show Freddy in the past when he was a kid, then as a teenager, then before the parents burned him alive, and the demon worms pick him to do the thing he is best known for. Can Freddy's daughter put an end to him once and for all? If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE!!!<br /><br />Wes Craven's New Nightmare- After The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven is having nightmares again, so he decides to write a new script. Beacuse the Nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to get Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a lot scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray! Heather decides to play Nancy one last time and kill Freddy...for good! If you love the Nightmare series, and a movie within a movie, you might like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE!!!<br /><br />Freddy Vs. Jason- If you love A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, or both, you'll definitely love Freddy Vs. Jason! Freddy is trying to come back again, but since no one remembers him, he sends Jason Voorhees to Elm Street and kill to get people to remember. When Jason doesn't back down, Freddy gets pissed and have an all-out battle at Camp Crystal Lake. I love the awesome fighting sequences between them. I love all the blood and gore when they slash at each other! I remember seeing this with a friend when it first came out. There were some parts we laughed at, some we thought were cool. If you love slashers fighting, you'll love FREDDY VS. JASON!!!right behind him trying to get his attention.

0061914177|5.0|Crush It!  Reviewed by Brian Wing  Crush It, Why now is the time to cash in on your passion, a book by Gary Vaynerchuk, written in 2009, is a book that discusses the use of social media and the internet to develop and market your own personal brand.  The book is written in a very conversational mode, where Gary tells a story of his own brand development and the tools and methods he used to make himself the man and brand he is today.  Along the way he imparts many of the core values of brand marketing and promotion.  Gary Vaynerchuk, an immigrant from Babruysk Russia, born in 1975, comes to America with his family.  His father opens a liquor store in northern New Jersey.  Along the way Gary educates himself in wine, a growing market, and proceeds to grow that business from a single store to a wine empire.  Gary delves into his \\"DNA\\" and talks about how he sees value in collectible items, such as baseball cards.  His focus evolves into entrepreneurship and he takes over the wine business and grows winelibrary.tv into a wine empire.  He has become one of the most prominent figures in the wine reviewing business, and commands a ransom to present on social media and the use of the Internet to promote branding and new business development.  The book \\"Crush It!\\" focuses on utilizing new, free tools on the Internet to capitalize on branding and developing a business.  Some of the major themes include: Becoming the foremost expert in your \\"passion\\"; Use of social media and the Internet to promote yourself/brand; Differentiation; Hard work; and Caring.  In \\"Crush It!,\\" Gary's first pearl of marketing wisdom is take whatever it is you love the most and develop that into a business.  Educate yourself in every aspect of your passion.  Read every bit of material about your subject, find others who are considered experts in that subject and learn from them.  Insert yourself into the conversations on the topic and make your opinion known.  Once you become an expert in your field, develop content to \\"sell\\" your ideas to others.  The key to developing this rapport is building trust.  Gary states over and over be authentic and original with the content and the \\"eyeballs\\" will come.  A great deal of the book is dedicated to developing and using new age media an social networks to promote your newly developed brand.  As we have discussed (at great length) social media networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and a multitude of others, have gained great traction with many \\"old school of thought\\" marketers.  More and more Facebook and Twitter \\"badges\\" can be seen on old media promotions.  For example, television advertisements will have the Facebook and/or Twitter logos at the end of the ad, and suggest that you \\"find us on X.\\"   This is the new value marketing play.  Brand loyalty is perpetuated by \\"fans and followers\\" of these social media networks.  New networks are arising daily if not hourly.  One such example is \\"WOMMA \\" a website devoted to the development and support of word of mouth marketing.  Large, household names like Best Buy, McDonalds, Kraft, and Pepsi-Co are all contributors.  A whole new network of social media marketing gurus has been developed.  Each has a focus and specializes in certain market segments.  Another, more local, company two-five media, specializes in wine and hospitality in Sonoma County.  Companies now have the ability to use these social media networks to conduct targeted research as well as have \\"personal\\" communications directly with their consumers.  This is the most powerful tool to come to marketing in a generation.  Differentiation is another core marketing value discussed in \\"Crush It!\\"  With the Internet age upon us it is exceptionally easy to blend in with the noise and chaff.  One must truly be exceptional to stand out in a crowd.  A favorite quote of mine from the book is \\"So how are you going to differentiate yourself from all the other clowns?  (\\"Clowns\\" is, of course, used in the best possibleway.)\\"  It's this, in-your-face method that Gary delivers the message that you need to be the best you that you can be.  It's a challenge, no doubt.  Just Googling \\"differentiate using social media\\" gives the following:  Results 1 - 10 of about 59,500 for how to differentiate yourself in social media.   The social media landscape is moving at light speed and a marketer needs to \\"hustle\\" just to keep up with it, which leads me to the next pearl.  Hustle!  Gary Vaynerchuk makes no bones about the fact that 99% of the people who embark on a journey to \\"Crush It!\\" will not have the \\"chops\\" to get the job done.  Hard work and patience are the two keys to making it happen.  Another gem Gary provides is about patience, he says \\"If you contact me within a year of starting your business to complain that you haven't made the money you thought you would, you're not listening.  I said that you could make a ton of money being happy; I didn't say you could do it overnight.\\"  Patience and hard work, seems reasonable, right?  Gary devotes an entire chapter to the next pearl of wisdom.  Chapter nine is called the best marketing strategy ever.  The entirety of this chapter consists of only five characters, C-A-R-E-.  It may be just that, the best marketing strategy ever, many companies have lost touch with their consumers.  This harkens back to the use of ethnography and psychographic segmentation.  Both of these market research strategies hinge on understanding the emotional connection with brands and products as well as the behaviors that motivate a consumer to make the choices that he or she does.  By \\"Caring\\" a marketer should be able to glean this information.  In summary there are some great anecdotal stories in \\"Crush It!\\" that expose Gary's brash and cavalier personality.  Behind these stories lay some basic marketing strategies that can and should be applied to any marketing situation.  Understand your business and be the most knowledgeable about your market and products.  Use technology to your advantage.  Your competition is!  Differentiate yourself and stand out in that online crowd.  Work your ass off but don't expect instant results, hard work takes time and patience.  Finally and most importantly, take the time to care about your consumer.  They are after all the sponsor of your business and their recommendations are worth more than anything you could pay for.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|Hollywood Video near us is closing and got this cheap. Although after watching, I wouldn't have minded buying it at full price. It's a little creepy, and an interesting story, which others here have told more about. If you've seen Descent (the one with the spelunking women), then you'll see some similarities but not outright copying. And if you liked that movie, there's a good chance you'll like this one too.
B0030Y10QQ|3.0|I got into Savatage in the early days, and followed them through all their changes. I was glad to read that this was coming out, but when I got it, I'd hoped it would have been better.<br />I NEVER buy best of compilations. I only bought this for the DVD. However, I thought the song selection was a pretty fair one. I know some folks would rather it include this or that - But if you're a fan of the band, you most likely have all the CD's anyway. (That's why I never buy best of discs)<br /><br />The three acoustic songs Jon did for this release aren't all that.  He's so talented - In my opinion, it's effortless for him to sit down on any afternoon and bang out some old songs acoustically. I guess this is more of a personal thing for me.  Because as much as I love all Jon's music, I get really tired of the piano & acoustic-laden ballads. I'd rather have more heavy rock. After all, isn't that what built their legions of Savafans?<br /><br />It's nice to finally have the Japan show on DVD now.  The video quality is good. Better than some other tape transfers I've seen. But the audio transfer to the DVD is terrible.  The sound quality is muffled. Not crisp & clear. I've had the Live In Japan CD for years. It's from the same show (minus a few tracks) but sounds much better. I just don't understand why they didn't do a better job of mastering it. After seeing/hearing remastered footage of Led Zep from back in the 60's, and AC/DC from the early 70's, I know it must be possible.
B000274THQ|5.0|My wife was born and raised in East Germany. She always talks of the old days with fondness, but also regret at the tough childhood she had behind the iron curtain. Good bye, Lenin! captures some of the subtle changes that took place in the days after the wall fell down. It has a comical look at it but it is also a poignant snapshot in time.<br /><br />When they made this movie it had only been a few years since the wall came down. My wife loves the paraphernalia in the background. The type of coffee, food stuffs and other things makes her laugh and remember it fondly. Like a movie made a year or two after Vietnam, the freshness of the scenery, the attitudes of the actors, it all lends itself to realism.<br /><br />Overall a great movie, fun and interesting.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B000002B35|5.0|As far as I know, this is the last commercially released rock recording in the history of mankind that wasn't damaged by the loudness wars.  There were plenty of lousy sounding releases before this, but this is the last one that didn't sound bad.  My favorite version is the Japanese laserdisc issue.  It's fitting that Pink Floyd should have this claim to fame, as they are the band that has defined audio fidelity in rock music.  They are also arguably the best rock band of all time.  I base this conclusion on the respect the band has with collector geeks and amateur musicians in addition to the continued sales of their catalog.  David Gilmour has the only signature model Stratocaster with its own web site.  There are some modern releases whose audio fidelity isn't half bad - Wishes to Eternity SACD, Live in the Shadow of the Blues 2CD, and Flight 666 2CD.  There are also DVD-A and SACD releases of old recordings that sound good.  Deep Purple Machine Head and Live with Royal Philharmonic.  But most releases on those formats sound terrible, too.  A pancake in high resolution, is still a pancake.  Even re-issues from Pink Floyd that were mastered after 1996 sound awful.  The redbook layer of Dark Side of the Moon 30th Anniversary Edition is perhaps the worst sounding version of that album ever.  Fortunately, the record companies don't always deliberately use an alternate, low quality master for the redbook layer of an SACD.
0545123267|5.0|After hearing so much hype about this book (and after winning a copy for myself) I felt I needed to read it as soon as possible. And I am extremely happy that I did. The caliber of love story that this novel explored is one for the history records. 'Shiver' explored the unselfish love between an unlikely pair who lived each second together like it was their last.     This story gave a new outlook on werewolves that was creative and interesting to read. The idea that the temperature versus the moon influencing Sam's changes was extraordinary to explore. Since changing at an inopportune time of the year, Grace and Sam fought through hardships to keep him human for what could possibly be his last year. The struggle to hold on to each other was indescribably heartbreaking and inspiring.     Stiefvater made my heart ache with the amount of love and torment that these two young lovers endured to keep their relationship alive for longer than it was intended. Her words gave me the opportunity to visually explore this world she created where the most epic love could exist and thrive.     One aspect of the story that was unconventional was the idea of family. Sam and Grace were not brought up in the best of families in terms of the love and affection that 'normal' families offer. Sam had a rough childhood dealing with the fact that he was bitten and Grace did not have the attentive and loving family that I believe is needed for a child who went through a shocking tragedy at a young age. But through both of their misfortunes they found their own way and turned into amazing and loving individuals. Sam found his family among others in the pack and as unconventional as it was, the love he was not given by his biological parents was created with them.     I was inspired by the relationship these two created based on trust and passion. They created their own bubble with each other and battled together against the hardships surrounding them. The story between Sam and Grace still remains on my mind long after the book has finished. I cannot wait to read the sequel, 'Linger'.
0525421580|5.0|I don't know if I can properly express my love for this book. I'm a proud nerdfighter, so I've been looking forward to the day when John Green's new book would be coming out ever since I first heard about its existence. Upon reading it, I was kind of shocked. Sure, John Green's Will Grayson was a really great character...but David Levithan's will grayson, David Levithan, whose only other work I've read was a short story in Geektastic, made me want to jump into the book and give him a massive shower of hugs. And while John Green is responsible for the creation of Tiny Cooper, it's David Levithan's Tiny that really goes places. So anyways, one of the best things about these two authors is their authenticity. It's like they've grown up without having lost their teenage selves, and are fully able to capture those teenage emotions and write them into an emotionally moving story.<br />Give me another moment to fangirl over will grayson. I know many people have expressed an intense dislike of David's will's inability to use the shift key. But here's the thing: when depression strikes, it honestly feels like your universal shift key is missing, like nothing you can say deserves capitalization, or in a weird way, recognition and ownership. Your proper nouns are not important enough to be capitalized. So I found myself really relating to that lack of capitalization. Simply speaking, David Levithan broke my heart with will grayson, especially after bringing Tiny Cooper into will's story.<br />John's contribution to the story was okay, but I felt like it was the same John Green formula we've all seen already. Typical teenage guy, with his larger-than-life sidekick that takes him on a wild journey through the big wide wonderful world. The Love Interest, Jane, bored the heck out of me, and overall, though the writing was predictably spectacular, I was just disinterested in Will Grayson and his story.<br />I did not want this book to end. I felt like it incorporated every possible teenage high school problem that teens, real teens, have at some point had to deal with. I don't think it's possible to finish this book without wanting your own personal Tiny Cooper.<br />Anyone else desperately wishing for a soundtrack to this, with big, cheesy, over-the-top musical numbers? Youtube musical theater nerdfighters, get on that!<br /><br />Rating: 5/5igh school problem that teens, real teens, have at some point had to deal with.

0545140315|5.0|THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB, by Elizabeth Eulberg, was an adorable reinvention of teenage girl-power with a bit of The Beatles in the mix. Penny had her heart broken by her long-time love and vowed never to let it happen again. With the strength of her friends at her side she became who she wanted to be and not what she thought guys wanted her to be.     I absolutely adored this book! Any female who has ever had her heart broken can find relief in the idea of giving up men altogether. But banding together with girlfriends and taking a look on improving oneself can be the best gift those men can give you.     The main girls in this book were fantastic. They were strong independently but became an unstoppable force when brought together by a common goal. Penny just wanted to survive her first heart-break, but a small conversation with an old friend sparked a movement that changed everything. Tracy and Diane were the best side-kicks. Tracy was always there to make me laugh with the crazy remarks she had about everything and everyone. And Diane was an inspiration by changing her high school image for herself, even though it caused social suicide. I truly admired the theme of friendship in this book. Penny and Diane's friendship was non-existent and then one day it was back to how it used to be. This situation shows a true friendship and it was marvelous to experience. And the camaraderie that the girls created was inspiring. They were always there for each other and molded their club to be a positive influence on those who needed it.     The relationship between Penny and Ryan was delightful. Just when she gave up guys, a really great one came into the picture. The choice between swoon-worthy Ryan and her girlfriends dangled heavily over her head.     The background for this whole book involved The Beatles. Personally I am not a huge fan of The Beatles, but how Penny idolized them and connected them into her life was irresistible. The recreation of 'Abbey Road' for the coverwas truly ingenious!     I highly recommend this book to any women who is looking for a pick-me-up after having her heart broken.

Kudos to Fried and Hansson for blazing the road less traveled.
0307271862|4.0|I was ready to be tough in this review of The Man From Beijing due to the whiny political references and hollywood-like simplicity at times, but I enjoyed the book too much.    The characters got into and out of trouble too easily. The general direction was easy to predict well before anything happened, but the specifics were very convient. Hmm, that description reminds me of Scooby Doo!  :)    Anyway, I couldn't help rooting for the good guys and continuing to follow the story. Sounds like Scooby Doo again! I'm going to end this review early and start searching the Cartoon Network for some SD reruns.

B002AOWXO0|4.0|While her first effort was over-trated and was in my opinion not that good: the  music was ok but her frail voice was not well suited to it, this is a  much much improved offer from Scarlett Johanson. While her voice is not the strongest, here the more folky indie type music is much more adapted to it. Also tehre is an anthusiasm in the singing that really makes the whole effort worthwhile. It also comes from teh fact that Yron is a solid musical craftsman and the duo here really makes somethinh that feels much momre personal intimate and joyful that her last effort. She might actually be on teh right track here.

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|If you haven't seen this move for a couple of decades (like me), or you've never seen it and you would like to, be prepared for a look into the future as seen from the long, feathered hair and overly tight pants perspective of the late '70's.  Modern \\"Political Correctudes\\" not-withstanding, there is some value in the plot of the movie. Plus the attitudes, speech, and costumes are good for a laugh if you can't get into the story-line.  I recommend it only to those with an appetite for kitsch or a desire to study how people (or society) can really go wrong when thinking more than a couple of years into the future. Do keep in mind, however, that this was the state-of-the-art, cutting edge sci-fi back in the day. Oh, and this was one of the few films that qualified Farrah Fawcett to be a \\"movie star\\" (her part is actually more than one scene!).
B0039TD8LW|5.0|The album itself is just awesome. ACDC could issue 3 or 4 different albums of their best songs, so arguing if they left a certain song behind in this compilation is beyond the point of discussion.<br />The important thing is that we have here an awesome Scott-Johnson compilation that can really rock your socks off.<br />The special edition with DVD, comic, poster and stickers is just SO worth it.<br />If only special editions would always be this well presented.<br />I want to buy a car just to be able to use the stickers!<br />Long live AC-DC!<br />One final afterthought though, it is a shame that having such a great album, Iron man 2 had close to NO AC-DC music during the movie, what was that all about !? I was hoping for an Iron man 2 / AC-DC 2 hour duet... but not even close, what a letdown.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was impressed with this movie. The story line was great. I watched it three times. I would recommend people to buy this one. I don't have any idea how a child would rate it, it might not be for young children. Twelve and over would understand it.

B00005JMJG|1.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. I figured with Jim Carey in it, it would be funny. What was the story line? What was happening during the movie? Who rated this a funny, romatic, movie? It was not funny or romantic. I never laughed once. I wish I had read a review about this movie, then I never would have bought it. I do not recommend this movie, save your money. But then, out there, there may be someone that understands this movie. Please let people know. I will look forward to this review. Sorry about this review but you are supposed to be honest.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Looking for something quintessential to this new millennium look no further.  This is great music, wonderful parody, and simply hilarious.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|While many of the other reviewers got elitist and moralistic.  This is simply a case of a man forced to watch his wife murdered and raped, his child murdered and left for dead himself, so what part of \\"nothing is too brutal\\" would you not understand?  I thought it was justice taken to the full measure.  They had him kill a couple of innocent people so they could justify the ending to the story, but if you make this story real to yourself, then you can feel the rage and need for revenge after the justice system you counted on to do it's job failed miserably.  I thought it was a great movie when all is taken into context, but bottom line:  It was great as entertainment, I can go to church to get a sermon, this kept me involved from beginning to end.  What more could I want for my entertainment $$$.
0613100638|2.0|This potboiler of a book, co-authored by Bill Birnes and the late Lt. Colonel Philip Corso (US Army, retired), was a big seller in the populist middle-market and for thousands of readers the only thing they have ever read about the Roswell incident. For these reasons `The Day After Roswell' has had a disproportionate influence on popular culture and attitudes, so is in a small way important.<br /><br />The cover blurb from the original hardback copy claims \\"As chief of the Army's Foreign Technology Division in 1961, Philip J. Corso stewarded the Roswell...alien artefacts in a reverse engineering project that led to today's integrated circuit chips, fiber optics, lasers, super tenacity fibers and `seeded' the Roswell alien technology to giants of American industry.\\" Here is problem number one: Corso was never \\"Chief\\" of the Army's Foreign Technology Division in 1961, or any other time. The US Army's Foreign Technology Division at the time was very small with only two officers, and Corso was the junior of the two. The USAF's Foreign Tech Division was by contrast much larger and contained some 40 commissioned officers, and this is where all hi-tech stuff went for analysis.<br /><br />Bill Birnes would have us believe that in 1961, Corso was handed a box of \\"space junk\\" from the July 1947 Roswell crash by General Trudeau, his boss at The Pentagon. Trudeau was conveniently deceased at the time of writing, so can't corroborate this story - and neither can anyone else. Now, were these precious items of alien technology stored in highly secure, climate- and temperature-controlled conditions while being worked on by the greatest science and technology brains available? Well, no. For the previous 14 years, all these priceless alien artefacts - the greatest prize in the whole of human history - had been shoved in an old box in a filing cabinet just awaiting the arrival on the scene of the intrepid Philip Corso, who would then set the world of hi-tech R&D aflame with his brilliant initiatives.<br /><br />The claim is that Corso, with no technical or engineering background or education, then single-handedly seeded these advanced alien artefacts into American industry to ensure the development of new wondrous technologies and so \\"won the cold war...and saved the country, the planet and our species at the same time.\\" Any evidence offered to substantiate this extraordinarily claim? No. Any other confirmatory witnesses? None.<br /><br />Corso describes detailed fly-on-the-wall scenes with dialogue from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter and the like reported verbatim in florid and melodramatic prose, despite the fact that Corso himself was never present at these meetings. A particularly memorable example of this sensationalist style:<br /><br />\\"Chairman Josef Stalin was furious. Red-faced and not even trying to hide the rage that erupted like an exploding volcano, Stalin held up a copy of the Roswell Daily Record for Tuesday, July 8, 1947, and threw it out onto the center of the table...\\"<br /><br />How credible is this? You decide, dear reader.<br /><br />So was Corso really single-handedly responsible for ensuring alien tech was reverse engineered by American industry, so saving the world, the planet, the human race? Or did he simply take material already in the public domain and claim it as his memories? There is nothing about the Roswell incident in this book not already unearthed years before by other researchers such as Don Berliner, Stanton Friedman or Don Schmitt. The lengthy appendix about \\"Project Horizon\\" was released in full under FOIA years ago, but is reproduced in this book as if it were a new and Earth-shaking revelation.<br /><br />Corso died some years ago but until the end was evasive about details, dates and awkward questions about his claims. `The Day After Roswell' reads like a cheap, sensationalist schlock novel and seems to be more about book sales to a mainstream market than revelatory truth about the Roswell incident and its aftermath. Not one single witness testimony to corroborate any of Corso's claims, and not one solitary credible document as evidence that these alien artefacts were seeded into US industry by Corso in the manner claimed has ever been produced by the authors in support of their preposterous assertions. In fact, the development tracks of technologies such as night vision, lasers and microcircuits are very well understood and documented and require no additional input from fantasy alien artefacts to understand.<br /><br />Postscript April 2011.<br /><br />In Col John Alexander's new book `UFOs: Myths, Conspiracies and Realities' a useful appendix contains a 10-page letter dated 9 September 1997 from the author to Phil Corso, whom Alexander met several times and knew well. The letter raises some 120 questions and points of accuracy from the text of `The Day After Roswell' which Corso is asked to address. If you've read Corso's book, or intend to, it's definitely worth reading Alexander's far superior and more convincing book too, and studying these points of detail he raises. As a senior career US Army officer with a lifetime interest in UFOs, involved in covert ops and in the development between the 1950s and 1980s of some of the technologies Corso claims were the result of alien artefacts reverse-engineered from the Roswell crash, Alexander's inside knowledge and cool, intelligent and perceptive input is interesting to say the least. Interestingly, Alexander also outranked Corso at retirement, being a full Colonel: to the non-career military reader this may not be significant - but it is.h about the Roswell incident and its aftermath. Not one single witness testimony to corroborate any of Corso's claims, and not one solitary credible document as evidence that these alien artefacts were seeded into US industry by Corso in the manner claimed has ever been produced by the authors in support of their preposterous assertions.

0307266303|5.0|I don't even run, but I found myself unable to put this book down and anxious to share it with a friend.
0393317552|5.0|This is one of my favorite books regarding human development.  It provides explanation for the success particularly of early and ancient civilizations and why there might have a disparity of technological development during the time of European exploration around the 1500s.  However, outside the scope of this book (therefore I excuse it) are the internal intellectual, cultural, and political developments of monarchy, republicanism, and democracy as well as the necessary new social contracts between people in a high-population, low-marginal value individual that made concepts such individualism and liberty not only novel, but foundations of societal success and evolution.  Once adopted, these concepts fueled certain civilizations to thrive beyond whatever were the particular limitations of their immediate environment.    That said, it is still an excellent book on the subject of geographic determinism.      However, and sadly, I have never read a more racist, bigoted book in my life.  Reading the first chapter of this book is like time traveling back to the 1850's in terms of racial understanding.  Although instead of being in the 1850's South, we find ourselves marooned up the Congo River under the sway of the quite-mad Kurtz for whom black is good white is evil.  For instance, \\"modern stone-age people are on the average probably more intelligent not less intelligent than industrialized peoples\\".  Care to provide any supporting evidence for this Jared?      No, he doesn't.  It's just another throw-away bigoted line like any other racist would toss out as if it were the truth.  The whole first chapter reads like Jared Diamond's 'Mein Kampf'.  I suspect the environment of his upbringing has some influennce here (he was born in 1937) and he is still fighting some long-since-forgotten demons from his youth.  Isn't it more likely that both have similar innate levels of intelligence that are honed toward different sets of skills (his trying to build a shelter in the jungle example)?  Why even bother mentioning this?  Well, because he's a bigot of course and that's what bigots do, offend your sensibilities at every turn with illogical and ignorant statements.      He should take a page from his book and live by his own words, \\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but that they are wrong.\\"  Yeah, WE know that, YOU obviously don't.

B002R68U7K|3.0|A KIDS REVIEW    I remember thinking how cool it was going to be to have this item. The first time it came out, it was only a little over seventy dollars on Amazon, but then it sky rocketed to 89.99, almost twenty more dollars than it used to be! But being a huge Britney fan, I knew I was going to buy it anyway. But now that i have it, it doesn't seem worth the money I spent. This box was actually very cheaply made.    About five years ago, Britney released her first singles album, Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. What surprised most fans was that she had only released four studio albums, and now she was releasing Greatest Hits. The thing about Greatest Hits is that it was a lot less expensive, priced at around twenty dollars. And that actually had some new songs/remixes on it. Overprotected (The Darkchild Remix), Boys (The Co-ed Remix), My Prerogative, Do Somethin', and I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) had never been officially released on an album, until Greatest Hits came out. And if you bought the Limited Edition, you got a second disc with 5-7 remixes on it, depending where you bought it from. Most of the remixes on there had never been officially released either. But on The Singles Collection, you only get one new song (about having a threesome!) And if you buy the right import CD's, you probably have all of the b-sides and remixes in this collection (I did). And another thing that made me mad was that the remixes were mostly radio edits, and not in there full form.     Now onto the box itself. You get all of Britney's 29 singles, and each disc has a b-side or remix. Each single comes with its own cardboard sleeve, with its original art work. But the CD's are just plain black and say \\"The Singles Collection\\". Why didn't they keep the original CD design too? And each disc only has 2 songs on it. We barely get past 10 minutes on each disc! The box also comes with a DVD of (almost) all her videos. For some reason, they excluded the Boys video, and they didn't put the 3 video on here either. And the DVD is only a single layer disc. That means they are not in high quality. If you buy the Greatest Hits My Prerogative DVD, you will get a dual layer disc, so the videos will be in high quality. It also comes with a booklet with information about all her singles. But the photos are taken directly from the videos. No behind the scenes photos, no unreleased photos, just the video stills. And the box itself is so... small. I expected it to be a lot bigger than this. It can barely hold all 29 singles, the DVD, and the booklet. I'm scared if I push too hard the discs will break. And something is wrong with the Toxic disc. I went to go put it on my iTunes, but when it was found, it was just another copy of Overproteced! I had to spend $1.49 just to buy the Toxic Digital 45 from iTunes so I could have Toxic. But when I play the disc in my CD player it plays Toxic plus the remix. I heard this happened to someone else, but instead they got ...Baby One More Time instead of Toxic. But the one thing that really got me was, when I was syncing some of the discs to my iTunes, I noticed some of the discs were already scratched. Why was this box so cheaply made?    So as you can see, this box set has its pros and cons (more cons that pros). It really made me mad that this was so cheaply made. If I'm going to celebrate ten years of Britney, I need something a lot better than this!    Pros:    - All the songs have been beautifully remastered. I've never heard Britney more clearly that now.  - The cardboard slip cases are really nice, especially since they feature the original cover art.  - Having the videos for the Blackout and Circus era is nice.    Cons:    - Box is too small, it should have been a lot bigger.  - DVD disc is only single layer, should have been dual.  - They really should've fixed the Toxic disc, I heard this happened to someone else too.  - Should have been more than just two songs on each disc. We barely get past ten minutes on eachdisc.  - Because I have to push so hard to get everything in, the cardboard covers and the booklet are all dented.  - DVD should have had all the videos, plus the 3 video
B00000IZOR|3.0|Well, back in the 60's, this was a great toy!  I loved it.  Everyone loved it.  Now, it is a funny roll toy and that makes it great because hardly any baby toys come without batteries these days and require the new toddler to pull them and laugh.  My Granddaughter does pull the Telephone and thinks it is funny, but it mostly resides with the pile of other occasionally used toys and it wouldn't be her first pick.  Why?  Because it doesn't have any relationship to life for her.  And she is only a one year old! Telephones don't look this way!  If this were a cell or portable phone on wheels she wouldn't leave it alone as all she wants to do is grab grandpas Iphone, or grandmas cheap LG and dial (touch dial of course)  So, if Fisher-Price would come up with an Iphone on wheels or any kind of cell phone (flips do nicely) I believe that they would be in the money.  You could still pull it, it could still have the cute blinking eyes, but no dialing and lifting the receiver.  She doesn't expect anyone on the other end because it isn't a familiar machine to her.  But, good effort.  It hasn't been broken or tossed away like some of the toys that you would think she would love!

B002BFBAUG|4.0|ADVENTURELAND will be enjoyed by those who go in with either no knowledge of the story, or those that thought it might be a comedy but quickly come to understand that it's much more than that.<br /><br />More of a quirky summer romance than a laugh-out-loud comedy, Adventureland gets some surprisingly high marks for taking a tried and true genre and marketing it to young adults --  as well as those of us with a touch of gray --  who remember working the odd job in order to make money for school, and finding much more than just an income.<br /><br />Director Greg Mottola springs into action again after his wildly successful teen comedy [[ASIN:B000WZEZHC Superbad]]. Mottola proved his comedic talent in that flick, but here in Adventureland pulls back and gives us more of a bittersweet love story with a comedic shell.<br /><br />For those of you who saw (and loved) [[ASIN:B002WY65W4 Zombieland]], you'll definitely want to see Jesse Eisenberg in this film. Although he's not running for his life from brain-starved zombies, he is running toward a life as a man, trying to figure out where he's going and how he wants his life to pan out.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart ([[ASIN:B001GMH8SI Into the Wild]]) plays the love interest. She's the perfect confused and embittered daughter of a recently remarried father and \\"evil\\" stepmother. Finding solace in the sexual declivities of a married maintenance man, Arlene (Stewart) sees a kind spirit in James (Eisenberg), and the two form a budding romance that rocks, shatters, and builds as they discover what each has to offer the other.<br /><br />The entire film circles around James' need to earn some cash for college after his parents' finances fall apart. He finds the only job offered to him at an amusement park named, yep, Adventureland. It is run by Bobby (comedic superstar Bill Hader, [[ASIN:B001H5X7KC Tropic Thunder]]) and his wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig, [[ASIN:B001CW7ZUS Knocked Up]]). This park and it's workers are what makes for an interesting and occasionally funny mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand. The crew that helps run the park are as diverse as America itself, and often just as screwed up. One of them has been a long-time friend of James' and loves punching him in the groin. Another (known only as Lisa P) is the sexually desirable yet unknown virginal girl that all the guys lust after. And still another is an obviously mentally challenged security guard who is the knowledge-base about everyone and everything that goes on within (and around) the park.<br /><br />As you can see, there's a lot going on, and not all of it is funny. In fact, if you go into the film thinking it's going to be SUPERBAD 2, prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the previews gave that impression. Although there's comedy lightly (very lightly) sprinkled throughout, it's not what makes this movie go. It is post-teen angst and a surprisingly great love story that allows many of us a walk down memory lane.mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|All I can say is wow. I had seen all the promos for this movie starting last year, and I figured it would be just another movie. So I bought the blu ray to see what the hype was all about. I have seen some great movies, even this year with the Blind Side, I did not think anything could top it.    Avatar just exceeded every movie I have ever seen, even my personal fav Merlin. All I can say is wow. Simply mind-blowing. Believe the hype! James Cameron would do us all a dis-service without an Avatar 2 and 3! Get this blu ray now! It will be a prize in your collection for years to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0316096199|5.0|Lucky by Alice Sebold, was amazing. Sure, at times it made me sick to my stomache; sure at times I wanted tot throw up, but the story was incredible. Alice's college best friend was raped. Alice felt like he was looking for her and settled. Alice lost a best friend.        After her rape, Alice was afraid of the dark, the way she described how terrified she was frightened me. There is an incredible ammount of thought and passion, heart and soul in this book.       HOWEVER, if I were to recomend this book, it would be to someone who i KNOW is mentally up for the challenge, because reading this book, one way or another, will change your life. It's definately on my Top 10 books of all time.

0156027321|5.0|The author takes his time developing a very interesting background to the story and really building the image of Piscine (Pi, because the pronunciation of his name causes him a lot of embarrassment.) and his family which owns a zoo that has to move to Canada.  During the voyage Pi wakes up and decides to check on things only to find out the ship is sinking!  His is lucky enough to be the only one to escape on a boat, or is he?  Unfortunately, it turns out Pi is not alone on the boat as several of the animals from the zoo have also found their way onto the boat.  Things happen and eventually he's left with a Bengel tiger and a fair amount or food (for the boy that is).  The rest of the story is about how he manages to keep himself and the tiger alive on this relatively small boat.  A fascinating story about a clever and resourceful boy.  The author does a great job of developing the characters and making you feel empathy for the animals as well as the boy on the boat.  Loved reading about the little island they find with the lemming type creatures and how the tiger treats them.  The story seems like fantasy but it's extremely believable.  I minored in psychology and the story really used it in a credible way.  Highly recommended for high school or older readers.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|Here is a job you might be interested. Three years in a lonely mining station on the moon, harvesting and sending to Earth helium-3, new energy resources for the futuristic society. You are totally alone during the time and a super-intelligent computer GERTY will maintain the entire facility and also take care of you.    Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, terrific as always) is the current worker. His three year stint is coming to an end and he is looking forward to meeting his wife Tess left on Earth again. But Sam realizes something is not right about this mission. He is not feeling well these days, and there are a few other things Sam is yet to know about the isolated station he has been living in.    The visuals and narrative of \\"Moon\\" harkens back to an old-fashioned style of sci-fi films like Douglas Trumbull's \\"Silent Running,\\" films made with a low budget but whose creators had a lot of imagination. The interesting stories have a message or two about our society, which is thought-provoking, but not preachy. Incidentally, \\"Moon\\" is directed by Duncan Jones, son of the star of \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\\"    \\"Moon\\" is part mystery and part sci-fi, but the film's success is due to the dramatic tension between the characters including the computer GERTY (voice by Kevin Spacey). Maybe not the most scientifically accurate film, but \\"Moon\\" offers an interesting story and unique visions of the future.

B002AOWXO0|5.0|It was sort-of a foregone conclusion that Anywhere I Lay My Head would not be quite palatable to a bunch of Sarah Palin-fed, Walmart-shopper consumers. Scarlett wasn't trying to sound like the 'American Idol' musical failures perennially churned out from the stupid-AmeriKKKa factory. Half the time Scarlett was playing the role of a man, albeit an androgynous one at that. Her goals on that stunning debut were modest: she made no attempt for a technical virtuosity she didn't quite possess, and that Lady Gaga will never possess. She knew she was just chomping at the bit, ready to clear the gate. Scarlett successfully accomplished all of her modest goals, and then some.    Now, the stunning Woody Allen muse has given us a second gift in the way of musical achievement, and she, again, has satisfied me completely. This is another stunning effort, from writing to singing to all musical display. Peter and Scarlett are welcome to provide an encore any time.
B000002J1Y|3.0|I'm torn here. I am a fan of Yes, especially this period of their development.I have most of their recent (1990's and on) albums. These recent live albums draw from this early 70's repetoire so I wanted to hear the 'original' versions. While the musicality is outstanding and what I expected, the sound quality is poor: very thin in the midrange with imbalances between instruments. It's not as bad as a bootleg recorded through a trench coat, but considering the quality of other live recordings from this era, they could've done better. The sound quality is better and song lists identical in the recent CD's- with just a slight erosion in performance (these guys are now in their 60's!). So if you're a collector, absolutely add this to the pile. If you're just curious about Yes, start with the recent stuff like the 35th anniversary recordings (CD and/or DVD). Either way, they still blow current bands off the stage and deserve their place in rock history.

B000K4WPCM|4.0|I thought this was a stunning transfer in both picture and sound.  Renee Harlin came up with a derivative yet compelling supernatural action thriller with great effects and a story that is typical teenage angst amongst the potentially eternal set.  I like the fact that the powers they have come with a high price.  That uniqueness alone should have set this movie above the run of the mill witchery tale.  Don't know why it bombed at the box office except to say that Mr. Harlin's timing for releasing his movies (and that's probably out of his hands anyway) has been abyssmal to say the least.  Let some time pass...get this visually vibrant copy of the movie and give it another chance.  I like it a lot, and in the right time and place you might too.  It's too bad it went the way of 'Cutthroat Island' (another one I liked, but then I liked Polanski's 'Pirates' too!) because it could have had some fun sequels.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This review is for the Synapse Special Edition.    This is probably the greatest film ever made. Its only real competition may be [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]and [[ASIN:B001WLMOL4 The Seventh Seal (Criterion Collection)]].     Let's get this out of the way - the choice of subject matter (promoting Nazis) for the greatest film ever made is, regrettable, to say the least - but that in no way tarnishes its artistic greatness or can deny its impact. This film transcends any subject matter. In case you don't know, this is a propaganda film for the Third Reich and shows various events and speeches, and the German cityscape, people, and countryside. It's an odd movie and very expressionistic. Not what you'd normally associate with a propaganda film.    It is one of those rare films that resounds throughout artistically. It does so in a truly epic fashion. It's every bit as operatic as Wagner. It fuses audio and video in a way never seen before and rarely seen since. Just watch the opening descent sequence. It's jaw dropping. The music and the visuals are still inspiring. It conjures the descent of a god from heaven. It is truly the work of a master of the craft.     Then watch the longshots. There aren't ANY cameras visible. Also, the staging (the films' speeches are almost entirely staged) of the speeches and the marches is mesmerizing (and obviously inspired several Star Wars scenes, btw like the throne room, etc). You can see visual quotes from this movie in hundreds, perhaps thousands of other films, a testament to its enduring filmic legacy.    Features on this DVD include a commentary by a history professor, who serves to put everything in the proper historical perspective. It's pretty interesting if you're intrigued by WWII history or propaganda.     The windowboxing, I honestly do not like very much, I preferred the full frame.  I'm assuming the original was Academy 1.37:1 and this was done to avoid cropping to 1.33:1. Personally I find it profoundly more annoying to look at so much black space, but some purists obviously find this to be important. If you are one of them, take note. If you're not, this is something that may bother you about this edition. The quality of the film transfer is quite good, though.    An absolute must see for any student of film. For cultural historians, ideally seen paired with Capra's series of Allied propaganda films [[ASIN:B000NHHDZK Why We Fight]].
B000071K5L|5.0|I saw the movie a long time ago and read the book very recently.  I could not put the book down.

He has taken wild life films to a whole new level and has been narrating these films for more than 30 years. In short, David Attenborough is actually qualified to narrate this, in fact he wrote the series. I do not know who got the really bad idea to have a new narrator, someone with no experience in this field, ruin the beauty that the film crew and David Attenborough achieved. I'm not a huge fan of Oprah, but to be honest I wouldn't want anyone but David Attenborough to narrate these nature shows.

The beginning of the movie does have some dark scenes that could scare children. It also has strong magic overtones if that is something that bothers you. That being said Beauty and the Beast is the only movie with a set strong-willed princess (Mulan & Pocohantas & Enchanted ladies excluded). She is smart, intelligent, and doesn't want to just get married but live a full life. Feminist's dream princess :D

B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset offers fantastic sound quality, a mic that stays in place (and out of the way), and exceptional comfort.<br /><br />Comfort issues first:<br />Unlike a couple of the other reviewers, I do not find its soft velveteen ear-cup linings irritating, or even unusually hot (and it was in the high 80s today inside my house). They do trap some heat, just because they cup your ears, but if you need more airflow you can adjust them a little larger than you need, and they do not pinch so tightly as to give you a headache. My ears (which are rather large) also fit fairly well inside them and are not in any way pinched or hampered. Comfort wise, these are definitely top notch for this style of headset. As another reviewer pointed out the mic does not stick out in front of your mouth, but this is intentional (and quite common nowadays), and in no way affects sound quality.<br /><br />To the sound:<br />Voice quality is great. I wouldn't use it for studio recording, but for the voice chat and phone call market it seems intended for, it's great. It doesn't seem to cancel out background noise, but it does not advertise this feature, and unless you have a lot going on in the background, it should be inaudible to your teammates. As for incoming sound, it's a little above average for a standard stereo headset, which is to say it isn't as good as speakers, but everything is crisp and clear. It seems to have good bass response, and actually has a little more trouble with higher range notes (I first noticed this with  Symphonic Classical music's cymbal crashes, and didn't ever notice it in the Classic Rock I play while gaming, or in game or voice sounds themselves). If you want superb, game-changing sound, go for the surround sound version of this headset.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I can't think of much bad to say about the headset. It's exactly what it purports itself to be, which is a comfortable gaming/voice chatting headset with standard stereo sound. Plantronics hit a home run with this one in my book, and in my experience, they always do. I should add that I haven't had the headset long yet, but as it was a self-chosen birthday gift, I spent most of the day testing it. ;)<br /><br />UPDATE 1/29/2011: I originally purchased this item in Spring/Summer of 2010. A year has nearly passed, and I thought I should update the review with a longer-term opinion. That is what follows:<br /><br />After a year of use for voice chat, video calls, and video gaming, I can't say I've found anything seriously wrong with this headset. I frequently wish the cord was just a little longer, or that it was wireless, as I use it with my desktop and it has to travel a significant distance behind the desk to get to my head. It is always comfortable, and only gets over-warm if the room I'm in is already fairly warm (Above 80 degrees Farenheit or so and I wouldn't wear it for prolonged periods). While I'd like an upgrade with simulated surround sound at some point, this headset still deserves five stars. It delivers great performance at a great price.n my experience, they always do.

B0036TGSVM|1.0|Whether \\"Fantasia\\" is a great /movie/ (it's really a collection of shorts) is debatable. However, none of its sequences is less than good * (including the unfairly maligned \\"Pastoral\\"), and some are classics (\\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", \\"Dance of the Hours\\", \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\"). We also get to hear Stokowski at the peak of his conducting skills. ** No one has ever conducted \\"Sorcerer\\" or \\"Night\\" -- or even the \\"Nutcracker\\" excerpts -- as well. It's unfortunate \\"Fantasia\\" was a flop. Disney wanted it to run indefinitely, with the periodic addition/replacement of segments. He probably saw it as a public laboratory for experimentation. We'll never know what might have come out of it.<br /><br />I'm posting this \\"review\\" of a not-yet-existent release in the same spirit as the premature \\"reviews\\" of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Blu-ray, which excoriated it for being the theatrical release, not the extended cut. Whether those reviews caused the loss of sales, or have encouraged Jackson, et al, to speed up the release of the extended cut, we may never know. But I'm hoping that my one-star review (and the hundreds I expect to follow) will kick Disney into giving us the uncensored version of \\"Fantasia\\".<br /><br />\\"Unca Walt\\" was neither particularly religious or political, and (for the first 20 years of his career) was nowhere nearly as artistically conservative or \\"square\\" as he appears today. He always wanted to do something new and different, and was not (at least initially) worried about what the audience thought. The criticism he received, from both the public and snooty critics, had the gradual effect of artistically castrating his work.<br /><br />Mickey Mouse is the best example. The Mouse was such a lively, uninhibited character that parents complained he was a bad influence, and Mickey gradually became blandified to insipidity. The Duck never suffered from this, probably because he was usually punished for his bad behavior.<br /><br />Disney had no objection to bare breasts, and the original version of the \\"centaurettes\\" *** in the \\"Pastoral\\" sequence had visible nipples. The Hays Office /did/ object, and the horse/human hybrids were covered up with flower necklaces. (Several of the briefly seen female demons in \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" remain uncovered.)<br /><br />The principal censorship issue is the portrayal of a young black male centaur buffing the hooves of a white adult female centaur. His facial features and expressive movements are exaggerations of how people of that era would have perceived a black bootblack. I find it amusing and even charming, but I'm white. **** Other people do not, and after the late-50s reissue of \\"Fantasia\\", the film was altered to cover up the character. Neither the LaserDisc nor DVD editions have restored it.<br /><br />It's about time Disney returned \\"Fantasia\\" to its original form, at least on the upcoming Blu-ray, which is presumably aimed at adult buyers. Classic live-action films don't seem subject to this sort of censorship. For example, in \\"You Can't Take it With You\\", Eddie Anderson tells his girlfriend that he doesn't want to move anywhere that's not close to a welfare office! If there's anything worse than racism, it's pretending that it never existed. Restoring controversial elements gives parents an excellent opportunity to discuss social issues with their children.<br /><br />The MPAA ratings board could help, by re-rating \\"Fantasia\\" PG for its scary and \\"racially insensitive\\" moments.<br /><br />\\"Fantasia\\" also has technical problems (including uneven film agitation) that need to be fixed, but never have been. The BD edition would offer a good reason to do so. I'd also like to see the inter-segment introductions returned to their shorter versions, with Deems Taylor's original voice.<br /><br />If you'd like to see the uncensored version of \\"Fantasia\\", please join with me in posting a one-star review.<br /><br />* Other than the insipid \\"Ave Maria\\", which brings the film to a blah dead end.<br /><br />** The DVD included pieces that were recorded, but didn't find their way into the film. One is a breath-taking \\"Swan of Tuonela\\", which is almost worth buying the set to hear. Stokowski had a remarkable conducting skill -- he could get the musicians to play Very Slowly, but without a loss of expressiveness, or the music's forward movement collapsing. He used it with great musical effectiveness.<br /><br />*** Greek mythology does not include female centaurs. It isn't clear how male centaurs reproduced.<br /><br />**** I have no right to tell African-Americans how they should be portrayed in films, or in any other medium. But I should point out that some black people collect golliwog reproductions. Human beings (myself included) are nothing if not inconsistent.<br /><br />***** No one seems to object that the crows in \\"Dumbo\\" are, to some degree, black caricatures, or that the head crow -- named Jim! -- is voiced by a white actor (Cliff Edwards). The crows are so hip and \\"street-wise\\" -- and each one has a distinct appearance and personality -- that the (possibly intentionally) racist aspects are overlooked. Stromboli's garlic eating in \\"Pinocchio\\" is an intentional slap at Italians, but it's never been altered or censored, probably because the stereotype has largely disappeared, and modern audiences don't see it as anything other than a corpulent character stuffing his face with food.heir way into the film.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Hands down, this is my favorite BBC mini-series.  While the content of series is not up for debate, there have been some serious discrepancies between VHS and DVD releases.  I originally owned the 2-disc special edition DVD, and I didn't realize how washed out the colors were until I happened to watch the original VHS tapes on a whim.  That being said, I was very excited to learn about this newly released edition that has been remastered (supposedly) with magnificent color and sound.<br /><br />Today my new DVD arrived and I compared my previous special edition version with this one side-by-side and I was blown away.  The scenes from this restored edition are so vivid in color and even the sound is more clear and crisp.  This edition is definitely worth the buy.  I may be back to buy a second copy once I wear this one out.

0451169514|4.0|Stephen King has this was of making a unrealistically huge novel seem small.  I read this pretty quickly as King brought me into the terrifying town of Derry, Maine.  The main characters were all so clearly defined that I could tell who was speaking without even being told.  The style King used here was at times grating with its denseness but that can easily be overlooked by the overall sense of dread and creepiness these seven kids then adults live through.  The ending was at times a little too trippy and weirder than normal King but overall this mammoth novel is worth every penny.  Don't be afraid of the size of it.  Great stuff.

0670020745|2.0|My wife suffered a major stroke and like many, I decided to read and research to see what I could do to help. This book, written by a \\"brain scientist\\" (researcher at the Harvard Brain Bank) and stroke sufferer, promised to give the reader \\"insight\\" into stroke and recovery. Instead, most of the book speaks of how the author's \\"right brain\\" now converses with her \\"left brain\\", how the now-damaged left brain previously controlled her life, a condition now found intolerable by the author, and how all (not just stroke survivors) should become more right-brained.    The portions of the book wherein the author describes her stroke while it was happening was somewhat interesting. She spends almost no time discussing what was involved her her rehabilitation.     Most of the book addresses how the author's new \\"insights\\" into the interplay between her left and right brain had previously affected her life and how she thought and lived, and how, having had a stroke affecting her left brain has forced her to become more right brain dominent. Not only is this not helpful in understanding what the stroke sufferer is experiencing or how the stroke survivor can recover from a stroke, but there is so much stuff that is just plain \\"weird\\" (eg. the aforementioned discussions between the author's left and right brain) that any \\"insights\\" that the reader might have obtained are eclipsed by being unable to look past the weird.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|Kagemusha tells the story of a criminal who impersonates Takeda Shingen after Shingen's death so that rival warlords Nobunaga, Tokugawa, and Toyotomi won't know the Takeda clan has lost its head.  The criminal does a fine job as the \\"shadow warrior\\" and eventually wins the hearts of Shingen's family, but hubris leads him astray, he is found out, and cast back into the world of peasantry.  In the end, the Takeda clan is defeated by Nobunaga.<br /><br />Kagemusha is a film beautiful in parts but unsuccessful as a whole.  The sets and filmography are stunning and rich.  And the very long film can be watched easily because each scene is enchanting on its own merits.  However, as a single story, the film does not quite work.  One theme that characters reflect on several times is the challenge of continuously impersonating another person.  However, the film never explores this problem through the protagonist's experiences.  There is also the problem of the Battle of Nagashino, which takes up the last part of the film, but doesn't seem to have any relevance to the film per se, rather just the historical background.  Unlike RAN, which focuses on war and conflict, prolonged sequences here showing dead and dying soldiers in the aftermath of battle seem out of place.<br /><br />My impression of Kagemusha is that Kurosawa had several pieces of visual imagery that he wanted to put on film (the dream sequence, the battlefield...), and he also wanted to tell the story of the shadow warrior as some sort of autobiography.  These got mashed up into one story with the consequent lack of complete success.  I suspect Kurosawa chose Shingen because of imagery of Shingen sitting solemnly, directing his troops, rather like a film director sitting behind a camera.  Kurosawa was a depressive, and I would bet that at times he felt his directing was somehow fraudulent like the shadow warrior pretending to direct Shingen's troops.<br /><br />All Kurosawa films are magical, but Kagemusha leaves one slightly disappointed and vaguely confused.  Recommended for Kurosawa fans.d and vaguely confused.  Recommended for Kurosawa fans.

I believe we will continue to see the results of greed on our economy for years to come. Unfortunately, not enough people are listening to this and, of course, nothing will be done to change things (I mean, really change things). I just hope we can hold on to our pensions.

044654146X|4.0|Senor and Singer's [[ASIN:044654146X Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle]] offers extensive interviews and insights into what makes Israel so amazing in starting new innovative companies.  Israel is more successful than Europe in high tech!  10% of he population is involved with entrepreneurial businesses.  The why and how are the questions.<br /><br />The book states that American businesses and schools should be actively pursuing Iraq and Afghanistan veterans because many have shown the leadership skills that Israeli's routinely learn.  Senor and Singer suggest that Michael Porter's cluster concept is amplified in Israel because mandatory military service forces \\"everyone to know everyone,\\" which forms from Israeli's having only 1 or 2 degrees of separation and a military that identifies top students in high school for special programs involving teams.  In other words, 23-year-old's accomplish things that Americans twice their age haven't with the involvement of a cross-section of society (reserves meet annually), where results truly matter.<br /><br />Subsequently, hierarchies break down and people develop a wide spectrum of skills.  People talk, argue and create mash-ups like pills with cameras built-in.  Furthermore, the culture supports \\"davka:\\" performing spectacularly when people don't believe in you, and the related concept of \\"success with survival\\" which means delivering everything even when you have excuses, such as war, making matters very difficult!<br /><br />While not a must read; Start-Up Nation is nonetheless food for thought.  The features that make Israeli's rude to many people may also make them successful, and refreshingly, to some, honest.  Similar countries, such as South Korea, haven't formed many start-ups.  This may be due to the excessive politeness shown management by employees!  Consider Gladwell's review of South Korean air flight management in [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]].  Subtle differences force different outcomes..

B001OQCV2O|2.0|Well!.....after all the hype, advance trailers,etc,etc,etc, this movie turns out to be nothing more than an overlong remake of \\"When Worlds Collide\\" !    Way back in 1951, George Pal made a much more interesting and entertaining film than this - without a plethora of over the top CGIs and a bunch of clap-trapping \\"bleeding heart\\" liberals clogging up the screen.....and in half the time too.  He also had a much better script to work with...a real one !    Just substitute a rogue planet and a spaceship for rogue neutrinos (\\"Whaaaatttt???\\") and an \\"Ark\\", and you have the same, basic plot, including the (same) non deserving heirarchy trying to take priority over the (same)hoi-poloi.    You could easily clip at least an hour from this tedious movie and never miss it, and the ending is protracted beyond belief.    Technically brilliant, but I would have liked a little longer to take in the long shot effects before they were whisked away.    Sorry, but this is a butt-numbber that I won't be sitting through again in a hurry.
B000021XS0|5.0|I&W is still my favorite Dream Theater album but they came very close on this album, almost as good but not quite. This album has their best lyrics to date. It's a concept album and It includes characters, Victoria Page, Nicholas Page, Edward Baynes and Julian Baynes. The entire album tells a fictional story. It isn't as heavy as Awake or Images and Words but it's more progressive and less mainstream than Falling into Infinity. It has a good diversity of heavy metal and ballads, a few instrumentals also. It's one of the best albums in progressive metal and it's also a masterpiece and one of DT's best. Every song's good but Home, Beyond this Life and The Spirit Carries On are my favorites.

My Sister-n-Law suggested Dexter, a Seriel Killer who preys upon other killers, on Showtime, to us not so long ago.  At that time Dexter's 1st Season was a little chopped up but broadcast on regular television.    Barbara had also suggested we watch House.  It was on Fox, and quickly became our favorite, moving Law and Order's Crimminal Intent down a notch.    Of course, we had already purchased many seasons of House from Amazon.  Amazon's superior shipping with Amazon Prime is a totally FANTASTIC way to get everything we NEED, or want, REALLY FAST.    Now, with many shows playing repeats, you never know which one of us is going to be 1st to say it \\"Dext?\\" and in it goes and quickly begins with Dexter's Theme Song.  Each of us sits, bobbing to the beat, side to side, whistling....    As my Father used to always say, God Bless His Soul, \\"It doesn't get any better than this!\\"    Just splurge.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a modernized and Americanized remake of Hachiko Monogatari (\\"Hachiko's Story\\"), a 1987 hit film from Japan based on the inspirational story of real life dog, Hachiko. Hachiko is immortalized in the hearts of millions of people around the world for his devotion to his master in addition to being immortalized in actual physical form: a bronze statue of him stands in front of Shinjuku Station in Tokyo where he used to wait, and at the National Science Museum in Ueno, he has been stuffed and mounted for display.<br /><br />Hachi is Richard Gere's second Japanese remake, after [[ASIN:B0006GAI6Y Shall We Dance? (Widescreen Edition)]]. It's refreshing to see this version remain largely faithful to the source material instead of being completely butchered like so many remakes. Some detail changes were made to make it more accessible to American audiences, but the overall story structure, plot progression, and spirit are the same (mostly). A word of warning before you watch this: it tugs at heart strings and can leave you a sobbing, emotional mess. If you're the sort to cry at these kinds of movies, you'll be doing a lot of it here, especially towards the end.<br /><br />In the original, the story takes place in pre-WWII Japan, starting with the birth of a litter of pups in Odate, Akita one wintry night. One of them is then sent to Dr. Hidesaburo Ueno (given as Eisaburo in the epilogue of this film, an alternate and possibly wrong pronunciation), a professor of agricultural science at Tokyo Imperial University to replace his dog Gonsuke, who had died the previous year. His daughter accepts the pup, against the initial reluctance of Ueno and his wife. In Hachi (2009), the story begins in Japan with a pup being shipped to America from a Buddhist temple. He falls off the back of a luggage cart and is found by Parker Wilson (Gere), a professor of music and dance at a nearby college in the fictional town of Bedridge, Rhode Island.<br /><br />In both stories, the wife does not wish to keep the dog, but here, Cate (Joan Allen) is an architect instead of a housewife. (In the original story, the couple also had 2 servants.) From here, the two stories are mostly the same. We see Hachi and Parker bond quickly, and several of the key scenes from the original are faithfully preserved (again in spirit, if not exact details), like the bathing scene, the stormy night, and the massage. Erick Avari is a hotdog vendor instead of a yakitori seller. We see a bit of cultural exposition from Parker's friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a Japanese profesor whose Zen-like wisdom aids in helping Parker understand Hachi's name, a bit about Akita dogs, their significance in history, and Hachi's role in Parker's life. This also helps audiences appreciate a bit of Japanese culture.<br /><br />Things I really didn't like: The story is wrapped by Parker's grandson's retelling during show-and-tell class, called \\"My Hero\\". It begins with him and ends with him. The film didn't need this extra layer of removal from the intimacy of the original. Secondly, some really jarring scenes use \\"dog's eye view\\" where the entire scene is shown from Hachi's perspective in shaky black and white (dogs are totally color-blind?). This was totally unnecessary and distracting. Lastly, the changing of the seasons wasn't handled with nearly as much subtlety and finesse as the original did. We see a low angle three-quarters shot of Hachi with a tree behind him losing its leaves, blowing away, then growing back again, then losing its leaves, then growing back again three times, to signify the passing of the years. This was a really blunt, hit you over the head way of showing the passage of time.<br /><br />Overall, some intimacy is lost when translating this story to an American suburb and car culture. The spread of a small American town feels very different than the densely-packed Tokyo environs and walking culture of the original though the core message of love and loyalty still shines through. Despite these differences, this movie is still very good and worth seeing. It's suitable for the entire family and Gere and Allen both turn in fine performances. I particularly liked the understated piano music that serves as the soundtrack for many of the scenes. A very enjoyable film, but beware the tear-jerker factor. If you liked this, you should seek out the 1987 original as well.e differences, this movie is still very good and worth seeing.

0679746323|4.0|I listened to this book on CD while driving across country.  I had to pull over a couple of times as I wept for the tens of millions who died under his rule.  I also got violently ill at his methods of death and destruction.  I thank the authors for bringing out their point of view...it gives us a more complete picture of history so that hopefully we may make other choices when the signs appear and history repeats itself.      I wanted to know more about Mao when I ran across this audio book a few months after completing an incredible & extensive class I had took about Business and Culture in China.    I had only really learned about Mao while getting my Masters in Finance and took the Business and Culture in China class.  It was a very unorthodox class experience where everyone also did an in-depth study on 2 aspects of China.  I took on religion and dress; two things that I learned that had an extreme influence during Mao's rule and explained to me how this man stayed in power.    What I learned, in a nutshell (I don't want to write a novel for you), was Chinese culture, their \\"religion\\" was based on the family and respecting and honoring authority; your father, your king, your leaders.  You did not question authority or bring dishonor.  Mao closed almost all of the religious houses, keeping only a few open (under his total control), to give the impression to the West that he was not suppressing religion.      He removed most religious structures because he was the leader and was to be honored and was not going to share leadership or that honor with any other religious authority such as God. (I think it was fate that during my studies on China, I was also looking for a religious home and found myself in a Catholic Church.  The visiting priest from China spoke about many things including religious re-education camps and forced labor camps during Mao's rule.  His stories moved me to tears.)    The Chinese people showed their honor, respect, and their allegiance to Mao by: carrying and quoting from his Little Red Book, having Mao's picture on their wall (even if they lived in a small hut to the north), and within the cities they outwardly showed their allegiance by wearing the Mao military jacket--it was the height of fashion at the time :).    Above, I have given you just tiny flavor of what I learned.  And whether you agree or disagree with what I learned or the authors' view of Mao, this is a very moving book and gives us another view of Communism and its destructive force.  I think the book hit too close to the truth and is thus banned in China--maybe for similar reasons Mein Kampf is illegal to own in Germany--shame of their past atrocities.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|STNG is a great series but the quality of this set leaves MUCH to be desired.  Cheap flimsy cases held together with tape stuck in a flimsy plastic box with a paper insert that comes off as soon as the plastic wrap is removed.  Nothing at all like the quality packaging of all the other ST collections.  I haven't had the chance to play the disk yet but I'm hoping I don't have the quality issues with the disks that many others are apparently having.  I should have paid the extra for the individual season sets.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Others have remarked on how this movie would be confusing to someone who's not familiar with the Final Fantasy VII video game.  As one who first watched this movie in that state, I'll offer my comments on both `before' and `after' impressions.  I've been a long time fan of both science fiction/fantasy and animated movies.   Four or five years ago I watched \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" a CGI video short on a dvd called Animatrix.  I was so impressed by it that I looked for other work by the same artists and found \\"Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within\\", and the original dvd version of \\"Final Fantasy: Advent Children\\".  \\"Spirits Within\\" had phenomenal and imaginative imagery and some gripping scenes but overall it didn't have a `spark'.  \\"Advent Children\\" though was another matter.  I fell in love with it.  The characters are terrific; the graphics are awesome; the settings fresh and some quite beautiful; the action is out-there. The dystopic science fiction setting and elements of magical fantasy were very satisfying as a fan of those genres. And it has some nice wit and humor.  But yeah, the story was confusing.  Being as innocent as I was though of the story that led up to the movie, I was in a state of not knowing how much I didn't know, so I didn't miss it.   I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it a couple more times over the next few years.    It wasn't until surfing the internet this summer, coming across the movie's protagonist, Cloud Strife, by chance and reading about him that I became aware of the huge story world behind \\"Advent Children\\".  I soon learned that Cloud is a renowned character among gamers, as is his enemy Sephiroth; that Final Fantasy VII is regarded as groundbreaking and one of the best video games ever; and that there's a massive amount of verbiage on the internet about both the characters and the game.  The more I  read, the more I was drawn in.  I read complete synopses of the game and bios of its characters and - branching out to its prequel Crisis Core - watched all 3 hours of cutscenes from that video game in 10 minute Youtube segments.  Then I watched \\"Advent Children\\" again, knowing that the first few times around, I'd been watching it through a dim fog.  This time it all seemed to be in focus.  I knew what the glowing round spheres were.  I knew who the secondary characters were and how they connected.  I knew why the city of Midgar was in ruins.  My enjoyment of the movie was substantially enhanced, so much so that I was left wanting more.  The only solution was to play the game itself.    This took me a bit of self-convincing, since I'm old enough to be Cloud's grandmother and hadn't finished a video game since Zork Nemesis, but I took the plunge.  I just finished it a few nights ago.  And I agree that the game is everything it's cracked up to be.  But I know this is a review about the movie, not the game.  I'm leading up to how much more still having played the game adds to the pleasure of the movie.  I watched the movie again last night, and this time I watched the blu ray extended version.  Of course I expected it to be better this time around what with the added minutes, the increased clarity of the blu ray format, and the much deeper understanding I'd gained from the game itself, but the movie STILL exceeded my expectations.  The additional footage is a great improvement, from tiny little insertions to some complete new scenes, they're all worthwhile.  Some serve to fill in story and character development, others add even more wow to the over-the-top action sequences.  The blu ray clarity makes these quite a bit easier to follow.  And now having played the game, I understood even more than I'd expected about what takes place in the movie that I'd not recognized before - Sephiroth's tragic background and what took place between him and Cloud; why Cloud camps out in the church;  Aerith's huge significance.  And Zack!  I was delighted to see more of Zack, who's an awesome character in his ownright.  He deserves his own movie.  I was surprised by the impact of the music this time.  It derives from the game, and strongly evokes the game's themes, from battles to uneasy exploration, to Aerith's warmth and Sephiroth's sinister terrificness.  This time around, the characters, their friendships and animosities and traumas were much deeper for me.  The interconnected FFVII stories are more like a tv series than a single movie or book in the amount of time one spends on, or `in', them, and as with a really good tv series, I found I'd come to really care about the characters.  A lot of excellent creativity and effort was put in to Advent Children. Considering its limited prime audience, it's a grand gift from Square Enix to FFVII's fans. I'm glad it's been successful for them, and very happy they put the effort in to making this new \\"Complete\\" edition. Sure it helped to sell blu-ray playing PS3s and generate interest in the FFVII PS3 download, which is what I played.  But they did a great job.  They have my appreciation. I think Tetsuya Nomura's sense of character and story is genius.    In summary, I recommend this movie to anyone who's curious about it, especially if you have a fondness for epic sci-fi fantasy action adventure romance.  It hits on all cylinders (ok, the romance part is mostly in the games). But \\"FFVII:Advent Children\\" also has thought provoking currents underlying its save-the-world plot, the personal challenges faced by its characters and its sensational, adrenaline stirring action and battle scenes - the tradeoffs of degrading our environment in return for energy; the use of a soulless corporation as an excuse for committing atrocious acts; the importance of friends.  The depiction of Mako energy and the lifestream as having a healing/destructive duality also intrigues me, especially as there's a similar 'planet force' depicted in some of Hiyao Miyazake's animated movies, which I also adore.  In this extended version of \\"Advent Children\\", Reno asks how a person could ever manage to atone for the horror brought about by the Shinra Corporation (which occurred during the game), and there's mention of the destroyed Mako reactor still emitting too much lifestream energy to be safe.  I can't help but wonder if this is a conscious or unconscious reference to nuclear energy, also both beneficial and hugely destructive, and if it comes up in these Japanese stories because Japan's the only country in the world to have been exposed to a nuclear attack.  Then there's the whole question of Jenova and what she represents.  That FFVII has this depth and breadth (which you can take or leave as desired) helps make it an A+ story for me.   If you're already a FFVII fan who by some chance hasn't learned of this movie already, I doubt you need much further encouragement to watch it.  If you aren't familiar with the game, I do recommend reading a summary of it and the characters beforehand.  With video games now rivaling movies for entertainment dollars, it's worth learning about the game if only for its `historic' value.  But the game stories are well worth it on their own terms, and do enhance the movie. I also recommend watching the movie in Japanese with English subtitles. Sometimes in dubbing, the translation has to be altered in order to fit the spoken words into the character's visible speaking time, and clarity or nuance can be lost. And the Japanese voice acting here is superb.  I find that despite my knowledge of Japanese extending no further than 'hai' and 'arrigoto', the tone and inflection of the voice actors' portrayals, especially Cloud's, adds greatly to the characters' presentation.  And, compared with my memory of the dvd version, the English sub translations have been improved in the 'Complete' edition.  Yes, this movie is escapist entertainment, but it's also deeply satisfying.  My only consolation in being done now with the game and having again watched the movie is that there are several more Final Fantasy games yet to play.
B000002KET|5.0|Is it me? Or is there a very perceptible change in Black Sabbath's music after [[ASIN:B000002KE2 Black Sabbath, Vol.4]]? It seems......<br /><br />Wait wait wait. Let's back up just a second. In the early 1970s, allegedly serious music people wrote these guys off as \\"dumb rock\\" and for the life of me this is incomprehensible. Even if you go back to \\"War Pigs,\\" on [[ASIN:B000002KHH Paranoid]], there is almost a modal jazz feel: listen to the interplay of guitar and bass, and you could be listening to Coltrane and Tyner.<br /><br />I have gone through the Sabbath distography and each time I do it gets better. In sheer playing ability, this band could slice Kiss or most 1980s bands to ribbons.<br /><br />But something more is happening. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a far cry from the open sounds of the first album, or Paranoid. The textures are thicker, the bass heavier, and Sabbath has added other instruments such as harpsichord. They have also cut a lot of the solo space, and the acrobatics on here are squeezed into songs both more complex and more condensed.<br /><br />Whatever, it works. This is gleaming, buffered, perfect art metal, and even if, like me, you are coming from prog or jazz and have dismissed this band, listen again. Even as 1970s art rock, this group is amazing

0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games is pretty much non stop tension. Rather than pausing at the chapter breaks, I'd find myself plowing through them and having to stop at midway points when necessary. Mostly I'm glad I actually did read it now, though, even if it means I'll be waiting on pins and needles for months for the release of Mockingjay. For once I actually know what everyone is talking about! And I want to talk about it too!     There are pros and cons to borrowing from history. One definite pro is that retrospect lends credence to practices that we might immediately consider too heinous to be realistic. Every time I caught myself thinking, \\"really, Suzanne?\\" (and it was often) I would remember that she's actually only showing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the shocking behavior of a conquering nation. I read The Robe and Quo Vadis, watched Ben Hur, and pored through dozens of history books on Rome as a teenager. It's easy to think, \\"nobody could ever be that heartless\\" (thanks, Emperor's New Groove), but history proves that wrong over and over again. The human heart is desperately wicked. Despite my initial knee-jerk reaction, I think Suzanne Collins did a great job of making the horror realistic and almost understandable.     First person point of view can be tricky. I think of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, which most of my friends either adore or detest. I've noticed that those who love it tend to relate to the tentative personality of the protagonist, while those who detest it find her introspection and lack of action to be maddening. While there were definitely times during The Hunger Games where I was frustrated with Katniss' choices and perspectives, there was still a part of me that understood her caution. \\"So, fearing, I taste not but with trembling. I was tricked before.\\" -- C.S. Lewis (Sweet Desire -- best poem ever) Speaking of Lewis, it's kind of like at the beginning of Narnia when the reader is baffled that nobody will believe Lucy. But in real life, would you believe such a tale? So while I do find Katniss to be a bit slow in the uptake when it comes to interpreting others, I can also relate. I know when I was a teenager I was always wrongly guessing people's motivations, certain that nothing could be as simple as it seemed.    I've read and watched plenty of dystopian children's stories, and I can see why The Hunger Games has risen to the top with her gripping story and compelling characters. I am definitely looking forward to seeing how Suzanne Collins wraps up the series with Mockingjay in August (counting down!).

B000BT97AO|5.0|Reviews call Mirrormask \\"a demented fairy tale,\\" and I call it one of my guilty not-so-secret secrets. I love this movie passionately, and all my friends and family and curious acquaintances think I am insane. Everyone has his or her own preferences when it comes to art, humor, story, etc, and apparently Mirrormask combines versions of each to form a concoction to suit tastes so remote (ahem, uh) esoteric (whew) that it baffles and bores my friends but delights me (I hear that there are many other people love this movie too, but I have yet to meet these kindred spirits). In my mind, the only way this movie could have been better would have been if it had actually included Muppets. I am sure Sweetums would blend right in.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is so good that Tony Soprano is not qualified to carry Walter White's meth bag.  Writers, maestros, weave intricately detailed, unpredictable and elegantly edgy plotlines in and out of darkly comedic and silky smooth-layered subtext.

B0034JKZ3G|4.0|As someone who was introduced to Disney greatness through such films as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, it is a great pleasure to see Disney going back to its roots.  As much as I love CGI movies such as Shrek and Bug's Life, I have a close fondness to 2D animation.      The music in the Princess and the Frog is also an added bonus.  I was afraid Randy Newman was going to sing the songs like in Toy Story, but was very excited the voice-actors also did the singing for their characters.  Mr. Newman wrote some beautiful songs which worked perfectly with the mode of the story.      I do recommend getting the Blue-Ray combo pack because it comes with the DVD and digital copy--especially for those who will watch the movie in all 3 formats.    A must-get for the family and for those who are still kids at heart like myself!
0307454541|3.0|This is an OK mystery that is less than realistic in some spots. While I didn't have to force myself to finish this book, I didn't find it to be a page turner, either.<br /><br />Oh, yea, one of the things you'll find out from this book is that they really love coffee and sandwiches in Sweden...

1423101472|5.0|This book was fast paced and exciting.  The series just keeps getting better.  Start with book one and you  won't be able to stop.  The characters are demigods and they try to stop the evil character Kronos.  Pick up   the book today and you will love it!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I was realy skeptical when it came to this movie. I heard about the new tech involved and thought that it was going to turn out to be a graphics heavy slash no story movie, just like 2012. I just bought the movie to see what the fuss was about. No one likes to be wrong but in this case it's A-ok! Great story line, fantastic characters, and its amazing how they made them all seem so real. Pretty cool in my book. Don't let the idea of computer generated graphics turn you away from this. They really brought it to the next level.
0553103547|4.0|i feel bad about the 4 but it has to be. when i read the descriptions, this one looked to be in the best condition, but when i got it, the packaging was ridiculously bad, and the book looked to already be in bad condition added to by the damage from the bad packaging. it probably should be a 3 star but i feel bad.
0756405890|3.0|From p.251 in the mass market paperback version of The Name of the Wind:    \\"'You have a triangle,' he said slowly. One side is seven feet. Another side, three feet. One angle is sixty degrees. How long is the other side?'    'Is the angle between the two sides?' He nodded. I closed my eyes for the space of half a breath, then opened them again. 'Six feet six inches. Dead even.'    He made a hmmmpfh noise and looked surprised. 'Good enough.'\\"      Now, I am not even close to being a child prodigy, so it took me perhaps a minute to do this problem in my head, instead of \\"the space of half a breath.\\" Briefly: Extend the length-3 side of the triangle by 0.5 feet to 3.5, so that we have a 30-60-90 triangle, with the length of the other side being 3.5root(3). Now, the 3.5root(3) side and the 0.5 \\"length extension\\" part form a right triangle with the unknown side of the original triangle as the hypotenuse (call it \\"x\\"), so we just use Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the hypotenuse: 0.5^2 + 3.5root(3)^2 = 37 = x^2. The square root of 37 is about 6.1, not 6.5 as Kvothe concluded. I am sure a math prodigy could get this solution in \\"the space of half a breath.\\"    But even supposing Kvothe used some approximation to get his \\"close enough\\" answer. Suppose he approximated the triangle as a right triangle and did x^2 = 7^2 - 3^2 = 40, and approximated the square root of 40 as about 6.5. He still would not conclude that the answer was \\"dead even,\\" because he'd know his approximation gave him an answer that was slightly too large. A 30-60-90 right triangle with a hypotenuse of 7 has a short side of 3.5, meaning the 7-and-3 triangle is obtuse, meaning the third side is shorter than it would be if it were a right triangle. And the square of 6.5 is bigger than 40 as well.    Math prodigy FAIL.    As for the book itself, it's not bad. I wish there were more descriptions and less of Kvothe's random opinions on everything. I can't really see, touch, or taste the world Kvothe lives in.And some more action scenes would be nice. Overall, a bland but diverting read.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Another great season.  I am highly disappointed, however, that my favorite character has been killed off.  Edie was the most interesting character on the show.  I am looking forward to season 6..keep up the great work!!
B002VJ0576|1.0|I had hoped \\"Can Holmes save London from dinosaurs?\\" would be a rip-off of a Professor Challenger tale with Holmes replacing Doyle's other series character.  No such luck.  The dinosaurs turn out to be robots created by a previously unknown brother of Holmes who also cured himself of paralysis by gadgetry that would cost a small fortune today, and now seeks revenge on ex-partner Lestrade.  Somehow Holmes knew this early on from staring at something on the ground.     There's no denying the ending is exciting, but it has no place in a Sherlock Holmes film.  It's also is too similar to the one used in the far superior \\"Great Mouse Detective\\", which really was a cartoon.     I don't care if the producers were looking to cash in on the recent theatrical film or not.  I only care if the film is good or not.  This one is not.

0393072231|4.0|The latest by Michael Lewis (\\"Liar's Poker\\", \\"Moneyball', \\"The Blind Side'), this one could almost be thought of as a sequel to his first book \\"Liar's Poker\\" (much the same as Oliver Stone is releasing a sequel to his cautionary 80's era financial movie `Wall Street' later this month).  Indeed, in his epilogue, Lewis opines that the excesses that marked the 80s were never really addressed in any of the reforms which he argues were mainly cosmetic changes aimed at some of the symptoms without confronting the under-lying causes, which remained and contributed to the current, more severe crisis.    In \\"The Big Short\\", Lewis tells the story of the lead-up to the melt-down of 2008 from the perspective of the a small group of Hedge Fund managers (Frontpoint Partners, Scion Capital and Cornwall Capital) who foresaw the coming housing crash and the impacts that it would have on the global financial market and made billions shorting that market through the purchase of CDSs (Credit Default Swaps), and he manages to make it both interesting and entertaining in the process!    My one complaint was that he jumped around between the three separate narratives, often switching the time periods covered in his different segments, which lead to some confusion on my part trying to follow chronological timeframe.  Other than that, I would recommend this book to supplement your understanding of the dynamics of today's global financial environment.
B0035V35PI|5.0|I truly was not anticipating how good this movie turned out to be, the actor, Rain was awesome in just about every aspect! A decent story line, coupled with outstanding stunts & martial arts, made this a memorable film! Even my fiance, who doesn't like martial art flicks, thought it was brilliant! Buy it today & watch it over and over, without doubt.... FIVE AMAZING STARS!
1439153663|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this book but I was hoping that it would be a really good book. It was. It was better than good. It has all of my favorite elements in it ... drama, suspense, historical fiction tied in with stories of old, family relationships and friendships. I just love it. I literally stayed up until midnight last night to finish it. I just could not put the book down. When the story's that gripping, it's hard to escape from it until the last page has been turned.    Lavinia is an orphan indentured servant whose parents died on the ship crossing the Atlantic ocean from Ireland. Mute, scared and heartsick, she was sent to live with Belle in the Kitchen House. Belle's story is not unique of its time either. She is a slave but also the daughter of the plantation owner. She was raised by the Captain's mother in the big house until she died and then Belle was sent to live in the kitchen house. She took Lavinia under her wings as well as Mama Mae, Papa George, their twin daughters and Big Ben. In spite of Lavinia being a white servant, they took care of her until Lavinia's circumstances changed.     The story of the friendships between the characters who all lived under the dark shadow of slavery. Then there is the story of the depressed wife who turned to drugs to soothe away her loneliness because her husband, The Captain, was always gone. Suffering multiple stillbirths, a tragic loss and the distance of her son ... Miss Martha ended up turning to Lavinia for comfort as well.     This is a rather ambitious attempt to combine the themes of servanthood, slavery, fear, dependency, drug addiction, sexual violence and more into one novel. But she did it. I could not stop turning the pages while holding my breath because it was such a page-turner. I couldn't wait to see how their stories all ended and hoped for the best while fearing for the worst.     I definitely enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to all book club as it provides so many thought-provoking subjects to discuss.     5/1/10
B002VPE1B6|1.0|20 dollars for a two disc combo?  What a great deal.  Oh wait - this is 20 dollars for 2 copies of the movie.  No special features at all.  Very disappointing - don't care how good the movie was.    This is a shameful attempt from the studio to get people to buy their stuff twice.  And then they wonder why people download illegally...
0316066524|4.0|This is a really hard, hard book to review. Loosely it deals with addictions in a near future America that you're thrown into like a moving Amtrak train. Addictions for those in a halfway house, addictions of a young tennis prodigy, and addictions of anyone who encounters a film that leads viewers to become completely and totally addicted to it to the point that they will no longer care about anything in life and are effectively dead. There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense on first pass. You have to get used to the footnotes and the author's idiosyncratic style. There's a lot to keep track of and there's a lot of balls in the air plot wise.<br /><br />I recommend this because ultimately this is a book that at many points captures the pain and agony and struggle of those wrestling with addictions and how they try to find humanity through that. There's a lot of compassion in this book that comes across at times, more in the events and author's explanation of what happens than in a direct empathy for the emotions of characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, I left things frustrated because there was so much that I missed the first time that I read it that I believe it is book due to issues of form and structure demands to be read twice. For a book that's 1100 pages long, I didn't love it enough to want to read it twice. If you read it twice, you may find this to be one of the greatest books that you ever read as parts in the beginning that didn't make as much sense make more sense and you can revel in the author's linguistic and creative chops. But if you don't, you may leave with an unsatisfied feeling in the plot department.<br /><br />Bold because it tries to break new ground, but certainly not for everyone.<br /><br />Lastly, anyone attempting to read this book should check out the [...] website. Seeing the thoughts of others wrestling with the plot points and themes of the book in a spoiler-free environment elevated this from a 3 star confusing and frustrating book of impenetrable genius to a greater appreciation of just how high this guy was trying to reach as he tried to bridge the gap between an immense imagination and the challenges of trying to communicate that imagination to his readers.<br /><br />4 stars today may change this later....greater appreciation of just how high this guy was trying to reach as he tried to bridge the gap between an immense imagination and the challenges of trying to communicate that imagination to his readers.    4 stars today may change this later....
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I highly recommend this novel.  The other reviews for this book already pretty much do it justice. This novel is excellently written -- the main characters are completely three-dimensional and feel like your family, your neighbors, your friends.  You feel their pain, their frustrated hopes, get aggravated with the ones that are different from you.    I was interested in reading this book after reading the plot summary and the reviews and bought it on my Kindle while traveling for work.  It was a few weeks before I actually got around to reading it though.  Before starting to read it, my concern was that like many adults, Jodi Picoult would have difficulty in writing teenage characters accurately.  Sure she could describe accurately what the adult parents were feeling and thought, but how could she do this for a teenager character?  Many adult writers tend to be condescending with their teenage characters, portraying their thoughts as simplistic but Jodi avoids that pitfall and the teenage characters Chris & Emily shine in the novel as the young adults they are.    I enjoyed how this novel included three elements -- 1) the what happens to two families after a shared tragic event, 2) a court room drama and 3) a realistic portrayal of what led up to the key event -- the how could this have happened?.    And for other adult male readers out there, this isn't a mushy Nicholas Spark novel. I would recommend to any reader of any sex or age from teenage+.
B00009V7OL|5.0|When a nuclear sub goes down in the Pacific Ocean unexpectedly and a hurricane prevents the military from being able to send a team in after it, they subcontract an underwater oil rig team drilling near the area led by Bud Brigman (Ed Harris). To assist the rig team, the military sends in a group of Navy SEALs led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) accompanied with the underwater oil rig's designer and Bud's on again off again wife Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). But as they search the nuclear sub, they realize that there might be more to the sinking of the sub than they thought, and while Lt. Coffey believes the Russians to be responsible, the rig crew believes there might be something more... supernatural involved.    There are few directors that truly know how to top themselves with each endeavor the way that James Cameron does. His first movie, The Terminator set a precedent for action movies in the 80's, and he only topped that achievement with Terminator 2. With Aliens he made a movie that was at the very least equal to Ridley Scott's Alien by making a sequel that changed the mood and style while still respecting the original. In 1989 James Cameron directed The Abyss, a film that took place mainly underwater, and was filmed in the largest underwater set at the time. The set, built in a half finished nuclear reactor facility, included 7 million gallons of water. So among Cameron's other achievements, how does The Abyss stand up?    The Abyss is definitely Cameron's most underrated film. Looking at movies like Avatar, Aliens, The Terminator, and Terminator 2 it's easy to see how a movie like The Abyss can be forgotten, but on closer inspection The Abyss fits right along side the others. Like Cameron's other films, he shows great attention to detail, with amazing special effects. On a technical scale, the movie feels like real life, something that's always great when it comes to a Cameron film. But also like Cameron's other films, it's not about the special effects but rather about the human element. Cameron does a great job of humanizing his characters and fleshing out their relationships.    The acting if phenomenal, of course I wouldn't expect anything less from a movie that includes Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens) and Ed Harris (The Truman Show, The Rock). Biehn does great as a military man who's lost communication with the outside world and has to make calls on his own about their next move, and it's driving him insane. Ed Harris is great as the hard ass rig leader who pines for his ex-wife who keeps running off on different jobs without him, and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio is great as the aforementioned wife who finds being stuck with Bud and his crew repulsive, but grows close to the husband she had left behind and the crew he manages.    If you haven't seen this movie, but you like Cameron's other flicks, I highly recommend you give this shot. I would argue that this movie is possibly even better than The Terminator, and since I think Aliens is better than The Terminator, I find this to be right on par with Aliens. Give it a shot, this is definitely a sleeper classic that deserves more exposure than it's gotten.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I finished reading this book a few hours ago, and still my eyes get watery when I think about what happened. All I can say is what a book, and what a dog.....<br /><br />This book is an instant classic. Great job Mr Stein! Can't wait to watch movie version of this novel in 2012.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Perseus (Sam Worthington) was found by a fisherman in the middle of the sea when he was only a child. Raised by the fisherman, Perseus was treated like a son despite his mysterious beginnings. But when his adoptive family is killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in the midst of the Greek city Argos' war against Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus finds out that he's a demigod, the son of Zeus. Rather than joining the gods in their war with the humans, Perseus joins the humans in an effort to find out how destroy Hades' Kraken, a legendary destroyer of cities, and in turn seek revenge for the death of his family.     I'm fairly certain that I'm not the only one who, when this went into production, wondered why they chose to remake a 1981 film rather than creating a movie based on the hugely popular God of War video game series. I guess part of my reticence to this idea has to be my general disinterest in remakes, but at the same time one has to admit that video game movies generally fare worse than remakes as a rule. Then the casting started poring in for this remake/reimagining, and I started to get a bit excited about it. Sam Worthington proved his mettle as the best part of Terminator: Salvation and did a great job in Avatar, and anytime you have Liam Neeson and/ or Ralph Fiennes in a movie, especially together (they're first time on screen together since Schindler's List) you're most likely up for a good time. To fill out the brilliance on screen, Louis Leterrier was set to helm the project having done movies that have ranged from merely good (Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) to transcendent (Unleashed or Danny the Dog). Needless to say I was more than slightly interested to see what this would all lead to.    While you might expect this film to completely re-imagine the film, but rather even down to the special effects the films has a much more old school feel to it. This is both one of the strengths of the movie and a detriment to the movie as well. While it utilizes all ofthe special effects at it's disposal, it still lumbers like an unweildy beast at times. The mix of CGI with the look of practical effects doesn't look as good as other movies that have come out recently, and other creations don't mix well with the practical creations. Overall, though, Leterrier knows how to work an action sequence, and the action really does work, even if the ending is slightly anticlimactic. The most disappointing aspect of the movie though is the 3-D transfer which doesn't appear to be in 3-D except the very beginning of the movie, other than that the cost of the 3-D surcharge is asking a lot of viewers, and proves just to be nothing more than a cash making gimmick by Warner Bros.    With all of the great actors that were involved in this movie, the acting is strangely subpar. Ralph Fiennes hams it up as god of the underworld Hades as does Jason Flemyng as former King of Argos Arcisius, and Liam Neeson isn't given much to do as uber-god Zeus. Sam Worthington is surprisingly flat as the demigod Perseus. Most of the time Worthington appears to be bored or just not even trying. Of everyone on the cast the most believable actors are Pete Postelthwaite as Perseus adoptive father Spyros, and his demise early on in the movie is truly lamentable, and Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless beauty who helps lead Perseus to his destiny of defeating the gods.    I'm not saying the movie's horrible, this isn't Transformers 2, but it's also not Avatar either. All in all it's still a fun movie worth a look-see, but it's definitely not the best that the cast and crew could possibly have to offer. I enjoyed myself at the theater for this one (even if I was annoyed by paying the 3-D surcharge for nothing), and I suggest you give it a shot. You might find yourself slightly disappointed, but you'll probably still have fun as well.    3/5
0375842209|4.0|When I saw the reviews for this book the story line grabbed my attention.  I have put off reading the book since it was a young adult selection.  But curiosity got the better of me and I used it as my selection for my book club.  To my surprise another member was planning on using it as her next pick.    We all agreed it was a wonderful story and we especially enjoyed the characters. Papa has the heart of an angel and stays true to his beliefs in the hardest of times.  And while Mama is harsh you are given glimpses that she is really a loving mother.    Liesel and Rudy's life set in another decade is not so unusual.  They sturggle at school, play with friends in the street, and get into a fair bit of mischief.  The story mixed with the complecations and hardships of the war pulls you in.  I was interested at every turn how the people in her life would affect her and how she would stay true to the person inside....just like Papa.    I am glad I took a chance on what I classify as \\"popular fiction\\".  I thought the characters were delightful and each shown for their quirkiness.  And the history was entwined in the story enough to add but not too much to distract.    A lovely read.
0393072231|5.0|If you are interested in the recent economic debacle and how stupid, greedy and crooked Wall Street is, this is the book to read.  It is enlightening and entertaining. I will be following the Justice Department investigation of Goldman Sacks with great interest. I hope we have enought jail space for everyone who should be locked up.  I am re-reading the book right now.
0385504225|1.0|I don't get to read many books. I picked this up for vacation. I was really drawn in for the first half. The ending was half predictable and half \\"who cares?\\". Could have wrapped this up in about 100 fewer pages.
0156027321|2.0|I have read the Life of Pi and found it quite the fantasy. (SPOILER ALERT) If you read to the end you will see that Pi admits to making it all up so he wouldn't have to confront what horribleness really occurred. A sad tale with really no take-away wisdom. The inside cover of the book makes the insane claim that this book may make you believe in God. There is nothing in the book that would substantiate that ludicrous statement. The book is well written and if you are interested in the difference between the two and three toed sloth, you will enjoy the first half. If you like fantasy, you will like the second half.

0783225857|5.0|I love this edition, very clear in black and white, an original.  It follows the book very closely and really explains the points that you might not understand from the book.  It clarifies, explains, and helps you to understand the backgound of the time and events of the novel.  This is a 5-star edition and is highly recommended.

B000IMV4IW|3.0|I have to agree with the first reviewer. So many songs were left off of this compilation that I actually didn't buy it. I'm a huge Oasis fan but I didn't see any reason to buy this. Way too many great singles and B-sides were left off. I am better off making my own best of with the previous CD's and CD Singles I have purchased over the years. Nice art work though.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|Wonderful beautiful music.  I bought it for \\"Africa\\" Fantasie Op. 89 but was totally pleased with both CDs.  Saint-Saens like I have never heard before.  Two thumbs up!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great documetary which truly shows the advent of where our food sources are coming from.  I can see and understand how Vegans exist when viewing a documentary as this.  But this DVD  should be seen by all for a reality check and eye opener to the problems that currently exist with   all the medical issues and obesity. I highly recommend this DVD .
B000EO91CU|5.0|Bought this book for the story about Bill W., the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. I had the book some years ago but missplaced it along the way. A great aunt of mine had it on her book shelf and I asked if I could have it and she said yes. It is now in my own little library of books and reminds me of my great aunt julie. Anyone else interested can look as there was other copies for sale on Amazon.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I have read the numerous reviews of ignoramuses who give 5-star movies/concerts a 1-star review because they \\"got their disc late\\" or some other innocuous reason.  The reason this review is 1-star is because I own a top of the line LG BD-390 blu ray player, which I bought as an upgrade to a much earlier player that balked at playing several blu ray discs.  The most recent firmware was installed today - the same date I bought the avatar blu-ray.  NO LUCK.  The picture balks at playing anything using the new firmware that it did before.  Pathetic.  The disc goes back for a refund, with my time being that which is wasted - not James Cameron's.

B002N8A14M|5.0|This case is exactly what I wanted.  I had a black leather case for my old (white) nano, but who wants to cover up the great colors you can get with the new nanos?  The case is very secure and sturdy, and I like the flexibility of being able to use it with just the clip or the arm band (I don't need to keep it on my arm when I am just walking around the house cleaning).  The only minor annoyance involves the top and bottom of the case.  The top and bottom are open so you can get to the hold button and plug the headphones/sync cord in, but the openings are pretty small.  I usually have to use my nail to get to the hold switch at the top and, to second another reviewer, if you use a different kind of head phones that have a bulkier jack you are out of luck.  Thankfully this was not a deal breaker for me and I have really like this case.
B002UD56I6|4.0|This Is It DVD is a great testament to the genius of Michael Jackson. Knowing how much of a perfectionist MJ was, he would have not approved of some specifics in this documentary like the lighting, the sound quality,some of the shots of himself, etc. However, I look at this DVD as an autograph for my collection. I especially loved seeing the more human side of Michael, not just the entertainer side. He was a very special man.
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Skloot deserves high praise for excellent research, clear and impartial writing, and the sheer determination required to explore this story from all angles. There are in fact several stories told here - the scientific uses of the cell line derived from Henrietta Lacks, the moral issues relating to the use of human tissue without consent, the Lacks family history prior to Henrietta's death, and the Lacks family today. While the scientists who exploited the cell line did so with the best of intentions, and without racism, their inability to communicate effectively with Henrietta and her family is tragic. Each of these stories is told sensitively, concisely and objectively. I look forward to reading the next book from this author.

0307269981|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Stieg Larsson. He writes with such great description and mystery!
B001AQT11M|5.0|The clarity of this DVD is amazing and of course it's one of Disney's   very best. A joy to watch all over again and again. Great for the grandchildren which is why I purchsed it but I love watching it with them.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|This box set is good value, the series done in the 70's would seem dated for younger viewers , but it is a great visual history of world War 2 for students of history and for the younger generation to understand how this event changed the world they live in now.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Yes, it's not like the book but the show is great. I love both ! Amazing cast, epic fight,good stories, great soundtrack....AWESOME !!! Welcome to the Midland !!! I'm looking forward buying and watching Season 2 .
B003GSLX5Y|1.0|This book is formatted horribly. Chapters start in the middle of a page the way sentences should. Sentences are broken up and choppy. It's a shame that a book meant to guide people on writing techniques is done this bad in Kindle edition. Hopefully Amazon puts one out that is done right, because this book is an essential one to own, and I'm tired of carrying around my beat up paperback copy.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Loved this movie. The songs are great and the scenes have an amazing background of the Greek Islands. Wonderful!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not simply one of the greatest Sci-Fi shows ever put on, one of the greatest shows period.  The characters are all incredibly well created, acted, and given the chance to grow and be flushed out by outstanding writing and diversity in the episodes.  The graphics are also great and do not hinder the story, as can sometimes happen with TV Sci-Fi.  Simply put, this is one of the most unique shows with its mash-up of the wild west and space and it should not be missed.  Its a shame it was only on for such a short time.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|Only one other reviewer on this page seems unhappy with the remastering of these wonderful performances, but I do think he has a point.  There is a lot of mid-to-low range boost on some tracks, which can be startling when the orchestra bursts in.  Other reviewers are also correct to say that the sound in general is lively and sparkling, giving the orchestra great presence.<br /><br />The first movement of the great 9th is a case in point.  Throughout, the orchestra is very symphonic.  During the opening bars, if I turn the volume up enough for the piano to sound realistic, those E flat chords make me jump; if I turn it down, the piano becomes a tinkle.  Later in the movement, the balance is much better and everything works beautifully.<br /><br />I think part of the issue is that Perahia is a particularly fluid, sensitive, mellifluous performer whose playing is modulated in a way few other pianists can achieve; by contrast, the orchestra can seem more exuberant than necessary.  Another part of the issue is that the modern sound engineers have had to work with the inherent limitations of 1970's recording technology.<br /><br />The levels of boost should not be ignored.  If you are going to play these concertos at low volume, you might not find a single obtrusive note in any of them.  If you turn up the juice, there will be times when you will find yourself wincing.<br /><br />Playing with the equalizer settings will certainly help.<br /><br />I would be tempted to take off a star for those moments when the orchestra bites your ear off -- but Murray Perahia is such a wonderful pianist, and the orchestra so perfect, that I recommend these recordings to anyone.  You could see it as having a not-very-good seat in an old-fashioned symphony hall, say, next to a pillar, where the acoustics are sometimes a little odd; but it is unquestionably better to be in the hall than not to attend.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The mash-up Whedon has done with the wild-west and sci-fi is one of the greatest things to come to TV and the big screen.  Through Firefly and Serenity one gets to see unique characters, deep and poignant stories, excellent music accompaniment, and creative writing all inter-mixed.  Sit down and let this spectacle take you away as you feel for the characters, the situation, and everything else in this great movie.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|This movie certainly looks great. The colors and textures are vibrant and realistic, at least as far as an alien world is concerned; the sci fi hardware is authentic enough, and so on.  Great job by the art dept., FX people, etc.    The soundtrack sounds quite a bit like the ones for Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan and Aliens.  It's probably the same composer.    And how many times have we seen this story already?   Whether you call it Pocahontas, The Emerald Forest, Dances with Wolves, or something else, it's the same deal:  Indigenous people live in harmony with nature; rapacious invaders arrive to plunder and kill; natives fight back; someone from among the invaders goes rogue and goes native and turns against his own people once he sees the error of their ways.     Yawn.   Been there, seen that.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an amazing movie!  I will watch it many times to come in the future.  So happy Sandra Bullock received an award for it.
B000000OQY|5.0|I got this game for my husband because he loves GNR.  He has CD years ago but it got lost.  I am glad i found it for so cheap!
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I personally could only watch a full episode if I mute the sound. For real Oprah???? At least choose someone with a nice voice if you're going to pick someone with no scientific knowledge. Go with the BBC version 1000 times more educational as it is not directed towards 8 year olds.
0066620996|5.0|An exceptional book that lays out easy-to-comprehend fundamentals which propel organizations to the realm of greatness. While there are several books that talk of 'must haves' within an organization, this masterpiece by Jim Collins sequences the key variables into a logical and sequential manner that is, at once, compelling & thoughtful.<br /><br />One of the chapters begins with a Bertrand Russell quote 'Most men would rather die, than think. Many do'. The entire book makes you do just that. Think.<br /><br />I would recommend Good to Great not just to understand what makes an organization great, but also to apply it to aspire for personal greatness.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is the first laugh out loud sit-com in years. The writing is superb and the cast couldn't be better.
B001W6RRNY|4.0|Built to Last weaves the seeming contradictions of the need to have an 'unchanging' core ideology with the compulsions of making 'progress' into a cohesive strategy that have been applied by organizations for over a century in their quest for enduring greatness. You learn that dogged determination is just as important as trying as many things, having a cult-like culture is as critical as relying on building a strong management and articulating an audacious goal is as compelling as the organization's focus on clock building (as opposed to time-telling).<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book after Good to Great.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|The second season of Big Bang was still the funniest comedy ever.  The writing slipped just a tiny bit, but the dialogue is so intense,it's easy to forgive. A wonderful third season put them right back into perfection. I hope they don't make the mistake of getting more and more raunchy as some other shows have done...\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" is a perfect example.  This show doesn't need it..keep it on a cerebral level, please. It's perfect as it is.
B00006YXE4|5.0|I am a long time fan of Eric Clapton and have owned this album since shortly after it first came out; I purchased this copy for a friend. This particular album is a selection of what I think are his finest songs.  And this blend of musicians gives them all a very special touch. I consider this his finest work.
1439153663|4.0|There are many compelling aspects to this novel.  The not-quite-Tara depiction of ante-bellum south, the strong family connections and social stratus of the slave population, the little-written-about topic of indentured servants (who were practically slaves), and the seldom discussed topic of laudaunum abuse. The Kitchen House is a very readable novel, a compelling page-turner.  However, it is not a pretty story.  And I believe the author romanticized many aspects.<br /><br />I suspect that an indentured servant would never have been able to overcome the social strata of the time to become lady of the house, no matter how pretty she was.  There were way too many coincidences and unrealistic (with the knowledge of history and hindsight) actions to make this a totally believable novel.  Would the lady of the house have maintained such a relationship of \\"equals\\" with the blacks that raised her?  How much actual effort would have been given to teaching even favored mulattoes to read and write?  If the farm help took care of the tutor, why didn't they eventually take care of the evil overseer?<br /><br />Kathleen Grissom has written a wonderful novel.  Read it and enjoy.  But remember it was written from our time and place, not the late 1700s.
B000005RTQ|5.0|This is an amazing disc.  Crusader is classic \\"battle metal\\" and the cover of Set Me Free is fierce.  I got the chance to see them on this tour and meet them back stage.  This release will alway's fo down as one of my top 10 all time favorite metal releases of all time...
B000X2H8G4|5.0|We got this just to be able to carry on a normal conversation with my elderly mom.   It works great for this!  Other than that, just what do you expect for thirty bucks?   I ordered a few more.  Basically, this gizmo amplifies EVERYTHING in the room.   My mother heard birds singing outside that she had not heard in years.  Plus, when she's wearing this, we all don't have to yell to get her to hear her.    It works better for basic conversations than the very expensive hearing aids that she always lost, and that no one could remember how to adjust.
B001EO748M|1.0|Dear Amazon,  I was very surprised to find the poor quality of the DVD I purchased from you.  I bought three seasons of \\"The Tudors\\".  The second season was of poor quality.  The picture jumps and I was very unhappy!! I would like a refund.  Thank you for your help.
1563899426|5.0|I picked up this TPB because James Jean does the covers, and was delighted when the story proved to be just as intriguing as the artwork.  Fables has quickly become one of my top favorite comics and I've gotten two of my friends to read it as well.    The story constantly progresses and does so in such and intriguing way that I would buy the volumes three at a time and finish them the same day.  I would recommend this story to anyone, especially those who enjoy fairy tales with a twist.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|If you like no, plot, poor, acting, tired unoriginal story ideas and dull as dishwater \\"beautiful\\" Hollywood people recreated as Smurfs in a ripped off version of Pocahontas, then this movie is for you.    The Special effects much like putting frosting on a turd are nothing more than that. You know how this movie is going to end as soon as it starts and there is nothing in its 3 hours that will take you by surprise or is anything you don't see coming 3 miles away.    If you like fluff, this is it.    If you want to see a good movie about cartoon characters flying dragons watch \\"How to Train a Dragon\\" a superior movie in everyway
0060935464|1.0|Harper Lee wrote one book, and it consisted mostly of random events that happened during her childhood with no rhyme or reason, and it becomes regarded as one of the greatest works ever written.    I simply do not understand.  I read this book, and it became apparent rather quickly that all the events in the book had no relation to one another.  Nothing progressed the plot at all.  It was essentially \\"this happened, and then this happened, this happened too.\\"  None of it presented or built upon any one storyline, and quite frankly, most of it was very uninteresting.  Atticus was the only character that I could bring myself to like.  The trial was the most interesting part of the book, which not coincidentally, barely involved the main character, Scout, at all.    Definitely not worth all the praise.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Besides \\"[[ASIN:B0030A6ID0 Red Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II [Blu-ray]]]\\" this is one of the best movies I have seen lately.  Great story line... Beautiful exotic scenery.  I watched the 3-D version in theater.<br /><br />As a result, I jumped in and bought the DVD when it first came out in April.  To my surprise, the color quality was greatly disappointed.  The rich vibrant colors of the forest, of those exotic creatures were replaced with a dull, boring color.<br /><br />If you plan to buy the DVD, maybe you should wait until the next version released in November.  I don't know if the blue-ray version is any better.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Updated review...<br /><br />After written the above review, I went searching for a solution for the issue mentioned above.  Well, it was not because of the DVD but rather it was the issue with the video cable connecting to the TV.  Sorry.

Keep going untill you've mastered the moves.  I love this dvd.  I don't even have to think.  I just watch and follow and finish my workout.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I really enjoy watching animated movies, guessing the character who plays by the voice and facial animation...every time I view they become realer and realer! It is a pleasure spending time with our 7 year old daughter........so really enjoyed the movie \\" Horton hears a Who\\"
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a truly enjoyable and thoughtful story with the actors a wonderful fit.  I've watched it over and enjoyed it as much the second time.

0307454541|1.0|I realize the online reviews for this book are all great. Maybe it's me, but I think \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is just awful. I found it to be, at best, a second-rate mystery. I guessed the answer about 100 pages into the book. The protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, is not only unlikeable, but pretty much unbelievable. And I don't know if it was Larsson's original Swedish text or the translation, but I found the prose to be no better than high school. It was littered with tired cliches and oddball phrasings. Who says \\"anon\\" or \\"forsooth\\" anymore? Well, the characters in this book do. And why all the minute detail about the computers the characters use? Yes I read the entire book; its 600 pages read extremely quickly. The book, for the most part, held my attention. The gruesome aspects had a certain fascination. You root for the other protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, to succeed. But the bible/murder connection essentially went unexplained. The hacker aspects of the book are likely swallowed by the masses, but it was clear the author had no real understanding of computer technology. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is good for the beach, long plane trips, or any other venue where critical thinking about what you're reading is not desired.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I rented this to see if I would like it enough to buy it> I did buy it and have watched it more than once since. I also bought the sound track because I like the music.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I have been a fan of the show since it aired in 2008.  I recently bought season.  This is an amazing journey filmed in the beautiful backdrop of New Zealand.  Prophey and Destiny the first two episodes in the series is a great introduction.  The opening scene is breathtaking as you see Kahlan Amnell with her sister on horseback as they try to outrun the D'Haran quad that is chasing them.  The first time we see Richard Cypher the simple woodsman with no clue as to what lies ahead is particularly enjoyable if you like to see a guy chopping wood shirtless...I do!  The last part of the 2nd episode called Destiny was quite dramatic and continues to never leave me in awe no matter how many times I see this episode.  The defining moment when Kahlan realizes that Richard is the true seeker, it never fails to move me.  There are so many great episodes to enjoy in season 1.  Episode 8 called Denna was another great episode and really defined Richard.  Captured by Denna a Mord-Sith he is tortued by Denna who will eventually break him.  Richard is only too aware of what this will mean and would rather be confessed by Kahlan than suffer that fate.  It was a powerful scene. Just as powerful as the scene where Denna is forcing Richard to kill Kahlan, the Mother Confessor.  No words spoken in this particular moment but the expressions on both Craig Horner and Bridget Regan's faces told the tale only too well.  Both were brilliant in this episode as was Jessica Marais was simply phenomenal as Denna.  You just loved to hate her that's how good she was in that role.  I could go on and on but don't want to spoil people how have not seen the show but suffice to say there are many more great episodes.    Magic, sorcery, forbidden love, evil villians tranport yourself to another time and place.  Find yourself confessed, seek the truth.  This is a must see!  I am anxiously waiting for season 2 to be released as it will be purchased as soon as it is available.  I am hoping that we will havea season 3.  The journey must continue, there is so much more that needs to be told.  Save our Seeker!
B000YI7MRM|5.0|A marvelous film about the decadence of Spain in the 17th century from the super power of Europe to a new dark age. Highly recommend it to lovers of adventure films,historians, and admirers of Spanish culture. Might be a difficult film to follow for people not familiar with Spanish and European history of the 17th century
B000O8OTNC|5.0|First saw these combo sharpeners by the register of my local Big 5 for $14.99, picked up one to try out and it has now become my goto tool for all my knife care needs.   I know own several of these little guys, their light, easy to use and great for the price. Love the two stage sharpener and the serration hone is perfect for keeping my combo blades at their best. Huck one in the truck, tackle box, ruck sack or even the knife drawer! If you use your knife frequently, your going to inevitably run it dull but with the pocket pal you'll bring it back to shaving sharp with only a few passes. highly recommended.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I am a huge lifetime fan of this genre.  Tolkien was a tremendously gifted author and the LOTR series of books has had a huge impact worldwide from the time it was first released.  I was excited when I heard that the series was going to be made into a movie.  However, as happens so often when trying to take a story of this magnitude and put it on the silver screen, I was afraid that the movie would fall short of the expectation.  I'm happy to say the movie exceeded the expectation.  And while some would say the original was too long, all I could say was give me more.  The extended versions fulfill that request.  And, while I was disappointed that the movie did not include the return to the Shire at the end, it is still one of the greatest movies of all time.  As stated previously, if you are a fan of LOTR, the extended additions are a must-buy.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This takes me back to my teen years.  It has all of my favorite Elton John songs, mainly on Disc 1.   Disc 2 is the later years when I didn't keep up with music as closely as in those teen years.   It is great to get all of my favorites on one CD and at such a low cost.   I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Elton John, especially in the 70s.
B001BTG3OQ|1.0|Love my sb800 flash, but hate this flash for one reason-it shuts down after a few shots so it doesn't overheat.  When I feel the flash, it doesn't feel hot at all.  I can only get maybe a dozen shots within about 2 minutes.  Then, you have to let it set several minutes before using.  Guess what; I'm using my sb800 more than ever.  I like the fact that the 900 is a little more powerful, but can't use it much at all at weddings or children where need fast shooting.  I'm truly disappointed.
0061703257|3.0|Dennis Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\" has been compared to many noir thrillers in other reviews, allow me to depart and say it owes much to Walker Percy' \\"The Thanatos Syndrome\\" where shadowy psychologists are pulling the strings while the detective unravels the truth. It also owes a tremendous debt to John Fowles \\"The Magus\\" and to William Hjortsberg's novel \\"Falling Angel\\" (latter made into the movie \\"Angel Heart\\").<br />The story opens with the recollection of Shutter Island from an aging psychiatrist, which becomes a useful device to describe the Agatha Christie-like bounded territory of our mystery. In a long flashback, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule arrive in 1954 on an irregular ferry to the Shutter Island Prison for the Criminally Insane and begin investigating the disappearance of a beautiful young woman, who apparently used her beauty to walk through walls.<br />As their investigation proceeds,  the backgrounds of our two Marshalls becomes more filled in as they exchange their life stories while facing roadblocks, stonewalling, and transparent acting and misdirection from hospital patients, orderlies, nurses, doctors, and the warden. Frustrated from the misdirection, the two \\"go bamboo\\" and in the guise of orderlies use the confusion wrought by a hurricane's damage to the island facilities and security to investigate all the things now one wants them to see. Along the way, Teddy uses his war-time experience in OSS intelligence to break codes salted by unseen friends helping them to arrive at the truth everyone appears to be holding from them.<br />The narrative moves from investigative procedural to psychological investigation, where everything seen is questioned, and it is unknown what is staged or confessed.<br />This is an enjoyable yarn, but too short a distance of a derivative from some obvious fathers of literature to pronounce that it is original in any sense. Similarly, Lehane's prose is jerky: lean where it should provide a memorable description, and over-worded for the commonplace. The last criticism is perhaps excusable, for Lehane strives to create a sense of place for his native New England coast, and he needed a device to introduce leitmotifs for his ultimate twists and resolution.iption, and over-worded for the commonplace.

B000002GYW|5.0|The Eagles' multi-platinum records Hotel California and The Long Run are their biggest sellers.  Indeed, being an Eagles fan, I think they're both great records.  However, I think Desperado, which originally came out in '73, is the Eagles' true masterpiece.  It's their one and only &#34;concept&#34; record; it's an allegory that compares the life of a rock-and-roller to that of an outlaw in the Old West, and the guys are featured on the cover in Western dress.  Desperado was also the last record the Eagles did as a four-man band in the '70s; Don Felder would join the Eagles' original lineup of Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner in '74, the year after Desperado was released.  Desperado may not be the Eagles' biggest selling record, but it's certainly their most consistent.<br /><br />The opening track &#34;Doolin-Dalton&#34; recalls the bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas, that went awry when two members of the Doolin-Dalton gang were killed.  In &#34;Twenty-One&#34;, Bernie expresses the gunslinger's youthful confidence:  &#34;I'm twenty-one and strong as I can be/I know what freedom means to me/And I can't give a reason why/I should ever wanna die.&#34;  The good-time rocker &#34;Out of Control&#34; is self-explanatory; as Glenn Frey sings, &#34;We're gonna saddle up boys, we're gonna ride into town/We're gonna get a little out of control.&#34;  &#34;Tequila Sunrise&#34; and this record's title track &#34;Desperado&#34; were the hits from this album, and &#34;Desperado&#34; has the distinction of being one of the most covered songs in history.  Besides being an Eagles hit, &#34;Desperado&#34; was a pop hit for Linda Ronstadt and a country hit for Clint Black and Johnny Rodriguez.  Pop duo The Carpenters and country music icons Johnny Cash and Kenny Rogers have also recorded the song.  &#34;Desperado&#34; shows the outlaw's dilemma, which the entertainer also faces:  does he continue with his wild life or does he settle down?  &#34;You better let somebody love you before it's too late,&#34; Don Henley sings.<br /><br />&#34;Certain Kind Of Fool&#34; is one of three great songs Randy Meisner came out with while he was an Eagle; the guitar-laced &#34;Too Many Hands&#34; and the Eagles' monster hit &#34;Take It To The Limit&#34; were the others.  Randy likens a guitar to a pistol and the musician's nomadic lifestyle to the outlaw's life on the run.  Both pursuits involve money, and both involve trying to escape, be it from the fans or the lawmen.  As Randy sings, &#34;It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way/It wasn't for the running, but now he's running every day.&#34;  An instrumental version of &#34;Doolin-Dalton&#34; serves as the intro to &#34;Outlaw Man&#34;, which more than any other song captures the essence of the outlaw's and the singer's nomadic life:  &#34;All my friends are strangers, they quickly come and go/All my love's endangered/'Cause I steal hearts and souls.&#34;  Of all the songs on here, &#34;Saturday Night&#34; is my favorite.  The hero is looking back on his life and wonders what happened:  &#34;Whatever happened to Saturday night&#34; when he was in love, things were looking up for him, and his town wasn't a ghost town.  Bernie's song &#34;Bitter Creek&#34; is about the outlaw gang reuniting for one last stand, which could be compared to the singer getting his band together for one last tour.  &#34;We can walk right in and steal 'em blind/All that money/No more running.&#34;  In the &#34;Doolin-Dalton/Desperado&#34; reprise, the protagonist is finally reaping the consequences of his choices:  &#34;Four men ride out and only three ride back&#34; and &#34;Your twisted fate has found you out and it's finally turned the table/Stolen your dreams and paid you with regret.&#34;  The outlaw dies in a shootout, and the singer he represents dies from any number of causes(drug overdose, murder, and so on).<br /><br />Desperado shows the Eagles at their most cohesive level.  All the guys sang lead on at least one song and shared in the songwriting.  The only song on here not written by an Eagle was &#34;Outlaw Man&#34;, composed by David Blue.  On &#34;Doolin-Dalton&#34; the band got help from a couple of solid singer-songwriters:  Jackson Browne, who co-wrote the Eagles' hit &#34;Take It Easy&#34;, and John David Souther, who collaborated on such Eagles hits as &#34;Best Of My Love&#34;, &#34;New Kid In Town&#34;, and &#34;Heartache Tonight&#34; and had his own hit in '79 with &#34;You're Only Lonely&#34;.  Although the Eagles' record sales climbed when Joe Walsh replaced Bernie Leadon in the band, I think the band lost something when Bernie left.  Though Joe is an accomplished guitarist, singer and keyboard player, Bernie plays several different instruments well--banjo, guitar, mandolin, and pedal steel guitar--and he plays all of them on this record.  Bernie also is an extremely gifted singer-songwriter; while an Eagle, in addition to the songs he contributed to Desperado, he wrote &#34;Train Leaves Here This Morning&#34;, &#34;My Man&#34;, &#34;I Wish You Peace&#34;, and, with bandmate Don Henley, the hit &#34;Witchy Woman&#34;, on which he played lead guitar.  All of these songs are great numbers.  Though their music is still popular, the Eagles have never quite filled the void Bernie left when he departed.  Also, once Bernie left and was replaced by Joe, I think the Eagles became more of a Henley-Walsh dominated group and less of a team.  Hotel California and The Long Run, though they're great records, feature Don singing lead on most of the tracks and Joe playing guitar and/or keyboard on practically every song.  By contrast, Desperado features the Eagles working together as a group and has a bunch of songs with a common theme.  For that reason I think it deserves every bit of praise it has gotten.ll the guys sang lead on at least one song and shared in the songwriting.

By contrast, Desperado features the Eagles working together as a group and has a bunch of songs with a common theme.  For that reason I think it deserves every bit of praise it has gotten.

0307454541|1.0|Over fifty pages into this book and I was still uninterested.  Pages and pages of backstory before the book gets mildly interesting, but by then I had lost the will to keep plodding through and keep track of the convoluted story and all of its characters.  I also don't find it entertaining to read about sexual deviancy or sexual violence towards women, and I found those parts of the book so disturbing it made me wonder about the author.  The mystery wasn't all that interesting, and I was extremely disappointed in this book, having just finished a novel that was so intriguing I found it difficult to put down (Shutter Island).<br /><br />I wish I had read the negative reviews before picking up this \\"bestseller\\".  Then I would have known this was one to miss.
0060920084|4.0|As has been noted well over 200 times here, this work is the account of a rather lengthy road trip Bryson took covering 38 of our states.  Now Bryson is one of those writers you either like or you dislike.  As we can tell by some of the reviews here, he does have a way about him, or at least his writing dose, that sort of rubs some people the wrong way. Even though I am a fan of this particular author and count some of his more recent work among my favorite reads, I can understand perfectly the hostility of some readers.  This is particularly true with this account of his journey where he tried to recapture the feeling and essence of some of the places he had visited with his family as a young boy, while at the same time trying to find his \\"perfect American town.\\"  Mr. Bryson steps on a lot of toes here.<br /><br />Now as for the good, the bad and the ugly; let's start with the good and work toward the ugly:<br /><br />The Good:  Bill Bryson is a good writer.  He can be a very funny writer.  He is a keen observer and there is no doubt, after reading his more recent works, that he is an excellent researcher.  I found myself snickering and even laughing quite often while reading the book being reviewed here.  Some of his snappy comments on the way we live are truly funny.  We all have at one time or the other had the same thoughts Bryson has had, but he has an excellent way of articulating his.  He is quite skillful at this.  I also enjoyed his critique of various aspects of our society, even though some of his observations were quite painful...truthful, but painful.  A people who cannot laugh at themselves are in big trouble.  An examination of where we have been, where we are, and where we are possibly going as a nation is healthy from time to time.  Bryson is able to give us a bit of a different slant on things and does it quite well.  I know that it is easy to take offense when someone makes fun of your particular area of the country, your culture, your way of life, but after reading this book, you will note that the author does not play favorites...be bashes just about everything he sees and ever one he sees or meets with the same sarcastic and snotty zeal.  This aspect of the book was fun, healthy and enlightening.<br /><br />The Bad:  Whine, whine, whine.  We all have or moments of whining now and then; it is human nature.  Bryson though takes this whining to a new level; almost a nonstop level.  This can be a bit annoying at times.  As an example we learn very quickly that the author does not like the Golden Arches, or any other fast food chain for that matter.  Well neither do I, but it did not take be 36 years to learn to simply shut up about it and go find somewhere else to eat.  It is not like someone is twisting your arm.  Having traveled through almost ever section of the country the author traveled through...several times I might add, I have never one time found myself in a situation where I was forced to eat Big Macs.  Bryson keeps eating them and whining about them...go figure.  This is one example of many, many, many. Good grief, the whine list is endless!<br /><br />At the same time the author is whining about food, he is taking some pretty sharp jabs at groups of people who really have not much control over their situation.  He seems to hate all tourists, all of them being fat, loud and poorly dressed.  He hates all regional accents (more about that under the heading \\"Ugly\\").  He despises all poor people, unemployed people, rich Republicans, Rich Democrats, motels, restraints, monuments, road signs, fat people, old people, and did I mention fat people?  After reading a few pages, I am not at all sure if he is overly fond of his mom and other members of his family.<br /><br />It was almost as if the author had a pre-set notion of where all the ugly places were in American, why they were ugly, and then set out to find them.  While I agree with many of his observations, I can also assure you that there is far more beauty than ugliness in each and every place he visited.  You merely have to look to see it. This most certainly includes the people he seems to have such distain for.<br /><br />The Ugly:  There were a couple of places in the book that truly offended me.  The first was when he tied into the black lady who was running the visitor center in the Deep South and tried to helped him.  He ranted for over a page, making fun of her black southern dialect...really mean spirited of him I thought.  The second time is when he more or less summed up all Native Americans as \\"drunken Indians\\" driving around in trashed out, over sized cars, weaving all over the road.  This was his description of the Native Americans who live on the reservations of the west.  Again, mean and tacky.  I would not want to say it was racist, per se, but it sure sort of smelled like it. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck......!<br /><br />Now there is not much doubt that Bill Bryson is a bit of an elitist.  After reading this and some of his other works, there is not much doubt on that account.  Or might I say a want to be elitist.  That is okay though...everyone has to be something.  But knowing Mr. Bryson's background, I could not help thinking of the main protagonist and narrator of Tobias Wolff's wonderful book [[ASIN:0375701494 Old School]].  It is sort of sad then you think about it. I can see a lot of Bryson in that young man in this story.<br /><br />This is an amusing read on many levels.  I found that as I read it I became more interested in this author's maturing as a writer, this being his first work, and comparing it with the work he is turning out now.<br /><br />The book is okay, just be sure you know what  you are getting into before you start reading it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksvery place he visited.

0340896981|4.0|It is one of the many virtues of this book that it makes the unlikely relationship between Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew somehow believable. She comes from a modest Yorkshire background, is left-wing, sexually reticent when sober (but she is not always sober), had a double first in English and History from Edinburgh University, but then spent her early twenties working unrewardingly, first in fringe left-wing theatre, then in a restaurant. He comes from a classy family, is handsome, spoilt, easy-going, unintellectual, narcissistic, considers the world his oyster, and is bedding lots of women. It is hard to see how they see in each other enough to have a long-lasting relationship. Perhaps neither of them want a permanent commitment - he because he likes to flit, she because she is afraid of getting hurt. Emma is under no illusions about Dexter (he makes no secrets about his affaires), and he has one or two insights about her (but not many).<br /><br />By the time he is in his late twenties, Dexter is in tawdry television programmes and has become a minor celebrity; he has gone to seed and is an alcoholic. Emma at last has a decent job teaching and has become more confident, sexually too. But they phone each other most days, though Emma has another live-in boy friend (a rather pathetic stand-up comic!) and Dexter is as promiscuous as ever.<br /><br />Then at one stage she is so repelled by what he has become that she breaks off contact for a few years (and about time, too, the reader thinks!).<br /><br />He drifts downwards, from failure to failure, rather rapidly. She drifts upwards, slowly but perceptibly, with a success to show at last. If only ....<br /><br />After two or three unsatisfactory relationships, she meets him again. Much has changed for him in the interval (it would be a spoiler if I described it), and the years have had an effect on her, too (ditto). It is a touching chapter. From here on onwards I really must not say any more about the ups and downs that are to follow; but what had been a fairly light-hearted read before becomes increasingly involving. If one has written off Dexter before as a jerk, one begins to think better even of him, at least from time to time.<br /><br />There is a superb passage - rather a key passage for the book - in which Emma reflects on the difference between being in one's turbulent early twenties and in one's calmer late thirties.<br /><br />The chapters are snapshots of what happens on the same day in successive years, beginning in 1988. There can be quite a lot of development between one year and the next, and this is an ingenious device inviting the reader to fill in the interval for him- or herself. It also charts the changes in popular culture and, to a lesser extent, in politics from year to year. That's also very well and unobtrusively done. And Nicholls has an excellent ear for dialogue, an excellent eye for settings, and brings every character (there are great many more than Em and Dex) marvellously to life.had been a fairly light-hearted read before becomes increasingly involving.

1435248244|5.0|I read this series after I read the reviews on Amazon and I was NOT disappointed! This is an excellently written series, easy to follow and you hard to tear yourself away from. I bought the entire set and have read it straight through. It's set 300 years in the future, with interesting adjustments to todays technology mixed with a little Star Trek and Back to the Future. Everything was done just right, never too much of any one thing. I'm looking forward to reading the Midnighter's series, also written by Scott Westerfield, and then I'll probably read the Uglies series again. Loved it!<br /><br />Worth reading! You won't be disappointed!!!
030745455X|4.0|This is a great sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  You get a much more in depth about the actual girl with the tattoo, whereas in the first book, it's not really about her at all.  But again, just like the first book, the content is incredibly disturbing.  I had no idea what the first book was about, except that it was a murder/mystery type book.  I was actually a little horrified at the end of the book, but it was still a thrilling read.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is a great movie.  I really liked it. Jack Black plays a terrific part as the dreamer Po. He's a combination of light hearted, bold and yet uncertain and insecure. A person can really identify with him. Whether your a kid or an adult who's a kid at heart, I think that you will truly like this movie. It's fun and it shows that no matter who you are or what you look like your just as special as the cool kids.

1593080492|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B00337KM2S|5.0|If you rent this, watch it again after a few days.    In the face of the lower ratings others have awarded, I'm giving this one five stars with bells and whistles.     There wasn't a single scene in this film that didn't wholly engross me. As I watched, I kept thinking, good, good, yes, yes... And the plot kept going, and building. There's no doubt in my mind that most of the women I know will hate this film. I hope they'll forgive me (no chance) for saying this, but to me \\"Up in the Air\\" seemed gut-level honest. Maybe it's because at some level the hero's persona came so close to my own. Whatever the reason, I ached when he dared to hope the American dream might be possible for him.      Is there some element that everyone downrating this one is missing? No. What you're seeing in the statistics is a division of the sexes. They hate it, we love it. In my view, this is an excruciatingly human film and it will be a shame if every guy who sees it doesn't take the time to talk about it a little.    Because, like Bergman's silents, this is one of those films you want to watch a second time, and then a third and then a fourth and at last you finally start to see what's really there.     P.S. Whew! Vera Farmiga is hotter than a two dollar pistol in this one, and George Clooney - who was that elderly actress who had the classic punch line, \\"he's no slouch in bed?\\" Well, George has moments when he stops making moon eyes and almost seems natural, and then we can really identify with him.
078322799X|4.0|An entertaining scary film with a unique story line that is a cut above your typical B movie.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Star Trek is IMHO a well executed prequel to the entire story line, both the TV series and the subsequent movies. The movie chronicles the period from the birth of James Kirk to his assumption of command of the Enterprise. If you are a fan you've probably already seen the movie but if not, or have and are just contemplating purchasing, it's worth the price offered here on amazon. I have not seen the DVD version so I cannot speak on the quality or content of that version, however, as you would expect the Blu-ray version offers spectacular HD quality imaging (I generally do not buy movies any more but decided this was worth owning as a benchmark for image quality) as well as a fairly extensive amount of supplemental content, particularly the three disc edition being reviewed (I'm not sure if there is a \\"movie only\\" version available on Blu-ray; to date this three disc set is all I have seen at retail). I originally rented the movie via netflix before buying it so I will offer this foot note, the three disc set may not be available through rental sources. If you want access to all that extra content, you may need to buy this 3 disc edition.
B000KNE0Y4|1.0|My 13 year old daughter saved her money and purchased a Swatch watch on April 12, 2010.    Let me tell you what happened....  After days of agonizing over which watch was perfect, checking online and in various local stores, she chose her watch. This was a big decision. Swatches cost a lot of money, especially when you are a young girl and have been saving for over a year for this watch. My daughter chose one of your metal band watches with a design on the band that was reflected in the watch. (LK258G) She was delighted!!!    12 days later the band on the watch broke.  The design that was attached to the metal band fell off. We tried returning the watch to the store and exchange it for a different style, they refused. They showed us on the fine print that watch bands were not covered by the warranty.  They tried to fix the watch but gluing the piece onto the band with glue marks broke the heart of my daughter.  The watch band no longer bends properly and she is agonizing over when the next piece will fall off.    We have since discovered that a few of her friends' families have purchased the same watch and over a short time span the watch band has lost the colored pieces and the watches are no longer wearable. This style watch obviously has design flaws.    I would like to return this watch and get a credit for another watch. The store refuses to do it.     Buyer beware!

B00371QQ2U|5.0|I really love this movie. It portrays a wonderful period in this nation's history. I know because I was an engineer on Apollo and worked on the Saturn V. I heard Jim Lovell say that Apollo 13 was just an engineering problem. His journey on Apollo 8 was much more important to him and his crew.  He was so disappointed that he never made it to the moon. Tom Hanks was the one so excited by this movie.  That is good because I think it brought home to the American people what a miracle Apollo was. This movie was well done and very accurate. Even ole Gene Krantz was accurately portrayed. If anyone really knew what happened, I don't know what they would think.  No one had heard of Sibrel until 2001. He has no education, is a convicted criminal and drives a  CAB!!  He lives in Nashville. He wants to trick you into buying a very poor video that he created in 2001 and wants gullible people to buy it for $40.00. As P.T. Barnum once said, \\"There is a sucker born every minute.\\" If his claims of 10 years are true then why isn't he a multi-millionaire? National Geographic Society made a series of videos debunking all of Sibrel's claims. They are on YouTube. The last word: Please research everything I have written. There are thousands of books written by Apollo veterans. There were over 400,000 people that worked on Apollo. There are now MILLIONS. In the ensuing 40 years don't you think that there are many family members and descendants alive? My book has sold in 12+ countries and is in the Library of the Smithsonian as well as other libraries. I have Honors Degrees in Mathematics and Astronomy. P.S. He is a coward because he assaults women and senior citizens.  What a liar and con-artist!!  Oh, yeah, if you see any of my reviews with zero votes, it is jackass Sibrel voting \\"no\\" on my reviews. Amazon has caught him doing this 2 times. I wonder how long Amazon will tolerate this behavior?   Look out--you might be next.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I stumbled across Dexter on Netflix and never looked back. It's a wonderful show, with the perfect amount of humor, mystery, and drama.  Has a bit of gore in the crime and killing scenes, but if you can look past that, you'll be addicted.  Dexter is a serial killer who was taught by his cop father to only kill bad people who actually deserve to die.  To complicate matters, he works in the homicide department at the local police station.  Start with watching season one or you'll be confused about plot/characters.... Happy watching!

One of the best books on flash photography I've read. Highly recommended.

B00007LTIL|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" finds the band at the height of their creative powers, writing songs that ended up being among their greatest. Here, as on \\"Working Man's Dead\\", Garcia and company delve into the folksy side of their musical heritage to deliver cuts beyond anything they would be able achieve in the studio either before or after.    Garcia was heavily involved in the production and used extra musicians, such as David Nelson and John Dawson of New Riders Of The Purple Sage, to great effect. A particularly beloved example of this is David Grisman's mandolin playing on \\"Ripple\\". Jerry also adds some pedal steel on \\"Candyman\\" and \\"Sugar Magnolia\\", while Howards Wales plays the piano on \\"Brokedown Palace\\".    Spurred on by co-producer Steve Barncard's love of acoustic music, this record has more beautiful melodies than any other album I can think of. It also contains my all time favorite song, \\"Box Of Rain\\", with the lyric \\"Such a long, long time to be gone, And a short time to be there\\", that perhaps best catches what the Grateful Dead experience was all about. Certainly the band was better known for it's live performances than it's studio material. But this is one Dead record that will no doubt stand the test of time and be considered among the finest releases in rock music history.

B0012GMWCA|4.0|The second of two albums he released in 1992, \\"Lucky Town\\" is head and shoulders above \\"Human Touch.\\" Where \\"Human Touch\\" falters, \\"Lucky Town\\" soars. \\"Human Touch\\" has about four truly great songs, \\"Lucky Town\\" is almost a top to bottom succession of top tier Springsteen songs. The only true flaw is that the backing musicians on the record lack the power of E Street, but aside from that, it's a solid record that holds its own against his more popular records.<br /><br />The first three song alone shatter the notion that Springsteen had lost his touch with \\"Human Touch\\": \\"Better Days,\\" the title song, and \\"Local Hero\\" are three explosive, jovial rockers with Springsteen in fine voice and the lyrics and music meet his standard perfect. \\"Better Days\\" in particular has some of his best and most honest lyrics, and Bruce sings it with amazing force and sincerity. \\"Local Hero\\" is a humorous take on the impact of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" and the baggage of the  icon status he achieved with it.<br /><br />\\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" slows down the pace, a touching love song about commitment and trust. The album version is a little to slight, but Bruce has reinvented many times in concert since then (most notably on the Reunion Tour), and its power and beauty has become far more apparent in those versions.<br /><br />\\"Leap of Faith\\" is a great gospel rocker (with some admittedly semi-blasphemous lyrics) about finding faith in love again, and Bruce has really sang with such apparent joy and mischief in his voice. \\"The Big Muddy\\" is a great song that I admittedly find at odds with the themes present on the rest of the record. It's a song of seedy situations and their dire consequences, which jar with the presence of faith, love and redemption that permeate the rest of the record. Still, it's a great, great song with an outstanding arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Living Proof\\" is beyond words. One of the absolute best songs he's ever written, as good as anything from \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Nebraska.\\" A gutwrenching celebration of the birth of his first son, Evan, delivered with a vocal so raw and passionate it sounds like he's crying tears of joy. This is a far cry from \\"Sherry Darling\\" or \\"Darlington County.\\" This is Bruce coming full circle, finding life's simple pleasures in its most complex and important task (parenthood) and entering a stage of maturity, self reflection and dedication that would imprint itself upon his future works.<br /><br />'Souls of the Departed\\" is, like \\"The Big Muddy,\\" a departure from the majority of the record, a harsh commentary on gang violence in his newfound home of L.A., though Bruce does express fears for the safety of his children in the bridge. The lyrics are a tad trite, but it's still a potent, gritty rocker worthy of The Boss's talents.<br /><br />The gorgeous \\"My Beautiful Reward\\" closes the record on a sombre but upbeat note. His soul is still searching, but he's at ease now with the search. There is some particularly lovely guitar work on this one, and the lyrics are again some of his strongest.<br /><br />\\"Lucky Town\\" is as good a record as most of Springsteen's output, a truly great collection of songs that bristle with soul and passion, sung by a man who knows how to interpret with them.

B000NQRE1E|4.0|This is a movie I can't help but love.  On a lazy day you sneak it out of your collection and enjoy the pure cheesiness, yet granduer of an epic film.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet light up the screen, and I'm secretly hoping that if they do another film the ending won't be so depressing. How about a RomCom? haha.  I'm more than curious to see what they do about the 3-D version coming out in 2012...I feel like I might want to bring scuba gear, a wetsuit, and floaties.  As of right now I'm waiting for the Blue-Ray version because it is one movie I'd be willing to shell out $25 for.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|A completely convincing, complex but unsubtle portrayal of the torturous psychological disintegration of an insomniac.    dr_sasp
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I got a giftcard for Amazon from a brother for my 17th birthday. So I was searching through romance novels for young adults since I'm such a hopelessly pathetic romantic type person.    This book, mostly involving Brittany and Alex, reminded me so much of Greece. Alex like a Greecer, not really, but he has the edge, then Brittany, the rich white girl part of the popular crowd.     There is something about this book where you never want to put it down. At school I was getting impatient wondering what was going to happen next. This book at times was predictable, only about how Brittany and Alex would get together eventually. Other then that the story kept me by surprise. I loved all the Spanglish when it was Alex's chapter, cuz I've been taking Spanish classes for 4 years now, so it was entertaining to actually get insight on insults in Spanish since my Spanish teacher is a hard butt haha.     The first pages of the book I was thinking \\"oh great, Brittany one of the main charaters is a bimbo valley girl that has a low IQ and only cares about her looks. But after I read a few more pages in, I could tell she was different. Then with Alex, I thought he was just a pervert scum bag, but after reading a few pages more into his chapter, he was different.     One can learn a lot about this book. It shows that although people may seem and act a certain way around friends, that's not them. They have a home life too. They have their problems, insecurities as cliche as it sounds. Labels suck. Social groups suck. One is automatically a bimbo snob if they have certain friends or after school activities, or are labeled as a wreckless pothead that pops caps up people's whoolie-whos. It's not right. They are human, they have souls. The thing about this book is that it should that, but in a way that doesn't sound cliche like I'm sounding.     As a reader, I was so attracted to Alex and Brittany's personalities. They both grew as people throughout the story. and the thing that makes melove this book sooooo much, is the fact that the main charecters weren't overemotional, unrational, idiots!!!! I'm so sick of reading books where the charecter, usually a girl, is so pathetic and puts so much pitty on themselves. Like a hopeless damsel in distress that thinks the world revolves around their opinion. But that's not true for this story. These charecters I got to know to a deep level, which is so important in a good story.     When I finished the story, I felt fullfilled, which is also hard to come across in many books. I just let the book soak in. And the epilogue was really cute. I have to get my hands on the sequel asap, although Alex's brother sounds like a beyotch haha.     For those reading this review, trust me. This book is different then those other young adult stories. It has a real feel to it. It's adventurous and as Drew Barrymore would say, it's \\"magical\\" ;)    I finished it in about a week or two, and that's a miracle for someone like me who reads word-for-word. Two of my friends have borrowed it and they both said it's one of their favorite books now. And that's coming from a friend that reads like two books a week, an absolute bookworm. And the other friend who doesn't read. Ever. More into her friends. But she related to this book so much and she said she didn't want to read the book at times cuz she didn't want it to end. Another friend has been asking if she could read it soon.    Brittany is beautiful and has such a generous heart, the relationship with her mentally/physically challenged sister is absolutely touching. And Alejandro is a babe, woowie! He's the protective older brother that risks his life to protect is poor family.     It's a book YOU must read. It's been over a month since I've finished it, and the story always seems to slip through my mind, soaking in the life of the book. It will give you the reader a new perspective you will be thankful to achieve. It's better then Sarah Dessens books imo. Vamos ya!    Kwaheri :)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|\\"The Truth Will Set You Free\\" indeed! This is a very well made, informative documentary detailing a lot of things the food industry magnates do not want you to know. Do you want to know why eating and buying organic are so important? Watch this documentary...
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is an unusual and charming book.  It's written from the perspective of Enzo, a dog with a 'bit of terrier' in him.  Enzo saw a documentary on television that described how dogs who were ready would be reincarnated as a man.  The story follows Enzo and his life with his family: owner Denny, his wife Eve and their daughter.  Although dog lovers will love it for the perspective of Enzo, everyone can get something from this book.  Enzo is the narrator but it's more about family and relationships than it is about dogs.  Denny is an aspiring and upcoming car racing driver and the theme of racing is woven throughout the book.  If you're not a racing fan, don't worry, car racing doesn't overwhelm the book at all.  I'm not particularly interested in car racing but I enjoyed this element of the book, it's well written and provides roundness to the character of Denny.  Denny's loves are his family and his racing and sometimes he struggles to balance them in his life.<br /><br />There are sad moments in the book and even the first chapter had me in tears!  Loss and love are strong themes throughout. You may need to suspend disbelief a little for this book, it depends on how you see dogs.  Enzo is a human in a dog's body and he is highly intelligent and perceptive.  The book is well written and an enjoyable read.  Recommended for dog lovers and anyone who enjoys reading about families and relationships.
B000FA5MUI|5.0|Cat's Cradle is completely amazing. One of Vonnegut's best. Plenty of other reviews will tell you that, though. Just make sure you buy the right edition. As you may have noticed, there are two editions available in the Kindle store- one published by \\"Rosetta Books\\" for $7.19 (the first search result for \\"Cat's Cradle\\" in the store with an orange and white cover) and one for $5.59 (the third result with a blue cover and a picture of a bird cage). While I'm sure any sane person would buy the cheaper edition anyway, if you accidentally buy the more expensive edition like I did you will be thoroughly annoyed. For some reason, when a quotation mark appears mid-line the space before it is deleted and a space after it is added. For example:    We had locked \\"Papa's\\" door  appears as  We had locked\\" Papa's\\" door    While it's easy to figure out most of the time, if you're not paying terribly close attention or if a line is continued from a previous page, it can be hard to tell whether a quote is beginning or ending.     I called customer service and they sorted it out immediately, refunding my money and allowing me to purchase the cheaper, less flawed edition. Service was great, but I didn't realize there was another edition until I was 87% through the book. It wasn't the end of the world, but watch out. I wouldn't download anything else from Rosetta Books either.    In conclusion, buy the cheaper version. You won't be disappointed. Cat's Cradle is great, especially if you're a Vonnegut enthusiast already.
B002VECM72|5.0|EXCELLENT movie! True story brought to the screen with both the reality of life, and the tenderness one would like to see in the best of fictional heart-warmer best sellers (although it is not fiction). Well portrayed by all actors involved. No wonder Sandra Bullock won an Academy Award (it's about time).
B00275EGX8|5.0|Nothing much to be said, the movie won Best Picture and Best Director for valid reasons.
1400052173|5.0|This is an excellent non-fiction book which has tirelessly been researched.  Skloot has written an accessible and highly compassionate book about the story of the woman behind the world's most commonly cultured cells, the HeLa cells.  HeLa cells originated from a black woman called Henrietta Lacks living in Baltimore, USA in the early 1950s.<br /><br />When Henrietta's cancerous cells were removed from her cervix in 1951 the world was a different place with less regulation about ethics and human tissue research.  Henrietta never gave her consent for the use of her cells but still they are one of the most use cell cultures and generate billions of dollars in income for biological, medical and pharmaceutical research.  Meanwhile Henrietta's family have little money to be able to afford their own medical care and for many years they were not even aware that the cancerous cells of their relative lived on beyond her death.<br /><br />The book covers the story of who Henrietta Lacks was, the course of her cancer and the subsequent use of her cells.  At the same time Skloot tells the story of her own journey and how she makes connections with Henrietta's family and exposes the deeper story of medical ethics and the treatment of black patients in 1950s America.  It is a richly detailed book that covers multiple themes that are expertly woven together.<br /><br />While this is an easily accessible book (the science is well explained) that I would recommend to anyone who has any interest in any of the themes in the book, I think it would be of particular benefit to those involved in medicine and medical/biological/pharmaceutical research.  The deeper story of ethics and the people behind the cells is important and this would be an ideal book for anyone involved in human research.  It's a story that needs a wide audience and demonstrates why human ethics is so important.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
0307474275|1.0|I hear this novel has sold over 6,000,000 copies.  Mr. Brown is no doubt pleased, and loses little sleep over the possibility that in six years no one will be reading his blockbuster.  He has his villa on the Riviera, if he wants it.<br /><br />I do not wish to disparage his talents.  Suppose you wish to write such a novel and have in mind several characters.  Character A (a handsome American, by the way)is perhaps the world's leading authority on, say, symbolism.  Character B (beautiful by the way) is a brilliant young French cryptologist.  Character C (incredibly wealthy and charming)is an eccentric old English peer who happens to have spent his entire life studying early Christian exotica, including secret societies and the legend of the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Fate throws them together one dark and stormy night in Europe.  The action is precipitated by character D, a hulking religious albino homicidal maniac who wears a monk's robe and favors barbed wire garters.  He is a (fictitious) postulant in service to Opus Dei (God's work), an arch-conservative semi-secret Catholic sect that is obviously up to no good --desiring, as they do, to crank the wayward church of today back a thousand years or so to when Christians really knew how to suffer. D is not the villain, by the way, and his passion for slaying is excused by the fact that when a kid, other kids teased him about his size and lack of pigmentation.<br /><br />Okay, now you have four highly original characters, and an opening sequence in which, it turns out, several perfectly nice and distinguished old fellows are murdered by the monk.<br /><br />Where do you go now?  Well, in this enlightened age, you know how readers love books that moon religion, and especially if the moon-ee is the once venerable but now scandalized Catholic Church.  But you can't just make stuff up, at least not all of it, so you have to do some hard work called research, or hire someone to do it.  What you dig up does not have to be entirely true, as long as it is interesting, especially if it is a little titillating to one's baser instincts.<br /><br />History being what it is, and humans being who we are, you will discover a number of unsavory truths mixed in with a larger number of equally unsavory untruths, rumors, suspicions, legends, and valid questions.  As a creative person endowed with artistic license, you may crayola some of these tidbits to make them even more delicious, if not salacious. This is called \\"mining the vein of history.\\"<br /><br />If you are diligent and blessed with a certain intelligence, you will, out of this stew of possibles, come up with a substory that is so gripping, so bizarre, so full of lust and corruption that few will not want to hear of it.  More work is ahead, for your true genius is revealed in how you plot the story.  When is \\"fact\\" X, hinted at or revealed, and by whom or what?  Character A knows much, but not enough; enter character B, to complement A's knowledge.  Even the two are still insufficient (although they are falling in love).  Alas, even the vast erudition of C leaves us wanting.  Read on!  Read on!<br /><br />Maybe, dear reader, after I don't know how many hundreds of pages, you get tired of the author's continuously advancing carrot and you flip to the final pages to find the final answer.

B001SS3JS8|5.0|This is not generally a book I probably would have picked up at the store. That being said, I wanted a book to read and was rummaging through my mom's books. She said she hadn't read it yet but enjoyed the other books by Jodi Picoult. The book had my attention pretty quickly. The writing style draws you in and peaks your curiosity about what will happen next and what really happened in the first place. Her story jumps back and forth between the present and the past, painting a full picture of these families and their experiences. At times, after reading a story from the past, I was tempted to jump to the next chapter to finish what happened but then the return to the present drew my attention just as quickly. I agree with the other review which states it leaves you breathless until the very end...when the past and present come together. I read this in 2-3 days...I wanted to know what happened! For a book I didn't necessarily pick out, I enjoyed it immensely.
0385504225|3.0|Liked it but didn't love it....I figured out some of the ending way too early in the book and while there were some good twists and turns, the book was almost all a chase scene....
0060765380|1.0|... in destroying science.    If you thought that Dan Brown maliciously abused history, then you ain't seen nothing yet.    From the beginning to the ending, I was horrified by the abuse of science in this book. With the minor exceptions of what he accurately claims in the back, EVERYTHING in this book is utter and absolute bunkum. Awful, excruciating, painful bunkum. If you know anything about science (like...you know, if you are eight years old and have ever watched the Discovery Channel), you will start to recognize stupidity here.    For example, one of the people in the novel blows up an \\"acid bomb\\" in a limestone cave. Limestone is calcium carbonate. This reacts with acid to form water and carbon dioxide, along with some calcium hydroxides. The entire cave would have been destroyed.    Bacterial transformation by a virus that also infects humans? Stupid and impossible. Check.  Human transformation into higher beings by cyanobacteria? Stupid and impossible. Check    And there is bad writing in addition to bad science.    Overly melodramatic threats against family members? Check.  Insane people with unlimited power who have vague histories and agendas? Check.    Cliche after cliche, bad writing, bad science.    Wow, there is no absolutely NO reason to read this. For anyone. It isn't even entertaining. It is sheer stupidity.    Seriously, how did this man become a veterinarian? I wouldn't let him near a potato, let alone my pet.
0452295548|5.0|I liked very much of this book because it gives important information about our brain.     Some information can be related with our own experience and can be used immediately.     This is nice because you understand that the \\"interior voice\\" of your brain is natural thing and that you can learn to control how you react to situations.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Fantastic, small compact and easy to use. Great results the carbide sets the edge and ceramic for polishing to a razor sharp edge! the diamond rod is a nice extra and its tapered shape makes sharpening serrations a snap. Cannot recommend this more a must for any knife owner!
B002ZG9846|5.0|This film is an absolute scream. Hit Girl is one of the greatest characters ever created. The soundtrack is brilliant too. It's a fun film but it's also a little unconventional, which might irritate some people. You can't really stick it in any one genre. It should be a kids film but it's not, and thank goodness for that.  Funny and moving in places this is well worth a watch.

B000F8O35U|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1989 variation of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is easily one of the best modern animated films from the studio.  With the voice talents of Jodi Benson, Kenneth Mars, and Rene Auberjonois,(albeit in a small yet memorable role as a French chef named Louis), it is fantastic.<br /><br />It opens its story, appropriately enough, at sea.  The ubiquitous underwater sequences never feel strained or cheap, but exciting and even organic in a fanciful way.  The story's pivotal shipwreck at sea is appropriately huge and chilling.  Additionally, the songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are brilliant.  Indispensable to the story, they include \\"Part Of Your World,\\" \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls,\\" and \\"Under The Sea,\\" which won an Academy Award for Best Song at the Oscars ceremony in 1990.<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is still great fun, executed with a creative assurance that like many of its forebears, it will be appreciated for many years.
1400052173|4.0|I bought this book for my Amazon Kindle probably because I was brought up in a medical family, and I knew it would have interested my recently deceased father.  I used to purchase books for him to read that had a medical theme - mainly Civil War-era medicine and medical thrillers, and I certainly would have bought this book for him as I knew that cervical cancer was of great interest to him.  However I did purchase the book from Amazon for my own gynecologist, and I have recommended it to several readers. This is a must-read book for any inquiring woman - and aren't we all?

B002GHHHG0|5.0|Creepshow is one the greatest Horror Anthology Movies ever made. A Horror Movie with Stephen King, George A. Romero, and Tom Savini, is a horror fans all time dream. 5 Stories all rolled into one flick that happens to be a tribute to all the horror comics of their youth. All five stories are amazing and definitely act like a live action comic book. The kid with the voodoo doll is just a book end, that is telling the viewer that their are more on the way. I was told to stay away from the sequels because their are three stories made in each one instead of five or more. Stay away from the sequels and stick with the first.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|excellent very satisfied  the first dvd i received was defective, i contacted the seller and they quickly sent me another dvd and it works great. i was very impressed with this company

B00012QLQ4|5.0|Akira kicked the door down for anime to be accepted by the world. The voice over actors associated with the movie had their careers take off with success and respect by the world. I Highly recommend everyone watch it or own this movie. Every anime fan should know about Akira, it is a anime classic.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is one of the best I have ever watched.  Great story based on a real life story.  A good watch for anyone!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Excellent and up until this time of year 2010 it is one of the better fantasy series out there, the books are not bad either.  The special effects are good, season 2 even gets better due to the addition of another female cast member that travels with them named KARA.  The Mord'Sith are a female creation of warrior pain-torture experts and she becomes a run away rouge from her sister clan.  I have not seen this concept on TV too often, they are introduced in season 1.  They also have the Sisters of Light and Dark later in season 2.  Season 1 has Richard the Seeker, Zed the grandfather wizard of the 1st order, Kara the mother confessor, Raul the ruler, and several Mord' Sith.  The adventures become fun right away when Richard is forced to leave his home and take up responsibility against Raul his brother ruler and the Ruler of the Underworld also.  They do show the underworld in this series.  It reminds me of some Greek Myths like something Hercules or Perseus would have to do.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|ABC has finally brought a classic comedy to TV. Being a big Married With Children fan back in the day, the main interest I had for this show was the return of the wonderful Ed'o'Neill. Then the reviews started coming in and everyone was stumbling all over themselves on how good a show it was. While Ed was still a big interest, my passion for the show as a whole grew with each rave review that came along. I'm so glad I caught the pilot, because I saw a show that made me laugh out, had great, individual characters, and was also a show filled with real sweetness. I don't know about any of you, but I have already seen a number of moments in this series that mirrored my own. It was almost as if someone in the family was giving stories to the writers. If you know the show, then you know how great it is. If you are a newbie, then let's dig in and get the details....    Modern Family centers around three different families. We begin with Jay Pritchett, the family patriarch, and Jay is married to a beautiful(and much younger than he)woman named Gloria, who is Columbian. Gloria has an 11 year old son named Manny(Rico Rodriguez). Then there is Jay's daughter Claire(Julie Bowen), who is married to Phil(Ty Burrell), a doting father who wants to be a \\"cool dad\\" and \\"one of the gang\\" to his and Claire's 3 kids, daughters Haley and Alex, and son Luke. Phil works, while Claire runs things at home. And lastly, we have Jay's son Mitchell(Jay Tyler Ferguson), and his boyfriend Cameron(Eric Stonestreet). Mitchell is a lawyer, and Cameron stays home to take care of Lily, the baby they have just adopted. The trials and tribulations of this family and how they sometimes interwove and connect is wonderful. The Pilot episode set it up nicely and made it seem like it was just a documentary on three different families who weren't related, but then brings it all together in the end. Brilliant.     \\"Modern Family\\" is a single camera, documentary-style sitcom, like \\"The Office\\", with cameras following the every day lives and events of these people, and the characters speaking to the camera as if being interviewed. By this time, I had been getting kind of tired of this format, but the show is so great and the docu-style format just works wonderfully for the show. But everything works wonderfully for the show. Created by Steven Levant and Christopher Lloyd, who brought us \\"Frasier\\" and \\"Just Shoot Me\\", the show is rich in mining humor from the different types of families on display here. The older guy with the hot wife and young son, the typical family with the 3 kids and white picket fence, and the gay relationship who have just adopted a baby. But nothing would be able to happen if it weren't for the writing and incredible actors to bring it to life. MF is pitch perfect in it's casting. Everyone fits their roles to a T. Every single one of them is interesting, fully developed, and all have their moments to shine. At times, it really feels like you are following real people. Every one here is a stand out, but attention must go to Eric Stonestreet as Cameron, who is a real treasure of a find, and Ty Burrell as Phil. Each character acts and reacts like they are related, and the humor can be absolutely knee slapping hysterical. The writing on the show comes from a lot of real life moments and incidents in the lives of the show's writers and producers, and it feels like this could of really come from someplace. Like I said earlier, I've come across moments from my own life and family.     What are some of the episodes you'll get here?. The \\"Pilot\\", as I've already mentioned, is a great introduction to the series that ties it all together in the end and makes sense. Other notable episodes here include \\"The Bicycle Thief\\", where Phil tries to teach Luke a lesson and steals his bicycle, only to bring back the wrong bike. \\"The Incident\\" is a classic that has Shelley Long guest starring as the mother, Jay's ex-wife, who re-appears after making a scene at Jay and Gloria's wedding. Shelley is still a sharp and brilliant comedienne. Want to see Cameron dress up as his favorite clown?. You will in \\"Fizbo\\". \\"Undeck The Halls\\" is a hilarious and warm Christmas episode about Phil and Claire threatening to take Christmas away from the kids and then realizing that they have to start being serious about their threats. Benjamin Bratt shows up as Manny's father in \\"Up All Night\\". Jay and Cameron have an uncomfortable encounter in the gym locker room in \\"Moon Landing\\". Phil and Claire try some role playing to hilarious results in \\"My Funky Valentine\\", which also features comedian David Brenner. For those of you into the ipad, you have \\"Game Changer\\", which isn't a favorite of mine. There, of course, is plenty more.    \\"Modern Family\\" gives hope that there can still be good comedy on TV. One of the great things about this show is that even when it isn't a strong episode, it still entertains and has memorable quotes and dialogue. There's something in every episode. For a TV fan like myself who is completely bored with there being so much of the same on the tube, Modern Family came along like a breath of fresh air. It's hysterical, touching, and brilliantly written and acted. Become part of this destined to be classic family now!.

Wonderful story.
0316017922|5.0|After Tipping Point and Blink we have another great book.    Central tesis: inteligence is important for sucess. But only until one point. From that point it is also (if not most important) the environment (I would call it Luck).    I do not agree 100%, but it is very well done and I'm almost convinced. I'm at 80-something %, maybe with 'What the Dog Saw' I completely change my mind.    If you like Italian Culture, the first chapter about Rosetto is a must.
0316113506|4.0|If it wasn't already obvious that exercise is good for you then this book will demonstrate how it is also good for the brain. The book is loaded with lots of details about exactly how exercise stimulates and maintains our brains. It also details how to train to achieve optimal brain functionality.<br /><br />The book contains plenty of medical evidence (the author being a doctor and all) that certainly adds a good deal of credibility to something that seems very obvious. The chapters cover a range of ailments and how exercise has been shown to overcome them. Even though some activity is better than no activity (which is the norm these days) the book demonstrates how you must push yourself physically to get the most from the grey matter between your ears. This is probably the hard part but the benefits seem well worth it.<br /><br />Generally the book is a good read but there is plenty of medical terminology mixed in which can make it a bit hard to follow. However, if you did want to really investigate the processes detailed here then it seems that the specific mentioned in the book are a great place to start any research.<br /><br />Although the thesis of the book can be summed up in one simple common sense phrase for those that are interesting in understand better how the brain works and how it responds to physical activity then this book is a recommended read.

0307358658|5.0|Reason for Reading: Next published in the series (in English).<br /><br />A woman disappears and a few months earlier Inspector Harry Hole had received a threatening note. He is convinced that their is a connection. Then a second woman disappears. Harry and his detectives soon discover a disturbing tale of women, married with children, who have gone missing without a trace over a chillingly large number of years. The clues will take him down so many false roads that his job is on the line not once, but twice.<br /><br />This is a thriller that takes off on new twists with the speediness of a whip crack. What's up for one chapter is down the next with reveal after reveal sending the police on the chase of a clever, determined serial killer who is skillfully directing the police to play into the unsub's own mad theatre of his mind.<br /><br />I've read three of the books in this series so far and this is the most excellent. The red herrings, the false roads which all do connect, in a way, just not the way the police want them to, are an amazing road to follow. Twist after turn will have you gasping as they go after who they think is the killer only to find they have suspicions of someone else ... more than once. I really can't convey how amazingly clever this plot was woven together, with a myriad of clues, characters and evidence Nesbo doesn't miss a step in seamlessly creating an airtight thriller.<br /><br />Funny thing for me is that I guessed who the killer was as soon as the character was introduced, for no particular reason than I thought it would make perfect sense in the end. (Perhaps I read so many thrillers I'm beginning to think like a thriller writer, either that or a serial killer, AAH!). Anyway, it gave me a unique perspective reading this book as I watched my chosen killer and applied all evidence and clues to them and convinced myself I'd picked correctly not that far into the book; that I was actually rather stunned, even though I'd been right, when the narrator out-of-the-blue starts writing from the killer's point of view letting the reader know who is the killer.<br /><br />An extremely intelligent, clever, roller-coaster of a thriller. Jo Nesbo is up there at the top with the best thriller writers of today.rts writing from the killer's point of view letting the reader know who is the killer.

0307460444|5.0|I picked up a copy this week and have already tried the peanut butter and chocolate cupcakes.  It was super easy to make and turned out great!  I did have to bake 5 minutes less than the estimated cook time.      I like that there are plenty of cupcakes to try and tons of decorating ideas.  I'm excited to try the s'more recipe and the lavender recipe!  Don't be swayed by the negative reviews.  It's great if you want one book that has everything from the basics to more advanced decorating ideas.
0307454541|5.0|I was told to read the book before seeing the movie, so I ordered the book. When it arrived, I was not sure if I could finish it in time. However afer the first chapter I could not put the book down. If you like mystery, this is a book for you. Of course, I don't like a book that throws too many names around as I could not keep track of them. However I soon realized that I did not need to. So a very engaging book to read and I am read to order the other two books from this author.
0962477060|5.0|I concur enthusiastically with all the positive reviews I've seen about Fretboard logic.  After decades of playing by ear I've been studying theory and am finding it a tedious and boring process.    However, there are three tools I've used to help immensely - putting it all together so I can see \\"why\\" and just \\"How.\\"   Fretboard Logic is worth it's weight in gold.  So is Chord Wheel (available on Amazon)- a visual and very useful tool based upon the circle of fifths (in one direction) and fourths in the other.  The two together would make a guitarist out of a chimpanzee!    And finally - David Walliman's excellent videos on Youtube - he was there when I needed him, especially for understanding how to use modes.    Please note - I'm a bass player. For years I've kept an old Telecaster laying around and played it on occassion but lately, due to these learning aides, I'm starting to sound like I have clue when I pick up the six string! Frankly, I'm having a blast  (and oddly enough - it's helped my bass playing as well).
B000002VC5|4.0|Before Styx's \\"Kilroy Was Here\\", there was \\"I Robot\\", the second album from The Alan Parsons Project.  It was originally released in June of 1977, after the Project had received a bit of notice with their debut album, \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\".  While the album is often linked with Asimov's book \\"I, Robot\\", due to rights issues the link is limited to the general theme and the similar name.    The album opens with the instrumental title piece \\"I Robot\\", and is the longest track on the album.  The piece builds well and is a good and strong lead into the album.  \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" is another strong number which worked as a single.  \\"Some Other Time\\" is another very strong piece, though sandwiched between two pieces which receive much more play on the radio I think it is often forgotten.  \\"Breakdown\\" is an outstanding number which for me is the highlight of the album.  \\"Don't Let It Show\\" slows things down and is another single release from the album.  It was also covered by Pat Benatar on \\"In the Heat of the Night\\".     The second half of the album opens with \\"The Voice\\", an interesting piece which is perhaps just a cut below those in the first half of the album, but still interesting and it fits well, and has a wonderful instrumental bridge section.  \\"Nucleus\\" is the first of three instrumentals on the second half of the album, and while it is an enjoyable diverting piece, it is not a highlight for me.  \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" is the last of the singles from the album.  Another nice piece, but not strong enough to hold up the second half of the album when compared with the first.  \\"Total Eclipse\\" is the one piece on the album not written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson.  It is an instrumental piece with voices being used as an instrument, written by Andrew Powell it is one of the more interesting and attention grabbing moments on the album.  \\"Total Eclipse\\" leads well into \\"Genesis CH.1, V.32\\", the beautiful instrumental piece which closes the album.    \\"I Robot\\" remains one of my favorite albums from The Alan Parsons Project\\".  The group is led by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, though there are several others who appear on numerous albums from the group, such as David Paton (bass), Ian Bairnson (guitars).  They are also known for using numerous vocalists, and this album is no exception.  Lenny Zakatek handles the vocals on \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\", Peter Straker and Jaki Whitren are the vocalists on \\"Some Other Time\\", Allan Clarke is the vocalist on \\"Breakdown\\", Dave Townsend is the lead on \\"Don't Let It Show\\", Steve Harley is the lead vocal on \\"The Voice\\", and Jack Harris is the vocalists on \\"Day After Day\\".  There is also a remastered version of the album which includes five bonus tracks.  I have not heard that version so I cannot comment on it.

0385751893|4.0|This novel is one of my 13yo daughter's set readings in her Year 8 English studies. She asked me to read it so as I could assist her in her forthcoming essays surrounding the book.    The story moves quickly and has many of the excesses and brutalities of the Holocaust either removed or simply not mentioned, and is strewn with factual inaccuracy. But while many other reviewers look upon these omissions and inaccuracies as detracting to the novel, remember this - the novel wasn't written for adults. I tried to look at the book through my daughter's eyes as I became engrossed on the story of young Bruno and his move from his lavish lifestyle in Berlin to a strange new place in the far flung reaches that he couldn't quite understand, the people he meets, both on his side of the fence and that of his new friend, Schmuel, and the shock ending that author Boyne places before us.      The novel provokes many questions, as indeed I think it is meant to - all up an excellent choice in a curriculum at that year level.
B0016PM722|1.0|The Hasbro ForceFX lightsabers SUCK compared to authentic Master Replicas.  I got one Hasbro blade (Dooku) and I will never get another.  The blade wobbles, the sound effects are weak and garbled, and there is a SEAM along the hilt of the blade.    Compared to my Master Replica blades, this thing looks like crap.  I don't even keep it next to my originals.  The finish is dull and mottled by comparison.    Don't bother.  Save your money and find an authentic Master Replica blade on Ebay.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of the show Friends.  A local TV station plays reruns Monday-Friday, and I never miss.  I had seasons 1 and 10 on DVD, but this year, with my bonus, I treated myself to the entire 10 seasons set.  I love the case the set came in - so nicely organized, and each DVD individually wrapped in plastic.
0307346617|5.0|I would would hope you know the format of the book at this point: anecdotal post outbreak interviews with people in the trenches. It is damn well done, and the authors perceptions of how different countries/groups would handle the outbreak are similar enough to mine that I felt glee rather than objections to infeasible responses.    This book is to Zombie books what District 9 is to \\"alien species on your back doorstep\\" movies, with the human condition across a range of cultures/systems being the primary focus. Zombies are just a plot device.
0061703257|4.0|If you enjoy eerie suspense then you will like this book. It feels like a modern day Alfred Hitchcock. Very heavy on the suspense with tones of creepiness and deep mystery.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I saw a trailer for the movie and I always try and read a book first before seeing it's movie. The movie trailer made it look like the book was going to be a gory, slasher, horror film and I was ready to keep the light on at night after reading.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out the BOOK is not filled with gore and blood. There is a big difference between eerie and slasher and Shutter Island, the book, was eerie.<br /><br />I don't want to write much about the storyline because it is a mystery and I wouldn't want to spoil the mystery for anyone. So all I am going to say is that if you enjoy a good mystery and like books that engage you as a reader, then this is a great choice.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet, but based on the trailer, I think it will be drastically different than the book...in a good way.
B001HN69B8|5.0|Is this really a 5-star movie? No. But then neither is Brazil and I gave that movie 5 stars, too. Why? As he does with Brazil and 12 Monkeys (but fails to do in many other films that don't quite work), in The Imaginarium Gilliam finds fertile ground for his bizarrely psycho-delic brand of theater (and historical commentary). The ideas are rich (with ample room for the unexpected), the sets and visual acrobatics are delightfully strange and the acting is very good. Christopher Plummer is marvelous, Heath Ledger is chimerical and Tom Waits is, well, downright diabolical. Here's a looking glass worth going through.
0061730327|3.0|This book gets off to a very slow and laborious start. For the reader, it is a difficult book. Most the book is difficult to read as it seems to go off an frequent tangents. Toward the end, the story collases into a compelling story which is the real focus of the book.<br /><br />The Bou Who Harnessed the Wind is certaily a worthwhile book as a coming of age story and certainly a biography of the author. In all fairness English is the author's second language. The book does not indicate if the author wrote it in English or if it was translated.<br /><br />Keeping the original author's intentions versus editing for the benefit of the reader is a delicate balance. That said, there the book would have benefited from a significant edit to focus on the main story. If you can force yourself through the first 2/3 of the book, the compelling story is at the end -- and it's a worthwhile read.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for young readers. Two of my children, who are tinkerers themselves, struggled to read the book, but like me found it very aimless in the beginning. If you've looking for a nice casual read, i would not recommend the book. But if you really want a first hand account of a true life struggle, in the not perfect -- but compelling words of a young man who was persistent and later rewarded -- you will enjoy this book.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie seemed to me to be a faster, action version of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. All the action in the Life Aquatic is here and more so. This was a better film then Zissou but still had the quirkiness of Anderson films that seem to often illustrate the funny \\"male bonding in it's awkwardness\\" and the classic titles along the top of the screen for every scene. I saw this with my dad, nieces, and siblings and quite a few times we were all rolling with laughter. I'd recommend it for families.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am really glad that I watched this as it showed Michael Jackson was more than ready to present the shows in London and that rehearsals were very well under way. He knew what he wanted but always treated those around him with respect when asking for it. It is a shame that the press did not do the same. I am so pleased to have seen this video and to remember Michael how he really was instead of the warped and cynical picture painted by the press.
B0036B8MZU|5.0|First, a disclaimer. I don't get TV reception. I watched this show over Netflix. Thank you Starz and Netflix for making this available to those of us who do not get TV reception.    The show is based on historical fact, but above all it is entertainment. And what entertainment it is!    Spartacus: Blood and Sand is brought to you by the Xena dream team with Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert as producers and starring Lucy Lawless. John Hannah is the only other well-known actor. Andy Whitfield, Manu Bennet and Viva Bianca are all newcomers. Whether they are veterans or newcomers, this is a terrific ensemble cast. The writing, overseen by Stephen de Knight (also a producer), is dynamic, poetic, and brilliant. The first two episodes were directed by Rick Jacobson with other episodes directed by Michael Hurst, both from Xena and Hercules. Other directors fill in the rest of the season. Although Michael Hurst stands out as the best director, there wasn't a dud among them.     The entire show is shot on a soundstage against a green screen. The CGI is occasionally not up to snuff, but the content of the show overcomes any deficit in the CGI department. The first two episodes, which established back story for Spartacus, were probably the weakest of the series. By episode three, when Lucretia and Batiatus (Lucy Lawless and John Hannah) make their appearance, things start rolling. Viva Bianca creates the character Ilithyia, the woman you love to hate. The scenes between Lawless and Bianca are fabulous and get better as the series progresses.    There is something for everyone: blood, violence, sex, nudity and most of all intrigue. I highly recommend the show, this is the best thing on TV, and possibly the best thing ever on TV. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will beg for more when you hit episode 13.
B000UG78NG|1.0|Started off interesting, with pretty good character development.  Over the course of the book, however, there seemed to be a complete change in direction.  It seemed like the author suddenly looked around and said \\"Wow, that Harry Potter thing is really making money. Let me completely change my book mid stream and center it on a magic school...\\"  The flawed, likable protagonist from the first half turned into an arrogant jerk who was immediately great at everything, no matter how difficult or if he had ever experienced it before.  This coupled with an irritating female love interest (who sets back strong female characters in fantasy writing at least 20 years) completely soured the rest of the book for me.  Actually threw it away in disgust 10 pages before the end.  What a waste.
0061537934|5.0|My daughter gave me this book because she loved it so much.  She was right, as usual!  And I am not a dog lover.  Never had a dog and probably never will, but this book transcends that fact.  But if you are a dog lover, this book is for you.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is pretty much exactly like the other Ice Age movie I watched a couple years ago- incredibly exciting animations, a constant flow of humor and creativity, and a distinct amount of craziness and whackiness to every single one of the talkative forest critters in the woods, haha.    What makes the Ice Age series so wonderful is that *all* the characters are memorable, not just a select few.  These animated animals travel through rivers, down dangerous paths, fall down steep cliffs, ride through volcanos and waterfalls... this is actually some of the prettiest animation I've ever seen, second only to the Simpsons I suppose.    Anyway, the story in this film is about the sloth character who discovers dinosaur eggs, and when they hatch, he wants to mother them.   Of course \\"you know who\\" doesn't want that to happen (the mother dinosaur) and from there, the adventure of a lifetime takes place.    I still believe adults can enjoy these type of movies just as much as children.  You don't have to buy these kind of films for children only.     I was laughing the entire time, and I believe you will too.  That is, if you share a love for animated comedies the same way I do.  Even when you're not laughing, you'll be so amazed by the neverending creative aspect of the storytelling that you won't bother caring about anything else.  A flawless film.
0446563048|5.0|This is an awesome book because Zappos is an awesome company. Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos)is one clever guy. He is also smart to have figured out that making customers happy is how you make your business successful.  That in and of itself is not that brilliant or new, but what he acutally put into place was to create a business culture that invests in three key areas: customer services, culture, and employee training. There is his brillance - he has figured out what the most value asset of the company is and strives to make it better.  That asset would be his employees.  Humans are important to Zappos.      The book has lots of great tips on building this culture.  What questions to ask potential employees.  It also gives some insight to the company training program which encourages employees to constrantly grow and develop. Funny how many companies worry that they will waste money training people that will just leave.  This is true because they missed the happiness factor.  Make your employees happy and they will be more productive and stay with you. Novel idea.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|James Cameron ought to get a one-way ticket to the planet of blue idiots whom he seems to love so much. Typical Demo Rat blather about mankind's terrible ways and how great the native peoples are.      A visually stimulating movie ruined by a puerile liberal message.  Plot was mundane and the acting not much to speak of.    Yeah, right, a bunch of savages defeats a mega-capitalistic universe jumping civilization.  Plausible James.  And Titantic sucked too.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Well I guess it had to happen sooner or later; one of my favorite bands has called it a day and released what they have said will be their last album.  I should be thankful that they have stuck at it as long as they have done, and I am.  Yet I am also a bit disappointed as in my opinion this is undoubtedly one the best albums the Scorpions have ever recorded, and one fans have hoped they would make for many years.  When they've nailed it like this you hope that a band will go on and repeat it, but these guys have said they know this album is good and so they want to go out on top of their game.  Fair call.<br /><br />What makes this album so good is the songs.  The quality of musicianship and production has never been an issue with these guys, always first rate.  But albums have sometimes been quite inconsistent, with some excellent tracks but sometimes some clunkers too.  But no clunkers here.  As you would expect there are the usual few power ballads, but in general this album rocks like the Scorps haven't done in years.  To me this album sounds like Unbreakable (2005) & Humanity Hour 1 (2007) meets Love At First Sting (1984) and Blackout (1982).  It has a real old school 80's rock/metal sound so typical of the Scorpions in that decade, but mixed with the more modern sound of their last two albums.  So the result of old meets new is perfect metal music for the new millennium for old school fans like me.<br /><br />The opener Raised On Rock kicks things off with a bang.  It is their Rock You Like A Hurricane for the new millennium. And when the first line is \\"I was born in a hurricane, nothing to lose and everything to gain\\" the link to the past is indisputable.  This song is pretty simple in its structure but it is extremely effective, packing a great punch and an infectious riff and rhythm.  No doubt it will be regarded as a Scorpions classic.  But then comes the title track, which they have apparently been playing to open their live shows recently.  Faster paced with a great grove, some distorted gruff vocals and killer riffing, I love it.  It's the perfect mix of old meets new, and another absolute classic.  If I can be critical of it at all it would be to say that the song doesn't go for long enough.  I really get into it and then at 3:13 it's over, but I reckon the grove should have been kept up for at least another minute.<br /><br />Slave Me at number three is a slower paced rocker and is even shorter at 2:45 but it still hits hard.  Then at track four we get the first power ballad in The Good Die Young but no soppy love lyrics here, it's about the war in the Middle East (so maybe it actually isn't a ballad but just a slower song?)  This is another of the albums best songs and I rate it the equal of any Scoprs power ballad.  No Limit and Rock Zone follow, two more great rockers followed by the power ballad Lorelei.  I don't mind this song, it isn't bad and the intro reminds me of the great Send Me An Angel from 1990's Crazy World album.  But they have done better before.  Turn Me On follows and this is another great rocker which is one of my favorites.  After this the album falls away a little with the next couple of songs.  Lets Rock (curiously not on the U.S. version of the album) is okay but earlier rockers are better.  Sly is an okay power ballad, but nothing great, probably the weakest song on the album in my opinion.  Spirit Of Rock isn't a bad song either, but doesn't reach the heights of earlier rockers.  The Best Is Yet To Come is the power ballad to close the album, but again it's a good one.  A bit of love in this one, but only about living a life of rock and roll.  It also has an opening which reminds me of the ballads on Crazy World, and I can see this as a song the crowd sing along with and wave cigarette lighters to.  A great way to close the album.<br /><br />So here we have it: lots of great riffs, lots of energy, and great production, but they key to success here is consistency plus the Scorps sounding true to their classic sound of the past yet fresh at the same time.  Not much more the fans could want from a bands last album.und of the past yet fresh at the same time.  Not much more the fans could want from a bands last album.
0307454541|2.0|I first heard of this book and it's rave reviews on NPR.  A few weeks later I'm working out of town and I see this book as I'm checking out of the grocery store.  I don't read much and years ago when I was in college one of my professors told me I had and 8th grade writing level.  That's my background, now back to the review.  I found this story somewhat interesting.  After reading 200 pages it got too dark and sadistic and I wish I'd thrown the book away then instead of finishing it.  The author wants the reader to be aware of womens abuse but his writing seems to glorify it.  I felt like I needed to give my mind a bath each time I put the book down.  Oh yes and there is sex, sex, and more sex.  It seems everybody having sex is OK with everybody else have sex with same partner.  The endings were no surprise for me.  I guess Salander filling her pockets at the end was a bit surprise.  When I bought the book I knew it was Trilogy and I was really hoping it would be good reading.  As it turns out I won't be reading any more of the series.  I rate this book 2 stars and I feel I'm being quite generous.
B002VECM6S|1.0|I watched this movie with some anticipation, only to be left with a feeling of being somehow cheated by it.  It is far from being a classic, and I think that once the initial wave of enthusiasm is over, it will be soon forgotten.    I also realised something about Sandra Bullock and wonder how it came to pass that she was awarded an Oscar for this film.  It hit me that when I see one of her movies, it's not Sandra's character in the film- it's Sandra.  The same thing happened with many actors, John Wayne, Jack Lemmon, etc.  Here, it's just Sandra with blonde hair and an accent pretending to be a rich socialite.    The movie itself is predictable and way too long.  It may have been heartwarming to some, but you can anticipate the plot turns almost at every corner.     At least the DVD wasn't too expensive.
0393072231|5.0|This is a good lesson on the insularity of the world of financial institutions.  Figuring out what was happenening early was done by an interesting cast of characters who, because of their particular backgrounds, eccentricities and uniquenesses as individuals, were on the outer margins of the consensus-driven institutions which co-participated in running the economy into the ditch.<br /><br />The people depicted in Lewis' book are fascinating and it's a reminder that the best insight into what is going on will not come from those comfortably ensconsed in a particular field or industry.  It will come from outsider/contrarian types who, because of their uncontaminated perspective and freedom from group-think, will be able to see both the forest and the trees.<br /><br />Also, the folks who figured the whole thing out early were skeptics.  In this age of simplistic corporate bromides and platitudes, skepticism, sadly,  has fallen into disfavor.<br /><br />Read this book and you'll be wiser about how large groups of people persist in doing nonsensical things and you'll be less likely to get caught up in them yourself.
0780623703|1.0|It was after watching a cable special about Don Knotts (i.e., good old Barney Pfeiff) that I wanted to check out his last movie.  In this truly dopey social commentary, two modern youths - Tobey Maguire & Reese Witherspoon - are transported into a 1950s TV show, ostensibly gracing the 1950s landscape with post Sexual Revolution wisdom.     Some thoughts from author Mary Beth Bonacci are particularly apropos:   *\\"Before the Sexual Revolution, sex just wasn't discussed.  It was a taboo subject in polite society.  Often this was taken to extremes.  Parents didn't talk to their kids about sexuality.  Television shows depicted married couples sleeping in twin beds....  *\\"Ever since then, the Western World has been imbued with the notion that it's healthy to 'let it all out,' to 'put it all on the table'....We don't refrain from discussing sex because it's dirty.  We refrain from discussing sex because sex is sacred.  Our culture can't grasp that, because we have no sense of the sacred.  To be sacred means to be 'set apart,' set aside in a place of honor\\"  (Mary Beth Bonacci, Restoring the Sacredness of Sex, 4/10/2006)    I am guessing that the \\"Pleasantville\\" TV show depicted inside the movie is set some time around 1957.  As per the Centers for Disease Control, 340,687 cases of STDs were reported by state health departments in 1957 <[...]>.     Currently, \\"The CDC estimates that 19 million new [STD] infections occur each year, almost half of them among young people ages 15 to 24\\" <[...]>.  Be sure to get this clear.  As per the CDC's numbers, there are now 56 times more NEW STD infections EACH YEAR, than there were OVERALL STD infections in 1957.    OK, ok Pleasantville creators - It was odd for 1950s TV to depict married couples as occupants of twin beds.  Ha, ha, ha.  Very cleaver.  Yet, you made no genuine attempt to explore whether there were treasures which have been lost from that era.
B00006DEF9|5.0|- Lina Lamont (after being kissed by her leading man in a scene): \\"Oh, Donny, you couldn't kiss me like that and not mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.\\"<br />- Don Lockwood: \\"Meet the greatest actor in the world. I'd rather kiss a tarantula!\\"<br />- Lina: \\"Oh, you don't mean that.\\"<br />- Don: \\"I don't... hey, Joe, bring me a tarantula!\\"<br /><br />As much as it pains me to admit it - primarily because Fred Astaire is my favorite hoofer - Gene Kelly's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN probably is the finest musical ever put on cinema with, in my opinion, THE WEST SIDE STORY and Astaire's TOP HAT and THE BAND WAGON just coming up short. Set in the early days of Hollywood, just as movies were transitioning from silent to talkies, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN deserves all the good, good rep it's garnered down the decades. It features marvelous dancing and singing and, damn, it's so funny. The sequence featuring a preview showing of THE DUELLING CAVALIER (\\"100% All Talkie\\"), as technical difficulties get the better of the poor picture, is hands down one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen - \\"No! No! No!\\" \\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\\" Not to mention, the sly digs at the film industry are as timely and on-point today as they were back in 1952. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and, for whatever reason, LES GIRLS, are my two favorite Gene Kelly flicks.<br /><br />Gene Kelly stars, co-directs, and choreographs. But it's not all about Gene Kelly. Other folks have a hand in. Donald O'Connor matches Kelly tap for tap as the wiseacre sidekick Cosmo Brown and he provides one of the film's best moments in the slapsticky and marvelously physical musical number \\"Make 'Em Laugh.\\" Debbie Reynolds, perky Miss Burbank of 1948 and still a teenager when this film was made, exudes freshness and a sort of girl-next-door sexy that makes even jumping out of a cake seem wholesome.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jean Hagen hijacks scenes and submits possibly the best dumb blonde performance I've ever seen (sorry, Judy Holliday). Hagen is brilliant as self-absorbed silent film siren Lina Lamont whose screechy, nerve-jangling voice doesn't bode well for her next feature picture which is currently being converted into a talking picture. Her adoring fans, of course, had never heard her speak in public before. Lina's constant leading man Don Lockwood (Kelly) despises her and fears that the upcoming talkie - featuring Lina's voice - will sink his career. But then Don's former song-and-dance partner, Cosmo, comes up with a dilly of an idea...<br /><br />\\"Dignity, always dignity\\" is Don Lockwood's response when interviewed about his life. In a gala opening of one of his movies, Don recounts his \\"dignified\\" backstory to the adoring public, even as the accompanying flashbacks give the lie to all that dignity. What this sequence accomplishes is to let you in right away that the tone would be very much tongue-in-cheek and breezy and even a tad subversive.<br /><br />You look at what Kelly and O'Connor do in this movie and you marvel at the athleticism and sheer fitness level mustered up. About this movie I could toss all sorts of superlatives at the wall, and most of them will stick. There's a joyous energy present throughout, and a sense of grace and high-spiritedness and spontaneity. There's the tight and witty screenplay. And for period buffs, the painstaking recreation of time and place. Kelly and the crew worked their tails off to ensure historical authenticity. And if you're a movie buff, this is a homage to the golden age of cinema... and a wicked bursting of bubbles. Old song standards are dusted off and reinterpreted, and I'm particularly digging the exuberance of the musical performances in \\"Fit as a Fiddle (And Ready for Love),\\" in O'Connor's dynamic \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" and in \\"Good Morning\\" and the title song itself, and the lotsa fun \\"Moses Supposes\\" (really the only original song here).<br /><br />This is the 2-Disc Special Edtion and its loaded bonus features are by themselves worth the money: alternatingaudio commentary with Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Kathleen Freeman, Co-Director Stanley Donen, Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Filmmaker Baz Luhrmann and Author/Film Historian Rudy Behlmer; 2 documentaries: \\"What A Glorious Feeling\\" (35 minutes, hosted by Debbie Reynolds as she fondly looks back at the film) and \\"Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM\\" (a focus on producer/song lyricist Arthur Freed's film works; 86 minutes); excerpts of 12 Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown songs from the originating movies (including Ukelele Ike's rendition of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" from THE HOLLYWOOD REVUE OF 1929); the deleted \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\" outtake (4 minutes) as Kathy Selden (Reynolds' character) serenades a billboard of Don Lockwood's; \\"Scoring Session Music Cues\\" - original recordings of the songs in the movie, including multiple takes and material either dropped or revised in the final film; a list of the awards the film won; a listing of the film's cast & crew; \\"Singin' Inspirations\\" is a pretty awesome option which, if prompted, will play additional hidden footage and feed you more fun facts about the film; \\"Reel Sound\\" is a brief text feature which touches on \\"several major transitional films made as the silent era turned to sound\\" (mentions THE JAZZ SINGER and THE BROADWAY MELODY); the theatrical trailer; and a Stills Gallery.<br /><br />To top it all off SINGIN' IN THE RAIN looks visually stunning, being a vibrant technicolor extravaganza from MGM. Or as Kathy Selden describes Don Lockwood in his wardrobe: \\"You looked so dazzling in your green knickers, yellow sweater, and orange beret.\\" I guess, another way to put it is like this: Dignity, always dignity.

B000S0GYRU|1.0|I saw all the good reviews of this movie and bought it full price. It should be a crime to sell a movie that high that is that bad. I really like occult/supernatural films.....this isn't one of them. I was really disappointed. I guess there is no reason to read the reviews anymore since I apparently view things differently than the majority of customers that reviewed this movie. Choose to buy at your own risk....I think I will recycle mine as a coaster.
B003BVK2ZS|5.0|I just finished The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession. I loved it. It was a very quick read because of the compeling story. Ms. Bartlett takes on the story of an unapolgetic book thief. She gives us glimpses into the fascinating world of rare and collectable books. That part makes me want to run out and find a book shop to browse through. She also gives us a view into the twisted psychology of the thief and the efforts of those who work hard to thwart his efforts. Some of the one star reviews slam her for glorifying the thief, but they appear to have too much connection to the industry to appreciate a balanced story. I did not see Gilkey as a hero or even worthy of any kind of respect. I did gain some respect for Sanders who has helped protect(s) an industry I would love to know more about. Bartlett gives us glimpses of the history of book collecting and collectors. It appears that rabid collectors may not be too many steps away from being a thief and she explores this.<br /><br />I recommend it for  quick interesting read.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I've been a fan of Megadeth since I was about 12-13, I remember getting Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction way back in the day, and then getting Peace Sells and So Far, So Good...So What! too, and have always been a huge fan of those albums, but I feel after Youthanasia they started losing their edge, and it started coming back with The System Has Failed, while a solid album, just not groundbreaking, the same could be said for United Abominations, a solid album, but still not quite back yet.    Here in 2010, after finally getting the album, I've wanted it since it came out, but no store had it here, I live in a ghost town, anyways, after finally getting the album, I am very pleased to say that Megadeth has returned and are back to Take No Prisoners, you start the album with 'Dialectic Chaos' and right off, the first thing you're thinking, is this thrashy Megadeth (yet still containing the melodic value as well)? YES, THIS IS A THRASH METAL ALBUM, this is what I've been waiting for really since Countdown to Extinction.    I'd go into more detail, but I have to get going, if you've been waiting for Megadeth for about 20 years to release another thrash album, then this is your album, this is melodic thrash at it's best, right up there with the new Heathen, which is awesome as well.

B00382X4XC|5.0|After listening to Heaven and Hell proper (disc 1), I can safely say that it is the most vinyl sounding cd version. When I purchased my Japanese SHM version, the description said that it was mastered from Direct Stream Digital which is used for SACD production. The sound is very warm and has tons of air. I also took the time to analyze the wave-forms in GoldWave and there is no clipping anywhere to be found. I ran EVERY single song, as well. Disc 2 (especially the 1st 2 live songs) obviously is not sourced from the highest quality tapes and there are sonic deficiencies, but certainly not do to with compression or mastering errors. It sounds more like a decent bootleg, but very entertaining as the performances seem to be sonically unmolested, for the most part. Very raw and real. The Lady Evil mono edit is a blast. More direct and in your face. It causes me to wonder why there is a mono version of that song? Maybe a demo of some kind recorded on equipment with only that capability, maybe? Still awesome. The remaining Hartford identified live cuts are sonically better than the 1st two and reveal a band that sound great without anything masking them. Strongly recommended!
B0030MM68O|1.0|I'm amazed & dumbfounded that this film was chosen against Avatar. Granted, Avatar was predictable, & a rip-off on a few different pix. This film is deeply troubled, though. The scenarios are often unrealistic as Heck. The actions of the main characters often aren't explained. There really isn't nearly enough character development. I wasn't sitting here making notes as I watched. Nor do I feel like writing a lengthy review. This film just doesn't work. It appears to be an elaborate device to show a character type (Adrenaline Junkie). Throw in an inferred male-bashing message w/it, & you've got the film. I don't think this director/writer/whatever she is, has much of an idea about military ops, or most who serve. This flawed project makes one think she was too arrogant to ask for knowledgeable advisers. I'm all for supporting our guys in uniform. To me, this film disrespects them. There are plenty of women who are very knowledgeable on these topics. Cameron's Ex definitely is not one of them. She should have figured that out before blowing the studio's money on this thing. It will not stand the test of time. As evidence of that. Here I just rented it for the weekend, for only $1.99. Not even a year out, & it already isn't selling...

B001HN69B8|3.0|I have mixed feelings about rating Imaginarium. The art direction and visual appearance of the film are indeed impressive, making for a good blu ray experience. The set designs were intricate and magnificent, the overall color look was muted and not garish, somewhat reminiscent of Sweeney Todd. The cast is star studded, particularly with the unplanned addition of Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell, which made the performances diverse and more interesting. Heath Ledger's performance, in his last film, was very good as was Chritopher Plummer's  However, this will not be remembered as Ledger's great career performance; Batman and the earlier Brokeback Mountain are his seminal great performances. The storyline was a bit disjointed, and never congealed for me. I fully admit that I am not a huge fan of Terry Gilliam's past works, and frankly, listening to him on the Special Edition features and the film commentary are, for me, like watching paint dry. I usually like the unexpected, and the weird in Cinema; in fact I gravitate towards the art house style of Cinema. This film, however, suffers from the ultimate criticism: it was dull and boring. Sorry, and my apologies to Terry Gilliam fans, of which there are many.
0736092269|5.0|So much has been said about the strengths of this fantastic book so I will point out what it doesn't contain or could do better. First, this is not a book that you can use to directly create a workout plan. For each body part featured, there are descriptions of the muscle in the group and how they work together, the major variations between body types and how that affects one's ability to do certain exercises, and brief coverage on injury prevention and recovery. There are several exercises described and illustrated for each muscle group.<br /><br />The reader does not come away with a plan to do certain exercises in a certain order, on certain days or in combination with certain other body parts. Thus a novice will not be told (for example) to start his chest workout with dumbbell presses and then move to barbell and machines as the chest muscles are exhausted. Nor will you be instructed to exercise triceps after chest so that the triceps muscles are not depleted prior to doing chest. Finally, this is not a book that discusses diet, sleep, nutrition or supplements, all of which are critical factors to achieving your strength training goals.<br /><br />This book is an outstanding linkage between human anatomy and exercise physiology. It describes what mechanical difference and muscular impact of doing different exercises (say, squats vs. leg presses) so that the reader can understand how a given exercise works the muscles. It is up to the reader to infer based on this understanding how an exercise routine should be constructed or how to overcome or compensate for limitations in the reader's existing training regiment or personal physical characteristics.<br /><br />As for what could be better, with each exercise, there is a color legend to explain which muscle groups are engaged. This should be abandoned for until you memorize the 20 or so colors (assuming you can distinguish between them) you have to keep paging back to the legend to just ignore them. It would be far better to simply list the muscle groups as text. I would also like to see larger versions of the small diagrams that show the corresponding muscle groups shaded in red and orange. However, these are small gripes and the ineffectiveness of some of these graphics are overcome when by the detailed text and large labeled muscle charts.ist the muscle groups as text.

B0035V35P8|4.0|This movie is surprisingly good - it somehow manages to combine both massive amounts of blood, rather too much actually, with the beauty of martial arts which as always, done right, is like a dance.  Rain, who plays the hero of this show, is excellent!
B0010ZR160|5.0|Absolutely a moving story. The cast was perfect. It was a story that leaves you questioning yourself. \\"What would I have done?\\" I personally don't think I could answer that question unless I actually went through something like that. I must say, the film was not what I expected at all. Its a must watch. Sad that many of the issues that take place in this film are a part of our real world. Some scenes are hard to watch but at the same time it sure brings the emotion to the film.

It is sufficient to recall their  acclaimed masterworks: \\"Barton Fink\\", \\"Man, Who Was Not Here,\\" \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" Therefore it is extremely interesting to see their takes on the \\"Jewish question\\" in their two latest movies. They made a screen version of «The Yiddish Policemen's Union» (after the Pulitzer Prize author Michael Chabon's novel which had become a bestseller). The film action takes place on Alaska where the Jewish autonomy is being formed after the defeat of Israel in its war for independence.  The new film \\"A Serious Man\\" (In Israel it was renamed \\"A Good Jew\\") is  about American Jews--mathematicians, rabbis, lawyers, dentists and eccentrics, men and women, children and adults. This is a movie full of grotesque -each character makes us laugh until our stomachs ache. Laughter simply did not leave the audience. But the end was unexpectedly grim. (There is a lot of funny things in life, but little merrymaking.)The ending was harsh, and the leaving crowd was completely bewildered and discontent.This motion picture does not make sense,  what did  the directors mean after all? Someone told a joke about a woman confiding to a friend, « Yesterday Haim rushed in and raped me...What did he want to say by this act?» Incidentally, during the viewing the real life conflict took place among movie-goers. (It added some new shades to what was happening on thescreen.)  Behind an older couple a younger couple was sitting, they were over forty --I did not notice much younger people in the theater-- and they huddled close to each other, and they giggled and chewed their smelly popcorn, smacking and  crunching. The mustachioed man in the front, with a shaved head--apparently of the \\"Russian\\" origin-- turned around in anger many times, until the one who chomped stinky popcorn, asked, «What? What don't you like here?» The \\"Russian\\" got upset and said in Hebrew: \\"Ma-ma, ata mafra, which means «What-what, you a nuisance!). \\"What, said the local guy, in Russia you cannot have popcorn?\\" The \\"Russian\\" got seemingly excited trying to say that he hated smells in general, but it was something like: you like this hellish smell, but I do not like it. After this the local guy rose up, but the \\"Russian\\", even though he was twenty years older, had an imposing frame, and stood higher than a small and nimble local guy who had a cleanly shaven skull too ( widespread fashion). The tsk-tsk ensued from all sides, and the incident fizzled out-- the local guy moved to the other end, no problem, since the theater was half empty.   So what did directors (they are also the screen writers) intend to say? I myself got puzzled at first.  The plot goes like that. Professor of mathematics, forty-five and a good man-- brought up in the atmosphere of resisting evil-- lives in a cottage with his own exemplary wife full of energy and his two teenage children. One boy is turning 13 and he is preparing for his bar-mitzvah. The main character's brother also resides in the house; he is a lonely man, kind of eccentric and ill-adapted to real life. The house is full of shouting matches and conflicts-- between children, between the professor's daughter and her uncle, who occupies the bathroom for hours; between husband and wife (the film begins with her informing her spouse-- his absent-mindedness befits a professor of mathematics-- that she's leaving him for hisbest friend whose wife just died. Conflicts in the life of the professor arise on the whole \\"perimeter\\": it seems to  him that the anti-Semitic neighbor wants to grab part of professor's land and his Korean student is blackmailing him, slipping to him an envelope with money and demanding a higher grade;  his son, instead of studying Hebrew, listens to pop music and smokes marijuana; the brother does not want to move out doodling his  notebooks with Kabbalistic signs, gets  hysterical, and--in the end--turns out to be  a secret gambler and a pedophile. Professor's wife evicts his brother and places him at a motel, temporarily, until the professor grants her the divorce according to all the religious rules. There is also a neighbor -- femme fatale-- who is tanning on her lawn naked and tries to lure the tormented Jew into her trap. The \\"good Jew's\\" head is spinning from the conflicts, and from those who are trying to help him: lawyers, rabbis, and \\"friends.\\" His dreams are nightmares: a femme fatale rapes him, dentists poke in his teeth, the anti-Semitic neighbor together with his son armed with a sniper rifle are on a hunt for him and his brother. After the numerous setbacks and suffering our inspired and triumphant professor became an apotheosis writing on a huge board, filled with scribbled mathematical signs, \\"the formula of uncertainty.\\"     Yet somehow everything falls into line--his friend who tries to steal the goodly wife dies in a car accident; a stoned boy manages to pass a bar mitzvah ceremony and becomes a \\"responsible Jew.» At his workplace, our hero, yielding to blackmail, coughs up a higher grade for the persistent Korean and receives a desired tenure. And here the tale has to end ... But then comes \\"rude\\" ending: the hero receives a  phone call from his doctor about the lethal illness; and his son with classmates leaving a Jewish school, and enjoying the strong wind, sees a darkening sky and the approaching tornado ...   The Homeric laughter is being replaced with a dark prophecy. This «unhappy end» configures the entire film differently. Suddenly you realize that among all this whirlwind of Jewish characters there is not a single person, causing sympathy. On the contrary, they cause extreme irritation. No, not because they are all \\"bad\\", evil, treacherous, cruel, but because they are rather stupid, naive and hypocritical, while taking care of their strictly material interests and their kindness smacks of the lack of will. Their existence is kind of mechanical, meaningless, as if by inertia only. Their marionette looks, their   «frazzle» are ridiculous, and so familiar ... And the \\"elders\\" of the tribe, teachers and rabbis seem to be out of their minds. But the main and the most frightening thing is-- they are all, without exception-- empty! Of course the film is made with humor, but it is an evil, black humor, very similar to mockery. It contrasts sharply with the Jewish humor of Woody Allen. More than that, it seems to me that there is some \\"controversy\\" with Woody Allen, some polemics with him. Woody Allen's humor and his approach to people, Jews and Gentiles, are kinder and more tolerant to people treating them as mischievous kids, and Woody's final note is always festive; life is a holiday, a stupid one, but a happy holiday. The brothers Coen's humor is cruel, ruthless, evil-- in all their films and in this one-- in particular. If this film were not made by the Jews, it could be called an anti-Semitic one. So, perhaps, it's a film on self-hatred? Aren't many individuals among Jews nowadays who hate and despise their tribe?  Not the case, since the Coen brothers are «betrayed» by their harshness (theirs is a bitter humor), hoarseness and nearly despair that they embarrassingly hide in the cobwebs of the \\"Jewish humor\\". They are too serious! Bitterness and hopelessness lead to anger and apocalyptic prophetic rage. They seemed to say: this world is not worthy of life. They predict its annihilation. Forthem any \\"good\\" Jew is a dead Jew.
B0038VPB5W|1.0|The album falls short. This album is such a disappointment that I can only listen to 2 songs and I am already tired of them. It seems like Bullet for My Valentine is trying to reach a different audience or maybe trying to get more radio play as this album will truly bring on the 10-14 year old girls who read twilight all day. I think they just killed the core of their fans who loved The Poison. This album sounds like a modern day release from Motley Crue. Musical repetition from a handful of tracks that sound too much alike.    Screaming -- Gone. No Angst  Production -- Where is it? Robotic synthesizer voice? Awesome job there...  Melodies -- To much 80's Hair Style sounds for a modern day metal fan. Musically repetitive and soft.  Lyrics -- Should have had his wife sing them. Sounds nothing like prior material and is truly lacking. It's like this guy got hit with a bottle of love potion #9.  Solo's -- Weak compared to prior material. Where are the shreds and riffs???    Is the talent gone? I truly hope not. Is this an experiment? I truly hope so.  I'm already missing the hardcore sounds, screams and total chaos and madness that they used to bring on stage. Hope they don't plan on playing this material at something like the Mayhem Festival. It will never fly with those crowds..
0393072231|4.0|Let me get this out of the way first: I could hardly put this book down. Very informative, and reads almost like a novel. But while it was well researched, it was not well written. Lewis never bothers with pronoun antecedents. Usually the reader can figure this out from the context of the paragraph, but not always.    Other problems as well are words are frequently missing, or not the correct usage. My guess is that the editors and proof readers submitted this book to a spell checker, then pronounced it ready to publish. My high school English teacher would have flunked me for this mess. For such an interesting and thoroughly researched book, it deserved a far better effort from Norton.
1594488878|4.0|I've loved all of Nick Hornby's books, and figured it would be no different with this one. Then I started reading, and it was slow. I was disappointed, but I stuck with it and my patience was rewarded. Keep reading. The book is not about what it appears to be about in the early pages. It's a much richer tale, more poignant, more compelling than the opening. The end will stick with you and make you pause. Once again, Hornby creates very believable characters full of faults.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|So, why call it Sherlock Holmes?     Just because you put a story in the same location as the original, and use the same names as the original characters does not mean it is the same story. Bearing little resemblance or feel to any type of Holmes story, this film takes on the same path of many comic book action films, where the dastardly villain (in this case,          Lord Blackwood) and our hero ( Sherlock Holmes) battle it out till the very end. The movie, on its own merits, might have passed as just another shallow, stupid, yet entertaining and brainless popcorn action flick with cute, witty lines, and enough over-the-top and predictable action to please and enthrall masses. It is just the flick that screams: \\"Sequel.\\" Being called Sherlock Holmes, it becomes the lowest denominator in a long line of Holmes films, and personifies the lackluster, superficial direction films have taken lately when trying to recreate a story or film.     The \\"political license\\" taken by the director in characterizing Holmes and Watson is ridiculous. The duo, being billed as almost equals, really kills any credibility from the get-go. For one thing, they are almost the same age and seem act more like college buddies than sleuths. Watson is no longer a wise sidekick of Holmes, but more of the \\"cool\\" buddy that Holmes can exchange rivalries and squabbles with. Why not just have Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing the roles?  Or how about Mel Gibson and Dannie Glover? The director/producer seemed to miss the point that Holmes deduction was methodical and insightful, not just some psychic prediction used to impress others. Watson, as a trusty veteran to Holmes' deduction, respects the value of Holmes' smarts, and the interest in a case. Here, their camaraderie takes on the role of more of a \\"buddy action film\\". There are glimpses occasionally of Holmes' insight, but these moments are seldom.     Not only that, but the suspense of a typical Holmes story is stripped away, and inserted withedginess or gimmicks to try to cater to masses. We have the quick moving camera shots a la The Matrix or Fight Club. We have the mandatory romantic interest of Holmes and Irene Adler to give some \\"depth\\" to the story. We have the usual hero-villain dialogue exchanges, and the battle to the end finish.  Like we didn't see that coming from a mile away.     I guess if there is anything to be positive about, it is the fact that Robert Downey Jr. has proven he can take on many roles, and does have charisma and personality. He does a moderate job as Holmes, and, if given a better script, it might have been a memorable performance. However, there really was not much there, and the plot, other than Holmes trying to stop Blackwood, was an incoherent mess.     Some may say that the directors and producers have some license to \\"reinvent\\" the story any way they want. Well, yeah, I guess that is so. You could also have a remake of Jaws, and make it about a shark that escapes hunters and needs to reunite with his shark family. That probably wouldn't go so well, would it? The bottom line is that license to reinvent only goes so far.     The old adage rings forth again: sometimes it's just better to read the stories.

0800141660|4.0|For being a motion picture and not a miniseries, this 1994 adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is quite good. It does eliminate many scenes, some characters, and alters certain minor elements of plot. However, Thompson does so in probably the most practical manner possible to maintain the overall integrity of the major story: Elinor and Marianne's romances. For people who claim the plot is boring, my only response is (1) that it isn't particularly Austen but (2) it is very interesting for individuals who have never read the novel, so much so that Thompson won an academy award for best screenplay.<br /><br />One other point: some people might consider Thompson too old to play 19-20 year old Elinor Dashwood. From the cover of the DVD case, I'll allow you to make that decision for yourself.<br /><br />Finally, if you are an Austen afficiando and you desire to know exactly where and how the film deviates from the novel, I have provided the following summary. If you have not read \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" at least once in its entirety, what follows will not assist you. Also, what follows reveals certain plot details.<br /><br />Changes:<br />Margaret is 11 years old rather than 13.<br />Colonel Brandon is named Colonel Christopher Brandon.<br />Lucy Steele has no sister.<br />Willoughby does not visit Marianne at the Palmers when she is ill.<br />Mrs. Ferrars (i.e. Edward's mother) is never physically shown in the film.<br /><br />Below is a list of changes from the novel. One may assume that items not mentioned as having been changed accurately follow the novel.<br /><br />Mrs. John Dashwood has no children.<br /><br />Mrs. John Dashwood is not as manipulative of her husband as in the novel. She does not properly assist him in lowering and lowering what he plans to do for the Dashwood sisters. (In fact, Mrs. John Dashwood is portrayed as very selfish and rather stupid.)<br /><br />Edward Ferrar's behavior is a little too romantic for the period. Also, Edward almost tells Elinor of his prior engagement to Lucy but then is called away by his mother to London.<br /><br />Barton Cottage is a bit too large and fine, although this is not too obvious.<br /><br />Sir John Middleton has no wife and children.<br /><br />Mrs. Jennings does not ask Marianne to play a song after Marianne has just finished playing the same song.<br /><br />Mrs. Jennings talks to Elinor about Brandon's past love life - details Brandon is supposed to provide at a later date.<br /><br />Willoughby's behavior is also more modernized then it should be. At times, he behaves exceedingly childish and rude (more so than the novel would permit).<br /><br />Lucy Steele does not arrive with her sister to Barton Park. In this film, Lucy has no sister.<br /><br />Lucy does not confide her engagement secret to Elinor outside Barton Cottage but after a diner party at Barton Party.<br /><br />Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings AND the Palmers, since in the film, they ALL travel to London at the same time.<br /><br />Mrs. Jennings, Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne travel to London together. There is not evidence of Marianne being quiet/pensive on the trip because so little time is spent on the carriage ride from Barton Cottage to London. (This also mitigates, in the mind of the viewer, the very long distance between Barton Cottage and London.)<br /><br />[Time between arriving at London and the ball where Marianne sees Willoughby is very minimal.]<br /><br />The ball scene does not show Mrs. John Dashwood's treatment of favoritism toward Lucy at the expense of Elinor.<br /><br />Miss Williams is given the first name of Beth.<br /><br />Elinor tells Marianne about Willoughby's sexual escapades with Beth (i.e. Miss Williams) immediately after learning of them from Colonel Brandon, rather than waiting until the very end of the novel.<br /><br />Lucy returns from the John Dashwood family (where she was a guest) to see Elinor. While Elinor and Lucy are talking, Edward arrives. Instead of Elinor going to fetch Marianne, Marianne, herself, enters. They are only together for a matter of moments before Edward claims he has to leave to perform an errand on Fanny's behalf. Lucy accompanies him.<br /><br />Lucy, herself, tells Mrs. John Dashwood of her love for Edward Ferrars after Mrs. Dashwood claims Lucy is going to marry well.<br /><br />Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he wishes to give the Dellaford living to Edward. However, this conversation takes place outdoors and is very short. Also, Mrs. Jennings is not present to misunderstand their conversation.<br /><br />When the party goes to the Palmers country residence, Mrs. Jennings remains behind.<br /><br />[Time between Willoughby's cruel letter and trip to the Palmers does not adequately show Marianne's decline in health.]<br /><br />When Marianne wanders around outside the Palmers during a thunderstorm, she actually walks across fields, all the way to Willoughby's estate. While looking down upon the estate, she quotes Shakespeare's sonnet, \\"Love is not love which alters...\\"<br /><br />Marianne falls ill and is brought back to the Palmers by Colonel Brandon.<br /><br />Mrs. Palmer is hysterical when Dr. Harris says that Marianne's fever is infectious and that she should remove her baby from the house.<br /><br />Willoughby does NOT visit the Palmers during Marianne's illness to justify his behavior. He doesn't appear at all.<br /><br />Immediately after Colonel Brandon arrives with Mrs. Dashwood to Marianne's bedside, the scene shifts back to Barton Cottage where Colonel Brandon is reading poetry to Marianne, who is still recovering her strength.<br /><br />Colonel Brandon gives Marianne a small piano for Barton Cottage.<br /><br />A double marriage occurs at the same time between Colonel Brandon and Marianne Dashwood & Edward Ferrars and Elinor Dashwood.<br /><br />Scene with Willoughby looking down upon the cottage - seems to be with an air of regret.<br /><br />Film ends with Colonel Brandon throwing handfuls of coins into the air for the villages (and others) who came to help celebrate his marriage to Marianne Dashwood.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />While I have pointed out basically everything that I completely diehard literalist might find uncharacteristic, this film is certainly NOT a bad one. While absolute literalists might prefer the Davies' adaptation of 2008, I certain recommend this adaptation as worthy or watching. Even Austen literalists should be able to appreciate this work, even though, like me, they might make of list (either literally or mentally) of all the changes.he has to leave to perform an errand on Fanny's behalf.

B000NA28I4|1.0|NOTE: This review contains major spoilers<br /><br />Seeing as how the original novel by Christopher Paolini is the worst novel I have ever read (for now), I became curious as how the movie adaptation fared out. Critics panned the movie for obviously being a LOTR/Star Wars ripoff, and audiences disliked it for being unfaithful to the source material. Despite all the criticisms, however, I saw the movie, anyway. Now, I've seen some really bad films in my life, such as Battlefield Earth, The Hot Chick, Chicken Little, and so forth. \\"Eragon\\" is.....well, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's worse than the movies I've just mentioned, but I'll explain.<br /><br />First, I will say the film does have some nice scenery and a couple of decent special effects shots (the flight sequence, for example). But it all ends there as the rest of the movie fails to achieve greatness in many ways. The story, much like the book, is heavily borrowed from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even The Wheel of Time (The Spine, anyone?). While the movie is notably different from the book, you can still spot the clich&eacute;s from beginning to end. I mentioned in my written review for the original novel that the author basically recycles one of the oldest fantasy formulas ever known (average villager leaves home, goes on a quest, delves into his family history, becomes a great warrior, etc.) and adds nothing that's new to the genre. Well, the evidence in the movie is still strong if you observe closely. The mentor trains our main hero to become a great swordsman, that's a clich&eacute;. The mean heroine is pretty much a damsel in distress, that's another clich&eacute;. Our main hero is revealed to be the Chosen One, that's the most obvious clich&eacute;. You know, I find it interesting that in many fantasy stories, there's just one person who is destined to restore peace and destroy evil forever. Why not a trio of heroes, or a quintet? Well, anyway, the plot is pretty much riddled with clich&eacute;s, and adds nothing new to the fantasy genre. The movie itself is basically one of the most simplistic fantasy films ever created. And you might argue that this is just a family film. Well, families aren't stupid.<br /><br />And if you think the story is bad, you haven't examined the character of Eragon (Ed Speleers). One of the biggest problems I had with the book was the main character: his personality was disorganized, and his chemistry with the other characters were very awkward (Arya, for example). Nothing is changed. The Eragon that we see in the film is the same handsome boy who embraces the same exaggerated nobility and becomes the same savior of the human race. The arrogance in the character is also shown in the middle of the film when he confronts Brom (Jeremy Irons); he acts like a grownup before and after he realizes that Brom used to be a dragon rider himself. In fact, the entire race of the Varden seems hopeless until Eragon enters the picture. In addition, I've noticed that Eragon's clothes are remarkably clean for a villager. When he's living in Carvahall, his clothes look like they come from a prince compared to everyone else. Did he just buy his own washing machine or something? So basically, there are many things wrong about this character. I mean, here's a kid who enters a fort to save Arya (Sienna Guillory), and no one is aware that he is about to rescue one of their own prisoners. The guards must be idiots. And what's worse, he doesn't even get hurt when he escapes. Not a scratch. The guards must REALLY be idiots. And Durza (Robert Carlyle), one of the main antagonists in the story, can't even break this kid's finger. HE must be an idiot. And Brom is the only one who is fatally injured. He's.....pretty lucky to be killed off in a movie like this. To be quite honest, Eragon is one of the oddest characters I have ever seen in a movie. This so-called average villager finds a blue-colored egg in the woods and he is not the least bit shocked that it hatches and out pops a baby dragon. He just smiles. Like an idiot. He's an idiot. Then, he has high hopes for becoming a dragon rider, and yet he doesn't think of the dangers that he would face. Can't he just pose for GQ or something? And THEN, he wants to rescue Arya, and he thinks that he can take on dozens of people with only a sword and a limited use of magic. The guards are still idiots, but not as idiotic as Eragon.<br /><br />And do they really expect us to believe that Eragon can learn to become a dragon rider in such a short time? And learn a different language in such a short time? And fall in love with an unknown elf who looks old enough to be his mother?<br /><br />Incredible.<br /><br />But we're not going to stop there. There are other things about this movie that can make you lose your appetite.  The dialogue is cheesy and poorly written. The music is horribly overblown. John Malkovitch as Galbatorix is an embarrassment, complete with a terrible attempt at a foreign accent. Ed Speleers as Eragon is a terrible bore, and he isn't trying hard enough to actually act (granted, this IS his first starring role in a movie, so I guess that's the reason why). Rachael Weisz's voice is inappropriate for Saphira as her lightweight tone doesn't mix with the character's strong-minded personality. The sexual innuendo is pretty obvious (this is rated PG, right?). The special effects are bland; nothing special comes out of it. The action scenes are dull. What have I left out? Oh yes, a few scenes are unintentionally goofy, so don't eat or drink anything while you're watching this movie.<br /><br />Reading the novel was a dismal experience. Watching the movie was a dismal experience. Knowing that Hollywood actually had the guts to adapt the novel into a movie was a DISMALLY dismal experience. \\"Eragon\\" is basically a silly, simplistic, clich&eacute;d, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and badly pretentious fantasy film that doesn't deserve the $250 million that it earned at the box office. It's one of those movies that just don't work. Babies, kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, and humans in general deserve better than this.<br /><br />Grade: Fles. Like an idiot. He's an idiot.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|May 2nd, 2010 (? AM)<br /><br />Here's a play by play on each individual song on the album (One Of The Boys - Katy Perry). I re-rated the whole album and it went from 3 to 4 stars and some change.<br /><br />One Of The Boys  : Fun and gets the party started right. 8.5/10<br /><br />I Kissed A Girl : A bit controversial when she says it's not what good girls do but yeah. Catchy though. Just not as great as some claim it to be. 7.75/10<br /><br />Waking Up In Vegas : This track has grown on me immensely. Everything about it is precious. If it actually had depth (which it doesn't need, the lyrics fit the mood) then it would be even better. Only docked half a point because \\"Lost\\" is better. 9.5/10<br /><br />Thinking Of You : A pretty ballad with guitars during the chorus. Has Katy thinking of her ex dude while with her current flame. 8.5/10<br /><br />Mannequin :  Picking up the pace again, \\"Mannequin\\" is just a plain fun pop-rock affair. 8.5/10<br /><br />Ur So Gay : Not one of the better tracks although not bad. Could be a little offensive to some but I'm gay and am not very offended at all. Funny ending. 8/10<br /><br />Hot N Cold : Upbeat, dance-y and a bit better than \\"I Kissed A Girl\\". 8/10<br /><br />If You Can Afford Me : Another one of the better tracks. Didn't really like this track all that much at first, but I realize Katy's not in it for the money, she's in it for love. Plus, the vibe is too pulsing not to adore this one. Background vocals are really cute right before the chorus. 9/10<br /><br />Lost : A slow, thoughtful track that slightly even questions if God exists or not. Great, dreamy song about not exactly knowing your place in life. Best track here. 10/10<br /><br />Self-Inflicted :  Another song with high, high energy. If it wasn't for hearing the chorus a bazillion times, I'd probably like it even more. 8.5/10<br /><br />I'm Still Breathing : Pick your favorite shade of black, eh? I LOVE that line. Funny I never realized it before. Like the downbeat feel now and especially love the organ at the end. 8/10<br /><br />Fingerprints : Great song to leave the lasting taste of the album in your mouth. Great message but at times, poor vocals. 8.5/10<br /><br />*********<br /><br />Itunes Bonus Track: I Think I'm Ready : The prettiest track to never make it on the actual main album unless you downloaded it at iTunes. Speaks on falling for all the bad boys and being so used to it, that when a  good guy comes, you just don't know how to act. 9.5/10<br /><br />Wal-Mart Bonus Track: A Cup Of Coffee : My favorite bonus track and my second favorite track period. Talks about a failed relationship and how it makes Katy wanna overdose on prescription pills and a cup of coffee. The magic is all in the delivery of said song. Feels much different than most of the tracks here, more akin to \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" in vibe. 10/10<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />'Lost'<br />'Waking Up In Vegas'<br />'If You Can Afford Me' &<br />'One Of The Boys'<br /><br />SKIP:<br />None.eat feel now and especially love the organ at the end. 8/10<br /><br />Fingerprints : Great song to leave the lasting taste of the album in your mouth.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|if your a true gamer this headset is for you. the sound quality is superb, and rest comfortably for hours of gameplay. being able to adjust the game volume and chat volume is so useful and you can here your teammates very clearly. there is a hissing noise when there is a pause in the game and nobody is talking. the hissing is instantly drowned out when you start playing again. The one negative is the clip on the controller is very fragile. but in all if your looking to invest in a good headset for competitive online gaming. these are great for you.

I am a 9 Handicap golfer and feel that just adding an extra level of confidence when knowing the \\"exact\\" distance to the pin will help me shave a little more off of that number.   Note: I also purchased that neoprene \\"sleeve\\" for the Tour V2 and find it a bit annoying as it slips out of place when taking it out of the supplied carrying case, requiring adjustment before using the rangefinder. A minor inconvenience, but annoying all the same.
0061703257|3.0|My Summary: U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule are called to Shutter Island, the home of Ashcliffe hospital for the criminally insane. A dangerous murderess has escaped and is loose on the island, having simply disappeared from her cell. There is no way that she can get off the island, and it is the job of Marshals Daniels and Aule to find her before it's too late.<br /><br />My Thoughts: This was a very predictable book. It began slowly in the first two chapters, which seemed nearly interminable at first, but once the pace of the book began to pick up, I found it easy to determine the outcome of the novel before I had finished with Day 1 (or Part 1).<br /><br />Dennis Lehane has talent: there is no question about that. He pulled me through the book skillfully and I finished it in a record day and a half (something I haven't done in years). My problem is that I felt as though the book was fairly typical for the genre, and didn't bring anything new to the party. I was hoping for something somewhat more original from Lehane, though I will probably try another of his books in the future.

B00004R99F|4.0|Like the more lesser known DUCKTALES: THE MOVIE--TREASURE OF THE LOST LAMP, this film is also based on a famous Disney TV show, GOOF TROOP, starring, naturally, Goofy. That said, A GOOFY MOVIE feels somewhat disconnected from the show, as indicated by the style of the animation and the lack of certain characters around (Pete's wife and daughter Peg and Pistol, respectively). Not that it is a detriment at all, however; in fact, A GOOFY MOVIE is all the better for it. While there are laughs to be had, what really makes this movie is the fully-realized characterizations, particularly in the development of the relationship between Goofy and his teenage son Max, which serves as the central focus for the story.<br /><br />Goofy (Bill Farmer, who has never been better) is cast as a suburban '90s father who bumbles his way through everything, including almost vacuuming up a prized cardboard statue and smashing a fence when driving his car out of the driveway. An admirer of old-fashioned things like Xavier Cougat, \\"High Hopes\\", and fishing, he is a frequent source of embarrassment to Max (Jason Marsden), who is going through that typical adolescent stage where girls, rock 'n roll, and social acceptance are more important to him. Smitten with one particularly pretty classmate, Roxanne (Kellie Martin), he plucks up the courage to ask her out on a date... but not before hijacking the last school assembly to put on an impromptu rock concert as his idol, a rock superstar named Powerline (Tevin Campbell, who gets to sing two of the movie's liveliest and memorable tunes, \\"Stand Out\\" and \\"I 2 I\\"). Max does this to both impress the girl and win admiration from his classmates (who think he's, well, a goofball), but the exasperated principal (Wallace Shawn) misinterprets his actions as a case of being on a road to crime, a point that he overexaggerates in the extreme on a phonecall to Goofy. Needless to say, Goofy is horrified by the news and forces Max to go on a cross-country vacation with him to Lake Destiny to reestablish their bond. Of course, what Goofy doesn't realize is that Max, who has no choice but to cancel his date, boasts that he will be onstage at Powerline's newest concert in L.A. instead. This sets up a source of tension that escalates between Goofy and Max as they stop at rundown, cringeworthy \\"resorts\\" such as the shady-looking Lester's Possum Park (a very loose parody of Disney's \\"Country Bear Jamboree\\") and even get into an encounter with Bigfoot. (The latter experience culminates with the beast dancing to the Bee Gee's \\"Staying Alive\\" on Max's headphones.) Amazingly, though, Goofy and Max begin to bond as their trip progresses; but Max is still troubled by his predicament, and, thinking his father won't understand, he decides to alter the map so that they can go to the concert instead... ultimately realizing that telling the truth is the better thing to do.<br /><br />Even with the presence of a iconic loveable bumbler like Goofy as the star, A GOOFY MOVIE is primarily targeted at teenagers, who will undoubtedly relate to Max and his adolescent struggles. On the other side of the fence, parents will also be able to identify with Goofy as he deals with his son's resentment about the vacation while trying to prove that all he really wants is for his son to be happy. It's not often to see such a complex development in a project which is disconnected from Disney's canonical features, much less one from a character best known for tripping on his heels or bungling simple tasks (ala the \\"How to\\" Goofy shorts). Ultimately, though, that's what gives A GOOFY MOVIE its heart. No character is portrayed as a purely perfect \\"hero\\" or a downright evil \\"villain\\"; they are surprisingly more multi-layered than what you'd come to expect. Critics have often dismissed this film as a lesser effort from Disney, but A GOOFY MOVIE has achieved a loyal following, purely because of the surprisingly realistic, honest depiction of \\"teenager\\" relationships with their parents.  (It also marks the first time we've ever seen Goofy look genuinely crushed and betrayed, particularly when he discovers his son is manipulating him into going to some place other than their fishing destination, as well as having a heated argument with the boy immediately afterward.)<br /><br />One issue that I do have with A GOOFY MOVIE, however, may be that some of the newer characters introduced, from cheese-guzzling Bobby (an uncredited Pauly Shore), to nerdy class president Stacey (Jenna Von Oy) to Roxanne herself all don't have much screentime. Since all three come across as very appealing newcomers, it would have been interesting to flesh out their relationships with Max and Goofy. Particularly Roxanne, who, although sweet and insecure, leaves one wanting to see her on that special date with Max. This \\"tease\\" somewhat grates on me, although not enough to bring down the film.<br /><br />Technically, the animation in A GOOFY MOVIE (produced primarily at Disney's animation studios in Paris, Sydney, and Toronto) isn't as richly detailed as most of the studio's other films; frankly, though, it is both above-average and very well-suited to this kind of \\"cartoon\\". This is a major difference from the TV show, which mostly had pencil-drawn backgrounds that gave the show a bit of a sketchbook style. The more softer colors used in the film (and occasionally dramatic close-ups) lend themselves well to the more emotional parts of the story (notably when mean-spirited Pete tells Goofy about his son changing the map). The soundtrack is also a lot of fun; aside from the aforementioned rock songs, other catchy memorable numbers include the exuberant \\"After Today\\", the bouncy \\"On the Open Road\\", and the heartfelt \\"Nobody Else but You\\", all written by Tom Snow and Jack Feldman, respectively. Probably the only false note is the \\"Lester's Possum Park\\" singalong, but then again, that may be intentional, since the camp is supposed to be, as Max best describes it, \\"pathetic\\". Carter Burwell's musical score is also quite good, and arguably better than some of Alan Menken's instrumental scores for other Disney movies.<br /><br />All in all, A GOOFY MOVIE may not rank as one of Disney's greatest animated films, but it certainly deserves better recognition. It works very well as entertainment and as a character study, yet as a starring vehicle for Goofy it's something quite different from what one would be used to seeing. That it holds up well even after being released in 1995 (even more so than most of the studio's post-LION KING films, excluding THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, MULAN, TARZAN, FANTASIA 2000, LILO AND STITCH, and the recently released THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, all of which I loved) is also remarkable.parents.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Just recently acquired a used but in great shape Nikon Coolpix P5100 point and shoot. I mated the camera to my SB400 which has transformed the coolpix into a rather impressive dslr competitor. Sb400 can really get the job done while keeping portablity and convience in the fore-front. Best of all, it seems to be a perfect, well balance, match for the camera. Sure to please the pickiest photographer. Best use is for casual and family pictures. For more demanding photographic capture consider Nikon's excellent line of DSLR cameras.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|I enjoyed this movie it brought back memories of the 60's.A good story as well as the music  A must see for beatle fans
B000OPOAM0|5.0|The Terminator was as good as I remembered it.  I told my grandson it was the best of all of the Terminator movies.  After he saw it, he agreed.<br /><br />I am sure we will be watching it again.  Arnold was perfect in the part and I am a big fan of Linda Hamilton.
B000002UTY|4.0|Most folks today don't recall Quicksilver, but IMHO they were one of the best of the SF groups. And yes the band seemed better when it was without Dino-much, much better.  As they would say today...\\"back in the day\\" Happy Trails was my bed time/headphone listen.   Again in my opinion the first three albums were the best, but there are a few goodies in later albums also.  When in later years Nicky Hopkins joined the band it then contained my favorite piano player and my favorite guitar player- John Cipollina.   I saw the group a number of times, but when the Shady Grove lineup played the Filmore East it was one of the best shows I ever saw there (and I saw quite a few!)  Yes one needs to take into account the times that this recording was made and appreciate the music with that in mind.
B00004SAAY|5.0|I agree with Jeff. Turn up the damn harpsichord! I got this hoping to hear the harpsie better than on the Def Leppard recordings I originally purchased about 20 years ago.  And I believe the situation is slightly improved, but still there remains room for improvement, harpsie volume wise. Performances and sound in general are great, though.
B000660UN0|5.0|This will not be the most objective review of this title because I love it so much.<br /><br />I have always been an admirer of Eric Clapton and his work. I've always thought he was a really good guitarist, good-enough singer, and a tasteful musician over-all.<br /><br />His work with Dwayne Allman on Layla cemented him forever as a creator of classic rock and blues music.<br /><br />That said, The Sessions For Robert J has increased my admiration for him, and his work. Indeed, has pushed me over the edge. I thought I knew about Robert Johnson and EC before this powerhouse collection of performances, but I was overwhelmed by it.<br /><br />Rarely do I go a week without watching this DVD in its entirety, sometimes two or three times a week.<br /><br />Robert Johnson's music is deceptively simple in theme yet extremely complex in execution. Many of the themes and licks sound similar, but in truth have subtle differences that give each uniqueness.<br /><br />The songs and playing may sound simple, but please try to play these songs and get the same sound from your guitar. It is an almost impossible task.<br /><br />The backing musicians are phenomenal: Billy Preston on Hammond B-3 Organ, Chris Stainton on piano, Steve Gadd on drums, Nathan East on bass, and the phenomenal Doyle Bramhall II on guitars.<br /><br />The settings are what make it all work for me. They are all live recordings, but without a live concert atmosphere. So there's no showboating, just great musicians at work doing what they love, and it shows. The session featuring only EC and Doyle Bramhall II are exquisite.<br /><br />The performances bring a freshness, a rawness with them. It's the best of both worlds, live entertainment without the pretense of a concert setting. Starts and stops are included, tiny mistakes are left in. It's these qualities that make this project so beautiful. One has only to listen to Clapton's Me and Mr. Johnson to appreciate the difference in feel between a live performance and a studio massaged, overdubbed, perfected product. Me and Mr Johnson, while very good, does not approach the feeling of enjoyment that comes from The Sessions For Robert J.<br /><br />In fact it sounds bound and tight, not free, fresh and loose and fun like The Sessions For Robert J.<br /><br />Even the accompanying CD in the set loses something by not having the starts and stops or conversations included and from sequencing the songs differently than the DVD.<br /><br />Mr. Clapton has produced a masterpiece with The Sessions For Robert J. If you are a fan of either EC or RJ this is a must-add for your music collection., while very good, does not approach the feeling of enjoyment that comes from The Sessions For Robert J.

B00005T7I1|5.0|This still stands as one of the best of the comics brought to life - very colorful, great cast, wonderful soundtrack. This is one that you just have to pull out and watch from time to time.
0393072231|5.0|I don't think I've ever come across a book that so split the vote into 5 stars and 1 stars.  Says quite a lot about people's positions.  I thought it was a great book and the author tells it like he was there every stage of the unhappy process.  Who will ever know the whole story?  But it's pretty certain that most people involved seemed to be looking out for themselves and if they could make big bucks and crash the market - well they'd be off to retire in the Caribbean, never having to work again.  It's an appalling story of incompetence.<br /><br />This is a book that's a roller coaster ride through the years between 2004 up to 2007 - melt-down.  It's riveting although you might want to take a notebook to write down all the names and cross reference who did what to whom and when.<br /><br />As to why there's such a split in the reviews?  Well read them and draw your conclusions.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|For decent, rich, family viewing, this is a good one.  The story-telling is worthwhile and endearing. The characters are each lovely in their own way and unique.  This is one to have in your collection to share...it is that good.  I gave as a gift to my in-laws.  My family enjoyed viewing this one together.  I highly recommend it.
030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is the hefty final installment of the Lisbeth Salander series.  It's a must read for anyone who has invested time in the two preceding books.  However, for those used to the adrenaline rush that went with the non-stop action of books one and two, there may be some letdown in this third novel as the focus is largely on the prospective trial of Salander for the attempted murder of her father and the organization and forward movement of a government coverup conspiracy.  Ms. Salander's now famous superhuman skills as an Internet jockey/hacker do not come into play until halfway through the book.  And it is from that point, that the story line does get a vitamin injection and leaps forward.  Ultimately, author Stieg Larsson brings the tale in for an entertaining landing.<br /><br />A couple of editorial observations about the book.  As well written as it is in most respects, it could have benefited from some judicious editorial tightening.  There is a lot of extraneous information included that somehow slows the action down too much (in my opinion).  In the same vein, Larsson's laudable details of the daily life of his characters are over done in this book.  For example, the reader is informed dozens of times how tired or bone tired or exhausted one or another of the protagonists are.  These personal insights are rarely provided for the bad guys, by the way.  There also occasional awkward phrases or situations that may have read smoothly in the original Swedish, but come off less well in the English translation.  It may be that Larsson was never able to rework the draft of \\"The Girl Who Kicked...\\" before his tragic death and the publishers decided to print the manuscript as it was.  Surely, he was never able to see the book in translation.<br /><br />Long and detail-burdened as it is at times, this is an excellent read and mandatory for anyone vested in the series.
1400034205|5.0|I remember that I read this book when I was 14, and it changed my life. Everything Larry did and everywhere Larry went, I wanted to do and I wanted to go. Thank God I didn't have a passport at this time, because I probably would've run away to India, or some other exotic country that I have only read about or seen in documentaries.    But long story short; This book, among others, is what has given me the courage to pursue my dreams in life, and to seek out truth; Instead of just following the perscribed order of things.
1442300051|5.0|Loved the book and wonder why people named in the book haven't been been subpoenaed to testify before congress.  Tired seeing the people who screwed it and sold out their clients testify \\"it's not our fault\\" infront of the same government people who watched it happen.
0060763280|5.0|This is the best book on wealth creation available. It offers insights in the psychological, emotional, spiritual and physical realms on how to attract wealth.<br /><br />Just two years ago I read this book and it has been a key factor in my business success and my overall happiness and fulfilment. It's helped changed my trajectory from a life of insatiable ambition in which I was addicted to struggle and striving, to a life of ease and plenty. It also got me involved in his seminars, which are truly out-of-this world, inspiring and transformative. Thank you, Harv. I owe the quality of life I now enjoy, in part, to you.
B00206V0ZG|1.0|The One Minute Manager is a wonderful book for those who want to budget there time, and be somewhat more organized. I highly recommend it. However, never purchase a used book as this was not merely used, but was completely marked, highlighted, and written in. It was not worth the price I paid. If Amazon would offer me my money back, or a credit.....I would take it!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|this was a great video.  i didn't do the 30 day workout as suggested, since I tend to workout late at night and being in an apartment complex, I thought some of the moves would be a little noisy for my neighbor downstairs.  but otherwise she was very motivating and moves were easy to follow.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|Loved this movie. Not sure why Audrey Tatou is on the cover when she has a minor role in this movie. This is a great coming of age story about a young man from France, who goes to Spain and experiences life. It happens to be one of my favorite French movies to date. There are many languages spoken in this movie but the main character speaks mainly French. Its a wonderful film I recommend to everyone over 17. Plus it has great music and great comedic moments.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I was happy with my purchase.  The item was described as brand new on amazon and the item fit that description.  It had all the original plastic covering on it and was sealed.  I was really happy to be able to purchase this item because you cannot buy it in stores anymore and I really wanted to add this movie to my DVD collection.  Thank you seller.
0312323867|5.0|First off I am a huge Emily Giffin fan! Loved Something Borrowed, which had me rooting for Rachel even though her situation was wrong. Disliked Ms Darcy Rhone in it since she was the spoiled friend; Something Blue altered my opinion of her for good. I'll admit after reading Something Borrowed I rushed to get Something Blue, was not disappointed. At first I thought I wouldn't like Something Blue since it was about Darcy but the writer makes you like her even early on. I recommend reading Something Borrowed first as this book is the follow up to it. The change of events in this novel pulled me in like in Something Borrowed and I was left wanting more even though the ending was perfect. Makes you want to follow the characters through life but as we all know good things must come to an end. BUY this Book!
0439023491|3.0|After reading Hunger Games I was so excited to read Catching Fire! I fell in love with Katniss and Peeta in the first book and couldn't wait to see what was to happen with them....<br /><br />This second book isn't nearly as good as the first book in my opinion! It is still a good read and a pretty good book, but I have to admit that it didn't hold my attention nearly as much as the first did. The first part of the book was really good. Katniss is dealing with her feelings for Peeta and Gale and figuring them out. Then they find out they have to be in this year's Hunger Games...this is when the book lost it's appeal to me! The Games were still interesting, but by the time they were competing in the games again I was ready to be finished with the book. I think I would have enjoyed it more maybe if one of them would have been put in the games and the other one watched...or maybe if they would have been the mentors this time like Haymitch was to them...it just felt like book one repeated itself a little to me.<br /><br />I missed Katniss and Peeta's interaction as a \\"couple\\" in this book. Of course there was some interaction, but I was left wanting more...<br /><br />The ending of this book has a great little twist to it, but at the same time was so annoying to me! In the first book you get some closure, but in this one it just completly leaves you hanging...I hate that!<br /><br />This was a good book and I will read the 3rd book for sure, but I was hoping for more I guess...
B002VWONB2|5.0|We have the standard DVD version but wished to try the blu-ray format.  Being black and white, we thought the improvements over the previous version would be minimal.  Not so! Differences are remarkable.  One can see details in the artists' dresses, for example, that are entirely missed in the DVD version.  Strongly recommended, especially for Casablanca fans like us who never miss a chance to seeing it again!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|an unexpected endig to a heartwarming tale. its one of those being in the right place at the right time kinda stories.
B002ONC9NM|3.0|I don't want to start out with a negative tone about AN EDUCATION, but I just can't help myself!<br /><br />The thing that draws me into a movie is mainly the unexpected. Give me, too, some good character and a good story and I'm hooked. But An Education gave me only the characters. The story was completely predictable. It is, at its core, a coming of age story. And its one that we've all seen before.<br /><br />There's nothing remotely challenging for the viewer to follow. That doesn't mean I take ANYTHING away from Peter Sarsgaard ([[ASIN:B001FFBI82 Jarhead]]) as the handsome, witty, and alarmingly charming David. Nor can I say anything remotely bad about Carey Mulligan ([[ASIN:B002VWNICW Pride & Prejudice]]) as the smart but inexperienced Jenny. When these two characters collide, sparks certainly fly. But they aren't unexpected. Or in any way surprising.<br /><br />When we meet David (Sarsgaard) we immediately know that a guy this age should not be philandering around with a sixteen-year-old school girl. And I guessed much of what was to come long before it was revealed (no spoilers). I also knew how Jenny would react. She's an amazingly smart young lady, so her ability to handle this situation wasn't shocking at all.<br /><br />Some people have commented on the supporting cast, especially Emma Thompson ([[ASIN:B000W796OM Harry Potter]] series) as the Headmistress. But I didn't find her character intimidating or interesting. However, I did find Olivia Williams ([[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men]]) as Jenny's English instructor a very interesting character. She had a profound impact on Jenny's life (pre- and post-David).<br /><br />The remainder of the cast were fairly forgettable with only minor flashes of importance and interest that rapidly dissipated.<br /><br />Let me say again that I found the two main characters very entertaining, but the story far too predictable to give a high rating. I am, however, happy that I saw the film. Most of the award nominations and wins were directed at Carey Mulligan, and I felt that was completely justified.<br /><br />Too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold up to the actors' performances.t that was completely justified.    Too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold up to the actors' performances.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|My husband is a Sherlock fanatic so I have experienced Sherlock Holmes in every possible size, shape and media. This one actually exhausted me in a good way.

B000GIXIGY|5.0|A timeless classic of the post-Relf Renaissance. Strong compositions that blend the rock and classical influences, and Annie Haslam never sounded better.A true product of an age that wasn't concerned with easily fitting into genres or classifications.

B001JJBO74|2.0|I thought this book would name the top, middle and base notes of each fragrance reviewed.  Instead it pointed out the leading fragrance notes without further explanation, and a little blurb about how the author(s) \\"rated\\" the fragrance.  Obviously, their opinions are their own, since fragrance is so uniquely viewed by each individual.  The book was more their \\"15 minutes of fame\\" instead of enlightening at all.  The authors come across as fragrance snobs.
0307269981|3.0|Second book in the 3 book series.<br />A pretty good story until the end.<br />At that point you kind of have to suspend reality.<br />All in all, it keeps you wanting to read on.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Too bad that the Firefly series lasted only one season because it was great to watch - all characters were well chosen.  I watched it over a two-day period not wanting to stop until I've seen all episodes.  The only consolation is that Nathan Fillion is in the Castle series, which is just as clever and fun to watch.
1400052173|5.0|Although I'd never even heard of HeLa cells before I read this book, I found The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks very intriguing. Its title; however, doesn't do justice to the fact that it is, in fact, several stories in one. First, it's the story of the life of Henrietta Lacks: her genealogy, upbringing, and children (from way back up to the present). Second, it's the story of her experiences at Johns Hopkins, especially as relates to her diagnosis of and treatment for cancer. Third, it's the story of author Rebecca Skloot's efforts to get the scoop, which, after mistreatment and misinformation (inadvertent or otherwise) on the part of previous persons trying to obtain info, required a lot of patience and kid-glove treatment of the family members. Finally, it's the story of the HeLa cells themselves: the controversy surrounding their acquisition and dispersion, thier use in medical research, and contribution to medical advances. Interestingly, the controversy concerning the acquisition of human cells still exists today, as indicated by the author in the Afterword. To the oft asked question, (p 315) \\"Wasn't it illegal for doctors to take Henrietta's cells without her knowledge?...,\\" Ms. Skloot replies, \\"The answer is no-not in 1951, and not in 2009, when this book went to press.\\"<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is engaging, informative, fast-paced, and one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time. The top-of-chapter-page timelines are a clarifying bonus feature. On similar subjects: Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman, and Fever! by John Grant Fuller.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|This movie is just fun to watch.  The cinematography is stunning, the story line is worthy of Shakespeare, and watching Meryl Streep rock ABBA music (while obviously having a blast doing so) is fun, funny, and vastly entertaining.
0887307280|5.0|This book revolutionized our service business, I wish I had read this BEFORE starting our new business.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I bought this book on kindle for something to read on a long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  It leads you gently, pulling you along, until before you know it you are so involved with the characters that you never want it to end. I was mesmerized at the end, reading slowly but unable to stop.  It was shocking and ended too quickly for me.  In fact after I finished reading I went back and re-read the last two chapters I was in such a state of disbelief. Wonderful book, wonderful read. I will never forget it.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I only have the basic version of this album, so I can't comment on disc 2 or their Genesis cover. But the original music on disc 1 is their best to date. I really wish I could have got them doing this live in LA a few weeks ago. The musicianship is tight, and I found the drumming and bass especially so, driving through all of these tracks.    As to some of Morse's lyrics? Give it a rest. Those of us who listen to prog music listen to weird spiritual and other worldy lyrics all the time. And yes, Morse's solo work of the last few years is profoundly Christian. So there are some very spiritual lyrics on this album, but nothing overtly Christian. And so what? It is the total piece that works together and makes some powerful music.    Unlike Asia and other \\"super groups\\" Transatlantic is well grounded, solid musically, and they obviously enjoy working together.    This is an excellent example of modern prog/metal rock.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Wow...I never knew this was a TV series. You have to ask yourself who in the hell runs the net works. To cancel this show just shows you that they just want mindless crap. This show has got to be one of the best I've ever seen. I just wish they would have given it a little longer shot. Maybe I would have found it when it was playing. It's very entertaining and fun. I think most people that watch this will like it. Do yourself a favor and get a copy.
B00003XACV|5.0|There isn't much I can add to some of the great reviews here.<br />I have been listening to this soundtrack from the first day it was released.<br />I have given copies to friends and family.<br /><br />There was like a 3-4 year period where I would listen to this in my office daily.<br /><br />Now, I have it mixed with tracks from Erin Brokovich (also amazing), and a few from Revolutionary Road .. This is one of those soundtracks, that not only brought so much feeling to the movie, but also can stand on it's own.  I find this to not only be an essential soundtrack cd, but music in general.  If you don't own this, or haven't seen the movie, do both.

While I immediately loved both Discovery and Human After All, I found Homework simply grating to my ears and really rough around the edges. It seems Daft Punk really improved with subsequent albums.

Though being introduced and coming late to this material, as it was first published in early 2001, it nevertheless and much like the value investor's bible 'Security Analysis', more then holds its own today in 2010 and surely beyond.<br /><br />The book truly updates my own analysis and could improve anyone's value analysis process from expert to novice. In addition, the back-half of the book espouses the different types of the value playbook one can use by reviewing several value camp practitioners from Mario Gabelli, Seth Klarman, Michael Price, Walter and Edward Schloss, and of course Warren Buffett.<br /><br />As a side note: An updated edition by Greenwald is due in early 2011 which I have already pre-ordered.<br />** (3/18/2011 - Looks like the 2nd Edition will be delayed until 2012 based on anecdotal evidence from some web book sources.) **<br /><br />Reference:<br />[[ASIN:0071628185 Applied Value Investing: The Practical Application of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett's Valuation Principles to Acquisitions, Catastrophe Pricing and Business Execution]]

0385732554|2.0|What a crummy book the Giver is! A novel should tell a believable story, but nothing in the Giver makes a bit of sense. There is no logic. Didn't Lowry give any thought to the world she was creating when she wrote about it? This book reads like it was written in a couple quick,careless weeks, and then published without any review.    The Giver describes the world of Jonas, a 12 year old boy who lives in a Utopian village. It is a perfectly controlled environment. There is no violence, no hunger, no poverty, and everyone has a job and a meaningful place in the community. But in order to construct this ideal world, the citizens of Utopia have to abide by a strict set of rules. They have to sacrifice a lot of free will to the decisions of the Council. For example, the Council decides who you will marry and what your career shall be. Lowry clearly intends to write a Book With A Message, but her delivery is so bad that it is hard to figure out just what The Message exactly is! I think the intended Message is this: in order to lead a meaningful life, you must have the freedom to make bad choices, or else choosing to do good things will be meaningless. Okay, that could be a good premise for an insightful novel, but look at all the ways that Lowry screws it up:     When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned a career as the new Receiver of Memories at the Naming Ceremony. What kind of a job is a Receiver of Memories? It means that Jonas will be required to store all the memories from the world before the Utopian society was constructed. An old man, the previous Receiver of Memories, will transfer all these memories to Jonas before he dies. Jonas will learn about  love, families, passion, war, fear, poverty - everything that existed in the human world before being wiped away when the perfect society was constructed.    In the perfect society where Jonas lives there is no color, no music, no warmth in the sunshine, no grandparents, no hills(!), no true love, no change - because all that had to be deleted when making Utopia. But why? Why do people have to give up seeing color in order to live in a world without hunger? Why do people have to give up music so that there will be no war? Since when did warm sunshine cause greed or crime? There is no logical reason for this. In Lowry's world, the citizens murder their elderly people, and kill the people who break too many rules - this is so that they may live in a world without violence or fear! Does that make any sense? If you were going to be killed if you broke too many trivial rules, wouldn't you live in fear all the time?     What magical mechanism allows the designers of this world to prevent Jonas from feeling the warmth in the suns rays? Why would a society so obsessed with efficiency bother to expend so much energy on blocking the feeling of warmth from the sun?    When the old man who was the previous Receiver of Memories (he is called the Giver, since he gives the old memories to Jonas) lays his hands on Jonas, he can transfer memories with incredible vividness. In the first memory transfer, the Giver passes to Jonas the sensation of riding a sled down a snowy hill. This is a wonderful adventure for Jonas, who has never experienced anything so strange as snow or color. But what strange ability allows the Giver to pass a memory simply by touching Jonas? (Indeed, by giving the memory to Jonas, the old man forgets it himself, which is another item that makes no sense). Later, when Jonas touches the baby Gabe, he can give memories to the baby. But when Jonas touches his friend Fiona, he is unable to pass a memory to her. Why not? Why can Jonas transfer memories only when touching certain people? When Rosemary killed herself ten years ago, all of her memories were dissipated to the rest of the village - but she wasn't touching anyone when she died, so how did her memories get transferred? The Giver tells Jonas that memories are never lost, but Jonas was alive 10 years ago when Rosemary died- so if her memories transferred to all the villagers, and memories are not lost, why doesn't Jonas have any recollection of color, music, etc? If Rosemary's memories are dispersed when she died, then why isn't the memory of dying given to the citizens every time a Giver dies? Presumably, a Giver will have transferred most his memories to the new Receiver of Memories before taking the lethal injection that kills him, but obviously the last thing the Giver will remember is receiving the injection just before dying, so that memory of dying should always be transferred to the village.    After Jonas learns about sledding, he wishes that his village had some hills and snow so that he could go sledding on his own. But the Giver says:\\"We had to get rid of hills, because they are inefficient. It takes extra effort to go up hills.\\" An thoughtless remark that makes no sense - although going up hills is harder, going DOWN hills is easier. The net effect is zero, the existence of a hill does not impair efficiency. Besides, if the village has no hills, what keeps the river flowing in its bed? Without hills to contain the river, its water would spread evenly over the entire land.    Jonas goes to the retirement home where gives a bath to an elderly woman. I believe Lowry intends this scene to shock its readers - there is no nudity taboo in a utopia? But this scene made me wonder - why does anyone wear clothes at all? The villagers live in a climate controlled environment, they don't need clothing for protection or style. And obviously they don't need clothing for modesty. If they are willing to expend enormous effort to remove all hills from their landscape in the name of efficiency, why do they spend any effort on something as useless as clothing? After all, the people who labor to make and clean the clothing could be put to more productive tasks. Another question: why do they live in buildings? Isn't it inefficient to build and maintain structure that you don't need?    WhenJonas receives the memory of a broken leg, his own leg hurts for a while, he limps home that night. When Jonas gets the memory of starvation, his belly aches from the memory of the hunger pains. But when Jonas learns of war, he gets the memory of having his whole arm blown off - but there is no mention of his arm hurting after that. Besides, that is not how memories work - if I think back to when I hurt my ankle playing basketball, my ankle doesn't start hurting. If I recall my last visit to the dentist, my teeth don't start hurting. When Jonas makes his escape from the village, airplanes fly overhead searching for him. To escape their thermal scanners, Jonas thinks of a memory of being cold, and can then actually lower his body temperature! When he is cold in the mountains, Jonas remembers being hot and this warms him up!! Again, this is not how memories work, this is nonsense.    The Giver claims that no memories are lost, and he apparently has the entire lifetimes of many people stored in his head. But how can he possibly transfer multiple lifetimes worth of memories to Jonas in less than one lifetime? In order to absorb so many memories, Jonas would have download huge quantities of experiences all at once, otherwise the transfer couldn't happen fast enough. But if the memories are exchanged at a high speed rate, then Jonas won't \\"feel\\" them. He will have the memory of warfare, but it wouldn't bother him unless he actually recalls that memory. If no memories are lost, does that mean Jonas can now recall an infinite number of times of washing clothes, tying his shoes or going to the bathroom? In real life, memories ARE lost - can you recall what you had for breakfast every day of your life?    Prior to being selected as the new Receiver of Memories, Jonas starts to see flashes of color in his black and white universe - for example, he strangely sees the apple flicker with color. Why does this happen to him? Why doesn't it happen to anyone else? Remember, there isnothing biologically special about Jonas, he has not been specially \\"bred\\" to be a Receiver of Memories. He never gets any special education. Why can't anyone else in the village pass memories with a touch or see flickers of color?    Why does this society keep a Receiver of Memories? Because the Receiver of Memories has Knowledge of How Things Used To Be, the Receiver can advise the Council on their decisions. For example, the Council of Elders suggests that if more babies are born then there will be more Laborers to get the work done. But the Receiver of Memories can recall a time when there was starvation, and therefore advises them not to grow their population. This is illogical. Why not grow more food? Why not have everyone skip one meal a week? Why not kill all the old people sooner and use their food? (In this ideal world, the elderly are sent to a retirement home, where they are treated nicely for a few years, and then they are killed. Why not just kill them right away - there would be more food for the healthy young Laborers, and the people who currently work in the nursing home would be free to do other tasks.)    One of the key points in the story is when Jonas learns that his father has killed one of the new born identical twins. Why does his father kill one? Because it would be too hard to tell identical twins apart! You would think a society that values conformity would want their citizens to look as alike as possible, that way no one would be too ugly or too beautiful. Why does his father hide the fact that he killed the twin? In this society, nobody is allowed to lie. Why does he used the word \\"released\\" instead of saying his killed the baby? In this book we are given multiple examples of how important it is to use the accurate words - for example, Jonas uses the word \\"love\\" in conversation and his family corrects him. Indeed, the book opens with Jonas frightened by an airplane flying overhead, but then he corrects himself and uses the proper word -he wasn't frightened, he was apprehensive. If the society is so precise in its word usage, why does it say \\"released\\" instead of killed?     Why does a plane flying overhead frighten Jonas? It should be routine to see a plane in the air, the planes land at the edge of the village with cargo all the time. After Jonas makes his escape, planes fly overhead searching for him - but won't these planes frighten all the other people who remain in their villages? Why use planes to look for him - they know he is on a stolen bicycle carrying Gabe, so obviously Jonas is escaping along the road - just put up a few road blocks!! There is no logic in anything that happens in this novel.    At the end of the novel, Jonas makes his way to the society that is just like our world - with snow and lights and families. But if it is just like our world, it is also full of violence, crime and poverty. Jonas probably ends up in a foster home, abused and treated terribly. Why don't these other people, who know about violence and warfare, invade the Utopian societies? In our world, if a country was as defenseless as the Utopians, then they would be quickly conquered. A dictator would lead an army to overrun the stupid villages, and they would all be \\"released\\"!     I can't believe the Giver won a Newberry award. It is riddled with inconsistencies, portrays an unbelievable world (no warmth in sunshine? No color?), and doesn't properly get across its intended Message. What a lousy book. Good thing it was short and I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it!

Interesting special effects.  The camaraderie between the teenager and Woody Harrelson.    Cons:  Everything else.  No, really.  The acting is bad.  There's no memorable musical score.  There's no \\"Art\\" in any of the cinematography.  None of the characters develop or change throughout the film.  Product placement, product placement, product placement!!!  None of the characters show any emotion.    The premise is a set-up for the end battle.  There is no tension, no suspense and nothing scary ever happens, so this is not a horror film.  There is no humor, not even a chuckle, so this is not a comedy.   There is no point to the movie at all.  Since the characters have no depth, it is as if watching a bad cartoon.  I did not care if any of the characters lived or died or even if the boy got the girl.    The film felt too long because nothing actually happens.
B001HN694K|3.0|In Tim Burton-directed \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" the titular heroine re-visits (not just visits) the strange world where Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter live. Though two original books of Lewis Carroll serve as the basis of the plot (newly written for the film by Linda Woolverton), Tim Burton's latest offering is about the journey and adventures of grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 19 years old, who has almost completely forgotten the magical world, or \\"Underland,\\" where she once travelled when she was much younger.    This is the second time I was disappointed with Tim Burton's films (the first being \\"Planet of the Apes\\" - I love \\"Mars Attack\\" for its sheer ridiculousness). The change of the heroine's age is OK with me as long as the story is interesting. The generic plotline never gives her a chance to show what she can do, however, and I admit Mia Wasikowska is doing her best, Alice's character remains boring and lifeless.     I am not saying there is nothing to be wondered at in \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Though they lack in style, the pitch-perfect visuals are gorgeous to look at. Helena Bonham Carter's big-headed Red Queen is amusing to see, and so is Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp in a delightfully tongue-in-cheek way. One regrettable thing is that these characters are trapped somewhere in the computer-graphic extravaganza and usual \\"Good vs Evil\\" dichotomy. I almost forgot to say that this is a Disney film.    As in the book, \\"Curiouser and curiouser!\\" Alice says in Tim Burton's adaptation. My impression about the film is opposite. Alice's new journey looks derivative and uninspired, something I didn't expect from the director of \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\"
0374531943|5.0|The 1960s were the golden era of the nascent American manned space program.  Astronaut Michael Collins captures the spirit and details of this period in a highly informative and interesting book.  His writing style reflects his high intelligence and sense of humor.   Among  the various topics covered are the astronauts' selection process, training, project assignments and various space missions.   The \\"creme da la creme\\" calibre of the astronauts becomes obvious, as does the rigor of their training program.   The challenges handled by each Gemini mission and how they paved the way for the Apollo moon-missions are described in vivid detail.   Collins also has interesting observations about the diverse personalities of his fellow astronauts and some other figures.   Of particular note are his comments about his two fellow Apollo 11 colleagues: Neil Armstrong (commander) and Buzz Aldrin.    The historic first moon-landing mission is described.   The book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the history of science, technology and space exploration --- laymen and experts alike.

B00008BRBG|5.0|The Police were probably the most successful band of their time, mixing reggae and rock into pop structures with jazz musicianship, they were a brilliant band. Although there are some who probably turn their nose up at the bands widespread popularity and polished success. Their first album from early 78 shows what a more raw band they could be. The Police's singles were what won them the arena status but the bands album tracks were always great too. This being a perfect example. In order to try and win over more notice in England who was punk dominated at the time, they disguised alot of the more diverse songs in punk energy. Next To You being one of the best openers ever, it's raw, exciting, and rocking. Especially the post bridge/verse, where Andy Summers guitar whirlwinds, maybe making this one of the few tracks that went into hard rock territoty. It's a classic without a doubt. The obvious \\"greatest hits\\" songs here being Roxanne, So Lonely, and Can't Stand Losing You, there were other great melodic yet very complex musically gems on the debut. Truth Hits Everyone, with its subtle verse and rocking chorus, and Peanuts with a great laid back Andy Summer riff during the verse that transforms into a jumping rocker is just musical perfection along with the simple but irresistably catchy Born In The 50's.    Some say the band hadn't perfected their sound till the more popular albums but thats pretty much totally untrue. The craft is here right off the bat. Copeland's crisp polyrhythms and snare drum/high hat accents are masterful. Stings vocals still sound youthful and hungry. The follow up album seemed to be stuck in the middle as the bands weakest effort, trying to find a way to divulge their formula while still keeping true to the debut but it didnt always work. With that in mind, their more popular albums like Ghost In The Machine, and the obvious Sychronictity have overshadowed the debut unfortunatly. The point being, if you're skeptical about the bands massivecommercial inclinations, you may just wanna ignore the later albums and listen to this. Of course the Police were never any less the Police as they were doing Every Breath You Take, but on the debut they were more rock and straightfoward. This was classified as a punk album when it was released which may sound odd today but its for a reason. Bottom line, if you want something a little more aggressive thats still musical and are against commerciality, this is a must have.
B00005B58Y|5.0|It's hard to think of any artist in any genre who put out as much quality music as Miles Davis. This is one of the most special of his albums. There are few jazz tracks as great and important (considering its impact on the genre's development) as \\"Milestones;\\" Adderly's solo is one of the best ever recorded! Another highlight is the group's rendition of \\"Straight No Chaser;\\" their version surpasses any other I can think of. Fans of Miles, bop, or inventive music should own this album.

So when the announced that there would be a new doctor I was a little worried that he wouldnt do the show justice.  However I was totally wrong!  He is great.

0061914177|5.0|I'm still digesting the book, but I think I'm confident in recommending it to you.  (Yes, you.  In case you haven't noticed yet, everyone's a freelancer whether they want to admit it or not.  Some people are freelancers with longer contracts, but the idea of a stable life-long job is long, long gone, baby.)<br /><br />This book has two awesome things going for it:  Mr. Vaynerchuck advocates living your passion, and he tells you it'll be hard work and may not make you rich.<br /><br />All of the above are true.  This book is almost more inspirational book than \\"how-to\\" - though he does give practical examples both from his own experience and from other people.  But he tells you that his exact way of doing things (videoblogs, for example) may not work for you.<br /><br />He then gets to the principles behind his success.  Take those lessons to heart, figure out how to apply them in your situation, and then get on it.  I'm not sure that I agree 100% with everything that he says, but he makes a LOT of good points and gives you a lot to think about.<br /><br />He never claims it's going to be easy - he says exactly the opposite, in fact.  He doesn't guarantee you riches, either - though it might just happen.  It all really boils down to this:<br /><br />If you're doing what you love, you'll gladly stay up late to do it.  If you're not doing what you love, you'll resent every minute.  Take a look at what you're doing for work.  Do you love it?  If not, grab a copy of this book and start reading.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|This is a hilarious, highly implausible, piece of \\"fan fiction.\\" If you are an Austen fan in general and a fan of the BBC productions in specific you will love all of the inside jokes and references scattered throughout. I thought they did a great job presenting Austen's characters with a fresh spin. My one annoyance was a seeming penchant for repeating some phrases add nauseam. BUT, \\"what is done cannot be undone\\" so don't let it get in the way of enjoying the story.    If you are a film production aficionado you will have to overlook the numerous flaws. I myself have had great fun trying to see how many I can catch. This is made all the more delightful by the fact that I never knew how to notice such things until I read the \\"Making Of\\" companion volume from the Pride and Prejudice 10th Anniversary Edition set.

This book is yet another proof of the dichotomy of big business making enormous profit, & the family, which is very poor & has never made any money from these very important cells.

B001OQCV6A|1.0|Tony Stark as Sherlock Holmes is boring.  One review mentioned that Holmes in the books did have martial arts training and had *once* been a prize fighter. All well and true but these things were not the basis behind the stories where they are center stage of these movies (this one and the apparent sequel).      If you're interested in an action packed super hero Sherlock Holmes this is the movie for you.  If you were expecting a well crafted film, a la Chaplin, with action sequences, you will be disappointed. I know 1 star seem harsh for a harmless action movie and I did see the previews. The problem is I was able to rent this for free, didn't have high expectations and still couldn't sit through it.  This means, at least to me, that it was a truly bad movie and that Guy Ritchie is a one trick pony.  I suggest, if you like Guy Ritchie, just re-watch Snatch.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|[[ASIN:B001JNNDGA The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]]]  This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion, specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church, I was not taught about the Stations, but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally, the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion, shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem, and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes.

0393075966|5.0|If one bothers to read the book, one would see that Stiglitz would totally agree that we DON'T have working free markets. He enumerates the myriad ways in which they failed and elaborates remedies in some detail. Among other things, he states (in a reasoned way) that the power of the financial sector has totally perverted capitalism - what we have developed over the last decades is a Corporate Welfare State (\\"privatized profits and socialized risk\\"), which is a FAR CRY from free markets. Stiglitz, being a sensible and responsible person who wants to be heard by those in power, knows this in every detail and strongly but respectfully condemns those who have failed us so dismally. His role does not allow him to fully express the outrage any sane person should have towards the \\"powers that be\\" as they have wrecked and ravaged the lives of so many millions. But it hardly takes reading between his lines to find the basis for such outrage.<br /><br />It used to be (into the 1800's) that petty theft by the wretched poor was a hanging offense. What of the grandest of larcenies that we have seen coming form the wealthy idiots in the financial sector? Is there any justice in the 21st Century?<br /><br />Stiglitz is trying to expose the problem and propose remedies. Perhaps it's for the rest of us to express the moral outrage that is so very, very richly deserved.<br /><br />But any anger or outrage needs be informed and fueled by facts and reasoning, which Stiglitz does provide.

I was so excited to see the new improved video quality of one of my favorite movies, but I have to say that I am unimpressed. I can honestly say this doesn't look any better than the original dvd version of this film, which I had just watched one week before receiving the 2010 version.<br /><br />On this new dvd there is a special feature interview about the process of taking the original negative to make a new print along with side by side examples of the differences. What I find funny is that those exact scenes that really did look better in the special features examples did NOT look like that when you played the actual film! So, tell me? What exactly did they improve, because I'm not seeing it?<br /><br />I am still giving this a 4 only because I love the movie so much I would watch it through a mucky porthole.

0061703257|4.0|Dennis Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\" suffers from many an identity crisis.  It is really a Hollywood script masquerading as a book.  It is a somewhat boring, badly paced thriller putting on the masks of psychology and literature.  It pretends to be original and heavily researched yet borrows shamelessly from popular culture, is anachronistic, and is just nonsensical at times.  But the book works, and it works in the most frightening and devastating of ways, a plot, a scenario, a character, and a fate that burrows deeply into one's psyche after the book closes, and somehow keeps on burrowing in deeper and deeper.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels is the star of the show, and as a U.S. Marshall he is charged with investigating the disappearance of a dangerously deranged serial killer from a psychiatric institution on Shutter Island.  There is much annoying pseudo-intellectual banter between Teddy and the institution's guardians about the human mind, and it is the wondrous and mysterious, stubborn and indefatigable workings of the human mind that is really the theme and protagonist of this book.  The mind seeks order, control, and equilibrium.  As the ego is the dominant trait, everyone formulates an understanding of the world where he is the hero, the raison d'etre whom the world revolves around.  There is a pattern, an explanation, a justification for everything, and if there is not then the mind must re-configure the world until there is one.  We are each of us the only logical and sane, right and true individual on this planet.  This is really the mantra of Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and that's why these two books remain so influential and popular even today:  because they convince us that we are right all along and we will be proven right at the end of the day.<br /><br />What makes \\"Shutter Island\\" so devastating and frightening is that it takes the typical Hollywood thriller and turns it on his head.  Hollywood works because it shamelessly caters to our basest prejudices and instincts, showing us what we want to see.  Countless Hollywood movies are based on an individual who saves America and the world against a nefarious government conspiracy:  this plot not only caters to the American American paranoia about big government, but it also to the individual ego's fantasies of asserting control and order in a random chaotic world that has made the individual insignificant and worthless.  \\"Shutter Island\\" takes this profitable Hollywood trope of the \\"logical righteous individual against a crazy unjust world\\" and asks \\"what if the hero really is the villain?\\"  What if we are the ones who are wrong?  What if we are the ones who are crazy?  Then the only right and sane thing to do, as Leonard does in Christopher Nolan's \\"Memento\\", is to bury the truth and live with the lie.prejudices and instincts, showing us what we want to see.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Maybe this is a comment; not a review.  After reading a few good ones, I only wanted to share my opinion.  And, what I liked a lot about this movie was the adapted screenplay from the novel.    Some scenes are electrical by simply the way the characters talk to each other. Oh, the one between Alex and Ryan at the gate's lounge!    And Clooney, so handsome and witty!  For me he doesn't fit the mold some publications and talk shows had given him; a professional actor that's what he is.
0375703861|4.0|The most striking characteristic about Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" is its musicality, a rhythm assembled from the cacophonic mundanity of multicultural London.  And besides the musicality there are the multiplying literary allusions you would expect from a young Cambridge English graduate.  The style and characters owe a great deal to Salman Rushdie, and there are hints and traces of \\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" \\"The World According to Garp,\\" and other first or only novels that are dynamic and exciting because the writer is so immature and innocent.  \\"White Teeth\\" is a brilliant debut, but because Ms. Smith invests so much of herself and her world into it we need to wonder if she is capable of something greater than this.      The novel is unabashedly and unashamedly autobiographical, but the young clever writer seeks to disguise and dissemble.  We think that Zadie Smith's fictional self is Irie Jones, daughter of an uneven but quiet marriage between middle-aged Archie Jones and an adolescent Jamaican former Jehovah's Witness.  But because Irie is in the background so much, and we actually read so little about her family I suspect that Zadie Smith's true self and family are scattered into other characters and families.      Indeed, two other families take center stage.  There is the noisy fiesty Iqbal clan:  the parents decide critical family issues through fistfights, and when it comes to the most critical issue of them all -- how to save at least one son from the mundane evils of British society -- the worldly yet provincial Samad Iqbal must kidnap his own son in order to send him back to Bangledesh.  The result is that, in refusing to change his stubborn Muslim ways, he loses both of his sons, who are in fact twins:  Millat, the twin who stays in London, throws himself into sexual debauchery before becoming an Islamic fundamentalist,  Magid, the other twin who grows up in Bangladesh, becomes more English than the English, and becomes a science fanatic.  Then thereis the Chalfen clan, who are a universe onto themselves.  The brilliant and self-absorbed Marcus Chalfen hopes to unlock human perfection and salvation through his genetic research, and his equally brilliant and self-absorbed wife seeks to nurture children as she would nurture her plants.  Their son Joshua rebels against everything by joining a fanatical animal rights group that wants to destroy Marcus's research.      The book is about the contradictions and paradoxes in the individuals in a multicultural society.  Samad Iqbal is handsome, articulate, and intelligent, yet works as a waiter in an Indian restaurant whose ultimate home is his Quran.  Marcus Chalfen is highly educated and worldly, yet has devoted his career to continuing the work pioneered by the Nazis -- and indeed his mentor is a Nazi.  The beautiful son has all the world's women at his feet yet chooses to deny everything and seek salvation in fanatical Islam, and the studious son who has grown up in a place of abysmal poverty caused partly by British colonialism chooses to place his faith a British man he's never met.  And Irie, who lusts after one and hates another, has sex with both, gets pregnant, and will never know who the father is.  Multiculturalism is just messy, ugly, and noisy.  And that's why it ultimately drives people to fanaticism and extremes.                 The writing is elegant and polished for a writer so young, the book moves along at a nice clip, and there are some hilarious moments in the book (when Joyce Chalfen gives a plant to a student and tells him to treat it as his father had treated him the student waters it with Pepsi and sits it in front of the TV).  The ending is a complete disappointment, and it's such a convoluted cleverness as to be obvious:  the ending is supposed to tie back to the beginning, but it doesn't, and all that's left is one big mess.  The mundanity of multiculturalism is just one mess that no one can possibly hope to clean up, after all.
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha was an amazing book.  I had a difficult time starting to read this and trying to get into it since it was required for a college class.  However, Siddhartha's story started to unfold and I found myself wondering what he would experience next and where his journey would lead.  His search for inner peace through so many situations was fantastic and I realized that we can all relate to this search.  It helped me understand that the journey for inner peace is not an easy one but is worth it when it happens.  I definately recommend this to others.
0439023491|5.0|Of course if you're looking at buying this book you've already probably read Hunger Games. It's obvious you'll want to get this book as well. If you haven't read Hunger Games and are thinking about reading these books I suggest you buy both that are available because once you finish Hunger Games you won't want to wait for Catching Fire to be shipped, you'll want to start reading it immediately! I'm biting my nails waiting for the third book to come out in August. I highly recommend this series.
0061730327|5.0|This true tale, and the ability to 'see' into the boy's mind as he shared details of his village life, the frustrations of not being able to afford school, the determination to learn and understand, and the inventiveness of his mind and work,  was a delight to read and to try to picture all that took place. I appreciated the few pictures that accompanied the story.
0439023483|5.0|Very engrossing storyline. You'll want to keep reading. Definitely get both available books because as soon as you finish the first you won't be able to wait on the second one to be shipped, buy them both!

B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is an amazing show that deserves to stay on television. It has something for everyone; action, romance, humor, and fantasy. It is shot in the beautiful New Zealand so it has gorgeous scenery. The main cast not only look good but have the acting chops to back it up (Bridget Regan, Craig Horner, Tabrett Bethell, and Bruce Spence). It even won an Emmy for outstanding music.     \\"Legend\\" is great TV because it fits almost every age range. The majority of viewers are adults but I even know kids who love Legend of the Seeker. It is appealing to everyone! Unfortunately, it has been canceled before it was able to reach a season three, but fans are fighting to keep it alive. Lets hope it works and this great show can return to television this fall.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I am not a big fan of Fantasy TV series, But Legend of the Seeker is rather unique, well it does have elements of most Fantasy stories the hero and his comrades vs the evil tyrant, this on the very basic element of this series. Built far skillfully over this is a story of romance, violence, Action, growth, humor, very unique magic, and for a syndicated TV show cast by largely unknown actors well acted.     This has something for just about everyone, both the Guys, Girls, and the violence and adult content is toned down enough that kids 8-10 (depending on their parents) would enjoy this all equally.        If you like Fantasy you have to have this, if you like Sci Fi you will like this, if you like action you will most likely enjoy this, and the same for if you enjoy Romance.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Watching `Lost in Austen', starring Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowen is a great way to while away your afternoon if you are craving for a continuation of Darcy and Elizabeth's story.  But wait!  This isn't your typical sequel.  For that matter this isn't your typical movie.  At almost three hours long, 'Lost in Austen' gives Historical Romance fans of these modern days exactly what we've been craving, a hysterical adaptation of the BBC's 1995 rendition of 'Pride and Prejudice'.<br /><br />Amanda Price, a cute red head in her mid-twenties, lands in the 19th-century world of author Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice.' She does this through what appears to be a bathroom cabinet door.  Already a huge fan of Austen, Amanda has at least some knowledge of the characters on the book, but is a fish out of water when it comes to customs and vernacular of the time period.<br /><br />From the start, we must suspend belief.  This is a movie where the entire premise is based upon time travel into early 1800's.  Once you allow yourself to let go of science and reality, you are ready for an enchantingly wild ride.  Honestly, whoever made `Lost in Austen' realized we were ridiculously spoiled by the length and utter indulgences with character development we received with the BBC's rendition of `Pride and Prejudice.'<br /><br />Miss Price is stuck in the past and Miss Bennet is trapped in the future.  In her attempts to fix the fact that she's bungling the story line, Amanda's first act is to send Jane through the rain to Netherfield.  This seems to be the only thing from the book that goes to plan.<br /><br />Casting was a bit spotty for the movie, with some characters being wonderfully done and others physically lacking.  Wickham's treatment is fabulous and I'll probably be flogged for saying it, the most transformed and most enhanced character of the movie.  Bingley is, as always, simply adorable.  Kitty and Mary were cast perfectly.<br /><br />I think there were problems with Lady Catherine, Mr. Bennet, Mrs Bennet and Miss Bingley.  Although Miss Bingley was as vapid and cruel as she reads, her looks didn't seem to match how I pictured her in my head.<br /><br />We're wonderfully thrown off course and taken down a wild set of events that have Amanda fending off the advances of more than one man and even accepting a proposal.<br /><br />The period people's reactions to our modern everyday non sequiturs are completely adorable.  During an intimate, almost sisterly moment, when asked by Jane what Amanda Price thinks of Mr. Darcy her response is pretty humorous.  `He's not Colin Firth, but even Colin Firth isn't Colin Firth.'<br /><br />There are parts of the movie, where in modern times; Amanda's character would have been arrested for being considered a stalker.  Saying fantastical things and knowing intimate details.  As it is, she is considered eccentric and behaves `rather oddly familiar' with her friends.<br /><br />As someone who cans and preserves actively, there is a wonderful scene where Mrs. Bennet brings Jane a bunch of jars of goodies when she visits her in her new home.<br /><br />The treatment of Bingley and Jane is especially juicy because he has always been a conundrum to those of us who have `type A' personalities.  The writers for `Lost in Austen' really could have focused more of the film on them and not lost an ounce of their audience.  I was pulled into their struggled and wanted to see more of their plot line unfolding.<br /><br />As it is, we do see it develop and a very satisfying resolution, but is any Austen fan really ever satisfied?  If you are reading this column, you are clearly not!  Sequels were made for people like us and will continue to be as long as we rant and rave about it!<br /><br />Is it sacrilegious to toy with the base morals of the main characters in the original novel for the purpose of moving the story forward?  If it works, no.  For `Lost in Austen' it worked very well.  Admittedly this doesn't workall the time and sequels can become utter failures if done poorly.  However, we may be predisposed to allow it in this instance because we are already set in a `modern' tone for the romp.<br />individually to retain this template's appearance.Mr. Darcy in 'Lost in Austen'<br /><br />There are parts of the movie where the bottom of your stomach drops out because of how the original plot of `Pride and Prejudice' has been so terribly muddled.  Characters you've put so much faith in have turned so far from the path you've known them to walk upon you fear the worst, but fear not.  It turns out for the best in the end.<br /><br />I really highly recommend watching this movie.  If you have watched it, watch it again.  WARNING:  It is NOT for purists.  There are characters that are turned completely OUT of character, but as I've mentioned, it works.<br /><br />Watch it simply for the few balls it shows.  I'll admit to the ridiculous joy in watching and enjoying those.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|If you think the \\"photoshop disasters\\" of today make people insecure, you haven't seen anything anything yet.  In the future, as portrayed in Uglies, we won't need such things as we'll be told almost from day one that we are, in fact, Ugly.  But never fear, on our sixteenth birthdays we'll be fixed!  Every scar we got in falling off our bikes as kids?  Erased when they replace our skin with new perfect skin.  Our bones molded and shaped to perfection.  our eyes?  The same.  We'll be molded into something oh so pretty.<br /><br />Unless, could the rumors be true?  Could there be people who dare to live out in the ruins of the old world, aging naturally, and UGLY?  Living as people used to do before we wised up and learned how to be so perfect?<br /><br />This book examines how important it is for us all to not only look but also think differently.  At what price does perfection come?<br /><br />Yeah, yeah... a fictional book with messages.  Not something everyone will like, but I don't usually like books tagged with \\"Science Fiction\\" and \\"Adventure\\" as much as I like books tagged with \\"Fantasy\\" and I loved this.  So for this book to get 5 stars from me, it had to do something right.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|No complaints at all.  Product was in the condition described, arrived quickly and well packaged.
1400082773|4.0|I searched Barack Obama's, \\"Dreams from My Father,\\" in hopes of finding signs forecasting his ascension to the U.S. Presidency as well as evidence pointing to his inclusion into the School of Charismatic Leadership.  Interesting,  I saw all evidence wanting.  There were no signs as exemplified in David Maraniss', \\"First in His Class,\\" a biography on President Bill Clinton's evolution to power.    At best, it is a reclamation of a man who idealized an element of black sub-culture, based on skin color, only to find his own truth in a world fraught with contradictions.  The climax of the book came while in Africa, as Obama and his sister Auma are speaking with an old history teacher of Auma's.  Dr. Rukia Odero says,\\" ...You know, young black Americans tend to romanticize Africa so.  When your father and I were young, it was the opposite -we expected to find all the answers in America.  Harlem. Chicago. Langston Hughes and James Baldwin.  That's where we drew our inspiration.  And the Kennedys---they were very popular\\" (p. 433).  Throughout \\"Dreams from My Father,\\" Obama is expressing the disconnection of his personal experiences with those who share the same skin color.  As usual the case when one feels he's not \\"Black enough (complexion and psychologically),\\" he over compensates believing that the sub-culturally described definition of being black is the objective definition.  Dr. Odero's insights closes the gap of the proverbially, \\"Grass being greener on the other side.\\"  By closing the psychological gap, Obama is allowed to embrace the truism that his global experiences have allowed: Born In Hawaii to a white Kansan mother and black Kenyan father, reared in Indonesia by an Asian step-father, educated in the highest pedigreed universities in the world, and finally, being able to point directly to a country (Kenya) that engenders his future aspirations being manifested in America.     \\"Dreams from My Father\\" is an immigrant story in the vein of Arnold Schwarzeneggerand Rupert Murdoch with sociological underpinning of the Black Experience as a construct. The beauty of Obama's writing is the social experiment he engages himself in to find a panacea for the psychological malaise (part self-induced, part uncontrolled social forces) he experienced growing up.  Obama is reminiscent of a scientist who uses himself as a guinea pig to find a special elixir.  As such, he has produced a psychological blue print, steeped in hybridized cultural influences of power for the ages.  A call to action would be, \\"Find an authentic socio/psychological philosophy to base your understanding of the world and consolidate power from that perspective.\\"      A must read by a man who would become the most powerful person in the world and the process that got him there.

B00328G4XY|5.0|This LP is probably the greatest recording ever made, that is if you are a Hendrix fan.  It was way way ahead of it's time both in preformance and engineering quality.
B001HN69AY|2.0|It was kind of dark and trippy. Great effects. Characters didn't have enough substance/dimension to them. If its supposed to be good vs evil on the other side of the mirror, Dr Parnassus has a long way to go to being good. Ending was depressing.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This album is deliciously dark, rich, and exotic. It captures the essence of Solstice, the longest night of the year, celebrating the introspective moments before rebirth. Sting's voice has deepened beautifully with age, adding even more character to these lulling, and often haunting tunes infused with all the passion and love that Sting brings to his music.<br /><br />Any fan who doesn't enjoy this album completely missed its point.
B0038VPB5W|4.0|Though some people seem to be disappointed by this album, Fever ended up being a very good album. I really enjoyed Your Betrayal and Pretty on the Outside. The album is worth purchasing, so don't listen to those that seem to hate this album.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I love to be dazzled and this DVD does that.  Even though they did not have a stage set up like they did for their 35th anniversary tour it has the orchestra and the animation visuals throughout the concert that you can choose to view or not.  Like Tsongas, and Montreux, this concert is wonderfully filmed and recorded and is the entire show, not edited down so you can imagine yourself there.  It is a two disc set but the concert is all on disc one.  The other disc is just for the extras.  I wish there could have been more to the documentary because I just dont want it to end.  Some people dont care for that stuff but I love it.  If you are a Yes fan this is a must, but it would be good for someone who wants to get into the band becuase the song selection is good and the performances are great as well.  The orchestra adds to the overall effect and I regret not seeing them when they did this tour with local orchestras at each gig.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season 4 continues with Dean returning from Hell. This entire season heads in a different direction that now involves Angels in the fight against Demons. There is a hidden agenda because they can see the future and both Sam and Dean are involved in monumental ways. This season follows in similar footsteps as the previous 3 with a great deal more humor added. Throw into the pot, the threat of the apocolypse and we know we're in for an exciting season. Dean (Ackles) plays an extremely well acted tortured character who has to come to terms with his time spent in the \\"pit\\" and the parts he has and will play the the coming apocolypse. Sam (Padelecki) has changed since his brother's \\"death\\" and is now a very troubled young man who has gone so far \\"off the reservation\\" that Dean has difficulty connecting with him again. This season shows the tug of war between brothers with 1 doubting his worthiness and the other, now an addict and obssessed with revenge. With the brother's fighting constantly and the Angels doing the same in heaven, it's a war that no one seems to win. Castiel is the Angel responsible for \\"rescuing\\" Dean from Hell and he now becomes a major character in the storyline. Where the Angels believe Sam to be an abomination, they are principally interested only in Dean. Sam on the other hand has his BFF, Ruby, and isn't aware of the dangers there until it is too late. Disc 2 of this season has some of the funniest episodes shown to date and is a must see over and over again. This season is a whole new ball game for the brothers and will not disappoint. The totally unexpected twist which involves the 2 brothers was not anticipated and leaves you to impatiently await Season 5. This is the countdown to the biggest mistake the boys have ever made. Much more pressure is put on the Dean character and Ackles does a brilliant job with this. So to with the Sam character, Padalecki portrays his obsessions convinvcingly. Positively a must see. Don't forget the Gag Reels and the end of each Season. Some are absolutely timeless. \\"Eye of the Tiger\\". Watch for it.
B00007KWI9|3.0|I wont review the album except to say that Rhino did a great job on makeing it sound good.  I am learning to appreciate their early stuff as I get older.  Nice to see them use the original cover but also include the US version too.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Season 1 introduces Sam and Dean Winchester (brothers) who are following in the \\"family business\\" and at the same, trying to locate their missing father. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki star as the brothers and are 2 of the hottest looking young actors in and around Hollywood at present. The \\"family business\\" involves hunting down and fighting evil supernatural entities and the boys do an excellent job of this. Dean (Ackles) provides the majority of the humor and the gung-ho \\"I'll kill anything\\" attitude found throughout most of the episodes and Sam (Padelcki) is the more sensitive type who follows his big brother in their quests. He is also the main researcher responsible for finding how to vanquish the creatures. They travel the roads of the USA in a 1967 Chevy Impala which is an awesome machine and the crew does a spectacular job of keeping this unit working perfectly for every episode. Unlike any other show of this genre, this one works. If you are into nice classic cars, a little rock music, loads of kick-ass fighting some goods laughs or two, this is the show to watch. There are some teary moments between brothers and these 2 actors pull this off so well, it's hard to think they are not brothers in real life. Their performances are right up there with the best in Hollywood and will not disappoint. Not a show for little children obviously but be warned, it is highly addictive. Once you start, it's hard to wait for the next episode. Again, if you are into this genre, you couldn't ask for a better well planned series. I give it the highest rating for entertainment.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I found Avatar to be colorful and fun to watch for that. The plot has been done before in different ways. I agree that the Goddess/Lady/Mother doesn't take sides--we are all her children--but after stating that, the film then has the Lady take sides. I realize that in movies you have to have a good verses evil situation--especially in an action film but still. I am glad that I bought it. I don't see where extra minutes would do anything to improve the film and am not about to buy new technology just so I can watch TV. As far as 3D goes, maybe if you have normal eyesight that is a good thing but if you don't it isn't. I will undoubtedly watch it for the colorfulness of it all but still I can only give it a three for the plot.
B003KATMYC|3.0|New Doctor, new companion.  I'm adjusting, and I think Matt Smith and Karen Gillan are pretty okay so far.  I was COMPLETELY charmed by the first episode of this season, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", and I was also fascinated and moved by episode 2, \\"The Beast Below\\".  I do, however, felt the need to warn Amazon customers that episode 3, \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" is probably the WORST episode of Doctor Who since the show was brought back in 2005.  \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" makes absolutely no sense and follows no interior logic.  The acting is wooden, the dialog put me to sleep, and what has been done to the Daleks is simply criminal.  The once fearsome Daleks now look decked out to launch a ferocious   water balloon attack on Tellytubbyland.  They might as well have made the Daleks baby pink and replaced the classic roundels with posies.  They are THAT not scary.  The Daleks are now well and truly defeated, not by The Doctor, but by the \\"Doctor Who\\" design team.  Dark days indeed.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Disclaimer: This is a review of the PX21 headset, not the p21 like some reviews on this page.    I own both the xbox and the ps3. I wanted a pair of headphones that I could chat with and not disturb the family. All the other headphones that work on both consoles(chat) cost over $100 which I was not willing to pay. I found these and thought they were a steal. Well this is one of those its to good to be true moments.    When they arrived, the chat cable did not work for the xbox. I was pissed but I heard that Turtle Beach had great customer support. They were able to help me and they sent a replacement cable. The replacement cable did not work either. This is a shame because now I can only use it for the ps3.    They work really well when playing games like battlefield bad company 2 and god of war 3. They also do well on the xbox but you cant chat as mentioned above. I've never owned headphones for gaming before so I don't know what to compare them too.    If they ever fix the issue with the xbox cable then I would gladly give it 5 stars. But as it stands now I give it 3 because the multiplatform usability was a major selling point to me.
B000002GFT|5.0|Let me digress: I have been a fan and admirer of Fairport Convention since 1997 when I heard \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes\\" on WNEW FM in New York. It was DJ Dave Herman's 25th at the station, so for A day, the DJs could do what they wanted, as if it were 1972. It was one of the last great stands of commercial free form radio in New York<br /><br />The next day I ran out and got [[ASIN:B00007J36V Unhalfbricking]]. So impressed with the synergy of rock celtic and jazz was I that Fiarport soon became a major staple on my CD player--if you can't have free form FM on your radio (you can but I did not know about WFMU* yet)- do it on your stereo.<br /><br />I did, with Unhalfbrickling being a centerpiece. Soon, I also got Liege and Lief: one of the best albums I put aside for way too long. Justly or not so, Unhalfbrickling dominated.<br /><br />Maybe it is  because that album is more geared towards open jams and jazz detours, where Liege and Lief has more condensed tracks: I am partial to the former, but this is subjective.<br /><br />So, my foot now hurts because I was reaching for something and Liege and Lief fell-corner first, painful--on the top of my tootsies. But this happens to me often and I take the point--play the damn album.<br /><br />So, thirteen years late I just did, and though I am now hobbling around my house, the pain is worth it.<br /><br />What makes Liege and Lief so great is how it puts Celtic into Rock and Rock into Celtic. These songs have rock-octane, but the traditional elements are so genuine, so well grounded, you get the spiciest of both.<br /><br />It is a good thing I have a remote. I am going to play this again right now. I am not going to be walking around any hour soon. Wish my toes well.

B002BSHXJA|1.0|I hate to give this set a bad rating because, unlike some of the other reviewers who gave one star, I am enjoying my set (I am hoping that a one star review will get read, as there are fewer of them). That is, I am enjoying my factory made set.  I purchased this set from a market place seller at a very attractive price, and received a counterfeit copy. I now have a set that I purchased directly from Amazon, and I am very happy with my second purchase. Please take note, if it is selling for less than $200, it is most likely a fake.

B001KR0BDI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A new fan of this author!<br /><br />I'm fairly new to the fantasy genre, but this is towards the top of my list. I love a touch of romance that doesn't detract from the storyline, and this fit the bill. I loved Katsa's development and watching her overcome her issues.<br /><br />All in all, a great read!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The picture on the Blu-ray version of this video is gorgeous and the sound quality through my home theater system is excellent.  True, the movie itself is not the most original of plots, but Cameron did a fantastic job of creating a world for the viewer to be immersed in completely.  Watching on a 52\\" LCD screen in 720p is a highly enjoyable experience and makes me excited for the future release in 3-D.  It has me drooling over a wide-screen 1080p, LED, 3-D monitor now, but I'll definitely wait a while for prices to come down as competition increases in the market.  Overall this purchase exceeded my expectations.
1405802030|4.0|This was entirely my fault, the book that I bought turned out to be an abbreviated version to stimulate people to read.  I did not read the product details.
076790592X|3.0|This is a really nice book, despite being based around the dying months of a lovely guy with an awful disease. I can see why it has sold so many copies.<br /><br />To this point I expect I might be attracting helpful votes on amazon - but I think I'm about to reverse the trend. Before I do, I should stipulate that Morrie comes across as a genuinely warm and wonderful individual, and Mitch Albom is only trying to offer a good and encouraging thing in this book. Hats off to Morrie for keeping so vital and positive throughout his life and last days, and I totally understand Mitch's yearning for a role model, and his excitement about rediscovering Morrie.<br /><br />So why the hesitation? There's no way I can write this without sounding (even being) condescending (I wonder why I'm so defensive in this review). But -  for all that it's a true story and the suffering, and courage and affection through suffering is real - Morrie came across to me as more a tops bloke than a guru. All these profound topics are there, but this is philosophy `lite'. It feels like the vague inklings most of us have to be less materialistic and more engaged in community, without really facing the difficulties of how this is realised. I mean, sure, if Mitch had no idea that living totally for your job, money and status was a dead end, well, great to have someone challenge this. But for anyone of the millions who already have realised that their identity is best realised beyond this, `Tuesdays' didn't really challenge or aid. It's not as simple as, \\"Oh, money isn't everything.\\" I think a lot of us get this, but still have to live, and there's no real grappling with a constant dilemma of mine, balancing the obligations of not living off others with the soul-destroying nature of much of the workplace: you may not be driven by futile ambition, but you probably still have to go to work. It is significant to me that for all the talk of living simply, Morrie and his wife both worked as full time professionals and had the money, for example, to afford the very expensive care that he received to the end. I'm not saying for a moment that it was wrong for them to work, or to enjoy their work (good luck to them), or to have a nice house and to pay for the medical care. Not for a moment. But I do find it hard to see the particularly different perspective being offered by this largely conventional middle class couple.<br /><br />And I suppose that's part of the appeal (I'm ducking now): this offers all the comfort of thinking you're being spiritual and running against the crowd - without any need to actually change your behaviour in any way. Albom does write very self-consciously as if he's offering important profundities, even if the very layout of the book presumes a pre-teen attention span, and the naive tendency to goggle at obvious techniques like the common half-sentence bombshells Albom frequently plants:<br />`...I had the coldest realisation that time was running out.<br /> And I had to do something.` (p. 59)<br />[Dramatic chord, and end of chapter]<br />And then only a couple of pages later:<br />'...We all need teachers in our lives.<br />And mine was sitting right in front of me.'<br />Perhaps my radar (or chip on my shoulder) is more particularly attuned to this because of the widespread reaction I see to my personal guru (Jesus) in churches, and in my own life. Christ actually did throw out hugely demanding and inspiring challenges (just try loving your enemy - as he did - as more than a platitude. Hey, even just loving your neighbour as yourself), and the occasional oddball Christian I see who genuinely does live by some of them simply doesn't have an everyday life with a patina of self-reassuring spirituality on top. Their ideal last day would contain something more than some morning exercise, nice meals, catching up with friends, and having a dance. Sure Albom's point was that Morrie, to his credit, was often living his ideal life, and not caught up with pining for more, or with regret. But this is also such an invitation to pat yourself on the back if you might have the odd Saturday just like that: wow, maybe you really are a profoundly spiritual person after all.<br /><br />Is there anything wrong with some of the values of `Tuesdays'? Not really. But I suppose I was looking for someone really counter-cultural, more meaty, in a way that Morrie wasn't. Actually, maybe not so much Morrie (very impressive that he got so involved with some of his patients beyond the merely clinical to genuine compassionate action) as Mitch, and, by extension, his readers. The book also reminded me of `Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance': for all the hippy ideas thrown around, how many people have actually been significantly changed through reading either of these books? Maybe they have been, I don't know, but I suspect the change is more in feeling comfortable than in acting more compassionately and courageously. It's a feelgood book, as opposed to a book that extends you. It's even feelgood about death:<br /><br />'As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on - in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.' (p.174)<br /><br />Sorry, but this is twee. Right, my child, my mother, whoever, someone I love is suddenly killed. But that's OK - they haven't really gone away - the love and memories are still there. Phew, I thought that might be a tragedy, but no harm done really.<br /><br />It so fits for me that Oprah produced a movie of the book - she tells you what you want to hear. Nice, but not prophetic. If I'm after a guru I've got to feel called to something better - maybe difficult, but pure and worthwhile. I want to shun the endorsement of complacency that subtly underpins what I saw in the well-intentioned `Tuesdays'.is also such an invitation to pat yourself on the back if you might have the odd Saturday just like that: wow, maybe you really are a profoundly spiritual person after all.

B001QXE0OC|4.0|From a marketing standpoint, it's no surprise that Disney would promote Selena Gomez as a singer. And why not? This girl has a lot of star potential; She's extremely cute, charismatic and has already won millions of hearts as Alex Russo in the Disney show \\"Wizards of Waverly Place\\". The girl is equal as financial success. But in a cynical, business driven world, it's good to see that some of the market adjusted products ends up as being compelling products - and that's fortunately what Selena's debut album is.     \\"Kiss & Tell\\" is a surprisingly edgy, energetic and upbeat album. Although some of the songs are overproduced to appeal to Gomez' youngest fan base, they still comes off as catchy, listenable and with good melodies. The songs are overall are mix of electronic/pop rock-elements. Her singing voice is also surprisingly decent and the lyrics are quite acceptable.     As for the first single, \\"Falling Down\\" is a decent enough choice, but gets surpassed by stronger songs, like the second single \\"Naturally\\", \\"Kiss & Tell\\", \\"More\\" and the cute, little ballad \\"The Way I Loved You\\", just to mention a few. Although the last, two songs, \\"I Got U\\" and \\"Tell Me Something I Don't Know\\", pales in comparison to the rest of the tunes, the album is overall a good debut for Gomez and her new band, The Scene.    Since Selena is already sharing the spotlight with Miley Cyrus, a comparison/rivalry is inevitable. But this time, Selena takes the victory home with a album that is better than anything that Miley has currently released, despite of Miley's musical genes. Only time will tell if Selena will continue to have a place in the music industry. Until then, she certainly can be pleased with this excellent debut album.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC band and a TERRIFIC album from start to finish.  I am in my 40s and a music FREAK.  How I missed the boat on PT until recently is beyond me.  Since hearing this a few months ago and other PT releases I am hooked on this band.  Saw them in April 2010 in Chicago and was blown away.  They played Anesthetize from Fear of a Blank Planet and it was UNBELIEVABLE.  Like the force of 10 atomic bombs going off at once!!!         The creativity, production, songwriting, harmony vocals, and variety of mellow, rock, metal, and atmospheric styles keeps things very fresh and interesting.  This album is a modern classic -- don't miss it.  The live DVD from an earlier tour is great too.  The drummer, Gavin Harrison is so bloody talented --- a bloody gem of a player.  Once of the best for sure!!    I hope this band continues for a LONG time.  True modern artists with fantastic chemistry.....Stop me now as I am out of breath from listening....
B00012FXB8|3.0|When Alien 3 first came out in ‘92 I was equal parts excited and hesitant, but could hardly wait to see where they would take us on this new journey. The first thing that threw me was that James Cameron would not be directing the follow up to his amazing sequel Aliens, and after some deliberations about the film, I finally rented it, refusing to see it in theaters. However, after watching the film, I was left pretty mind-numbingly confused.<br /><br />The film starts off pretty much in the wake of the events on LV-426, but shortly after the initial scenes we are shown that Hicks (he and Hudson were my favorite characters from Aliens), Newt and Bishop wouldn’t be coming along for this ride, which I immediately felt was a massive let-down. I’m not sure if the actors weren’t interested in making a sequel to Aliens or what happened, but I couldn’t understand how Ripley spent so much time saving these people originally only for them to die in the first 5 minutes of the third film. I was angry that David Fincher would be so brazen as to change the whole dynamic of the movie, but I felt that I would continue on and give it a fair shake.<br /><br />After Ripley crash lands on another planet, which she soon discovers is inhabited by all things undesirable, she takes kindly to the facility doctor and soon discovers that she has brought an unwelcome friend along to the planet with her. The &#34;Company,&#34; as Ripley often refers to them, has soon discovered that an alien is alive and well on the planet, and they try everything in their power to assure that the specimen is kept alive and well for their Bio-weapons dept. By this point you know that Ripley simply can’t allow this to happen, so after a two hour waged war she destroys the alien, and unfortunately, herself along in the process. With Ripley's death one would assume that the series would end, but five years later, we were again smacked in the face with Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />While I don’t actually hate this movie with as much passion as many from the film franchise do, the sad fact is that David Fincher had a near impossible task of following up James Cameron’s epic masterpiece Aliens. Fincher may be an intuitive director in other genres to be fair, but his outing in the Alien world fell flat and left a bitter taste in many fan’s mouths.ch passion as many from the film franchise do, the sad fact is that David Fincher had a near impossible task of following up James Cameron’s epic masterpiece Aliens.

B00005UEAR|5.0|It's not quite as good but it's still amazing. It's very different than their last and it's way heavier than their last 2 albums, sounds similar to Awake in a few songs. It's very progressive, experimental and diverse. The 1st disc has some of their heaviest work to date, while the 2nd disc is more melodic and it's one long song with 8 parts. It's one of their best albums to date and I'd recommend it.
B000RW3VD4|4.0|Read these words spoken by Gordon Gekko and try to remember, if you can, when the world was different.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: \\"The richest one percent of this country owns half our country's wealth, five trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons and what I do, stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. You got ninety percent of the American public out there with little or no net worth. I create nothing. I own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price per paper clip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody sits out there wondering how the hell we did it. Now you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy, are you buddy? It's the free market. And you're a part of it. You've got that killer instinct. Stick around pal, I've still got a lot to teach you. \\"<br /><br />Wall Street, the film, has reached its 20th anniversary. The film was first shown in 1987. The sights and the scenes have changed, but not Wall Street. We had a Senate Investigation two weeks ago and what did we learn? Wall Street is greedy and has the same mentality. Gordon Gekko or his facsimile is still in charge and the world is beating to his drummer. It was a little frightening to see Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas working their way through the streets and buildings of New York City. Making money, the name of the game. We all know the story, and we all know how it turns out. Except there is always someone to take their place. Time moves on. The most amazing part of the film for me was to see John C McGinley, he of 'Scrubs' in his younger days, and James Spader, he of \\"Boston Legal'. Martin Sheen, Hal Holbrook, and Sean Young. Micheal Douglas, as the young, handsome and ruthless Gordon Gekko, won an Academy Award for his performance. Wonderful performances, all.<br /><br />I urge everyone to see this film again. It is a wake-up, again!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 05-03-10<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002QW7AMG Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005ONLF Beyond the Law]]mmended.  prisrob 05-03-10    [[ASIN:B002QW7AMG Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]    [[ASIN:B00005ONLF Beyond the Law]]

Actually I remembered her from Michael Jackson's This is It, but I didn't even imagine searching for a cd. I got it and it's very cool. This girl really can play the guitar. Really cool sound!!!
