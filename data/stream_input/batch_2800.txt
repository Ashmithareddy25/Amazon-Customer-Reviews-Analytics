0062073486|5.0|And Then There Were None is Agatha Christie's greatest book and most clever. I have read it multiple times and every time I love it and am amazed at how good it is. It keeps you on the edge  with subtle clues and riveting characters. The ending is simple elegant and yet impossible to guess. And Then There Were None is truly one of the greatest mysteries of all time.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I enjoy this show when I have time to watch TV. Not gory, entertaining and smart. You can like or hate the characters. Though I mostly don't like them I still like to watch them. Margolis is terrific.
B00459EZLW|2.0|Year one was great; the best of the Stargates, but midway in season 2 even with the same excellent actors (especially the two leads and LT,)  the writing turned to crap and dribble. I can see why it only lasted two seasons..
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Hugh Jackman is the best Jean Valjean I have seen (and I have seen 3 versions of Les Miz). It was great
B0088W4YTK|4.0|To me, the best of the SG TV series. SG1 the worst followed by SGU. I wish it had lasted as long as SG1.<br />Jason Momoa really lifted this series, and he made a great Dothraki leader.
B00464AVXW|3.0|Why this film is so highly rated is a mystery to me, as much as I wanted to like it. At its beginning, two high-powered actors (Freeman and Pitt) deliver dialogue better suited to a couple of petulant teens, and Pitt (as Detective Mills) keeps acting like an adolescent for the rest of the film. The (mostly) rainy exterior settings make for muddy dialogue, and both Freeman's and Pitt's lines in these settings are seemingly delivered sotto voce (or it is poor audio editing). Gwyneth Paltrow (as the Pitt character's wife) is wasted. Freeman underplays his role too much. Only Kevin Spacey (as John Doe, the killer) scores in this film, and it takes an eternity for his appearance.<br />  The characters have no believable chemistry, no sense of emotion or even involvement. The so-called tension between Pitt and Freeman seems contrived, as does the relationship of Paltrow and Pitt.  I felt that the characters and the film developed too slowly. If &#34;Seven&#34; is considered a 'neo noir' film, the genre needs a little work and/or re-definition.
B006OB3K56|5.0|My fraternity brother suggested that I check out this film, so I purchased it not long after it became available on Blu-Ray.  The acting was nuanced but powerful.  It was also very appealing visually.  It made me think -- hard.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|I rented it because of Channing Tatum, but the unexpected plot twists actually wound up being the thing to keep my attention.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Uninteresting game . I am used to are a lot more challenging. Not plot just hunting for objects over and over. Could be a lot better
B008XG1X18|2.0|The app keeps closing. I can't browse for more than 8 minutes without it telling me it has stopped responding. I'm using it on kindle fire HD. I keep checking for updates but never find any. What should I do, I love pinterest and I enjoy it in app form.
B0090SI582|3.0|Let's see where do I start, how about with the simple fact, If you love Wolverine as a comic book character... this movie is not for you. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine, I can't blame this movie's flaws on that. They make Wolverine out to be pretty weak without his healing factor and while that is part of his strengths it isn't all of them. Wolverine goes to japan, and doesn't know how to use a sword... flaw, He is a master of every martial art known on earth as well as a ex-special forces member. Second he speaks several languages, including Japanese, his first wife was Japanese, he should know it. Third he is not an idiot, he is rather clever and though he often relies on his healing factor for fighting, he would change his style without it, and resort to his agility and strength, which is more than enough for non-superheros. I can go on and on with the flaws but fans of his already know this.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of his from comic books than this movie is quite a bit better, It has action, moderate plot etc. Pretty typical Marvel movie, and much, much better than Origins. NO this is not an X-men movie, and no Wolverine is not always an X-man he has been passed around to several marvel teams. He also has his own comic series, that's run pretty consistently. So do not think of this as an X-men movie. It doesn't belong in that despite Jean Grey's appearance.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Hard to find apps that will run on 2.21. I am stunned, and hopeful that it will not glitch up for a while.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I enjoy an album that flows from song to song. It takes the listener through facets of a relationship and doles out the accompanying emotions quite well.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My girls really enjoyed this movie. Great musical number. They dance and sing around the living room! They have the entire movie memorized! :)
B0034DGPEU|3.0|From the wealthy to the poor, every page had bad things happening to good people.  No let up.  All &#34;Evil Wins&#34;.<br />I know things were bad, but why would they want to live?
0399534601|5.0|This work has been used in one of my university courses for industrial design. It has a great way of allowing freedom while doing real anthropological research. The book is full of 'explorations' - 50 in total - that motivate you to get up and explore the world right at your feet - you don't have to go far or even anywhere at all to learn something new.<br /><br />The layout is easy to follow, and has lots and lots of room for your own personal notes and reflections - which is what the book is all about - along with some inspirational quotes and facts to get you out and off the couch.<br /><br />Love Keri Smiths work - definitely recommend for designers or those who are simply curious about how people relate to their surroundings.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I watched a clip of this show on the YouTube website, I was impressed by the way it looked. When I watched all 26 Seasons of this show on the Hub, it happened either during, or after that Season. Either way, I had become like other men who ended up liking this show; a Brony. Then I watched Season 2, and still liked it. Season 3 was short; only ran for 13 episodes, but I still liked it. I kept playing this game on my niece's little iphone, or whatever it was. Now I have a Kindle Fire of my own to play it on.<br /><br />Shop for Ponies, shops, banners, and even play games with the Ponies. Build your own Ponyville enviornment any way that you'd like. Only downside, but not too big of a deal, you have to spend money in order to buy bits (that's Pony Money in case you didn't know) so that you can SPEND those bits.<br /><br />Despite that, this is still a pretty fun game for any Pony Fan, or Brony, or even Pegasisters to play.<br /><br />Hopefully, this game will tide me over, even until after the TV premier of Season 4.<br /><br />5 stars, and a 9 out of 10 for the MY LITTLE PONY - Friendship Is Magic Game, and App.<br /><br />Get your Brony on.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now watching Season 4 of the show, and enjoying every minute of it. Weird Al guest appearance, a mysterious box, three Fluttershy episodes so far, hope to see how it ends. ;)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I think every android device should have a file explorer, and on the kindle, the ES File Explorer is the one to have. It is easily accessible, and the design is good for what it does. A+ amazon app.
B00AKKS278|5.0|I am doing my Miracle morning for a month now. Being a working mom has left me with little time for personal development. Now I wake up at 5:30 and I have enough time to do it all. Thanks Hall for this wonderfull book!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|+Not very interactive, there is really much to do in this game, it would've been nice if Nemo had a quest but he doesn't :(
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter keeps getting better and better, with new plots, and hang on to your seat scenarios!!! Excellent!! Highly recommend this series.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|We were told this was a cute film...and it did fit the bill for a fun movie to watch last night!
B0081336FO|5.0|I watched the first 15 min of season 1 and was hooked; watched the rest of season 1 and went straight to season 2. Now I'm bummed I have to wait til 2014 for season 3! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are fantastic actors, and both play their roles to a &#34;t&#34;.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I loved the game itself but whenever the internet would cut out for a second I would get kicked out in the middle of the game and I would lose the coins I used to play. This wouldn't be such a big deal if this didn't happen during EVERY GAME! I don't have this problem with any other app and it has become so frustrating I deleted the app.
B003G4W49C|4.0|But I did. It is a Xbox game in a book. The ending felt like it was rushed.  Since I know there is another book I will look forward to reading it. The story is a little hard to believe but not hard to believe there are children that are extremely smart and if taken care of, could do wonders for humanity.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I Love Facebook to stay in touch with friends and family and also I like to play the different games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good scripting/acting/musical background/scenes/camera work!<br />A believeable plot line with excellent follow through of the sub plots.<br />Hope to find more like this.
B007HO392S|5.0|I enjoy this woman's music - and this was the first of her CD's - the lyrics are smart and the music well done.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|This is a great movie - the DVD was wrapped and in perfect condition when it arrived. I have no complaints about it.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Like the best ghost stories, it's less scary than it is just plain sad. Even so, you might not want to watch it alone and in the dark.
B00CFA222M|5.0|This is a great movie - the DVD was wrapped and in perfect condition when it arrived. I have no complaints about it.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Even though I am from the Atari era/age, this was not fun. Most of the games are locked. Feeling waste of time..
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Best songs from the best Hawaiian singer, I play it over and over and over and over and over again.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I received this in excellent condition and in a timely manner. I'm anxious to purchase the third Iron Man. I enjoy action drama and suspense.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Well written with many surprises...Actors do a great job with their parts. Enjoy watching  with my family during the weekends.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|added this to my Statham collection
B00C32R64G|5.0|I listen to a lot of music and am constantly trying new albums. It's difficult to find something that really blows me away. This album did it. Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies practically invents a new genre and is worth listening to again and again. Its only flaw is that the lyrics are awful, but I imagine that is the result of English not being Volbeat's primary language. However, Michael Poulsen's vocal style makes up for it and you hardly notice the lyrics at all unless you sit down and read them. Don't pay attention to  reviewers who complain that Volbeat &#34;sold out.&#34; This was definitely a case of maturing as a band.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was added to my collection of movies so I can always count on Amazon to get my entertainment at a reasonable price.
B001QI0FAA|5.0|If you like psychological thrillers, this is the one to watch.  Very low key horror...the suspense builds with minimal fx.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|The game was super fun, so fun that I in fact, for the first time ever, actually spent money in the game. However, now all of a sudden the game won't load at all. The green bar shows it as loading but right as it's about to show you your screen, it just crashes and boots you back to the home page of my Kindle. So now I'm out of real money and can't play the game. I hope they fix it soon. I think it started happening after an update.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|I'm a big Simon Pegg fan so I really enjoyed this. Not as funny as Shaun of the Dead, but entertaining all together.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Pros: it is a lightweight sturdy case that fits my kindle fine.<br />Cons: it doesn't work as a stand because the crease is too shallow for it to stay up. It doesn't allow reading or watching videos from an angle as it keeps falling flat. It is frustrating to keep holding up.
B003719G40|5.0|Great idea for a wedding or shower gift but its never too late!  They should make this required reading in high school.
B008Y7D4FY|4.0|Very suspenseful however I find that creatures are sometimes more scary when you never see the full creature, when you only see quick glimpses of the creature.  In the very last minutes of the movie they show you the full creature and once you see it, its not so scary anymore it just looks like a dressed up person.  Would have been better had they just kept the creature in the shadows and quick glimpses, just my opinion.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Big fan of the show. The book provided a more in depth look into the characters and the rich and vibrant world George Martin has created. I will surely be reading the others in this series.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|I thought, yeah this should be a great movie - I mean look at all the big name actors/actresses in it!  Nope, nada, wrong.  Even James Franco said in a recent interview that of all the random movies he has made this is the one that he regrets doing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I usually do not read suspense novels or mysteries, however, this has been on the bestseller list for a while so I decided to give it a try. The plot is highly original and carefully thought out. The story  unfolds through the eyes of both partners in a deeply troubled marriage. The author does an excellent job of taking us into the hearts and minds of these characters and the plot develops over time through a number of highly unexpected and entertaining twists and turns. This is not like any other novel in this genre and there is nothing about it that feels like a formula. My only complaint is that I found the style of writing in this novel to be artless, lacking in descriptive power or the poetry of language.
B0007939NO|5.0|This is a MUST have for family movie collection!  I love the story, the dancing, singing and story line are timeless and classic.
B002I7FFYO|5.0|In the 1940's when Oklahoma was first produced on Broadway, my father bought one of the first albums.  I was just about nine and listened to it a lot.  I memorized many of the songs. Composers are not writing words and music like Rodgers and Hammerstein did - their songs were memorable. I find myself signing many of them every day - over 70 years later.  How many people know the lyrics and music to songs in many current shows?<br />Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae were exceptional in the film version of Oklahoma (1955). This CD came from the movie version; not the play which ran from 1943-1948.<br />The music makes you want to sing!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Love Dido's voice and this CD has some favorites of mine like The Best Day of My Life (I think that's the title).
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I was very disappointed when I got this app I should have listened to the other reviews this game was dum you couldn't even use the other two charecters without paying 4 dollars a piece don't download this app
B00005AWMF|5.0|I had this CD for several years and it somehow got lost from its sleeve.  Searched high and low but never found it.  I have always loved this one by Sade.
B000FA675C|5.0|Easily my favorite book. It just never gets boring and has very interesting yet historical ideas that you can mull over and Google when you have some extra time. It makes you want to learn history, and its a heck of a read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So many twists and turns that tug at your heart strings! Absolutely love it! Cant wait to watch season four.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Just like all the &#34;Langdon&#34; books by Dan Brown. You're led through a journey of discovery that is both exciting and historically relevant with just enough embellishment to leave you needing more. Gotta love Mr. Brown's writing style; simple yet efficient and exciting.<br />Its a must read.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The movie starts off a little slow but builds rather nicely as the story unfolds. If you enjoy stories that involve children utilizing their discerned moral character and can be uplifted by stories that characterize hope for humanity, then you will certainly enjoy this.  This movie sheds light on the good that a community can achieve when faced with catastrophe.
0440217563|1.0|this paperback smelled so bad i had to seal it in a bag with perfumed soap before i could read it. terrible smell!!!!!

B005TKD6NY|5.0|Typical Murakami, takes you into the character's mind and makes the weird seem normal. Or perhaps that's just my way of looking at it.
B003CN4R74|5.0|This album is amazing and very beautiful every song is amazing! When I bought this album for myself and my mother we said \\"This album is amazing\\". This album is worth buying !<br />My favorite songs<br />Lost in paradise<br />Swimming Home<br />My heart is broken<br />What you want<br />Oceans<br /><br />and from the deluxe version<br />disappear<br />secret door<br />new way to bleed and<br />say you will =D
B0063M22QO|5.0|I got this program for a couple reasons.  Number one, I'm 77 years old, and<br />I hope to keep my brain functioning continuously.  This program does that.<br />It is user friendly and easy to follow.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I have been a Christina Aguilera fan since I first heard her song Genie In A Bottle up until now she has been the far most Inspirational artists. Her latest album Lotus is such a powerful album. When you listen to the words with your HEART and BEILEVE them in your mind you can feel the powerful songs that make you feel like you're capable of doing anything in your life.<br />for example...<br /><br />1st track Lotus (Intro) that song speaks to your spirit within telling you \\"RISE UP LOUTS RISE THIS IS THE BEGGINIG...\\" Rise to the sky and shine bright let NO ONE and let NOTHING stop you from rising out of the darkness into the light! If you want something that badly than you go for and keep on RISING!<br /><br />(My Favorite song from off the whole album) 2nd Track Army Of Me that song really is beautiful and very powerful as well Christina has called it Fighter 2.0 because when you listen to that song it's speaking to you LET NO NOTHING AND NO ONE EVER STOP YOU FROM FULFILLING YOUR DREAMS AND GOALS in your life. YOU STRONG NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY OR THINK. SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE AN ARMY AN AMRY OF ME!<br /><br />Buy this album trust me it's really worth it very beautiful and extremely powerful! Louts is so worth it and it makes a great present and gift to a friend and or family member :)<br />My friend bought me Lotus the standard version as a Christmas present last year and I love it I also love the deluxe as well :)<br /><br />My top 5 songs<br />1 Army Of Me<br />2 Let there be love<br />3 Empty words (Deluxe)<br />4 Blank Page<br />5 Best of me<br />I love Christina Aguilera and always will <3
B004P1JEWU|4.0|I am not normally a fantasy reader but these books are so well written and the whole story so well crafted that I am engrossed in the series.  A great read.
1463707606|4.0|I like the book. It has a variety of kusudamas that I like. The instructions are very simple and the way to assembly the moduls are very clear, but it will be better to find color photographies.
B004SI8WX2|5.0|If you're into a book that is spiritual in nature, not preachy but just a most informative read that at the end makes you look at your relationship with others, but most of all, the planet.  I got it to give as a gift because I had just read it for the second time.
B000GOVU3G|5.0|Great movie !!<br />My 7 year old along with everyone else loved the movie! My son wants a  a puppy!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy all of N Sparks stories! Definitely recommend.  All of Sparks stories have never disappointed me. Constantly look forward to the next publishing!
0307592731|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to my daughter. She loved the book and had a difficult time putting it down. I am due to read it now.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|It can store many cars, and my son still loves to play with it, also it can last very long
B002DY9QAG|5.0|Excellent book! In fact, all the books so far are awesome! Loved this book! Cant wait for the movie to come out!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Wish it was longer or I wish there was a part two it would make a sweet present for my kids
B00000JNO1|5.0|I love Lynyrd Skynard and had owned this CD in the past but wore it completely out. This replaced my old one that wouldn't play anymore. I have no problem with the product shipping or transaction it all went smoothly.
1416972250|5.0|Even better than the second book and just as good as the first. I'm glad I kept going with the series to get to City of Glass!
B00130UFY2|5.0|If you liked the first movie, you'll probably like this one too. The beginning is a little confusing if you have just watched the second movie, I think, but it's a great movie nonetheless. Action packed and very well done, just like the first two in this trilogy of movies. This is one of my favorite trilogies, and I highly recommend for fans of action and intrigue - though I know you'll get the most from these if you watch them in the correct order.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Difficult to use the kindle efficiently without it. The color compliments my kindle and the touch sensitivity allows me to open various files and bookmark easily.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|This movie is action-packed, very well done, and not disappointing. It's just as good as the first, in that it's a continuation of the first. The movies are a lot alike, so if you liked The Bourne Identity, you'll like this one just as well - at least, I did. I highly recommend for fans of intriguing action, though I also recommend you watch the first one first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great fun game. It really helps to pass the time when your waiting, it also keeps the kids/grandkids busy in the car on a long trip.
B000BYRD6Y|5.0|Amazing sound, super good deal. Love Vinyl!!! You can't beat the price for such a great album, I will gladly do business again in the future
B003PBB4ME|5.0|It's light, good price, and I like how comfortable it is to hold. I make short videos and this helped me with shots I had to run around with. This is great for novice movie makers like myself.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|My oldest daughter and I like to work on the puzzles together.  We enjoyed this game very much and are looking forward to the sequel.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Gaga does not diassapoint with her first Single from ARTPOP, Which will be available 11/11. And<br />Can be pre-ordred Paws up
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This app is pretty cool I just don't like how there is a ad so many times in the game, other than that, this is a really cool and fun app that anyone can play and have fun with!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|this app is a waste of time you can edit the photo chosen from ur gallery or take a pic put when u click save no matter what it says it NEVER saves the photo and I wouldn't get it if u have a kindle fire because there is no camera or is there?????
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Good movie even though Tom Cruise was in it. It was believable for the most part. Hope they make more.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This USED to be the best weather app. Now, after latest update, it's the worst.Can we get the old version back. If not, I'm uninstalling.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|What you would expect from Clancy.  Well told story that keeps your blood pumping.  You will not be disappointed, outstanding!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I would have given this a higher rating if it wasn't for some of the unnecessary harsh language. Nice entertainment for mid-30's and up. Keep the kids away from this movie.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|The first Gangstar I played was Gangstar Rio. I lovede the game play, its music, and its controls. So I am thinking: same company...same, if not better play, right? Wrong! Although the graphics blew Rio out of the water, the controls just stink! Maybe I'd feel different if I'd played this first. However, I was driving cars, SeaDoos, city buses, motorcycles, etc in the Rio game immediately - with no training or adjusting! Even trying to run up and punch someone was too mcuh of a chore. I spent way too much time trying to adjust the tilt for this game and never could get it right. Sometimes it seemed like I could tilt right to turn left. And just as I got used to that, tilting right would send me right. I tried using the arrows but my fingers would inevitably move off the arrow and I'd lose control. I see that a lot of people loved it but for me, it was just okay...at best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn takes the reader on a whirlwind of curiosity, wonderment, love and hate for Nick and Amy. The reader will never predict how the story ends. A thrilling and fun read.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show and it seems that every season only gets better.  I laughed so much, I thought I was going to break a rib!  They just need to get Raj a girl and even things out.  Someone totally opposite of the other ladies to keep it interesting.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Wow this music is awesome. Its very rare that i buy an album and like every song on it. However, Florida Georgia Line did it with this set. The title track is my favorite song, can't wait till they start playing it on the radio too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I might be the mom of the household but I love this movie.  If my children were still little I wouldn't mind if this got played over and over.  Minions are one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time! Though it still has a family story line about change and love when you don't want or expect it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book will make you question and second guess everything. It is a thrilling tale. It is one of the first sci-fi books I  have read, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing the upcoming movie.
B00EEXPDTM|4.0|I'll be honest I didn't totally know what to expect except I've seen Amanda Seyfried doing her publicity rounds promoting this movie and I found the story to be interesting.  I then caught a documentary out of the blue last night talking about the people involved, monies and the biggest loser in the game of course was Linda Lovelace.  Her name was known everywhere after making her first adult film \\"Deep Throat\\"<br /><br />This dives into how she went from a fairly sweet girl to being manipulated and abused by her \\"husband\\" that introduces her into porn.  Men around her make thousands if not millions of dollars in profit for the movie Deep Throat she made $1250.<br /><br />With help and strength she got away from her husband to later advocate for abused and exploited woman. Sadly she died in a car accident penniless.<br /><br />It shows on so many levels how in the 70's and going on today the Pornography industry makes millions off the back of woman and is not a victimless crime. I'm fully aware that companies try to keep their noses clean,try to protect there stars but this isn't where most of these issues come in.  With our access to the internet has stirred up the hornets nest of all the things being put online.  No one can regulate someone in a foreign country who is kidnapping and drugging children then having them \\"perform\\" for the camera or webcams.<br /><br />There our baked breasts and a husband and wife naked in med but mostly covering everything except a shot of Amanda's breast. You don't really see the full acts being portrayed in the movie just bobbing heads and heads blocking between lags.<br />Lots of drug use; marijuana and cocaine.  Many scene's of physical and sexual abuse as well as her husband basically selling her to pay back his debts and leaves her in a room with about 5 or 6 Hollywood business men who basically gang rape her for money.<br /><br />I actully think with good conversations people should see this to discuss sexual abuse, physical and emotional abuse (towards men and woman).<br />I will talk about this movie and recommend it for years to come!!<br /><br />Many well known actors in this movie with lovely 70's polyester suits. James Franco is Hugh Hefner,Sharon Stone as Linda's mother Dorothy, Robert Patrick as Linda's father John, Chris Noth plays a financier of the movie, Hank Azaria as I believe the director but you barely could tell who it was under the great make-up and costuming.nd emotional abuse (towards men and woman).<br />I will talk about this movie and recommend it for years to come!!<br /><br />Many well known actors in this movie with lovely 70's polyester suits.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I am very happy with this new CD by the Backtreet Boys. They have always made great songs that werent about inappropriate subjects, and continue on with this trend! They have changed their sound from the earliest days of the band, and it has brought the group continued success. Although I am still listening to it, my favorite song is \\"Madaline.\\"
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I was reluctant to see this at first but had seen the minions everywhere.  When I saw it I knew why it was so popular.  Adorable movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great app, decent amount of fun for those that enjoy HO games. I play in between my other games, to let this one recharge, and I haven't spent a dime. There are no issues from me, I think this will be on my kindle fire for the long term. Since it's free, there is no reason to let this pass :)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I read this for book club. I did not vote for it and was not sure I wanted to read about this subject. However, I did like it quite well. It sure did make me think of the young women in Cleveland who were kidnapped and especially the little girl born to one of them.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This has already been a free app of the day before. It is a nice app, just not sure why amazon is making it their free app of the day again.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This is the second time this has been a FAOTD.... I really haven't used it in a while due to bugs but...
B006LSZECO|5.0|not super happy with ending but overall excellent. writing was suberb. so well thought out. a little funny. no loose ends left. great
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Wow, what a great read.  If you love/like flowers it will be very intriguing.  Also I couldn't wait to find out what happened t the main character.
0385349947|5.0|As a mother of two and a professional, I was inspired by the message....take on leadership roles and work with your spouse or partner to balance the responsibilities to be successful at work and home.  Great message and with funny stories!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I was hesitant to get this app, because some people said you had to get the full version to get an alarm, but that isn't true. I usually use my cell phone and this is a great backup to have. The adds aren't all that bad they really only pop up when you first turn it on or change a setting.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you like Tarrantino, justice and a twist on good guys finish last, you're in for a ride.  Great addition to the collection.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I hear from many people that Blink-182 is such a great punk rock act, and this album proves its likelihood for many fans of punk rock. This album is an instant classic for music lovers. Starting with \\"Dumpweed\\" and ending with \\"Anthem\\", this album proves that their peak in punk rock is right here.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is a very talented new comer.  Her music never gets old and is popular among all age groups.  Her music and concerts are full of energy.
B004259BMM|2.0|The first thing that will be included is that this doesn't really seem like a good change in Keith Urbans career. One problem is that most of the songs sound exactly like songs off of his last record \\"Defying Gravity\\". The difference is that while those songs are pretty average with \\"Kiss a Girl\\", \\"Sweet Thing\\", and \\"Only You Can Love Me This Way\\" being good songs, those songs are much original than on this record titled \\"Get Closer\\". This is except for \\"Without You\\", the only song here that I site as average, which is also the only song that sounds like something new. \\"Long Hot Summer\\" is kind of different but still is marginal due to this sounding somewhat the same as \\"Kiss a Girl\\".<br /><br />Another problem that I have is that \\"You Gonna Fly\\", another song that is completely different from the other tracks, is different in a shockingly awkward way. Like the Guns n Roses song \\"Paradise City\\", you can clearly hear a whistle before the first chorus. The only thing that is supposed to include whistles is sports (football, basketball, soccer, ETC), not in music, although some other artists break those standards. Also, this song sounds like nothing that Keith Urban would (or is supposed to) do. I get Axl Rose, but why did Keith Urban use a whistle in this song, and in THIS song? This songs pros include having a catchy beat and alright guitar riffs. This song would be one of my favorite country songs ever if the whistle was omitted from the song.<br /><br />Another problem is that this album has only eight tracks, and its Deluxe Edition is only available at Target. The Deluxe Edition includes seven extras tracks (three new songs and four pointless live tracks). Without the live tracks, why couldn't the album have those three new tracks added to the track list and be sold everywhere and not just Target? This is another reason why this is the Australian country singers not-so-good side. This album basically feels like a EP done pointlessly.<br /><br />For anyone who reads this review, if you want a good CD from Keith Urban or new music, I prefer you don't look here unless you are willing to except the cons. If new, wait for his new record \\"Fuse\\" to come out in three weeks, or just simply get \\"Defying Gravity\\", or go to an album like \\"Be Here\\" or \\"Golden Road\\".s this review, if you want a good CD from Keith Urban or new music, I prefer you don't look here unless you are willing to except the cons.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a great book to read for book club- lots of drama and character development, as well as social factors that readers have to acknowledge to fully comprehend the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was thrilling and in every chapter was something new and exciting i couldnt put it down i hope the next book is even better i give this book five stars
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This was a great night with fantastic musicians playing their hearts out for an overflow crowd. Highly recommended of great historical content..
B004ZZFMTK|4.0|I gave the Mastering the Art of  French Cooking Volumes 1 & 2 away as I like [[ASIN:0679747656 The Way to Cook]] far better than Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Why? The Art of French Cooking is a breakthrough cookbook that opened the eyes of Americans to gourmet cooking. Watching the television show The French Chef hosted by Child helped too, and I am sure The French Chef would have never been created without her cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  The book Mastering the Art of French Cooking may have been a breakthrough cookbook, but a good chunk of the recipes are complicated. I love her cookbook The Way to Cook as Child's, as her later cookbook still offers excellent recipes which are a bit more modern in taste, and a bit easier to prepare.<br /><br />I do recommend Mastering the Art of French Cooking, if you wish to develop a strong foundation of cooking skills as this cookbook will teach you how to cook. If you already understand kitchen basics and are looking for simplified recipes, The Way to Cook cookbook might your cookbook of choice.<br /><br />Recommend.
B00454U1NS|5.0|This CD includes songs from her Can't take me home CD and ends before her True Love CD. The CD displays her maturity as a song writer. P!nk fans will love it. I bought it to add to my music collection.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|This was overall a fun movie, however a bit of a let down because most of the action takes place in the Sugar Rush world which is mostly about candy (in video game format). I was hoping for more video game worlds like dig-dug, pitfall, Halo, etc. There are some cool moments in the beginning of the movie but then it becomes a one-note and predictive plot line. I also thought there would be better use of classic and modern video game characters. At the end it gets too cutesy and reminds you it's a Disney movie.
B00004RHZU|4.0|If you're a Pink fan you will love her Ol' School CD. I bought this after attending a concert. I needed this to complete her collection.
B000IDEORY|5.0|A great story about love and pre-judging people before you know them. Wonderful music, actors, and storyline. A feel good movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book in middle school at the recommendation of a teacher. It hooked me on science fiction like a gateway drug, leading to authors like Clark and Asimov.<br /><br />There is a great story here from a perspective you don't see a lot of.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|All of the Downtown Abbey seasons are wonderful, yet in season 3 the series really starts to take off and several characters develop substance.  Maybe Anna and Bartes will become less boring in season 4.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|As a basis for evaluation, I am a graphics professional with a degree in animation technology. I'm finding this app simple and intuitive. For a mobile editing app, it has some good options. While not a replacement for a full featured editing suite I an preferring it to the mobile Photoshop if for no other reason than the ability to zoom in to see the effects of your adjustments while making them. Pretty easy to upload to Facebook as well for those who will tend to do that. So far no glaring issues of concern. Recommended, especially as a free app of the day.
B00E5BQ9SW|4.0|Don't pay attention to all the whiners who simply forgot to pre-order or don't know to order it directly from the source (screenarchives).  I write reviews for another site and here is a summarized paragraph from my review to show how excellent this title is.<br /><br />Most people would agree that Brian DePalma's two most controversial films were Scarface and Body Double.  Scarface of course for mountains of coke and using the \\"f\\" word over two hundred times while Body Double was more controversial for its nudity and its poking fun at Hollywood.  Over twenty five years later, the film has become a cult classic.  Even though it was never going to win a Oscar (it actually ended up winning a Razzie), it is plenty of fun and a complete guilty pleasure.<br /><br />For those who are looking for a review of the actual blu-ray (if you happen to be fortunate enough to get a copy), the video is excellent and this is certainly the best it has looked ever far outpacing the mediocre dvd.  The audio is also very good and is even throughout, it never gets too loud or too soft once you set your volume.  The only new extra here is the isolated score by Pino Donaggio while it retains the excellent special edition dvd featurettes.  It also comes with a nice eight page insert if you are into that sort of thing.  I don't know if it is worth the $100 price that the scalpers will try to sell it at but it is well worth the price that Twilight Time normally charges.<br /><br />Twilight Time puts out a lot of great titles and often they don't sell out right away.  Body Double just happens to be one of those popular titles among cult fans like me that was not going to stay available for very long.

B00BOX0K0M|1.0|Needed a good polarized filter solution for my new Hero 3 and this was a total disappointment.<br />The filter snaps on fine, but the filter material is very inconsistent. If you look through the filter while holding it upto your eye you'll notice how the plastic makes the visuals look all wavy showing how low the quality the plastic really is. Crappy product.<br />Go with the circular glass Tiffen filter solution. Many companies making this type of adapter these days.
B00A5FPQBI|5.0|Wow, what can I say I just love reggae, KY Mani Marley is to sexy to me. I love his music, the rest of the actors all did a great good in this movie .I've  watched this movie I bet 20 times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You can see the differences between the uppers in the home and the lowers.  It is not something that changes easily.  But with the changes in the 20's, comes the &#34;New Rich&#34;, and modernizations, many do not like what is happening to Abbey.  * Spoiler* And then comes Mathews death... Why??  I am still wondering.  Why???  It did not have to happen to change the story.  I did not write the story line, I know.  But I feel like they threw it in...
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and the village customs.  Great to see DAWN FRENCH...she always adds spice to the situation.  Also great to see the guy from Downton Abby.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like the options on this game, but using only a SmartPhone, it's a bit small to do anything rapidly.  I'll keep playing it, and wishing I had a tablet!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Best photo editor app I have found yet. I have used over twenty photo editors, and none have been as great as this one. It allows layers, text, and sketching on the photos, among many other phenomenal photo modification features. Truly an amazing editor.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I'm kind of addicted to this game on my computer.  The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star here is because I'm using this app on a SmartPhone and it's a bit small on my screen.  But I'm still using it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book taught me so much about Tesla and the War of Currents . It was a really good book .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best game I played myself. Lots of new features come from time to time. Quick download and cool things! U should probably change to different countries. Very fun and addictive,so have fun with this free game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Loved the twists and turns in this movie. Action packed and Tom Crusie was terrific. Rent the movie it is worth it!
B007JZGIMS|5.0|Very nice app, brought unlock key, but if I don't use my tablet and shut it down overnight, when I do open it, the app comes up with, \\"...must be connected to the internet\\", when I start it.  Sometimes, that's not always possible to be attached to the internet, say with wi-fi.  This is an annoying problem that seriously impacts an otherwise excellent music app.  Please fix this... not everybody can be connected to the internet or wi-fi all of the time.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />Issue appears to have been corrected.  App is now working Excellent.  My sincere thanks to the developers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game and I play it a lot and I get diamond's. a lot when I play pe
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although this book is classified as young adult, it held the attention of this adult reader.  It's a very quick read that touches your heart. Several reviews found the dialogue to be inconsistent with our perception of teens, but I didn't find that to be problematic. In fact, these characters are teens who deserve to be a bit melodramatic, given their situations. I thought it was well written, and I'd recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great free game, I Can't wait for more floors in the future, it is a way to keep you on the edge trying to find the next clue.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman uses a lot of different formats for his art, but nothing beats the old-fashioned NOVEL! This story is one for both young adults and those more worldly-wise.
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|I love it. It is exactly what i wanted to have to listen to. I might just get more later on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I heard about the premise of this series,I was very skeptical...a story about 10-17 year olds fighting to the death? But a friend convinced me to try it....I read all three books in 4 days! They are completely addicting hey pull you into the story,and don't let you go.I highly recommend these books!
B000J025AE|1.0|This is the first time we have rented, and the movie froze halfway through.  We will never rent again through Amazon.
B000TERG6S|5.0|The song of the guitar done right. If you enjoy the music without words covering it up then Jessie Cook is for you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minions in minion rush you can change where they are and you can change characters from a regular minion to a reforee to a mom to anything it like temple run but way better
B001URCM44|5.0|I have been a Yanni fan for a very long time. His music comes from somewhere other than his head. The ochestral arrangements are a fantastic jouney. Listen loud in the dark of the night, close your eyes and fly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the most realistic house game there is next to owning your own. I'm 32 and I like this game more than my own daughter.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|great cd all the way around about 5 to 7 really good songs very happy with it & price was reasonable
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game, very addicting and fun. My kids love  playing this game and its easy to play even a 2 year old can do it
B004I744AS|5.0|I didn't honestly expect much of this online dictionary, which I'm using to expand my German vocabulary.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the clear listing of multiple definitions for the same word, the examples of these definitions in sentences, and the thesaurus feature.  If I wanted to double check my understanding of the German definitions, I could scroll down easily to a translator feature.  Nicely done!
0307476073|2.0|It seems like people who have read \\"Wild\\" either love it or hate it. Unfortunately I fall into the latter camp. I had high hopes, based on other reviews and the fact that I love hiking, nature, and the twists and turns of self-discovery. I made it through the first few chapters, and then just couldn't maintain interest. Strayed is a very gifted writer. But, at least in this book, she's also a narcissistic, magical thinking drama queen of epic proportions. And in my world, that gets boring in a hurry.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will be searching for more games that are similar. It was nice and long, had an interesting story, and great graphics. Keep 'em coming!
B002JCSWVG|5.0|The crazy part to me was watching a &#34;30 for 30&#34; about this. It interviewed the Rugby players from South Africa and these guys were so moved by this that when they talk about it they are in tears. When you see a 275lb Giant completely moved by Mandela and the unity behind what they accomplished; then you are moved and touched in a way that words can't describe.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I could not get this app to work,.,, it says service disconnected,... does it require ports open? i have all outbound ports open on my firewall but it still does not work

B0029LCJJS|5.0|The show is kind of dark but I really like it! I had no idea it was going to be this good!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|Strange music weird band but have to say i really like the CD.  Soundscapes and melodies encompass the entire CD.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|For the price, this cover does what it needs to do.  It holds the Kindle firmly in place and provides some protection, nothing fancy. Also helps to make the Kindle feel a little more like opening a book (a little bonus I like).
159562015X|5.0|I ordered several copies and shared them with my co-workers. We all found the book to be a useful tool in both our daily and professional lives.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Wow Osmos HD is a great game, fun to play and will keep you entertained for hours and hours.  Oh yea, the music is great, best if you use headphones.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Lot's of fun with his chacter's son. Jumping right into trouble, where he shouldn't be. True to the franchise. Fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Continues the outstanding work of the first two seasons.  Must be seen; do not miss the two recap videos--they help a lot.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|do you know I am hard hearing so I love listen to loud music and this album have awesome beats that can make you dance hard. indeed it is kinda techno. Come on, release your energy out so you can sleep good.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Really?!?!! My favorite character, the one with the most charm and intelligence gets unceremoniously killed in a car wreck just after seeing his newborn son?! You writers have no soul!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's nice to wake up in the morning and not have to turn on the television to find out the weather for the day.  Very convenient in the winter if you have to drive to work.  The forecast is always accurate.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Pleasant action movie.  Makes you want to go back and revisit the individual films of the action heroes.  Highly recommend it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|FireFly ranks with the Outer Limits, Battlestar Galatica, Fringe. There isn't an ounce of sloppy, soupy story telling or acting.The characters are believeable, humorous, intellegent, at times wacky, unpredictable, loyal; in short comrads in raucous adventures that hold your attention show after show. Although there are only 14 productions, I enjoy viewing the shows again and again. The executives that cut this series committed a huge blunder!
B00CL68NOG|2.0|This movie was w-a-y worse... its like the movie never got outta first gear. Also, there was zero connection between our traveling superstars (both of whom I love).
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie for me was mediocre, but I was surprised at the great streaming quality from my PS3.  It looked and sounded great!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I know, people say this all the time, but I really couldn't put this book down. I thought it was original and well-written.  Was it a bit predicable? Hmmm, maybe a tad, but that didn't stop me from liking this book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Game of Thrones is EXCELLENT!  So excited to get at a reduced price and be able to enjoy anytime i want!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|A book I REALLY couldn't put down! I hope when they release the movie it is not produced in the same tired fashion as many of King's movies are made.  (Think of all the BAD King movies that went straight to TV.)
B0073V7YTY|4.0|This is not a pro tool but I compared several readings to my actual Db meter and the app was very close.  You can not set response (fast/slow) or weighting but in most uses this should suffice nicely.
B008Y7D4FY|4.0|I liked this one.  I like horror movies, and was tired of the same ole' (i.e.housebreak ins, zombie, etc).  It was a good watch.
B00821OX98|4.0|Love Noah Wiley, which is why I was interested in the first place. I don't typically watch sci-fi, but the storyline is good.  Acting is good.  My husband loves this show.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it but I can't get to realms it won't let me I have a mojang account and no let me in wtsf
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Great 4cd set of a great band! You gotta get this one if you are into classic rock, that's for sure!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I know Matthew had to be eliminated but so sorry to see him go. He was my favorite character;however, I understand Dan Stevens reasoning behind his departure. I am sure Downton Abbey will continue to be a very enjoyable series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was hooked after 1st episode in season 1. Now i am on season 3. Great show! I highly reccomend it.
1401938906|1.0|The author, apparently who is also a freelance journalist, includes a very worthy quotation in this book: \\" Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, None but ourselves can free our mines\\"  Worthy words indeed but the author sites a bumper sticker!  Come on! All you have to do to ATTEMPT to find out where those word came from is Google emancipate and up pops the first line of the quotation and what do you find: they are words in #66 of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  These words were used by Bob Marley in his goodbye song called \\"Redemption Song\\".  Listen to it on You Tube ... it will touch your soul.  According to his wife, he was writing this song when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.<br />I'd forgive the author if she had accepted Marley as the source but if you dig further, and search for more info about Redemption Song, you find that these words were delivered by a Jamaican politician called Marcus Garvey and were spoken at Sydney, Nova Scotia in Canada in July 1938.  He said: \\"We are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind\\"<br />Google Marcus Garvey Nova Scotia to read his whole speech ... it is well worth the read!<br />I haven't read all of this book yet but the one star is for this lack of integrity.[[ASIN:B00B2JSRAS E-Squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality]]

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was an awesome book....I couldn't put it down! I'm anxious to read the next book in the crossfire series! There are so many questions still left unanswered. Can anyone tell me when it's due out? I can't wait to read more about Eva and Gideon!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Decent calculator app. Easy use, big buttons and screen. Comes in handy at work, home, and at school. Plus its free so big bonus.

0385342063|4.0|Typical of her books, easy read with several laughs thrown in to boot. This is the type of book I wold recommend to all my friends. Everyone needs a fun book to lighten up your mood and Sophie Kinsella has done it again
B001I45UFC|4.0|I give this book a 4.<br />I loved the hole book. I never wanted to stop reading it. This was the best book I read.
1452000247|5.0|Without doubt, this is one of the sweetest, darkest and strangest stories I have ever read. So much like Alice in Wonderland and the Lion, Witch & Wardrobe with dark and crazy thrown in! Right from the start, I was pulled into the pages of Peter's world. I still can't stop thinking about all the strange characters and how I want to be part of their world. I am getting giddy just thinking about those places again. I hope there will be more adventures or other stories from this author. The beautiful, natural and descriptive writing is unbelievable - from Mr. Twindle Twondle the mouse, Slip the elf, and Kiylore the dragon. I loved it all! Also, at the end of this magical, fantasy world, there are lovely poems about all the characters. Thank you, William, for inviting me into your world!
B000009EO5|5.0|It was a gift to someone who loves the movie. The person thinks I is the greatest  disc ever! Glad I found it for her.

B007FZVWFA|4.0|I liked this movie even though I hadn't heard of it. I saw a trailer and thought why not. Its actually kind of short and the story line is left wanting but I still liked it, maybe just because of the aliens; really everything else was a little far fetched.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a very well written book on as much as is known or can be surmised about the historical Jesus.  The author is very honest about what is known and not known, and he is thorough in describing and explaining the circumstances under which Jesus was born, where he worked, and why and how he died.  I am glad I read this book; it certainly makes the historical Jesus a very appealing figure.
B008220BLG|4.0|The premise may sound ridiculous but this is (for me) a different and lovely romantic film which happens to have zombies, I really don't get tired of watching it and ended up loving Nicholas Hoult
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Thank you very much.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|This is a film that all the family can enjoy, and if you like Glee this you'll like...it's not a musical but a film that shows the college acapella world, with fun, romance and a lot of talent...this is a sweet change from all the blockbuster films with lots of special effects, violence, sex and no real emotion
B007D2XSW0|4.0|EDIT:The new version saves fine.  Lots of filters.  Not sure how practical it is, but it is definitely fun.<br /><br />(The previous version did not save.  I am glad the developer fixed this. )

0938045695|3.0|Good info if you can get past the constant barrage of Russian lingo and endless attempts to sell you on kettlebells. Kind of corny most of the way through but the instructions are detailed and the pictures help.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was unexpectedly funny!  The whole family loved it.  Lots of really good one-liners that cant be quoted again and again in many situations. Light hearted feel good movie.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This was a great movie loved it the kids enjoyed it very much kept the whole family entertained, especially the grown ups

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I Really Love this Game Its Soo Good It really Gets Yah Thinking Foreal Yeaaa Goo Gmaee Go Gammeee Gammee Gamme Gammme
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious.  Plus there's super amazing singing throughout.  The arrangements are surprising and delightful and the actors play well off each other.  Rebel Wilson SHINES and is hilarious in this movie.  I can watch it over and over.
0547848412|5.0|different from screenplay so being my son had seen the flick he was confused by the differences in it to the movie!!
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|Not what I would typically think a G5 game would be. The storyline was slow and didn't make much sense, and the game is just one long hidden objects game.  Come on G5!!!! Where's the better games?!?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this book because after losing my husband in December, I have found myself drawn to YA fiction. At first I thought that it was because YA tends to be lighter than adult fiction, but there is nothing light about this book.  It's simply a gorgeously written story about finding perfection in our faults.  The characters are richly drawn and I didn't want the book to end, ever.  I look forward to reading John Green's other books.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Got this app free in Amazon Appstore.<br />It is easy to mark around photo. But after spending the time editing, I cannot save the result. No warning msg, it behaves like it saved your work but it didn't.<br />I'll remove it right after this review.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Like the story line so far.  Jury is still out on whether it will hold my interest.  If it journeys off into &#34;cause&#34; scripts I'm gone.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|good game but stuck in el machos lair. wish that the tokens would be awarded for missions beat. maybe the next update?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel\\" is a wonderful tale about one magical spring in the life of a seven year old boy (we never get his name) who serves as the narrator of the story in an extended flashback some 40 or more years later.  It is a story about childhood memories and growing up and the ease with which magic is accepted unquestioningly by children.  No one comes to the narrator's 7th birthday party, which upsets him not at all, as he is rather bookish, without many friends outside the covers of his books.  One day a tragedy occasions his meeting 11 year old Lettie Hempstock and her mother and grandmother.  The Hempstocks are quickly revealed to be a most unusual family, living on a most unusual farm, with a most unusual pond (the ocean of the title) at the end of a lane.<br /><br />The story is a novel, the title tells us so, but it is very short at 236 pages on my iPad, and reads even shorter.  It felt like a novella, lacking the complexity and depth of a novel.  But it was a wonderful read, totally self-contained, and leaving behind smiles and a good feeling.  It is billed as an adult novel - the narrator is a grown man escaping from a funeral that has brought him back to his homeland - but he recounts an adventure that he had as a child, completely unselfconsciously and unapologetically.  I recently read Gaiman's \\"The Graveyard Book\\" that I enjoyed, but that was clearly written for a young adult audience.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is just as clearly written for an adult audience, but is totally suitable for children and young adults as well.  There is nothing to offend anyone here, and I intend to have our 12 year old read it (He also read The Graveyard Book).<br /><br />Neil Gaiman is a talented writer.  While this one does not have the power of American Gods or Anansi Boys, it is suffused with metaphor and lessons about friendship, love and sacrifice and Gaiman's own unique take on the nature of the universe.  It is elegant in its simplicity.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />J.M. Tepperlicity.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />J.M. Tepper
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I like the flashing colors as it changes to the next level.  It's challenging and a little hard to understand how it really works.  The instructions were a little vague.  Over all, I like it and it's a great way to pass some time.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Since this is the first in what apparently will be a series, so I forgive the devs the error of making a game that is simply too short for the average game aficionado. Nevertheless, the game is engaging and reasonably challenging for those who like puzzles. Some of the hints came functionally too late, since you are required at times to manipulate the puzzle to find the next clue, but then you may stumble upon the answer before the clue activates. All in all, the game is entertaining, and I would play the next one in the series.
B003SI9WMS|5.0|Great story, superb acting, and a great setting.  You will literally have your mind blown after watching this movie.  Not hard science, but who cares?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read it! You won't be sorry.<br />It was a quick and interesting read. My co-workers and I read it together.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed these books! I read them on hard back and when this trilogy came on sale and had to buy them!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A must read. This one is going into my archives<br />Right along with the Trilogy of 50 Shades of Grey.
B009AP2G26|5.0|We really enjoy watching Glee. We missed the tv episode and this was very helpful to watch to catch up.
1933952806|5.0|Easy to read and understand. I am using this, along with David Busch's Compact Field Guide For the Nikon D7000, to work  my way through the task of learning all the functions and capabilities of the D7000. Very  helpful.
0374203032|3.0|Though I have been aware of the author, I haven't ever read anything else that he had written previousley.<br />He is a clear, concise writer, and obviously a smart man.<br /><br />There's something missing here, and I don't know what.  Maybe I misread the work, but this book felt a little episodic.  There are specific instances that meet the criteria of the title, but I didn't get a sense of a larger, over-arching argument.  Maybe that's just a genre convention, but I felt cheated when I came to the end.  The reader is expecting the author to tie it all together with recommendations for policy or what have you, but for me it just ended.<br /><br />This book is thin already at 203 pages, and a fairly wide spacing of the text.  It felt like the argument is thin as well.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I only started watching this series in the middle of the Fourth Season.  I always wanted to catch up because of Nathan he is fantastic and I enjoy watching this show and to add these Seasons to my collection.  This is a series that should never end
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This is a good super hero movie, its too violent for kids under 13 for sure. The movie of course is an aggresive batman with some blood scenes.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I only started watching this series in the middle of the Fourth Season.  I always wanted to catch up because of Nathan he is fantastic and I enjoy watching this show and to add these Seasons to my collection.  This is a series that should never end.
B002LANLDK|5.0|I like action flicks and this one doesnt disappoint. Some scenes are a little far fetched but hey its a movie.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Her books is hysterical. If you enjoy Ellen DeGeneres, you will love this book. Each chapter is random and silly, it's a fun and fast read.
B006INDGFE|5.0|This movie is better than part one. The movie really keeps up the humor throughout and is full of situations that will make you laugh.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen Hoover's books are so much fun & so easy to dive into. I really enjoyed her characters, the books are so difficult to put down. I am reading them again for the second time. I highly recommend these books to anyone who is looking for a fun and romantic book to read.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is the best free product I have found! If you can enjoy the dull bits that do not pertain to the actual story line. Ex- battle of Waterloo and defeat of Napoleon don't affect Jean Valjean...this is a beautiful read
B000U6BT40|5.0|I miss shows like this. The sherif /dad isn't some bumbling fool who is constantly saved by his over achieving friends/family. Instead, he's a stand up role model, dealing with teen angst and \\"real\\" life. Good hearted humor and well written show. Actors are great and the plots always have a twist. Another show, like Firefly, I wish would have continued...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 6 year old and 4 year old grandchildren love this game. They try to see who can accumulate the most bananas and who can get to Vector first!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I got this app the last time it was offered as the FAOTD...  I hoped that the saving issue was resolved, alas not.<br />I can select custom and navigate to a known location and it will not save.<br />Removing this for now, again, and hope they work on this to fix the problems.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My grandchildren love this.  They really have to use their thought process to figure out the patterns. I enjoy this myself as well.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I love the functionality and options on the app itself, but what good is it to work with a pic if you CAN'T SAVE IT???<br />If this app would just save it might be the best pic app out there, but instead it is utterly useless as it is.<br />Do not pay for this app until it gets fixed!!!!!<br />I wish I could give this ZERO stars, but the lowest I can go is one.
1476727910|4.0|He turns words well and has a lot of humor. Had an easy, fun read. I recommend it with no reservations.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|A great end to David Tennants tenure of the Doctor. A who's who of companions and friends show up in this episode!
1781162646|5.0|For me, this was a very different kind of King novel. As always, the characters were strong & compelling. You get inside the characters! It's not a horror story at all, but you'll never forget it!
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|The pristine master is the same than the ones of the former edition, but 3 new documentaries were added. The two directed by John Little are very valuables. &#34;Wing Chun: The Art That Introduced Kung Fu to Bruce Lee&#34; gives us precious informations on the Yip Man school, presenting us the sifu Wong Shun Leung, the main instructor of Bruce Lee. &#34;Return to the Han's Island&#34; is a clip from a former J. Little documentary on the various location spots used in the Bruce Lee movies. And the selection of Bruce Lee goodies straight from the seventies is so fun !
B000GL1BHO|4.0|Oh, don't get me started on plastic pterosaurs. Toy sculptors will labour hours getting T-Rex just right but, when it comes to flying reptiles, they play mix and match with the body parts and say 'to hell' with the consequences.<br /><br />In fairness, this is a lovely-looking thing. The product photo doesn't do it justice. As with all Papo's beasties, the level of detail for the price is tremendous and the paintwork great. But...<br /><br />It's got a body like an over-muscled frog. The claws would look large on a dragon. Oh, and it's got teeth. Pteranodon means \\"winged and toothless\\".<br /><br />If this item was sold as a generic pterosaur, I'd turn a blind eye. But it's called a pteranodon when it isn't a pteranodon. It's a fictional mean-eyed toothy lizard bird.<br /><br />It's still nice, though. You're kids'll love it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I will begin by writing that I do love this series and have read some of the later novels before deciding to start at the beginning.  This novel was obviously early in character development and plot development.  While it was very good, it is not at the level Lee Child is now producing.  I did not want to put it down but was disappointed at some of the 'easy outs' the author took to move the characters from one sticky situation into the next.  I also thought that the end was short relative to all of the problems leading up to it.  I do recommend this book and am looking forward to going through the series.
B009EE0SC8|5.0|Hugh Jackman plays this role so well sometimes i swear i'm reading my old comic books again.  Great back story to understand why Wolverine is well like well the way he is.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|The only problem is the fairly consistent Amazon glitches/seizing up, but love the series!  Keep the Star Trek series available!
B006PAV1XO|3.0|So 80's campy.  you'd think not so predictable, but not a horrible movie, just not even close to a classic or anything
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Enjoyable and quick read. Very accessible and entertaining. Occasionally gets a bit slow, but overall worth it for the anecdotes and takeaways.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Many Christians would have a hard time accepting this historical account of the life of Jesus. That said I found it very interesting and for me explained a number of issues that I could not understand or could not believe about the Gospels.  Mr. Asian explains by using the historical facts the way things were when Jesus was born and lived.  For me it made the life of Jesus come alive and His humanity became real.  The way the Church doctrines developed over time is a result of of Jesus's life on earth as well as the influence of the scriptures.  My faith and believe in Jesus Christ is stronger as a result of reading this book and my tolerance for other faiths has been increased.  If you decide to read this book kneel down, pray and open your mind.  Do that and you will deepen your understanding of and believe in Jesus of Nazareth and in Jesus Christ.
B0000714BP|5.0|Wesley, Patrick and John did an awesome job playing these character roles that are so much not like them. This is a cool comedy and the story is so unique to me. It's filled with humor and some drama but is just an overall feel good kind of flick. The storyline is basically about when the odds are against you, do you run and hide or do you do what you have to to accomplish your goal? I just love this movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is just a great series.  Enjoyed every minute of it.  Took me a long time to get through all 3 years worth but at least now I will be caught up for this year.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Story lines are so original, super interesting characters, fantastic acting from everyone.  It's one of those series you wish you hadn't seen so you could watch it again with the same &#34;no way&#34; at every twist and turn. Can't wait for Season 2.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I felt personally involved with all of the characters in the book.  I appreciated the style of going from one thread of the weave to another very much like echoes bouncing from one Afghanni hill top to another.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the game. This is one of my favorites.  I have played this game for many years .  I even bought the game to download on my computer , but like it on my kindle as the kindle is easy to handle when you can take it with you.  This game has many different levels and a variety of different ways to play it.  I recommend this game to all.
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|Just discovered Hiromi. I am blown away. This is an amazing album. I'm looking forward to listening over and over again.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game is ok but doesn't have enough levels .  Makes for a short boring game. I love games like this but just is enough challenges for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Entertaining and just plain old fun..love it..enjoy the different levels..although the kids have favorite levels. It would be nice to be able to go back and replay levels.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have always had an interest in the truth about North Korea, the lives of the everyday person, what would my life be like if I had been born in North Korea. I found the novel wonderfully written, hard to put down. It transported me to North Korea and then put me in a barrel defecting to the USA.
0792839730|5.0|My Grandparents experienced some of the effects displayed in this movie. A Must see for all kids to show them that our freedom is something very valuable and that needs to be cherished
B006C67NP6|5.0|I have used this app so many times in so many places. There is nothing that comes close to accessibility and ease of use as this app. It has saved many a jam. Very versatile and you will never regret getting it!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gary's book is useful for loving relationships, but is also effective for all relationships. For instance, I was able to identify my teenager right away as a person who requires physical touch to feel cared for. Whenever she gets too &#34;teen-agery&#34; I hug her until she calms down. It works every time. And she is 16, so getting a hug out of her normally is like pulling teeth.<br /><br />I also found my partner to be the same. Physical touch like back rubs, or playing with his hair while we watch tv, make him feel loved. And he understands that I do love him, since I am giving him what he needs from me. This is important, as I used to be so confused about why the things I did that I thought were loving, seemed to be falling on deaf ears.<br /><br />I am having trouble identifying my own love language, as it seems to be falling into two categories, but I have talked to two girlfriends about this book (they both read it) and they have the same problem, so I will work through the book again, requesting from my partner things from each of the languages until we both identify which language is mine.<br /><br />This book is very helpful.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Different writing style but still engaging.  I couldn't put it down and the kids loved it.<br />Jackson is missing and you are involved with a whole new group heading for camp half-blood.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|The movie had good special effects, acting decent, plot ok.  The movie did seem to move slow for an action movie.  Overall it was decent, but I wouldn't call it a must see movie.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|loved this game.it had every thing you want in a hidden object game plus a story line to follow. will look for more from them.
1550379151|5.0|This is just a classic -- I read this to my daughters when they were little girls, and they loved it.  I especially appreciated that this story instilled the concept of intelligence and independence in girls so many years ago.  I even bought a copy for myself once my daughters grew up and moved away!
B005FIO3PU|1.0|I needed a small desk lamp and loved the idea of plugging it into my computer.  Its very lightweight so it falls constantly, and doesn't shed enough light.  I now use it for when I'm doing my nails but even then its not really worth it....
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|An incredibly silly yet timeless mockery of many things. A must watch for many reasons. I laughed so hard i cried
B00006JSS8|5.0|Its very self explanatory with his classics from younger and thru the years. I have to make the requirement so i came up with this sentence.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|This song is interesting, and is Lady Gaga's lead single from her album ARTPOP slated for release in the fall. I was not immediately a huge fan, so it is one that will definitely have to grow on me. It's a definite grower. This is for sure a song that will be an instant hit in the clubs, and will be a great add to my workout playlist. On another note, I know this will be played on the radio, but I am not sure if radio will be kind enough to put this in heavy rotation. It's not an earth-shattering hit, but it's a different sound for Lady Gaga, and the charts will eat it up. I am still anticipating what else she brings to the table with ARTPOP.
B000IKQK7E|4.0|Great movie, just wish it was better quality. I have to make the requirement so i came up with this sentence.
B000JCQCW4|1.0|Similar to &#34;Traffic&#34; or &#34;Trainspotting&#34; but without any of the redeeming qualities like compelling characters or interesting plot. Afterwards I just wanted Agent K to hit me some sweet neuralizer relief.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|I first saw this movie when it first came out. There is plenty of action and substance to hold your interest.
B009A882D0|4.0|It's all good, there are some song's left out that i would have put in, but all in all a fine representation of the band and the time's!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|What an amazing life he had and what a legacy he leaves behind. I have and will reccommend this read to friends and family. It wil be on my list of gifts to give
B00CLD65X0|5.0|So excited that we could get Season 3 through my son's xbox and at no charge because we are prime members.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great action film which kept my interest the whole time. I want to watch Red 2 so was glad to have the opportunity to see Red prior to seeing Red 2.
0452284392|5.0|This book was in the condition as described. I am satisfied with the seller's description. The book reads like a textbook so if that's what you're after, you'll enjoy it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Super fan of Matthew McConaughey, awesome modern day Tom Sawyers / Huck Finn...<br />Great show, and I want a re-watch
B00AHHODH2|2.0|Terrible way to end this story.  I was just getting into the characters and plot, and it ended.  Totally incomplete.  What a waste of my reading time.  Very disappointing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app, probably the best weather app out there.  I have this on my phone, but it is better on the Fire, and far easier to read/see on the Fire.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The lives of two couples and their extended families are intertwined to an extent that includes the breakup longtime friendships and murder. The characters become real as questions are asked and life changing answers are revealed. A great read that is wonderfully crafted
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game, loads of fun, even better on the Fire than on a smart phone, larger and easier to see while you take out evil pigs!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you love the cheezy action flicks of the 1980's then you've alreayd seen the Expendables 2 and loved it. If you havn't seen it yet, give it a chance. It's bad guys are downright evil. The good guys are downright awesome and the dialogue is as cheeze as can be. Add on good production values and a great widescreen presentation and it's way better than searching for that old Delta Force VHS in the back of your crawlspace!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|What is not to love?  Angry birds . . . check.  Evil piggies to kill . . . check.  Add Star Wars powers to the birds . . . . awesome!
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is one of those products that, until you have used it, you didn't know you needed. The machined metal body combined with quality internals gives you intuitive control of your modelling, after about 2 days of practice. After that, you'll find yourself reaching for it constantly. I have used it in 3DS, Sketchup, Mudbox, and inventor, and it shines in them all.<br /><br />We have also integrated it into some custom work. The drivers for the software are easy to understand, and are readily accessed via Python or whatever.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds, in space, what is not to love?  Wonderful waste of time, even better on a Kindle fire, larger screen, no more squinting.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Amazingly candid insider view into the best rock band to ever exist. No other band has had the staying power of Rush, who remains relevant and creative after nearly 4 decades with the same three musicians. Also clearly shows how genuinely freindly they are, to fans and each other. They are the classiest, most talented, and most celebrated trio in rock history, and this is a fine tribute. How they got 8mm footage of Alex Lifeson meeting with his parents and a school counselor at age 16 or whatever, I will never know.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Hey, it works, and it is free.  What is not to like?  Thought it would be nice to have on the Fire, and  . . . it is.
B0026P7O6K|5.0|Great album. Not a song on the album I don't like. Would recommend to anyone who listens to rock or anyone period.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love ALL these Angry Birds games.  Far better on the Fire.  Larger screen = no more squinting.  I don't even play it on my phone anymore.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Another great album from Halestorm. Hard hitting album worthy of their Grammy. Would HIGHLY recommend. These guys do rock and are rock.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is a great game. The dragons and the scenery are beautiful. I love the way the dragons evolve from the temple. This game is so much fun.
B001M2CBRK|4.0|Almost anti-climatic ending, but bodes well with the story and the point. That war, there is no specific point, just many pieces and puzzles. I would say watch
B003719G40|5.0|Very interesting book for people who have relationships in their highest values. Not only intimate relationships the love languages can be applied to understand the dynamic between people in other circumstances as well.
B008A0LSZ8|5.0|This book did not start boring like other Stephen King books seem to, he just jumped right into the story. I had a hard time putting this book down! I enjoyed it so much I bought a copy for three of my friends to read. They enjoyed it and recommended it to their other friends too!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|You can blow dry, color with a paint brush thing, comb and cut the characters hair in differenet ways. Not much else to do unless you're going to spend $ to buy characters and other extras. My kids played it for a few days (mainly the blow dryer because you can blow the hair straight up and in silly ways) and then forgot about it and wanted a different app.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Reminded me of the Matrix mixed up with the Terminator. Has great action and characters but this plot has been done already.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun but tiny. hard to see with old eyes.<br />Gives the same reward more than once; doesn't give<br />what I need to continue. I think there are items you have to BUY:¢<br />Read some reviews from a year ago and those people were<br />Waiting for updates then! Appearently G5 has forgotten about this game.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Nice &quot;clean&quot;, smooth running app.  It hasn't found any problems yet so I don't know how effective it is.  Get it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I know this book has not received the best reviews from readers, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. it does have a slower start compared to Percy Jackson but once the action picks up it turns into a wirlwind that you will not want to put down. It switches point of view throughout the book so if you are not use to that style of writing it can be a little confusing. My advise just take your time while reading it. Other than that is a great book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This app needs to be divided.  The market place element needs to be completely separated from the play areas of the game, so that a kid (of any age) can play and not be duped into purchasing additional time, or games by accident.  This app can be hazardous to your pocketbook.  I do love the game, though, and my grandson loves playing it.  Even though he is seven, and I can steer him from making dangerous decisions about options he is presented with during the game, expensive accidents can happen.  Especially if I give him the game to play, and he plays without supervision for a short while.  It's a love-hate sort of thing about this app.
B009ZM74F8|3.0|It's okay, and definitely predictable, but had some good moments.  For sure you can compare it to &#34;The Matrix&#34; movies.
B00D3XAA4M|5.0|Some people love to travel, and do it as often as they can, or as often as their wallet can afford it.  Some people are afraid of travel, or have had unfortunate travel experiences or, perhaps, unfortunate expenses ....  This travel book by Lonely Planet has solutions to both kinds of misfortunes.  But, sometimes it's just fun to read about the experiences of travel, and, with help from ones imagination and the Internet, dream of what it might be like.  No pains, just gains!
0887081770|5.0|Very nice story that my three year old enjoys.  We got the small hardback version with the fold outs which makes it even nicer.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I have watched parts of one or two presentations on my KindleFire HD, and have seen the show on television a few times.  The content and the presenters are very interesting and provacative.  The programs cover a lot of ground in a very short time, and I never am disappointed, except that I wish I had more time to enjoy them.  This is one of my most valuable KindleFire apps.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The music was beautiful, the story was touching, and there was no embarrassing language.<br />I got a copy for my family.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|We just bought a mountain home.  As of yet no TV's.  Great to be able to watch movies using Amazon Prime on our iPad.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|it is the worst game i have ever played and i wish i could get my money back. simply horrible.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I saw the BBC documentary and was intrigued.  The intermittent fast makes sense, not only for losing weight but for living healthier as you live longer.  I feel better with three meals on fast days but have fewer calories so I have the 500.  I also keep to the 8 hours per day eating time which I find easier than eating only one or two meals.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|Who wouldn't want to watch these movies over and over again.  My daughter thought they were about the oceans of the world until she watched the first one with her grandma and now she's hooked.  Looking forward to watching 12 & 13 with her.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Season one has us waiting in anticipation for season two. Lucy Liu is the best. Could use more action. Great surprise ending.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Works well, has all the codecs under control. The only thing is a better help file as it is not always obvious how certain functions work.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Well Done by all the actors. No regrets in buying it.  It showed great scenery, street view living conditions, etc.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an entertaining show. They don't seem to push an agenda as some shows do. Of course, some of the writers &#34;opinions&#34; do show thru at times, but it is not a constantly 'in your face' kind of show. Laugh out loud funny at times!
B00BHMF578|2.0|This was the worst best movie I have ever watched.  Very cliche, over acted and the plot was oh so predictable. It did have some funny parts, which I am not sure they even intended. Ben, you do a lot of things poorly, but your acting is slightly less poor than you directing; so stick to bad acting and give up bad directing.  Thank you.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I've always know that the Borgia's were a ruthless family but this was really an eye opener.  I hope the producer<br />decides to put and end to it because as it is now it leaves everyone hanging.  I am waiting for a finale.
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham will never disappoint.  He deserves to be number one among all writers of this type of books. By far he is the greatest writer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it (; it's time consuming and addictive to play you will love it to I play it all the time
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Amazon usually delivers high quality product and outstanding service, however this time was an exception. After ordering the West Wing series, and getting my order in a timely manner, I was thrilled to open and watch!<br />When I opened the box, the DVD box itself fell apart! You could see where all the glue had lost all adhesiveness and wasn't sticking! I loved the box and it's appearance, but after this I was very unhappy and disappointed.<br />When I submitted a request to amazon for a poor product, my request was never answered.<br />So, after submitting a 3 star review, I've chosen to submit a 2 star review for no action taken on amazon's part.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game does challenge your brain. does get frustrating but its fun.:) :):) I am looking forward to new levels.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|This is sheer fantasy.  It has nothing to do with the Ian Fleming Legacy. His descriptions of some of the &#34;action&#34; sequences would do better in a comic book rather than an adult fiction story.  I stopped reading it way before the end. Very disapointing.
1932100660|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a reason to eat healthier.  The information in the book was easy to understand, clear and easy to follow.  I'm both amazed yet not surprised that I have not heard or read about these findings before now.  It was purely by accident that I was led to this book, it was referenced in another book I was reading.  I definately recommend it, everyone should know the information found in this book.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Works really well but would have prefered a much longer cor to plug in wall outlets.<br />Charges the Nexus 10 quite a bit faster than the OEM plug.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Fun during Shark week, I downloaded this as a FREE app of the day. IT was fun for the first few days but it grew repetitive fast. The kids like to play and my husband likes to play just to eat people but I don't see this as a long term app on my Kindle Fire.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Read the book years ago and have seen several movie productions of the story. The book is a great adventure.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Bad Piggies is fun but after a while I got bored. Maybe I'm just not in the mood to think that much or maybe my brain doesn't work in the way it needs to - to figure out how to place the piggie carts... Lots of luck to those of you who download & play this game and my hats off to those of you who fly through the levels with 3 stars!!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|We are giving to my brother-in-law as his birthday gift in September.  He doesn't have this one so we know he will love it.
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|This game (another free app of the day) is ok but it's hard for me to control and not enough instruction in the game play. If you forget to read the what to do before starting .... you're in trouble because I couldn't find instructions after I started the level. This isn't a game for me. I need fun not frustration! haha.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book was awesome. It really opens your eyes to the scariest things!!! Nikki Sixx you have huge balls to write this book and should be super proud of what you have accomplished!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Gotta have facebook right?? I use facebook to keep up with family and friends who don't live close enough to see on a regular basis and the fact that you can post pictures, videos, status updates ONCE and your entire family can see, share and comment is a plus!!
0307970299|2.0|I just felt the author was extremely too focused on her emotions and incessant self-absorption.  I also considered her on the sleazy side, but nontheless have a great amount of respect for her voluntary journey, something I wouldn't have the guts (or common sense?) to do.<br />I did like the fact that she expressed such sheer basic joy at eating a regular lunch or dinner after days of eating pre-packaged meals out of her backpack.  Definitely a lesson for us (incl me) spoiled Americans to appreciate what we have.<br />The section on the family horse's death was an extremely disturbing story of horrific animal abuse, and the author was responsible for the abuse.  just sickening.<br />I've read Bill Bryson's book on the Appalachian Trail, and found that to be more entertaining and educational.
B006LR0XLM|3.0|now that I have a pc to go with the tablet, i am sure it will be very usefull especially since taking and manuevering photographic material is the basis of my plans.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Highly recommend.  Covers all the emotions and you learn so much about World War II occupation and the island of Guernsey.  Witty and beautifully written.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i use it to find the new and relive the past, especially in music. any dislikes are the fault of youtube itself or the device I'm using.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|One of many great Jack Nicholson movies. It's an older movie, but it doesn't disappoint. It's refreshing to see a movie that isn't counting on special effects to make it worth seeing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a winner. I loved using my head to solve all the puzzles. I can't wait for more.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very interesting program.  Hated to see it end.  Well written and well acted.  English period programs are very interesting to me.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this  show from beginning to end absolutely every fairytale you can think of an  just when you think they forget someone bam they are there...my favorite show ever so excited  for season 3 in september also the spin-off once upon a time in wonderland!
0316044695|3.0|This book, or at least its second half, is a great survival story. It reminded me of the Geronimo biography by S. M. Barrett, or these seemingly-impossible stories about survival during WW2 (like Maus by Art Spiegelman).<br /><br />The first part of the book about navy SEAL training is a bit long but yet interesting. Some of the challenges aren't as difficult as the author tries to make them seem. After surviving hell week, which is supposed to be the hardest part of the training, a large number of recruits still failed the diving test. It seems ridiculous that someone who would want to become a Navy SEAL wouldn't know the basics of scuba diving.<br /><br />The second problem is that it is poorly written and morally dubious. The author keeps reminding you that it should be okay for the Military to shoot unarmed civilians, including teens. The authors blames the Geneva convention for the death of his team mates, when many other mistakes were done.<br /><br />I believe a number of people will read this and take it at face value. There's no doubt that this is an incredible survival story if you ignore the inconsistencies.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Love this game so not worth it too upgrade those other reviews are right don't even need to waste the money for a stupid upgrade just play the game r tards!<br />But yah overall I give it five stars best rts ever!!!!!
0062238868|5.0|Interesting war narrative that also contains other personal anecdotes by a Navy Seal. You can read through it quickly. I enjoyed the part in chapter 12 when there was a short episode with a foolish bar blowhard, whom he identifies only as Scruff Face.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love azada because its challenging.It's fun at the same time yet challenging and educational.I would recommend this to everyone.
B001NA6096|4.0|Even if you know the plot, these actors make it real and suggest a future but you have idea what it will be.
B009CG8DCA|5.0|I have studied the Tudor reign of English history, and while thre are some inaccuracies in the film, I still enjoy watching this film about once a week.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|After 9 years, the couple come together again and spend a few more hours together.<br />The bond between them is clear, even though the distance between them might still<br />be growing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale it's so fun and relaxing and easy. Buy this you won't be sorry!!!! It's so awesome and it's FREE. This game is so epic. But you have to sign into Facebook to see your friend's park.And it's fun to breed dragons and you can't stay poor for long in the game. Get My Singing Monsters too.It's awesome too!!!! BUY THIS ALL 1STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE!!!!!!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|After I watched this movie, I had to see it again, I laughed so hard the first time! It's a tender and fun story of a quadriplegic and his nurse, a petty delinquent in Paris. The friendship that grows between these two men is heart warming, told without the drama one would expect of a story of a seriously handicapped man. I warmly recommend Intouchables.
B000FA675C|5.0|Couldn't ask for a more riveting plot, the action was amazing and I loved all of the historical facts and angles brought into the story. Dan Brown's work didn't disappoint and I'm picking up Angels and Demons immediately.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really liked this book, it took me but a few hours to complete it. Still, I wouldnt say is Gaiman's best.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun to play but it takes awhile to build your city or whatever unless you pay for coins and stuff with real money which I suggest you don't!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|love it a lot play it a lot come back to it often, get it I like it and I try to beat my old score or just play to play. this puzzle game is fun you go around the cube and get rid of two of a kind until all is gone. it's timed but if you want to just play ignore the time and just play for fun. some times we just need to play games without the push of getting through it to beat something. if you like puzzles this is a great one
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie.  Only time that I have read the book and seen the movie and loved both.  A definite must see.
B0063M22QO|4.0|this game is fun and I come back and play it over and over it's not just a one time deal, I like a game I can come back to and play over and over this is one of those. if you like this type of game
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Another great album from Michael Buble.  We keep listening to it over and over.  The CD came quickly and in good condition.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very interested book. It took a few chapters to really get into the characters and the plot but it was very interesting after that. Lots of unexpected things & keeps you wanting more.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I recently got my bumper in the mail and fell in love with the feel the moment I slapped it on my phone. Its a very snug fit, so there are no worries of the phone slipping out of it during a fall (as was my concern with previous bumpers), and it adds a very premium feel to the phone while holding it. As I said, its very snug, so I wouldn't attempt to put the bumper on with screen protectors, back or front. A must buy for anyone. +1
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not so hard you want to give up, but not so simple you aren't enjoying it. The Room was fun and mildly challenging!
B001DJLCRC|2.0|Perhaps so.  And to be fair, I've only watched Season One -- and that because almost all of my friends assured me that I'd love it.  Well, I didn't.  I found the lead actor/character both dull and annoying.  Ditto his family.  Ditto his sidekick.  Because of the tremendous buzz around the series, and because friends have assured me that it gets better as it goes along (particularly that the outside villains get more interesting), I have not given up completely on Breaking Bad.  But I'll not be buying the next installments; if I ever get streaming NetFlix set up (which probably won't happen quickly), I'll no doubt give Season Two a whirl.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was my first puzzle game on kindle and now it is hard to find one that compares! It was truly challenging and the graphics are incredible!  I loved the level of detail and interaction.<br />I want more from this creator!
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|Soulful, cultured, fun. What more can I say? If you don't like celo music you have no soul. So there.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family of four loved this movie--and all of us laughed out loud on several occasions.  It was also tender with a touching story that made it even better.  Fun for everyone!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Gladwell shows how the most successful people got to the top. It shows how hard work and recognizing opportunity helped.  Some of those opportunities can be manufactured.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Fantastic show and hate that its over. Wish they had gone on with it.  Feel abandoned myself. LOL<br />What about a movie to wrap it up?
B001B6M0F0|5.0|This is probably the best rock concert album ever made.  This CD is the entire show start to finish (except the bonus tracks) without any fades or drops.  I love that it is a true live album and what a great set list at that!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book.  Along lines of Fifty but not as kinky.  Loved the perspective and the pace.  Glad I downloaded all three in series so far.
B000P7V45S|5.0|This is my favorite Genesis album of the Collins era.  It is even almost hard to believe that Peter Gabriel isn't singing on this record.
1401922732|5.0|Again another Doreen Virtue product that is worth every penny.  Well done! great artwork and cards are of good quality paper and sturdy enough to be used often.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I have had this since it was out on vinyl and have listened to these songs hundreds of times over the years.  I almost didn't buy it as I didn't want to shell out $25 for a CD I already have b ut I am so glad I did!  I have never heard Skynyrd like this.  This CD is flawless, I had chills listening to Freebird, it was like I never heard the song before. I could picture the band up on stage, and the audience.  I am so glad I decided to buy this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you havent read Hugh Howey's WOOL, then what are you waiting for? I read it entirely on vacation in Florida. It has been months (and many books later) and I am still reliving some of the scenes from this first in a series. This one is a must-read for anyone who enjoys the dystopian literature out there now-a-days. Flawless story, AND you can continue with SHIFT and then the last one is due out any day now entitled DUST...
B00006WKSZ|5.0|I have owned different versions of Tokyo Tapes since my early Vinyl and cassette. This is the Scorpions firing on all cylinders.  There is not a bad song on the CD.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was skeptical at first. I am not really into fantasy books, but it was recommended to me after reading Divergent and I was HOOKED. All I can say is read all the books....don't be discouraged when you get some &#34;news&#34; at the end of the first book. Totally worth the wait! I'm on book 4 now.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is my favorite Rainbow album by a mile.  I remember going to the concerts back in the day and falling in love with Dio's voice.  What a great era of rock and roll that we will never see again.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|I'm amazed at Bruce's ability to deliver great entertainment time after time. Fully enjoyable movie. I enjoyed mine on my Kindle HD.<br />So much fun to have HD at your fingertips to watch movies any time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think the tournaments should not allow powerups as some people have more money to buy them with. To make it more equal  it should be by skill alone.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for ways to change themselves.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I really wanted to see this film so I bought it and was not disappointed.  It arrived very quickly and was in great condition!
072325804X|4.0|Getting this book was a much better deal than purchasing all of the books separately.  I can't wait to experience the stories again!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Excelent app, high resolution good connectivity I like the resizing screen for mobiles devices is better than team viewer the unique problem is dont have free version, thanks
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|As a film student, I regard this movie as very well made, However the premise behind the power the bad guy finds is lacking, and the ending was a lil weak as it just set up for the other Avengers movie. Over all it was good and entertaining, it just felt rushed for the ending.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Mark you are the greats but with this album (TE LA COMISTE). I love it and I do love must of your son but this one you are going to win a lot of trophic. Dios te bendiga, y sigue dando lo major de ti.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have Intel WiDi box which was a PAIN to setup and still unsuccessful, then I had google revue box which was great except the wifi signal was weak.<br /><br />then I got this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easiest setup I've experienced<br />-Chromecast feature works FLAWLESSLY with youtube app. It is so much faster to get your results by just using your phone instead of revue (ie, grabbing the keyboard, load the app, apply search)<br />-Wifi Signal is STRONG!, this is hooked to my a/v receiver which is in a cabinet and where revue got weak signals, this has NO issues. very surprised<br /><br />CONS:<br />None. for $35 you CANNOT complain
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show! And everything about it! The bickering between the two main characters will always make you laugh. My husband and I both love it.
B00BESM14U|4.0|The story is a little mysterious....maybe I missed something but who was he writing to?  Was it just an therapy exercise diary?  I guess it was targeted at the youngsters-teens.....
B00EH49DXA|2.0|There is no question when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has definitely been known more for trying to be a pussycat in music, than trying to ignite with sex appeal in voice. She shown that shallowing down with her marriage Russell Brand ending late last year. But her trying to get back into music with her next album, doesn't seem like a far cry, it feels more like a waste to the ears with her lead single from the upcoming record Prism is definitely a waste upon the ears. Katy has definitely lost her talent in her voice, as she tries to make her own version of the Sara Bareilles song Brave. She sounds more like a whimper of herself than someone who can ignite, like she did to her fans with California Gurls. I think Katy should go back to square one with her voice, than ignite something new.<br /><br />Song: D-
B00CWY76CC|4.0|When the game started I wasn't sure what I was  doing...but as glues became<br />visible as I tapped away things started to come  together & the elevator doors<br />started to open. I really liked the challenge of not knowing where to look or<br /> what to look for since each room was so different. :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|such a fun game! the minions are soooo cute! but the tilting from side to side can be quite difficult. and the vector challenge is really hard to beat.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|he stomped a guys face till it looked like a bowl of oatmeal.  his head was the bowl and the brains were oatmeal.  nuff' said.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|It was OK.  Good graphics.  Story line  was odd.  Found it kind of boring....would not purchase again.  Better if it was free.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love New Girl. The show is so refreshing. It feels like real people with real problems that you can relate to! I downloaded the app for my iPad and the videos worked wonderfully, I've watched them all a few times.  :)
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite all time movies. I got it quickly and in good shape. Thanks.
0142418471|1.0|I did not choose this book out of personal desire, but more because it is an assigned reading for a class I am taking. As we all know, assigned reading is usually hit or miss, and for me, this was very much of a miss. I would not have completed reading it if my grade was not tied to the novel.  There are many things structurally about this book I did enjoy. First and foremost, the book itself tends to be consistent in the narrative, and I did enjoy the variation between one Will Grayson to the next. It is easy to read, and has it's moments of goodness. Overall, the story touches on many important aspects of personal relationships and is resonant of the changing times we live it. It is an idealized version of the way things could be if we tried, and that is an important message to preach.  On to the bad, where I will receive all my down votes...  None of the characters stood out to me. The concept of two characters sharing the same name had plenty of potential, but their interactions are limited. The book is about these two characters growing, but it could have easily been &#34;Neal and Bob&#34; or &#34;Dick and Tim&#34;. The Jane role is largely forgettable, and in the Tiny production her name is changed to Janey. I did not realize that the name was slightly altered for the play, and just considered it lazy writing on behalf of the authors. To me, Jane was easily the Plain Jane of the tale.  Next is the role of Tiny, a character about as one dimensional as they come. We do not get his full name, nor do we see the character outside of himself. He is flamboyantly gay, but there is much more to him that the authors neglected to show. Why does he live in a separate home? Why do we only see Will Grayson and Will Grayson interact with their parents, yet Tiny does not? Tiny is as essential to the progression of the story, and the only rounded thing about Tiny is his character description. Also, I really, really hated how they only called him by his nickname, always mentionhis size, and never once treat him like a normal person living in the real world.  We are introduced to a character named Gideon, who is also gay, but his late introduction and brief explanation render him a worthless character. A lot could have been done with the character, but instead we have a cut out with a few lines of dialogue.  Next, this book is extremely vulgar for a story aimed as young adult literature. I have taken many classes with serious literature, and none of them compare to being as explicit as this one. It is written for shock. I hope to believe it was written for authenticity in speech, but this seriously comes off as an outsider looking in to teen life and populating it with angst and other forms of social tribulation. I honestly hope the authors realize that a writer can summarize in their writing and not need to have every piece of dialogue written.  The subject matter did not interest me, but it did not offend me either. It is our responsibility as rational people to look beyond ourselves, but I believe the author(s) were trying a bit too hard to make what I consider the first homosexual fairy tale. In the end, I found myself actively hating Tiny, Jane, and both Will Grayson roles. The friend of Tiny was more likable, but not by much. The ending is about as cliche as one can think when writing a romance story, and in all, I found myself wanting to drop the book and spend my time living or watching what my pet was doing (it was ball licking, if you were wondering).  It is an insightful story, but it could have been handled so much better, and to me, that is the most unforgivable part of the book. Rent, or borrow, and only buy if you love teenage depression and rage with dull dialogue, unnecessary swearing, and paper dolls for protagonists.  Now you may down vote.
B004GYY714|5.0|This radio works and let's you go to most radios in the word. You can listen to music news sports and talk stations. This radio app is the app I downloaded on my Kindle Fire HD!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I loved the film from the opening to the last credits.  Finally a horror movie that takes me back to why I love horror movies in the first place.  Great story, great acting, and the music and sound were perfect.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|I love Cougar Town. It is one of my favorite shows and I watch a lot of shows. The beginning of this season is very different than the rest of the show. If you have never seen this show before, power through the first few episodes (I still thought they were decent) and wait for the show to settle on the Cul-de-sac crew, you will be so happy you did!
B000NJXG6S|4.0|It was cheaper than buying the official complete series package, but still has everything I wanted. I am very happy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am a frequent reader and I hate when books are predictable. I did not see the ending of this book coming or the middle, even. Keeps you guessing. A must read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I like facts vs myths this book shows this and I like nonfiction vs fiction again that is what this book is informative good read evan for hard belivers
B004GYY714|5.0|I love having the opportunity to select and listen<br />to stations that play the music i like. Thank you<br />very much.
B009LGO88E|4.0|I wish the R button work on all games so I didn't have to reach pass it for the R button on the actual system but that's more of Nintendo fault for not updating the firmware to support that.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|this show wants me to do some research of that era and see how much it follows the series. Great show!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|ok
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I am not sure if it was because I watched it late at night, or if the movie was just disturbing in general.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|There are only 2 songs I dislike. The movie is awesome and so is the sound track! Great buy! Thanks!

B000FC1RCI|5.0|This is my personal favourite  Agatha Christie book. It has a masterpiece plot that keeps you wondering:Who is the murderer. I love the way it was written by the characters in third person. I love the way it has a rhyme called Ten Little Soldiers. All the characters are pitch perfect. The rhyme is about how ten soldiers die in 10 parts and then there were none. The plot is about how 10 people are sent to Soldier Island  ,offered jobs at Soldier Island asked by U.N.Owen or UNKNOWN. Eventually it is discovered that U.N.Owen is one of themselves. Who is the murderer? Find out in And Then There Were None.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It was really cool!! There were lots of fun things to do with it!! I liked the editing!! And all the cool stickers!!

B0094OLJD0|3.0|Now hear me when I say this, Annie Clark is one of my favorite songwriters around. I think she's one of the most beautiful and talented women alive today, but this record doesn't do it for me, I don't understand all the high ratings it's receiving, it's a three-star album at best. Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Annie's since before Actor came out. I've seen her live twice and both performances rank as my top favorite shows of all time, but I'm compelled to write an honest review of this record.<br />The great thing about Annie's music is her use of catchy hooks. For example \\"Chloe in the Afternoon,\\" \\"Marry Me,\\" Cruel... the list goes on and on. This album is almost entirely devoid of good hooks. As a musician I can appreciate the beautifully written string sections on the record, but if a good melody doesn't back it, what's the point? Another thing to note is that Annie doesn't really sound like herself on this album. On her prior three albums she uses a lot of head voice and falsetto, but this album is sung mostly in chest voice. The beautiful vocal timbre that we are used to hearing on a St. Vincent record, isn't there. And another noteworthy thing, is the lack of guitar work. One of the things that make Annie's music so unique is her guitar playing, but there's significantly less of it on this record.<br /><br />With all that said, I understand, its not JUST a St. Vincent record, so naturally it shouldn't sound the same, but I still feel that it could have been way better.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|I think the author definitely has skill - there is no doubt that he can write well.  And I really enjoyed the interesting method he chose to tell the story, but my admiration ends there.  As a teacher of high school students, I regularly witness the cruelty that students suffer at the hands of another and while it is not to be trivialized, I think the author exaggerates the effect it can have on some teenagers.  The young woman who commits suicide does have some truly valid reasons to be despondent, and yet some of her other reasons are really just temporary hurtful things, that in time would diminish.  Even the most sensitive teenager with a bit of common sense would recognize this.  Being voted Best Ass in school is hardly a reason to throw one's life away, nor is being stood up on a date a valid excuse to commit suicide.  Although I would bet every single reader has felt some similar humiliation suffered by this young woman, it is still so difficult to identify with her.  She is completely unlikable.  Asher creates a portrait of a selfish, self-absorbed, mean-spirited, petty, and vengeful young woman who goes to great lengths to punish people whom she thinks have wronged her. I have a friend who committed suicide and it is the most devastating, awful thing that can happen to that person, his/her family and friends.  It seems to me that the author could not have known anyone who has committed suicide, otherwise he would not have made light of it by choosing the ridiculous reasons that this girl did for taking her own life.  What is the message here?  I can only guess that it is not to bully others, but there must have been a better vehicle for getting that message across than the this book.  One can only hope that teenagers who read this will not be seduced into thinking that suicide is a great way to get revenge on others, or to propel themselves into post mortem popularity.
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|Now this is way different then her other cds. But I like it. Looking forward to more music in the future from her.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Fast moving story that unfolded as the author walked the PCT giving the reader a sense of who she was and the demons she was ridding from herself while discovering a meaning to her being.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Suspense as always. Good read. Keeps you on edge as all his books do. I recommend this book to all Dan Brown fans.

B000LN7HUC|5.0|Easy to obtain fuel from many sources. Setup is small andjust right for a single camper. Nice and quiet, without parts which can wear out or be troublesome.
B005UD1D62|4.0|A quick read, you know what you're getting.  Total guilty pleasure. I may or may not have purchased the second one because I missed it when it was over!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another brilliant Hosseini novel! Vivid, alive characters intertwine with one another in a plot that twists and turns in and out of their<br /> lives. It holds your interest right to the end.<br /><br />.
B00092ZL80|5.0|My favorite concert by far ... Love both bands and my kids enjoy the music as well. Great purchase for music lovers
B009CF3MEK|5.0|This a great classic movie.<br />I enjoyed watching it once again.<br />I had forgotten how handsome Robert Redford and how beautiful Mia Farrow were in their youth.
B0087X728K|5.0|I've been using this for over a month now and I have had no issues.  It works just as advertised.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I didn't even finish watching the movie because it was so boring and filled with ignorance. I thought it was going to be funny, but it was not. I love Charlize Theron but this was terrible.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|awesome cd great sound killer set list 2 cd's over 2 hours of music well worth the price highly recomended
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend. It is a lovely funny story but with a real message behind it. A delightful read
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Great music, amazing voice and will check out more by this artist. Like all the tracks except one, Blue Velvet.
098478280X|5.0|You must have it if you are looking for a position as a programmer. I has many examples for the common question you will face in the interview.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I almost never write reviews, but this was such a great read that I felt it a must!  Written in an amazingly funny and witty way, great strong characters and sexy hot scenes... Who could ask for more!?!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the book and was sorry to see it end.  The character development was well done and I appreciate that the book was well written (correct grammar and spelling).  The story was engrossing from start to finish.  If you enjoy reading historical fiction, I highly recommend this one.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|My Kindle Fire is always right there for my reading pleasure, my challenging WwF or whatever strikes my fancy at the moment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. Have gotten hubby hooked on it as well. Streaming it from Amazon was easy, fast and awesome. I am so glad we have a Prime Membership
B0015DWJX2|5.0|While I have always known of the Guernsey isles, the part they played in the War was a revelation to me.  I have recommended this book to my Book Club.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The best comic to action movie made yet! Hollywood, Joss Wheddon, got it right! If you don't enjoy this movie, I don't know what you'd like.
B000HGA5PM|1.0|The picture quality was awful. The sound quality was poor. I can't find any use for this DVD other than to lay around and gather dust. I love Pink Floyd and I was hoping to get some decent footage of one of their old concerts but this does nothing for my wish. I would not have bought this if I knew what it was.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only thing I didn't like on this app was how long it took to download. It took me a couple times before it stuck. It could have been my internet connection but everything else is great on it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love it!  If you're a fan of Les Mis the musical, you'll love this as well.  I do wish it weren't just the highlights, as many of the musical's best songs are missing, but I can't knock a star off, as it was disclosed beforehand that it was just highlights.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Excellent writing and acting! One of the best shows. Really smart story lines and interesting characters.TGW is a wonderful escape from the doldrums.
0345803485|5.0|It is a great book to give your wife to get her to try new things and just hot n horny, so do your self a favor  and gift it today!!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Not as great as Lord of the Ring. it has a very calm feel threw out the movie. It doesn't feel like they have a huge priority in the quest.I know its a prequel, while the graphics and story telling is very similar to Lord of the Rings its missing the priority element the others had.
B004SIP6LS|4.0|I TRIED THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY AND TO MY SURPRISE, I ENJOYED THIS CRAZY GROUP OF MISFITS.<br />THIS BAND OF WHAT I CALL SCHOOL DROP OUTS HAVE A UNIQUE VIEW ON LIFE.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because the animation of &#34;mama&#34; at the end looks a bit cartoonish. They could have done a better design, transformation did look good but when you physically see her (face eyes mouth) she looks to highly animated.Beyond that, the film story, direction was excellent luckily you never saw her face till towards the end.. which in my opinion made the movie better. the weak part was her animation. You wont really notice it till the end and it also does not ruin the film.
B00029NMRM|4.0|BEING THAT THIS IS A SEQUAL FROM THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, THIS MOVIE NOT ONLY MADE THE WHOLE TEN YARDS, BUT IT RAN A TOUCHDOWN FOR ME. THEY GENERATED ENOUGH INTEREST TO KEEP YOU GOING AND ADDED ENOUGH HUMOR TO MAKE YOU WATCH IT AGAIN.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to all my friends. It drew me in and kept me fascinated.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|If you are a woman and in the work force you must read it. It tells you all the things you already knew and more. Its incredible!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!! can't wait for season 4, it has been so fun to watch on iPad, great time filler in my busy days.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Matt Damon was awesome as Jason Bourne. Great action scenes that were non-stop throughout the movie. Bourne 2 was great too, but #3 with a different Bourne was a big disappointment.
B003WKOTXE|4.0|Gain a little perspective on four separate cultures and how they raise newborns. Thought provoking and a wake up call for Americans... do we really need all the crap in that playpen? Di we need the playpen?
B009XPGJYY|5.0|If you have read lots of biker books, you may be able to tell the end of this story, but I haven't and so the story remains full of suspicion.  The plot keeps thickening and gets deeper under your skin.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Won't work on my Nextbook 7 even though it is identical to my sister's (app works on it).<br />Keeps loading Amazon App Store.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Cute little game good for killing time ... has great graphic and fun interaction with characters and fun story line... have loved Nemo from the start as well as my kids
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|For some reason the alarm went off but no sound came out. I don't know if it is operator error or settings on kindle or what...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been watching The Walking Dead since season 1!!  I love all of them. I keep watching them over and over.  It is cool to see how the people are coping with what has happened.  How Rick has changed since it first started, and it is so realistic.  Dont have enough words. It keeps getting better!!
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|The first 2 Led Zeppelin LPs were, in my opinion, when they were in top form. Blues tinged songs with the masterful playing of Page. Soaring vocals from a young Plant. Like I said, does it get any better than this?
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is the coolest case.  It shuts the Kindle down when you close it and starts it up when you open it...what could be smarter?!?!
B0046OOUIE|5.0|Depending on your taste in Clapton music (blues or the pop stuff) you may or may not like this CD. It has taken him nearly a lifetime to attempt the music of his hero, Robert Johnson, and he has mastered it. If you are a guitarist of any type, buy this CD and get the song book that has the tab for all the songs. It's like the best lesson in blues guitar that you can get.<br />This is a must have CD for Clapton and blues fans alike!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very sweet movie with some funny lines that the adults will &#34;get.&#34;  The girls (especially Agnes) are cute and funny!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Author needed to use the thesaurus less. She constantly repeats the same words, but seemingly words people just don't use anymore this day in age.. The love story is nice, the sexual encounters became almost monotonous. I'll finish the trilogy though.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this story it grabs you from the very start. Deborah Harkness uses her descriptions to draw you in to the story.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Absolutely amazing book, and couldn't put it down. It reads like a story anyone in IT could tell and it was amazingly gripping while being light at the same time. You won't find much technical stuff here but the process and procedure information as well as the intro to &#34;The Three Ways&#34; is beyond valuable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has large numbers , easy to use. It is helping me a lot make sure my numbers are in order. I think this is the best one out there so far.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I bought this movie purely to test the 3D capabilities of my two different types of 3D TV sets.  It did not disappoint.  One TV is 3D ready DLP Link active shutter and the other is passive 3D.  I expected results to be better with active shutter but was surprised that the passive 3D yielded at least as good a picture without the angle and distance limitations of DLP Link.  Not sure whether the problems with DLP Link are with the TV or the glasses.  The movie is much more immersive when viewed in 3D.  It's at least as good as it was in IMAX 3D.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I am happy that percy is back in action in this book.  The new storyline is wonderful to read through.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The modified pics don't actually save. I figured I'd give it a try since it's free today, but what a waste. Looks like a well designed &amp; easy to use app, but is completely useless workout the ability to save. I used a file utility app to see if I could find it elsewhere, &amp; again, no go.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Gaga is back! This song is quintessential pop. Its infectiousness is reminiscent of The Fame era, but with Gaga's more developed vocals and a musical upgrade from the overly produced Born This Way. Between this song and Burqa, ARTPOP is looking to be huge.<br /><br />And way to go Amazon for getting this up so fast.
B008220AVW|1.0|the only real katy we see is when shes dumped.she cant even communicate w/her family cuz shes fake.shes a woman act like one.great deal now I know why.little beiber was more interesting than this.anythunig to make A BUCK I GUESS.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really liked the book.  I wondered how he was going to tie all of the characters together but he managed to do it at the end.<br />Such a sad country--will they ever live in a time of peace?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game just wish u didnt need so many of the gru coins to get things and with the menu where it shows ur friends, its not always clear what ur doing when u click on something but overall great game
B00AYHKOZU|4.0|Very nice album, remember que another albums when chameleon was a greatest idol of 70s. The musicians who joined at ship:Tony Levin(bass) and  once again, Tony Visconti.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love this game....can make new friends. The only big negative is the ads that are 30 seconds long and it is hard to get credits to play.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|I thought the acting was superb but the movie is disturbing in nature. It made me think for a while after watching it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Cant save the file, tried a custom location and it appears to save but does not. Already uninstalled, glad I didnt pay for it.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|Love Gravity, Between the Lines, and City!  Amazing vocals!!  Bought the new album and had to buy the old album!

B008PUQUJW|5.0|Ok.  What can I say?  I love a musical.  The music was great!  I love the song &#34;Motor Mouth Mable&#34; sings.  Who wants a twig when you can have the whole tree?  PRICELESS!
1452126577|5.0|This is the grumpiest, most horrid book I have ever had the misfortune to own!  Every page is full of scowls, insults, games and puzzles, some with no solutions (for serious!), and more that is certain to put you in a foul mood.  Grumpy Cat did a spectacularly awful job showing her repulsive fans how to be just as grumpy as she is.  It worked for me!  Get this book, and you can be a big grump, too! >:(
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A wonderful movie brings us back to what is most important God, and family.  Sent it to children for their families to enjoy.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|There is nothing I can criticize about this show...everything is terrific. Usually, I'm well aware of even minor flaws, but everything from the casting to the directing, the acting to the cinematography, is all beautifully done. The story holds the viewer from the first minute. In a peaceful little town in Britain, where it appears that nothing much ever happens and everyone knows everyone else, a young boy is murdered. Immediately, like a stone thrown into a pond, the ripples spread out to engulf each person and each sector of the community. The actors have that wonderful British look: crooked teeth, wrinkles, a refreshing lack of plastic surgery and Botox, so that they look like real people and you can tell them apart. No lineup of Barbie dolls and stud muffins here! The location is just charming enough to emphasize the horror of what has occurred, and just seedy enough to emphasize that there's more to this than meets the eye. To top it off, a local newspaperman finds himself in hot water as, struggling to get assigned to a major paper, he jumps the gun with the media and a bigger player comes to town. The main protagonists - though they don't steal the scenes but blend in harmoniously - are the new lead investigator, fresh from a scandalous situation in the big city, and the local woman who expected to get his job. Since most folks are friends or relatives (the reporter is the nephew of the female investigator), it seems hard to keep a secret, yet secrets abound. The first episode, without appearing rushed or confusing, manages to bring in a host of suspicious people and events and attitudes. One of the best things about the series is that it is a closed one, i.e. you know in advance that the whole story will be wound up in 8 episodes. That keeps it tight and prevents unnecessary filler, such as the kind found in series which are open-ended. I happen to know the whole story arc, but the acting will keep me glued to the screen for the next 7 episodes. The serieshas not only been renewed (presumably with a different case to be solved) but American tv is developing a version of it. This is a gem!
B007GE2H3G|3.0|the story line was rather expected.  there was no spectacular scenes.  Esp considering it's made by two amazing people, Peter Jackson and Stephen Spielberg.  Frankly, I am glad I didn't go to a theater to see it.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|We loved this and all the SG1 episodes. I am totally hooked on the series. We see something new each time we watch.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Such a great app.. the pictures are amazing on my kindle fire HD... my kids also love it on there kindle as well
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Please fix the problem with saving and also give the option to share pictures from other apps to this app. Going to be using Photo Editor by Macgyver for now
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Wont go into details but I absolutely loved the film. I love a good sci-fi movie with some unexpected twist to it. This one fit the bill.
0142421715|5.0|Enjoying it- still haven't been able to finish it but this trilogy is a lot like Then Hunger Games-they should make a movie about this one :)
B002P3J3BW|5.0|Vladimir Horowitz continues to be the most closely studied pianist even though he died in 1989.  His entire discography is available today, and this set covers pretty much everything that was commercially released with the exception of the DG recordings.  Hank Drake has done an exquisite job reviewing the set in detail, and I will not try to compete with his work.  There is no need anyway, because the best point to be made is that any pianist, even those who hate Horowitz, would do well to study these recordings, made by a pianist who &#34;played a principal role in the history of the instrument&#34;, to quote David Dubal.  Music lovers in general should listen to these recordings, because the colors Horowitz draws from the instrument are beyond compare.  Do not make money an issue in buying this set.  It is worth the price and more.
B005F2SVFY|5.0|Image quality is not as good as touchscreen on my ePM2, but it's good enough for composing shots which is what it's for.  It's perfect for outdoors in sunlight and being able to tilt it makes getting low angle shots easier.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Takes me back to the likes of Red October, but with a 21st century cyber twist.  An excellent read that you'll steal the hours away.
B0009UC81A|5.0|Received on time. One of our favorite movies of all time .  Great family movie with good music . Love the old movies . John and Dan are great as well as the others in this movie
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i hate to let junk build up on my computers or my kindle.now i finally have a way to dejunk it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It's a shame that there is a controversy about this book that has nothing to do with the actual content of the book, Aslan makes a very interesting narrative for the life of Jesus the man, and his use of sources is top notch. Even if one doesn't agree with the narrative Aslan puts forward, this book would be an excellent read for someone just looking to understand the time period and politics of when Jesus of Nazareth was still walking around.
B005544V6A|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW! Well worth being able to see the entire season and makes you want to see more
B00004VWA7|4.0|Wish he was still around.  Not as well known of an album, probably the Weather Report stuff people remember more, but there are some great cuts on here that are pure Jaco.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I know this movie word for word. It's great!!! This is a classic in my book.  Patrick Swayze at his finest.
B00002DEBW|4.0|This is a great CD.  The music is soothing melodies at times, and fusion driven orchestrations at others. Not for everyone, but shows what this ensemble was (is) capable of.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Love this book read it on the beach in Aruba, could not but it down Lee Child has done it again
0761169253|5.0|Recommended over and over by respected art workshop presenters, I finally caved and got a copy. Small book with big ideas, not just for artists but for anyone looking at ways to improve their performance, including athletes.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Wonderfully tragic short story that is timeless. This is truly a study of the depression, mental health, and the dreams of America.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Easy matching game that gets harder the more you advance. Fighting dragons and knights along the way to 1 million points.
1455502758|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR.  WHAT A LOSS.  I RELIED ON HIM FOR SENSIBLE THOUGHTS ABOUT ANYTHING AND EVERY THING.  NOW,  THAT HE IS GONE,  I ASK MYSELF,  WHAT WOULD CHRISTOPHER HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS?  THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS.  I LOVE THAT HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO WRITE UNTIL THE BITTER END.  HIS FINAL BOOK, ALAS.  JOY WOOD

B00000DFSK|5.0|How can I not give U2 a five star review? If you're looking to get into U2 PLEASE buy their full albums first. If you're already a fan and want a good compilation of early works this is golden.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Game is a lot of fun and definitely worth the download. The only negative is it takes to long to complete some of the objectives.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Asked Me To Choose A Picture And Nothing Happened. Id Rather Watch M.A.S.H then Use This App.  Im Sure Others Would Agree.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game to share with the whole family.  We take turns to see who can get the most bananas.  In this electronic time, family game night is still possible.

B005LLSZNM|3.0|I guess the writers have some timeline of events to cover and this is how they do it, but characters are just doing things they wouldn't really do and some really improbable things happen that are just too far-fetched to swallow. I don't plan to put time into Season 5.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game for everyone. Love it. Wish i could fine more coins! Cant wait t rex is ready. I strongly recommen this game
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Wow! I have been reunited with my most favorite college music!  What more can I say, the Beatles are incredible music!

B008XG1X18|4.0|Just as easy as accessing it via the computer.  Great ideas for all sorts of crafts, food recipes and events.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What to say about this. One of the great electronic device, that I purchased in recent times. Very easy to use and loving it. People say that, why do you buy a new product, just use your laptop throught hdmi. Just use this once, you will change your statement.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is among the best fictional detectives ever created. I was &#34;on the job&#34; for more than forty years I can say from experience that Bosch is truly a believe able character. He &#34;represents&#34; for so many really good detectives who<br />find it necessary to bend and stretch established guidelines to achive a morally correct outcome.
0783229372|5.0|I love history and this movie is history, I would buy it again if I didn't already have this movie, it is suspensful and keeps you on the edge of your seat...I will show this movie to my grandchildren....thank you Beverly Patton
125000098X|5.0|I could hardly wait to get this book as I'd read the first two in the series and was hooked.  I checked here and bought a like new condition book for about 1/3 the bookstore new price and the copy I got was excellent and the service was great.  The book was wonderful too, left you wide open for another sequel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm speechless after reading this.<br />It's a beautiful and great story that everyone should read.<br />I'm excited to read the rest of his books.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Go get it. it takes a little time to learn the finer points of all it can do, but it's great.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|No need to comment - just say David Coverdale! God bless guys like him, Ian Gillan, Glen Hughes, Don Airey, Ozzy, Mick Box, etc.
159102594X|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I considered giving it just four stars, but only because the series just gets better as it goes along, and the last two books [[ASIN:1591026415 Before They Are Hanged]] and [[ASIN:1591026903 Last Argument of Kings]]) are truly superb. Still, it seemed unfair to punish this book for the success of its sequels, so I settled on five stars.<br /><br />The characters are vibrant and personable with surprising layers of complexity. Just when you think you have a firm grasp of who each character is, Abercrombie keeps surprising you. Likeable characters are capable of shocking violence and cruelty and unlikeable characters often are put in situations that evoke the reader's sympathy. And by the end of the series, it's tough to decide who are the heroes and who are the villains.<br /><br />In spite of this moral complexity, the story itself is extremely fast-paced and almost light-hearted. Events move swiftly and the plot never seems to drag or become tedious. There are no maps or lineages provided for the reader to reference, but the geography is written clearly enough that the reader isn't left confused about where events are transpiring, even when characters are divided by great distances (as they are in the entire second book).<br /><br />It is truly outstanding how Abercrombie has managed to fill the story with so much moral complexity and so many politician machinations, all while weaving a coherent historic and mystic backstory for this world, and still keep the plot moving so briskly along. I'm off to ready [[ASIN:0316198358 Best Served Cold]] now.
1401324649|5.0|Chapters alternate between current day and Allen's long and interesting life over the past 100 years.<br />Hard to say which are more fun. Apolitical Allen is an explosive expert and has saved Generalissimo Franco's life and subsequently had dinner with him and also had dinner with Vice President Truman on April 12, 1945 (the day that Roosevelt died).<br />I had so much fun reading the book that now I want to get the audio version, so I can hear it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was all that & more!!! I will definitely be looking for more books by E.L. James. Kudos to E.L. Great book!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The show was interesting, although a little too violent. The characters were interesting and complex and the acting was amazing.
B00AO686G0|5.0|This DVD arrived much faster than I had anticipated. In addition to this being one of the greatest films, the extra features in this collectors edition are the icing on the cake.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This app is so much fun! Didn't even know I liked UNO this much. :) The matches are a lot of fun.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The game app may have been free, but you could only play the game once, then they want money and you can't just get to the bubble witch sage game again.  All I wanted was to play that game, but I deleted the app.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I like this app and I found this app though [...] and this app has many features which are very useful and great help. I recommend this app
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I liked the one episode I viewed.  However, I did have a little problem hearing what the characters were saying.  I had to play some of the parts more than once to understand what was said.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I like this as it is stand alone and does not require WiFi to access .This is the first app that I am tempted to buy the full edition.I highly recommend it.
B00AQ2G7D6|3.0|Seems like Steve was forced to do this movie... He halfheartedly goes through the motions of acting in this one.
B00DBSZT7C|1.0|I liked the grumbling witches but really, the modern day bad language and style of speech was just totally distracting. One must suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy a fantasy and that was impossible in this film.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book was a page turner because every time I thought the plot was falling in to place there would be a new twist.  It is a very fun read.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Not my favorite type of book.  Lost interest in the story as it seemed a little too confusing.  Surprised at how highly it is rated and reviewed as a good book for young readers.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|Another painful reminder of the inhumanity of the Holocaust.  It is still difficult to believe that human beings were capable of carrying out such monstrous acts.
B004X75RK4|5.0|So cute...slightly predictable but a great date movie or for girls night in. :) Sandra Bullock is a strong businesswoman with a hidden heart.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Love the concepts, easy to read and relevant to every aspect of my job as the ED of a historic theater in Arizona.  An essential read, from my perspective...<br /><br />C. Sumberg
0385340990|5.0|Similar to 84 Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff. The descriptions of day-to-day wartime deprivation on the island were fascinating. The German penchant for record keeping is legendary but who knew it also extended to the farm animals. The islanders' methods of getting around the pig count was most creative. The islanders used books as one of their wartime coping mechanisms.<br />The book inspired me to learn about the Guernsey Islands. I loved this book and was sorry to see it end.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|you'll think it's addictive.  good fun for all ages.  some games can make you feel frustrated and stressed.  not this one.<br /><br />6@_
0307279189|3.0|This is an entertaining story about running written in the jock style of men's magazines. Descriptions of the desert and Tarahumara are interesting. If you're in to in running it's a quick read with way too much product endorsement of Vibram shoes.
B00DU74U74|5.0|It had been a while since I read the book, so I couldn't really remember what all happened. Normally I always think the book is way better and the movie disappoints me, so it may have helped that its been a while. Loved the movie.
1594200823|4.0|The author presents a lot of research on industrial agriculture. It's not a fun read although Michael Pollan is very entertaining. Descriptions of the industrial organic food industry were eye opening. His experience on Salatin's farm was interesting and sent me off to research Salatin and his mobile chicken coop. The chapter on the boar hunt wasn't pretty and I wish he'd skipped it. I think he could have explored vegetarianism as an alternative further. Overall, great research presented well.
B0010T0QNQ|2.0|I have many crocs and have enjoyed them for the most part.  these are hard and tight in the upper foot area. VERY uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time ;(
0393316041|2.0|Feynman was a brilliant scientist and an arrogant, sexist jerk who entertained himself by humiliating others. The book is poorly written with limited vocabulary and repetitious sentence structure.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|You will never see a better group of main actors--no wonder 4 were nominated for Oscars. It is somewhat different--and much better--than the book. Jennifer Lawrence is a remarkable talent and I had no idea Bradley Cooper was such a good actor.  This film has real insight into mental illness and is a very powerful romance, while being very funny, too.  Yes, it is rather predictable and Rocky-esque, but I have not met anyone who did not like it a lot--often much more than they expected to (especially husbands whose wives made them see it).
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I was kind of skeptical about this show but once I started watching, I could not stop !!  I was addicted !  Kind of sad now that I tore through all the seasons !!!
B0000AUHPB|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing this movie at the cinema and now I have it at home. The acting is fantastic and the ending is great.
B008602KQI|2.0|Very little imagination and even less original story telling hide behind this big marketing budget of yet another tale of teenagers growing up.  It would be a disservice to the genre to call it sci-fi.  If you're looking for yet another spin on the substance of Twilight, this might be of interest, otherwise you'd be better off using your time watching a rerun of Blade Runner or Army Of Darkness.
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm not a big fan of action-oriented shows. Those tend to have lots of noise, machines, and action heroes without much depth. So, Falling Skies has lots to offer. In some ways, it has more in common with war dramas-- there's thought in what happens to family, ethics, society in crisis situations. (Quite a crisis...).  Nice to have good, veteran actors playing compelling characters, especially Noah Wyler and Will Patton.
B00AG472DS|5.0|the Zodiac' is a great movie and it completely tells the truth of how it was really told of all the original events
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Fantastic game but make sure you have time, can't put it down. This game is great for all ages. Awsome!
B00AEBB9FU|5.0|All the plots and subplots combine to make this Black Comedy the definitive movie of the Great Ression.  Total obsession with loyalty programs, &#34;making Limbo tolerable&#34; and still not so tolerable for some of the newly unemployed.  Substitution of pictures of distant places in place of a real honeymoon.<br /><br />The backfiring of the technology on it's planners, then its use on them and by them on each other is the ultimate irony.  Ending gives hope for human relationships to make a come back.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|You'll remember happy times, and smile and laugh.  You'll think about your past and you'll cry.  The Piano Guys will provide beautiful, emotional music as you contemplate your life.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is fun to play i would tell everyone i know to play it i love it<br />I would buy this game and other games like it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors writing about this time period. She is insightful, gives her twist on what might have happened. Can't wait for the next one!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|We were entertained. What we most enjoyed was that the movie was not a replay of the same theme that you've seen in  twenty other movies. The theme was unique in it's concept. The character and commitment display by the two young boys is a good life lesson to today's youth.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Great character development and wonderful story movement that makes you have to watch the next episode Kurt sutter one of the best writers ever
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Oh yes, I love the downloadable e-books to send to my kindle for Android.<br /><br />  Thank you very much,<br />  tina torres
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I loved this book for the insight it gave me on Nigeria, the Nigerian people, and the challenges undertaken by a Nigerian person coming to the US.  Very interesting and well written.
B0016492BW|5.0|Required viewing for the entire male gender and selected females. You know, the ones who have a broad sense of humor. BTW, just collect and watch all Terry Gilliam directed movies. ASAP.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I cried,  laughed and rooted for the characters.  What I liked about it was that it was real.  I could have put myself in her shoes easy.  I would HIGHLY recomend reading this!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I feel both entertained and &#34;grown-up&#34; when I watch this show.  It's good to have a show with so many strong female characters.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Storytelling is quite good along with the imagery used to create such a vivid environment. I'd recommend this to teens and adults as it has a very good story line!
0425263924|5.0|This one is the best one out of the 3 published.  I cannot wait for the 4th because at the end it gets really good.  You must read the first 2 and then this one.  Highly recommend all three, especially if your a fan of 50 shades ;)
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I re-read this book every few years, whenever I get the feeling I'd like to roam the countryside. The story is great, but the internal rabbit mythology as told by the rabbits to each other, takes this book to a real literary level, in a fun and heartwarming way. I just love it!
0425263916|5.0|This second book in the Crossfire series was better than the first. Although I liked the first, I felt like it was trying to mimic 50shades and thats a hard one to beat. This one is where it gets good, and if you were like me and had to wait 6 months before the 3rd one came out, it kinda left me hanging and definitely wanting more. I gave it 5 stars because it was with this one I thought the story was more detailed and far more interesting.  Definitely a must read after the first!!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|Not as good as the other comic book movies, but it can only get better with an actor like Chris Evans!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good book. It was an interesting view from one man's experience.  I am more of a suspense reader but this was a nice change of pace and as a Christian, I enjoyed it from a religious point of view.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game. Great to pass time and who wouldn't want diamonds. Although very addictive. I can't wait to to play some more. The only downside is the slight lag, but if you don't mind the lag it's great a t.
0670026638|4.0|This story is so...Japanese. I say that as a fan of Japanese literature and culture (who lived in Tokyo for a few years). Readers who have a similar interest in such things will know what I mean. That the plot touches on subjects that I find fascinating (Buddhism, crows, the 2011 tsunami, suicide, WWII, quantum mechanics and, of course, cats) only adds to its allure. The style of the storytelling reminds me most of Haruki Murakami's odd, quirky format for fiction (though this is much less quirky, if you can believe it). The part of the story involving Nao's life as a bullied school girl as well as her experiences related to her relationship with Babette made me uncomfortable, though, interestingly, I'd recently had a discussion with a Japanese friend about bullying, the school year schedule and the importance of entrance exams in Japanese students' lives (much different than in the US). Seems like a strange coincidence.<br /><br />The story is about a Japanese-Canadian woman who lives on Vancouver Island who finds a lunch box containing the diary of a 16-year-old Japanese girl, debris from the 2011 tsunami. Nao, the girl, says that she is writing to tell the story of her centarian Buddhist nun grandmother; however, the diary contains a lot of information about her own life, which, disturbingly, appears to be near its end, and that of her immediate family. Ruth, the woman who finds the diary, tries to unravel the mystery of the content of the lunch box (which contains more than just the diary). The reason behind the girl's father's state of mind when he returns to Japan, bullying she endures at the hands of her classmates, her relationship with her grandmother (especially related to finding her supa powa) and the bit about her uncle were especially memorable.<br /><br />As with Murakami, best of the book are the surprises, strange happenings, and dreams that seem to affect reality. As a fan of Japan, the feelings of nostalgia that reading this story brought out about my life there was a bonus, and reminded me that there are several books by Japanese authors that I want to reread. I also liked the complicated plotting, though I found that I had to concentrate more than I usually do to keep track of everything that was going on. Worst of the book: the extreme unlikelihood of this particular woman finding this particular diary and the extreme effort she goes through to figure things out (getting completely wrapped up in Nao's life from afar). Then again, it doesn't seem fair to criticize the complicated, unlikely relationship between the original owner and eventual finder of the Hello Kitty lunch box when I liked so much about the rest of the plot. In summary, A Tale for the Time Being is a complicated, well-plotted story with a distinct Japanese (duh) feel. Also good: The Old Capital by Yasunari Kawabata, The Wind Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami and The Girl I Left Behind by Shusaku Endo.my life there was a bonus, and reminded me that there are several books by Japanese authors that I want to reread.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book but totally disliked the ending.  I felt there should have been more closure.  What happened to them?
B0008ENHTE|5.0|best film chase scene close to the French Connection's-- broody-- a little drawn out and plodding at times but it is a McQueen vehicle
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like this app. It is easy to use and figure out. I like that you can have several different notebooks and that you can clearly label each of them. Highly recomended
0792833279|4.0|entertaining-- a little bit corny but Farina shines as well as Gandolfini. a good Elmore screenplay. a 4 star out of 5
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I like this game. Some of the levels are easy, some more challenging. I would recommend it if you like &#34;spatial relations&#34; games
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Superb performances by all and  great visuals all support a dark and haunting plot. Once of the best suspenseful films in recent years.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Doesn't let you get that far, but far enough to get addicted. But shows as free which it's not free.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I like watching the movie. I like Chris Hemsworth. My favorite Marvel Super Hero. Looking forward to Thor 2 in the fall.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I like how thin it is. I bought it on sale. I also like the fact it stands up my Kindle Fire.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kids love it! The sounds are cute and the game is fun.  Everyone loves those funny little Minions. Even us parents :)

B000SEIDR0|5.0|I had to read this book for class and I'm glad that I did.  Michael Pollan's book is an expose on the food chain and how virtually everything we eat begins with the plant &#34;corn&#34;. We need to be better stewards not only over animals and plants but over ourselves as well.  I had not idea that corn was involved in so many products.  Also it gives the reader an inside look in terms of how and where not only vegetables are grown or not grown to how Factory Animal Farming is big business.  It's a sad commentary on Agribusiness and the Government; and how these factory farms have manipulated the diets of animals all for the sake of money.<br /><br />Pollan is an excellent writer, sometimes too descriptive and gives too much information but all in all it's a good read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching Suits after my daughter and best friend recommended it.  I am so glad I listened to them.  Well acted and well written.  The chemistry between Harvey and Mike is evident in every episode.  I love Jessica, Donna, and Rachel. Louis is so believable in his role.  I detest Trevor and his trampy ex-girlfriend and hope they are gone for good.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app! I use it almost everyday! Very accurate! Glad I downloaded it! A weather must have!
B005WQ4RP6|4.0|This is a psychological thriller loaded with film stars. The story is about a convicted illiterate rapist (De Niro) who learns to read in prison and realizes his public defender (Nick Nolte) failed to introduce possible mitigating evidence in his trial, 14-years ago. (Rationale: The rapist had brutally beaten his victim and bragged about beating two prior similar charges.) Now released, he's seeking revenge.<br /><br />The movie is substantially weakened because of a number of highly improbable events - the first being that an imprisoned illiterate would learn to read to well that he could function as a qualified attorney and readily spout verbiage from various philosophers. The second - that a female friend of Nolte's would quickly take up with De Niro and allow herself to then be similarly raped. The third - that Nolte's 15-year-old daughter would be so stupid as to even get near De Niro.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the plot moves on and the pressures push Nolte to cross legal lines and indirectly hire three thugs to beat De Niro, then warn De Niro - who taped it. De Niro then has Nolte up on charges before the ABA for instigating the violence, but Nolte, upon advice of a hired P.I. (Joe Don Baker) only pretends to leave town to attend the hearing. Then the real violence and scariness begins -

B00004XPPE|5.0|An accidental thermonuclear first-strike attack by a group of Convair B-58 Hustler aircraft is launched in a mission against Moscow. It started with an alert initiated when radar reports the intrusion of an unidentified flying object into American airspace, followed by the standard procedure of directing several bombers already airborne to head for Moscow, awaiting a 'go code' before proceeding beyond 'fail-safe' points. Shortly afterwards, the flying object is seen to simply an off-course airliner and the alert is canceled. However, a technical error sends the 'go code' instead, and a new Russian jamming device coincidentally then begins jamming communications with the bomber group.<br /><br />President Henry Fonda cannot recall the group, and an effort to have fighters shoot them down fails (too late). Fonda calls his counterpart in Russia, desperately trying to avoid an all-out nuclear exchange. The Russians shoot down five of the six planes - one is still left. Fonda convinces the Russians it was an accident by having NYC bombed the same way Moscow was by the single remaining plane.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I've been playing Cubistry for at least six months.  I enjoy playing Cubistry so much I simply must play at least twice per day before I go to bed. You play by matching symbols on a 3D cube.  My best time is five minutes, go ahead and best me!
0307887898|5.0|I started the book thinking that I would not like it. The author of the book started the company IMVU. I remember the pop ads I would get for their instant message service back in the MySpace days. Luckily, I stuck with the book and found that his experiences when working on that service, were very insightful. The book wasn't about his end result but about the learning that should take place in order to make progress in the marketplace. It's a very good look at how companies can become customer-centric, as well as growth attaining and sustaining by using lean methods borrowed from science, management and other disciplines.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|the movie was very entertaining as I grew up in LA.  the acting and plot were pretty good.  Although after the movie I researched the real story and it didn't match the movie (I guess it's hollywood)
B0058SNI5S|5.0|So I hate Crocs but decided to try these - they are probably the most comfy shoes I own.  The drawback from any Crocs is when your feet start sweating - they make that awful noise.  Great shoe otherwise.
B0041KVZ1I|1.0|Let me save you the time and trouble, I ordered this record and a Hard days night. I could not believe these were new records. Abbey road badly warped, finger prints and dust and scratches all over it. What a shame.  A hard days night was not warped but finger prints, scuffed and dirty.<br />I had reservations about ordering a record from a digital master, but since they are going back I will never know.<br />I do not like cd's, much is missing from them. Do a little homework and see why some people prefer analog and not digital if you are curious. Also Amazon put these reviews with both cd's and vinyl like they are the same thing, there not.<br />The only good thing I can say about them is they are nice and heavy records like the early Beatles and other records were. What could have been.....<br />Auction web site here I come.<br />For the most part I have been happy with Amazon, this is an exception and customer service has made me happy, not easy to do as I expect quality and except nothing less.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Great download - season five is a great one.  Will be downloading more of the Dexter shows soon.  Great show.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Real fun and amazing game. Highly recommended. Works excellent on Asus tablet and HTC 1x smart phone. Very minimal apps and absolutely beautiful graphics.

B004BDJS9Q|5.0|Streaming looked lovely. I always enjoy watching this movie with friends. It's so much fun! Why is Amazon requiring a minimum word count? That's super annoying.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|I did not see it at the theater but did read about it. I can see how the assumption was made that torture helped to capture and kill Bin Laden but if that was so it was worth. The movie was very fast moving and the plot lost me a couple of times. I want to watch it again but have not done so.<br />The quality of the film, the acting and the sound were all great and I loved it.

B000HL2J0G|3.0|I stream Amazon video via a Roku and it may start a bit pixelated, but soon clears up. The technology fades away and let's me enjoy they show I watched in my youth.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|This game has a lot of content, but it's really just kind of boring. There's quite a bit of talking, and the voices are so annoying. A few parts are frustrating because the clicking is slightly off. Overall, it's a good way to kill some time. It's not too difficult, and each chapter provides a few different things to do.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have had no problems with this case at all. My phone has dropped from a dormer bed in college to the floor and has not broken with this case (but i would not risk it, it could be chance!). The clear case allows me to put stickers on the back of my phone, have them protected by the case, and to show them off. The screen protector has kept my phone screen perfectly intact. Would recommend to anyone who wants a simple go to case.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game. It's hard to find games that have everything, but this game has it. The graphics and movement are nice and smooth. The storyline and the games are entertaining. I would recommend this game.<br />Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Very informative. A great read. I was held in suspense, my heart rate increased with each twist and turn.<br />Awesome!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|DVD in great condition and the soundtrack is just awesome! We loved them both. Very original movie and I love the songs are sung by the people in the movie.
B00594XOZU|3.0|If you get ghe kindle version you can go to the cards witch means no memes or youtube videos. So if someone sends you something from cards u can even view it. All it dose is bring you online to the google and yplay store. You can even update it from there. The setup is also really crappy. So if you are really desperate to have kik messenger on your kindle, i sugest you wait until they fully update the app.
1932735410|5.0|We trust the books by Rita Mulcahy. They've never failed us. Very thorough information and the study DVD included is a great help!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a great game to play especially if you are good at memorization or need to work on your memory. Fun and I have to challenge myself when I played this game for the first few times, I SUCKED, but I'm getting alot better as I keep playing.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|I know what you're thinking... Why would I rate this three stars? Well, honestly it didn't compare to Maze Runner. Once again the Gladers head out into yet another Trial where everything is a test. Really everything was pretty good except two things.<br />My first issue was his new opinion of Theresa. Their relationship gets thrown around and it really screws up what I loved about them!<br />Secondly, I felt a loss of intrigue in the essential plot. We already know that WICKED has been doing this to them and the partial reason why. I felt like almost too much was given away.<br />Other than these two things, it was still a decent read. It just felt like the author decided to switch what he was originally going to do with the series midway through the book.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I got this game as an app of the day and since have spent countless hours on it . for everybody that said it's to easy haven't finished the game because there is a ,bit of a challenge ,,,great job guys , really enjoyed this one !!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book before they made the movie and I have to say the book is WAY better than the movie. Great love story!
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This is always one of my favorite movies and the grandchildren love it too. Would recommend it to any one.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Uno and Friends is a very family fitted game! I LOVE to play it so much I almost play on the game all day!! The only thing I don't like about Uno and Friends is the ads come up too much. But besides that, Uno and Friends is a perfect.game to get!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Very entertaining.  My grand children really like it.  Would recommend it to anyone. I think all age groups would like it.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Its a great app the only problem i have is that the app should let you go to sd card to select music because my default music player doesn't recognise all of my music
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Very entertaining.  My grand children really like it.  Would recommend it to anyone. I think all age groups would like it.
B009RH9J7W|2.0|We couldn't make it stand properly or rotate without getting stuck. We found something we liked better for less price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm completely hooked. Stayed up all night, twice, because I just couldn't put this down. Can't wait to read more of this. If you're looking for a new author to add to your list of favorites, Hugh Howey fits the bill.
B0010T56J0|4.0|Enjoyed the music the most and the talent it takes to play the piano. A good look at the mind of an individual who looks at the world in a different light.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire HD.. The graphics are cute ... especially when the number disappears when the ninth one is placed. However, I play electronic sudoku for speed and the &quot;cute&quot; animation makes for a very slow response time ... I'm touching the next square I want to fill and the game is still fiddling with the last square. If you don't care about timing, then the game is great but I'm uninstalling.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot BluRay edition presents to me a superior film dramatizing historical events.  Men in war are commanded to not keep diaries, and thus, most if not every war memoir is a fictionalized account taken down well after the facts.  Das Boot stands on its own merits as a brilliant film.  Clinton Williams in Michigan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone with a heart. Very well written and thoughtful.it makes you appreciate being human in all its loveliness and terriblousness. Have Kleenex ready for when your heart is tugged and enjoy the glorious complexity of life through the eyes of this story.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This is a very easy to use product that is intuitive and has some nice features to it.<br /><br />But, if I can't save my edits, what's the point? I have tried about five different save options and none of them work.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The first book was good and a fast read but the second book was really boring. I am not a big fan of the writing style. It is a bit childish to me. I will read the last book though since I am more than half way done with the trilogy. I can at least imagine myself being there so it is decent enough for me to want to finish the trilogy.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|My girlfriend is hooked on Downton Abbey so I got her Season 2 on Blu-ray. She loves it. I checked with her...no issues with any of the disks. No problems at all.<br /><br />I did get this original UK version and told her there were a few extra minutes that weren't in the US PBS show, but she said she honestly didn't notice.<br /><br />Looks like I'm going to end up getting Season 3 for her before too long.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I would like the second season to come out onto amazon instant video. It kept me captivated. It is weird seeing Claire Danes play this role.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|this game is fun for everyone.  i even have my husband playing this now.  it moves quick and keeps our interest.  definitely worth the time
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|I enjoyed all the episodes. I kind of don't like when Dexter finds a new love interest. They all have been annoying women. Luckily he did kill the pyro she was the worse. I am interested in seeing how they are going to end this series. I'll be sad this will end but it is probably time to end. I couldn't wait for each episode and I would have a mini marathon or 2/3 episodes per night. It was like an addiction.
B00D5YNQ5E|4.0|For those concerned about these based on the other remasters - don't worry.  The quality of the vinyl is absolutely fantastic.  Knocking off a star because it's more expensive than it should be.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Neat to read this ol' book.. is it o' lass an' lad finding a secret garden an' sharing it together? Don't answer that.<br /><br />LOVE: HANNAH
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup:I refused to read any instructions and stumbled a bit through installation, I wanted to see how easy it is to just setup and go. First, I realized I need to plug in the power adapter, no problem ( none of the ad pics I saw showed a power adapter), setup is slightly confusing with the WiFi networks and the chromecast wifi.  I also did not download the app for my android device before attempting to use . Netflix wouldn't work with my Samsung TV so I called Netflix and they were already aware of the problem and fixed the issue. So, I went to YouTube and watched some movie trailers etc , and then went back to netflix and started watching the Hunger games with my 8 year old daughter.<br />To provide context, I had an apple to HDMI connector which was how I used to watched netflix on my large screen TVs.<br /><br />*Update* Netflix on my Apple iPad supports chromecast and I have used it successfully.<br /><br />*Jan 30, 2014 Update* I've had this for a few months and there are still not that many apps that support it. A pet peeve of mine is that I can't cast homemade videos and pictures from my stock android phone. None of the native Android apps cast, you have to purchase an app for this, ridiculous.<br /><br />I uploaded my home videos to youtube to cast, but apparently if your home video is not set to public it will not cast.  I think the native android apps should support casting.<br /><br />Rating dropped to 4 stars
0152048049|5.0|I purchase the book to read to my grandchildren and  great grandchildren when the come to visit. It a great gift.  Thanks.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is LOL good. I love Tina Fey and after reading this I only love her more. Smart, funny and kind - it's a great read.
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|Like evil dead 2013, this movie may look scary, BUT IT'S NOT. Don't waste your time like i did, you wanna know whats scary about this movie? That I spent $14 to see it in theaters.Now that is pretty damn scary!
B008XCM18Q|3.0|Robert Ludlom's The Bourne Identity is definitely action-packed and entertaining; however, the writing is confusing at times and even lacks sufficient clarity. The imagery used is somewhat lacking, but it indeed gets the general picture across.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|It was a gritty and amazing end to the Dark Knight saga. Excited for what will be next for him..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft on my computer and decided to get it on my kindle and it is great.  If you like PE I recommend you buy the full Pc version.
B00821OX98|1.0|This series was apparently made for children.  Fine for them.<br />The acting is okay, but the story line is too old and too used.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Great game :) However, lately I have not been able to collect blocks, the blocks just sit there :( This glitch desperately needs to be fixed :( Fix this please :(
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|It's taking some getting use to. Love my angry birds! A large part of my daily entertainment! Fly on, my angry little friends!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Being a fan of the humor/horror genre, I accidentally stumbled on this movie and had to own it so I could watch it over and over. Great actors and script.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thought I was just going to read about the accomplishmentsf of Tesla when I downloaded this book.What a wonderful surprise to instead find a pedagogical treatise on imagination and an inspiring narrative on how to accomplish great things in my life. Thank you for a wonderful gift!
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|It's not a bad movie and I even got one for my granddaughters but for some reason, it was just different than I thought it would be.  It's almost impossible to outdo the original.
B001P4ESGC|3.0|it was okay. I really don't like shows where they show future and then go back and do it several times in one program.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I started with the first one and gone  on since then.  Each book develops new and interesting characters and often brings back oldies but goodies.  Thanks Lee Child, please keep them coming.  I am a 50+ female and Webb enjoy all the gun references.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This is a great app that is user friendly, easy to use and makes great edits.  If only it would save the final product.  Maybe if I had a Facebook account??
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I started with the first one and gone  on since then.  Each book develops new and interesting characters and often brings back oldies but goodies.  Thanks Lee Child, please keep them coming.  I am a 50+ female and Webb enjoy all the gun references.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Expendables 2 is enjoyable and great action flick, you will get know most of American movie stars.you love it ...
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I started with the first one and gone  on since then.  Each book develops new and interesting characters and often brings back oldies but goodies.  Thanks Lee Child, please keep them coming.  I am a 50+ female and Webb enjoy all the gun references.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. When I started watching it online, I found myself to be hooked...and Season 3 was the best so far. Lots of laughs but lots of tears, too. Keep some tissues handy. I can't wait for the next season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm just watched the movie and the game is so similar I love it. It has so many things to do and it is addictive.
1401233384|4.0|Other than the fact that it did not come bagged and boarded, i am very pleased with it and happy to have it in my collection
B0053KWDES|5.0|I bought this amp back in 2011, and have used it regularly since then. It has been powering a pair of Audio Technica ATH-ES55, and did a very good job. Used a Cowon J3 as the source.<br /><br />The Fiio E11 is solidly built, using an entirely plastic construction. For the price, this is not surprising. The black finish can pick up fingerprints, but in usage this isn't really a problem. The small housing over the volume knob is a nice feature, and prevents sudden changes in volume when moving around. The battery is a use-replaceable 'Nokia style' BL-5B, which means that in the event of the death of the battery, it can easily be replaced. This also has the benefit of allowing the replacement of the batteries on-the-go, so you can always carry a spare.<br /><br />This leads me to a downside. The E11 is based on another amplifier, using the exact same three channel design. It uses a 'virtual ground', as well as a real ground, meaning that the amplifier cannot be used when it is charging. This means it has limited use as a desktop amplifier, and should only really be looked at for portable use. This wasn't an issue for me, as I rarely use headphones at home.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic. It's not on the same levels as the O2 or Schiit Magni for audio quality, but it does produce a nice sound. Bass is good (there are three options for a bass boost on the E11), the middle is thick but the highs are 'pulled-back', that is to say, it has a 'dark' sound. The bass boost is nice, giving you the option of Off, 1 or 2. The first stage of the bass boost I found to be genuinely good. The second stage really just muddies the bass, and so I couldn't recommend using that option.<br /><br />Lithium batteries do not like being fully discharged, so it is recommended that when the battery becomes low on power (the indicator light will start blinking and music output may become choppy) that you stop it there and recharge as soon as possible. This issue happened at the end of my products life (I replaced it with a Fiio E12), so it was not a problem, however it is still worth mentioning.<br /><br />I rate it 5 for my own use, since I never intended to use it as a desktop amplifier. If you want a desktop headphone amplifier, you should see what else you can find first.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Creative plot but poorly developed main character (the husband) and the dumbest ending ever.It's as if the writer ran out of enthusiasm and grew bored and decided to just end the book with no creativity at all.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini did it again with this book.  He is a brillant writer intertwining the stories of families and generations.  Don't put the book down for too long or it may take a while to figure out how everyone is related to each other.
B000002PCS|5.0|This CD is easy to play over and over , it just seems to be seamless . A perfect soundtrack for this movie .
B008N1LL42|4.0|Battleship is a good movie to watch and even thought its really got nothing to do with the board game. Its still a nice watch.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|As others have wrote, I can confirm that saving doesn't work on a stock T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3.<br /><br />If saving worked it would easily be a 5-star review, but a major bug like this should have never occured.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters And Men has some of the best song I've heard in awhile. I would buy this again for a friend.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is great fun and not too overwhelming as to what to do. T h e hints were nice to f all back but not really needed
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Twenty One Pilots has made one great album from start to finish. A must buy. Take a listen to the album.
B008EKOO46|3.0|Much more stunted and less focused than his other work.  Still some good but much more difficult to read.many of the points the author is trying to make seem to lack real evidence
B00C5ZORES|4.0|Fall Out Boy Does it a again. A must have album for fans of Fall Out Boy. Take a listen.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Name of the Wind was an excellent book, I read the second book right after this one.  A wonderful adventure story.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is a great listen from start to finish. I listen to this album in my car all the time.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Fun game. Puzzles find hidden objects. skip dialogue. Kill time. Game saves your place. I need at least ten more words here.
B00CU0UE0E|4.0|I was hoping for more on this album and it seem I really only liked the Safe and Sound song
0547884591|5.0|as i have read to 4 hour work week and the 4 hour body, 4 hour chef was similar but much more focused on fast learning strategy
B0089LOG02|3.0|I enjoyed the novel.  I thought it would have more details of the teenager.  Interesting topic though, I enjoyed it despite how sad it was.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Bought this for my daughters, but they are a little young for some of John Green's books, so I read it first.  I really loved this story, and devoured it in two days while on vacation.  By the end, I was crying my eyes out, which I just don't do often when reading.  It's a great story, and Mr. Green is an amazing author.
1476734941|5.0|This is and ideal Guy Diet -<br />It doesn't require to count calories and only requires dicipline. The 600 calorie days are pretty simple. Oatmeal for Breakfast and a Can of Chunky Soup for lunch done. I mean you are not going to starve on this amount or food. I dropped 12 pounds in 6 weeks from 187 to 175.<br />Been on it for about 6 months now. I know when my eat windows are and keep busy during those periods. I feel great and it is easy!!!
B00E8B1358|5.0|If you liked the first movie or thought it was ok then you will want to watch this one.  Lots of action, and in my opinion, a good story.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My 7 year old son loved this lego set.  He loves Minecraft and plays it regularly.  This was the first set that he has put together and left together for days!  It is expensive, but there are a lot of little pieces and the final result is pretty neat.  In my opinion, Lego is almost always worth the money!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch.  It did not drag me into the story, but the visuals are awesome.
B000HEVALC|5.0|It was great to hear the originals talking and singing casually.  I am an Elbis fan and he was featured most
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like the app but after you run out of coins then you're on your own. No way to play unless you pay.  Not really free is it.  Sorry but will be removing this app.  It's useless, I can't play it.  No more coins.  No way to earn more.<br /><br />Update since my last review.  The app has in the last 24 hrs has started giving me free scratches every 45 mins.  This changes my whole attitude about this.  Thank you for the fix.  The app is really a lot more fun now!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting. my only complaint is it takes a long time to load. but it is worth the wait!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game although sometimes it really stumps me i love and i hope that everyone else that has tried this game enjoys it(:
B008602KQI|4.0|They would be hard pressed to make a movie as good as the book, but they came pretty close.  I watched the movie before reading the book and found it forgettable. Once I read the book, I watched the movie again and it made more sense to me.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|the kids still seem to like it even though it is an older movie.  Still nice for adults as well.
B002RVCD46|3.0|Like most of the Harry Potter movies, they took some liberties with the book.  Naturally I didn't expect it to be just like the book but as long as it was I expected it to be truer to the book.  I have been fairly disappointed with most of the movies having read the books first and watching the movies afterward.  They simply don't have the depth of the books and the reasons for some of the characters' actions aren't really explained properly.  Really felt they could have done a better job.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The directors cut was the best choice I could've made while purchasing this movie. I love how this film has a cult-like fan base and I'm happy to be part of it. To the beginning darko's, this is the one to buy if you are in search of some explanations for this bada** film!!
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I enjoy watching Wil Wheaton's show &#34;tabletop&#34; which features tabletop games like Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, and Star Fluxx.  Elder Signs was also featured on the show and I liked how cooperative it was.<br /><br />I downloaded the Kindle version and started to play, having never played the tabletop version.  The tutorial is short but thankfully there are instructions you can refer back to at any time.<br /><br />The game is incredibly challenging and you're likely to lose many times.  It's not a simple game, which is why it's not only held my attention for weeks unending, but makes each win that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is the variety of monsters. 2 &#34;normal&#34; 2 &#34;hard&#34; and 2 &#34;very hard&#34;.  The DLC are also &#34;very hard&#34; monsters.  It would've been more enjoyable to have 2 &#34;easy&#34; monsters and only when you win against the &#34;easy&#34; and &#34;normal&#34; monsters does the &#34;hard&#34; and &#34;very hard&#34; unlock.<br /><br />I also like the variety of investigators.  Each have their own special skill, allowing you to build your team the way you like to play.  The DLC investigators are worth the $2 or $3.<br /><br />Overall, worth the money.  But if you are impatient, buy another game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love playing this game. Just the right amount of challenge for me. Keeps getting just a little more involved each level.
B00DM12ANO|3.0|This movie had great vistas and a great premise, but the plot left a little lacking. It was worth the rental.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This band coninues to deliver solid material with every song holding its own. Thanks to Sat radio and pandora we can discover cool bands
B00E8B1358|3.0|The acting and writing is sub-par but the cliff scene with the ninjas was pretty cool.<br />The ending was lackluster too...<br /><br />Only watch if you keep a special place in your heart for G.I. Joes and bad movies.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Love the film in its full uncut version so things like Elwood having a can of spray adhesive made sense. The music is incredible and having been through Chicago a couple of times it was cool seeing the sites while zipping down streets like Wacker Drive. Film also turned more people on to the Blues. Here in Maine the city of Rockland hosts the annual Atlantic Blues Festival every summer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played I think it is fun exeped the jumping shoes are annoying but I gusese it makes the game more fun
B00A83075M|5.0|Loved the movie when we saw it in theaters and bought it as a gift for my kids. Great for kids and adults.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend who loved this movie.  It was affordable and I had it in a matter fo days.  Thank you Amazon!
0385537816|5.0|Books came and were shrink wrapped. The pages weren't evenly cut but all the content was there. I had read these books on my tablet first and bought these so I could read from a book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best game ever!!!!! I freaking love love LOVE this game and I can't stop playing it!!!!!! Everyone should get this game it's awesome!!!!!
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I had caught the end of this movie while I was out and enjoyed the end and had to figure out the rest of the story. I bought it and my daughter & I both love it. Different type of story and really enjoy all of the characters in it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|This was my first Gaiman novel, and what a book!  I refuse to spoil anything in it, other than the fact that adventure, magick and love abound.
B001KZG99A|5.0|The story line was simple and kept me trying to anticipating what happens next. All the high tech stuff was great, especially the mobile phone. The actors and actress blended really great. Of course the historic line of good vs. evil, was never boring, even though the ending was predicable. I would see this series in the future. REV
B000FC130E|5.0|Gotta love Neil Gaiman's writing!  Magic, adventure, love, but not a romance novel.  Totally amazing.  Funny, happy, poignant, surprising... yeah, read it.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Well written and addictive! Couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. I would recommend it! I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading but I was glad I chose this book...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a thoroughly researched, insightful, and thoughtful text. It has profoundly impacted my thinking with regard to Christianity, and the leaders of organized religion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow, so I ordered the Chromecast the day it was released and got it within less than a week. It really is the way they describe it, plug in and play. All my devices work on it (iPad, iPhone, and Windows laptop). Best part is you can keep browsing and doing whatever you want and it'll stream to your TV. The quality is HD1080P, and what I didn't know is that it transmits the sound as well. It only works with Netflix, YouTube, and a few other apps, but according to Chromecast's Facebook page, they are working on allowing everything to be transmitted soon. For $35, I am a very happy guy!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game.  Fun and addictive! It's like crack, but legal. I play this for hours on end. Great time waster.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I LOVED this book! At first it was just a choice for a summer reading book but then when I got into it, it was just amazing book. I'd say this is a must read great job Orson
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love all their music and have their iTunes Session, their self titled album, and then Golden.  I played one of the songs to an audio engineer and he guessed the genre was country/pop.  I agree.  Its not country/country.<br /><br />Beautifully recorded, great imagery, sound stage.  Audiophile quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|After playing other escape games that leave you to figure out the puzzle, this game is pretty self explanatory while still being entertaining.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love match 3 games..good graphics and a fun game to build on.  Like the story behind it.  Easy to understand.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|Didn't get to see it but I got charged for it. I keep getting \\"Insufficient Bandwidth\\" errors. Amazon says its me but I have an 8 Meg connection with no one else on it. Not likely.  Apple TV and NetFlix both work flawlessly.
B00006AW2J|5.0|What can I say, it's the Rolling Stones at their peak! &#34;Factory Girl&#34; and &#34;No Expectations&#34; and &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; and all the great songs are on it. This CD seems to get stolen from my collection the most.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game is ok but not what I expected. The viewing is very small so when aiming at the bubbles sometimes you will miss your target. Did not get the reason for it title. But its playable.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game used to be ad-free. So today I'm getting ads after every two or three runs. Bad move guys... minus four stars.
0804165734|4.0|The book, being totally honest, got very dull at some parts, especially on the second-half. It's very refreshing having the narratives spoken to you by audio voices. The only peeve I have with this is that the narratives are read, and nothing more. There's hardly any emotion, nor character embodiment to be said of. Heck, there's not even background music to accompany the really creepy moments. This might be me just ranting, in that this is the first audiobook I've ever purchased and listened to, but all in all I can't feel that this product is complete without the things I mentioned, which is why it didn't get 5 stars. Even still, I do recognize the fact that there were a lot of things the composer did get right, such as the race, dialogue, age, etc. of the voices. This is a much better option than dry-reading, most definitely worth the money.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|It is completely unfathomable that the perpetrators of the financial collapse of 2008 have not been imprisoned. And worse; they were bailed out of the financial crisis by the government – while the rest of us suffered. This is an incredibly informative video. I highly recommended it!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie was a fantastically epic look back at world war 2, all while introducing a super hero that never ceases to astonish, nor surprise.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|It's fun and challenging but not so hard as to lose interest. The puzzles have enough clues to figure them out without giving you the solution. Overall it kept me entertained for several days playing several hours at a time,
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love DragonVale!! My friend mentioned I try it and after that I got hooked! I'm loving all of the new dragons and everything they're bringing to the game.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I had read the brief description of this film several times and always passed it over because it just sounded too quirky/weird/dark. But I am so glad I just went for it. I loved it. Cooper and Lawrence do an amazing job portraying the reality of struggling with mental illness--there are highs, lows, insights, laughs, tears, and tantrums all throughout. An unexpectedly fresh romantic/dramatic comedy.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|I didn't understand the point of the game every time I went to play it would freeze and my device would shut down it is either a glitch or bad wifi redemption.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Funny and entertaining law show. I keep watching season 1 & 2 over again and it just keeps getting better and better.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This cd is really good, the whole thing is original with some homages to his own work such as a few familiar riffs.  Buy it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this because I new there was a movie version coming out.  It was a good read and I found Ender to be a great SCI FI character.  The story was a little predictable but The ending was unexpected.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Predictable and boring-not one I'd recommend-not that I was  a fan of the first one -James got really lucky :)
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This a classic perfect love story.  There are days that the old movies just can not be beat.  Acting is great and the costumes are fantastic.  Great family movie or chic flick.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|This is a fun book to read; bet you can't guess who did it.  Those who like Michael Connelly will not be disappointed.
B004S3X9ZS|4.0|I like the electro sounds and combo of the female and male vocals.  It is a good soundtrack to play in the car for a while.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Great action video and special effects; best I've seen in a long time. Kept one engaged. Willis was excellent as usual.
B000063S6Z|3.0|This CD is a good one for the car. Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday) is my favorite song. Ethereal, melancholy, the human condition. My brother says the CD sounds depressing, which is fine with me. Mom calls it funeral. Some really good songs and some definite &#34;skips.&#34; Some are a bit repetitive on the same style and theme. Moby's still the man!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I came across this movie in Amazon's suggestions and I was so pleased it did! I haven't seen this movie since I was younger! Reasonably priced and arrived quickly.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|I love Antionioni but this movie was disappointing. Maybe because it was in color haha! It was a bit too mod, erratic. I love erratic but a discordant erratic.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book feels like it was written soley for the purpose of finishing the series. I was disappointed by the focus on concluding the series instead of offering a fun story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great app it is cool because there are three different levels and bosses .so I recommend this app for everybody.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|I just love Harry Bosch. He doesn't let life's realities such as sleeping or eating interfere with his relentless pursuit of answers. I never know how the story is going to end. This book is as good as the last 20 or so. But now, Harry understands cell phones and the internet and we can stop waiting for him to find a payphone to call for backup.
B0080SW3CC|4.0|it arrived with a few tears and a little damage, but the book was still great! (there are four more words required)
B00A27X972|4.0|This is the same genre (alien takes over human form) but less romance and more thought provoking scifi.  Perhaps the most humorous aspect was the challenge of understanding how the human form works -- and why in the world it was designed as it was!  Haig does a great job of looking at our form through alien perceptions with wit, humor and heart.  Along the way to understanding humans our hero develops even more as a sentient being as emotions are added to the repertoire.  All in all a good and engrossing read.  Why only a 4?  As others noted (and a reason to consider the time investment) the novel begins with a bang, but does get a bit bogged down in philosophical musings and long &#34;big&#34; thoughts about half way through.  (Full disclosure -- this is a good place to practice your speed reading.)

B002ZG98C8|1.0|Machete is a pretentious political drama disguised as a fun action movie.  This film was set up to be a fun revenge movie like Deathwish.  However, it soon becomes a pretentious commentary about the border.  Those two things do not really fit together.  Those things would be fine in separate films, but together they create a cluttered mess of a film which is what we have here.  I thought that it was unneeded and it made the film very boring for me.<br /><br />The plot is too crowded.  All of the marketing for this film made it out to be a balls-to-the-walls actions movie.  However, it's like the makers of the film saw all of the issues about the border that were really big at that time and decided to work it into the story.  As I said earlier that is a bad move on their part.  I would be fine with a story dealing with the Mexican border if it does not detract from the action and Machete himself, which is what happened.  The film should have focused more on Machete and him getting revenge and the stuff about the border should have been in the background.  Instead the revenge story is mostly an afterthought.  It tries to be both a smart commentary about the border and a corny action movie at the same time, and it really does not manage either.  You have much political dialogue in a lot of scenes trying to make you take it seriously, while you also have over-the-top scenes Machete using a guy's intestines to onto another floor of a building.  That does not work.<br /><br />The characters are not that great either.  The main character Machete (Danny Trejo) is actually an entertaining character.  If this film was a straightforward action movie he'd be fine.  The problem is we do not spend as much time with him as we should and his priorities seem out-of-whack to me.  The supposed main villain, Torrez (Steven Seagal), killed his wife at the beginning of the film.  Instead of going after Torrez to get his revenge he is just wandering around Mexico looking for work.  I think that this is there so they can introduce the boarder issue.  I think that a lot of potential characterization for Machete is lost because of too much political dialogue getting in the way.  If the movie was not concentrating so much on the border and hammering home a message we could have had more time with Machete and him getting revenge like he should be doing.<br /><br />The other characters are not much either.  Jessica Alba plays a border patrol officer, which immediately lost me.  I do not buy her as an officer for one second.  Michelle Rodriguez is alright but she is not in the movie that much.  Jeff Fahey does the best job here in my opinion.  I am a fan of Jeff Fahey from when he appeared in Lost.<br /><br />Steven Seagal got it the worst.  He was setup in the beginning to be the main bad guy of the film.  However, after the beginning we only see him on a computer screen.  Then at the end he appears out of nowhere to fight Machete to wrap up his arc.  The fight was very lackluster.  Machete does not even kill him.  He kills himself for some reason.  The whole ending was pretty lame to be honest.<br /><br />There is some good about the film.  The film looks nice.  The effects look decent besides some scenes with obvious CGI blood.  The action scenes were okay (besides the ending), but there were not that many of them.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very lame revenge flick.  All the marketing said it was a revenge/action movie.  Instead we got a lame commentary about the border, which does not interest me at all.  I would skip this one if you are thinking of seeing it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm 20 I love the movies so it was a given that I had to download the game, which I surprisingly LOVE !!!! It's like a more entertaining version of subway surfers. The only thing I don't like is it takes forever to get gr8 coins !! Over all great game !!!

B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Whenever a Tom Cruise movie comes out I check it out; they always are entertaining, well-produced, have strong scripts and good acting. REACHER excells on all points. It's even the Smartest Cruise movie I've ever viewed, even surpassing Jerry McGuire and Collateral in smart writing and ploting. It's more clever, and in the mystery/action category it offers more tension, trickiness and realistic violence I can remember in any flick of its kind for a long time; nothing's gratuitous; it's all linked together with plot concepts and makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The pace never stops; in fact momentum builds, augmented by subtle false leads, good, often hidden clues  and misleading characters. I've seen it twice throughout and am now mid-way through round number three. (Aside from being a film fanatic, I usta write for a living; now, olde and retired, I only write reviews for Amazon and production notes for myself)<br /><br />My five stars for Reacher covers all elements. Into viewing number three it's still tricky and smart.<br />Cruise as Reacher is perfectly cast while he seems really, sharply into the role's many levels.
B00005A0ZH|5.0|This is a lush, well documented Ridley Scott masterpiece. Few know that Columbus made four voyages and that, not only was his discovery denigrated by Amerigo Vespucci's (he was credited for first landfall on the North American continent) but that on the fourth voyage, Columbus reached the isthmus of Panama without ever seeing the Pacific Ocean! Balboa got credit for that one.  The court of Queen Isabelle of Castille and King Ferdinand of Aragon and their campaign of reconquista in the backdrop of exquisite Moorish architecture and ornate gowns was captivating.  This film should be shown in every history class with the lessons of unintended consequences and heros often gone unsung.

B00CMQX84A|5.0|We have watched this movie at least a dozen times on TV so we bought the DVD.  It is one of the cutest movies I have seen in awhile. My little grandson goes between pretending to be Butchy the leader of the bikers and Tanner, the beach boy.

B002MFULQO|5.0|The film was very well done bringing out many facts that I had no idea about. We are often told what to believe, instead of what is really the truth. I would recommend the film including showing in a high-school setting.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love the entire series, following social exploits of a British manner after WWI.... great show and you should watch it.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Tom Cruise saves the world (yet again) but it's a bit off the radar even for him.  I didn't particularly like the whole scenario of the world being sucked dry by aliens but there were a few moments that I enjoyed.  I found Morgan Freeman's character totally useless to the whole of the film, but I guess he was cast well with what he had to work with.  There are many Earth shattering moments in this film and the overall premise is OK, but I don't think Tom Cruise needs to continue making these types of films.  I mean, how many times can one man actually save the human race?  I prefer him in more realistic characters but it seems his bigger than life star status makes him think he has to be in bigger than life world saving movies.  This is a bleak film and totally unrealistic but I guess that's what we escape to the movies for.  I just think Cruise should be a real person in a movie about real life for a change.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|This Greatest Hits CD is really good and it has all of there top songs from the 90's and early 2000's. This CD would be perfect except that one of the songs has been redone by the band. &#34;Name&#34; is one of the best songs they have ever written and it was perfect when originally released. However that release is not what is on this CD.  The redone version isn't bad and after a few listens is pretty good but still not as good as the original. Although its still worth the buy for me this my be a deal breaker for others.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Come on update on kindle fire it has been more than a month I want realms. Other than that it's it is a good game.

B00AEFY44Y|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  The story is good and the acting was well done.  Whoopi Goldberg is especially good in this one.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I still don't understand why this show was cancelled. Perhaps it had only a cult following, but this would have at least been an epic mini-series. I loved that this movie was made to satisfy fans, but it still wasn't enough. This series had so much potential.
B008PZZMZK|4.0|This is a cute movie that plays to some of Julia Roberts (Ana Scott) and Hugh Grant (William Thacker) strengths.  Initially I thought that Ana Scott came off a little narcissistic, but the second time I watched the movie I enjoyed the foreshadowing between William and Spike about the important things in the world.  These nice little interactions tied some of the strings together and set the stage for later parts of the movie.  I think this movie has an interesting &#34;adult coming-of-age&#34; aspect that shows personal growth for not just the two main characters, but also William's group of friends.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Every time I play this it says to many controls added to the layout manager. After that happens my Kindle crashes

B009DCOU9S|3.0|I finished the game in an evening. Entertaining. The characters could talk a little less, but otherwise a decent game.
1592536913|5.0|The artwork in this book is lavish. Great care was taken to display each item in the best light. Even though there are 1,000 creations in the book, I wanted more.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|A bit long...but good. Could have easily cut an hour off this movie and it would have been even better!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Would have like to see more of a story, some parts very unbelievable like walking normal in the open hanger.  However very watchable for free, cannot complain there.
B003B02OOG|3.0|I found this read to be a surprisingly a good one. These short stories have different twists on the legal system than most of Grisham's books. I found them more entertaining than the Theo Boone books. The suspense is still there but in a different way.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|I listen to Sinatra in the car.  The music is toe-tapping good!  I'm sure people are amused that I sing along to the songs.

B0017SWSCW|4.0|When you read his novels his heroes become you because the character development is so strong it absorbs your personality into their's.  His novels are also an education in life.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great just like my friend said it would be, I love the graphics, plus its free. Everyone should get this if they can. Great Game!!!
159562015X|3.0|Wasn't what I expected.  I think the plan they lay out for you after you take the test reeks of standardization.  Kind of hard to pinpoint everyone since each individual is unique.  My expectations were too high.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|My wife is a big Wizard of Oz fan and was very disappointed by this movie.  Both kids, including our 10 year old, had nightmares, thankfully only that night.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very good movie and I wish I had bought it rather than renting so I could watch it over and over.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Fast paced. Exciting. Thrill ride. Knights in armor. New love. Court intrigue . Every thing you want in an epic adventure
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Wanted to watch this on HD but only the later doctors have that.  Every episode froze at least once with a loss of connection Amazon end, and sometimes the images would whoosh ahead of the sound.  I'm going back to Netflix.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Very good story line.  Both Christine and the Phantom have wonderful voices.  I had to watch the movie twice in order to grasp everything.
B0065CCM76|5.0|The Ultimate Hits album is just that!!! If you like old school Seger, this is the one. It is excellent!!!
B009NX61JY|4.0|Slow starter... hang in their it starts to improve after about 30 minutes.  Not your typical relationship, but it was amusing.
0553386697|5.0|Great book, buying it for all of the new Mom's in the family! Wish I would have had this book 30 years ago!
1426308469|5.0|This book is excellent! It has beautiful pictures on each page, but unlike other dinosaur books, it's not scary. Each page has a little bit about each dinosaur- when they lived, what they ate, how to pronounce their name, etc. My 2 year old and 4 year old want me to read this book to them every night.
0385737955|5.0|I obviously had to read it all in one sitting because it was great! I finished at about 3am and then could not go to bed. I was crying partly because of the book and how surprised I was and partly because I didn't have the second book yet. It's great! Buy it. Read it. Love it. Keep it. Re-read it later.
B000IZ0KRK|4.0|Pretty cool lesson.  Didn't realize that this happened--it happened so quickly.  Great acting and HBC is always so terrific! I'd watch it again.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Plot twist and surprise endings don't always work.  This movie reminds me of M. Knight Shyamalan's &#34;The Village.&#34;  In the end when we find out the creatures aren't real it isn't a cool surprise it's a disappointment.  I felt the same with this movie.  However, the concept of this futuristic, post apocalyptic earth is really cool.  The special effects are great and the sci-fi elements are very unique and original.  My hat goes off to the writer.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It is and amazing game it is new amazing well not eternally new but it is a amazing and to give u a little hint it is better on.the kindle fire hd so yeah just download it and trust me it is worth it
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|Very cute, my 7 year old daughter loves! It's quite sturdy, comes with some cute accessories!!! The Draculaura doll that comes with this set is one of the cutest Draculaura's yet!
0091939526|5.0|Many things worked, some didn't.  It was a reminder that I can control what shape I want to be in.  Nice kick in the head about personal choice and health.  I loved it !
B0040I09RM|5.0|Although, this is not for younger audiences, this is a great story line with several twists and turns. This series keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat.
034580404X|1.0|Although very detailed this trilogy was not very interesting. I bought them thinking I would spend atleast 2-3 weeks reading them, but to my surprise as soon I got through chapter 3 of the first book realized this book is insanely boring.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was so captivating. It sucks you in and doesn't let you go. By the end of the book you feel so connected to the characters that you don't want the story to end. I think I could have kept reading this story forever!
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I have only seen the first disk, but I was not at all pleased with the sound.  First it was normal, then it was so low that even at top volume it was hard to hear.  (NO, I do not have a hearing problem.)  It seemed to flucuate from one to another.  I could not really enjoy it because I was having to constantly moniter the volume button.<br />I think the series is very good, and it seems to accurately depict this period of time.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the early West.<br />I can only hope the rest of the disks are better in sound than the first one.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|APPLAUSE released an entire week ahead of schedule in an effort to thwart a potential leak. Fans were abuzz in the early hours of the morning listening to a low quality leak being played over popular website tinychat, while several high quality snippets had been floating around. When Gaga awoke this morning, she declared a POP EMERGENCY and kicked things into overdrive. In a spectacle of tweets and fan anticipation, we were given the Applause, broadcast simultaneously across US radio. While we got the first single off of ARTPOP seven days in advance, I think it's safe to say it would have been well worth the wait. With Applause, Gaga proves once again why she's the reigning Queen of Pop and leaves us wanting even more from ARTPOP, due to release 11/11/13.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a cute little game. Of course for free you can only do so much, but the music is southing and my is still fun.
B0038P80CO|3.0|This was a better than average sci-fi movie with a good premise. That said the movie did not break any new ground as far as the story goes.  A Noah's Arc ship sent from an over populated and exhausted resource planet earth is sent to a very distant earth like plant to save the human race. The ship has suffered some type of malfunction with a few crew members and passengers awake to attempt to save the ship and its crew from certain death. Crew members suffer from some type of ailment while battling a unknown life force thats attacking them and impeding their attempts to repair the ship. This is a generalization of the story to limit giving away to much info. I think that you get the picture and the jest of the story and how its the industry standard template for space, sea and land movies. The acting ranges from fair to good with so...so character development and written to be vague as far as the characters history goes and the same can be said of the creatures and their history. Some detail is given about the creatures, but it is a hypothesis given by crew members who have been awake the longest. I found all the vagueness with the crew and creatures history a little disappointing and limits the story. It could have been a much better story with more creative writing instead of what was written. The direction lacked some of the same creativity as well and was evident in the end product. Many people raved about this movie and thats good, but I was left wanting a more creative and detailed story than what I got. Was it better than average? Yes, but not by much. Was it worth the time to watch? Yes. Will I watch it again? Mabe at a later date. 3.4 stars.<br /><br />Rating 0 to 5 Stars<br /><br />Story = 3<br />Acting = 3<br />Direction = 3<br />Fear or Creep Factor = 3 Cool looking creatures.<br />Gore = 4<br />Violence = 4<br />Sex/Nudity = No/No<br />Foul Language = Yes, but used sparingly.<br />Entertainment Value = 3+
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I didn't download this app to my Kindle as first.  I went in under my email and password.  When I would open a page, whereever I was during the news feed, if I opened a page and return, it would take me  back to the very top of the news feed.  Once I downloaded this app, when I open a page, it stays where I am.  Duh, should have used the app in the first place :)  I am really enjoying checking messages now.  So much more to learn how to navigate on FB.  Excellent app!
0062255657|1.0|I don't understand how this book got such glowing reviews.  I appreciate imaginative, even weird stories, but this one was too far out there.  It seemed like the author was describing a disturbing dream in detail.  There did not seem to be a point, a moral, or any profound insight.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I haven't used this app very much to really know how to rate it.  Once I spend some time navigatiing through it, I'm sure I will enjoy it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Being an avid reader, I'm generally a huge advocate and believer for the book always being better than the movie, but in this rare instance, I actually surprised myself. I saw the movie for The Perks of Being a Wall Flower before I read the book, thinking that as good as the movie was, the book promised to be even better.  I was wrong!  Although I did enjoy the book and the extra depth of the characters and situations that I received as a general result of being a reader versus a watcher, I found myself preferring to put down the book and go back to watch the movie again instead.  I'm thinking that a good reason for this was because the actors in the movie version did an exceptionally phenomenal job, which was something I felt even more profoundly after reading the book and having a better understanding of the characters.  I'm not saying that everyone should just go out and watch the movie instead of read the book, as I did still enjoy the book....but for the first time, I honestly have to admit that I think the movie was better.  (It also probably helped that the author was I believe one of the main screenwrites for the movie, enabling the movie to stay as true to the book as possible).
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I like the camera, but it doesn't have a back camera.  You have to turn it half way side ways to take a picture of a subject away from you.  The only two things I like about it is: You can set the 10-second timer to take a group picture and you can take picture of  yourself or you have to be in the picture of a group pointing the camera fcaing the subjects.  App really need to be improved.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Can add all pics from my phone and pc to my kindle then play with them n then send them to get developed
0385347774|4.0|I enjoyed this book, though the slow start almost put me off.<br />Once I got into it the dual storyline was intriguing with both sides of the story slowly evolving.<br />I liked the twists and turns of the plot driven mostly by the characters - who are mostly unlikeable but make a riveting read.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|I have been playing with Playmobil as a kid and i bought this set for my daughter, it is amazing, it is a very LARGE box and set, I highly recommend it. The instruction were fairly easy to work with but it did take some time to build the entire set - I would say around an hour.
0399226907|5.0|Great book and the size is just right for small hands. I recommend this book to age newborn and up.

B00ANTX3HA|5.0|This is a deep documentary about an important (and smart) man, his behind-the-scenes view of a war that became an American tragedy and a time in America that colors our thinking about war to this day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book. I couldn't put it down. I'm looking forward to the next book. I hope it's as good as this one was n
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a big Gaiman fan, Sandman and all that, as well as the short stories, but - with the exception of Coraline - have never been that much enticed by his novels. They are OK, but not the same stuff of the other material.<br /><br />Gaiman tends to rewrite his novels (check American Gods and Neverwhere) and I felt that &#34;The Ocean...&#34; is largely Coraline. NOt exactly the same, to be sure, but the main elements are there. OK, now the threat has invaded our reality, rather than the hero neing trapped in the alternative universe, but, you know, this is hardly enough to change dramatically the story. We meet again the Three-Who-Are-One (Mother, Maiden, and Crone) and a child discovering a new, magic world.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the other books, you will enjoy it immensely (but would enjoy Coraline even more); if you are, you will have a good moment revisiting some stories. Not bad; just not as good as his very good stuff.

B00AX6KNOY|2.0|Nice try but I'm spoiled by movies with more substance.  This is an older fllm which may have been lively in it's day.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|I bought this disc for five dollars, so I'm not one to complain so much as others.  And unlike other reviewers the steampunk and exaggerated tones didn't bother me at all.  You get what you pay for. I really wanted to like this film, despite the spate of lousy reviews it received at its release.<br /><br />That it didn't follow the traditional Jonah Hex origin was not a concern to me; I like the comic, but Hex is not so well known as Superman that he rebukes a revisionist take on his story. I like Brolin and Malkovich, I love westerns when they are fun (*Brisco County Jr.* from the tube is a particular favorite, and it too used fantasy elements--but Brisco had charisma and humor, and I cared about the characters, even the villains. . . .), and I enjoy comic book adaptations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one point not too fully addressed in other reviews is my greatest pain with this film--its production quality is so darned DARK, the viewer can't tell what in God's name is going on for roughly thirty percent of the film.<br /><br />I realize the tone is supposed to be fiercely unrepentant and \\"dark hearted,\\" as per the protagonist's suffering. But here the form does not assist the content. A couple otherwise strong action sequences could have been much more effective if the light supervisor had allowed us to see who was who and what was taking place. Shadows are key in noir projects, but in classic films the audience can actually SEE what is happening. I tried turning off every light in the house to see if perhaps the director was shooting with subtle shades and tones to up the \\"heart of darkness\\" of the principals.  No. Getting up close to the screen didn't even help--and we have a good high definition screen.<br /><br />So it becomes difficult to assess the relative merits of a film shot without benefit of a flashlight. Still, here are a couple other simple opinions:<br /><br />*Megan Fox continues her ability to register emotions from A to Z, while capitalizing on her cleavage. Truly, this character is fleshed out only in appearance--Fox had very little to do except hit her mark and allow the wan light to illumine her figure. Oh yes, and she shot a gun a couple times.<br /><br />*Josh Brolin is a strong actor, but again the script gives him little to do but react with a sneer (which is part of the Hex personna anyway). His voice-over is sparse and ultimately unnecessary, a crutch the narrative does not need if it shows nuance on the screen. (But then we've already discussed why that's a problem. . . .)<br /><br />*John Malkovich could have been a great villain. Here he becomes a puppet to the machinery.  He's not given the chance even to chew the scenery--he doesn't have one scene where he can even gum it. Credit the screenplay with that loss.<br /><br />*It's only 72 minutes not counting the credits! Unless you're Bergman or Fellini, or Disney for that matter, most filmmakers can't tell a full story in a little over one hour--it comes off as underdeveloped, unrealized and ultimately uninvolving. Maybe this could have been a TV movie director's first outing, given the constraints of the one-hour format. Then it might have been worth coming back to the following week to develop the characters and story more.<br /><br />*Further, the DVD does not offer scene selections--perhaps the company determined there were not enough scenes to opt for that feature. This is a bare bones disc--a few deleted scenes, again piled one after another without a listing of how many or of what nature they are.<br /><br />*The whole production provokes two reactions in me: How I wish it had been helmed by Sam Raimi (I love *The Quick and the Dead* for its wry \\"playing\\" with the genre; I can forgive many quasi-goofy revisionist takes in that film because the people involved seem to be having so much FUN making it); and why is everyone, including Wil Arnett, sleepwalking through the show? Outside of a menacing tribal \\"exorcism\\" sequence involving crows and spirits, there's very little genuine emotion going on here.  The whole film strikes me as an exercise in stoicism. For the audience's sake, lighten up! (Literally in its shooting, and figuratively in the screenplay--humanize the puppets.)<br /><br />It just occurs to me that, for whatever reason--studio interfering, a rush to production, who knows?--very few people seemed to care about this film.  And by extension, much of the audience responds in kind.  I would rate the film a two for what it could have been; the DVD gets a two as well--for, again, a lack of care exercised.  It's five dollars from my pocket, and I guess comparatively that's what it's worth.

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan's book, Zealot, is a book developed for our time and place. Heretofore, we had experienced Jesus narratives written by contemporary evangelists or university scholars. Neither approach produced a Jesus that the rest of us could embrace. The evangelist conveyed a Jesus that frankly never existed, and the scholar -- who had a better handle on the truth -- was afraid to express what was really on his or her mind for fear of being criticized. Therefore enter Reza Aslan: bold, intelligent, and unafraid to convey the purpose behind the persons of Jesus, James, and Paul. Together their individual efforts would form Christianity, which permitted Aslan to synthesize their material into a very readable prose that even the least trained among us could understand.<br />I think a better title might have been something like \\"The Formation of Christianity\\" given that Reza's story was quite broad beginning around the time of the Babylonian Conquest of the Old Testament period and ending with the battle between Arius and Athanasius in the fourth century CE. What occurs between these two periods is what Christianity was made of. Had it not been for the Babylonian Conquest (or the Assyrian Conquest prior to it), the Jews would not have been in such a weaken state, which led to the early forms of the Diaspora and the occupation of Judea by Roman general Pompey in 63 CE. All this led to the growth of the eschatological literary genre, tools of the trade of such Major Prophets as Isaiah and Jeremiah. If it were not for Jeremiah 23:5, would there have been a Jesus as Messiah?  Would there have been a need for one if Isaiah had not written chapter 61 verse 1 of his text? Given that Jesus was the progenitor of a new messianic movement, his brother James would be called to manage the early Jerusalem ecclesia after his death. As with any good story, however, there needed to be an adversary, the complete opposite of James, a role assume by Paul. James and Paul battled over orthodoxy, with Paul ultimately winning the battle for followers over the long haul. The sermons we now hear in the modern church are not from the church of Jesus and James but rather from the church of Paul. This should not so difficult to discern; most sermons are taught straight from Paul's letters. We should be able see the handy work of the Roman Emperor Constantine as he took Paul's Christianity and made it the state religion of Rome. The evolution of the church since the time of Constantine has been so utterly detached from the historical Jesus. Might this have something to do with the success of Reza's \\"Zealot.\\"

I have since bought the DVD and still enjoy it. I have seen the other versions and I don't think they compare with the performances of Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintohl. I felt I was reading the book they were so faithful to it, not like the other versions. I think Jane Austin would have approved.

Women are treated as trash, and there is no apology for the graphic harsh treatment they are subjected to.  The blood and gore are bad enough, but, as a self-respecting woman I cannot watch it.  Vikings represents and equally brutal society, but women are usually represented as respected human beings.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I'm a fairly big sci-fi fan, though I'm far from hard-core. My favorite recently has ben Prometheus, and while Oblivion isn't up to that standard, it's not bad either. It definitely seems to draw elements from other major films in the genre, but honestly, it's getting pretty difficult to be truly unique. Oblivion weaves together a number of common sci-fi elements, and does a good job of it.<br /><br />Acting was good, Cruise was great as always. Morgan Freeman was a good choice as well.<br /><br />If the negative reviews are getting you down on this film, and you're not a sci-fi superfan, I'd give it a shot. It's one of the better ones of this summer...

1480507024|5.0|While not exactly an untold story, this well researched epic history is a very fresh viewpoint, almost a Russian eye view of US policy in the nineteenth century. S&K seem to idolize Henry Wallace, influential progressive (some say Communist) cabinet member and FDR's 3rd term VP. Their account implies a better America if Wallace had been allowed to retain the vice-presidency and subsequently become president in place of Harry Truman. S&K examine domestic and foreign policy of every administration from Wilson to Obama. For their own agenda they pursue a tax the rich policy with popular statistics.<br /><br />The book starts with the Wilson era, describing Wilson as a bigoted ideologist who couldn't countenance disagreement and subsequently failed in all his high minded objectives. One theme seems to be that, except for the somewhat ambivalent example of FDR, the US has not had a decent president in the last hundred years or longer. The book promotes the progressive movement initiated by T. Roosevelt and Wilson. It accuses FDR of promoting a war policy. It even paints a human side on Joseph Stalin, at least in comparison to contemporary American diplomats.<br /><br />Truman was at heart a warmonger and a racial bigot. His legacy is the loss of China and the Korean war and the expensive Truman doctrine in Turkey and Greece. On the positive side, he did institute the Marshall plan that preserved western Europe from communism.<br />We learn that MacArthur wanted to use the A-bomb in Korea.<br /><br />Eisenhower backed dictators and started the nuclear arms race. The book explores the populism of McCarthy while realizing that much more power was in the hands of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.<br /><br />Kennedy expanded the Cold War into a nuclear arms race. The book embellishes the near danger of nuclear war triggered by Cuba and the Russian submarine incident.<br /><br />We still suffer from the aftermath of the well documented LBJ era of war and Great Society.<br />S&K saythat LBJ chose the VN war over the G.S. His suppression of the anti war plank from the Democratic platform doomed Humphrey's candidacy in 1968. Later there's a poignant reminder of McNamara forlornly warning against the invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />Nixon never understood VN culture. His legacy is Kent State, My Lie, overthrow of elected governments and support of repressive regimes like Pinochet and Suharto.<br /><br />Jimmy Carter makes a great ex-president. Too bad he had to be president first. His legacy is abrogation of the presidency to Congress which failed to deal with domestic inflation or foreign problems.<br /><br />Reagan is accused of a passive management style. S&K tell a cute story of him confusing president Cleveland with the baseball pitcher whom he played in a movie. Third world debt as well as the US budget deficit ballooned, although S&K don't seem to blame Congress. Reagan continued support of dictators in Central ad S. America. He generally rebuffed the peace initiatives of Gorbachev, who knew that Star Wars could not protect the USA.<br /><br />Clinton, as president, ended  ADFC and instituted energy and financial deregulation. The authors overlook the easy money policy that set the stage for the bubbles in 2000 and 2008.<br />Russia resorted to crony capitalism during the era.<br /><br />The recent painful legacy of George Bush is well depicted, though not exactly fitting the \\"untold\\" theme.<br /><br />Despite a definite progressive bias in the rest of the book, S&K reserve their harshest criticism for the Obama administration. He has broken all of his campaign promises starting with transparency. Obama follows Bush policies, appointing a hawkish Secretary of State, and promoting continuation of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as developing drone capability and condoning resultant civilian deaths. The civil rights abuses at Guantanamo continue unabated. He tells the American people we are winding down while telling Afghans, led by his friend Hamid Karzai, that we will never leave. Obama continuously accedes to the view of his military advisors. He accelerated the war with a Bush like surge. While Obama claims the exit from Iraq as fulfilling a promise, it was negotiated by Bush. The war on drugs is as ineffectual as ever as he follows Bush domestic policy for a slow recovery. S&K point out that the slow recovery Obama domestic policies also follow the lead of the Bush administration, albeit with egalitarian motives. In general he has made an inherited mess worse.<br /><br />Five stars for a well researched, well written, informative and entertaining book, not necessarily for agreement with the point of view.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|i dont want to be a spoiler, so watch it and get mad yourself. I will still be watching the next season.
0312427999|5.0|This is a diatribe against conservative economists with the claim that they wait for a crisis to act. It consists of strident tilting at imaginary enemies, Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of economists, termed the 'Chicago Boys.' Klein's goals for government policy are redistribution of land and resources, central planning and prevention of privatization.<br />It's well researched and sporadically interesting reading. She certainly displays good knowledge of the players at the IMF and national governments. The mythical economic enemies exemplified by Milton Friedman are blamed for everything from world poverty to the torture policy of S. American dictators. She offers Orwellian economic reasons for both the Marshall Plan and division of Germany.<br /><br />The crisis theme sees to be a variation on Joseph Schumpeter's metaphor of creative destruction without mention of him. It's not only conservatives that wait for crisis mode, as the present administration has become adept at \\"kicking the can down the road.\\" It was Rahm Emanuel, in 2009, who exhorted the Obama administration to never let a good crisis go to wait. It's excessively easy to argue with a dead  straw man, who can't answer back.<br /><br />History, 1923 in Germany, USA in 1980, Bolivia in 1983 shows that shock therapy in the form of tight monetary policy can be successful in fighting inflation. Of course egalitarians don't care about inflation. When our money is worthless everyone is in the same boat.<br /><br />Without any logical arguments there's lot's of anecdotal data dating back to the LBJ administration. Her idea that we defer significant reform to a crisis situation is not limited to Klein's self concocted enemies. The free market ideology that Klein deplores is not limited to capitalist economics. It was President Clinton who advocated free trade in the 1990s including promotion of NAFTA and CAFTA.<br /><br />Like a bad movie the book switches rapidly back and forth between venues, ChinaPoland Bolivia etc. If there's a point to be made it's difficult to follow. Instead of the usual Bush bashing, this blames the \\"Chicago Boys\\" representing the Chicago School of Economics for poverty, dictatorship and torture. That war an be profitable is nothing new, but Klein finds strange blame. I'm not a proponent of unrestricted free trade but blaming that corporate favoring ideology for all the world's evils seems ridiculous.<br /><br />Klein deplores metaphors used by those she derogates. She cites \\"seeding,\\" \\"cleansing,\\" \\"uprooting\\" and \\"curing\\" used by right wing politicians. The whole book uses \\"Friedman\\" and \\"free trade\\" as metaphors for non social economic philosophy blamed for dictatorship. She claims that her own philosophy, never defined except as opposition, is \\"seeded\\" by poetry. She even uses a Nazi quote as an inadvertent metaphor for her opposition argument. Others include \\"indicator species,\\" \\"genocidal fury\\" and \\"Chicago Boys.\\" Blaming the Chicago school of economists for the \\"genocidal fury\\" of dictatorships is a bit of a stretch. Klein's own metaphors for free trade advocates include \\"piranhas\\" and \\"surgery.\\" Later we see Israeli \\"Apartheid.\\" She uses \\"corporate colonialism\\" and \\"corporate conquistadors\\" to describe corporate seizing of public assets. She correctly cites her opposition as \\"swimming against the current\\" a metaphorical activity more often right than wrong. Her excessive use of metaphors exemplifies O.W. Holmes saying \\"A good catchword can obscure analysis for fifty years.\\"<br /><br />Her take on J.M. Keynes renders her economic credentials as suspect. She even credits him with a statement about debauching currency that is usually attributed to Lenin. What she calls Keynes's warning about economic collapse breeding fascism was actually his agreement with Hayek's theme in 'The Road to Serfdom.' Keynes was a staunch opponent of the Soviet style central planning and distribution advocated by Klein. Keynes advocation of social spending was limited to recovery from recession not as a redistribution policy. In direct contravention to Klein's whole philosophy J.M. Keynes once stated \\"It's a mistake to think that businessmen are more immoral than politicians.\\" She cites J.K. Galbreath as heir to Keynes's mantle. I don't think Keynes would agree. Today his legacy has been hijacked by politicians who subscribe to Klien's message. She's also wrong on Friedman's support of the monetary shock policy of Paul Volker in combating the Carter inflation starting in 1979. William Silber, in his biography of Volker, describes how Friedman, who had Nixon's 's attention, made things difficult with his opposition.<br /><br />She places Jeffrey Sachs in same boat as Friedman. I can't think of two economists more different. There's an interesting analysis of Sach's advisory roles in Bolivia, Poland and Russia. She cites Sachs as changing from shock doctor to spokesman for the world's poor.<br /><br />The book is more about politics than economics. Similar ideas and ideology are much better expressed in 'The Untold History of the United States' by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick, a really fresh viewpoint of US foreign policy. This is ultimately a banal tirade against the obvious evils of dictatorship and torture. Progressive, as well as conservative US administrations have supported dictatorial regimes. The link to poor Milton Friedman and to free trade philosophy is obtuse at best. The double talk title is appropriate for Klein's intent to shock her readers. I'm not a die hard supporter of free trade or free market ideas. Certainly assumptions behind free trade are not always valid. Inequalities occur often. However, Klein's diatribe in favor of government central planning and egalitarian redistribution serves as a reverse argument in favor of free market capitalism.
B00479SVBU|4.0|But, the hardest part is finding an unused/unassigned radio station for it to use.  Not an issue in the boonies where I live, but even approaching a small town or city results in bleed-in from local stations.  Not the fault of the device though.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|The interplay of rich and poor, city and country, sincerity and ostentation, quickly resolves itself in a direction one can only assume is favorable. The themes are so twentieth century I feel like I'm going to church in Hollywood, and that screen writers and actors have become the new arbiters of religion, transferred into a previous era to provide a veneer of respectability. If you can get past all this, the setting is cute, the dramas are sweet, and the characters are lovable. Apparently my wife can quite easily get past &#34;all this!&#34;

All my Sharks are maxed out, but I'm still 3100 gold away from purchasing the Great White... and I never had to purchase anything. So it's pretty well balanced and not outrageous. You can usually average 2-3K gold per round with a fully maxed out shark. I'm guessing it may take a good month once obtaining the Great White to get it maxed out, including being able to buy the laser.<br /><br />It's not the funnest game I ever played, but it is entertaining and a little challenging. I still let out a laugh eating humans. That may never get old.<br /><br />Now, if they made a multiplayer version of the game, that would be awesome.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|&#34;A Memory of Light&#34; is an amazing finish to a journey we've all been following for years. Brandon Sanderson does a fantastic job tying together all the strands of fate woven by Robert Jordan's legacy. Staying true to the spirit of the story and the characters, Sanderson manages to draw things to a satisfying conclusion; leaving room for more story to be explored, yet ensuring that nothing feels unfinished. My only regret about this book is that I didn't pick it up sooner. I highly recommend &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; to all who have followed the Wheel of Time thus far; you won't be disappointed.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was worried this wouldn't work because I didn't have the wall piece for the Kindle, but I've been using one of my iPhone wall plugins and it works amazing. My old phone charger was really messing with my Kindle's battery and I needed a cheap cord for the Kindle. Charges fast and is really long! Works great, I have no complaints after owning this for a month or so.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like the pictures and each additional stories with each category. It pleasing to the eye and the subject matter and the wonderful pictures are exciting. Its nice to read and look at the pictures and ideas.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I spend a lot of time playing games on my kindle fire. This is cute and entertaining. I wish you had easier ways to gain Gru points but otherwise I enjoy it!
B0086700CM|2.0|OMG. I thought this was going to be fun. But I killed the guy right off the bat. I am not video game fast. So I do not find this too great. My granddaughter only got so far many times too.  I will give it a try a little longer.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|It was a good rendition of the story, using real people, but keeping true to the story line. Enjoyed evry minute of the movie.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|the plot was thin and outrageous but what else do you expect from a bang bang shoot em up with Bruce Willis It was exactly what I like to see in this type of movie a few car chases lots of explosions. If you like the diehard series you will love this.
0810989956|5.0|My daughter love it.she love all the questions and the way you could make your own diary at the end
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|If I want culture I take the wife out to the met If I want educational I watch Stephen Hawking on PBS If I want to see explosions and car chases I watch a Bruce Willis movie. This did not disappoint.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this series. I was always wanted to watch the next episode. Bought the whole series this season. I can't wait for Season THREE.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Bought this game because I was bored and the reviews were great. I am truly addicted. My kids love to watch me play. The only reason it isn't a five star game is because it left a lot for me to figure out on my own. Including learning the hard way that the coins are pretty hard to come by unless you buy them with real money. Over all though really fun.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|As long as I will be able to save the pics....i am happy.<br />The app is easy to use...good step by step other than knowing where the pics will be saved to.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Truly, a light bulb came on for me. My marriage isn't in trouble, in fact I'd say we are above average, but every marriage can use improvement and I think this book was really useful in providing ways to deepen our relationship.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|The first Marilyn was strangely capturing, in spite of, the way she was packaged and how she packaged herself. Never has someone so phony, contrived, in spite of herself, still come across as so very real.<br />Michelle Williams, in this film, brings all this about Marilyn to life again.<br />After this one I have promised myself never to miss another of her performances ever again.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|After waiting so long for the next Mr. Hosseini book, I have to say I am so disappointed in this story. Did not reach my heart as the others did and the storyline covered too many characters, timeframes and locations. Too bad for such a 'splendid' author.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|great movie to watch with your girlfriends, fun, sexy, love story, comedic. Good times movie! I would recommend it, I wish it had more features on the extras
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characters are great. They make you interested in what is going on.  The chemistry between characters is very fluid.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I edited a few pictures on my S4, but when I was done, I hit save, then choose a quality, and then nothing.  It doesn't save anywhere.  There's an icon acting like it's saving but nothing ever happens.  Uninstalled.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|An exciting movie..and to see how he admitted that he  had a drinking problem, brought it too another level.I could have watched it go longer and I love the bounding with his son
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased this kit right as I was leaving on an international trip. It was easy to figure out and quickly got my pictures from my camera to my iPad so that I could post to Facebook in my limited amount of unscheduled time.
B000001FDK|5.0|Item arrived quickly and is of good quality.  Have used it numerous times for my daughter's talent festivals and has performed flawlessly.
B0047DVHV2|4.0|Very enjoyable.  A shocking, revealing laugh at Keith's life that makes the reader want to kick up his heals more than he currently does
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I got this book to try to better understand my girlfriend who is a self proclaimed introvert (I would be the extrovert).  This book had several great insights into both introversion and extroversion, and I even found that I am probably less of an extrovert than I thought.  There were some very interesting stories and tips and anecdotes, both about relationships and also has some great tips for teachers and business people.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Plays everything so far. Decent controls. Used on Nabi Jr. And rooted Nook Color. Worth the download  to use it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has been fun to play. From the interesting levels to the cars, this game was designed to keep someone engaged. The moon level is especially amusing with reduced gravity. GREAT JOB with this. Just wish there were more levels and cars.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay the third and final book in the hunger games trilogy felt like a repeat of the first and second books with an expected variation at the end. It was worth the read to finish up the story but wanted more meat and broader character arcs.
B0035XQW74|5.0|I usually fall asleep for movies! This holds your attention!  I wasn't expecting the ending! It is a must see!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked the game and very addictive but it just needs more levels because I finished it too quick...add more levels please
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the most endearing and poignant films ever! Incredible cast, beautiful stories,and a heart warming message! Definitely a win!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. It will keep any one busy for hours on end. Graphics are amazing too.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Enjoyed this one way may than the first! Loved all the new additions, action, and plot. The ninjas are so bad too!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|When all you need is a simple calculator, this is it.  Big display, large keys, and simple layout.  The only needed to make it perfect is a running display tape so you can see all your entries.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found the book reasonably oddly constructed.  I read the author's notes on the construction after I finished it and was not swayed.  I found it peculiar.<br /><br />The story is well crafted otherwise, the narrative reasonable, the characters neither black nor white, humanly grey.<br /><br />In short, a trip to the library would have saved me the cost; perhaps this will lead me to learn how to return an e-book honestly (I'm certainly not going to claim I didn't get it, lost my iPad, or hated it so much I want my money back).
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Brian K Vaughan is back in top form, wiring \\"Y:tLM\\" level fantasy again. This book is engaging and addicting . The art is refreshing-after years of hideous comics pencils and colors in top titles, Saga goes the other direction, thankfully. Art, inking, and color palette are all gorgeous. Recommended.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|If you need a good laugh this is the movie to see. No dull parts in this hilariously funny movie.
B009178OQA|5.0|A great portrait of a true master and the costs of attaining that level of excellence.  I highly recommend it.
B00ALGW286|5.0|This is a story about Marina, a highly intelligent, ambitious Foreteen years old girl, who lives in Moscow. She is driven to learn English and prepare for her college exams, which are two years away, as a way of shaping her future. Her dream is to travel and see the world.<br /><br />The author, Julia Gousseva, sweeps us away into a different time and place, unfamiliar to most of us. She brings us into Marina's home, allows us to take snapshots of her family, feel the change of seasons going into a cold Russian winter, and hear her father's stories as he comes back home from his travels. We smell the aroma of Russian foods, such as modlovnik, as they are prepared by her Babushka (grandmother.)<br /><br />The descriptions are utterly honest, drawn faithfully and in precise, authentic detail, all of which builds our trust in the writing. Through the observant eyes of this sharp-minded girl, we become witnesses to an increasingly turbulent time of change: the Perestroika period, which restructured the Soviet political and economic system, and caused of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, during 1991-1992.<br /><br />I love the double twisted yarn where &#34;life around Marina was changing, and she was changing too.&#34; How would she cope with these changes, in herself and in her country, which are beyond her anything she has imagined before?<br /><br />What a fascinating read! Five stars.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|This is a great movie, but definitely not one for the family. Parents beware! Sit back, Relax, and Enjoy this flick.
B00E5BQ9SW|1.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong with rating a product based on it's value and the price it's being sold at. This is NOT worth $100 bucks. I agree with the other poster. These 'limited edition' 3000 copy schemes are BS.<br /><br />I'll skip this, or wait until they eventually release it at a normal volume and price. No Blu-Ray is worth this much.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it drew me out of myself and gave me realistic ideas to 're-start my creativity and get more organized as an artist. It was a very short book and an easy read. So it didn't take long to access all the great information. Kiddos to Austin Klein.<br />Mhlivingston
B00BWJARHO|3.0|for a movie that took ten years to get made, am I missing something, like the other half of the movie?
B004SIP7PS|5.0|This is a charming story<br />I really enjoyed it<br />I am happy that I bought it and will watch it again
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|i know movies can only be remade so many different ways but this caught me off guard a few times.. with irony and wit
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is perfect for everyone it's fun like temple run but simpler. I LOVE IT. It's great for playing on your break or playing all night long to beat your friends and family.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|i didn't want to say i was surprised by the ending because i thought i could predict it. then i did. but i still got a surprise.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The story line was good, I really hated the situation with her dad and the whole gambling part of the book! Could of done without that part but besides that the book was good.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|id say it was an old classic, but its more than that. a whole generation or two missed out on this. the current style of movie barely compare to the comedy and effort that found in this.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A lot of people after here about suicide do go crazy wanting to know how and why. Mostly the why. This book is tapping into something not many would care to look into. A beautifully written and life changing story. Well done
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked shades of gray you'll like this series. It's very similar without the BDSM aspect. I absolutely could not put it down. And I have never been a big reader.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I wish you had more hearts and peanuts to start of using . Not a bad game at all needs more peanut and hearts
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I'm a huge G.I. Joe fan and this movie just is a huge disgrace. Do not waste your time or money on this movie!! That's just my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very addicting game. For kids and adults I am a adult and I am addicted to this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. There's a whole room to explore and you find different objects or clues that help you to solve various puzzles in the room and, ultimately, open the elevator door to go to the next room. Some of the puzzles can be a bit confusing, but all in all it's a lot of fun.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|If you've ever seen an episode and liked the cleverness of the plot and overall idea, you'll really enjoy these DVDs. Season Two includes some extras, which are pretty interesting. It helps if you see Season One first, particularly if you don't recall or never saw the show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games that make you think.. and this one kept me on my toes... I only wish it had more levels, I was done in a day or so
B00000J2PH|5.0|When Carole King began her music career, it was writing songs for other artists.  Her hard-scrabble voice was probably why she didn't record her wonderful songs in the beginning. Thank goodness some one (James Taylor perhaps?) convinced her to record her own wonderful works. I love her voice, her passion and how very timeless her songs are. I watched her receive the Gershwin Award at the White House. All that passion is still there. Keep on moving the earth under out feet, Carole.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this stupid game, although some of its goals make you have to play longer periods of time than i would prefer.. but wheres the challenge in that, right?
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Nice find the objects game....it's pretty easy even for novices, so if you like find the objects with a purpose this is a game for you
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it.<br /><br />It gives me abilities to use my power to use my vocabulary everywhere.<br />To help me learn.<br /><br />To my family.and friends
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I loved this movie.  George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and does an exceptional job in this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|temple run style game, a lot of fun. my son could play it for hours. the only problem we have is that it takes a long time to load.
B007N85POS|5.0|Angry birds is addictive.  I didn't think this version was as hard as some of the other versions I have tried.
0671449028|5.0|I read this book to my boys 26 years ago and the book fell apart for the hundreds of times we read it together. I have looked for a reprinting and recently discovered the Good Night Good Night book was released with a new name, The Going to Bed Book. I ordered three so all my grand kids can enjoy it as their fathers did.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I'm not sure young people would like this movie but it was very moving for me.  I can understand how elderly people are looking for something in their later years.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Dr Aslan's depiction of the Temple during the reign of Herod the Great is so vivid that it catapulted me through the entire book. You need not be a theologian (I certainly am not), a Christian, or a skeptic to be engrossed in this book. If you are interested in history, politics, western civilization, society...if you're at all mindful of the world in which you live and the people who inhabit it, you'll likely find this book worth your time.
0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber brings to light the things that can go wrong with the start-up of small business. This book should be required reading for anyone attempting to strike out on his/her own!!!!
B00EI6E17A|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this song - and at the first play, I really did. But after subsequent listens, it gets really old. I'd save your money...or at least wait until ARTPOP is released. You'll hear this track plenty on the radio that you'll get your fill of it.<br /><br />Also, this is a personal note of mine, and I understand that it leaking is what caused it's early release, BUT it still was a shoddy move on Gaga's part to release it the same day as Katy Perry. It looked like a desperate attempt to steal some thunder. #justsayin
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|The book was alright, I think that the beginning could have been more interesting. I found my self getting confused. But the end was great!
B004EPYZTE|3.0|OK, so Jason Momoa does a decent job in his role as a younger Conan, and the casting is decent, but this film just does not carry a lot of depth. The story is standard Conan fare and it hints at events from Howards books, but just really never commits. I own it in 3D and it was done well and is one of those movies I like to have on while doing stuff around the house or during my bike ride in the basement. It neither excels nor dissapoints enough to just be a decent film that entertains, and while not blowing to the tops of the charts, is better than many that have come before and I am sure will follow after.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Saw a clip for upcoming seasons and decided it looked good so I watched  the pilot and got hooked, cannot stop watching , its like that really good book you just can't put down
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I've been a fan of Final Fantasy (6-9), .hack (original & GU), Persona 3 Portable, and many other odd RPG series.<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden takes all the neat things about P3P and gives them a level of polish and shine oozing with style and easy-to-understand complexity.<br /><br />My favorite improvement by far has been the network features, SOS battle help and asking what other players did with their free time.<br /><br />The TV Overlay stuff is really awesome too.<br /><br />The characters, the battles, a fantastic \\"very easy\\" mode (you can unlock a \\"very hard\\" mode for New Game+ if you like to suffer), and an engaging story all culminate in one of the best games I've ever played.<br /><br />All that wrapped up in a portable package that lets you can chip away the content - it's a must-have for any RPG fan or Vita owner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a fun app. so fun &amp; realistic for my daughter. she loves to pet &amp; feed &amp; increase in levels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|coolest game. Everyone who likes horses you need this app! Such an awesome app to own. Doesn't everyone want a horse of there own I know I do!
0615782043|4.0|How can you not be a little bit trepidatious when you pick up a work by someone calling themselves the greatest anything?<br /><br />I'm happy to say that G.P.A. does not disappoint-- and, more importantly, as his poems bear out, it's all in good fun.  Here is a collection of 30 or so poems based on the poet's real life encounters with a variety of women in Chicago. Phone sex, IM sex, public sex, stripteases, adultery, BDSM, asphyxiation-- in this slender volume of verse, G.P.A. manages to cover an impressive range of sexual experiences.<br /><br />A friend of mine remarked to me once, \\"Sex is grown-up play.\\"  I think G.P.A. would certainly agree, and these poems struck exactly the right note for me, balancing between playful and titillating, funny and serious, but always, always decadent.<br /><br />I love how he focused, with the attention expected of a lover, on the details of his ladies' appearance.  He notes their clothing labels and fabrics, their manicures, their perfume.  He also notes their tattoos, the hue of their skin, their wetness.  He focuses on their imperfections as much as their beauty-- one lover is a zaftig beauty, whose generous backside nearly swallows her G-string.  Another wears blue contacts to change the shade of her eyes.  They are all objects of wonder to G.P.A., worlds to uncover.  And G.P.A explores with such exuberance, it's hard not to be caught up in his enthusiasm-- which, of course, is what one wants in a partner.<br /><br />Food and drink appear, as prandial pleasures complement sexual ones.  The poems themselves employ a great deal of alliteration, inviting the reader to read them aloud, to share them, to experience the sensation of the words on their tongues.  (As he himself observes in the poem, Pictures, \\"Pleasure mounts with the sharing.)  A full sensory experience.<br /><br />I also love the straightforward, narrative style of the poems.  Very directly, G.P.A. makes his declarations:<br /><br />\\"I am obsessed with you.\\"<br /><br />\\"We are urging each other towards cataclysmic climax.\\"<br /><br />\\"How exhilarating it is to be watched.\\"<br /><br />Very little room for interpretation there, but sometimes, that's okay.  I also like how he changes up styles-- some poems are long, a haiku, a sextet.<br /><br />For all G.P.A.'s metrosexual tendencies, these poems are thoroughly, red-bloodedly male.<br /><br />In the Obsession poem, he writes, \\"It is supposed to make you feel a tad frightened.\\"  Lines like that just make me feel more female, and as such, more vulnerable.  I'm sure a great deal of that is culturally ingrained, but-- here we are.  Which is not to say that G.P.A. isn't afraid to play around with gender roles-- in one poem, he is the one doing the striptease.  I suppose it's that very willingness to play around that makes these poems so attractive, even to a bitter feminist like me.  Also, it's hard not to appreciate a man who so clearly reveres women.<br /><br />I think my favorite poem in the whole collection was, \\"Comfortable,\\" in which he observes a woman who removes her bra while driving.  He makes the act of observing her in that moment something that goes beyond intimacy-- so great is her comfort with him, she can do something like that while he watches.<br /><br />My criticisms are very few-- in many of the poems, he changes the font for no discernible reason.  The words speak for themselves, I see no reason to resort to trick formatting to get your point across.  I didn't care to flip through pages of reviews at the beginning.  There's both a foreword and an afterword, which seemed unnecessary for such a short collection.  But these are just minor complaints, and really didn't detract from my overall and thorough enjoyment.<br /><br />So if you're in the mood, or if you want to get in the mood, pick up a copy of Revenge of the Orgasm.  Male or female, as long as you're hetero, you will be satisfied.
B00406O7YK|5.0|Watch this movie years ago, loved it then and when you offered it on prime knew I had to watch it again.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I love all Jane Austen's films. Some variations are better than others and I liked this one better than the other one. I always get my merchandise promptly when ordering from Amazon.com, thanks a lot. MJ
0684857219|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it. He has learned a lot about proper form and technique and the why's and how's.  Arnold is the man.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I let my daughter download this game onto my kindle because she played it at her friend house and loved it. Well I let her play it unsupervised and found that she had bought a bunch of coins and keys and things which were charged to my account. Now I have to find some way to get a refund because the keys cost me 20 bucks for some stupid thing in a game. Its not like I spent 20 bucks on food that I could put in my fridge you know something real that you can hold in your hand! and then 99 cents for each of the coins she bought. So I'm really mad about this. Thanks for the imaginary items for your dumb game.
0307719774|2.0|When I bought this I didn't realize it was the same 365 questions that repeat for 5 years. My fault for not properly reading the description.
B00821OX98|5.0|It makes one think of the past and the future.  How would you respond when given the philosophical reason for the invasion.  How far would you go to defend your home.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I love this show. Well...used to. I'm about half way through the first season. It started out being really interesting but now I'm getting annoyed because there is so much christianity being brought in to it and I don't care to watch anything about that. I understand it's part of viking history but seeing as the christians in real life destroyed so much evidence of viking culture I can't really stand to watch it. I want to see vikings. Not christians.
B008602KQI|4.0|This amped up version of the underdog winning in the end, with good triumphing over evil, is an edge of your seat type of movie. There is the requisite sadness, the reluctant hero, the seemingly bumbling love interest, and a cast that pulls it off. Jennifer Lawrence is great in her role as Katniss, who learns that  &#34;playing the game&#34;, isn't just about shooting straight, but navigating the emotional and political paths as well.<br />It is a dark film, with no specific memorable catch lines uttered by the heroine.<br />There is one line that the producers of these hunger games use, however, that sticks with you...&#34;May the odds be always in your favor&#34;.<br />Absolutely with the watch.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Stophie Kinsella is one of my favourite authors for her humour.  There is plenty in this book that made me laugh out loud.  :D
1401938906|5.0|Get ready to rock your world!  Pamela Grout delivers a life changing book; the best Law of Attraction book I have ever read.  The experiments are fun and it is a book that I have read over and over.  Each time a get something different from it.  It is worth every penny and then some.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another great read from Lee Child.  Looking forward to Jack Reacher 18 coming out at the end of this month!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Cool app.  Kills time.  And, well, it's Angry Birds.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds. [Space filler since more words were required]
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|still have not used it quite that often, but plan on using it more in the near future and all.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I liked all the characters, it was suprisingly fun and not cartoony. ScarJo, my oh my. The Captain America prequil was good too. Thanks amazon prime for free video
B006GWO5NE|5.0|love it. really works. the first one died on me and had to replace it. suggest you all get one, cuz it doesn't take long for it to recharge.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a show you can watch over and over and see something new every time you watch it.  I would like to see more episodes in the upcoming seasons
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|I bought this album because \\"Deleted Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor\\" has been one of my favorite albums since I first heard of Caro Emerald a couple of years ago. I couldn't wait to hear everything on this new album because the previous one was so good. With the first listen, I was a little disappointed but I did not give up. I liked every song but it wasn't everything I had hoped it would be. After giving it a few more listens, it has grown on me and I now love every song on this album too. This is a great album and I know I'll be listening to it on repeat for a some time to come.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was a solid OK.  Interesting take on the media's obsession with wife murdering husbands and the wives they murder.  Worth a read but don't expect any great insights.  The author kept injecting humor in odd ways - almost like he couldn't decide if the book was a mystery or humorous or ???
B000FC13E0|5.0|A little short, but I liked it. Being a programmer, I found the code samples in the book to be a little silly, but overall the science was not completely implausible like some others. If you care about that sort of thing.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love zombies.  I love love stories.  You get both in this movie -- plus some good gore.  Watch it!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Another great fantasy movie that leaves you wanting more. Expect great special effects and fantastical amusing creative creatures and characters. I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was OK and I tried to read it to my 9 year old because I found it to be like Narnia but he was lost by the third chapter.  I gave up and chalked it up to an OK summer read for me.
