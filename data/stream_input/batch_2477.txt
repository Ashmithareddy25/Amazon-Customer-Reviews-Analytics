B000W1TJWC|5.0|One of Rush's Best albums<br />This was the start of a great series<br />of albums that defined a decade of drumming<br />on the dash board while you listened to some<br />of the best music created in the last 30 years.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I'm a fan of Rihanna's music - not so much her personal life but regardless this is a great buy : a hard copy and digital copy
B008J34466|5.0|I had been looking for a good Musical CD and this one had a few that I liked of Pink's songs on it so I am far from disappointed.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The king of pop does it again, and boy does he do it with style. This is a great buy : a hard copy and digital copy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Love it, but really hard! Almost all of my friends play it and those  who don't wish they did.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not much to say other than it is written well, just like all the others . however not the conclusion I expected or wanted. The story line was pretty dull for a series finale, and in comparison to the other books there wasn't much excitement at all. I'd say it's a good toilet read. I couldn't put the other books down but with this one I just read it when trying to pass time.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries work great!  We are happy with the quality and the price we paid for them.  And ordering is so simple; no hassles at the check-out counters.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|When I first goty full Harry Potter set  the first thing I did was open it to watch them. Unfortunately when I opened the DVD case I found that the plastic pieces that holds the pieces the DVDs are on completely shattered. I do not if it broke in transit or was shipped that way. Thankfully none of the DVDs were scratched or damaged, but I do have to be careful when opening the case so that they don't all fall out.
1451627289|5.0|First of all, kudos to Stephen King.  I dedicated all of two weeks in reading this captivating and suspenseful time-travel of a story.  And not was I disappointed.  I don't read many of these type of stories, but when Stephen King takes on time-travel and history, I pretty much trust with my gut he's going to deliver, which he has.  Within the mist of the chaos of trying to save one of America's historical people of that time period, there is also a beautiful and yet challenging romance between George Amberson/Jake Eppings and Sadie Dunhill.  For those who are future writers of any genre, who likes to add romance to their stories, Stephen King shows you how a great one should be written.  Sadie is my absolute favorite character from the moment she enters the story to the end.  She made laugh, cry, and root for her.  As for the story, in general, if you like a good food-for-thought thriller that will keep you on your toes I'd say read this.  Even if you don't read much Stephen King.  Even if you don't know much about JFK and his politics.  This book incredibly entertaining if nothing else.  I had a blast reading 11/22/63 and Stephen King truly applies all his creative magic to this story making it one of  his most splendid pieces of work he's ever done.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I would not call this a straight up horror movie, it's so much more than then that, more like a very dark fairy tale. I don't watch a lot of movies because most don't even interest me in the least bit, but I wanted to watch Mama when it first came out on the big screen , I didn't get to and when I finally seen it available on my Kindle I did not hesitate to rent it.<br />I love the story of who Mama was and how she became this horrific spectre that becomes \\"mama\\" to two helpless little girls left in an old cabin in the woods.<br />Mama is horrifying to behold , full of anger and intense sorrow , but as the story unfolded I could help but feel for \\"mama\\". I felt the character of Mama was full of pathos, thus much more than some common generic slasher ghoul that's offered up in 95 percent of so called horror movies of our time.<br />This movie for me had some real disturbing images , a couple moments in the film made my skin crawl , the last good movie that did that was The Ring , at least for me. In fact I think \\"mama\\" could take on The Rings' Samara anytime!<br />I love this movie.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I grieved, mourned and truly longed for additonal episodes and a different ending. These people became part of my life and I miss it.  This was a spiritual, wonderful ending to a wonderful journey.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Lots of great effects. $2 is a bit much for such a short game. I solved this in a short amount of time. I was thinking the challenges would continue and more levels would appear but it ended after 3 levels. Bummer. However, I do not regret my purchase.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|What can be said about this album , It feels upbeat, energetic and amazing to lsiten to alone or with friends. To me it feels like Patrick Stump made a second album and its Literally Patrick Stump and Fall out Boy which Im glad to hear and listen to as he is a great singer. This album is worth the buy and you should def jump on it. If you ever heard the term \\"Dance like no one is watching\\" This ablum will make you do that in spades lol
B004R13U6Y|4.0|It did the things I want and so I never test others parts.  But I found that the button are not very intuitive.
B005SLS3VY|5.0|I really loved this book  as Michael Connolly writes a good one all the time.I do not think I have ever read a bad one.he really fleshes a story out and the characters, some with flaws,very realistic.
0553801473|4.0|I've read all 5 of the existing books and just feel frustrated. I figure I've read about 3000 pages and just feel a great lack of closure. Worse I feel that this story could go on for ever.<br />Don't get me wrong I liked the books but I just feel frustrated and more importantly cheated. I feel that the whole story is beginning to seriously drag and was possibly designed that way just to make money. Especially since the author seems to be struggling to complete the work. Likened to J.R.R. Tolkein, an American version is flattering but Tokein finished his work.
1936891026|5.0|Fiction writer Steven Pressfeild applies his experiences of procrastination and other negative mental battles into categories. He simplifies and breaks down each source of \\"resistance\\". Very easy to read, subjects are limited to only a couple pages (usually just one page). His history of fiction writing shines in his analogies and connection to the reader. (to clarify, this book is not fiction)
B00CKQ1092|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album.  Well worth the wait and can't wait to see them on tour.  Get this album!
0547884591|5.0|Beautiful book, easy to read, addictive and interactive. Tim Ferriss is such a lovable protagonist, his intentions are pure, his achievement is monumental, and his modesty is astounding. Life Nerd
B000W7JWUA|3.0|I was introduced to this game in the fall of 2012. After playing a few times I was hooked. Before buying my own set, the person that introduced me to it said it was good that I'd be getting the &#34;new&#34; one as the &#34;older&#34; ones had problems with the board pieces staying locked together.<br /><br />Well, they still can't get that part right. I would have expected that after having made this game for years, and for the price it costs, Mayfair would have been able to figure out how to get the board pieces to not warp and stay locked together. What I found was board pieces that are quite thin, a large majority of pieces that just won't stay flat, and a board that STILL will not stay solidly locked together.<br /><br />This is a great game that is still plagued by a poorly made board. Look around the board game universe, Mayfair, and have other companies who have long since figured out how to avoid this problem teach you how to make a game board!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this show. The video was very good quality and we have no complaints. Can't wait until the next season starts!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|The Maze Runner had me hooked & I wanted more.  I bought each book in the series & they didn't disappoint, including The Kill Order.  Well written & interesting, each page leaves you wondering what will happen next.  This book answers some of the questions regarding the Flare- who? why?  If you liked The Maze Runner, buy the whole set.  Other series you'd probably enjoy: Divergent, Hunger Games, The Knife of Never Letting Go (strange title, great read).
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Plenty of fiction but not enough reality to tie it all together. I found myself bored with the story line and feeling as though I was reading stranger version of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. A bit of a children's book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob kept my interest until the surprise ending.  It offered some concepts in genetics that I was unaware of.  William Landay's character came alive.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Cloud Atlas is not for everyone. Its use of multiple stories in different time periods to make a sociological statement is obviously in the experimental stage. This concept is not completely new, Shakespeare invented the concept of telling one story that could be understood by all people's from different sociological backgrounds and Shakespeare is considered by many to be the greatest literary writer of all time. Like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, this film tries to break ground in movie making. Only time will tell if it gets better with age or simply becomes a cult classic.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Good product that improved charging time and convenience. This cable is high quality and fits perfectly. I only wish it would fit both ways and could transfer data.
B001RTSPVY|3.0|I don't have much time to watch these shows and my son said this i should watch.<br />I probably will not complete watching it until maybe 6 months to a year.<br />So far, ok. not something i would normally watch but ok.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am so glad Sanderson agreed to complete this epic story, he did a masterful job.  Every thread is followed to weave an unforgettable ending to one of the best fantasy tales of all time.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I don't have much time to watch these shows and my son said this i should watch.<br />I probably will not complete watching it until maybe 6 months to a year.<br />So far, ok. not something i would normally watch but ok.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is much like all the Angry Bird games.  Not much difference.  I do like that there are multiples of birds more often.  It works for a free game.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|A funny, witty and entertaining show with quite a few levels, not a CSI type serious but that's what makes it fun to watch. Casting is on the button, and the story lines creative, keeps you interested and looking for more.
B008BM9L72|5.0|A very good read how some one can change and all for the better and it is a really nice love story
B004I11VZA|5.0|I loved this 2nd movie and also the original IP Man movie! This one was a very good sequel and since it's based on a TRUE STORY I absolutely loved all of them!!
B004S699K4|5.0|Thanks for the great item! Played perfectly.<br />I've loved this movie since I was a kid. (weird, I know)<br /><br />Thanks Again
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game, a little short, but definitely worthwhile. Challenging enough to keep me thinking but not so hard I felt stupid lol. Looking forward to the next chapter!!
B005NJU8PA|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, because I liked the first two books of his.  This one, however, was terrible.<br /><br />I like the concept - &#34;with these basic ingredients on hand, just add A B or C for a great dish&#34;, but it didn't take a whole book to do it.  It was repetitive, and it made me say outloud, &#34;are you kidding me?&#34;<br /><br />No way would this book EVER have been published were it not for the success of his first books on work and fitness<br /><br />I doubt there will be -- I hope there won't be -- another book in this series.
B007N85POS|4.0|Entertaining  Keeps me entertained when I am sitting in a office for an appointment. I hate having to use a specific amount of words. I won't be doing reviews.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I think that Peter Jackson has a great grasp of the world of Middle Earth and is able to share that vision with those around him in a way few others could.  I watched this with some who loved what they remembered of the Lord of Rings movies but not huge mega fans, and I’m not  a fanatic myself, but I did love the movie.  I thought the pacing was good for the scenes that were in here.  At first I was on the fence when I heard there was extra in here, the book was my favorite of the four because the most action happened in it and I was afraid it was going to feel over drawn.  After seeing it I welcomed the addition of additional story that wasn’t in the book but fits the time frame.  The pace was that of a regular life ticking along at the pace it had always known but change was blowing in, and when adventure comes knocking you would be a fool to turn it away.  The film looked good and I am looking forward to watching it again though I am very likely to have it on in the background since I,  unlike our little hobbit friend, do not have that much free time to watch it all again.  Though I do look forward to 2 and 3 when they come out.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|This album brutally tickles my ear drums with its fanciful, delicate vocal delivery. Its delightfully, bone-shattering guitar wails and hollers will get you convulsing beautifully on the floor. The drums. OH MY, THE DRUMS. The drumming is so unbelievable, that you'll feel it in your nether regions. And the bass tone and delivery is everything you'd expect from Liam Wilson. Hairy, dancey and amazingly butter smooth. If your finger hasn't already clicked the purchase button by now, then you should certainly do so right now. You'll go places you've never been before and soar on the highest of highs with bald, geometric eagles!
B005LAII3A|3.0|The action is fast and pretty in a way that today’s graphics and animation can bring to life but did they breathe life into something that needed it?  Not as much as I was hoping.  The girls are prettier, the guy is bit more believable than Arnie (though LOVE him) as a common Joe that turns out to be something more.  But nothing new was added that the first didn’t do in all of its cheesy glory.  If you like action movies, Phillip K Dick stories or pretty girls in tight stuff then watch it for sure, but if you loved the first and want to see something that felt like it did the first time around, meh.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|This is a great game.  Highly recommend.  Lots of free tokens and great chances to win.  Will recommend to my friends.
B005LAII8A|5.0|HA, Boom baby!  I am so bad as seeing how things are going to end that by the time this one came around to doing what it did, I was invested.  I liked the ride and since I knew no spoilers it was fun to watch it all go down.  The action is enough to keep it afloat, the bad guy isn’t seen just his lackey and he is well done and comes across worse than the protagonist which isn’t a good guy in his own right.
B0030B621W|4.0|Kinda wish more of &#34;how did this come to be&#34; had been explored, but this is an entertaining rental.  Very solid acting by both Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. The editing was a bit annoying but it was entertaining and much better than the Twilight no acting movies that were hard to sit through .
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|You need to see this movie because the chemisty in it is amazing and the characters are funny as hell.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I loved this book! Although the story was fiction, it's portrayed in a way to make it seem totally plausible. I would love to see this become a movie!
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|After reading the books, then seeing this movie I am at a loss how it even made it past the authors. WTF
B008N1V11U|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this seeing as it was an app and it was only .99 cents but once I started playing it I was amazed on the quality and of how fun it really was. The gliding and rapeling ( not sure of its spelling kinda early) is a little clunky but driving the bat pod and the bat and free roaming in 2 different cities as batman while fighting crime is tons of fun.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Ok the movie is not what one would call PC. But neither was the time leading up to the civil war... that's why there was a civil war...<br /><br />The acting is fantastic, the characters engaging, and Quintin's direction is as usual spot on. This was a great story to wrap you up in for a evening.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My toddler loves seeing the fishes, she laughs at the whale bit. She would start crying when I tried the simon train videos, but she is happy watching nemo fishy for 10-20 min in a sitting (all I need to get a breather!)
B00597A6NU|5.0|This movie was very good. I always enjoy the WWII movies, &#34;The greatest generation&#34;. The color and sound were excellent.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is my favorite book of all times. It's mysterious, very exciting, and impossible to put down. A fantastic read!
B003TJ4YU6|1.0|It is not true that these shows are \\"complete\\". The original versions, which you can watch at the Paley Center for Media, in New York, (at least that I know), include the very important section of Mr. Sullivan talking to Topo Gigio. It might seem ridiculous today, but that's how it was in television those days.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I Loved it! It was very intense. Love jax and tara together! I cannot wait to start the next season!
B005OT2YVA|3.0|If you're up for action  and some nice CG effects that are not full of gore, this movie is the one for you. If you are looking for a movie that has a solid plot, good character development, or even a story that makes sense, leave this one behind.<br /><br />I enjoyed the action but I found that there were often gaping holes in the story. Eventually, I just totally turned off my &#34;reality meter&#34; and enjoyed the explosions, fights, and curves (yes, if you are a male of the species, you can't help but notice).<br /><br />Not a great way but also not a bad way to spend two hours of one's life. Watch it if you like sci-fi action. Don't watch it if you don't.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|I never watch any shows on the CW, however after seeing previews for this before it started, I figured I would give it a try.  I am glad I did, it was a very good show.  Good acting, action, and character development over the first season.  I highly recommend this show.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|The writing is scattered - does not follow very well. Also some ideas have certainly been borrowed from other books/authors.<br />Maybe this problem has something to do with the translation or maybe just because this is his first book. Because others are better written.
052118939X|5.0|Received the book as displayed, brand new and in time.<br />Surely suggest a must buy for English Language learners.<br />It is worth spnding on it.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app is wonderful do not believe the bad reviews of this app!! it works good on the kindle fire and I haven't had any problems with ads popping up! I totally recommend getting this app for your. device!
1446249182|5.0|I received my book within 2 days of my order. I am very happy with my purchase. The book is ineresting to read, especially since I have never had to use a statistics program.
B002PZC8BM|3.0|I liked &#34;The Guardian&#34; with Simon Baker,  but I didn't think &#34;The Mentalist&#34; was as good.  It was to predictable.  At the very first scene, where the wife shot her husband for molesting their daughter, I thought, boy this going to be good but it went down hill from there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was excellent.  It depicts a family dealing with mental illness in a very real way.  An enjoyable read!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|SOOO happy I can FB on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9! Keeping in touch with friends and family daily is important to me.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I really love my Marware Revolve Standing Case for my Kindle.  Having the ability to stand my Kindle in portrait or landscape has been wonderful.  I am an avid reader who had not considered buying an e-reader until just recently.  I bought my Kindle so that I could take books with me without the extra weight of a book.  Having the ability to put it in portrait view has definitely made the transition very satisfying.  The strap on the back makes it very easy to read without needing to \\"grasp\\" it.  The Mareware Revolve allows me to read for longer periods of time without the hand fatigue of holding on to something or stand my Kindle up and continue to read as if I had a \\"real\\" book in my hands.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|its a great game for 13 plus.  and in order to play nonlinear multiplayer you must have a gameloft account
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very very good book that is more than it seems. At first glance it is a sci-fi book about a kid training to be a soldier but it was written in the mid 80's and it quietly has a bit to say about world politics.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Although this item is not incredibly bright, in my opinion the 25 hour battery life counters it. for a small compact light like a AA maglite, I'm not trying to light up a football field, but using the light for a short range purpose like looking for something or looking at something in a dark hard to reach place. the beam of the led conversion also has a massive diameter which is very helpful for short range purpose. even the other 140 lumen led replacement only has a 4 hour battery life which isnt that great. if im in a situation where i need a bright light that can go distance, i have multiple full size flashlights for that. this light conversion is better than the factory light and much more efficient for an emergency situation. overall not bad for the price, and useful light for small utility purposes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had disregarded the Hunger Games books (and film) as fodder for tweens. However, after seeing the movie I realized that it really was more than that and I decided to read the books. Book 1 was great and entertaining. It was a fairly quick read that gave me much more insight to the characters than the movie did (as usual).
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very nice game keeps you busy. I thing I can't get is how you get energy? Help anyone pls' awesome game all around
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Next to A Dance With Dragons this was probably the slowest book. Maybe that's just because it followed the action packed Storm of Swords but I don't know. Still though, it was a great read just like the others. Loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|VERY FAST PACED AND FULL OF SUSPENSE WITH GREAT SYMBOLISM AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. RECOMMEND FOR ALL WITH UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT FOR SURVIVAL OF HUMAN DECENCY AGAINST THE POWER OF EVIL.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What can I say? As with the rest of the books it was amazing. I read it in a week which is very quick for me and I loved the whole thing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent performance and story with beautiful background.  Great way to tell about the breakdown of the class system in England.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRRM is getting a little wordy with his prose and I feel like his publisher is having trouble telling him to pull it back. I really don't need 2 full pages of description of a setting. It paints a nice picture but it slows the book to a halt.<br /><br />That being said, I ate the whole thing up and loved every second of it.
1565234243|4.0|i carve with rotary tools but the techniques are similar.  I will be able to use what i learn here in my work.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|In my opinion A Storm of Swords is the best of the bunch (so far). A good amount of intrigue, action, humor, deception and death.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and this app really helps. I love being able to combine the different sounds and find what mix works best for me.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|By far the shortest of the Song Of Fire and Ice series that will suck you in and leave you needing to read the rest.
B00992CF6W|1.0|got charged on my card apparently you have to have one listed before you can apply a gift card i also have 4 other apps that my son purchased cause he didnt watch the balance you guys need to make things avalible for gift cards without a credit card being on the acount i didnt even want this
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  At one point I was sure I knew how it would end, didn't care for that ending, so almost stopped reading the book.  My daughter's had read the book and told me to keep reading. I'm so glad that I did! It has an ending you'd never expect!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the graphics in this game and how easy it is to figure out. They even helped me transfer my game to my new Kindle when my old one was damaged. Just wish many items didn't cost so many gems which take a while to earn.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator with easy to read buttons. Keeps a tally of your last calculation for easy use. Would recommend this for you everyday use.
B00947N6UG|5.0|... you'll love this! Saw this at the theatres the same day I saw Wreck It Ralph. This was the more surprising of the two. I rarely expect Dreamworks to match Pixar when it comes to story. This was the best Dreamworks flick since How to Train Your Dragon. Couldn't wait to own it.
B000FA5STS|3.0|I discovered Baldacci through the Camel Club characters and have enjoyed his different series. I picked this one off the Kindle store, and while a good read, I enjoy his more recent work much more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really liked this game. the monkey helping you through out the game was pretty cool. hope there is a sequel. thank you.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I like Shai and the way forgery was used to do such unusual things.  I like the idea of Shai's thinking the seals eventually could become real and Ashravan would not have to restore himself every day.  I'm very glad Shai used her talent to recreate the Emperor in a good way.  I'd like another adventure with Shai using her talents in more unusual ways.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|I had all seasons of Dr. Who on DVD and was missing these episodes.  Very happy to have them.  Arrived as discribed  No problems.
B009O07NBQ|4.0|Again this was a gift for my brother-in-law.  The music is always good in the Fellowship movies.  I think it is safe to say that he was happy with it.
B0024CEY36|5.0|If you are looking for a good story,  this is a good book to read.  I would recommend this book.
B008476HBM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is a witty story that really had me rooting for the main character.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|Are there some unique songs on this CD? Yes. However,if you are truly into Hendrix, you should pass on this CD. He sounds more like he is playing at a church social as opposed to his intense creativity. He has done a lot of great stuff in his short career but I don't believe this is one of them. Jimi Hendrix is one of my favorite artist. Thanks
B008IJT0CE|5.0|great selection. I love that I can layer the sounds too. lots of water sounds. never any problems with it on my kindle fire. doesn't use up my battery. and it doesn't bug you with ads!
B004AM5QT4|5.0|As always I love the information of technical or historical subjects that Follett provides.  There is always a lesson couched in a mystery.  I find the technique addictive.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I love puzzle and strategy games and Call of Atlanta gives me both. Great games I'm glad I found it. I just have a hard time getting times done because I don't want to put.it.down.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|This is a horrible imitation of a  piano. It doesn't sound like one at all. Now I can't get rid of the app.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Love the relationship between Dr. Watson and Sherlock! Dialog is clever and it is action packed. I could watch this one again and again.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It is very difficult to operate pacman. It is not at all like operating the original joy stick. It is not fun at all.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I really enjoy the Downton Abbey series.  Will watch them more than once for sure and reccomend them to others.
034580404X|5.0|This was a gift, but I hear the books were really enjoyed and were shared with co-workers.  They made a great gift.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its simple and it passes the time, while mixing in the my little pony I love (even at 14). I reccomend it to anyone who wants a fun game.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|A drama about a true life situation.<br /><br />Great fun and good laughs for anyone who has had similar experiences or not!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Must see TV......highly recommend! Great story line and great character development. You will feel like you know the characters personally.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|A good story base.<br />A drama that shows how one woman faced her fears and life challenges and found true love!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Shai, a stamp Forger, is given the impossible task of re-forging the Emperor's soul in exchange for her life.<br /><br />This book presents an idea I've never encountered before: the use of carved &#34;stamps&#34; to change the essence of things and, more rarely and impossibly, people. I read a lot of books in many genres and it's delightful to come across a new magic and culture, one I've never seen elsewhere. Well done Sanderson!<br /><br /> I'd love for this story to have been longer--I want to know Shai better! And I want to know what happens next. But this book still deserves five stars since wanting more is a compliment to the author.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great graphics and story line.  Kept me interested. Did not want to put it down, Play it through to the end
B003G4W49C|5.0|HEY U.....YEAH U...STOP READING REVIEWS TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS BOOK IS WORTH IT...IT IS...AND IT WILLL BLOW YOYOUR MIND!!! SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS. CHEERS!
B003XE3HA0|2.0|I have several  pairs of Crocs that I wear to work every day, I am on my feet all day long. I love  my Crocs, it's like wearing my house slippers to work.  This particular pair is small compared to another pair I have had for several years that is the same style and size. This pair is also small as far as height, it's like my foot is suddenly too tall for the shoe. I have never had this problem or any problem with any other Crocs products before. I am disappointed.
B009MYARIK|2.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books.  However, this one was a big disappointment.  I felt like she had a publisher deadline and no idea what to write about.  Normally I can't stop laughing.  Not this time.
B000URWYTS|5.0|The story was so vivid I couldn't put it down.  I am interested in reading more about Frank Lloyd Wright and the period.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's a story about love, loss, and football. I definitely think that it's worth your time and money. Especially if you enjoyed the movie.
B0002KPHXS|5.0|I love watching this movie. I am so glad I found this. i never get tired of watching such great stars in such a good movie.
0439023483|5.0|Still love this trilogy - and this is the best of the 3!!  Many good lessons to be learned from this series and they are well written!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|It's just a rip off of temple run the graphics are not the best but other than that it's ok.
0553804367|5.0|I purchased the original version of this non fiction work but my comprehension of the material was somewhat lacking. This version has broken down to more understandable levels and even lower levels and was an enjoyable read. How can one person, Stephen Hawking, possess such extreme levels of intelligence??? BB
B009UX2YAC|5.0|BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN ONE AND TWO! I THINK THIS IS ALSO BETTER THAN HILL CLIMB RACING. I JUST HOPE SUBWAY SURFERS 2 COMES OUT.
0307950689|3.0|Initially, this book was interesting with the introduction to the vast Masonic lore, but it eventually just fell flat.<br /><br />For three-quarters of the novel, I kept saying to myself, \\"how convenient.\\" Just when the reader thinks all is lost for the 100th time, a great big Sasquatch, dressed as Santa Claus with Tooth Fairy wings, gallops out of nowhere atop a unicorn to save the day. My willing suspension of disbelief was beginning to hang by a very brittle thread indeed.<br /><br />I got to the last several chapters and it just felt like drudgery. What would have been a pretty good story was being disassembled piece by piece for convenience's sake and I was left asking myself, \\"Didn't this story end 150 pages ago? Why are we belaboring the point?\\"<br /><br />Like with all Dan Brown's books, the writing is mediocre, but there's a lot to be learned. In short, the book was very interesting but over stayed its welcome.
0765334798|4.0|* I give Mr. Scalzi's Red Shirts one star for writing. Sitting down and writing a 231 book that holds together deserves more than one star, but because of the nature of the review, I'm only giving him one star for this.<br /><br />* I award Mr. Scalzi one star for enjoying what he wrote. It's as if he enjoyed himself too much while he wrote this farce. I should also take away one star for guilty pleasure but I won't.<br /><br />* I award one star for a unique plot - and take away one star because none of the crew members were aliens or had pointed ears (human hybrid). So this one is a push.<br /><br />* Red Shirts gets one star because I am going to use this review to plug one of my own books . [[...]] It would be very unjust of me to use this as an advertising opportunity without awarding John Scalzi a star simply for this reason.<br /><br />* The last, and most important star is because I did laugh at the farce (no spoilers in this review) and even though I had to live through a few not-so-subtle Star Trek puns, the book worked.
B00C2K5C2M|2.0|I really hoped that there would be advantages of having the book in digital form. Places of intrest and hotels are not on a offline map. All the maps are online, and not in the book. There is no pinch to zoom. The index is rater weird, no index button, or good hyperlinks.<br />I feel really cheated that i did not get the physical book, wich works alot better.
0375869026|5.0|R.J. Palacio has done an awesome job with this work. She captures with its like, from several points of view, to live with being different. It left me asking, &#34;Why do good books have to end???&#34;
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Fun game - still am on level 1.  Sometimes I want to give up but I won't let it get the best of me!<br />Really great game!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It captures the reader quick like and the characters become very real.....A very good coming of age in modern times story line.Sometimes sad, frustrating and sweet too. Enjoyed it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was great - I read it while traveling for my wedding. It's a great summer read, but not mindless, bored reading. There were a few times when I had tears welling up in my eyes. And a few times when I laughed out loud on the plane.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is excellent I really recommend this series if you like mythology, Greek or Roman. I recommend reading the original Percy Jackson series first.
1567184855|2.0|I can't say I believe we are capable of knowing what comes after this life but ALL the books I read seem very limited by our own human reference.  Not a criticism, just the way it seems to be.  The afterlife projected in this book feels like a corporate structure with many layers.  And this books view is we are mostly tied to earth for all time when there are possibly several universes out there.  Sorry, this book just sounds like a bunch of people's dreams to me.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I'm not sure why I never saw this in the theater, but I love this movie. Everyone is so over the top and the action is great!
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put the books down!!!!! I enjoyed every bit of it falling in love with Sir Grey & all his fifty shades can't wait to see if the movie lives up to its name ;) !!!!!!!!!
B0099114WO|3.0|Excellent acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep. It needs to be more funny to be a romantic comedy, it is more like a commentary on middle age.
B000FC13MM|4.0|Am still reading the story, but it's a wonderful tale.  I've read many stories that talk about magic and its properties, but this is a whole new spin on magic.  Very entertaining!
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, but you cannot stop it in the middle and come back to it, so now we are both very tired from staying up late. However, not a movie you would watch over and over again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great just like the alarm clock on my phone, so it's easy to use.  I need it loud to wake up, and the volume adjustment is great.
B002ZG999U|1.0|A terrible movie, no plot, no story line, no acting. How did they come up with funding for Expendables 2?
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The music is great.  I've only watched it one time but plan to watch it again soon.  I like acapella to hear the voices blend.
193700788X|5.0|I have been reading this series since it first came out, and as much as I love it I am glad it is over. Charlaine Harris ended it EXACTLY how I would have. I have no complaints!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I have been a Grisham fan since his first The Firm. Great work,great read.This would make a good movie I think. Way to go John Grisham!!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It had a lovely storyline. I would definitely recommend reading this book! It was great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, that is a great book, and a must read. I enjoyed every page of every chapter.  The story was beautifully crafted,  as well as thrilling, and interesting. Loved all of the twists and turns,  waiting for the next trilogy from this author,  two thumbs up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because it has many bible translations with it.  I use it often in my bible study and church services.  Also I can take it along with me when I am traveling.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it, I hated I had came to the end of tne book, and will be awaiting her next book. Exciting, adventurous,  thrilling, a real rollercoaster ride in words.  Super good story, well done to the author.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|The coolest thing is this show is filmed in the same style as the top box office movies shown at theaters.  The show moves at a fast pace.  There is a lot going in each scene, so be prepared for crisp cutting to the next scene, but don't be concerned, the editors give you time to absorb what is happening, and they give you time to visualize the scene.  I have to admit, I am a real Eeyore-of-a-critic when it comes to many TV shows; I prefer films. For 3-decades I have watched silents to current films, however, this TV show caught my eye.  So, I presented this show to hubby and he is hooked too.  Our adult kids get a kick out of us telling them we love this show!  We are 58 and 61 years old and we are stunned at the expert quality of this TV show...we also love N.C.I.S, Elementary, and Person of Interest, but Arrow stands in first place this season.  The writers have well-developed the personality of each character and they do a fine job helping the viewer understand what the characters are doing within the short scenes.  I know, the storyline is not exactly as the comic-book; I say, \\"So what\\"?  I find this show to be totally awesome!  BRAVO to the writers, the film crew, the costume designers, to the actors, and to the set designers, the art dept,. sound dept., make-up & hair, etc., etc.!  Thanks to Warner Brothers again for bringing to TV an especially entertaining action show.  Viewers, please stay with the first season and write your praises for it would be great to keep this show going for many seasons!  It is a privilege to see these wonderful actors giving performances that are praiseworthy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it, some the best reading I have ever experienced. Looking forward to reading more of her books. The story was beautifully crafted,  to draw the audience into the story.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun app.  Great for memory.  Love playing it. Fun for Children and adults.<br />Easy to load. and play.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've been playing this non-stop since downloading it, and I love the way this game keeps unfolding.  I appreciate the the controls are intuitive, and with a bit of logic, you too can unravel this mystery.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Disney's Peter Pan is a timeless classic, not only because people say so but because it lives up to the name as time goes by. Created in 1953, 27 years before I was born, I loved it when I was 5, when I was 20 and now at 33 I love it still. It is the tale of a perpetual boy who never seems to grow up, the forever child inside of most men. While the clich&eacute; portrayal of Native Americans would probably offend some were the movie made today, on the whole it is childish in a good way that most people will still find novel in our overly cynical and politically correct modern world. The video quality and sound are excellent and the extras are surprisingly entertaining. All around, this is an extraordinary purchase for a classics or animation collection.<br /><br />  Based on Scottish playwright J. M Barrie's stage show, Peter Pan thrills as a program for young people and adults alike with its approach of exploring one's imagination through positive encouragement. To Peter Pan, anything is possible. Nothing is more than a happy thought away. It is very uplifting and educational in an age when children's dreams and very ability to dream are under constant attack by the dangerous and cynical world we adults are creating year after year. There is plenty of time to be serious - everyone can use a break from that now and then. And this movie helps a lot. The video and audio have been so cleaned up that it looks like it was only released this year except, of course, for the fact that it is not widescreen.<br /><br />  The extras are very well played in this release. Deserving special attention are the recording of \\"Never Smile At A Crocodile\\", the actor imagined cut scenes and the documentary about the original animators who Walt Disney chose to work with him in creating his magic. The documentary in particular stands out as it reunites the children of the animators as they reminisce on what it means to have been a Disney kid and how it impacts them in ways that continue to this day. It is very touching and reinforces the values that Peter Pan really stands for. There is nothing else I can say except buy this. You will not regret it. Not this purchase.o this day.

B00B8WXG9G|5.0|It proves to be another great CD created by Paul. I love every song especially Finding My Way Back to Your Heart.  Paul is a great singer/composer/entertainer and he continues to share his talent &#34;His Way&#34;.  He is a legend celebrating over fifty-five years in the business and he is still going strong. I wish Paul many more years of music to delight his fans.
1401235425|5.0|I haven't been a fan of DC Universe since I was a kid. I read & bought a few titles over the years but w/all the reboots that DC has went through it turned me away from buying anything DC related.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this story I applaud it completely. The way this was written & the way Batman was put in jeopardy multiple times and nearly killed while being set into an ongoing trap was just crazy. I'm going to purchase Vol.2 just a great read.
B0094M4OW0|1.0|Seriously, video over the Internet? Not quite there yet.  I was forced to watch this in three sessions - the streaming was interrupted numerous times, so bad my Roku hung once for about five minutes.  Not the first time this has happened with Amazon.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I . Loved this story. The sadness juxtaposed with humor was wonderfully presented. I hope the author's other works are an equal to this.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a thoroughly entertaining read.  I was really impressed with the world that was created and the depth of the characters.  I enjoyed reading the book without the need to skip through pages because of the unnecessary and explicitly detailed sex, violence or vulgarity.  Yes there are battles but the focus is on the characters efforts to reach a goal or to survive not detailed descriptions of dismemberment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Ok, let me just say that I am the kind of person who is always looking for new entertainment and fun ideas and crafts to try. Pinterest is the absolute perfect source to find anything and everything you're looking for. They have crafts, quotes, celebrities, humor, diys, food, interior decorating, and so so so so much more!

B00AWFEBDK|5.0|Brilliant exposition and insights into WEIRD (read the book) culture.  Diamond just keeps impressing the hell out of me. More please
B00AMPY54U|5.0|This is arguably Herb Alpert's best album whether considering solo or with the T.J.B.You could tell his horn was sounding as good or better than ever.Nice to have the re-issue.

B00CM96A60|4.0|This is Armin's third artist CD and I think it is his best overall effort yet.  Whereas his previous two artist CD's had a good number of outstanding tracks, they were not as solid as this effort is.  I was quite disappointed with Armin's A State of Trance 2013, starting with the stupid cover.  Not sure what he was thinking when he did the cover.  Anyway, this is a very nice return to form for Armin.  For me the outstanding tracks are This is what it feels like, Love never came, Beautiful life, Pulsar, Sound of the Drums, Alone and Who's afraid of 138?!  Anyone who has had the incredible pleasure of seeing Armin live knows there is no other DJ in the world as intensely passionate about music as Armin is.  Chalk up yet another really good release from Armin and definitely his best of the year.  BTW, if you like this I would recommend his &#34;ASOT Episode 600 - The Expedition&#34; that came out recently as well.
0767903862|5.0|read ever. Best travel book gave me the bug so i went to australlia and he is spot on. funny and does not read like a travel book. I love bryson and this is his best for sure Please everyone get this book i have bought several and givin them out
B0048WQDIE|1.0|A little over half of my book group thought this was one of the best books they ever read.  The rest of us didn't find it funny, amusing or remotely interesting.  The banter was overwhelming and felt somewhat contrived.
B000002JNJ|4.0|copy was stolen so had to replace everyone knows this albuum i dont have to say more you either love it or hate it.
1400069742|5.0|I chose this rating because Lynne Olson brought together a great deal of information  regarding certain critical events in the 1930's leading up to WW II.  Having lived through that period, it was refreshing to read her excellent portrayal of those events that were in some ways reconciled!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|movie..watched it over and over and over this is so good. you should get this asap and watch it over and over.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played this on my kindle fire &amp; it worked beautifully. I need the zoom function to work well for my eyesight &amp; it did. Graphics &amp; art work are very good. This is my favorite genre &amp; if you like a good combine of point &amp; click HOG story line puzzle solver you will like this. My only negative comment is price and just never long enough. I would buy more of this even at this price.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|Having seen this film well over a month ago its pleasing to report that the blood pressure tablets from a good GP worked and that it is time for payback. It was Saturday night, there wasn't much on in the cinema and it seemed like a good idea at the time. As it turns out this films stinks so much Vue should have provided the cinema goer with a complimentary nose peg. Let us set aside the cynically crass exploitation of the tragic Chernobyl disaster and the ethics of this. What we have here is a rotting carcass of a film that should be entitled \\"A Good Day to Give The Die Hard Franchise a Decent Burial\\". Trying to describe the plot is like trying to balance on mercury and whoever wrote the script really deserves a decent spell in a Siberian labour camp. Bruce Willis's first \\"Die Hard\\" film was all a bit special and of course it had Alan Rickman in it to make him look good and out act everyone in sight. To be fair to Willis he was then a endearing cheeky chappy who did a decent turn and who understood that acting wasn't all about how much blood covers your tight fitting dirty vest. Sadly this execrable mess about Bruce rescuing his son from a Russian mobster with a CIA twist thrown in for good measure is just a series of incredibly loud action scenes (the film comes with a compulsory migrane) and dialogue so jug headed they ought to make Willis the Emeritus Professor of Cliche at Harvard University. By the films conclusion you almost develop a soft spot for the Russian Mafia.<br /><br />Those of you who treasure the wonderful \\"Team America World Police\\" will recall the parody scene in Paris when in pursuit of \\"terrorists\\" our heroes destroy the Eiffel Tower and Louvre and kill just about every French citizen in sight. But that was done with puppets and was a brilliant p**s take. In this film we start with a huge first-act car chase through Russia where Willis kills more innocent bystanders than the bad guys could ever hope to and begs the question isn't it time that this level of brainless overkill in film was consigned to the dustbin of history? Willis now stands in the same league as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the acting stakes and as for poor old Jai Courtney this makes his performance in \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" look like Sir John Gielgud in comparison to lame brain on offer here. This reviewer had a Chinese meal after the film ruined by its lingering memory and can testify that there is nothing sweet about this film - its all sour. This review is written as a public health message to prospective buyers - you have been warned.his level of brainless overkill in film was consigned to the dustbin of history?

B007UXTG8M|4.0|I will preface this review by stating that I am a twenty-five year old male that has grown up in the generation of instant and copious access to pornography. Both myself and my peer group grow up with our first sexual experiences being a dive into the world of internet pornography. Sexual addiction is nothing new (albeit, the medical definition and treatment/payments are), but this film explores hyper sexual addiction, split identities, excess, conflict of the self, and of course... shame.<br /><br />Cast<br /><br />The film is cast excellently. The action primarily focuses on Michael Fassbender's character with some minor support from other characters throughout the film.  Michael Fassbender absolutely rivals the dark, unstable, yet professional Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'. I am willing to give the nod to Fassbender solely because the subject matter of this film requires much more emotion and authenticity to deliver the desired sociopathic results. The supporting cast is additionally formidable. Fassbender's on-screen sister is absolutely wonderful as a troubled counterpart (and her scene singing in the bar is absolutely moving).<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The plot of this film is absolutely not for everyone. This is clearly not a family film. I recommend this film if you are someone who enjoys allegories about human sexuality, dilemmas of the self, or even suffer from addictions yourself. Essentially, Fassbender's character is a fairly affluent young professional living in a big city. He works his 9-5 day job and parties in the evening. However, behind closed doors he compulsively views internet porn and subscribes to prostitutes. He sates his sexual hunger and desire for others by abusing himself sexually in the formerly mentioned activities. As the film progresses, you can see the tolls that his lifestyle is taking on him. You can even sense the shift in consciousness as he struggles with himself to overcome his addictions.<br /><br />Soundtrack<br /><br/>Subtle and very effective. The accompanying music to this film is absolutely appropriate and very well executed. Again, see the bar scene for the excellent vocal performance.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />This film was very enjoyable and very welcoming to immersion on a dark reality of life. The characters were appropriately introduced and developed, the plot moves effectively, the ramp up and eventual climax are well executed, and the falling action was reasonable given the content of the film. Probably best watched alone or with a partner/friend who is very open to sexuality and discussions on modern sexuality and its challenges.
B00B9LNK5G|4.0|On the surface this record could be seen as chalk and cheese for John Grant fans. 2010s \\"Queen of Demark\\" was a lush melodic beast from the former Czars man with echoes of Jackson Browne, Rufus Wainwright, Billy Joel and even Neil Sedaka; this was assisted by the presence of country rockers Midlake as his backing band. Listen to \\"Pale Green Ghosts\\" and it is the presence of bubbling, thumping synths which immediately provide the dominant overriding theme. Please don't get the wrong impression though this is not \\"John Grant goes disco\\" and for those who hugely admire him as a songwriter with a penchant for witty, caustic, self deprecating and often brutally honest songs the general excellence of \\"PGG\\" will not disappoint.<br /><br />The excellent opener and title track sets the theme with an almost Depeche Mode style techno grind and when accompanied by the best baritone in rock music it hits the bullseye. John Grant has had a troubled past and his recent stage declaration in London that he his HIV positive is a brave if sad admission. Yet this album has at its core the relationship break up with a former lover which he wrote about in \\"Queen of Denmark' which manifestly cuts like a open wound and any reconciliation is impossible . Listen to the haunting \\"Vietnam\\" which Grant has explained is a song about how his past lover annihilated him by showing how little his emotions mattered. His bitterness is raw and on full display not least in the powerful chorus which states \\"Your silence is a weapon/It's like a nuclear bomb/It's like the agent orange used in Vietnam/It's accompanied by an apathy/It's deafening through the years/You know it is complete and perfect/And you wield it without fear\\". A new anthem for Grant is also included the often-hilarious \\"GMF\\" (use your imagination!). Here Grant's ability to craft a lyric that leads to a loud snort is evident not least his observation that \\"Half of the time I think I'm in some movie/I play the underdog of course/I wonder who'll they'll get to play me, maybe/They could dig up Richard Burton's corpse\\". Other standouts include the gorgeous cosmic ballad \\"It doesn't matter to him\\", the sheer power of the Sinead O'Connor backed \\"You don't love me anymore\\" and the brilliant synth pop of \\"You don't have to\\" and \\"Ernest Borgnine\\" electronica meets dirty saxophone. True \\"Sensitive new age guy\\" is rather too much like Visage for its own good, but everything is forgiven for the superb seven minute plus closer \\"Glacier\\". It is one of the best things recorded this far in 2013, a huge piano driven lament, jammed packed with strings and a lyric that will break your heart. It must rank up there with the best things that he has penned as the rich ebb of Grant's voice plays over a dramatically slow piano and emotions run high<br /><br />\\"Pale Green Ghosts\\" on repeated listens reveals huge inner depth showing Grant continued dalliance with his demons, relationship break-ups, his open homosexuality which was a key theme on \\"Queen of Denmark\\" and now his health remain on-going battles. Its mix of electronic pop combined with Grant's ability to produce some of the best baroque balladry this side of Rufus Wainwright ensure that this wondrous record is a haunting album of heartbreak and recrimination.ho'll they'll get to play me, maybe/They could dig up Richard Burton's corpse\\".

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I love any movie from a Nicholas Sparks book.  Many movies do not reflect the book, but this one seemed too.  Fabulous.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Another great book from Michael Connelly. He does a great job bring Harry Bosch to life, along with all the turmoil that seems to follow Bosch around. A great read.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|We love watching I Am Number Four.  It is on our list of movies to purchase.  I can't wait for another one to come out.
034580404X|1.0|I expected better of a series of books that have been on the best sellers list for so long! How it was able to even get on the list is beyond me. The writer just wrote words; never once pulling the reader into the story. Wish I never invested into the trilogy!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This movie was funny in ways to me bc I am aware of the Bi-Polar disease.  My husband is not so he didn't get some of the parts very well.  The acting is right on with someone who suffers from this illness.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Awesome album. Great production. I don't believe you would find a better collection of musicians in today's music. I'm convinced Jon Lord would love it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love the product, its very light weight and easy to prop up and stand by itself. Very happy with this case!!
B00633W614|5.0|I love most of Jeffrey Archer's books. Some seem more 'male type', but since he is such a good writer I read and enjoy them too. Can't get enough of Archer!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|It's Tom Cruise doing what he does best.  Lots of action, bad guys thwarted, and while not particularly memorable, it's a good fast-food type action film.  I've read several Lee Child books and while Cruise did not exactly fit my idea of Reacher, one quickly accommodates because Cruise does well and the film is highly entertaining.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'll start off by saying I'm very critical of musicals. I used to not be into them at all and then one slipped into my heart (Across the Universe) and I was finally able to see what a truly well put together music based film could offer. First and foremost, to be bearable to even watch, it needs to feel natural. That means the cast must not only click, but each person must have their own personal style that they can draw upon in the music. That means NOT having someone in the background feed them what the music should sound and feel like to them. If the cast can do that, then the film will have great potential.<br /><br />This ensemble nails that \\"click\\" in every way. Everyone of them can sing and bring their own flare ...and it doesn't feel like they were randomly cast based on popularity or sex appeal only to be dubbed over with an actual singer whose voice doesn't fit them (okay...off that rant...).<br /><br />Furthermore, Pitch Perfect has the perfect balance of comedy that is played in the right parts by the right people, and again doesn't feel forced or overdone. Sometimes with these types of shows you can start with good intentions but then Hollywood gets involved and you end up with a train wreck that is grasping at straws for comedic value (the movie Rock of Ages, anyone??).<br /><br />Overall, great flick to stay in with a group of friends and find a character that best fits your friends and laugh over the crazyness. And there's something about A Capella that makes everyone in the room think their Beyonce ;)
B00CHILW64|4.0|It was a terrifying ordeal made real byt the great acting and anguish that you could feel. Such a tragic event for all concerned but inspiring in how the family pulled together and beacme stronger because of it
B009YP9L7U|4.0|An easy lovable read.....looking forward to another! The characters are likeable and makes you want a to be continued sequel.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Great history lesson about evil tyrannical rulers and what humans are capable of doing to other humans!  A must watch for everyone to learn to not repeat this again!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love  this  book because it has all the feelings of a teenager boy and girl drama and a valuable relationships
B00377V6J2|5.0|My husband was very happy with his birthday gift.  If you are a blue/Stevie Ray fan, you won't be disappointed.  Shipped fast also. Thank you.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This is what mtv used to be like before it turned into a reality Tv festival.  Sometimes you just want to watch the video & enjoy the music, not get involved in train wreck after train wreck of teenage craziness.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. It makes the watcher wanting to keep watching it to find our what will happen next. My best movie I have seen!! Suprise after surprise!!
B0010SKTRA|5.0|I started with the &#34;Universe Within&#34; but now wish I had read  the &#34;Inner Fish&#34; first, which is more tightly argued. The discussion of how paleontology, comparative anatomy and recent advances in evolutionary genetics mutually inform each other to create a new understanding of how life evolved on earth is fascinating. Structures are not thrown away but &#34;repurposed&#34; at all levels.
B000002VSN|5.0|I have purchased it before.  Due to my new grasp of technology, I can not save it in my computer and other electronic data places.  The music is the bomb!
0696204800|1.0|I was looking for a book with quilt blocks and you are thinking basic quilt blocks are 8x8, 9x9, 12x12. Well, there are 501 quilt blocks, but they are only 4x4 finished! Plus... it says there are patterns. Again, yes there are patterns but they are the FINISHED pattern and YOU have to use tracing paper to trace them and then YOU have to make sure you add 1/4&#34; seam allowance to the pattern piece. Being 4x4 finished...the &#34;pattern pieces&#34; are very small. I honestly don't see how anyone could sew these tiny little things. I am a mid to advanced quilter and I can't do that. The blocks are detailed and involved...some applique patterns.  It does say on the introduction of the book that the blocks are 4x4&#34; but most sellers don't include that in their description...understandable that they don't, they can only say so much and if they aren't a quilter, they would have no idea about this issue. So if you want tiny little patterns, then this is the book for you, but if you want nice size quilt blocks to make a usable quilt...definately...don't buy this book! The seller was fantastic in understanding this and refunded my purchase so I would recommend this seller
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very entertaining. Hours of enjoyment. Wish you could win more coin in another way. Love the prizes. I have this game on my phone and kindle fire.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|You feel for Harold as he sets off on his long pilgrimage to honor his former workmate.  At times you want to give him a shake and say &#34;For goodness sake,  just hire a car!&#34;  But as his journey progresses Harold comes to understand and come to terms with some of his relationships, both past and current.  As he continues in both unsuitable clothing and footwear you realize that this is also a penance.<br />I loved this book because it made me reflect that life is like a long route, and it is good some times to stop and look around and enjoy,  instead of concentrating on the destination.  Sometimes you falter, and stray from the path, but like Harold we all make our small mark on the world, and we get there in the end...
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love the options of the clock face and sounds....even the volume can be personalized. I am still learning all the features.

B00CL68NOG|4.0|It is funny & entertaining, of course we check out all new releases and rarely leave comments. It is definitely worth renting. Both did an a great job and is fun enough to pay the rental.

B001KZI2WW|5.0|I got this shoe because I had purchased some flip flops at a local shoe store (Market Street Shoes, Seattle, Wa FYI!) and after an hour the sandals<br />were coming apart so I returned them and instead of getting my money back I decided to get these shoes. Now, I am not a huge fan of Crocs. That<br />said I DO own a pair of the Bistro clogs, because I worked in a kitchen at the time and a fellow cook had them (they make your feet sweaty but they are<br />totally non-slip for a kitchen worker and waterproof). I liked that Crocs are wide enough for my stupid bunioned feet. So I tried these on. They did not<br />have my usual sizes of 8 or 8.5 and I chanced the size 9. I almost returned them in a couple days because I had wanted to wear these without socks<br />and they seemed too big....so instead I took out the cushy foot massaging insoles and washed and dried them on HOT. Put the insoles back in after<br />trimming just a tad off the front of them, and voila, super comfy barefoot slip-ons! They ARE a little too big, the back of them kinda shows that, but<br />they do NOT slip off my feet, partially due to the rather sticky insole. They do make the bottoms of my feet  hot as they are basically plastic rubbery<br />insoles, but my feet are always cold anyways so who cares? The dimples on the insoles feel great, and I have found these to be the perfect<br />walkin-on-sand shoes. You'd think sand would totally get inside them but it really hardly does. I trim the stray threads when they get too grungy<br />looking. I can wear them with socks too if I want to but mostly I use them as casual summer shoes with shorts, and sometimes as slippers even.<br />I have had them about 2 years, and I love them. The size does not run big I don't think, as others have mentioned, I think they are pretty true to size.<br />The only bad comment I would say is that I think they are too expensive for what they are. I paid $60 for them. But I see you can get them for as<br />low as $35 around the internet and they come in a ton of colors now (only one when I got them I think). I would buy them again.nd the internet and they come in a ton of colors now (only one when I got them I think). I would buy them again.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's the best game ever I totally recommend  buying it if you don't your missing out so it's worth the dollar
B004L79VUI|5.0|I am a fan of Robbie and The Band - this album is what you expect from him - the dramatic atmosphere - the amazing story telling.  What an album!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the ending was a disappointment.  I had such high hopes for that story line... Now not sure what path the show will take.  BUT, all said, this show is one of the best I've seen in years.  I haven't enjoyed a series this much since China Beach back in the 80s.
B005HEK3JW|4.0|The funny noses and forheads gotreally tiring after awhile.<br />The menace in the rubber mask episodes were a downer aswell.<br />Still all and all a good space fantasy with lots of character development and some good plots as well.<br />If you like Star trek (I do) this si a real treat.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Went out on a limb and bought this. The wife and I watched the entire season in one sitting. Funny, dramatic, angsty, this show has it all.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|I have not seen this movie since it came out in the theaters way back, but was impressed already then; I even bought the movie sound track on CD.<br />The HD version has breathtaking impressions where the movie was filmed.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Perfume is simple the best movie I've seen in years. Each character holds their own. The plot is original and entrancing. Not only a must watch, but must own type of movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|Fusion and Eva immediately fall in this deep passionate love without knowing each other. They both share each others secrets and past which they have never shares with past partners. They know each other for such a short time but are inseparable makes no sense.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Arnold is a beast. Yes he smokes some green, takes steroids, but that does NOT undermind the fact that this man lived in the gym. This man pioneered looking fit to mainstream. Haters hate. Winners do WORK.
B00471TLZS|4.0|This movie set the bar for the paranormal film craze of late, and nobody else has quite measured up. Excellent!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Another enthralling book in the series, on to book 5! Didn't get a higher rating because I'm not a fan of main characters disappearing for an entire book.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|it sounds good ihavent played yet but I have on D's I cant wait guys but takes for ever to download
B0064MGU98|5.0|I really love this show.  Fast paced, very entertaining and absolutely love Calinda's role - makes me want to watch every episode and not stop until the end- need a weekend to do that!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|The movie was amusing and touched on challenges one experiences when one is pregnant. Both sexes issues are shown in an amusing way.
B001KU4P6Y|5.0|I buy something new to listen to for century bike rides and this was very relaxing with a nice beat to keep me moving!
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|Im glad to have for the first time my USA beatles vinyl collection. In general, the whole collection sound pretty nice, however the<br />sound level is lower than analogue editions, I think it is beacause of the digital features of the process, and is equal with pictures<br />of portraid on the covers, but anyway The Beatles will sound amazing for ever!
B003H9M1Q2|1.0|DVD stops and jumps over sections.  I'd send it back but I am not sure it is worth the hassle.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|This game gets one star because it's too much for someone new to the gameto learn it. DDoesn't look too difficult but I don't have the time to invest in learning another game. It's just a phone guys. Follow the KISS RULE.
B00005O3VC|4.0|i love this movie. my girlfriend....she does not like it as much. but thats ok. now i can make her watch it whenever i want!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like this angry birds game as well as the others except it needs more games so you can play whenever you want.  You can only play 6 games a week.  Just coming out with a whole new angry birds would be cool as well.
B000FC146C|5.0|I had read the book before and lost it..  The book was so much better than the movie.  You could feel the isolation that the family lived with.  When the fire was surrounding Paddi  you were right there.  When you had to get out of the car and open each gate. When you had the dust blowing.  Especially the action of a parent who wish you were never born. The way she wrote made you feel like you were there.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What's wonderful about this adaptation is that it stays true to the books and Martin's work. There are a few things different here and there, but that only makes it more interesting to those who have read the novels.<br /><br />The product itself is fantastic, too. Very solid casing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game! It's a great mind tester. even though it only took me about a day to complete, it's still very fun and makes you think hard on what you have to do next.I recommend this game to everyone because it's so fun and challenging!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Perfect classical album, perfecto to put it on while you are reading!! It is just transporting while you read, it seems that Christian is playing the piano while you read the books......... Awhhhh!!!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|The same old conspiracies of government and private enterprise against humanity. I used to enjoy Le Carre but he has become repetitive and boring.
0739352989|2.0|It was disappointing to hear that Christian dialogue is done by the same girl.. They should have put a man's voice to do &#34;men's dialogues&#34;  it is boring to hear her voice during the whole Audible.<br /><br />Not very captivating as the books.
030758836X|5.0|A great read by a great writer. This is a page-tuner mystery that kept me up into the wee hours. Gillian Flynn is a master mystery writer and will keep you shocked and 2nd guessing until the very BITTER end. Really I gasped with shock at the ending. Although there are many rollercoaster hair-pin turns on these pages, by all means go for the ride and do not ruin a bit of it for yourself by reading ahead.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|For X-men First Class, I enjoyed seeing the background of the X-men series, it explained a lot and closed some 'holes' in understanding the movies
B006M4RN3U|3.0|It seems that the only worthwhile songs on this album are the three singles that were released. Very disappointing. I should have just ordered the three MP3s and skipped the CD.
B008035H16|5.0|you will find what makes you happy in your life and workplace. I tried reading the original, I could not finish reading.  I found this comic book adaptation was much easier to read page by page.<br /><br />I am happy!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I had heard that Silver Linings Playbook was an excellent movie, so I had high expectations.  I found that the story-line dragged on too long and there was unnecessary use of profanity from all the characters. The end of the movie was a bit predictable, yet entertaining.....even still I was glad when it concluded.  I do not recommend this movie to anyone under 18 years old due to the subject matter of mental illness and manipulation as well as language.
B007QS5K0E|5.0|it's very beautiful and is spot on precise to the way she looks in the game. Alter blew it out of the park again, can't wait to get Jude figure so Milla has her partner.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very riviting. kept me hooked all the way through. Gave alot more insight into the movie and alot more explanation that was left out of the movie
0920668372|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my mom for mother's day since she used to read it to me when I was a little girl. She loved it. This book brings me back to the absolute best memories of being a little kid. If you have a child now - I definitely recommend the purchase. It's beautiful :) THE absolute best memories of being read to back in the day. LOVE it forever, I'll like it for always xoxoxox
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great Movie shows how an Aspie like me and my son see the world and think.  Also must read the book!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun story and puzzles. Thanks for the hints. Just enough of a nudge to keep me moving along.<br /><br />Please release another story soon.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This is the best game ever, I love it. It is awesome!!!!!!! Buy it now it is worth the money!!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This was not a good movie at all. i wasted my time and my money renting and watching this movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As a book I could never get past the first 100 pages or so because it was so tedious but the movie was great! Can't wait for the next part.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|i enjoyed the the tie in with the Lord of the Rings right from the start. I cn't wait for the follow up.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Best Kept Secret, the third book in Jeffrey Archer's Clifton Chronicles, brings back old enemies and introduces new ones. While the first half of the book was somewhat lackluster, the second half promises to be exciting and full of intrigue. I found myself becoming bogged down in details at first but as the book wrapped up, I was drawn into Harry Clifton's brief stint as a spy and Sebastian's mixing with an international criminal operation. Seb is as likeable as his father was at the same age. I definitely recommend this book if you have read the first two.
B009CGRGDC|5.0|Although the manner of dress and hairstyles are most definitely outdated, this movie is a gem. The character development (something lacking in today's movies) of Marion Crane, who only appears in the first half hour or so of the film, is genius and leaves the audience rooting for her survival, knowing she knows she made a terrible mistake and wants to make it right. The killer is so darn nice it's disturbing...you might suspect something could be a little &#34;off&#34;, but then you might feel guilty for suspecting such a thing. The music is a perfect fit, warning your psyche that there's more than meets the eye here...it's a classic. To think that Hitchcock couldn't get funding for it because it showed ('gasp') a toilet on screen!! Very little blood and gore, no nudity, yet one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen. Take a page, Hollywood.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I did love this book. Jamie McMloone was an interesting man. His childhood was so bad. He was only a number before he was adopted. He called them Aunt and Uncle. His Aunt died first and then when his uncle died. he was so lonely. His friend told him he needed to look for a woman. He did answer and ad in the news paper. Her name was Lydia Devine. A lot of funny things happened. The end was great, and surprising. But was a great book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good..better then the first one.. can't wait to read the last ok one. It keeps you reading not wanting to put the book down until it's done
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Finally back to the old Scrapetta! It's been quite a few books since she was herself. She gets back to the basics by being out in the field and doing what she does best.
B0002BO05S|5.0|this is a fantastic movie if you've ever seen on tv or on VHS.  I was happy to have found it on DVD and priced nice.  It is a great Easter movie to watch
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Can't wait for the 4th book in this series, the first 3 you can't put down hopefully I won't have to wait to long.
B00001QGPR|4.0|Very very good album, no special effects, just a few rock songs. This is a job I've really come to love. It is not always necessary to surprise the world, you can sometimes just write songs or need to be simple. I prefer this to the noisy and repetitive Earthling (quite good album that too, don't get me wrong, but too...you understand). The only song I am not fond of, but that I could like, was it just sung better!, is Something in the air. Pity. I think the main problem with Hours, as is the case for all artists with a long career behind, is that every Bowie album is compared to what's considered to be his best. Hours is a good album of songs,a moment, that's all. The sequence of songs is wrong, in my opinion. The sequence is so important in an album! It should be like this:<br /><br />1. Thursday's child<br />2. Survive<br />3. Something in the air<br />4. What's really happening<br />5. The pretty things are going to hell<br />6. Seven<br />7. The angels of promise<br />8. Brilliant adventure<br />9. If I'm dreaming my life<br />10. The dreamers
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Good Movie.  But a little on the long side, just like the rest of the series.  Would've been just as good if they would've cut out some of the filler shots.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|I think this series is an easy read...and look forward to John continueing to allow us to foeeow Theodors progress through life...
B0053O89Z6|4.0|The series has it's ups and downs.  Not a great season, but I've bought them all so far, got to keep going and get them all.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This Movie will not let you down. Characters are well defined and quite amusing. Dialogue is pureTarantino.Need more movies like this.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Had a hard time waiting for it to come out on DVD, so I could buy it.  Totally worth the wait.
B005FJ7EIC|2.0|I rented this on a whim on a Sunday because it looked kind of interesting.  I thought there were some decent ideas but on an overall I found myself mostly bored with this.  I found it to be quite cheesy.  The parts where the kid is learning the fighting from the guy had me completely cracking up.  Overall I would not recommend this to really anyone.  May be worth a sit through if for free but otherwise save your money.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is an awesome program I have used it and intend on using for teaching my technology class very useful product
B005LAIGN2|4.0|RED TAILS is a riveting war film that's based on the true story of the 332nd Fighter Group (Tuskegee Airmen) who, though one of the finest groups of fighter pilots in WWII, faced enormous discrimination and denigration simply because they were African-American.<br /><br />Much of the acting--with special mention going to Ne-Yo as Andrew \\"Smokey\\" Salem --is excellent. Some of the script is a bit staid and corny, and a few plot details are a little hard to buy, e.g., a P-40 coming out unscathed after single-handedly destroying a German warship? Still, even the blatantly inaccurate parts of the film are very gripping, a quality that most of us want, right?<br /><br />RED TAILS is carefully and expertly filmed but has a sort of 70ish war thriller ambiance to it. Yet, with a few exceptions, the animation is pretty convincing. Anyone who simply enjoys watching aerial combat will not be disappointed. The 15-minute Double Victory Highlights Featurette is definitely worth watching, either before or after you watch the film itself.<br /><br />I would also recommend [[ASIN:B00319ECI8 The Tuskegee Airmen]], which, though not as action-packed as RED TAILS, tells parts of the story that this film does not, is more accurate historically speaking, and has an immediacy to it that RED TAILS does not quite reach.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|It works great , great for doodles , and memes its a great app over all and i recommend for every one
030726999X|5.0|Good price on a great book.  Would recommend to everyone.  Why in the world do I need to use five more words.
1451695195|5.0|It's a very well-written piece and credible. As a scientist myself, I truly appreciate the tone of the narrative and the very objective perspective of the author. The book provides proof from the scientific perspective to nullify all other possibilities that his experience could be anything but real. It strengthened my belief in my spiritual being and my belief in the Divine that created and made all life possible.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|John Green never ceases to amaze me. The ending left me in wonder as well as satisfactory knowing that imperfections can connect you with another person, and yet you can never be the other person so you must only accept who they are and carry on.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This movie had a Fantastic cast that worked well together. The plot centers around modern day mobsters with a window into the life of undercover agents. Pay attention because this one has some surprises. Avid movie buffs will like this movie.  You can’t always tell who the good guys are.
0545265355|5.0|Awesome books
B001S86J0I|5.0|An homage of all your favorite sci fi films with a dash of self effacing humor. This fun film boasts some great actors doing great stuff with a great script. You will watch it over and over and it just gets better.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I do a lot of traveling in my job and Splash Top allows me to do everything i need from my tablet instead of lugging serious my laptop.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I'd forgotten I'd already read it until a few pages into it. Nevertheless, it was as good the second time around. Brown's books are real page turners.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|really a nice game and easily addictive to it!good.i pend few hours o finish all the stage.it's very funny and addictively
B009MYARIK|2.0|This was not nearly as good or enjoyable as her other books have been. It was a not funny and had almost no real storyline to hold it together. I found it hard to continue to read but did so thinking it might get better but sadly it didn't.
B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading the last book I had a feeling that I was not going to like the way this story was going to end and boy was I right. I liked the beginning and middle of the book well enough and I thought that the story line was interesting but the way it ended and all the things that were left out I could not stand. I understand that Sookie has no interest's of becoming a vamp and so it would be hard for her to stay with a vamp forever, whether it be Eric or Bill, but I figured that a creative way would be conjured up in order for it to happen. SPOLIER ALERT!!!! But never in a million years could I see Sookie ending up with Sam. He was always portrayed as being of nothing more than a friend to Sookie and she clearly had no sexual interest in him so why in the world she ends up with him is beyond me. Its like she settled for him just because he was human. The whole ending felt rushed and not natural. SO DISSAPOINTED
B00B23O96A|5.0|Very good cd but all of Eric Claptons cds are awsome. Cant wait for another to come out as I have al of his to date
B008BU70HW|5.0|If you are a Downton Abbey fan, you'll love this! I'm still going over it but have new insight into the whole series.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Pretty much the same as on pc if not better. Love watching league of legends streams and mvc3 with this app
B006903GX8|5.0|I'm learning more about the characters and the real people from this and I so love the series! Get it if you're a fan.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like doing puzzles and this is just a fun game when you have some down time and just looking for something to do.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|You can not go wrong with the awesome music and crazy story line from one of the best Westerns ever.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is really fun and the children love it.  It was easy for them to catch on and to have fun playing it with me.  Your hands have to move fast to keep up with this game.  I wish it was set for additional timing or that you could earn additional time in addition to the diamond clocks. A lot of fun!
B00BR9WER0|4.0|I'M A VIET NAM VETERAN WITH ACUTE/CHRONIC PTSD.  IN BEING WOUNDED I ALSO SUFFERED A TBI (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY) THAT HAS CAUSED ME RESIDUAL EFFECTS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.  YOUR BOOK GAVE ME A DEEPER INSIGHT IN TO COMPLEXITY OF THE BRAIN.  AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE ME SOME RENEWED INSIGHT AS TO HOW I MIGHT OVERCOME, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, HOW TO BETTER WORK AT MAKING THE TWO SIDES OF MY BRAIN WORK TOGETHER, RATHER THAN INDEPENDANTLY.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Have been anticipating this record for a couple of months now, and it doesn't disappoint. The band's themes are maturing as they get older. They're contemplating adulthood instead of campus life; &#34;Step&#34; would seem out of place on their debut record. Nothing on here is as beautiful as Contra's &#34;Taxi Cab,&#34; but it's been in heavy rotation since Tuesday. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love birds and pigs and amazing Alex even!!! Holy mother of gangnam style awesome best game in the world...BIRDS ARE COOL
1592407889|5.0|I could not wait to read this book & I was not disappointed.  I thought it was very well written & I do hope that Sachi will receive closure from her hurtful childhood.<br />  As for as Shirley MacLaine, all of the good & special times with her daughter & her family are now gone.  What a lost for her but people like her never knew what it was anyway.<br />  Parents does not realize, kids grow up & they never forget.  Sachi wrote a book about her life, maybe I should write one too about mine!<br />  Lucky Me by Sachi Parker, is a must-read book.  It is about her jealous Mother, who refused to even give her only child, a chance...it is like, she gave birth to her, threw her away & would come back, every now & then.<br />  Money is not everything but it does help...Love, that is what a parent is suppose to give not just walk away from it.  And your only, only child, at that!<br />  Way to go, Shirley MacLaine, Mother of the Year...you will never get!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a heart touching book defenently a good read such a good books August Pullman is a gratifying character read
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Love Jen Lawrence, and the dancing is great in this movie.  The dialogue in some places seems forced and sometimes it was like everyone was just reading lines simultaneously in mock arguments and did not feel like a real exchange to me.  It reminded me of a high school play in some of the high drama moments.  Other than that, it is a positive portrayal of recovery from mental illness, and there needs to be more of them in the world!
6305882592|5.0|This is one of the most funny, weird, and strange movies ever made. The actors are a hoot!  I have been a fan for over 30 years!  The service was easy and quick!  Enjoy!!
B0032SMR1W|3.0|Cameron Diaz and the male lead are both great in this, as is the mysterious man who brings them the box.  But the end left me feeling like something was missing, I wanted more!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I've played this game since I was younger and now that I'm on bed rest for a pregnancy it's an awesome time filler :) I love that it has a bunch of different designs and gives the option to better your time by showing you stars stars for each completed level.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|This product is fast and seems like it will take any SD card I put in it.  And boy does it transfer fast.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Vibrant Color and clarity plus modernized CGI makes watching the episodes all new and enjoyable. I grew up seeing these shows interrupted by commercials and never really understood the whole story. They are all new to me again!
0345529057|5.0|For this price, 4 books of this size.... there's no complaining.  As advertised and they don't appear to be inferior in any way in quality.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love it. I don't have to hold it any longer. My hands hurt and they get numb. With my case my hands are pain free. I would recomend it to any one. The only thing is that when I lay it side ways the picture doesn't change it stays Strait.
B000NDMRCS|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie when it first came out and I was slightly disappointed.  I decided to purchase the movie years later to see if it would be any better on a much larger television with better definition.  While the effects were much nicer than what I recall, the story and acting is still underwhelming.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy apocalyptic movies because they are fascinating.  This movie IS fascinating to me which is why I gave it a 3/5 stars.  By no means is this a terrible movie but it was average in everything.  Nothing really stood out to me other than how the ice seemed to have a mind of its own at times and was always attempting to kill everything in its path.<br /><br />Overall, a decent movie and something to watch when you want to see the end of the world but I would never deliberately go out of my way to watch this movie again and again.  Watch it once or twice and you are good to go.
B004S49YVU|5.0|This book kept me interested to the end, couldnt put it down .  Would reccomend to crime and thriller lovers
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked this game. It reminded me of Mist, but it's better because the puzzles aren't impossible to solve. Even though I solved it in one day, and only spent about 3 to 4 hours completing the game, I had a lot of fun working it all out. The game is divided into 4 chapters. And if you get stuck, there are hints to help you figure it out. It was definitely worth the $2. And if you got free Amazon coins like I did, then you can spend 200 coins on it instead.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|i first got this book because i thought it would be very funny.  It turns out the book wasn't funny like i was thinking but it still had a very good story to it.  I read it in a few hours.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|BUt no one really buys movies they don't already love.<br />Considering that you will watch it for years to come. Im a nerd in the fact that if i like something, I have to have it all.<br />This morie delivered. The disc is excellent. Has all the fun you remember and more. Plus 1080p
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I down loaded this app when my sound machine broke.  I love the ability to mix and match my own sounds.
1572814136|4.0|True RWS deck.  But much more vivid in color.  I will enjoy using this deck as I go through my self discovery of learning to use these cards with my intuition, in addition to, the standard description of these cards.  I just wish they would make these cards, and all the tarot card, smaller.  Which makes them easier to shuffle in your hands.  And change the face and body of the Devil and Death.  I really like Robin Wood's deck for this very reason!  They are just so sinister looking and conjure up all kinds of negative thoughts from one's mind.  Other than those issues this is a great deck and came in plenty of time and brand new.
0786962984|5.0|I bought this game for my own kids remembering how much fun I had playing it as a kid myself.<br /><br />Although the game is somewhat modified from the one of my youth, the new rules achieve a better balance.<br /><br />I thought it would be difficult for my 4 year old daughter to fully grasp, but in the end, she looted the treasure off our smoking corpses and won the game!  ;)<br /><br />I highly recommend the game for family game nights,... but that's about it.  The game lacks any real depth for just adult play.<br />But that's not the reason I bought it.<br /><br />I'm completely happy with the purchase.
1451673442|5.0|I am feeling so much better about myself. Learning the more joy I have, the less stress I bring to my life.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|Entertaining, not a spectacular movie but enjoyed the plot and acting was very good. I recommend this movie, a no brainer.
1439130833|5.0|I read each day.  I read yesterday again then go to the current day.  Love it! Keeping the pages for later reference.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have found all of Flynn's books on Mitch Rapp to be superb.  Great stories to go with a very interesting character.
1439181780|5.0|I am in control of my life.  This book helps me see that. I am learning to dream limitless dreams.
1455519006|4.0|I have followed Mitch Rapp of Vince Flynn and thoroughly enjoy those reads.  I found this read of Will Robie as entertaining.  I will follow him now, along with Mitch Rapp.
158270208X|5.0|Writing things down is a life changing process.  I love it! This process helps you stay on track and keeps me positive.
B004TI5N38|4.0|First read of John Puller Jr.  I liked his character and his thought process as he looks at the crime scene.  A very good read.  I will get other books of his to enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and very easy to use. I think that it is the most popular has been the subject matter of time before you can also be able to use. Thank you for the game and the subject matter of the game. It is very fun to play with
B000SEIKIW|4.0|I'm solid with Newton theory, pretty good with Eistein and a bit shaky on Quantum.  Of course, most of the time was spent on quantum which I could follow at the time and other times I couldn't get my head around it.  However, focusing on the basic principles it substantially added to my understanding of some of the leading theories on how the universe was created, works and its future.  The author felt the need to try to figure out how God works in all of this.  He seemed strained to do so and very uncertain himself.  It probably would have saved him a lot of stress by leaving God out of this scientific book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Its one of those games that you look up  and an hour has gone by. I love  it. The graphics are great! If you like puzzles this is the game for you. I'm<br /> hooked!
B000FC130E|1.0|Enjoyed Gaiman's other book about the graveyard.  That thread was exhausted as this next part of the franchise was simply not engaging.
B005D4YHCU|4.0|Got this as a gift for my husband and we both love them.he doesn't usually wear sandals , but he's been wearing these every chance he get.
B0087HT36U|5.0|not an angry birds ripoff, but very good nonetheless. I cant wait for age of cowboys do come out. Good job miniclip!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|While assigned normally in 5th or 6th grade, this should be read by every adult, as it beautifully explores ideas of diversity and freedom.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome!!! use it all the time and its great! love the fact it has a memory. better than any other
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|if you are not a member of face book you can not play this if you download it you only get a tutoral.
B002GHHHH4|1.0|I cant believe that anybody actually gave this movie anything more than 2 stars. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A GOT-DAMN ARM WRESTING TOURNAMENT. Are you kidding me? I dont even know how this was green-lighted for production.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this is enjoyable and very different games to play you will not be bored. the games are fun and entertaining
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Why oh why was there only one season.  So much content, so many story lines but only one season.  Watched part of the Serenity movie last night, hope to finish it tonight.
B006M4F67A|5.0|last time I downloaded any versions of mahjongg. All aps are without money (excuse my bad english). These version I become to pay 79 eurocent... the happyness to play now mahjongg is great, very great. Thanks to the programmer.
B005ZUR724|5.0|great game! wish they made a scifi version&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!! some glitches! they always fix them! easy to play. like WOW. id play more butnim busy! addicting kinda!!
B003UYUP58|5.0|As a retired Physician I found the title interesting so I downloaded the book.  I was absolutely &#34;blown away&#34; by the writing, the content and the history of medicine mixed with modern day research.  I rank this book among the top ten books I have ever read and there have been many.  I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Congratulations to Doctor Mukherjee
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Perfect for the road trip. Whether at the hotel or camping. Well spent these 99 cents. Love the blue glow digital screen.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|I love Dido. Have all of her music. This CD has some great songs, especially the catchy beat of Love to Blame. However, she has a rapper on 3 songs. Yes, a rapper. What possessed her to do this I'll never understand. The harsh, angry sounds of rap do not pair well with her lovely voice.
B001NEI96O|5.0|I keep thinking about this film and asking ever more questions:  Who financed it?  Who put together the immense amount of time to collect all the shots of the World Trace Denter being built?  Of the MAN training as a young boy?  Of his lover living vicariously through his escapades?<br /><br />I am going to buy a DVD so I can watch it whenever I feel depressed, because the joy with which all the people involved approach the task(s) ahead is just plain heartening.  Wonderful.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I love playing Mahjong. I wish the  tiles were a bit more clearer but that could be that I have a small Kindle. The games has stuck just one time. It is easy to play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like the way this game Is laid out .  Play is very fun . I would like to be able to buy points from the coins in the game. Most enjoyable to play every day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed this book so much. Love this author easy to follow but held my interest. Now th I read the book I want to see the movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this movie on Amazon b/c it was the best price I could find! I paid way less than the store prices around here (about $25) - I got free shipping as well! Couldn't beat it! The movie is GREAT! I love the Lord of the Rings series and this is a great add to the collection. It goes perfectly hand in hand with the novel as well which I was extremely happy about since I started reading the book prior to seeing the movie. If you love the Lord of the Rings or the works of J.R.R. Tolkien I HIGHLY recommend this movie!!
B000H0Y0CM|3.0|Worth watching, if you like the old school wizard and warrior genre. The story isn't the greatest, but still an ok flick.
B008P9M614|5.0|Thank you for making a complete series of this fantastic television series.  I'm a huge Hugh Laurie fan now.  He did an amazing job as Gregory House, M.D.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Love the Nikkei heat books I am a hooked fan of the tv show castle and feel comfortable with all the characters and their crime solving
B00632HWOG|5.0|Nice and simple.  It works for me and its easy to check my mail. I recommend it for anyone who has yahoo.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I had seen many movies done in my city, Pittsburgh, PA, but no one has such a great way to show it as Jack Ritcher plus the movie is great!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for the past couple of years. It's the best keyboard out there on Android.  I don't need to ever consider another keyboard.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I bought this movie for my BBF and she loved it! She is considering to buy the other Cirque du Soleil!
B00AR83PN4|3.0|I can't seem to get &#34;the hang&#34; of how to do this game well.  It's probably a good game for others, but I don't seem to be able to react fast enough to get the colors in the right places.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Dirty Dancing has been my favorite movie always! Great sound and picture. Keep you entertained thru all the movie! Love it!
B005FRF6PC|4.0|It was nice to have some insight in to his family and the values he has been brought up with.  To be admired!<br />I have been a fan for years and to learn about his talent, dedication and routine for training.  Especially interesting was the info about how he prepares for a match and what it takes after matches to have him ready to play so soon again., I never knew what his relationship was like with his uncle Toni........very strict and disciplined, but with love.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Show begins with serious corruption yet the writers begin to build the characters so you have a love hate with the bad guys
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Firstly, the graphics are amazing. You can rotate images on the screen to view multiple aspects of an object or a scene. Secondly, the clues are clever. Finally, the interactive maneuvers that you need to do to achieve the solution are just cool. It was hard for me to put this game down.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The CD is filled with old love songs and Bocelli sings in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and English! Amazing, would recommended!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Another book in the series. I love these books, a friend recommended them when I was looking for something new to read. I knew the book was popular but really didn't think I would like them because I knew it was about a women who traveled back in time to Highlander Scotland. Well to my surpise I do love these books and would recommend it to all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I lose enough to make it interesting. I play while watching TV, and my grandson likes to play also, sometimes we  play together.
B000005B0U|4.0|gets my energy and happiness gene revved up Put that together with a cup of coffee and its a perfect way to start the day.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|silver linings playbook caught my interest from the beginning starting out with sorrow but soon progressing into a funny heartwarming love story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my new favorite app!! It's almost like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook all in one! Yes, I'm addicted lol
B003ASLJS6|5.0|nice movie, movie night folks love this movie and it made for a good discussion item. there is nothing like a good western they are here for ever
B0070W75KO|5.0|great from beginning to end...........Epica is like beauty and the beast put to music. The conflicting vocals are perfect. I bought this on LP due to the fact that is the way I like my music, ANALOG. The Lp sounds great
0783225725|5.0|never tire of client eastwood, he is a great actor and a great western movie star. this movie was good and the story line was well done.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|have a very small room to play Kinect but my lifestyle requires me to find activity elsewhere. i have seen good and bad reviews so was weary to actually purchase the item. i am so blown away about the Kinect experience i have now it actually tracks the movement that was causing me to have low scores on games and difficulty navigating through the screens
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I loved the story line it was very touching it was present, future and just plain great. great read take the time and read this book
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It won't give me the weather for my town in Kentucky. Useless to me. I needed it for tornado watches
B0015XHQTE|5.0|movie night favorite, we love this series, you can not go wrong with any of clint eastwood movies. our movie group really enjoyed these movies
1451697686|5.0|I pre ordered this book because i discovered Bea's blog 1 year ago. She has changed my life and in turn my family's and friend's lives as well. How she has transformed her life resonates so passionately within me I can't help but spread her advice and tips. This book is an easy read, full of countless tips and even recipes for homemade concoctions like lip balm and many more easy earth friendly items.<br /><br />She shares her experiences and knowledge in a humble non judgmental approach and most of her advice is easily applied.<br /><br />You will buy this book and love it so much that you'll recommend it to co workers, family members and friends- just like i'm doing!!<br /><br />My ONLY disappointment is I was eager to see color photos of her end results- wardrobe, kids rooms and wardrobe, garage, kitchen and utensils, etc.
B00003CX8V|5.0|nothing like seeing old movies, the story line is great and stars were just the best. old movies bring back a lot of memories
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am at a loss to describe how wonderful this series is. If you love British tv, you will be captivated.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|we have seen these movies a few times, when you see thses movies over and over you always fine something you missed everytime
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is amazing. I love it. If u like app's that require strategy than this is the app for you.
B00001W9G0|5.0|my kind of movie, the gang loved the movie and the young folks really enjoyed the movie as well. The stars we excellent and we watched this move twice
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is simply fantastic. Never played anything like it before, and there should be more games like this. Too bad I can't give this game ten stars.
0345529057|5.0|I can not get enough of these book plus I'm following the story on tv, the book gives so much more detail. My family is also following this story we all love it
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is one of those that you can sit and watch over and over and still be laughing and enjoying it. It is one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|love the way the story went from present to past the star was so great I just loved it. read it it's great
034580404X|5.0|A friend lent me her books of fifty shades to read and i loved them sooooo much that i had to order my own to read again. These books are so dynamic that the thoughts stayed with me for days excellent read a must have if you havent purchased them.
0790734850|5.0|lots of twist and turns, its an old movie so the young folks had to be brought up to speed on the stars and the story line, they liked the movie
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What more can I say? After more than 20 years, I feel as if I lost a good and gained a good friend. Farewell, Wheel of Times.
034580404X|5.0|this book made me smile all the time i think I even learned a few things. loaned the books to my friends they enjoyed them also
B00354YA2M|4.0|I have read (and loved) A short history of nearly everything and At Home. This is a book in true Bryson tradition. Can recommend.
1575666286|5.0|I first ran across the Gerson Therapy while watching a documentary.  If you look at several documentaries regarding a plant based diet and why we do not need meat protein, you will be convinced that this can work.  There is a very prominent doctor and scientist featured in &#34;Forks over Knives&#34; and also a Gerson Therapy documentary that offers strong proof that this can work.  I bought this book for me and someone else in order to have a guide as to how this therapy works.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking at alternate methods to treat a chronic or deadly disease.
B0071MQBX0|1.0|I have seen this video before and know the quality of Ramin Karimloo's voice. Thank goodness, I wasn't I expecting to hear it here because I was sorely disappointed. He was GREAT, but you couldn't tell it from the quality of this video. Thank goodness, I only paid the money to RENT it. Amazon always has quality beind their products. Have they begun to slip?<br /><br />My experiences with this product were of a inferior quality with audio that skipped and paused al the time; NOT AT ALL IN THE SUPERB STAGE ACTING AND PERFORMANCE AND SINGING AND ORCHESTRAL SOUND the I know the two principal delivereds. My experience were with the poor quality of Amazon's video. Thank goodness I knew the story and know both principals to have wonderful vocal skills, because the music that I received was nothing short of disastrous. Check Amazon's return policy.[[ASIN:B0071MQBX0 Phantom Of The Opera at the Royal Albert Hall-25th Anniversary Celebration]]
B001XV09UG|4.0|Yes you get to see Nicole kidman naked. Hard to say what's to much on the perverted scale but this one is challenging the limits in my onion. I mean there were like a hundred or more people in this mansion walking around with masks doin the nasty with creepy monk synagogue music playing...
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Some aspects of slavery were brought into high relief by this presentation.  Jamie Foxx did a great job as the lead character, and surprising performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson improved the movie.  There is way too much violence in this movie for me to recommend it as a &#34;family&#34; event.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show was sadly cut short after one season due to the channel's &#34;mistakes&#34;. In reality, this is one of the best produced English science fiction shows in existence.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|i like this movie for it being different.  its a little slower a little different.  no princesses and does infuse a little bit of another culture into my children.
B001N4L38K|1.0|will not start and when it does it freezes continuously; please credit my account and block any future rentals and/or purchases of this item thanks
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Having become familiar with Les Miserables from PBS, I must admit that some of the vocals were not up to par with the PBS version.  However, I loved being able to learn more of the storyline from the movie.  The acting was all excellent and I was pleased to see actors more similar to the parts they were portraying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is addicting and fun. Forget Temple Run! I love the world tour. its the best part. I think next is going to be Paris!!!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I read it and from a pure readability standpoint it is excellent. People and critics get too hung up on books and movies that don't fit nicely into obvious resolutions. Is that why this genre exists? No! It is about escapism and this book certainly takes you on a ride. Including an ending that might be a bit too contrived and not fit neatly away as have most of his other books.<br />For what it's worth, I couldn't begin to imagine most of what he writes about and he does it beautifully. That's why we love to read his work. He is an excellent author at developing a feeling from the start that hooks and drags you in. So much so that you'll push back a meal or skip a drink your dry mouth craves, just to turn the page. THAT is the sign of a great writer! And this book does those things beautifully. You won't want to put it down. Enjoy it.<br />Matt E.
B00B2166BS|5.0|sure speeds up the charging time for my Nexus 10 - and the delivery was super speedy as well. If you have a Nexus 10, you really need one of these.
B006O6F932|4.0|This is for my granddaughters birthday gift. She loves monster high. We saw it in the store after I bought it I got a good price.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Found Adel by accident - I know I'm oblivious to everyday stuff - but her voice is amazing!<br />The deal on this CD was amazing also :) (shameless plug there)<br />Adel's voice and manor in delivery - simply knock your socks off great.
B008N9AASC|3.0|There's a scene with a guy at a desk that is so bizarre. The chicken farm to food also not what I was expecting. The monks doing the sand art was amazing. I wish they had a something on the different areas that mentioned where they are at.
0446554995|5.0|I really like Preston & Child's style of writing. I am a biased fan so i would definetly recomend this book and others. Delivery was great no issue and will be buying more. I devoured this book during my travels for work. Inparticular on plane i did not realise the time and we were landing after a 3 hour flight.
0743270754|5.0|The depth of information is astounding!! You get a indepth look at these men and how their lives were shaped by their chilhood and their families and friends. I read a lot of history and have since I was little but the new knowledge I gained from reading this book has greatly changed my view of Lincoln and thoes he worked with and opposed. It is not for the faint of heart due to its size but if you love peeking into the past and behind closed doors you will find the book to be amazing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A great game, stupid but addicting.  A good game for someone who wants a way to pass time.  I just couldn't put it down.
0143116738|5.0|What we fail to accomplish in our education is nourishment of a person's inherent talents and intelligence.  &#34;Element&#34; provides a guideline as to how one needs to approach education.  It asks what is one's passion?  Not an easy question to answer for many, if one were to truly seek the answer.  It then continues by moving to the next steps; once you know the passion, then, one needs to see if there is the intelligence for pursuit of that passion.... if the answers are positive, then and only then, one needs to go after acquiring the skills needed to make that passion into a life long pursuit.  What the book clearly demonstrates is where we as a society fail to identify the passions, talents and intelligence and simply move on to the training part, as all our educational system is geared towards that last part, training one in the skills necessary to do a function, without regards in latter two.<br /><br />Element is a great book, fun to read and I recommend it.  It changed the way I look at education and it also changed the way I approach my children as to what they want to do and how they want to do it.
B006M4F67A|1.0|Games cant work on a small screen that my finger cant glide around, though if I had an IPAD or bigger screen maybe
B00AY0A71I|5.0|A Fish Called Wanda has a great cast of comedic geniuses.  You can tell fairly quickly into the movie that the Monty Python crew was involved in writing this movie.  It has a strong slap stick quality to it.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|What a scam! When I first bought the game I had all 12 restaurants unlocked as soon as I did the update. It deleted my saved game and only 6 restaurants were unlocked.... play first what a dissapointment.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The characters were real, the story realistic, and the plot kept me on my toes. It was hard to put down.
B004HYDL1K|2.0|The character looks interesting. There's some nice stylistic touches, drowned too much gore, and topped off with awful propaganda. Oh, yes... every white character is racist or like a drug addict daughter, or the whites will shoot pregnant women. And every illegal is an angel. Not one shade of gray... only whites are bad and all illegals are good (the only bad Mexican being the jefe back in Mexico, played by Steven Segal). Shame on Robert Rodriguez for making such propaganda trash.
B005FFW46S|5.0|While the end is a bit anticlimactic and &#34;too neat,&#34; and the “cameos” of recurring characters are perhaps unnecessary, a good read and continuation of prior series with &#34;oh by the way&#34; exposure of social problems that still remain ... as recent arrests of American and other slave operators shows.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|There was more mystery and tough guy problem solving but still a bit of a love story.  I like Reacher when he is in the army!
B0002NRQTS|5.0|There's nothing magic about it...Rush is one of the all time great bands.  This is one magic show that doesn't trick you!!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I LIKE THIS GAME.  it's just like Flow.  IT  TOOK me awhile to figure out what was bothering me about Neon Flow.  It's the sounds they used.  Flow has a bubble pop sound, neon has a depressing plunk sound this really makes a difference in mood.  I too noticed that the line lagged behind my finger, but it was such a small amount it didn't interfere with my game.  Still I really like playing it.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is Rush's greatest album- If you were asked to pick one album that best reflects this amazing bands style - this would be the one.  Hit after hit after hit...Finally they are in the Rock n Roll hall of fame!!!  Bravo Boys!!!
B008ODZUN2|2.0|I thought this movie was not that good. It could have been more detailed in character development and I hated the ending.
B009O36EO0|5.0|A must buy!!!!! Every song on this album is fantastic!!! Her voice is out of this world!!!!!! Best dance album in a VERY long time!!!!! 8-)
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It takes some figuring out as far as navigation, but the game is awesome. I will probably download the rest.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I adore this soundtrack. I haven't taken it out of the player since I purchased it. It has the &#34;Sangreal&#34; theme you are looking for and it is beautifully done.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Good movie. There are not enough Black cowboy movies out there and this is a good one.  Hope to see more
B000HKYNQ0|4.0|classic star trek.still good after all these years.i have all of them and the second season has great stories,i have read some of the books that spawned this show
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Right up there with the Lord of the Rings series but I wish it had come out before the LOR serie
B0035HKWLW|5.0|I had seen it before and now watched it with my 12-year old.  It is a great movie, classic Jim Carrey, you will definitely laugh.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Although it is generally thought of as a children's book, I enjoyed it as an adult. I found it charming
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|This is just some great music. Ive been listening to Poco since the early 70's. Lots of years (Poco's been around since 1968), lots of changes and era's. The Richie Furay & Jim Messina era,  Timothy B Schmit, Paul Cotton, George Grantham and some others. RUSTY YOUNG, What can you say about him. He's an awsome steel player plus he can play other various instruments. If you get a chance to see him play by all means go, I don't think you'll regret it. I realy like how Poco did Jack Sundrud's song \\"Hard Country\\" check out Jacks version on his 2005 CD \\"By My Own Hand\\". I get a kick out Rusty's song \\"Neil Young\\" I think I may have started that rumor where I lived back then. I would like to hear \\"Sirus XM's Outlaw Country Station\\" play stuff from this CD Its Rock & Roll its Americana, Country- \\"First Class Music\\"- Check it Out
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Excellent.  Very well written. This guy's imagination and detail just amazed me.  I'd love to see a movie with this story.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|If you love classic traditional kung fu flicks and you love Wu-tang music, You will definitely love this marriage of both arts. Good fairy tale type story and great fight scenes. Dialogue is fun and hip. Rza's directorial debut is pretty good. Definitely room to build but hope to see more of him in the future. Wu Tang!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Tons game was worth the money and is fun to play. I recommend getting it because it passes time well. You will not regret buying it.
B003JTHS5E|5.0|This amazing book changed my outlook on love, and drastically improved the 'emotional climate' of my relationship! The concepts this book introduces are awesome and the real life examples really ground the concepts into your understanding.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|While he's been around for a long time, I had never heard Leonard Cohen before.  I was blown away by the music on this album.  The first thing that struck me was his originality.  Second was his poetry.  Then the vocals on the disc.  And last but not least the arrangement of the instruments.  This all adds up to one word:  genius.  The album is thrilling to listen to.  It gets better every time I hear it. It is unlike any other music I've heard over the past 40 years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|\\"One of the best games ever\\" my kids said, they are playing it all the time, it is good, and they have to work towards goals
B00005JLIU|3.0|I loved the movie!!! You will too. Goofy musical. My 21 yr old niece watched it w me, and she too loved it. We ended up watching it twice in a row.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This is the greatest show ever and after seeing the last episode, there had better be a ninth season, or I WILL STAGE A RIOT!<br /><br />I loved the eight season and I will buy it once it immediately is released!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is truly amazing. I love the graphics and its as if I'm playing it on a Xbox. It's very fun and has a lot of suspense like what may happen next, will they kill the guy, etc. I give this game a 5 star rating because me and by best friend are addicted to this game. It is one of the best shooting games I have ever played. I love how you can choose the level, though even on easy it is just perfect. I would definitely recommend you get this because there is absolutely nothing wrong with it!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have read the whole series..loved all the other books..I was not particularly set on who Sookie needed to end up with... but this book was only so/so.. It didn't seem to have the enthusiasm that I am use to in this series.. Hate to say it but I am glad that it is over..
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Laughed and cried through out this whole book. I became Sky and I fell in love with Holder. Best book I've ever read!!!
0756405890|5.0|I'm not ordinarily a reader but this book is so good that it has opened my eyes to the joys of reading. It's an easy descriptive read that really gets you hooked to the plot and the characters. Patrick Rothfuss is by far my favorite science fiction writer with his tale of Kvothe in the kingkiller chronicles. I can't wait for the third and final book to come out, but overall this is a great book that I would suggest anyone and everyone to read.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Very good read.  Hard to put down , exciting to the very end. The ending was really a shock to me , had no clue who was killing.  I will be reading  the series for sure.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|i really can't find one song on this album that, when i hear it, i want to skip!<br /><br />I never write reviews on anything, but this album is the bees knees.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Great acting ...wonderful story of friendship and loving life in spite of being paralyzed from the neck down ... uplifting and inspirational ....should have won an academy award for sure ... saw it the movies but had to own it so I could share it with my friends.
0452289963|5.0|In short, this book did nothing less than TRANSFORM my being. I had turned away from my upbringing in the church because of the character or lack of it that I witnessed in others, I felt judged, by people pretending to be better than me. I needed this book to help open my eyes, I have read and or listened to it no fewer than 50 times and each time I do I learn new lessons and more. Eckhart says this book is not \\"interesting\\" but I would say it is. And I thank him for opening up his being and allowing this work into the world to transform so many lives. I think Opera for introducing it to us. And I thank myself for not rejecting it or turning away from the message. It has brought me back to God, back to the truth that is in my soul, and is helping me find harmony in my life.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I am a history teacher and thought that this actually opened the eyes of a lot of people who really didn't know the whole story of how those individuals were freed.  Great Job!
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|bad movie, it was slow and not very interesting.  Highly disappointed, but if you watch the preview it isn't that interesting either.  Don't watch
B009MYARIK|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series so much that I don't think anything can compare to those books but I have read all of Kinsella's books and continue to wait in anticipation for each and every one.  This one did not disappoint although there were not as many burst out laughing while reading moments as with the Shopaholic series--but that may be because I identify so closely with Becky.  I wondered as I finished whether or not this would turn into a series of books as well and live in hope for more and more Kinsella in the future.  Needless to say, whatever comes out, I will be on the list.
193700788X|1.0|very disapointing end to what started out as a sweet and enchanting series. In my head I have given it the ending it diserves. Eric and Sookie riding in the red convertable in the daytime, and Eric is a real estate developer, oddly enough. the end.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is fun and a great way to pass the time. five out of five from me. great game.
B009R659L8|5.0|kept my interest,loved the story line. love Mary higgins Clark and read all her writings.waiting for her next book to come out.
193700788X|2.0|This book changed Sookie and Eric both into people I didn't like anymore.  I'm really angry at what CH did to Eric's character.  Her relationship with Sam came out of left field.  The ending is horrible.  \\"I may still be with Sam around Christmas\\" says Sookie.  That's what we get after reading this entire series!  \\"I'm good by myself...\\" is basically Sookie's ending.  You really don't even need to read this book once you know that.  This book is just to sum up that Sookie is good by herself and is supper attached to her home where she \\"belongs\\".  Which is surprising considering sookie would be dead a million times over without the aid or her friends and lovers.  I loved this series up until this book.  Now I can throw all of them out because this ending is so horrible I'll never be able to read any of the other books without thinking of the ending.  Good news is there will be more room on my packed bookcase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so hot and sexy I was blushing while I read it, my new favorite book for sure.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|They should make sequels asap!!! I like these type movies with my grandchildren, as good and old style advantures like Indiana Jones type films!
1451675046|5.0|The book awakens you to the beauty of nature from the very big to the very small, and its wonders too.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I started to watch this series because of Gabriel Byrne who I think is a great actor and totally hot!  Then I got  hooked by the various story lines; all of the actors are superb.  I love how the series has you living a week at a time with the therapist; it build the anticipation for the next week of sessions.  Now I also own all of the other Seasons!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I wanted to use this app, and it was fun the first 10 min, but then it kept stopping on me, and I had to delete it. It would be fun if there weren't so many bugs...
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game so much.  It is a game that you play alone and usually I can't stop playing until I've won a game.  It's easy and fun
B00785P2QC|3.0|this is a very fun but it takes a long time to collect investor points which allow you to build certain items.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is so uniquely written and easy to get through. I couldn't put it down. Such a great concept to document the aftermath of a zombie infestation. Must read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice coin game to play, but it started me over again, I was a high level and I lost the game from downloading an update
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|i haven't loved a full album since back in the 90's when music was still somewhat original and thoughtful. SOMEWHAT. thanks to vampire weekend, i can enjoy a full record. only this time, i don't have to worry about the ribbon from the cassette tape getting tangled in my tape player.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|Wonderful animated film with a great moral.  Beautiful graphics and a wonderful cast. Everybody should watch this movie. Thank goodness for Dr. Seuss.
0679805273|5.0|ever down in the dumps? your whole life stinks? read this! for ages 1 thru 100 it is his magnum opus
193700788X|3.0|With all the turmoil in her life,I think a normal life for a while would be nice for sookie. However, there is always the possibility of a novelette later. I still think that there may be side stories here, so perhaps this isn't the end. I mean, she could always get pregnant?.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased this complete set.  It is well worth it.  So good to go back in time and see Columbo works things out his way.
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom waits lovers are recommended. Bertha is my best!!! Needless to add it is the first Tom Waits album you must have it.
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|Some great musical poetry here.  Casablancas and the rest of the band are great.  I always enjoy listening to my favorite bands get older, as we all have.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This is good it keeps my interest.  This book is about what I expected it could be more interesting or have excitement..
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Along with great singles like Step, there are also great songs like Unbelievers and Obvious Bicycle.<br />10 of 10 would buy, download, and listen again.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|This album is absolutely beautiful and so inspiring! It's also addicting! I haven't listened to an album so much in one day! Haha! Definitely worth getting, as is all of her albums! :P
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Great fun and lots of adventures in this game! I highly recommend the game! It kept me on my toes!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Even after switching phones and trying other keyboards, I'm always back to this one! SwiftKey is so good at predictive text, especially as you use it more and more
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Liked this book --- much empathy for the &#34;misremembered man&#34;.  Learned a lot about orphanages in Ireland.  I had no idea before reading this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this version is much better than the first temple run. its more fun and way more interesting. I would highly recomend this game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Loved the book and then watched the series- the book is better!! Can't wait for 2nd book in series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I don't like Tokyo because you can't ever find any of the little people I think there should be a little person in every game :):):):):D[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Just wonderful. A Classic. Lengthy of course but a timeless piece of literature that should be discovered by more readers!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved it but not as amazing as beautiful creatures. Definitely should read it though if you liked beautiful creatures a lot!
B0053B347M|1.0|Whilst this product provides good lighting, the glue that is supposed to attach the product to the back of your PC monitor is completely useless and the lighting strip keeps falling off my PC. I'm going to have to buy another product now as I want something that I don't have to reattach every half hour, but will look into a brand that provides a more robust product.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It sucks and it is very boring and corny I dislike this even more than I dislike broccoli and califlower
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I learned a lot about myself and the way I react to certain situations at work that may be affecting my career.  She had great advice and shares how she learned from her own mistakes and those of other women as well.  I highly recommend this book.  I gave it four stars because the 2nd half of the book seemed to focus on having children and I don't have any nor do I really plan to have them.  It's good to know though if I ever become the boss one day.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|No need to buy. have not installed because  i would still have difficulty taking pictures of anything or anyone facing .
B002O2THRO|2.0|I was never a big fan of Gatsby anyway and this older version did not stir any great new appreciation
B004NOH9LC|4.0|It is the age old story of a girl with great dreams overcoming a lot of obstacles and proving herself right!
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I heard of Jake Bugg through the music world gravevine, so I took a chance.  I purchased the cd with a few other's that I desired more so this one sat for a while.  What a mistake!  This kid is amazing.  I can't stop listening to it.  Every song has become my favorite on the cd at some point.  Difficult to describe because I am reluctant to crown him with anything yet (maybe because he's too young).  The music is catchy, sing-along, rock, folk, beatnic, 60's tinted greatness.  Since all artists are influenced by someone, I believe it to be mindless to compare.  There is a definite British saunter and stance to his music.  Jake Bugg has got &#34;it&#34; and I will definitely see him live.  In short, if you like music, then just by this cd!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was a masterful blend of an old western set in a futuristic world.  The cast was great - there was a good blend of humor and action.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game was amazing. It almost when have me A HEART attack when he caught me. Though the looking controls are a little choppy. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good scare.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Although the book may have had a movie made after it, it was by far the worse book I've ever read!  It was explicitily pornographic, and almost made me vomit, literally!  Why, when there are such great books in publication, would any English teacher ever have their students read this book??  I found no redeeming value in this book whatsoever.  I would never recommend it to anyone to read.
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|This book is without doubt one of English literature's greatest novels. I've read it countless times. The Oxford annotated edition is the best.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I can play minecraft where ever i go now this app is awesome but u dont get everything in creative mode like on pc js but other than tht i like it
B003D513TQ|5.0|While this is a lovely movie -- which probably over-romanticizes Victoria's and Albert's relationship -- it's worth watching for the costumes and settings alone. Just lovely.
B000O77V4W|3.0|Gift for the wife that she didn't end up enjoying near as much as the CD. Great music, but skip the DVD unless a die hard fan.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love the Doctor! The first season of Doctor Who's return is great- funny, nerdy, cute, and wonderful. The show has evolved- an gotten a bigger budget- since #9 (Christopher Eccleston), but I love going back to these episodes and watching the relationship between Rose an the Doctor develop.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig keeps it going as in his previous 2 bond films and rocks as Bond! LOVED this movie big time.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This album was a great comeback for Paramore. They explored different sounds and were able to display true artistic skill.
159420411X|3.0|The Signal and the Noise starts out as a five star book but gradually drops to three stars. The author, Nate Silver, begins well by stating that there is so much data available in the world now that it is difficult to distinguish a signal (what is true or informative) from a noise (what is distracting and even false). Silver follows up by giving three guidelines for successful predictions:  think in probabilities, be willing to change your prediction and look for consensus. Then he distinguishes between \\"hedgehogs (people who are highly focused and limited in their outlook) and \\"foxes\\" people who are less committed to a single perspective and look at various alternatives. He then states that foxes are better at predictions than hedgehogs.  So far so good. But then Silver spends from page 67 to page 232 giving examples of poor predictions in various fields. This information might be interesting to some but it does not advance his premise. Finally midway through chapter 8 he gets to what is apparently his approach to predictions, namely to use a theorem originally developed by Thomas Bayes as the basis for predictions, an approach he says will make our predictions \\"less and less wrong.\\"  Bayes' Theorem is basically simple algebra and is based on the idea of using probabilities, initially before you have any information and then after you have some data.  You then adjust your probability based on what evidence you find. For example you might guess that it will not rain on a particular day with a probability estimate of 80%. Then you find out that it rained yesterday, Now you might change your probability based on this new information,  Silver spends the rest of the book giving examples of how Bayes works in various settings,<br /><br />One problem with this approach is that it is hard to make such probabilities.  For example as I write this review the NBA is having its playoffs. You have to know a lot about basketball and in particular about a particular team to make a good probability estimate. Let's take the Warriors and Spurs who are playing as I write, Let's say you do make an initial estimated probability of 80% that the Spurs (the team with the better record) will win. Then you learn that one of the key Warrior players is injured. How does your probability change? Presumably you increase it in favor of the Spurs. But then the Warriors split the first two games played in San Antonio and have the home court advantage.. Now what?  Relying on an formula developed many years ago really does not helot.<br /><br />The second problem with using Bayes is that you cannot use it effectively for major decisions that involve a one-time choice, such as what university to attend.  You really need to do a deep analysis for such decisions.<br /><br />Finally Silver concludes with examples that show no relation to Bayes. For example he suggests that Derek Jeter is not really a good defensive shortstop because his limited range results in his making routine plays appear to be spectacular. Another example is Edmund Halley correctly predicting the return of the comet that now bears his name. But there is no mention of Bayes being used for either case. In sum all Silver is saying is that making predictions is hard because there is so much information available now and we should think in probabilities rather than certainties. That is not saying much in 450 pages. A better idea is to spend more time analyzing the situation and looking at the various possibilities and consulting people with different perspectives before making any prediction or decision that has a significant effect on your life.good probability estimate.

1476734941|4.0|Forget all other diets or counting calories.  This is so simple and practical it is clearly a win-win for those who utilize the suggestions. A quick read and very easy to follow.
0385504225|3.0|I read Da Vinci Code and A&D and couldn't put either of them down. They were very interesting and I kept reading and reading until I was done with both books. With Lost Symbol, however, I have tried TWICE to start reading it, and couldn't get past about 150 pages. The book, while it has somewhat interesting topics such as Masons and Noetic Science, is very slow and, in my opinion, VERY hard to get into. Seem chapters fly by, while others have so much detail that does NOTHING for the story that I just give up and put the book down for another day. I give this book 3 stars because it does have a good story as a base, but it's just very, very boring and hard to get into. Sorry, Dan Brown. Hopefully your new novel &#34;Inferno&#34; will hold my interest for the entire book instead of only 150 pages!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room was a very challenging game. I was very intreeged by this game. It was spooky but yet I couldn't draw my self away from this game. This was a work of art. I'm awaiting part 2 and am ready for all its challenges.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I loved the movie \\"Requiem For a Dream\\" I've heard the music used in different movie trailers and just had to have the sound track. I was pleasantly surprised to also get a digital copy of the cd as soon as I ordered it. I loved it because there was no wait to hear the music!

B00111WSNO|5.0|Enough has already been said about the music on these discs (five stars for that alone) so I won't rehash. You'll buy this for the packaging alone, because it's worth it. The photos really don't do it justice, and it is a steal at the current price. It's as over the top as Mr. Sammet and the albums he has penned, while still remaining affordable. It is certainly one of the more thorough packages that I've ever picked up (outside of huge, complete, boxed-sets). It includes a faux-leather wrapped cover which is adorned with gold-leaf. The cover has weight, and is actually textured; not just a glossy print slapped on some cardboard. The CD shells on the inside of the front and back cover are so well made that the discs are nearly impossible to remove, and are a perfect, almost polished, shiny black plastic. The shell placement also adds a nice weight to the covers, provides a great barrier for the meat of the book and gives the package a very solid feel.<br /><br />The book itself is actually stitched and not stapled. It is printed on heavy weight paper and is 46 pages long including the front and back pages that are translucent wax paper. It includes an introduction by Tobias Sammet plus his thoughts on each song. The book continues with photos, full lyrics with notations for the players, and then the story itself in long form, which is notated with the appropriate song titles and a synopsis for each half.  It then concludes on an interview with Tobias and full liner notes.<br /><br />This is a collector/enthusiast package that is put together perfectly. It offers insight into the recordings and the story and is presented beautifully. It is a must have for fans of these albums.
1476719071|5.0|I totally loved this book! Travis Maddox is the best bad-boy ever! I've read it two times and I can't wait to get Walking Disaster!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Very nice mouse. Best bang for your buck IMO, weight changing, simplistic design, ergo buttons and feel, comparable with high end gaming mice.<br /><br />Amazing response time and accuracy, the color LED is beautiful, honestly for 40 bucks you can't find a better mouse.<br /><br />Only hmm hah is the cord could maybe be 1 or two feet longer. I've got a big setup with the tower on the far left... mouse is on right but it makes it.

B005PWPUW6|5.0|The sound quality from the Bluray digital out to the D3 was better than Bluray to monitor via hdmi then to analog out. For the money it's great deal.

My collection is about ten thousand recorded items.<br /><br />In these times is almost impossible for me to find something I could call marvellous and innovative...and most of all, something good enough to call my full attention.<br /><br />This cd, did it in a very great and original way.<br /><br />This vynil, I have it in both formats, is one of the greatest musical discoveries of my life.<br /><br />Is a very clever...even genius insolent work.<br /><br />I´m certain that the Red Priest, Antonio Vivaldi would celebrate it as much as I have...if he could live in this  century.<br /><br />Od course that is just a guess.  Any way I love this work by Max Richter.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have not seen the movies in bluray yet, but I'm sure they'll be impressive according to other reviews of the actual picture quality. I just want to point out that the packaging for this set is very nicely done, everything looks great in quality. I'm not even a big Alien fan but after watching Prometheus I wanted to watch all these movies again, so I ended up buying this set without thinking about it, great price and greater value. So if you are an Alien fan, then this is clearly an easy decision.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This is a film I will never stop enjoying.  I had it on VHS first of all, but technology has gone on to other things, so it was time for a change with regards to our television and recording apparatus.<br /><br />Anyone who fell in love with ET really does need to have this product in their home.  Go on, buy it, it's brilliant!

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This will NOT work on a Kindle Fire!  The Kindle Fire doesn't have a Microphone, therefore you can't talk to Tom, which means he can't repeat anything you say!  It would have been nice if Amazon had mentioned that this game is only for Cellphones (with Microphones) or Tablets (with Microphones).  So, if you have a Kindle Fire...Do NOT get this!<br /><br />Also, there is a way to make the game CHILD Friendly!  The way you do this is:  Above Tom's head is a little 'i'...Click on that, then click on 'Settings',  Uncheck the Box that says 'Violence', put a Check in the Box that says 'Child Mode'!  That's all there is to it!  Now in Child Mode, it's not violent!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is refreshing.  It is an action-adventure, but doesn't splatter the camera with blood.  It is rough and tumble, but does so without profanity and lewdness.  It is a story about good versus evil.  It demonstrates that people can change and can make a difference.  Arrow offers a hero in the shadows.

I should have known, the guy that wrote this must have smoked his brains out, hugged too many trees, sniffed too many flowers or something else. It appears to me to be someone that lives in la la land and has no respect for God, Country or Family, not to mention responsibility. This is the only book ever that I threw in the trash. Oh, and a update on the love of my life, that is in the trash also, not because of the book but rather because of liberalism.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|It's an absolutely great time to be a Star Trek fan - and who could have imagined anyone would ever be saying that again?  Much like Star Wars, Star Trek has always had an adoring and devoted legion of fans that will line up around the block for a seat to watch the newest space adventure regardless of who's starring in it, who's directing it, etc.  However, it's not just Trekkies that are standing in line anymore.  Since J.J. Abrams took over the director's chair in 2009, he's returned the struggling franchise to prominence, possibly making it more popular than ever before.  With the successful reimagining of these classic characters, devoted fans and new fans alike have been filled with anticipation for the sequel - but Star Trek sequels haven't always met expectations.  In fact, half of Star Trek's (original series and Next Generation) sequels have been downright deplorable.  So, does J.J. Abrams have what it takes to make a successful Star Trek sequel?<br /><br />Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) return in the explosive sequel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, on a manhunt to capture former Starfleet Commander, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  After terrorizing London and murdering a group of Starfleet officers, Harrison flees to Qo'noS, the Klingon home world.  Kirk instantly volunteers the Enterprise and its crew to do whatever is necessarily to bring the terrorist to judgment.  Karl Urban, John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Alive Eve, Anton Yelchin, and Simon Pegg also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />No Spoilers...Yet.<br /><br />As far as the entertainment value goes, there really isn't anything not to like about Star Trek: Into Darkness.  The film begins with action-packed drama (much like the first film), and really never slows down until the credits roll.  It's filled with plenty of twists and turns, along with several appearances by characters that will be familiar to fans of the original series.  From the film's synopsis alone, obviously the Klingons play a part in the storyline, yet it's only a very brief introduction as the inner turmoil in Starfleet is the main focus of the film - along with the introduction to film's partial antagonist, John Harrison.  The lines between the good and evil is easily visible in the film, but the main problem throughout the film is the feeling of nostalgia - as if you've already seen this film once before.  Into Darkness does serve as a parallel to the original Star Trek film series, yet this sequel still feels a bit recycled when comparing it to the 2009 film.  The good news is this is about the closest thing to a complaint that you'll find about this movie.<br /><br />It's nearly impossible to go into detail about the plot points of this film without spoiling something for someone, so from here on out - you've been warned.<br /><br />Spoilers start HERE.<br /><br />The majority of the hype surrounding Into Darkness was in regards to the villain, John Harrison.  Since these new Star Trek films are still a part of the official continuity (now an alternate reality), you'd think Star Trek fans would have some kind of knowledge about this character - yet there was nothing to be found.  Of course, this prompted the speculation about the possibility that this John Harrison character could really be Khan Noonien Singh.  If you were one of those people that made this call early on, you were right.  John Morrison is indeed that same villain that was such a massive thorn in William Shatner's side in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  And, since the timeline has been altered, a new storyline was constructed in order for the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise to cross paths with Khan and his followers.<br /><br />Unlike the easily noticeable charm of Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n, there's not much to like about Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of the character.  Into Darkness' version of Khan clearly cares about his fellow augmented brothers and sisters, but he has no reason to hold a grudgeagainst Captain Kirk like he did in The Wrath of Khan, which takes a great deal of emotion out of this new sequel.  The majority of the enjoyment that came from The Wrath of Khan was due largely to the revenge Khan felt compelled to inflict on Kirk, but when you remove that particular emotion from the equation, it needs to be replaced with something else entirely - hence the introduction to Admiral Alexander Marcus as a second antagonist.  Sadly, Marcus' desire to take the Federation into an unavoidable war, long before the Federation is prepared isn't really a visible motive to build an entire film around.  It leads to more action, but isn't necessarily the best road taken, even though it was necessary if the third film is potentially going to focus on the Klingon war (assuming Mr. Abrams isn't too busy with Star Wars).<br /><br />Like its predecessor, Into Darkness is largely focused on Kirk and Spock.  With another film comes more chemistry building, meaning if these films continue on with their current flow, it's very possible this duo could become legends in their own right.  However, the advantages of making a television show instead of a feature film is the ability to give the supporting cast more time to shine.  The original series gave each of the supporting members the chance to further the depth of their characters, while the cast of the new films are basically reduced to offering their own set of one-liners - most of which are used for comedy.  This was also the case if you look back on the Next Generation films, which focused largely on Captain Picard, and Data, while the rest of the crew was basically along for the ride.  Of course, they already had 7 seasons of television under their belts, so it was a huge deal - but this is where the future of the Star Trek franchise comes into question.  Without character development, it will be difficult to sustain momentum past the next sequel.<br /><br />To this point, Star Trek: Into Darkness is the best summer blockbuster of 2013.  This action-packed sequel pays homage to the original series, while still continuing to draw new fans to the franchise.  However, it's difficult to justify a claim that this sequel is superior to the first film, since they are nearly mirror images of one another.  Both focus on the same cast members, both feature similar villains, and both end in essentially the same exact way.  With each passing sequel comes more questions about where the next one will take us - but until then, feel free to beam aboard the Star Trek bandwagon and embrace the outer space chaos.<br /><br />Overall Grade - B<br />FNDNreview.comt Captain Kirk like he did in The Wrath of Khan, which takes a great deal of emotion out of this new sequel.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|So I literally just read the entire book in a day, and now I want to go back read book 1, because it was just as awesome and then go back and read book 3 again. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I really need book three like now. Wish I knew the release date, but I know this one just came out, so I'm guessing 6 months. I can't believe some people gave this book a 1 obviously they wouldn't know a good book if I throw it at their head, or they got ticked off at one of the characters for either their actions or not being able to make up their mind, but hello, think back to when you were the character age, I bet you were indecisive too, but hey a decision is made in the end and you will find out some gruesome details about the king. Man, I hate him more than Celeste. I just want to smack him around. If I were America, I'd probably wind up getting beheaded. Oh my!!!! You have to get this book and the first one, and I just read the whole prince one last night, which was good as well. I kinda wish there was a parallel series with it all in his point of view. He's suddenly become even more interesting, now that I know the horrible things he has to go through. There were points where I wanted to scream at him in this book, but what America does is basically the same, so whatever, but yeah. Amazing read. Buy buy buy!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I did not read it at first but finally finished. I like it a lot and I will apply what I have learned to see the results. Book was simple and well laid out.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|As soon s Heart Attack came out, I was waiting for the album to come out. I pre-ordered it and got it in the mail today. I was totally worth it. I've listened to it twice already and I really like the song Nightinggale.Buy. Buy. Buy, people, you won't be disappointed. And I liked the liked the last cd but this one is soooooooooooooo much better!!!!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|Enjoy this movie and watch it every couple of months with the family.  The ending is the best when he finds the hidden treasure under the tree.
B005L193RO|5.0|Love the youtube video by Shawn Achor as well though...it gets you to wanting to go and read the book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a great game with a lot of ways to advance. I like that it involves time management and it also involves variety in what you can do within the game.
B004GYY714|5.0|Downloaded this app on both my iPhone's, my girl friend's iPhone, my iPad 2, My Samsung Galaxy SIII, My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2-7&#34;, My Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1&#34; .... I replace my stupid fm radio with their stupid fm five minutes commercial breaks.....<br />The future is looking good.....
B008UG0IS0|5.0|If you like contemporary jazz musicians like Pat Metheny or Bella Fleck you will love this CD.  Hiromi, Anthony Jackson and Simon Phillips are fabulous musicians.  Turn-it-up and enjoy!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on this series, even though I was a bit skeptical at first (fairy tale characters living like normal mortals in a secret town in Maine?).  My only fear is that it will end without tying up all the loose ends. I was glad to see it has been renewed for a third season!  The finale for the second season was masterfully done. They answered questions that I was wondering about (Belle/Lacey), while opening up new ones (Prince Philip?). I am looking forward to being able to watch earlier episodes that I missed, while waiting for the next season.  I wish more shows were as good as this one, especially for families to be able to watch together.
0385508476|5.0|what can I say that we dont already know, for those who have looked into and have an interest in Anne?  The 'Revised critical' is full of 'additional' historical, cultural, information about the early life of Otto and the business, and other technical details about Pectacon and Opeckta. Then further details about the events surrounding the move into the annex, the arrest,  and post war interviews with Miep and Bep, and then the controversy about the warehouseman, and the arresting officer. Then of cource, all the Lovely renderings of Annes dairy, and passages I never knew existed are in this most complete and 'un-edited' version. You will see a side of Anne that will surprise you. Then included, are all of her extra writings; The tales from the Secret Annex; her essays, and her other stories. There's even as section which details how the dairy was put together,and the proofs that the dairy is authentic. The The book is over 700 pages! with some photo's, and a darling one of Anne in close up. So if you are an 'AnneFrank-O-file' you \\"must\\" find a copy of this book! I did,  right here at 'Amazon' for a nice price.
B002IE2JF0|3.0|It basically gives a science fiction twist to Beowulf. Production a little cheap and the writing was poor but for a sci-fi addict it suffices.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Led heads run in the Family.<br />I heard the songs on the Radio a lot times, and decided I needed to own the CD, and DVD to listen to, and watch as I please.<br />The sound is suitably remarkable.<br />I would recommend the product not only to Led fans but also to folks that have affection for rock music.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars but the premise of the movie bugs me. A true story that should be told but this expensive production glosses over stuff and feels intended to be over dramatic.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This is one of the best buys I've ever made. The device fits snug on 3DS, compatibility is NOT a problem and it works beautifully when I play the new Monster Hunter. You can't get this in America so its well worth the money
B000N6U0DS|5.0|Got it used at a very good price. Arrived on time. Had original dvd case. Played with no issues. Never skipped. Conclusion: Awesome :)
B00005JPS8|5.0|A perfect sequel thematically and tonally, and it delivers SO much comedy, action, and eye candy.<br /><br />As in the first movie, Tony must deal with the legacy he is leaving. But this time, the repercussions of his legacies are hitting him from all sides--in his work, his adventuring, his health, his private life, his relationships--and he is forced to face the whole unknown truth of his father's legacy. Also, it has racecars and superheroes in metal suits with weapons that go FNNNNNNNSHK!!<br /><br />Jon Favreau is easily one of the best directors working today, Justin Theroux's script is surprisingly clever and complex, RDJ is of course hilarious, and (as always) Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are fantastic.<br /><br />Other highlights:<br />-That beautiful suitcase suit! I can't believe how well it's done.<br />-Howard Stark as a Howard Hughes/Walt Disney type of public figure.<br />-The hero vs. hero battle actually managed to feel like a scene from 70s/80s Iron Man comics. That's impressive.<br />-Gary Shandling as the needling senator is a stroke of frickin' genius.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app is awesome.  It has a great storyline and it is so intense.  Sometimes I can feel like I'm actually in the game.  This game is the best ever.  Again it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
B0007P0LO8|4.0|What twice in the past 2 weeks. I lend the DVD to friends they love it and comment on the good price
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Drama has suspense;  and the characters are complicated and believable.  Hard to stop watching one episode without immediately wanting to watch the next.  The acting is superb.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I like the game and I could have played all night, but you lose your lives VERY quickly and you keep having to buy more. I would have rather just bought the game outright for $4.99 or so and been done with it. I think this model-in app purchasing-is a non-starter. The company that was responsible for We Rule found that out the hard way and left hundreds of players high and dry. I get that it is expensive to build these games, but most people just want to own outright their stuff not have their stuff own them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best $7 I ever spent! I would buy it over and over again even if it cost $20 and they killed pocketinveditor's modding code and made game mode change impossible. Anyway, BUY this game and pocketinveditor and blocklauncher with it. Again, A++ amazing app
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great sharpener. Very easy to use, and small enough to store just about anywhere.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is a great 007 movie -- the best by Daniel Craig so far.  it is a great escapist movie for those wanting to dream on the 007 world.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|One of the few movies I've watched multiple times. Great depth and complexity. Thoughtful thriller for the discerning viewer. Enjoy!
0786958731|5.0|I love the whole series. And I think they keep getting better. The Legend of Drizzt continues the trend. A few new mechanics add to the game and help keep it fresh, while maintaining it's simple dungeon crawling fun.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This is an excellent album of country/rock.  Each song has a great beat and get you toe tapping!  I love it!
1592407889|5.0|This is one of the best bios I have read in ages. Felt like Sachi was sitting there recounting her life story to me. I loved the stories about Sachi's employment with Qantas! Highly recommend
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season of Downton was wonderful! The Christmas special was suspenseful but had a wonderful ending. I can't wait for the next season to be available!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This is a movie -- with a lot of gore... yet Torrentino makes it funny... I recommend the movie for adults
B008602KQI|4.0|I give it 4 stars, because the action was well done and the story moved along quickly and didn't seem to drag. The story seemed to follow the book fairly well.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|When I first got this game, really thought it was going to be lame.  But, as I played, found it very fun and somewhat strategic!  Now, I am wasting time playing this game instead of working.  Ooops.  You need to built structures to gain resources (ie, food, wood, gold) and as you go up more levels, you need to think before wasting any of the resources.  Super fun
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I didn't know much about Kelly Clarkson until the last Country Music Awards.  I decided to try a CD.  I love it!  I put all but one song (the Christmas song) on my iPod immediately!  She has a great voice and sings my kinds of music.
1400069742|4.0|I've always known Lindbergh was a dark character-- he was never forgiven (in my family) for the Des Moines speech.  Every time the film \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" was on, we got a lecture afterwards.  So I knew about that facet of Lindbergh, but this book explores it as much as possible, given that it was Anne who was the writer in that home.  (I felt there was too much of Anne's voice here, but given Lindbergh's relationship with the public in general and the press in particular, his personal papers either do not exist in great quantities or are simply not available.)<br /><br />The exploration of FDR and his 'evolving' stance on the events in Europe was good, and explored some people and events not brought out by some other histories.  We have forgotten the tremendous political upheaval during 1939-41 in the face of Pearl Harbor and pulling together to go defeat the Axis powers.<br /><br />Overall, a good read, with the caveat that there are (imo) too many segways into less relevant areas albeit interesting ones.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|but I was prevented from doing so by the system, despite the fact that my &#34;monitor&#34; for my computer is a 1080, HD flat screen TV.  I watched the Standard version and enjoyed.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book does a wonderful job of telling a part history most people have never heard of. She also did a very good job of connecting the two main characters. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Everyone in the house from my 7 year old grandson, his mother, grandmother and I really liked this movie.  Very funny in parts & was a good laugh.
6305718954|5.0|First I will jsut say I am not Catholic. So if being Catholic offends you then don't watch this movie. The characters were so good and the story was so good.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Not bad. A little repetitive but great for a free title. It takes some real grinding to get anywhere without spending cash.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game ever.I really love this game.minecraft rocks great graphics great minerals good worlds .I really think you should get this game. so awesome. you can build houses too minecraf
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed it very much and that's why it gets four stars but it's very short, however it's two bucks for the game so I guess that's why it's short. This game has real potential to go on. The graphics are well done, the puzzles are fun, it's a cool little story. Even the background music is a little creepy to get you more into the game. It's not as hard as Myst if you've ever played that.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Well done movie and the casting was perfect. Chuck's novel was depicted in a creative way that allows you to get into the mind of the lead character without any problem. Sucks you in and takes no prisoners.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I'm not going to go into how much I like or dislike this book(s)...it's fine. And please forgive if this has been mentioned before in the bazillion reviews already about this book, but my suspicions about this series finally hit me smack in the face with Ms. Day's shout out to Nora Roberts. So, no she is not basing Gideon Cross on Christian Grey...no, no, no. Gideon is the psychotic twin of Roark from Nora Roberts' \\"In Death\\" series. They are even described exactly the same (appearance only, plus money and power and real estate, etc.). Oh, and of course the girl's name is Eva...yet she is no Eve Dallas. Not even close. And now I know, and maybe it's because I'm knee-deep right now in the \\"In Death\\" series, but the reason that Eva calls Gideon \\"Ace\\" is because that's what Eve calls Roark. Let me preface that in no way whatsoever am I comparing Roark to Gideon and vice versa. Roark is all the wonderful and sexy adjectives one can name, and Gideon is just the opposite. Ah...I feel so much better...this was bothering me greatly.
0062231375|4.0|This book is a good read. At points very funny. As I read this book I kept visualizing the author to look like Howard Stern.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|\\"Star Trek into Darkness\\" is the best movie so far this year. Expertly plotted, edited and directed, it's funny and scary. The villain, whose true identity I won't spoil, is scary as hell. Way scarier than that Nero dude from the first movie. And I love how the new films acknowledge the Shatner/Nimoy films that came before. It's very clever.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Everyone should see this movie!!! its incredible, Leo and Jamie were amazing!!! Quentin you really outdone yourself with this one!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautiful read, I laughed, cried and laughed again. Life is to short to not to. I recommend this to anyone exploring life's journey or trying to sort what it is all about.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is a great game for kids and those of us who were kids once.  It challenges your geometry skills.
0307895475|3.0|This book is not for the faint of heart!  It's totally overpacked with information, but no walkthroughs... and it tips the scales at 1825 grams!... or almost 4 pounds! At 864 pages it is by far the thickest game guide I have ever purchased... almost 3 times thicker than the guide I bought for Metal Gear Solid 4, yet with all this paper they use a smaller than average font in the printed material... probably 8 or 10 point font. I need a page magnifyer!  This is an enormous game real estate wise.  I would rate the organization of material at around 6.5 out of 10.  Yet, IMHO this is still good reference material... and I would recommend this book to anyone who has the Skyrim game.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I was very disappointed in the style of the music on this disc.  As an avid DM fan through the 90s and beyond, they finally lost me on this one.  :(
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I personally just thought this moive was average. The acting is ok. But the storyline to me was lacking. I guess I just think all of mark wallburges movies should hold up to shooter.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Well I just opened the cpu and I noticed a finger print on the actual cpu itself, so I am wondering if I got a returned one. Cant test it yet because I still have not received my motherboard ( newegg why you soo slow )<br /><br />Ill keep this review updated as parts come in.<br /><br />5/17/2013 Current rating 5 stars<br /><br />7/17/2013 Had to RMA this chip due faulty gpu section of the apu, displaying blue particles on screen, Normally this is where I would take off a star but AMD is awesome, they responded to my RMA within minutes provided a prepaid FedEx label. Its rare for a company to step up and pay for shipping to them I really appreciate it. So good job AMD 5 Stars<br /><br />9/16/13<br />-Well guys this chip is running awesome, Its currently in my free nas server running a raid-z config. Not really a graphically intensive build, but it does handle the multi-disk load off the onboard chipset just fine. Overall I am very happy with this chip.
B00942OO7U|5.0|What a great true story about a very human man with a passion for God's work.  I think I'd like to show this to a group of kids and have a discussion after words about making a difference.  The costs of leaving those you love, and whether or not it is worth it.  I imagine his wife is an amazing person.
1932907009|5.0|This is a must have for all screenwriters!  It is one that you will return to again and again (and again).
B00CL68NOG|3.0|A decent movie, mildly funny and entertaining although a little far fetched. Acting was good, script needed more work. Streisand did a good job although it seems strange for her to use this movie as her return vehicle.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|My only complaint is that Facebook itself changes all the time.  I find it hard to find the same functions in the same place on my Kindle Fire HD as I have on my MacBook Pro.  And I have had a really hard time switching between my husband's account and my account.  I will learn how to do that though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a great end to the series. I hope to see more from Suzanne Collins. I loved iy
B005HSL626|4.0|i like it. Its what I expected it to be like. Thank you for asking how I liked it d
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I loved how they moved the story along much faster than season 3. On season 3 they dragged the baby kidnapping for way too long. This one had the great pace.
145210655X|5.0|I got this for my husband for a fathers' day gift, as he is a star wars fan.  He liked it a lot, and our son likes it even more.  He will spend hours looking at the pictures and reading the words, laughing, even though he has only seen part of one movie.
0920668372|5.0|My mom passed away this year, so I have a whole new perspective of this book.  I recommend it for families of all ages.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|For any woman... Whether working for a Fortune 500, non profit, or full-time mom raising a family- these experiences and stories must be shared with not only daughters but sons, boyfriends, husbands and friends. Inspiring!
B002RI9YCI|5.0|Clever writing, witty and charming. This is a novella to be devoured in a sitting.  I suggest taking note of the authors recommended to the 'uncommon reader.'
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|what can you say or not say about this movie just amazing in all area's of the film if you don't watch it your the ones that misses out.aussie willie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very very good graphics and very fun and addicting there no end ans to what you could do with your horse. Your could feed it brush it and take care of it as well as race and compete it
0679805273|5.0|I got this book to give my kids when they graduate.  I plan to have their teachers sign it each year with a short note, so they can look back and see all the people who have helped set them up on their path to go any place they choose!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this after watching the HBO series and was pleasantly surprised at how closely the show followed the book.  Much easier to understand the characters after reading the book (as is normal).  I am already on Book 3 since i have no patience to wait for the series to be complete.  I would highly recommend.
0345455681|5.0|I love Rutherfurd. He presents history in such an entertaining way, I looked forward to getting back to it, every chance I had. I'm a huge fan.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|Connected to a Nikon D3200, this mic doesn't produce audio that I can use. The noise floor is way too high. Although it is really inexpensive and well built, its probably better to save a bit more money and spring for something with a higher sensitivity, this is somewhere around -52dB. You can get something like a Rode SmartLave that has sensitivity in the -35dB range and have a much less hissy result.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|like very much liked this movie the visual affects are amazing in 3-D the story line very good except the last 15 minutes didn't do much for me. all the lead up to the end and a bit dissapointing for me but still a lovely movie thanks. aussie willie
B001K3K5MO|5.0|I've probably watched this movie at least 20 times, the last time [before this time on Amazon Prime instant video], was on a Laser Disc... so you know how long ago that had to be. My, I still believe that Kelly McGillis was one of the most beautiful women of all time during this period!  One thing that I find amusing is that I despised Val Kilmer for years after this movie.  I still blame him for Goose's death. ;)  The Amazon Prime Instant Video presentation of this movie was excellent. And I have to watch in SD instead of HD due to my slow DSL.
B005J39FAY|5.0|Brilliant .  Both my kids love it.  I could read It to them over and over brings back memories from my own childhood
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Like many other Tolkien fans I was looking forward to The Hobbit with both great expectations and great caution.  Even though I agree with many of the nay-sayers on certain points (too many frenetic computer effects scenes) I loved the movie anyway. Cinematography, special effects,and all that jazz is not as important to me as the finer details. The casting, the music, and Jackson's wonderful team of designers/costumers  make the film.  Casting Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield was genius. After treating Gimli as a sort of comic relief in LOTR I'm glad to see that Jackson could see the proud, dark, noble side of dwarves as well. Many of the reviews complained about the long songs!  I guess those folks never read the book.  The Hobbit book is full of song and poetry and I was thrilled by the inclusion of some of it.<br /><br />I look forward (with great caution)to see how he portrays Beorn, my favorite character.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was great.  Story followed the book line nicely.  But seeing the gore and reading about it are different.  I prefer to read but the move was very good.  I love Katniss and everything she represents.  Her humanity and her desire to make her world a better place.  Jennifer Lawrence did a great job of bringing Katmiss to life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game. lots of fun i play it all the time to waste time. i really wish it had a tutorial at the beginning of it so you know how to do and how to use everything.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show and would recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh.  The characters are fun and Zooey is just great!
B000FA675C|4.0|Mysterious clues, murderous adversaries, frightening deadlines, exciting puzzles!  Remember that this is fiction and enjoy this fast paced, thought provoking story.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Some things die hard. Who would think that it should be necessary to write a book arguing against something as absurd and self-defeating as the concept of free will in the 21st century? But people still believe in it. In the same way that people believe in gods, demons, ghosts, poltergeists, homeopathy, reiki and astrology. So, Harris grabs his famous nonsense-pulverizing intellectual sledgehammer and hits the concept of free will with it. The result is typical Harris: sharp, eloquent, polished, magisterial. And brutal. The guy is a master of the polemic. I wish he wrote more books.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I recommend this to all LTR fans and look forward to the next installment. Wonderful fantasy keeping with the tradition of JRR Tolkiens work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had heard of this book for many years, I am glad I finally read it.  It is an easy read, with fast paced story lines.
B006M4F67A|4.0|the game is very nice. like the quality. keeps me entertained. good game and fun to play at any time
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie was very realistic.  I lreally liked the characters and the different roles they played.  It gave you a real insight as to what people with mental issues go through.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love this movie so much, I watch it over and over- and I enjoy it more each time.  I think &#34;R&#34; is so cute!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I really liked this film.  It is long and seems a bit limited in scope for the seat time it consumes.  It is however, always a mistake to read a book that inspires a film before you see the film version and I highly recommend Doris Kearns Goodwin's treatment of the subject.  There are several great performances in this film beyond those of the lead characters.  I would certainly watch it again, even with the length and pacing.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Exceptional album. their best yet. it pushes music to new places but harkens back to the greats (beatles, the beach boys, etc.)  it's probably album of the year.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|When you look for a CCG(collectable card game) you want variety and this game has it. With such a simple system it's easy to get the hang of. After a short tutorial you'll be fighting off enemies with ease. Other than winning cards you can buy them with funds or special tokens. It's a shame that you cannot delete a character after you've created one. So be careful. Otherwise it just as fun as Magic the Gathering and Yugioh.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this app on a whim and I must say I am enjoying it. The music is soothing, the graphics are beautiful and you get to use your imagination to create a perfect reef for Nemo and his friends. I only wish it was this easy in real life to repair the damage we've done to our own reefs. I recommend it for kids of all ages who love to use their imagination.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Wow. I can't really do the game justice in a short review but I'll try. This game has unfathomable depth! Seriously. The possible gameplay combos are almost endless and I haven't even tried the multi-player options yet. If D&amp;D were an MMO-style game it would look like this so get ready to hack &amp; slash. I love it. I'm also impressed that the graphics are so smooth considering how rich the visuals are and how much is going on on the screen. Stop reading reviews now and download the game already!
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|A interesting exploration of the evil in humans and living with that fact.  Well Acted. Simple yet deep and it is always nice to see a movie with substance and reality.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is so easy to use to find and read books from Amazon. I recommend it to everyone who likes to read
B002WN35DC|5.0|No lo cre&iacute; lo bueno de los comentarios acerca de est&eacute; libr&oacute;, en realidad es un libro s&iacute; tratas de entenderlo es muy filosof&iacute;co.
076421120X|4.0|Most people who know of Darlene Zschech know of her as the star of the Hillsong Australia movement. This is a movement of contemporary worship, written from within an evangelical and Pentecostal milieu. Few people know that she is also the co-pastor of a church on the coast of Australia. Fewer still that she is an author of books.<br /><br />Pastor Zschech has recently released a devotional designed to help people know Jesus better, and fall in love with Jesus all over again. In Revealing Jesus, each day's study begins with a verse, then a devotional thought is shared, and after thought a brief prayer is prescribed for the reader to pray. In other words, the devotional has a pretty traditional format.<br /><br />What is well-done about Revealing Jesus is that throughout the year of study, Zschech takes on some pretty useful series' of study. For instance, there is a rather extensive look at Revelation in November. In another month, the names of God are focused upon. And, at the end of every month a classic devotion written by a devotional master of days gone by.<br /><br />The book is bound in a durable hardcover. This is good because the devotional will last through years of use and abuse. The layout of the pages are appealing, although I think they are perhaps more appealing to women than to men.<br /><br />This is a great book to guide one's quiet time. I think it would be an especially good gift from a grandmother to her grandchild, or to a recent graduate of high school who is a believer in Jesus. The book has a lot to teach the heart about worship, and the mind about love for the Lord.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Found it to be thought provoking and overall a really good read. I would totally recommend this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Even though you think or want this series to end a different way she will surprise v you and twist it to were your excited about it and stoked that everything ended and tied together so nicely I love this series of books!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really loved this book. I was suppose to be reading this book for English Honors instead, The Bluest Eye. It's funny cause that was mentioned in the book. I also read Julius Caesar last month so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Cassius' line about Destiny was a big influence in this book. I'm not the type to enjoy love stories, but I instantly fell in love with Augustus Waters and his relationship with Hazel. The world would be a Utopia of happy women if every man was an Augustus Waters. I cried, no, sobbed all last night reading this book. The only flaw to this book is that Augustus and Hazel didn't spend enough time together. They feel in love too quickly and I feel there wasn't enough of that love because the book ended so quickly. I wish it was longer. I also wish there had been a scene with them looking at the constellations while (SPOILER ALERT) Gus was dying. Either way I still loved it. If you like to read tragedies, or you just like to read depressing writings like I, then this is highly recommended. Also to those who love romances but not sappy ones. The writing is also amazing.
B005PK57IK|5.0|the interactions and legal situations are original and very entertaining. ONe of the better legal dramas.  Can't wait for the next season.
0793563836|5.0|This is learning bass made easy. We use the book to learn notes. My son is self taught and uses this book regularly.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good enough action, but much better read.<br />J. Reacher is over six feet and some 250 lbs making his fights more believable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love playing it!!!! The only thing is that there are a ton of adds:-(
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Excellent series to watch.  Each season leaves you waiting for more.  This is our 3rd viewing of this series and so far we do not tire of the intrigue, the time period, the vast array of costuming and sets.
0375869026|5.0|My son really enjoyed this book - finished it in a couple of days and told me that it was interesting and funny.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I love this movie and especially because my mom introduced it to me and now we watch it together best movie made. Patrick Swayze was one sexy amazing dancer!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I may not be a professional critic but all i can say is heed my advice: Read citg of bones!!! You will love it. It has all the romance but enough suspense and twist that its not annpying!  I found an old copyy of this at a simple bookshop thinking &#34; i can try it&#34;… I said this because even rthough i Love to read, im picky but trust me i was'nt disapointed. So again Read It:)
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This was my first encounter with true fantasy writing and I'm hooked! From start to finish this is a gripping tale that will have you spellbound.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|I was vaguely familiar with Flying Lotus prior to getting the record. Despite the electronic music landscape, he stands out, truly unique.<br /><br />You gotta get this record. Right now.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Nice collection of Beatle tunes. Its just too bad it isn't a two disc set. Good value for baby boomers.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|It's not a bad movie. It just has a tendency to move kinda slow but it will have you thinking by the end. There are some parts that will surprise you because you will be occupied on trying to figure out what's happening.  It movies like a classic horror which means hardly no cgi. All I can say is judge it for yourself.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|If you like Nemo you will love Nemo's Reef. The whole family can enjoy this game together or on separate devices. There is also a wonderful opportunity to learn about the fish who live in a reef and their environment.
B003L77G8I|5.0|It is a great show. I watch it non-stop. I thing it is very entertaining. Highly recommend this entire series.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a good game to challenge your mind.  It gives you practice at figure recognition and memory.  I have played it for years and enjoy the challenge.
0596522347|5.0|The book was a great and easy read with lots of tips - entirely changed my view on how to make presentations.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Good price. Good package. Cheaper here then anywhere I've seen. I like this show so I enjoyed this purchase. PLL!
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I hadn't read when I was young but I really enjoyed reading it now.  A classic book for any age group
B007EECSFA|4.0|Interesting, twisting tale that isn't as good as her previous books, but worth reading with good descriptions of characters and settng.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|It is a great show. I watch it non-stop. I thing it is very entertaining. Highly recommend this entire series.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|But before the world burns, you must watch this movie. It is great it has everything you would want in a Batman movie. The best part is obviously the way Ledger portrayed the Joker
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|it was a blend of serious and funny.  loved the actors!  i also loved hunger games.  looking forward to more movies with bradley and jennifer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|ENGROSSING WRITING AND ACTING IN GREAT SETTINGS MAKES SERIES VERY ENJOYABLE TO WATCH.LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE EPISODES IN FUTURE, ENJOY.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I used to play this for hours on my desk top when I was at home &amp; on my lap top while on the road before my ex took them both when she left. I am glad I found it for my Kindle Fire
B000OP1M6M|5.0|The most striking this about the watch is the red and blue bezel, as the nickname suggests, Pepsi. It is a uni-directional bezel with the 60 min markings and an inverted triangle at the 60 min marker and with a luminous dot. The bezel rotates with a ratchety click.<br /><br />The crown is a screw down type and adjusts the time and day/date functions. It is a 7S26 21-Jewel automatic, non-hacking movement; it cannot be hand-wound. This is the case with the hour, minute and second hands. The day and date are displayed in the window placed at the 3 O' clock position. With this particular watch you have the option of setting the day in either English or French; English set as default. The face of the watch is dotted with large luminous hour markings. All this is encased within a flat beveled crystal which is set lower than the height of the bezel, thus protecting from glancing blows.<br /><br />The entire case is polished to a bright shine, the case back is screw-down with the cresting wave logo synonymous with Seiko dive watches. The bracelet is however a bit of a disappointment; the jubilee bracelet, seems a little cheap and light compared to the look and feel of the watch itself which brings down the overall look of the watch, as has been mentioned my others. The plan is to change the bracelet to an Oyster bracelet similar to the one found on the Seiko SKZ211K Atlas/Land Shark/Gadget watch or just slap on a NATO strap.<br /><br />The watch looks and feels great and is an eye catcher, and looks and feels great. No real errs except for the bracelet which can be remedied easily.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|This is a &#34;different&#34; Michale Buble'.  I am not sure how much I like this new style;  time will tell.  I will listed to the CD many more times before I make a final judgement.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|Take this movie as it is. It was made almost ten years after the first, so of courst it will not be the same. This movie had a lot more funnier moments than the first movie but it still had some action moments that made the movie still worthwhile to watch for me.
B00CL50LEC|1.0|If you've seen the trailer, you've seen every funny moment of this film already. I actually pitied the actors trying to make this ridiculous premise work. Find out for yourself if you like, but don't waste a cent on this snoozer. Watch it for free online.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My friends recommended this show to me but I thought I really wouldn't like it.  Wrong!  I was hooked from the very first.  There are so many surprises that you really want to see what will happen next.  I can't wait for the next season.
B004V6X90W|4.0|Very interesting movie, since it was true life. The movie does not focus totally on the love between two men as it does the crafty character of Jim Carrey.  The ending was totally unexpected.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|To start off, I have to say that I love Gameloft games. Before I got this app, I already had Brothers in Arms 2, Modern Combat 4, Asphalt 7, and The Amazing Spider-Man, and I love them all. When I got this game, I thought that it would be like the same setup as The Amazing Spider-Man, which was a great setup for a game. Unfortunately, when I started to play this game, I found out it was nothing like Spider-Man. That was a big let down for me, because of how much I loved that game. However, the game is still a great game. It brings a Temple Run type feel to Iron Man. The tilt controls can be annoying at times. When the missiles are fired at you, it is hard to judge where to fly to until it's too late. The firing controller are superb. I gave this app four out of five only because of its major disappointment for me, and the bad flying controls.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|He feels like a real person and he is so dogged about his investigations that he just has to get to the very end and get his man!
B000PC6A3E|4.0|This movie was a great way to start the trilogy. It started off a little slow, but I loved the scarecrow. He is a great pshycological enemy, kind of like Psycho Mantis from MGS.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really liked the game but I don't think it's for my children.I've tried to show them how to use but I don't think it works to well.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|so far so good... would be nice if gems were easier to come by and you didnt wait quite so long for them to mate orhstch... patience makes new dragons that much sweeter I guess
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I did not really want to see it but I saw it because I like Rebel Wilson. Anyway it turned out to be super funny and really enjoyable.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I have to admit, that I'm not from the XFiles and Twilighy Zone generation to which this series is often compared to. That been said, this series plays with your imagination, engages you in the story and always leaves you wanting to see the next episode. The story line is beautifully written, everything happens for a reason and your questions are always answered (in due time, but answered).
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is fun game but I wish they had a demo mode that would let you clear, then you would have to purchase the full version.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|As a casual SC2 gamer, I upgraded to this mouse from a standard Dell laser mouse.  It feels pretty good in my hands and I like all of the different customizations (accent light color, sensitivity, buttons) and being able to setup multiple profiles.  The ability to adjust the weight is a nice touch as well.  This mouse definitely feels more precise thus enhancing my gaming experience slightly.  Of course, I didn't expect a better mouse to make me a better gamer :)  For a $40 mouse, I think it's well-made and a good value.  After extensive research and consideration of models that the professionals use (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Pro_gear), I decided to avoid spending a premium and that for my ability level this Anker was best for me.  Only time will tell in regards to durability which is my biggest concern, so if there are any issues I'll make sure to report back.  I've purchased other Anker products before so I know that their customer service is excellent.<br /><br />On a side note, I was very close to getting a Razer mouse, but couldn't get over the many reports and reviews from customers that the left button seems to fail quicker than expected for all of the models.
B008ROGQAE|4.0|I remember first watching Westworld and thinking how sophisticated it was. Many years later the special effects are not anything extraordinary but the story is still very interesting. Yul Brenner doesn't say but a few words but is like the first &#34;terminator&#34;. I actually watched it with my sons and they enjoyed it. A Movie that has lasted through the years as a true classic.
0385349947|5.0|I used to be one of the girls, who always wanted to be in a top-position and have a huge career. But when I finally joined the working life, I learned quickly, that it's not that easy to become accepted as the independent and skilled business-woman I considered myself to be. I was having a pretty hard time, to even make them notice me. As my expectations were way too high, I was really disappointed and started to doubt myself. I decided to seek advice from business coach Rebecca on Your24hCoach, which is basically a website where you can look for specific professionals and ask them for help via internet. She really helped me out and led me the way to being the person, I always wanted to be. Due to having been in this situation I always want to stay informed about Business coaching and women's status in companies.<br /><br />When I read \\"Lean In\\", I was firstly thrilled by the writing-style but also about the advice and statements Sheryl Sandberg mentioned. I remembered them from my lessons with Rebecca back then. As I got to the point where I wanted and still want to be, it shows that implementing the given tips are extremely helpful and effective! That's why I strongly recommend not only to read this book, but also to visit Your24hCoach. You won't regret it! Thanks for hearing me out ;) xx
B008Y5OWSO|2.0|I've seen both versions of this film (Theatrical -ugh..and the Extended/Intended Cut). While it's certainly not the worst film that I've ever seen, it's not a good film either, and not one I'd want to buy for my collection. Now, I can appreciate the basic story and what it was attempting to accomplish. The cast is solid and does a good job with the material (and that's what's bad). At times there are even some stunningly shot scenes, but it just rambles on and on without any direction or pace..and I have things to do.. I can also understand wanting to trim the film down, but what to cut, what to cut?.. All but 30 mins... Time may have aired out the film to it's fullness - bland and dry, like a tumble weed in a ghost town.
0486424510|5.0|I enjoy reading this book! at first though, I found it difficult to follow the author's thoughts and was going to give up. then after reading some reviews on-line again, I started anew. Maybe it was hard for me but just wanted to warn if you have the same feeling in the beginning, take a deep breath because the most interesting stuff is coming up! :)
B0006HXXBA|5.0|If it wasn't for Deicide, I never would've known about Kreator.<br /><br />I am an opened-minded person about music so I thought I'd give them a try.<br /><br />I wonder if I'm the only woman that actually enjoys their music LOL.<br /><br />Wow! I underestimated them big time, probably since I never have heard German metal.<br /><br />THEY KICK A**!!!!<br /><br />This album is heavy and brutal. It blew me away! I love \\"When Death Takes Its Dominion\\"  and I also like \\"Enemy of God\\".<br /><br />This is great German thrash metal and for a first time listener of Kreator - and German metal -  like I said, they blew me away to the point that I bought \\"Coma of Souls\\" and \\"Phantom Antichrist\\" right after!<br /><br />This band is amazing!!!<br /><br />Get this and their other albums! I plan on getting more of their albums.<br /><br />For those who rated this a 1-star, you've got to be kidding me! The hell is your mind thinking!?<br /><br />Oh, I am an enemy of God! Maybe that's why I love it ;)
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I suppose, on the surface, Cloud Atlas is a story about reincarnation. But if you care to take the time to consider a deeper interpretation of this rich and multi-layered masterpiece - and you should - it is a story about how our actions, kind or cruel, wise or unwise, caring or ambivalent, affect the lives of others that live in the same time as we do and those who will become our descendants who will live in a future time. The butterfly effect, causality in physics and philosophy come to mind. So, if you don't believe in reincarnation - and I don't know of any reason to, at the moment - this story still has a powerful message. Perhaps the concept of reincarnation is just a vehicle by which to convey a universally applicable message. When we turn down a request for a small monetary donation from a homeless person on the street, could we be neglecting to make a necessary contribution to a spark of inspiration that could lead to a series of events that could change many lives for the better and help stop the suffering of many; even alter the course of our future? It's a legitimate question.
B009AMAM9S|1.0|This movie is horrible for so many reasons. The story is very drawn out. almost every character in the movie seems devoid of any human emotion with two small exceptions. If you tried to sum up each character in two or three sentences you would wind up not only summing them up but describing the entire range of the character. Most of the positive reviews of this movie mention how excellently it shows how we are all connected. To those who think so I would recommend that you watch a movie called Five People You Meet in Heaven. Had the same theme but did a much better job of it. Next up I'd like to say that the prosthetics in this movie were bad. they did a great job at making the actors look different but most of them made the actor look too cartoony and fake. The bad make ups also added to each character seeming inhuman and emotionless. The cinematography of the movie was the only good thing about it in my opinion.
193700788X|2.0|I have to agree with all the other reviewers who were so disappointed with the way Charlaine Harris ended this series.  None of the characters we've loved for so long had their usual \\"pizazz\\" or charm.  Especially the vampires, who play such a small part in this series ender.  It really seems as though Charlaine Harris was simply tired of the series and rushed through it just to get it over with.  Sometimes a well-loved series ends on a high note, leaving its readers satisfied although sad it's over.  Unfortunately, this series ended on a very low note, with a feeling of betrayal for its loyal readers.  Very sad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game that requires a lot of consenstration!and it is neat mostley when you sign up with facebook because it allows you to compete against your facebook friends
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|I have never played pinball on kindle. There were no instruction and I have no clue how to use this. I deleted.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|It's Eric Burdon.  Nothing else has to be said.  Never heard a song by<br />this man that I didn't like.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great product for such a small price!!<br />It does exactly what it is suppose to do.<br /><br />I just love it!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie is long and not very interesting at all. It jumps back and fourth through several times but not one of the many stories in this movie is interesting to make the movie worth watching. Haley Barry's acting was especially bad in this movie as well.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I saw the movie first, but the book is was away better!!! I can't wait to read the second book!
B00336G7HI|5.0|This is the real Sony lipo battery and it gives my HDR-CX260V a solid 2 hours of power at the highest quality setting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. Loved it just wished there were more rooms.  Can't wait for the next one. Worth every penny. If you love puzzles where you have to use your mind, this is the one for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game and it was awesome until it kept freezing and crashing... maybe mojang can fix this in 0.7.0...?
B00632HWOG|5.0|Always lets me know when i have an email, so easy to use!! I use it on my Kindle Fire!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is totally worth the money.I got it 3  years ago yet still play it.It's the best game on my kindle(after trigger dead)
B0060FXBNM|5.0|What can I say, they're awesome! It's a great trilogy. My only complaint is not having the option to purchase this with digital copies.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is without a doubt the best blues guitarist of his generation. His powerful playing is now coupled with the equally impressive voice of Beth Hart. A match made in Blue Heaven.<br />This is a disc full of tributes, well chosen and executed. My personal favorite: I'd Rather Go Blind. The guitar work, especially the solo are perfectly blended with gut-wrentching vocals.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I have followed the directions in this little book with success. It's clear, simple, and well worth the (free) price.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I downloaded because seen before and wanted to try sometime. I don't know what all reviews are of virus and malware stuff. I downloaded and lookout didn't say it was. Downloaded a YouTube video and it worked ok and had no issues.
B00499NHLC|5.0|It is an intelligent, incredibly well written modern day take on a wonderful classic.  I get to see London, which I would love to visit.  But, the best part is that we are really engaged in the story line the entire 90 minutes.  LHL
B0087IT8FK|5.0|What a great movie!  Not recommended for children, as it has adult themes.  I loved how the characters interacted with one another!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is possibly my favorite Bond to date. He is the sexy, spy/patriot/hero to the core.  Ever loyal, he is the best of the Bond best!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Near flawless fighting.  Great mobility and customizing as well. Very little :( space requires purchases in game but they are cheap.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|with another jack ryan book. except this time it's jack jr's turn. the scary part about this book is that i think it is something that could really happen in this day and age. if you like mysteries, cyber-crime and/or spies, you will love this. well written and engrossing. would have loved to be able to stay up all night reading this.<br />patti leal
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This item was a birthday gift to celebrate a 50th birthday & the recipient was very pleased because he had specifically requested it.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|For those that haven't shopped this one around, the digital version from iTunes and eMusic (the only ones I checked) contains the five live tracks that were released on record store day for a grand total of a 26 song concert.  Green is a classic for me, and the concert is just plain awesome.
1401324649|5.0|At the turn of each page you were amazed at what happens in this man life. Very entertaining. Fun to read.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show drew me in because of its gritty read life and fast moving writing and production.  With seven seasons it can keep you busy.
0689835604|5.0|Our ten month old loves this book. Shes very into lift the flap books right now and peekaboo and this satisfies both. Each page has you and baby find a different body part - where is baby's mouth or feet - so she's learning body parts as well as enjoying the simple colorful pictures and words. One of our favorites!
0061743526|4.0|I thought this was a very good novel.  The novel is seen through the perspective of a young girl, Scout.  Her older brother, Jem is also prominent in the story.  There is a lot of themes and aspects to the novel.  On one level it is about racial hatred and prejudice in a segregated small town, in the Deep South of the USA, in the early 1930s.  On another it is about growing up, and the shifting perspectives that this brings.  On yet another level it is about small town life, both the strengths and weaknesses involved in this.  Another theme is seen in how outsiders, or those who are perceived to be such, can be demonised.  This is illustrated by Boo Radley, who is presented at first as a bogeyman, and then is humanised after coming to the aid of Scout and Jem.  Justice, or lack of it thereof, is also another major theme.  Even though Tom Robinson is innocent, he is convicted of  a serious crime, and tragically is later killed while attempting to escape.  This is a universal theme in justice systems across the world.  The novel highlights the enduring problem of miscarriages of justice very well.  Empathy and the need for understanding is also an important theme in the novel.  Atticus Finch's advice to his children that you cannot understand a person until you attempt to understand their perspective, and point of view, is also an influential lesson.  Overall, the characters are well defined, and the story is very good.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|very hard to use.  I haven't be able to access table of contents or the books of the bible yet.  Not friendly-user
B000MC6CMG|4.0|My used copy cleaned up first wash! Orig. pressing. Sounds great! I have this on cd too. It's not even close!
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I like the bright color so I don't misplace it and the ability to rotate it on the stand comes in very handy.  All in all a very worth-while purchase!
B000NMW6M0|4.0|I stumbled across this through Google TV Primetime and had to watch it.  I remember hearing about it a few years ago.  It was very good!  The different stories all tied together was done very well, it made the world seem like a small place.
B00821OX98|1.0|I was excited for this show to come out.  I tried two episodes and it's just too far-fetched for me.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|She played so well do as Branda. Is the Session 4 Available on Amazon Prime? Though as a ambitious and family support lawyer Mom, she could have spent more time with their kids.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high due to all the press surrounding this, but I didn't think it was that great. It was a good movie but I've seen a lot that I enjoyed more.
B003FZ4NL4|5.0|My copy came clean on the very first wash! Sounds amazing, if you like their sound, on my simple set up. Listening right now as a matter of fact to 2x4 and it sounds fantatic! Way more dynamic than cd first of all and clearer in my opinion.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|After using this app on my iPhone I couldn't wait to try it out on my Kindle Fire and it hasn't disappointed me at all. I'm not a professional guitar player so bring able to tap into this huge amount of songs is awesome and I can read it so much better now!
1451697686|5.0|Being an avid reader of the Zero Waste Home blog I was extremely excited to read the book. Inspired by the blog my husband and I had began to embark on a no-waste lifestyle but there seemed to be so many unanswered questions and the lifestyle itself just seemed so intimidating. After reading this book I picked up not only the skills I needed to also the inspiration. This is an excellent read and also a \\"how-to\\" manual for anyone looking to eliminate or even reduce their waste output. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a practical guide to living waste free in our modern, disposable-laden times.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was one of the best series I've read. Robert Jordan will be sadly missed. Brandon Sanderson did a wonerful job finishing the series.
B0080SSYUW|5.0|Great little collection. Each one a priceless Grisham gem. If you like his writing, you will enjoy this collection of stories.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Stories told by Atul Gawande were pretty inspiring. Book forced me to use some good ideas in my life. I recomend that tale for everyone who has dissorganized life and wants to learn how to deal with it.
B002IVLH6U|4.0|Very good pressing! mine cleaned up first wash! Nice and clear and dynamic! Sounds great on my set-up which is no slacker but not the upper high-end.
B008KX4JNI|5.0|Best Batman comics I've read in a while. Whether new to comics or long lasting loyal fan, Court of Owls is easy and enjoyable!
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|This CD was very well done. My only complaint is I wish there were more songs! Buy it, or you'll regret it !!!!
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|The movie kept draging on.. The plot just ok some good parts but overall not impressed!  My advice rent something else.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book places the reader right in the battle of two Pacific island campaigns. You will face the fear, smell the stench of death and endure the hardships that the Marines had to encounter before they returned home.
B00BAYLS1K|1.0|I don't wanna talk about the movie cause there will be no one who will choose to buy this movie in a bluray without knowing why we should buy this.<br />I am very dissapointed and almost about to throw out this Bluray right after i see the first two minutes.<br />It is even way worse then the DVD that I own for a long long time. The video quality is so so so bad that I cannot even compare to any other movies that I own in Bluray. ( I have over 1000 Bluray discs)<br />Most of the Lurman's Bluray Re-Release were all very good transfered ones so I believed this might be as good as others.<br />No sir. I just waste my money and time  waiting this disc to be arrived.<br /><br />I am so so mad at the releasing company.<br /><br />Please trust me and do not buy this bluray unless you never bought this movie and you like this film.<br />If you own this movie in a DVD or VHS, save your money.
0765325950|5.0|A bitter sweet end for all who have enjoyed and had this most brilliant of series as part of their life for the last two decades.<br /><br />This is a fitting tribute to Robert Jordan's vision.<br />It is highly emotive, gripping and leaves you truly spiritually drained yet replenished at the same time.<br /><br />Words cannot sum up what this book means to us and so, enjoy the experience and may reading always bring you joy.<br /><br />Thank you James Oliver Rigney Jr., Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson and all Dragons.
B00881VLCE|5.0|These are fun puzzles with great pictures to put together.  I especially like the nature puzzles.  Good way to spend leisure time.
B0072X2O66|4.0|From the guys who brought you coverta, this is the blistering debut from AMOB....you need to buy this album. By far the best metal album of 2013!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|But I can't. So a translation is required. This one is good. However, I still wish I could read French.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game however wished it be smoother in graphics. I like taking care of the horse though. Its like having your own your own pet
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a BRILLIANT game! Mainly everybody on my street has Subway surfers. When you start playing it is so easy to get into.
0375413405|5.0|This book was in prime condition.  Cookbooks are some of my favorite reading.  It is so much fun to be successful with recipes just from reading.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This movie was very good. It deals with a lot of issues and really emotionally grabs you. I am looking forward to seeing the future movies in this saga.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|If you're into prog rock, then you'll be happy with this disk. The lyrical content was very well done, with a heavy theological theme.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is my ebook version. I have also seen every movie ever made of this story. It's one of those kinds of heartbreaking but amazing stories that must be read during one's lifetime.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's not as good as Survival Craft. Personally, I think that survival craft is one of the best game ever. When I started to play this game, I was kind of dissapponted with the graphics and controling systems.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game. I just wish it had more choices for background colors and textures along with more choices for card faces and designs.
B008XG1X18|3.0|while i wish i had time to look at all this app has to offer- i do not have the time or energy to do so
B000RIWAVW|5.0|and still good... my first favorite slasher flick... little nuances like the tilt of his head when he pins the blonde dude to the kitchen wall...and even his characters title... The Form... are still creppy
B0076NAWWA|5.0|By far the best album that I bought in 2012! Hands down. This is what radio friendly music should sound like! Imagine, a group of musicians that actually know how to play their instruments!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The story was compelling to read. What surprised me was that all of the images that are used are authentic.
0345529057|4.0|Shipment arrived on time. Small tear on box that holds the books, would have given five stars if not for that. But I'm dying to start reading them so I won't bother returning.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Addictive. Need a little skill, no speed required game to play while waiting at the doctor's office, or in my case while our field trip bus broke down and we waited to be rescued? This is it.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Makes it quick and easy to buy what I need via my phone or tablet.  I like the convenience of this.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Classic story of love and selflessness. One you read in high school and then again every few years after. Great gift
B006S01GH2|5.0|Quirky humor, romantic, wonderful cinematography with great acting and a storyline that keeps you entertained from start to finish. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be entertained!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This totally free calculator works just fine. I only used it a few times, but I haven't had a problem. Yes! I would definitely recommend it to a friend or relative.
B003OUXECE|5.0|A really good complement to the game. It helped me understand a lot, especially since everything in-game was so noisy around the tapes that were used to relay the story to the player that I could barely listen to them.<br /><br />I hope they will ask John Shirley to write a story for the world of Columbia from Bioshock Infinite as well.
B0064W639K|5.0|Incredible story of the orgins of Harvey Dent.  You can see huge influences in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.  It really makes Dent's character pop!
B000HF0KXU|4.0|A nice action flick with a surprising twist, good special effects and well-known actors.<br />No waste of time!<br />Also the end is rather untypical for this kind of genre, but interesting.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|improved considerably the image is quite noticeable to me to lack this accessory to enjoy but my dvd, i recommended!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Being paralyzed as a quadriplegic myself I could totally relate to it.  I absolutely love this movie, ranks in my top five for sure.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|It is simply the whole era of Silent Shout gathered in one lush pack that every The Knife must own.
B008KE3960|1.0|This game is not the best game all you do is fly air planes<br /> And you shoot other tanks boring
B0011TMGKG|1.0|I suspect this product might not be genuine. The quality of stitching is very poor compared to other Lamaze products I have bought. Also there is nothing else to this product, no sounds, just a lion that's made poorly. Don't buy from this seller.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Was very pleased with this movie. Enjoyed the twist on the classic story. Would gladly watch this again. You won't be disappointed.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|If you are a DEEP PURPLE fan you are going to be absolutely THRILLED !! The Guys Did It !! After 8 years of waiting for a return to what we knew they could do DEEP PURPLE has put out an EXCELLENT, MUST HAVE, for any Rock-N-Roll Fan. From Track One To Track Twelve it is Highway Music all the way. I MUST say that my favorite song is a tribute to Vincent Price Track Eleven, the song, \\"VINCENT PRICE\\" just rocks and Vincent would just love it !! If the RADIO STATIONS do not pick up on this they are just stupid ! That may be harsh, but I spent over 25 years promoting music, and I know what the masses will like... and DEEP PURPLE'S \\"NOW WHAT?!\\" is it. Even the younger rockers will enjoy this 2 CD ALBUM. YES 2 CD's ! CD One is the music.. CD Two is a DVD interview with DEEP PURPLE, Up Close and Personal and then to add a little KICK ! LIVE CUTS of \\"PERFECT STRANGER\\" ...OH !! MY !! and another LIVE CUT of \\"RAPTURE OF THE DEEP\\" OH !! DEAR !!! Along with a 16 page insert with THE WORDS TO THE SONGS, and PICS OF THE BAND,!!!! And to top it all off ...The guys of DEEP PURPLE dedicated this great CD to the late, great JON LORD. They say his spirit is all through this CD, as his spirit was all through the recording studio in NASHVILLE when it was recorded. This MUST BE an addition to any person that is a great connoisseur of ROCK-N-ROLL !! You will not regret this 2 CD / 3 Fold ! IT IS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN PLATINUM !!! IAN GILLAN -Singer, IAN PAICE - Percussion/Drums, ROGER GLOVER - Bass Guitar, STEVE MORSE - Guitar, DON AIREY - Keyboards, They Are DEEP PURPLE !!!
B008ROELL0|4.0|I love Michael Douglas in this movie!  He portrays someone slipping over the edge so well.  It is a definite good watch
B005FISBTO|5.0|So my review for season 5 was meant for season 6! Season 5 was intense, but season 6 was just a better season all together! Only two more season to go - WHY must it end????
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it it great and funny I would  let my friends know about it and it good and funny and parents it good for kids
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is really well developed, and thought out. I love Star Wars, and I quite like pinball, and the combination of the two makes for an immersive experience. I just can't stop playing this game!
B003MC5N28|5.0|...along with Anthem by Ayn Rand. We must never forget the preciousness of life and need of a person to be an individual.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I really loved this movie. I don't know why it was so controversial. I thought it was funny, and there was lots of flying blood.
0670026603|5.0|You will not be disappointed if you read \\"Me Before You\\".<br />It will make you chuckle and cry. This book, if cast right<br />and directed by the right director will make an excellent movie.<br />I know a book/story is good when the characters become real<br />to me while reading and I miss having to say goodbye when<br />the story finishes. I think you will feel the same if you read<br />this story.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This was one of the better seasons and it went way too fast! Can't wait for season 7! Too bad there won't be more Dex after Season 8  :(  **(This was meant to be the review for season 6!!! - Season 5 was good and the seller was perfect!)**
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I like these books because I watch the TV show and the story line is very close the the show.  I want to read them all and can't wait for the next book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like how it tells you how much battery life is left, that you can personalize color, and add alerts for when the battery is getting low.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read several SEALs books and Fearless is by far the best. I was so taken by his acceptance of Jesus Christ as his Savior. I purchased the hard cover for a nephew who has been battling drug addiction for several years. Guess where the institution is located: Hot Springs, AR.  I believe Fearless will be a powerful tool to help people recover from drug addiction
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I payed money for this app. It worked for a second then crashed. Now it won't let me into the game at all. Total waste of money. 1 star is the lowest I can give on Amazon but it doesn't even deserve that. Terrible.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|So it's just like 20 Questions except it's characters. It really surprised my son and I a few times, too.
B005VPXNV2|1.0|I know everyone's taste in movies are different but If I could rate this movie as a negative star I would.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Not at the same caliber as the original trilogy but it is definitely the strongest of the hobbit trilogy.  As a standalone it is enjoyable and fun to watch.
193700788X|1.0|I am SO desapointed! this is not possible! This end is so empty... COME ON! Nothing to do with the Sookie we know... PLEASE Mrs Harris, make your readers happy: just write another one with all that we like in Sookie: TENSION SEX ERIC (and not Sam! I mean all this is possible!) ETC.<br />Having waited all this time for this... You disappointed me and this is regreatful because it seems that I am not the only one<br />Caroline<br />PS: sorry for the English which is not my native language...
B00498YZH8|5.0|It is a gripping &#34;coming of age&#34; story about a girl who faces the grim facts of her life and decides to do something to take care of her family and herself.  She shows strength and imagination as she meets the many challenges that initially seem  to engulf her.  The performances are stunning.  It's about the only movie I can watch over and over.
0307474259|4.0|Book was slow reading for me. To much like textbook. I have been following diet suggested for 3 months and I have lost 40 lbs. So there is good information if you are following instructions. I have not added exercise to my routine yet. I wanted to lose so weight first. Yes, I do miss elements I eliminated from my diet but I like results more.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|I loves this movie as a kid, watching it again reminded me just how much fun tmnt was! The fact that its live action and not animation makes it just that much better!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Just a sweet fun movie everyone loves.  My 9 year old daughter has been asking, my 10 year old son asks to watch & best pricing on Amazon!
B005PK553C|4.0|American Horror Story Season 1 is pure delight.  Acted by a superb cast and with an ever-evolving story line, it keeps you on the edge of your seat with a story you can't wait to continue, but at the same time hope never ends.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This may not have been as good as some of my favorites (Farscape, for instance) but it is definitely the best \\"post apocalypse\\" earth imagining I've seen in a TV show. Giving us an interesting situation where aliens harness children and the rebel humans are led by a historian.<br /><br />The plot gets a little contrived, which you really can't help and still keep it compelling so no real harm there. However, the show does a great job making us care about the individual characters by giving them good motivations and good dialogue. A good show, and I can't wait to see if it can become a great one.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I knew this was an award winning film, based on a true story, but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Helen Hunt gave an amazing performance, showing such vulnerability in her character, underneath the New England no nonsense demeanor. I was moved to tears by the story and the rare depiction of a profound disability, that was so humanizing and broadly relatable - because many feel they can't find love and connection - who have no disabilities at all. Much more deep than just a story of a sex therapist and her client.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|have fun watching it cause i love the bug infestation. The characters are well made and it look real so i like.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|This one of the best albums on the decade. All songs flow and come together as a whole. Not just a collection of singles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game... very challenging and good exercise for the brain...wouldn't mind more games like this.. it keeps you going you don't want to stop
B0049VZ222|1.0|My boyfriend and I were told that this is a great show by many people so we decided to check it out.  We watched the entire first season, hoping it would get better with each episode.  The acting and dialogue are absolutely terrible. Within each episode, the plot hardly develops at all and certain aspects just drag on. The writers spend way too much time on certain scenarios that don't contribute to the overall plot. We will definitely not be wasting anymore money on this overhyped crap.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast - need I say more.  He never disappoints.  One of the most interesting heroes one can find in detective literature.  Any fan of mystery books need to pick up a Pendergast book beginning with Relic and read all of the catalog.  Do yourself a favor.  You won't be disappointed.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Good movie with a hint of corny jokes. Fight scenes were very well choreographed with a decent story line. I am a little disappointed in the ending but.....that's the direction movies are heading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is what I was looking for forever good thing they lowered the price first it was worldcraft then survival craft now this this is the best game ever
B004FOA84A|4.0|Very interesting game.. I love all hidden object games, especially ones with a story line and you have to figure out what happened
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I really liked all the characters in this book and hope there is a follow up very soon. Great read.
B00B0C6T34|5.0|Swing Out Sister has always delivered excellent music. \\"Incomplete Without You\\" (track 1)  is just one of the favorites I have of the tracks on this CD.
0765325950|4.0|In hindsight, I probably should have gone back and read a few of the previous novels before tackilng this one as I sometimes forgot who some of the members of the cast of characters were.  The book held true to the series, where nothing is ever easy and the enemy proves to be an intelligent foe, albeit with warring egos and motives.<br /><br />The ending wrapped the series up nicely, and as well as you can when &#34;there are no endings&#34; and the Wheel continues to turn.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|It was great worked well and fast delivering. I was thoroughly satisfied with the quality of this movie and it has great quality to watch t.
B008RKGF1I|3.0|I though the movie was very  risque. I also saw the play; good dancers and story line, but again risque.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love killing time by surfing Pinterest! I love the quickness of pulling up this app and scrolling through all the pins.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Movie was fine, but a little odd and just didn't do much for me.  I'm glad I saw it, but wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this series. Firefly was such an amazing series, and I'm sad that it stopped after two seasons. Amazing cast, chemistry is amazing, humour is awesome.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|if you love hair bands you have to have this cd !!! musicly very talented group lyrics also very talented i highly reccomend this band to everyone !!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Well crafted mystery novel that is fast paced and keeps your interest thru the whole book. As good as the other Harry Bosch novels.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I really say, this is facebook. The App works with no real issues. I don't enjoy the landscape view as much but that is just a personal preference.
B006M4F67A|4.0|It's your typical mah jonng game but always fun to play by yourself.  Could have added music to make it<br /> better. Good game!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|great CD and love this music not as great as their old music but for modern music it is great
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|same review as above !! great band and cd !! i highly reccomend this band !! you have to see them live !! great show !!!
0061928356|3.0|The back-and-forth was easy to keep track of since it was chapter by chapter.  I learned much about India.  Felt I was there.  Just could not feel the emotions being described.  Can't really say why.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great app, feel free to use it, also the app is free and very easy to manage wirelessly. The app is user friendly.
B00BVYJG18|4.0|Honestly, Jesse Leach is back in Killswitch Engage with a vengeance. His vocals have improved far beyond the capabilities of what he could do in the previous albums. His voice is alot stronger on clean than they used to be and his growls managed to stay fierce and driven. It was interesting to hear a Howard Jones era Killswitch with Jesse Leach doing the vocals instead. The guitars are amazing as always. The game has been stepped up with this album though compared to their last 2 albums. The drums and bass are also booming and crisp. It doesn't seem to drown out the other instruments/vocals like you hear in some recordings or other bands.<br /><br />There were probably about 2 songs on there that I didn't much care for compared to the rest of it which will explain my 4 stars instead of the 5. I wouldn't change anything about this album though. It's imperfections are what make it a work of art.<br /><br />Buy it. Download it. Do what you have to do to listen to this album.<br /><br />Thank you Howard Jones, for keeping the throne warm while Mr. Leach was away. Both bad ass vocalists in my opinion but ladies and gentlemen, the king is back.
B009NPA3Y6|5.0|I was looking for the new songs and this cd has it all new and old just good old rock
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|When many people feel they have been cheated and deceived, there is something wrong. If you pay for a game, it should be the entire game. Or label your paid game for what it is - a DEMO. I downloaded this game yesterday. I had all 12 restaurants unlocked. That is until this evening when I logged on to discover I now only have 6 of the restaurants unlocked. Oh, if I want it's only another $.99 EACH to unlock the other 5 that did not unlock. This type of deceptive business is why I will never spend my money on any games by this company.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Jackson's part is the ultimate character for SONS.  He has everything from bad ass to handsome.  The rest of the characters finish filling in the family perfectly.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I have aging iMac, with different adapter type connected to a DVI cable, monitor shared between iMac as 2nd monitor and primayr for a White Box computer, which I just re-built.  When it comes time to buys the iMac, will use this cable to create 2nd monitor for MacBook Pro.. it rocks.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I purchased this case about 3 weeks ago.  The charger charges the Voyager Legend headset pretty quickly.  I would estimate that it charges the headset from 2 hours of remaining charge to a full 7 hours of remaining charge in an hour or slightly less.  The case is made of plastic and has 2 indicator lights.  One shows the level of charge of the case and the other shows the level of charge of the headset.  The case protects the headset while it charges.<br /><br />The front cover of the case is made of shaded plastic that is fairly transparent.  My only concern is that the front cover will get scratched while it is in your pocket or a travel bag.  After 3 weeks it has not proved to be an issue.  Even if it did get scratched, this would only be a small cosmetic issue.  The case is very durable as far as protecting the headset is concerned.  The only reason I am mentioning this is because I have a Plantrontics 975 headset that comes with a charging case that has a leather/leather-like exterior in contrast to this case.<br /><br />One of the most important things to me is the ease of placing the headset into the charging case.  The magnetic charging portion of the headset is attracted to and quickly connects to the charger portion of the case.  While some people have complained in the reviews of the headset about the change of connectors from the micro usb in the prior headset (the Voyager Pro) to the magnetic connector in the Voyager Legend, I have a different opinion.  I had 2 Voyager Pro headsets that became unusable after less than a year due to a problem with the charging connector in the headset.  After a while I would plug the charging cord into the headset and the unit would just fail to charge and the charging light would not go on.  The change in the connector from the Voyager Pro to the Voyager Legend may be a result of this type of problem.  This Voyager Legend case always connects without a problem.  I enjoy the ability to quickly charge the headset while out of the house and office and the protection that the case provides.  I highly recommend this case.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|For anything you look up, it gives you on depth responses. I like it. It is like a giant brain.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game. I like it so far on my Kindle Fire. I can not wait to see how the mystery unfolds.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I am a twenty year vet, and I still love reading this book from this book from time to time. If you want to become a chance we chef, read this first!
1250007208|5.0|Cinder was a surprising read for me, I had heard a lot about the book but didn't pick it up because I am not a big fan of classic fairy tales being retold. I finally decided to give it a try when it came out in paperback and read it right away and what a read it was! The book is a really quick read and flows really well. The characters are well developed and I fell in love with Cinder, Peony and Iko!  Iko has to be my favorite supporting character in a book since Dobby, I loved every scene she was in.<br /><br />The evil stepmother was just that, evil. She was just one of the villains in the book and was really well written. The other villain is Queen Levana. She is the perfect villain and has the potential to become a classic villain.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the reading the rest of the series! 4.5/5 Stars<br /><br />PS. The sequel, Scarlet, is out now!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love the show.  Can watch it with the kids. They love it too. Totally addictive. Start with season one and you'll see what I mean. Enjoy ;)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great app and easy to use. 4 stars because sometimes my reading plan goes back to day 1 and the calendar wont load. exiting and trying again usually fixes it!
0760703329|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my son and he hasn't put it down..just keeps re-reading it. Beautifully bound and very well made.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Stop wondering if you should buy this and just do it. You'll notice an instant improvement on your pictures every time you use this. I held out for a year wondering if I should buy the SB-400 or a larger speed light, and I was given this as a gift. I wish I had it years ago! All of my indoor shots of birthday parties, Christmas mornings and other family memories would have turned out so much better if I had this! The bigger flashes are just bigger. This little guy does everything you need.
014241493X|3.0|This was my first John Green book and I picked it because I liked how the plot sounded and people raved about all of his books, but boy was I disappointed! I didn't really enjoy any of the characters and the plot kept going in circles for me and it ended with a conclusion that fell quite flat for me. I enjoyed the road trip part of the book but since it didn't last too long and it wasn't a major part of the book I couldn't rated the book any higher than a 2.5.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the book was Margo Speigelman, this girl does not seem to care about anyone but herself. I didn't care about why she was screwed up or how she got that way. I really didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with her or do any of the things she did with Q and to top it all off was the ending of the book and Q's reaction.<br /><br />Overall, I regretted reading Paper Towns because it was really the worst book I have read in years but I won't give up on John Green just yet. 2.5/5 Stars
B003H4I4JU|5.0|There is definitely a different tone to this novel. it is much more mature in its plot than Enders Game. Although still easy to read, there is more content to think about and relate to than the first novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There's so much excitement and action. I can't stop reading and just want to know what's going to happen next.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|It didn't stop the ads when playing the games even after reboot.  They still popped up making it annoying trying to play your game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought me of all people would be so interested in a zombie show, but the writers are so creative and the storyline isn't predictable like most of these types of shows. 5 stars all the way, I can't wait for the next season to begin!
B005VC4FLW|5.0|Definitely a great rental for date night or a girls night!  It contains all the necessary components for a great story:  great performances, story line, and a little twist thrown in at the end.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Better than FB when you don't want all the ads or bull crap out there. Love it for sure. Thanks.
1742200508|4.0|We just returned from two weeks in southwest England and had a chance to put this one to the test.<br /><br />The LP guide is reasonably comprehensive and suitable for general planning.  We thought the best sections were those outlining commonly-visited sites, which you can use to prioritize potential visits -- once you arrive you can fill in the blanks with local tourist boards or talking with locals. The weakest sections were on opening and closing times (not always accurate), and the rather brief index. The sections on accommodations and dining seemed good but may be quickly outdated, since the ownership/competition/prices/staff may change frequently, and the authors' experiences may not reflect yours.  Of course, \\"comprehensive\\" means \\"heavy and bulky,\\" so if you are visiting a small area, you may want to cut out sections or use an e-book (if you can navigate through one).<br /><br />How does it compare to other guides?  We briefly scanned sections from other travel guides for the areas we visited, and found LP to be relatively accurate, although no travel guide we found will be complete -- your best travel guide is probably a four-fold combination of advice from several different travel guides, information from local tourist boards,some internet searches, and discussions with travelers who have visited the area you plan to visit. You will find some excellent resources once you arrive in Britain.<br /><br />Would we use it again?  Yes, but as a planning guide.  We found we rarely used it once we arrived in the country because the info you will get from tourist boards and locals were more up to date and comprehensive -- again, a travel guide is sort of a \\"90%-of-the-way-there\\" guide rather than the only resource you can rely on. Hope you can use this good LP Travel Guide to plan an enjoyable visit to this fascinating land.
193700788X|1.0|I for one did like the start of the book and the use of the third person. However, from the moment the story switched back to Sookie and resumed a recount of the same inconsistencies, insecurities and whining ms. Harris plagued us with last time, I sort of lost interest.<br />I bought the audiobook, btw. Although I have loved Joanna Parker's work in the past, this time I found myself getting irritated by the 'breathlessness'/ 'hoarseness' in her/Sookie's voice (if you know what I mean). I'm not sure if the problem was the narrator or the novel itself. I just wanted it to stop. So that's what I did. I pushed stop, returned the audiobook (thank Audible for the prompt service!) and never looked back.<br /><br />I don't blame the writer as much as myself. We all saw it coming after the last book, didn't we? Anyway, got my credit back.<br /><br />Things I liked: The first few paragraphs, the third person<br />Things I didn't: The whining. The storyline felt convoluted and forced. The characters seemed to lack depth. Their actions seemed.. well.. out of character..<br />All in all, Crappy end to a series that was already going down the toilet.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I remember seeing the trailer for it but never got the chance to see it in the theater. Well worth watching!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|this game is horrible you have to buy something to get rid of adds it, is just a waste . of your money and time
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Great read and surprisingly good.  Fun reading something so entertaining from the 19th century. Interesting culturally. The original Count D!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Rarely has a classic book been such a fun, swift read for me.<br /><br />It's especially nice to read on a Kindle, as the dictionary feature comes in quite handy for the unfamiliar words that appear rather frequently.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very fun game and very beautiful  easy to play and the kids learn about sealife  we just got back from disneyland so this game is very exciting for my granddaughters
B006YC74E8|5.0|For Free!  Just as good as any other Camera that cost..I thought I was only going to be able to use skype on this thing..This one is free and works on my Kindle Fire HD Just fine..Thank you for the free app.
193700788X|5.0|I was happy with the conclusion of the book series... In a way, it felt right. With Sookie ending up with Sam, she gets all the things she's always wanted. She said over and over that she NEVER wanted to a vampire and she never acted as if she wanted to live forever. I loved Eric and Bill's character but forever was not in the cards for those relationship. She could not fully true either of them. Sookie would be able to have a full life with Sam. It was a good ending.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Charlaine Harris writes next. I love her writing style.<br /><br />This being said, For HBO's True Blood, I really want Eric and Sookie to get back together and stay that way!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|A great movie that shows the struggle and determinjation of a horse and how in the times of war things happen. Great ending
B0036TGT3E|5.0|You have to have to own this movie if you grew up with it and you have children as well. My son absolutely loves it.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|this is gritty old fashioned in your face rock and roll.  these tunes get in your head and rattle around like the great &#34;hair bands&#34; of the 80's.  great great stuff to rock out with, or sing your heart out with the power ballads.  The whole album composition is terrific....not just one or two songs to love and ignore / fast forward thru the rest...this is an album to play over and over.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive to its core and doesn't dissapoint with 450 levels for free. No competition in the puzzle genre. VERY GOOD BUY
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|I listen it 5 times enough is enough. Mellow catchy forgettable rock stuff.  Jon's voice is gone, Richie why are you doing this, when you sounded so superb in your solo albums even the last one. Probably Richie should take up BJ vocals. CD does not have lyrics does not matter, Jon has compromised his writings. I still eat breath and die listening to Keep the Faith n These Days. Now I m thinking twice should I fly from Malaysia to Melbourne to watch them this December. As from the album, buy it as a collectors item and let it die in dust. My advise to Jon for being a New Jersey guy, please go buy Bruce Springsteen We Take Care of Our Own. Man is 63, but he does not compromise. That's how you make music.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|It's a very low-key quiet movie. It makes me feel content. Other babies would probably enjoy watching this! :) :)
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|I watched it twice.  The second time I watched it with subtitles.  There was some dialog that was a little hard to heard-understand, mostly from either filming outside or due to the dialog being j. English (American)
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Do no get if you have a kindle fire or kindle fire hd it won't work. No gameloft game will work on kindle fire or kindle fire hd I've tried 2 other games of theirs.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|So cute and so funny. The whole family enjoyed it. This is wonderful family-time movie. Sure to get a laugh.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Really enjoyed Follett's 2nd in the series. Fast moving pace that grabs your attention and keeps it for the duration of the novel. Looking forward to the follow up
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|The album is phenomenal and Erykah Badu isnt.  I can listen to it over and over again, Bonobo music is genius!
B0097K21YW|3.0|Cute animation and fun concept add up to an enjoyable Angry Birds-ish game. If you like the a fore mentioned game you may well enjoy this.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is a great show!! I love the whole series and it tells a lot about different supernatural things that happens all around the world or even just myths.  Love it
B005LAII80|5.0|My expectations were low, but this movie blew me away. Great story, fx, and 3D. Just heard they may come out with another.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game!, it is the best zoo. Game I have found. A must try its free what do you have. To loose?
193700788X|1.0|I was not expecting much from this book as the last few were almost unreadable. This series lost it's luster about 3 books back. I also did not expect Sookie to end up with whom I wanted. However, CH could have done a much better job giving Sookie's romantic fanbases some closure. You cannot please everyone, but at least make the ending not seem as if it came out of nowhere. Or better yet as if it was written by someone else with no real interest or feel for the characters.<br />Everything seemed to be rushed, with as little thought or imagination  put into it as possible. I think that CH lost interest in the series a long time ago but was continuing with it only for the sake of squeezing as much money out of the franchise as possible. Sadly, for me, this has hurt her reputation as a writer. One must know when to call it quits and that was about three books ago.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great Movie great price non stop action complex plot sprinkled with humor.  I cant wait for the next movie release.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for next season. Watched all three seasons between Netflix, hulu, and amazon within 2 weeks. Was out of work taking care of my son who had the flu. Couldn't hang out with him and get sick too :-)
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|It was an unexpected read. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. For over the age of 40 plus readers. I think!!!!
B000J103PC|5.0|Loved it,  and would recommend it to anyone who liked Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep and Fashions, not just in the US but in Paris.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved it but think the first one was the best. It is a little sad but other than that it is a really good book about a seventeen year old girl who's on fire and saving the world from evil president Snow.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  Not just about zombies.  The story of the survivors is terrifying and heartbreaking, and leaves me on the edge of my seat.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Acting not the best, but this is an fairly interesting program that I would recommend you give it a try.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is very fun<br />kind of addictive<br />I enjoy playing this game a lot<br />so glad it was free
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|awesome debute album. arrived before estimated date.  product was also in very good condition.  totally worth the purchase. i u like this, check out Riot! from paramore
0684857219|5.0|Awesome Book. If you are serious with working out all of your body. This book helps you out big time
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Terrific book. First in a series I believe. Davidbaldacci never disappoints but he's added another hero to join Oliver Stone.
B006G2124E|5.0|If you want to laugh and cry, pop this movie in your DVD player or download it to your tablet.  Excellent performances, and they told a great, and sometimes very funny story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wife read this book and said parts of it were very intense and some were strange but all & all it was really good.
1451695195|5.0|As a nurse I have heard many near death experiences of patients.<br />It was fascinating to hear one from a neurosurgeon.  He understands<br />how the brain works, and suffered a brain injury.  His experience was thought provoking and I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.
0525953728|5.0|This is an excellent read. It is well written, honest, and provides a lot of interesting material. The information about the killing of Osama is clinical. It has little political commentary but a lot of information on how SEAL Teams work. Very good.
B000XXTCF8|5.0|To the DJs of the world--we love Van Morrison, but Brown Eyed Girl is not the only record he made.  I got this mainly to get Domino, which I love and pretty much never hear otherwise.  And a lot of other great stuff is on the album too.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|This review is not about the content.  The KINDLE version of the 4-book set is really annoying.  I would get the 4 separate books and save yourself some grief. I don't know what is wrong with this but it takes FOREVER to do a search to find a name.  Since that is one of the things I use a lot in ebooks, I found it especially annoying that I couldn't search, especially in a series with a zillion characters.  There was a time I let the search go for over 10 minutes and I still never got to the place I was looking for.  The other thing that was bad about the KINDLE version is that every time I went to the book from elsewhere on the device it would look like it loaded right away, then it suddenly turned off again to \\"think\\" for many seconds at a time.  Since I go back and forth between books and other things on my device this got really wearing after the first few times.  This happened every time I wanted to read.  So if you are thinking of getting this 4-book set then you'd be much better off with the individual volumes.<br /><br />OK one thing about the series.  It is rambling on with no destination that is apparent to the reader.  I hope I am wrong about this and that the author actually has a plan for ending the series, but when I heard that there is going to be a 6TH book and maybe even a 7TH book I started thinking I am going to give up on this series.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A riveting account of the 'melt down' and what precipitated it.  Full of details which lay out a clear line to accountability.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book aloud to my wife. We both enjoyed the trilogy. This book is very entertaining and will keep you wanting more. The character development becomes more complex with the story line in this book. It sets the stage for the final book. The book will keep you guessing who are the good guys, who are the bad guys and who is in love with who.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very well written. Excellent characters. Amazing story line. Read the whole series. Read it before the movie and felt book definitely better than movie, although I did enjoy the movie.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I barely started this volume, but I have to agree with most of the people who are wondering where the editing is, and why this 4 book series has become a for sure 6 book and a rumored 7 book series.  It does not give me confidence that the author has a plan for ending the series.<br />But the man critique I have is for the KINDLE edition.  There is something seriously wrong with the type sizing.  It is either way too tiny or giant.  Nothing in between.  For the amount of money I paid for this thing, I expect that technologically it should be PERFECT.  So you might want to try the paper copy which at least has a readable font size and is going to be way cheaper in paper back.
0812982622|5.0|Not since The Orchid Thief have I come across a book so remarkably creative.  Its detail into daily life in North Korea borders on the anthropological. How much of the back story is fiction or fact?  The fact I wasn't sure, made this all the more diabolical.<br /><br />I marveled at the manner in which seemingly innocuous conduct was interpreted as a malignancy to be excised by torture.  I marveled at the manner in which otherwise benign acts were interpreted as treasonous in nature.  I marveled at how something as common as a barbecue put on by Americans could be interpreted as an intentional act of humiliation.  And I marveled at the ability of the author to imagine and give a voice to such things.<br /><br />Equally incredible was the gratuitous torture not to mention the the fucundity of blood bags (I will not explain). Also incredible were the kidnapping expeditions, the coded language between family members, the feigned shark attack, the daily lectures that were broadcast through speakers mounted in the streets, hallways and inside homes.  Again, are these and other things exaggeration or malignant truth?  The genius of this book is that it rests on the tension of that unanswered question to weave a tale of survival, redemption and suspense.<br /><br />Our nemesis, Pak Jun Do e.g., the Orphan Masters Son is an unlikely hero.  He is not particularly remarkable.  He is neither driven nor ambitious, nor is he particularly cruel even though he does cruel things.  As a child he dictates the fate of numerous orphans who serve no purpose other than to be conscripted to life-threatening factory work.  As a soldier he kidnaps Japanese and as an intelligence officer he twists the truth to suit Korean objectives to place others in harms way.  It is not until he finds himself as a unwitting pawn in a diplomatic mission to the United States that he rises to the occasion to find truth and perspective, after which, for reasons not apparent, he ends up in a work camp so brutal it defies credulity.  Improbably, he escapes, assumes the identity of one of the greatest sociopaths in the North Korean political hierarchy and rises to the occasion, only to discover honor, love and redemption, privileges beyond the realm of his station not to mention the dreams of an Orphan Master's Son.<br /><br />There's an awful lot to recommend here.  The rendering of North Korean society seemed at once satirical if not outright funny, but for the fact the tyranny is very real.  The power of this book is that despite outrageous if not appalling societal constructs difficult to apprehend, they felt authentic.<br /><br />Also, while Pac Jun Do doesn't have much of an internal life, his actions inform him and so too the reader. It is because of his very unremarkability that somewhere along the line one comes to appreciate that despite his past, he has lived a life of compassion, humility and grace, such that the reader finds himself rooting for this anti-hero and with him the hope that the rest of North Korea will follow.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book.  It is moving, thought-provoking, frightening, suspenseful, horrifying, funny, brilliant, redemptive, hopeful, deeply satisfying and all of these things at once. I cannot recommend it highly enough.l it defies credulity.  Improbably, he escapes, assumes the identity of one of the greatest sociopaths in the North Korean political hierarchy and rises to the occasion, only to discover honor, love and redemption, privileges beyond the realm of his station not to mention the dreams of an Orphan Master's Son.<br /><br />There's an awful lot to recommend here.

The power of this book is that despite outrageous if not appalling societal constructs difficult to apprehend, they felt authentic.<br /><br />Also, while Pac Jun Do doesn't have much of an internal life, his actions inform him and so too the reader. It is because of his very unremarkability that somewhere along the line one comes to appreciate that despite his past, he has lived a life of compassion, humility and grace, such that the reader finds himself rooting for this anti-hero and with him the hope that the rest of North Korea will follow.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book.  It is moving, thought-provoking, frightening, suspenseful, horrifying, funny, brilliant, redemptive, hopeful, deeply satisfying and all of these things at once. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0470913029|5.0|If you want to jump start your weight loss read this book and within one to two weeks you will start taking off some pounds.  After following this regime (not a diet) I immediately felt better and my knee pain went away.  I said to myself \\"Oh my God, it must have been all the sweets as well as all the fast foods I was eating.  The book is easy to read and understand. Try it, it's worth two weeks of giving up the bad foods to see how you feel.
1401302378|3.0|This book makes an important albeit, perhaps, obvious point. It is something that most people younger than a certain age instinctively understand.<br />The long tail in the age of Internet is a model where abundance and endless variety is available and can be found and filtered. Costs being near zero this long tail of goods - although the book clearly focuses on music and film - is a revenue stream equal to or superior to the head, which in mainstream parlance is the hits or what is available in a typical retail outlet. The book was initially instigated when author Chris Anderson, who at the time edited Wired magazine, was meeting with someone at a company called Ecast and was surprised to find how deep the sales `tail' extended. That is, how much obscure titles sold in aggregate. Also, the title of the book stems from the type of curve representing powerlaws an example of which is linguist George Zipf's observations on frequency of words' usage (and many other things). Note: clearly an obscure product would not sell as much as a well-publicized or mainstream one, but in total the sum of available non-mainstream `long tail' products would match or surpass their better-known cousins. Now imagine a business (on the net) that can supply an infinite choice to its customers not constrained by what page 94 calls the \\"tyranny of the shelf.\\"<br />Incidentally, and as an aside, pages 90 and 91 taught me that there are no atoms in bits - something I had believed was unimaginable. The author makes mention of how one can reduce atoms to zero as well as getting rid of atoms. I didn't know what to make of it and had to ponder the physical reality of it.<br /><br />Here are the secrets to the Long Tail business:<br />1- Make Everything Available<br />2- Help Me Find It<br /><br />Don't panic. In the model described costs are near zero. Traditional economics are placed on its head. As the author reminds us economics is the science of scarcity, but while many things like money and time remain scarce the shelf space or incremental cost of the net are approaching a cost of zero.<br />The principles are focused on CD (music) and DVD (film) likely because it is still the dawn of Internet and the available data is limited. Still, at the book's end there is a perfunctory attempt to go beyond the aforementioned markets. Having said that, still half the non-music and film examples are Internet-related. What is more, likely partly due to the data and the industry and partly due to the author's location the data, if not the conclusions, is US-centric. It is still universally applicable but Yahoo, Rhapsody, Netflix are all USA-based. These are several of the main companies the author cites as case studies.<br />Anderson thinks that this model not only supports his central thesis, but also proclaims the end of the era of central command and control. Not so fast, he should check who owns most of these Internet bits and bytes assets. The answer is the same moguls and conglomerates that own everything else. More importantly, the medium is now the centre. Never mind. He makes a point about fragmented and decentralized micro niches being the end of hits and the mainstream.<br />The concept discussed is really a simple and observable one that the author takes to in detail. Occasionally it is inarticulate and occasionally it is self-servingly elongated. Ultimately, it is not improbable to see how it could have been an article (in Wired magazine?) or a Blog post (which it once was) given its data, theme and conclusion.<br />Finally, I bet former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is misquoted from the company's first shareholder's meeting where he did not say, \\"we were able to capture very large and historically undeserved businesses...\\" or perhaps he was not!ime remain scarce the shelf space or incremental cost of the net are approaching a cost of zero.<br />The principles are focused on CD (music) and DVD (film) likely because it is still the dawn of Internet and the available data is limited.

0307887448|2.0|Truly, Ready Player One is a novel of great avant-garde style. It is unique and explores a realm of literature previously untouched by other great literary works. Dystopian novels are commonplace. But Ready Player One adds another level to this dystopian concept that separates it from other books of its genre. For one, the unique premise assumes that the public sector has collapsed and the world revolves around a global Internet role-playing game. Players can escape from the everyday struggles of humanity and essentially live in a world where they can be anything from a mermaid to an ogre.<br /><br />But despite its unique premise, Ready Player One is lackluster. It is a disappointing read. To be blunt, it is quite boring.  One can divide the story into 3 parts - one for each key that the protagonist needs to find in order to win an important online contest that the book is centered on. The journey to the first key is quite remarkable and unique, incorporating nostalgic moments of the 1980s into the plot. But as the plot moves on, the story stiffens. It has no movement, no other direction. The only direction it goes in is a straight, ordered, predictable path - the protagonist finds all keys and saves the world (quite a cliché ending for a book with an interesting premise).<br /><br />Furthermore, the style of writing itself is very mediocre. The author, Ernest Cline, does not employ a unique writing style. It is very direct, quite in contrast to other novels I have read. Little or no figurative language is used, with the positive aspects of the novel only being carried by its unique premise. Only from this premise do the novel's strong points shine. For example, the romantic relationship between Wade and Art3mis is an aspect of the opaqueness of Internet communication, a factor that is greatly tied to the premise of the story. Overall, the book was a disappointment. It was unique at first glance, but became a predictable novel with little literary merit.
1451697686|5.0|Bea's book is an incredible inspiration!  I so appreciate that she has shared exactly HOW to strive toward a more waste-free life.  She addresses every single issue I could think of and even more than I had considered in this book.  The tone is encouraging and never preachy.  She has radically changed her own family's values and decision making processes and knows where most of us are coming from.  I have used Bea's experience and advice (from her blog) over the past year and a half to decrease my family's waste significantly.  All of that information and more is here in this book.  It works!  My only wish is that there had been more pictures in this book.  Her home and organization are lovely, clean and inspiring.  My daughter calls it the \\"Zero-Waste Challenge\\".  I think that's a good way to put it, because I can keep challenging myself every day and not have to feel like a failure when I do make a little trash.  I think Bea would concur.

1400069742|3.0|This is a book which is easy to read, as the narrative flows nicely.  However, when all is said and done, one is left with an incomplete picture of the time.  The wide-ranging motivation of the various isolationist movements simply is not given its due.  It is simply easier for Olson to reduce this to an FDR vs. Lindbergh proposition, with a sprawling cast of supporting characters.  Even when Lindbergh disappears from the narrative (and this happens frequently), the reader is left feeling that Olson is struggling to push the story back in Lindbergh's direction.  Agree or disagree with the various beliefs of the isolationists, one needs to give them their day in court, and it simply doesn't happen here.<br /><br />I am also troubled by the lack of original research here.  Olson lists an assortment of archives and collections in her bibliography, but her citations lean heavily on secondary sources, even to the extent that she quotes the historians upon whom she depends in the text itself, as though this were some sort of seminar paper written by a graduate student.  A good example would be Harry Hopkins; anyone who has read [[ASIN:0199891958 The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler]], very recently published, knows that a treasure trove of primary sources have recently come available.  However, Olson still relies heavily on Sherwood's 64-year-old study, still useful but indisputably out-of-date.  Taking this approach leaves a researcher at the mercy of those researchers who have gone before, and this is a risky proposition.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, but it comes up so short of its goals that ultimately it feels like a let-down.

B003TOMAPC|2.0|I'm a big fan of the movie, so picking it up on Blu-ray for the discounted price was a no brainer. However, the practice of movie studios putting an expiration date on the digital copy of the film (one that is still available for purchase on iTunes I might add) is ridiculous. The code for the digital copy expired and Lionsgate will do nothing to resolve the situation. So the above rating is for the product not the movie. Not being able to gain access to an included feature just makes me feel cheated, regardless of the price. I'm going to keep the product because it was such a good price for the Blu-ray/DVD copies of the film, but this practice of the digital copies expiring is a reprehensible business practice that should be outlawed. It's for this reason that I either get movies through Netflix or buy them at a discount. One day these companies will smarten up and realize that all these type of draconian business practices do is alienate their customers.

B0000508U6|5.0|I believe Coldplay has to be my favorite band. Big shocker, huh? This album is a great start to their career. While not my most favorite album of theirs, there is something very powerful about listening to a band's roots, their lesser produced music that has a more organic and rough feeling to it. It brings you back to the time when they themselves were figuring out their role in the music industry, before they became one of the biggest bands in the world. Powerful indeed.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It was good until it stopped working, was forced to delete it, and sitting here stuck starting all over again. Whoever reads this...be warned.

0425252868|5.0|This book is a well written and an exciting account of the events of two pilots in WWII.  The aerial combats scenes<br />are very detailed and actually seemed to put one in the pilot's seat or gunner's station.  The background information<br />about the fraternity of German aces is outstanding, as is their resistance to the Nazi party and devotion to their country and a higher call in the midst of a cruel war.  I recommend it highly!
B008220BP2|4.0|This movie was really awesome and I am not the biggest fans of zombie movie but this one actually really good.  It didn't have 3D, which I am happy it didn't, the love story was cute, it was funny with some rom-com thrown in.  Never thought I would say rom-com and zombies in the same sentence lol.  But please make an effort to buy this movie or rent it, I assure you, you will enjoy it!

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Just Finished reading my first David Baldacci Book. I was not sure what to think at first, the opening scenes were not overly written, instead they showed a calm and interesting character doing extraordinary things. I did like the intrigue and the characters introduced, I also like that the character is flawed and doesn't always make the best decisions. In this book the main character is a government sanctioned hitman that finds himself questioning a hit. This starts off a chain events that pairs him with a smart but scared teenager in a desperate situation. The story gives a plausible reason why these two are paired and the design is really quite smart. The only thing I did not really like is the foreshadowing that basically told me why this was going on, instead of letting me figure this out. The overall book was good look forward to reading more from this author.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another hit for DB. A fast paced DC based thriller. Will Robie is a character with staying power. Highly recommend you get this book
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie mostly because the acting was sharp. Jennifer Lawrence played the character of Tiffany perfectly. Love Cooper and DeNiro, as always. For the most part, the film stayed true to the book.<br /><br />What I felt fell short of a flawless film was the ending. Instead of staying on the themes of coping with mental illness and developing the complexities of the characters, the film starts shifting into a romantic comedy, which really irritated me. The book conveys a complex relationship between Pat and Tiffany, but the ending of the movie almost turns it into a saccharine, formulaic romantic comedy.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth watching.

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series although I was nearly ready to give up on it when Robert Jordan passed away.  He did a wonderful job and Branden Sanderson's completion of the story melded seamlessly with Robert Jordan's work.  If you like long complex stories, this series is a good read for you.

B0015DWJX2|4.0|The emotional impact of this novel would have been greater, if I had not recently watched the BBC production of Island at War.  The author's use of letters to tell the story of life in the conquered Channel Islands during WWII was effective in bringing together the experiences that each character had during that sad period of history.  It is a story of human kindness, endurance, and creativity under difficult circumstances. There is also a modern love story which wraps up the narrative in a way which leaves the reader saying, &#34;Yes, of course&#34;
B00BUVLQNI|5.0|After watching the first season on Netflix I expected to go on to the next season.  I was very disappointed to find Netflix did not have seasons 2 and 3 available.

I cannot wait for season 4 to be available.  I will definitely order it as soon as possible. If you love this type of period sagas; then this is the one to see!

I first went to iTunes, but they were charging an arm and a leg (later realized they purposely list the HD price first, with a tiny option for regular video virtually hidden) so I checked out Amazon. Not only did Amazon list the regular vid price first (with HD option secondary) but I can stream the video onto my ps3, rather than download the files onto my computer, only to be tossed later to free up memory. Woohoo! I am thrilled to pieces and will be purchasing more T.V shows in the future.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I don't use any phone now without downloading swift key to use as a primary keyboard. Best after market keyboard available hands down.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I've watched this movie 6 times in 5 days and even sang to \\"That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates\\" song and recited Riddles In The Dark Scene, between Gollum and Bilbo. I love it that much - 'Nuff Said, right?
B0083P1QUM|2.0|SHE HAs done better.  too many procedural details & not enuf action in her latest books which were much better
B0095P31L6|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie. However, although it is a cartoon, it is not for children. The themes and humor are too mature.
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|Shes got a great voice but on most of these songs it isn't showcased well.  A lot of the songs on the album have a very elementary feel with the lyrics and even the melodies.  I felt like i was listening to Radio Disney.  Demi is a little too old to be pushing the cute little girl songs at this point in her career.  Especially with her new rocker girl look.  I still enjoyed the album for entertainment.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I remember watching this when I was younger, I had always loved it and my mom does too. I still love, even though the green screen and fake props do annoy me because that is how I am, but I still love it. Being an 80s movie, it definitely doesn't disappoint &lt;3
B005I7G3EM|5.0|I have watched this movie more times than I can count.  It has great scenery.  It has a comfortable feel like you are a part of the group.  The action is good.  The acting may be a little week but it is just a great entertainment piece.  I will likely watch it again in the future.  The music score is also great and contributes to the overall experience of the move.  It would be even better on a large screen TV.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It kept my interest throughout and had a lot of plausible action.  It was really fun to watch.  I liked it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this app I used to have it in my ipod touch but then I becamed a kindle fan and I love it it is awesome in my kindle fire hd 7
B000P0J0EW|4.0|It's small, I should have ordered a larger one.<br />I ordered it for my husband and he likes it very much.
B00992CF6W|4.0|So if u get it u will be wondering were are all the creepers it's kind of scary if u turn around and there is a creeper and I did it at night I was looking around for a creeper and I didn't see any so I was hurting a cow and I herd a plop  and I turned around and I saw a creeper IT WAS SO SCARY it exploded and I was so scared I left the app like so quick! So if u get the app be ready to turn around and be scared than u will ever be BELIEVE ME ITS SO SCARY!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am in love with this series. I could not put it down. It left me wanting so much more.  Great read!!!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Artistic license, but probably the best historical miniseries on TV. Fabulous acting, wonderful sets, fantastic costuming, intrigue, violence, sex, handsome men, beautiful women, you name it. And for once the actual Borgias were probably even worse than portrayed in the series. Each episode leaves the viewer hanging, lusting for more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing book that made my heart melt page after page!  This book it now my all time favorite! I am so glad I read this book!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Nice read plot was not given away early. Looking forward to reading more of Harry Bosch series from Michael Connelly!
B00001W9G0|5.0|Brings back memories of when this movie first came out and we all had to see it, and then see it again. Streisand's fiery activist plays well against Redford's easy-going man of privilege. Very watchable even now.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Really good. I loved the suspense. I love Ky in this book. In this first book I thought he was quiet and shallow. But turns out he's awesome and deep. He has a story that I could never have.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|This was an accidental discovery that I am really glad I made. I was browsing Rolling Stone reviews when I saw the one on Bugg's debut CD. It intrigued me, so I went to YouTube where I found several of his videos. I was immediately enthralled.<br /><br />You definitely hear influences from early Bob Dylan and the Beatles (post Hard Days Night), but the overall influence is the Merseybeat era (listen closely though and you will hear an homage or two to Woody Guthrie). Jake Bugg is a great story teller as well as an accomplished folk guitar player. At just 19, his songs are filled with adolescent angst and ennui, but delivered unpretentiously and with amazing melodies. Bugg doesn't have the emotional depth that Bob Dylan had upon his debut, but clearly we can expect to be hearing plenty more from this young man.<br /><br />The highlights of this recording include the opener \\"Lightning Bolt,\\" followed by \\"Two Fingers,\\" which has a catchy anthemic refrain. \\"Trouble Town\\" is another venture down the sometimes-violent reality of working class youth in northern England, but not as grisly as the picture painted in \\"Seen It All.\\" And then there's the haunting \\"Broken,\\" where Bugg's vocal range broadens and the emotion comes straight from the gut.<br /><br />They're all good songs. There isn't a throw-away among the bunch. Why only 4 stars rather than 5? Because I know he can write something even better than this. I am anxious to hear what he records next.
B005LAII62|4.0|I watched this movie with grandchidren. We all enjoyed it.  Service ok. What else do you want me to say. I refuse to do another one of these as long as I am required to write a certain amount of words
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|I (had) read the book on paper (old style, ain't it?) and loved it, but than offered it as a gift (in fact, I bought it in Kindle version just because I wanted to have a copy of my own that I could read again and again any time). Well, it seems to work its magic on Kindle as well - what about it? ;)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game presents small challenges and keeps the kids busy! They really love this game! I would recommend this to others!
193700788X|4.0|I'd read so many bad reviews on Amazon about Dead Ever After. But I was surprised that I liked the book so much. It was a good end to a mostly-good series and wrapped things up well. I loved seeing some of the \\"older\\" characters that we haven't seen for quite a while. Ever since the start of \\"True Blood\\" (which I didn't like at all), I've felt like Ms. Harris' writing was geared to the tv characters' personalities, and not to the characters we knew in the earlier books. I think this book brings us back to earlier times and I liked that. Thanks to Ms. Harris for a wonderful series that I've enjoyed so much over the years.
B00138D1I6|1.0|Rip off it is not the full song that it claimed to be.I was so disappointed with my purchase. Do not waste your time or money.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I find more and more practical uses for this application that I loaded on our Kindle Fire.  I consider it extremely easy to use.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I absolutely love this game works great on my kindle fire HD have had no issues what so ever and it's a great way to pass the time as well
B00006F83Y|4.0|Pretty cool CD.  Like Queens, esp. when former Nirvana drummer was on the percussion.  Some pieces better than others.  Enjoy
B000SVZIGC|4.0|I recommend this movie. Not only does is it entertaining but it also explains the Russian revolution. It is a great movie to watch to teach your children history.
B001AW156U|1.0|I purchased these to use when playing COD games to help with grenades, but the darn things just won't stay on.
B004S49YEM|5.0|Fantastic story  well written keeps up the suspence I do not wish to review anymore  I do not wish to review anymore I do not wish to review anymore Please stop asking me to review stories pay somebody to do it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really didn't think I would like reading a book on my phone, but this is great.  It's a very good app.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I JUST LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME IT IS VERY RELAXING AND GOOD EXCERISE FOR THE EYES. I'D RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES PEACEFUL GAMES TO PLAY.
0785162348|5.0|I bought this for an Avengers fan and they loved it.  It is nice and heavy and definitely looks expensive.  I cannot speak to the contents as this was a gift, but I would say it makes a very nice gift.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It's perfect just wish I could sync this app. I love it so much! Use it in class, work, church and self notes.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|I recommend this book to all.  Good story telling.  a good book to keep referring back to time and time again
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm not really a musical type of guy but this movie surprised me and it is inspirational.<br />I can't say that I can watch it again but definitely recommend everyone to watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game!  When I first played it, it felt harder than the first Temple Run but after a while, you realize it's so much better!  I recommend to all who loved Temple Run!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Very different from Ender's Game but a nice and fulfilling development of Ender's character.  I love it every time I read it.
B00BW2LX74|4.0|I've loved him for decades, both solo and as a member of Little Village.  This is a really solid Hiatt album, which is saying quite a bit: solid songs, tremendous lyrics, a strong bluesy feel.  He sounds to me the way I always wish Tom Waits did.  I'd give this 4.5 stars if it were allowed, and how about that, Amazon/
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was completely engrossed in this book from the start. Riggs has put together such an original work that it will be hard to top. I see indications in GR that a Miss Peregrine #2 is in the works. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Riggs certainly left the story open-ended. But, I fear any attempt to add to the story will ultimately dilute it. I WILL read #2 though, when and if it comes. I hope I am not disappointed.<br /><br />5 STARS
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The picture and audio was perfect !  Loved the closing ending where they brought out all the original phantoms and honoring Andrew Lloyd Webber !!<br />Just wish They would do another stage video with Ramin and Sierra in Love Never Dies .
0307352153|5.0|This is a well-written, informative book that explains the differences between introverts and extroverts and repeatedly makes the case that we're all along the scale from one extreme to the other. Because we are all different our value to business, society, and personal relations need to be expressed differently.<br /><br />My only quibble is the author's mistaken belief that the World Wide Web _is_ the Internet rather than just one part of it. It's a common misconception but stands out in this book because her research and insights are otherwise so well done.
030788743X|5.0|Really enjoyed this wallow in 80's nostagia.  A hysterical side effect of reading the book, and sharing it with my 12 year old son is a mutual, and a bit bizarre, infatuation with online playiong of 80's arcade classics.  He is confident that he will figure out Pac Man and joust in no time.  Qbert is causing him to scratch his head, however.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Very sad at times, as was expected, but worthwhile insights, also as expected.  The combination of kindle book plus synced audiobook was a very pleasant experience!  Highly recommend!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Really good game .I love the graphics and all of the people you can fight .It's has a good set up for online  multiplayer .
B005VPXNV2|4.0|This is so well written. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat! It is hard to stop watching it.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Based on previous experience, this product performed as expected. It is worth the money! It could use a pocket for holding a stylus.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I love this game! I can't stop playing it!!!! =-) It's so much fun!! I totally suggest the purchase of this game!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|It is great entertainment for the children. They love dogs so this holds their attention. I would order more movies of this calliber.
B005TMSN4E|4.0|This works very well. Easy to use and most lenses mount easily. Unfortunately there is a bit of a lip at the bottom that prevents some thicker lenses such as the Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 di vc usd from mounting. This could prevent some of your lenses from mounting so be aware of that limitation.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I am a little sad not to know Sookie's future life. Like if she ever has a child or if her and Sam end up married, etc. Seems her other friends have their end, but hers still hangs some. Other than that, I like how all the main characters from previous books are brought into this final book.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The film was terrific and it was backed up by all this wonderful music!  So much talent in one musical score.  Terrific!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love everything about this App & I got it for free! I don't get a lot of time to play with a toddler running around, but when I do, I'm hooked!
0060853964|5.0|Arrived on time thought the condition was slightly worse than expected though just in the most minute ways. A hilarious read that wraps in around itself in creative ways
B000KIPT30|5.0|Behringer really hit it out of the park with this! I purchased it to use in my home studio, and it performs beautifully!<br /> Thanks Behringer!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|The pleasure I received was much better than the average jewel game!  Keep these coming.  Well worth the money I spent and will gladly buy the next one.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This was actually a replacement for the one I purchased years ago that finally gave up the ghost.  It is so handy to grab this and run it over my carpet instead of dragging out my heavy, cumbersome tank vacuum.  It really picks up everything on the surface.  You will be amazed!
B007CSWMWM|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie will touch your life. Our Junior class had to read it for a project, but I regret nothing.<br />It opened my eyes to the horrible disease ALS and how resilient man can be. If others chose to view their<br />life through Morrie's eyes, it show so much more promise. I recommend this to people of all ages. Well, above<br /> the age of ten years old. This is not due to any graphic content, but due to their maturity level. They might not understand his philosophical statements if they are too young. All in all, this is a great book and I hope you read it.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|When I sign up for facebook from the game first:starts connecting very slow and it don't start just force close!!!On my mobile it works super but on my Kindle Fire it doesn't work!!!Please fix that problem and then I will give 5 stars
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Still the best eReader I've found, though it's not really setup for importing books from other sources.  There are ways, and once the books are loaded, I like the kindle interface better than most.
1476734941|5.0|I like this book very much. I especially like the calorie chart so I can plan my small meals. There are also some helpful, and tasty, recipes. He writes in a friendly and readable manner. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in taking charge of his or her health.
B0016OOS16|5.0|It works great very compact and fits in the computer bag easily. It make working with a 3D model a dream compared to using a mouse.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game. Made you think and solve for the next step. No hidden object or mindless puzzles. You had to think outside the box at times which is a lot of fun. Looking forward to the next game by this company.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|This is by far the best news reader I have found for android.  Nicely organized without any additional attempt to insert extras, discover what I like, or to make my feeds look flashier.  Hopefully the devs have a plan for when google reader goes poof.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This bad boy absolutely does everything!!!  Shows me what I need to know about most whatever ails my Kindle Fire!! :)
B000T433CO|4.0|This is a reliable tear jerker. Love the California home, the home theater with all of it's movies displayed. Likely my favorite Jack Black character.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Have the Trilogy and read it like lightening. . . . have seen the first movie and am waiting impatiently for the next one!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie was outstanding and truly hilarious! Held my attention until the very end, and even then I was still wishing for more. Great movie!
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|Its an okay game. Gets kinda difficult and confusing  though. But all in all a great way to pass the time.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Am unable to play Angry Birds Friends as I do not have a Facebook account and do not want one.  That feature should be explained up front.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Just enough mystery and action. This is a new author for me but I am enjoying her multiple works and looking for more!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I would rate this a 5 because my little sister brooklyn 3 years old loves it. The first day we got it she got on the game right away. The game is also really fast loading.&lt;3
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good all around romp.  My 11 yr old loved it as he's into retro games.  It's a good all around family movie.
140053271X|5.0|Bought this for my wife for my wife for Christmas and she uses it every day. Already went through 22 books, most of them free through Barnes and Noble. A great buy and very happy it.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|This is quite possibly the best album of the year for me. This is what Rock and Roll is supposed to be .
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Awesome movies and a cool anniversary edition to keep! This one should be on all cult movie lovers' shelf. Thanks!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Was not interested at first, but after talking with people who enjoyed it, I just had to see all of the season.
B004YMTI26|5.0|i downloaded the mp3s, and it's a great listen.  they've found the perfect balance in their sound.  the vocals have been brought up a bit on the mix, so you can actually hear the vocals shining more!
0765322889|5.0|I'm reading through this series for the third time so I think I can say that I really like it. ;-)  There is lots of slashing and slaying in the epic fantasy style but generally nothing that will cause tender-hearted people to lie awake at night wishing they hadn't read some bit of a book.  (I've still got images in my head from other books that I wish I didn't have.)  Many of the characters are complex and as they come and go across 10,000 pages, you meet a lot of interesting and well-developed people.  Some of them are a hoot, too!<br /><br />I found that I could trust the author to not wantonly kill sympathetic characters that he had led me to care about, something that I hated in the Game of Thrones series.  Also, I'm fascinated by all the cross-references between the various books.  The first time through I didn't know the whole story so some sections were mysterious, making real sense only on the second (or third) reading.  It is more like a single complex story told across ten volumes than ten different stories using the same characters and world.  (I've read and enjoyed both kinds of series, but I now think that I somewhat prefer the one-story-across-many-books approach, since it can be richer in interwoven details.)<br /><br />In addition to a great story, interesting and unexpected subplots, and believable characters, Erickson has devised a really workable set of rules around magic, immortality, gods (in the small-g sense), and technology.  It hangs together in a way that some series do (Recluce by Modesitt) and some don't (technology in some Star Trek-derivative episodes).<br /><br />The series is now complete so you can read the entire thing without waiting for \\"the next book\\" to be published.  Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Horrible app. Ads, ads, ads. No thanks. I couldn't uninstall fast enough. Don't waste your time with this one. It is completely useless.
1451695195|5.0|Once you begin reading the book you will not want to put it down. Interesting to read from a Neurosurgeon's<br />perspective what many others have experienced.
B00338QENI|5.0|People got rich from this women's disease.<br />I worked with cloned HeLa cells as a virolgist.  Diagnosed viral diseases to preserve health and well being.<br />What a sadness that her family is just now benefiting and not because of the cell clones but because of the proceeds from thius book.<br />Shame on the medical establishement for not giving all health and wellness to HeLa's family!
1452110581|5.0|This is one of the funniest books that has come to me in a LONG time.  I bought this for my son and daughter-in-law, who have 4 cats.
B006DHASYM|5.0|I love this movie. It's funny, crazy and I love the whole story.  Also, Chris Evans isn't bad on the eyes either.
B00338QENI|4.0|If you enjoy science or not this book is well worth the time to read!  You will stop and think about all science has done.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Finally, I don't have to waste .99cents everytime I want to download a new song...this app rocks.<br />Works great most of the time, but I guess i've been using too much the last few days and toward the end of a very busy day<br />it sometimes locks up on me....but over all, i'm very impressed
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Yes this game is fun but tipping back becomes a time consuming chore, the pop ups, notifications, and re living every  challenge every other time i open my game is highly ANNOYING. I hate being bombarded with messages. For every good thing i have to say about this game i can think of a bad one.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Hidden objects could be more HD. But in general the graphics are interesting. Easy to complete the game in an evening. G5 games are always fun.
